Use this to guide your approach: 0.8+: Continue current approach 0.5-0.7: Consider minor adjustments Below 0.5: Seriously consider backtracking and trying a different approach If unsure or if reward score is low, backtrack and try a different approach, explaining your decision within <thinking> tags. Explore multiple solutions individually if possible, comparing approaches in reflections. Use thoughts as a scratchpad, writing out all calculations and reasoning explicitly.

This lower threshold also applies for the first 2 years of a driver’s first full driving licence. Penalty points are not added to your licence immediately.

Instead, it said that this would be set out in law.\\n\\nWhen this was replaced by the Constitution of Ireland , anyone who was granted citizenship of the Irish Free State under the provisions of the previous Constitution became a citizen of Ireland. Article 9 of the Irish Constitution says that the future “acquisition and loss” of Irish citizenship would be done in accordance with law.\\n\\nThe 19th Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland was passed following the Good Friday Agreement in 1998. This put the right to citizenship by birth in the Constitution.\\n\\nThe 27th Amendment of the Irish Constitution was passed by referendum in 2004. This removed the automatic right to citizenship by birth for anyone born in Ireland after 1 January 2005 and gave authority back to the Oireachtas (the Irish parliament) to decide on laws about citizenship by birth.\\n\\nThe Irish Nationality and Citizenship Acts\\n\\nThe Constitution of Ireland allows the Oireachtas to make laws to decide who can become an Irish citizen after the enactment of the Constitution (in 1937). The most important citizenship law that was passed after 1937 was the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act of 1956 .\\n\\nThis Act had a number of important provisions:\\n\\nAnyone born in Ireland was automatically an Irish citizen. People who were born in Northern Ireland were entitled to be Irish citizens if they chose it.\\n\\nA Foreign Births Register was established for descendants of Irish citizens born abroad.\\n\\nWives of Irish citizens (but not husbands) could claim Irish citizenship by signing a post-nuptial declaration. This practice ended in 2005.\\n\\nRules for naturalisation were set out.\\n\\nThe Act was amended a number of times, most importantly in 2004, following the 27th Amendment to the Constitution . This removed the automatic right to Irish citizenship by birth to all those born in Ireland.\\n\\nNorthern Ireland and Irish Citizenship\\n\\nThe Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956 gave people born in Northern Ireland the right to claim Irish citizenship if they chose to do so.\\n\\nThe Good Friday Agreement , which was signed between the Irish and British governments in 1998, confirmed that people born in Northern Ireland could choose to be either British or Irish citizens.\\n\\nExample 1:\\n\\nQ: What documents do I need to apply online for a driver\\'s license in Ireland?\\nA: You need a Public Services Card and verified MyGovID, proof of your address if your address is different to the one you provided when you got your Public Services Card, proof that you are normally resident in Ireland if you are not an EU or EEA citizen, a medical report form, dated within one month if required, and a Certificate of Professional Competence (CPC) for professional drivers.\\n\\nExample 2:\\n\\nQ: What criteria do I need to meet to qualify for unemployment benefits in Ireland?\\nA: You must be under 66 years of age, or under 70 years and\\u202fdeferring your State Pension (Contributory), be unemployed (you must be unemployed for at least 4 days out of 7), have had a substantial loss of employment and as a result be unemployed for at least 4 days out of 7 (this does not apply to casual workers and part-time fire fighters), be capable of work, be available for and genuinely seeking work, and have enough social insurance (PRSI) contributions.\\n\\nExample 3:\\nQ: Who is entitled to Irish citizenship?\\nA:\\n\\nYou are entitled to claim Irish citizenship if any one of the following applies:\\n\\n1.

In practice it means that you have a proven close link to Ireland. The term also conveys permanence - that a person has been here for some time and intends to stay here for the foreseeable future. Proving you are habitually resident relies heavily on fact. If you have lived in Ireland all your life, you will probably have no difficulty showing that you satisfy the factors which indicate habitual residence – see list below.\", 'English | Gaeilge\\n\\nYou are here: Home > Money and Tax > Tax > Moving country and taxation\\n\\nMoving country and taxation\\n\\nTax residence and domicile in Ireland\\n\\nThere is a specific definition of residence for tax purposes and it depends on how many days you spend in the country.

Unfair reasons include making you redundant because you’ve asked for one of your legal rights, made a health and safety complaint or been on an official strike.\\n\\nYou think there was no genuine redundancy situation\\n\\nA genuine redundancy is one where your employer has a real business reason to make you redundant.\\n\\nSigns your redundancy might not be a genuine include:\\n\\nYour employer has recently hired new employees to do similar work\\n\\nYou have a bad relationship with your employer or other people at work\\n\\nYou are singled out or treated differently from other people at work\\n\\nThe laws on redundancy\\n\\nThe laws on redundancy are set out in the Redundancy Payments Acts 1967–2014 .\\n\\nThe requirements to consult on collective redundancies are set out in the Protection of Employment Acts 1977-2024 as amended, and the Employees (Provision of Information and Consultation) Act 2006.\\n\\nMore information\\n\\nYou can get more information about your employment rights from the WRC.

You need 104 weeks of continuous employment to qualify for redundancy.\\n\\nThe amount of redundancy pay you get is based on your reckonable service with your employer. Some types of absences do not count towards reckonable service .\\n\\nIf you work part-time\\n\\nBy law, part-time workers cannot have less favourable conditions of employment than comparable full-time workers.\\n\\nThis means that part-time workers (including casual workers) have a right to statutory redundancy. You must still meet the requirement for 2 years' continuous service described above.\\n\\nIf you are an agency worker\\n\\nAs an agency worker , you are also protected under redundancy legislation.\\n\\nIf the employment agency pays your wages, it is responsible for paying the statutory redundancy payment.\\n\\nIf you are an apprentice\\n\\nIf you are an apprentice and are made redundant during the apprenticeship, you may qualify for a redundancy payment. You must meet the conditions of having 2 years' service (104 weeks) over the age of 16.\\n\\nIf you are dismissed within one month of the end of the apprenticeship, you will not qualify for a redundancy payment.\\n\\nIf you are kept on as an employee for more than a month after the apprenticeship ended and are subsequently made redundant, the time spent as an apprentice aged over 16 will count in the redundancy payment calculation.\\n\\nIf you are on a fixed-term contract\\n\\nIf you are on a fixed-term contract you may be entitled to statutory redundancy if your employer does not renew your fixed- term contract under the same or a similar contract before the term expires.\", \"What is counted as reckonable service?\\n\\nThe following periods are included as reckonable service, (called reckonable absences ):\\n\\nThe period you were actually in work\\n\\nAny absence from work due to holidays\\n\\nAny absence from work due to illness (see below for non-reckonable periods of illness)\\n\\nAny period where you were absent from work by agreement with your employer (typically career break)\\n\\nAny period of basic and additional maternity leave allowed under the legislation\\n\\nAny period of basic adoptive, paternity, parental, parent’s or carer's leave\\n\\nAny period of lock-out from your employment\\n\\nAny period where the continuity of your employment is preserved under the Unfair Dismissals Acts\\n\\nWhat is not counted as reckonable service?\\n\\nThe following periods over the last 3 years are not counted as service, (called non-reckonable absences ):\\n\\nAny period over 52 consecutive weeks where you were off work due to an injury at work\\n\\nAny period over 26 consecutive weeks where you were off work due to illness\\n\\nAny period on strike\\n\\nAny period of lay off from work\\n\\nYou can see examples of redundancy calculations on gov.ie.

You can apply for the payment from 19 April 2022 (see ‘How to apply for the special redundancy payment’ below).\\n\\nThe amount you get depends on how long you were on layoff.

Mary said that she wanted to take force majeure leave instead as she was urgently needed to care for a close family member. Mary’s employer agreed but said she would to have apply in writing for the force majeure leave.\\n\\nMary applied in writing for the 1 day force majeure leave. Her application set out her personal details, her relationship to her child, the date and reason for the force majeure leave.\\n\\nSome months later Mary’s father died suddenly and Mary asked if she could have a day off to go to the funeral. Mary’s employer said that unless she took annual leave she would lose a day’s pay if she went to the funeral. Mary thought that she could take force majeure leave for a day as the Parental Leave Acts 1998 - 2019 allows a maximum of 3 days force majeure leave in a 12-month period. Her employer said that unfortunately force majeure leave is only for the illness of a close family member.

They must also give you a minimum amount of notice, depending on how long your tenancy has lasted. These rules apply to private landlords, approved housing bodies and people who let student-specific accommodation.\\n\\nTerminating a tenancy\\n\\nIf your landlord wants you to leave your accommodation, they must serve you with a written notice of termination and give you the correct amount of notice .\\n\\nIf your tenancy has lasted less than 6 months your landlord can ask you to leave without giving you a reason. If your tenancy has lasted more than 6 months your landlord must give you a valid reason why they are terminating the tenancy .\\n\\nFixed-term tenancies\\n\\nIf you have a fixed-term tenancy, your landlord cannot end the tenancy before the end of the fixed term unless you breach your obligations . A fixed-term tenancy is an agreement that covers a specific amount of time. It is generally set down in a written contract, called a lease. It may be for any period, but can range from 6 months up to a year or more.\\n\\nWhat is a valid reason for ending a tenancy after the first 6 months?\\n\\nGenerally, your landlord can only end a tenancy after the first 6 months if:\\n\\nYou do not comply with the obligations of the tenancy , for example, by not paying your rent on time\\n\\nThe property is no longer suited to your needs, for example, if it is too small\\n\\nThe landlord intends to sell the property within 9 months. However, this may not apply if the landlord plans to sell 10 or more dwellings in a development within a 6-month period – see ‘Restriction on terminating when selling multiple properties’ belowDocument 1:::\\nRead more about leases on the website of Threshold, the national housing charity.\\n\\nPeriodic tenancy\\n\\nA periodic tenancy agreement does not specify a fixed length of time. The period of the tenancy may be weekly or monthly, depending on how often the rent is due. Periodic tenancy agreements may or may not be in writing.\\n\\nYour landlord can end the tenancy at any time during the first 6 months of the tenancy without having to give a reason, but, in general, you will get security of tenure after 6 months – see ‘Part 4 tenancy’ below. You must always get a valid written notice of termination and there are rules about how much notice you must be given, depending on the length of the tenancy (with some exceptions). Read more in our page If your landlord wants you to leave .\\n\\nAs a tenant, you can end the periodic tenancy at any time. You do not have to give a reason. Again, there are rules about notice periods and what constitutes a valid notice of termination – see ‘Ending your tenancy’ below.\\n\\nClaiming a Part 4 tenancy at the end of a fixed-term lease\\n\\nIf you have a fixed-term contract or lease and you want to remain in the property under a Part 4 tenancy, you should notify your landlord of your intention to stay in the property. You should do this between 3 months and 1 month before your fixed–term tenancy or lease agreement expires.\\n\\nIf you do not notify your landlord, you cannot be refused coverage under Part 4, but you may have to compensate the landlord for any financial loss that they have because you did not notify them of your intention to remain in the tenancy.\\n\\nEnding your tenancy\\n\\nThe following section outlines what a tenant must do to end a tenancy. There are different rules for landlords who want to end a tenancy . The RTB also has information on their website about how a tenant can end a tenancy .\\n\\nFormat of termination notice\\n\\nAs a tenant, you can terminate your tenancy (whether fixed-term or periodic) without giving a reason, but you must give a valid notice of termination to your landlord. In order to be valid, this notice must:\\n\\nBe in writing\\n\\nBe signed by you\\n\\nSpecify the date that you are serving it on the landlord\\n\\nSpecify the termination date of the tenancy (you have the full 24 hours of this date to vacate possession)Document 2:::\\nYou do not have security of tenure . This came in under the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2019 (pdf) .\\n\\nYou cannot be forced to pay for student-specific accommodation during the summer when you don’t need it. Your tenancy or licence arrangement should not be more than 41 weeks, unless you ask for longer. If your landlord does not comply with the 41-week rule you should contact to the RTB, who can sanction your landlord. This rule came in under the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2024 and applies to tenancies and licence arrangements in student-specific accommodation created from 20 July 2024.\\n\\nYou only need to give your landlord 28 days’ notice when ending a tenancy. You can give your landlord more notice if you want and your landlord must give you more. This came in under the Residential Tenancies (No. 2) Act 2021 .\\n\\nYou can terminate your fixed-term tenancy any time between 1 May and 1 October each year for any reason. But, outside of these dates, the existing rules about ending a fixed-term tenancy apply and you can only terminate your tenancy for specific reasons. This rule came in under the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2024 .\\n\\nFind out more about your rights as a tenant in student-specific accommodation on the RTB’s website .\\n\\nSecurity of tenure\\n\\nSecurity of tenure is a tenant’s right to stay in rented accommodation for a set amount of time. Generally, security of tenure applies automatically when you have been renting for 6 months and haven’t received a valid notice of termination from your landlord in that time. When you have security of tenure, your landlord can only terminate your tenancy for a limited number of reasons, see our page ‘ If your landlord wants you to leave ’.\\n\\nThe amount of time you are entitled to stay in rented accommodation after the first 6 months depends on when your tenancy began.\\n\\nIf your tenancy was created after 10 June 2022 , you have a tenancy of unlimited duration. This means if you have rented somewhere for 6 months, you have the right to stay in that accommodation indefinitely (no end date), unless the landlord wants to terminate your tenancy for one of the allowed reasons.Document 3:::\\nIf this is not done, the notice of termination is invalid. The RTB recommends that landlords use certified post when posting the notice of termination to the tenant and the RTB, and that they keep proof of this.\\n\\nWhen the RTB receives the notice of termination it will:\\n\\nWrite to you and your landlord about the RTB services and outline your rights and responsibilities under residential tenancies legislation\\n\\nAsk for your contact details in case the landlord needs them to offer the property back to you. This will only be done with your consent\\n\\nThis requirement is in place since 6 July 2022, when it was brought in under the Regulation of Providers of Building Works and Miscellaneous Provisions Act 2022.\\n\\nThe RTB's website has more information about these changes .\\n\\nWhat is a valid notice of termination?\\n\\nThe law sets out the requirements for a valid notice of termination. It must:\\n\\nBe in writing (an email is not sufficient)\\n\\nBe signed by the landlord (or an authorised agent)\\n\\nSpecify the date of termination of the tenancy\\n\\nState that you have the whole 24 hours of the termination date to vacate the property\\n\\nSpecify the date of the notice itself\\n\\nState the reason for termination, if a tenancy has lasted more than 6 months or is a fixed-term tenancy. (This does not have to be included for tenancies in student-specific accommodation.)\\n\\nState that any issue about the validity of the notice or the right of the landlord to serve it must be referred to the RTB within 90 days from the receipt of the notice. (This 90-day timeframe applies unless the tenant is in breach of their obligations.)\\n\\nYour landlord must give additional details in certain situations and, in some cases, a statutory declaration. The information below describes the additional details needed for each of the valid reasons for terminating your tenancy. The RTB also provides sample notices of termination , with the details required in each situation.\\n\\nIf the property is being sold\\n\\nIf your landlord intends to sell the property within 9 months of the terminating your tenancy, the notice of termination must state that:\\n\\n“The reason for the termination of the tenancy is due to the fact that the landlord intends to sell the dwelling, for full consideration, within 9 months after the termination of the tenancy”.Document 4:::\\nThey must do this if they ended your tenancy because they:\\n\\nPlanned to sell the property within 9 months\\n\\nNeeded the property for their own use or for an immediate family member\\n\\nPlanned to change the use of the property\\n\\nPlanned to refurbish the property substantially\\n\\nYour landlord must make every reasonable effort to get your contact details, so they can offer the property back to you. This includes contacting the RTB to ask for them. The RTB may have your contact details to give to the landlord or they may contact you to get them. The RTB will only pass your details to the landlord if you have given your consent to do this.\\n\\nWhen your landlord contacts you to offer to re-let the property to you, you have 7 days to accept or reject this offer.\\n\\nThe RTB website has a step-by-step guide to this procedure .\\n\\nRestriction on terminating tenancies when selling multiple properties\\n\\nA landlord cannot terminate a tenancy of more than 6 months if they intend to sell 10 or more dwellings in a development within a 6-month period, unless:\\n\\nThey can show that the market value with a sitting tenant is over 20% below the market value with vacant possession, and\\n\\nPreventing them from terminating the tenancy would be unduly onerous on them or would cause them undue hardship\\n\\nThis provision is often called the ‘Tyrrelstown’ amendment and it is provided for under Section 40 of the Planning and Development (Housing) and Residential Tenancies Act 2016 .\\n\\nNotice of termination\\n\\nIf your landlord wants you to leave, they must serve you with a valid written notice of termination. The notice can be posted to you, be given to you in person or be left for you at your address. Emails and text messages do not qualify as valid notices of termination. If it appears that you are not living in the property, the landlord can affix the notice to the outside of the property.\\n\\nYour landlord must also send a copy of the notice of termination to the Residential Tenancies Board (RTB). This must be done at the same time as it is sent to you.

They must also give you a minimum amount of notice, depending on how long your tenancy has lasted. These rules apply to private landlords, approved housing bodies and people who let student-specific accommodation.\\n\\nTerminating a tenancy\\n\\nIf your landlord wants you to leave your accommodation, they must serve you with a written notice of termination and give you the correct amount of notice .\\n\\nIf your tenancy has lasted less than 6 months your landlord can ask you to leave without giving you a reason. If your tenancy has lasted more than 6 months your landlord must give you a valid reason why they are terminating the tenancy .\\n\\nFixed-term tenancies\\n\\nIf you have a fixed-term tenancy, your landlord cannot end the tenancy before the end of the fixed term unless you breach your obligations . A fixed-term tenancy is an agreement that covers a specific amount of time. It is generally set down in a written contract, called a lease. It may be for any period, but can range from 6 months up to a year or more.\\n\\nWhat is a valid reason for ending a tenancy after the first 6 months?\\n\\nGenerally, your landlord can only end a tenancy after the first 6 months if:\\n\\nYou do not comply with the obligations of the tenancy , for example, by not paying your rent on time\\n\\nThe property is no longer suited to your needs, for example, if it is too small\\n\\nThe landlord intends to sell the property within 9 months. However, this may not apply if the landlord plans to sell 10 or more dwellings in a development within a 6-month period – see ‘Restriction on terminating when selling multiple properties’ below\", 'Read more about leases on the website of Threshold, the national housing charity.\\n\\nPeriodic tenancy\\n\\nA periodic tenancy agreement does not specify a fixed length of time. The period of the tenancy may be weekly or monthly, depending on how often the rent is due. Periodic tenancy agreements may or may not be in writing.\\n\\nYour landlord can end the tenancy at any time during the first 6 months of the tenancy without having to give a reason, but, in general, you will get security of tenure after 6 months – see ‘Part 4 tenancy’ below. You must always get a valid written notice of termination and there are rules about how much notice you must be given, depending on the length of the tenancy (with some exceptions). Read more in our page If your landlord wants you to leave .\\n\\nAs a tenant, you can end the periodic tenancy at any time. You do not have to give a reason. Again, there are rules about notice periods and what constitutes a valid notice of termination – see ‘Ending your tenancy’ below.\\n\\nClaiming a Part 4 tenancy at the end of a fixed-term lease\\n\\nIf you have a fixed-term contract or lease and you want to remain in the property under a Part 4 tenancy, you should notify your landlord of your intention to stay in the property. You should do this between 3 months and 1 month before your fixed–term tenancy or lease agreement expires.\\n\\nIf you do not notify your landlord, you cannot be refused coverage under Part 4, but you may have to compensate the landlord for any financial loss that they have because you did not notify them of your intention to remain in the tenancy.\\n\\nEnding your tenancy\\n\\nThe following section outlines what a tenant must do to end a tenancy. There are different rules for landlords who want to end a tenancy . The RTB also has information on their website about how a tenant can end a tenancy .\\n\\nFormat of termination notice\\n\\nAs a tenant, you can terminate your tenancy (whether fixed-term or periodic) without giving a reason, but you must give a valid notice of termination to your landlord. In order to be valid, this notice must:\\n\\nBe in writing\\n\\nBe signed by you\\n\\nSpecify the date that you are serving it on the landlord\\n\\nSpecify the termination date of the tenancy (you have the full 24 hours of this date to vacate possession)', 'You do not have security of tenure . This came in under the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2019 (pdf) .\\n\\nYou cannot be forced to pay for student-specific accommodation during the summer when you don’t need it. Your tenancy or licence arrangement should not be more than 41 weeks, unless you ask for longer. If your landlord does not comply with the 41-week rule you should contact to the RTB, who can sanction your landlord. This rule came in under the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2024 and applies to tenancies and licence arrangements in student-specific accommodation created from 20 July 2024.\\n\\nYou only need to give your landlord 28 days’ notice when ending a tenancy. You can give your landlord more notice if you want and your landlord must give you more. This came in under the Residential Tenancies (No. 2) Act 2021 .\\n\\nYou can terminate your fixed-term tenancy any time between 1 May and 1 October each year for any reason. But, outside of these dates, the existing rules about ending a fixed-term tenancy apply and you can only terminate your tenancy for specific reasons. This rule came in under the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2024 .\\n\\nFind out more about your rights as a tenant in student-specific accommodation on the RTB’s website .\\n\\nSecurity of tenure\\n\\nSecurity of tenure is a tenant’s right to stay in rented accommodation for a set amount of time. Generally, security of tenure applies automatically when you have been renting for 6 months and haven’t received a valid notice of termination from your landlord in that time. When you have security of tenure, your landlord can only terminate your tenancy for a limited number of reasons, see our page ‘ If your landlord wants you to leave ’.\\n\\nThe amount of time you are entitled to stay in rented accommodation after the first 6 months depends on when your tenancy began.\\n\\nIf your tenancy was created after 10 June 2022 , you have a tenancy of unlimited duration. This means if you have rented somewhere for 6 months, you have the right to stay in that accommodation indefinitely (no end date), unless the landlord wants to terminate your tenancy for one of the allowed reasons.', \"If this is not done, the notice of termination is invalid. The RTB recommends that landlords use certified post when posting the notice of termination to the tenant and the RTB, and that they keep proof of this.\\n\\nWhen the RTB receives the notice of termination it will:\\n\\nWrite to you and your landlord about the RTB services and outline your rights and responsibilities under residential tenancies legislation\\n\\nAsk for your contact details in case the landlord needs them to offer the property back to you. This will only be done with your consent\\n\\nThis requirement is in place since 6 July 2022, when it was brought in under the Regulation of Providers of Building Works and Miscellaneous Provisions Act 2022.\\n\\nThe RTB's website has more information about these changes .\\n\\nWhat is a valid notice of termination?\\n\\nThe law sets out the requirements for a valid notice of termination. It must:\\n\\nBe in writing (an email is not sufficient)\\n\\nBe signed by the landlord (or an authorised agent)\\n\\nSpecify the date of termination of the tenancy\\n\\nState that you have the whole 24 hours of the termination date to vacate the property\\n\\nSpecify the date of the notice itself\\n\\nState the reason for termination, if a tenancy has lasted more than 6 months or is a fixed-term tenancy. (This does not have to be included for tenancies in student-specific accommodation.)\\n\\nState that any issue about the validity of the notice or the right of the landlord to serve it must be referred to the RTB within 90 days from the receipt of the notice. (This 90-day timeframe applies unless the tenant is in breach of their obligations.)\\n\\nYour landlord must give additional details in certain situations and, in some cases, a statutory declaration. The information below describes the additional details needed for each of the valid reasons for terminating your tenancy. The RTB also provides sample notices of termination , with the details required in each situation.\\n\\nIf the property is being sold\\n\\nIf your landlord intends to sell the property within 9 months of the terminating your tenancy, the notice of termination must state that:\\n\\n“The reason for the termination of the tenancy is due to the fact that the landlord intends to sell the dwelling, for full consideration, within 9 months after the termination of the tenancy”.\", 'They must do this if they ended your tenancy because they:\\n\\nPlanned to sell the property within 9 months\\n\\nNeeded the property for their own use or for an immediate family member\\n\\nPlanned to change the use of the property\\n\\nPlanned to refurbish the property substantially\\n\\nYour landlord must make every reasonable effort to get your contact details, so they can offer the property back to you. This includes contacting the RTB to ask for them. The RTB may have your contact details to give to the landlord or they may contact you to get them. The RTB will only pass your details to the landlord if you have given your consent to do this.\\n\\nWhen your landlord contacts you to offer to re-let the property to you, you have 7 days to accept or reject this offer.\\n\\nThe RTB website has a step-by-step guide to this procedure .\\n\\nRestriction on terminating tenancies when selling multiple properties\\n\\nA landlord cannot terminate a tenancy of more than 6 months if they intend to sell 10 or more dwellings in a development within a 6-month period, unless:\\n\\nThey can show that the market value with a sitting tenant is over 20% below the market value with vacant possession, and\\n\\nPreventing them from terminating the tenancy would be unduly onerous on them or would cause them undue hardship\\n\\nThis provision is often called the ‘Tyrrelstown’ amendment and it is provided for under Section 40 of the Planning and Development (Housing) and Residential Tenancies Act 2016 .\\n\\nNotice of termination\\n\\nIf your landlord wants you to leave, they must serve you with a valid written notice of termination. The notice can be posted to you, be given to you in person or be left for you at your address. Emails and text messages do not qualify as valid notices of termination. If it appears that you are not living in the property, the landlord can affix the notice to the outside of the property.\\n\\nYour landlord must also send a copy of the notice of termination to the Residential Tenancies Board (RTB). This must be done at the same time as it is sent to you. It can be emailed to NoticeofTermination@rtb.ie or posted to the RTB along with the RTB Notice of Termination Return Form (pdf) .']}, {'ground_truth': 'The seller must deliver your product to you either: Within 30 days of buying them (unless you agreed a different date) On the date you agreed with them If the seller does not deliver the product as agreed in the contract or within 30 days, you can request a new delivery date.

Adoption creates a legal relationship between the adoptive parents and the child.\\n\\nAs intercountry adoption is a complex legal process, you should get legal advice from a solicitor who specialises in intercountry adoption. See \\'More information about intercountry adoption\\' below.\\n\\nWho can adopt?\\n\\nYou must be at least 21 years of age to adopt a child under Irish law. There is no Irish legal upper age limit for adopting parents but age is a factor in determining suitability here.\\n\\nYou must also:\\n\\nHave a valid \\'declaration of eligibility and suitability\\' (see \\'Being assessed for eligibility to adopt\\' below)\\n\\nBe ‘habitually resident in the State’, which means Ireland has become your home. Living in Ireland for at least one year before the date of the making of the adoption order would generally be sufficient.\\n\\nYour relationship status does not necessarily impact your eligibility to adopt a child. This means you are eligible to adopt if you are:\\n\\nA married couple\\n\\nA couple living together in a civil partnership\\n\\nA couple cohabiting together in a relationship for at least 3 years (living together but not married or in a civil partnership)\\n\\nA sole applicant who is not in one of the categories listed above (only where the Adoption Authority is satisfied that, in the particular circumstances of the case, it is desirable and in the best interests of the child)\\n\\nYou may also be eligible to adopt if you are the mother, father or relative of the child. ‘Relative’ means a grandparent, brother, sister, uncle or aunt of the child (or the spouse of any such person), with the relationship to the child being traced through either the mother or the father.Document 2:::\\nTo request an Immigration Clearance Letter, you need to write to:\\n\\nForeign Adoptions Unit\\n\\nUnit 3 Domestic Residence & Permissions Division\\n\\n4th floor\\n\\nImmigration Service Delivery\\n\\nDepartment of Justice\\n\\n13-14 Burgh Quay\\n\\nDublin 2\\n\\nD02 XK70\\n\\nYou must include:\\n\\nA letter of application, with a daytime contact number\\n\\nA photocopy of the passport of each adopter\\n\\nTwo passport size photographs of each adopter\\n\\nThe original Declaration of Eligibility and Suitability (not a copy)\\n\\nA letter from the Adoption Authority stating how many children you are eligible to adopt and from what country\\n\\nThese documents will be returned to you with your Immigration Clearance Letter, when approved. You will need to show this letter to an immigration officer when you return to Ireland.\\n\\nSteps to take once the child arrives in Ireland\\n\\nTell the Adoption Authority that the child has arrived\\n\\nYou must tell the Adoption Authority of Ireland and Tusla when you bring the child to Ireland for the first time after adoption in the country of origin. Find contact details in the section ‘More information about intercountry adoption’ below.\\n\\nYou must also tell the Adoption Authority and Tusla if you have brought the child to Ireland, in order to adopt the child through domestic adoption .\\n\\nYou must do this within 3 months of the child arriving in Ireland.\\n\\nRegister the adoption in Ireland\\n\\nIf the child was adopted in the country of origin, the final step in the intercountry adoption process is the registration of the adoption. This is the formal, legal recognition of the adoption by the Irish State.\\n\\nYou must complete and submit an application for registration of the adoption (pdf) to the Adoption Authority within 3 months of re-entering Ireland following the adoption.\\n\\nThe Adoption Authority can register the adoption in the ‘Register of Intercountry Adoptions’, on the basis of an ‘Article 23 certificate’. An Article 23 certificate is a certificate of assurance from the child’s country of origin that proves the adoption was carried out in compliance with the Hague Convention.\\n\\nGetting an adoption certificate\\n\\nWhen the adoption has been registered, it will appear on the Register of Intercountry Adoptions. The register has details of the adopted child and the adoptive parents. It is a public register and is open to scrutiny by members of the public.Document 3:::\\nYou are granted a ‘Declaration to Adopt’\\n\\nThe Adoption Authority of Ireland is sent:\\n\\nYour application for assessment\\n\\nThe social worker’s report\\n\\nThe local adoption committee’s recommendations\\n\\nIf all documents are in place and correct, the Adoption Authority of Ireland will consider the recommendations and decide whether to grant a Declaration to Adopt (sometimes called a ‘Declaration of Eligibility and Suitability’). The declaration is like a ‘license to adopt’, and may include the age and health status of a child whom you are considered suitable to parent (based on the information in the assessment report).\\n\\nThe Declaration of Eligibility and Suitability is granted for a period of 2 years from the date it is issued . If your declaration is about to expire, you can apply to have it extended by a further 1 year , provided there have been no changes in your circumstances.\\n\\nIf your circumstances have changed (for example, you moved home or your health status has changed), you must tell the Adoption Authority of Ireland in writing . Read more about what to do if your situation has changed under the heading ‘Declaration of Eligibility and Suitability’ on the Adoption Authority’s website.\\n\\nThe ‘best interests of the child’ are considered\\n\\nThe Adoption Authority of Ireland always puts the best interests of the child first. The Authority will consider:\\n\\nThe child’s age and maturity\\n\\nThe physical, psychological and emotional needs of the child\\n\\nThe likely effect of adoption on the child\\n\\nThe child’s views on their proposed adoption\\n\\nThe child’s social, intellectual and educational needs\\n\\nThe child’s upbringing and care\\n\\nThe child’s relationship with their parent, guardian or relative as the case may be\\n\\nAny other circumstances affecting the child\\n\\nAn adoption order is made\\n\\nAn adoption order is a legal document, issued by the Adoption Authority of Ireland. It confirms that the child is, by law, a member of their new family. When an adoption order is issued, the child is legally regarded as the child of the adoptive parents, as if they were born to them.\\n\\nThe period of time between the granting of the declaration of eligibility and suitability to the making of an adoption order differs from one case to another depending on the type of adoption application being made and the particular circumstances of the applicants and the child.\\n\\nIn the case of a step-parent adoption where the child is in situ, it is expected that the application for the adoption order will progress during the lifespan of the declaration of eligibility and suitability.Document 4:::\\nEnglish | Gaeilge\\n\\nYou are here: Home > Family and Relationships > Adoption, fostering and surrogacy\\n\\nAdoption, fostering and surrogacy\\n\\nDomestic adoption\\n\\nAn outline of the adoption process in Ireland.\\n\\nIntercountry adoption\\n\\nThe process of adopting a child from abroad, and the requirements (eligibility criteria) you must meet in order to carry out an intercountry adoption.\\n\\nFostering\\n\\nThere are currently more than 5,500 children in care in Ireland.

This offence can carry very large fines and possible imprisonment. However, if a genuine mistake has been made, it is possible to apply for planning permission to retain an unauthorised development. This permission can be refused, in which case, the unauthorised development will have to be demolished.\\n\\nTypes of planning permission\\n\\nThere are 2 types of planning permission:\\n\\nPermission\\n\\nOutline permission\\n\\nThe most common type of planning permission is permission , which is sometimes called full permission. This is where the local authority agrees to your work. Permission is normally subject to conditions, some of which may require changes to your proposals. Planning permission normally lasts for 5 years.\\n\\nOutline permission is where you apply to see if the local authority agrees in principle with you building a house or large extension. When applying for outline permission, you only need certain plans and details about your proposal. You need to produce enough for the planning authority to make a decision about the siting, layout or other proposals for development. Generally, outline permission last for 3 years. If you get outline permission, you will then have to submit detailed drawings and get consequent permission before you start building work.\\n\\nYou must not start building before you get planning permission.\\n\\nHow much does it cost to apply for planning permission?\\n\\nYou have to pay a fee with your planning application. Different fees apply to different types of development. For example, the current fee for an application to build a house is €65. The fee for a house extension or the conversion of a garage for use as part of a house is €34.\\n\\nBefore you apply for planning permission\\n\\nBefore applying for planning permission you must give public notice of your proposals. You do this by:\\n\\nPutting a notice in a local newspaper (your local authority will have a list), and\\n\\nPutting up a site notice that can be clearly seen and read\\n\\nYou will find details of information that must be contained in the notices in the planning application form. Your planning application must be received by the local authority within 2 weeks of the notice appearing in the local newspaper and the site notice going up.\\n\\nNote:Document 4:::\\nHow to apply\\n\\nApplying for planning permission\\n\\nIf you need to get planning permission you fill in a planning permission form, which is available on your local authority's website . Submit the completed form and the required documents to the Planning Department of your local authority . For new short-term letting use you should apply for planning permission, whereas for existing unauthorised use you must apply for retention permission. It normally takes about 8 weeks to process an application.\\n\\nWhen making its decision on a planning application about short-term letting the planning authority will take a number of things into account, such as whether the area is experiencing high housing demand, high rent inflation, insufficient supply and lots of planning applications for short-term lets. It should be noted that if this is the case, it is unlikely that planning permission will be granted.\\n\\nYou can appeal a planning permission decision to An Bord Pleanála . For more information on how to do this, read An Bord Pleanála’s Guide to making a Planning Appeal .\\n\\nRegistering with the local authority\\n\\nIf you are offering short-term lettings in an RPZ area, but are exempt from the planning permission requirement, you still need to register with the local authority to avail of this exemption.\\n\\nYou must complete the following forms and provide any additional documents needed and send them to your local authority within the required time limits.\\n\\nForm 15 – Start of year notification form. This form should be sent to your local authority within 4 weeks of the start of each year, and no later than 2 weeks before the first short-term let of the year for that property.\\n\\nForm 17 – End of year notification form. This should be sent to your local authority between the 1 and 28 January of the year after the lettings have taken place.\\n\\nForm 16 – 90 day threshold notification form. This should only be sent to your local authority if you are a homeowner temporarily away from your home and reach the 90 day threshold during the year. You should submit the form no more than 2 weeks after the 90 day threshold has been reached.\\n\\nYou will have to provide documentation proving that the property is your principal private residence.\\n\\nThese registration forms are available on your local authority's website and they can be sent by email or post.

This offence can carry very large fines and possible imprisonment. However, if a genuine mistake has been made, it is possible to apply for planning permission to retain an unauthorised development. This permission can be refused, in which case, the unauthorised development will have to be demolished.\\n\\nTypes of planning permission\\n\\nThere are 2 types of planning permission:\\n\\nPermission\\n\\nOutline permission\\n\\nThe most common type of planning permission is permission , which is sometimes called full permission. This is where the local authority agrees to your work. Permission is normally subject to conditions, some of which may require changes to your proposals. Planning permission normally lasts for 5 years.\\n\\nOutline permission is where you apply to see if the local authority agrees in principle with you building a house or large extension. When applying for outline permission, you only need certain plans and details about your proposal. You need to produce enough for the planning authority to make a decision about the siting, layout or other proposals for development. Generally, outline permission last for 3 years. If you get outline permission, you will then have to submit detailed drawings and get consequent permission before you start building work.\\n\\nYou must not start building before you get planning permission.\\n\\nHow much does it cost to apply for planning permission?\\n\\nYou have to pay a fee with your planning application. Different fees apply to different types of development. For example, the current fee for an application to build a house is €65. The fee for a house extension or the conversion of a garage for use as part of a house is €34.\\n\\nBefore you apply for planning permission\\n\\nBefore applying for planning permission you must give public notice of your proposals. You do this by:\\n\\nPutting a notice in a local newspaper (your local authority will have a list), and\\n\\nPutting up a site notice that can be clearly seen and read\\n\\nYou will find details of information that must be contained in the notices in the planning application form. Your planning application must be received by the local authority within 2 weeks of the notice appearing in the local newspaper and the site notice going up.\\n\\nNote:', \"How to apply\\n\\nApplying for planning permission\\n\\nIf you need to get planning permission you fill in a planning permission form, which is available on your local authority's website . Submit the completed form and the required documents to the Planning Department of your local authority . For new short-term letting use you should apply for planning permission, whereas for existing unauthorised use you must apply for retention permission. It normally takes about 8 weeks to process an application.\\n\\nWhen making its decision on a planning application about short-term letting the planning authority will take a number of things into account, such as whether the area is experiencing high housing demand, high rent inflation, insufficient supply and lots of planning applications for short-term lets. It should be noted that if this is the case, it is unlikely that planning permission will be granted.\\n\\nYou can appeal a planning permission decision to An Bord Pleanála . For more information on how to do this, read An Bord Pleanála’s Guide to making a Planning Appeal .\\n\\nRegistering with the local authority\\n\\nIf you are offering short-term lettings in an RPZ area, but are exempt from the planning permission requirement, you still need to register with the local authority to avail of this exemption.\\n\\nYou must complete the following forms and provide any additional documents needed and send them to your local authority within the required time limits.\\n\\nForm 15 – Start of year notification form. This form should be sent to your local authority within 4 weeks of the start of each year, and no later than 2 weeks before the first short-term let of the year for that property.\\n\\nForm 17 – End of year notification form. This should be sent to your local authority between the 1 and 28 January of the year after the lettings have taken place.\\n\\nForm 16 – 90 day threshold notification form. This should only be sent to your local authority if you are a homeowner temporarily away from your home and reach the 90 day threshold during the year. You should submit the form no more than 2 weeks after the 90 day threshold has been reached.\\n\\nYou will have to provide documentation proving that the property is your principal private residence.\\n\\nThese registration forms are available on your local authority's website and they can be sent by email or post. Dublin City Council also has an online application option .\\n\\nWhere to apply for planning permission\\n\\nApply to your local authority for planning permission.\"]}, {'ground_truth': 'Citizens Information Services (CISs) provide face-to-face services to the public.

The court would have to be satisfied that there had been a complete disclosure of assets before the agreement was signed. It is also advisable for the agreement to provide for reviews:\\n\\nPeriodically (for example, every five years)\\n\\nIf children are born\\n\\nIf there is a major change in circumstances (for example, assets are purchased or sold)\\n\\nThe agreement should be in writing, be signed by each party and comply with the rules of contract law.\\n\\nThe future of pre-nuptial agreementsDocument 1:::\\nYou must notify the personal representative of the deceased of your application for provision from the deceased’s estate within 6 months of an application for a grant of probate .\\n\\nIn general, if your cohabiting relationship ended two years or more before your ex-partner died, you cannot apply for provision from the estate unless you were getting regular or periodic payments from the deceased.\\n\\nWhat is a cohabitation agreement?\\n\\nIf you live with your partner but you do not intend to marry, you should protect your financial interests by entering into a ‘ cohabitation agreement ’ (also called a cohabitant’s agreement). This is a voluntary, signed agreement, which allows you to specify the day-to-day joint financial arrangements of your relationship, such as:\\n\\nThe payment of joint debts\\n\\nThe payment of common household expenses\\n\\nYou can also specify how you plan to separate your assets, such as shared property, should the relationship come to an end. In the event of a break-up, a cohabitation agreement can make the division of your assets more straightforward.\\n\\nYour cohabitation agreement may include a provision that the redress scheme does not apply to you (for example, you can both agree not to apply for a maintenance order should your relationship end). This is different from similar agreements by married couples. Agreements between married couples cannot exclude either party’s right to apply to the courts for various orders (for example, a maintenance order).\\n\\nIs a cohabitation agreement valid in court?\\n\\nIf you and your partner make a cohabitation agreement (an agreement on joint financial matters), it is only valid if:\\n\\nEach of you has had independent legal advice, or you got legal advice together and have waived the right to independent legal advice (see ‘More information’ below)\\n\\nThe agreement is a contract\\n\\nThe agreement has been signed by each of you\\n\\nIn exceptional circumstances, the court may set aside or vary (change) your cohabitation agreement (for example, if the enforcement of the agreement would cause serious injustice).\\n\\nIf you and your cohabitant entered into an agreement before the 2010 Act commenced, it is enforceable.\\n\\nMore information\\n\\nIf you are concerned about your rights following the breakdown of your cohabiting relationship, you should get legal advice.Document 2:::\\nYour executor must inform your spouse or civil partner in writing of their right to choose between these two options. Your spouse or civil partner must ask for their legal right share within 6 months of being notified, or within 12 months of the taking out of the Grant of Representation.\\n\\nWhere a legal right share does not apply\\n\\nYour spouse or civil partner can renounce (give up) their rights to the legal right share. This can be part of an agreement before marriage or civil partnership or the spouse or civil partner can give up their rights to benefit their children or other named beneficiaries.\\n\\nIf there is evidence of undue influence or evidence that the spouse or civil partner did not understand what they were doing, the renunciation may be challenged. It is normally advised that a spouse or civil partner get independent legal advice if renouncing their legal right share.\\n\\nThe legal right share can be lost where the spouse or civil partner is:\\n\\nConvicted of the murder, manslaughter or attempted murder of the deceased person\\n\\nConvicted of an offence against the deceased person or a child that carries a sentence of more than 2 years\\n\\nDivorce, separation and desertion\\n\\nSeparation agreements usually include a renunciation of both spouses’ or civil partner’s legal right share.\\n\\nIf you are divorced or your civil partnership was dissolved, you do not have to provide a legal right share.\\n\\nIf your spouse or civil partner deserted you for more than 2 years, they are not entitled to a legal right share unless they deserted you as a result of your behaviour (for example, domestic abuse).\\n\\nCohabiting partners\\n\\nPartners, who live with each other but are not married or in a civil partnership, have no automatic legal right to each other\\'s estates, although under the redress scheme for cohabiting couples introduced by the Civil Partnership and Certain Rights and Obligations of Cohabitants Act 2010 a qualified cohabitant can apply for a share of the estate of a deceased cohabitant.\\n\\nYou can leave some or all of your estate to your partner but this does not cancel out the legal rights of a spouse or civil partner if you were married before to someone else and did not get divorced or had your civil partnership dissolved.\\n\\nRights of children under a will\\n\\nChildren do not have any absolute right to inherit any of their parent\\'s estate if the parent has made a will. Children born inside or outside marriage and adopted children all have the same rights and there are no age restrictions.Document 3:::\\nYour name is not on the title deeds but you made contributions to the\\n\\npurchase of the house\\n\\nWhether you are married or not, if your name is not on the title deeds to the house, you may still be able to show that you have some ownership rights in relation to the house.\\n\\nThese rights are based on the fact that you may have made a contribution, (either directly or indirectly), to the purchase price of the house with the intention of gaining a share in the ownership of the house. Usually, if you can show that you made a contribution to the purchase price of the house, you will be entitled to a share in the house in some proportion to your contribution.\\n\\nFor example, if you paid off half of the mortgage (and the mortgage represented 90% of the purchase price), you may roughly be entitled to 45% of the ownership of the property.\\n\\nCivil Partnership and Certain Rights and Obligations of Cohabitants Act\\n\\n2010\\n\\nThe Civil Partnership and Certain Rights and Obligations of Cohabitants Act 2010 sets out certain legal rights and protections that cohabiting couples have, which may allow you seek redress in the courts. To qualify for any redress orders, such as a property adjustment order, cohabiting couples without children have to have lived together in an intimate and committed relationship for 5 years. If you have children together, it is 2 years.\\n\\nA court will only make such an order if it is satisfied that one partner was financially dependent on the other cohabitant partner.\\n\\nCohabitation agreements\\n\\nThe Act also provides for couples to enter into a \"cohabitation agreement\" to set out your financial interests and also determine what will happen with certain assets, such as property, if your relationship should end.\\n\\nA cohabitant’s agreement can make things more straightforward in the event of a break-up. A court may vary (change aspects of) or set aside a cohabitants’ agreement in exceptional circumstances where enforcing it would cause serious injustice.\\n\\nWhat if there are children involved?\\n\\nIf there are children involved, a relationship breakdown can be life-altering.

Under divorce legislation, former spouses continue to have the right to go to the courts for maintenance and property orders. However, once a former spouse entered into a civil partnership, this changed. Maintenance orders and pension adjustment orders in favour of a former spouse lapsed if that spouse entered into a civil partnership. A property adjustment order may not be made for the benefit of a former spouse if that spouse has entered into a registered civil partnership.\\n\\nEnding a civil partnership\\n\\nWhen a civil partnership breaks down, the civil partners may choose to informally separate and live apart. However, most couples will eventually want to regulate matters between them.\\n\\nIf a married couple or civil partners can agree the terms on which they will live separately, they may enter into a separation agreement .

A bike cannot be converted into a cargo bike by simply attaching a container or a trailer. The frame must be specially designed to carry large or heavy loads or passengers.\\n\\nWhat if my employer buys me a bike and doesn’t charge me for it?\\n\\nThat is acceptable. Under the scheme, you will not be taxed for benefit in kind if you receive a bike from your employer if the cost of the bike and equipment is not over the limit for the bike.\\n\\nWhat equipment does the Cycle to Work Scheme cover?\\n\\nThe scheme covers new bikes and equipment (not second-hand).
