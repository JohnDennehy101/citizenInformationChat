###  Planning a journey

Before you start your journey, you can use [ Transport for Ireland’s (TFI)
online journey planner ](https://www.transportforireland.ie/plan-a-journey/)
to plan your journey.

The journey planner will give you information about bus and rail routes all
over Ireland. It will also tell you if a service is wheelchair accessible.

If you can’t travel alone, you may be able to get a free travel pass for your
travel companion. You can get more information in our page on [ free travel in
Ireland ](/en/social-welfare/extra-social-welfare-benefits/free-travel/) .

##  Travel Assistance Scheme

The [ Travel Assistance Scheme ](https://www.transportforireland.ie/travel-
assistance-scheme/) helps people with disabilities to use public transport in
the greater Dublin area and in Cork, Limerick and Waterford cities. The scheme
is free and is available for people over 18 years.

Under the scheme, a travel assistant can travel with you the first few times
you are travelling and offer advice on how to plan your journey. The assistant
will help you get used to travelling along that route on your own. You can
contact them when you are starting a new route.

The Travel Assistance Scheme in Dublin is available for [ Dublin Bus
](https://www.dublinbus.ie/accessibilityhome) , [ Go-Ahead Ireland
](https://www.goaheadireland.ie/accessibility) , [ DART
](https://www.irishrail.ie/travel-information/accessibility-onboard-trains)
and [ Luas ](https://luas.ie/accessibility.html) services. It is run by Dublin
Bus, but they provide the service across different transport providers.

To find out more, contact Dublin Bus by:

  * Phone: 01 703 3204 
  * Email: [ customercomment@dublinbus.ie ](mailto:customercomment@dublinbus.ie)

The Travel Assistance Scheme in Cork, Limerick and Waterford are available for
city buses and Iarnród Éireann commuter trains.

To find out more, contact Bus Éireann by:

  * Phone: 0818 836611 
  * Email: [ travelassistancecork@buseireann.ie ](mailto:travelassistancecork@buseireann.ie)

##  JAM Card and App

###  What is the JAM Card and JAM App?

The [ JAM Card ](https://www.jamcard.org/) is a card or app that tells other
passengers that you need a little more time because you have a condition or a
disability. It can be a physical card or an app on your phone or both.

This card helps passengers with a communication barrier to say that they need
“just a minute” and to ask for patience. The JAM Card and App are free.

###  How can I get a JAM Card?

You can get it in any of the following 3 ways:

  * [ Order a physical card online ](https://jamcard.org/register/get-a-card) . 
  * Phone the NOW Group (based in UK) on 0044 28 9043 6400. 
  * [ Download the app from the Play Store or Apple ](https://www.jamcard.org/jam-card-for-me) . 

###  How do I use it?

You show your JAM Card to the person that you are interacting with (for
example, the bus driver). The card says ‘Just A Minute’ on one side, and you
can choose which message you would like on the other side of your card.

The message could say any of the following:

  * I have autism 
  * I am autistic 
  * I have a condition 
  * I have a learning difficulty or a disability 
  * I have an intellectual disability 

With the app, you can choose your own message.

###  Where can I use it?

You can use it on public transport and in shops, banks, cafés, restaurants,
hotels and museums.

Find out more at [ jamcard.org ](https://jamcard.org/) or the [ Transport for
Ireland ](https://www.transportforireland.ie/jam-card/) website.

##  Please Offer Me a Seat Badge and Card

###  What is the Please Offer Me a Seat Badge and Card?

The badge and card are for people with invisible disabilities to use when
using public transport. If you have an invisible disability and have
difficulty standing while using public transport, the badge or card will help
you to subtly alert other passengers that you would like to be offered a seat.

Some examples of invisible disabilities are fibromyalgia, autism, head
injuries, chronic pain, poor balance, and multiple sclerosis, along with other
conditions.

###  How can I get it?

You can contact your [ local TFI public transport operator
](https://www.transportforireland.ie/please-offer-me-a-seat-badge-card/) to
get one.

###  Where can I use it?

You can use the badge on Dublin Bus, Bus Éireann, Iarnród Éireann—Irish Rail,
Luas, Go-Ahead Ireland, and TFI Local Link services.

Find out more at the [ Transport for Ireland
](https://www.transportforireland.ie/news/tfi-launches-badge-and-card-for-
passengers-with-invisible-disabilities/) website.

wheelchair can be up to 70cm wide and 120cm long.

to give you extra time to get to your seat before the bus pulls away from the
stop.

To leave the bus, press the button with the wheelchair symbol on it, next to
the wheelchair space, shortly before your stop. This bell has its own sound
which lets the driver know that you wish to leave the bus.
