#  Tax reliefs for people with a vision impairment

  * Introduction 
  * Blind Person’s Tax Credit 
  * Guide Dog Allowance 
  * Value Added Tax (VAT) Refunds 
  * How to apply 

##  Introduction

If you are blind or partially sighted, you may entitled to a reduction in the
amount of tax that you pay.

Tax credits and reliefs reduce the amount of tax that you pay to [ Revenue
](http://www.revenue.ie) . You can read about [ how your tax is calculated
](/en/money-and-tax/tax/income-tax/how-your-tax-is-calculated/) for an
explanation of how they work.

If you are blind, you can claim the Blind Person’s Tax Credit.

If you have a guide dog, you can apply for the Guide Dog Allowance.

In addition, refunds are available for Value Added Tax (VAT) you have paid on
certain aids and appliances.

##  Blind Person’s Tax Credit

The [ Blind Person’s Tax Credit ](https://revenue.ie/en/personal-tax-credits-
reliefs-and-exemptions/health-and-age/blind-tax-credit/index.aspx) is €1,650.
For a married couple or civil partners, where both are blind, the credit is
€3,300.

Parents cannot claim a Blind Person’s Tax Credit in respect of any children
who are blind, but you can claim the [ Incapacitated Child Tax Credit
](/en/money-and-tax/tax/tax-credits-and-reliefs-for-people-with-
disabilities/incapacitated-child-tax-credit/) .

To apply for the Blind Person's Tax Credit, you must have a certificate from
an ophthalmic surgeon (a doctor who performs eye surgery). The certificate
must state that either:

  * Your best vision is not better than 6/60 vision in the better eye with glasses or contact lenses or 
  * Your field of vision is limited to within an angle of 20 degrees or less 

The certificate should state whether the visual impairment is permanent or
temporary. If it is temporary, you will need a certificate for each year you
claim the credit. If it is permanent, you continue to get the tax credit
indefinitely.

##  Guide Dog Allowance

Guide dogs are especially trained to lead people who are blind or vision
impaired around obstacles.

You can get a tax allowance if you, or your spouse, have a trained guide dog.

The [ Guide Dog Allowance ](https://www.revenue.ie/en/personal-tax-credits-
reliefs-and-exemptions/health-and-age/guide-dog-allowance/index.aspx) is €825.
The relief is given at the standard income tax rate of 20%, so it reduces your
tax by €165 (20% of €825).

To claim the allowance you must have a letter from Irish Guide Dogs for the
Blind confirming that you are a registered owner.

##  Value Added Tax (VAT) Refunds

You can apply for a refund of VAT you have paid on certain aids and
appliances. For example:

  * Braille books or Braille writing equipment 
  * Specially adapted computer equipment 

[ Read more about VAT refunds on aids and appliances used by people with
disabilities ](/en/money-and-tax/tax/tax-credits-and-reliefs-for-people-with-
disabilities/vat-refunds-on-aids-and-appliances-used-by-people-with-
disabilities/) .
