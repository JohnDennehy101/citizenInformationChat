##  What is a credit note?

A credit note is a paper or electronic note issued by a business to a customer
in place of a refund. A credit note acts like a voucher that can only be used
for the particular shop, chain of shops or business that issued the credit
note.

##  Is it legal for a business to offer me a credit note instead of a refund?

Yes, businesses are legally allowed to **offer** you a credit note in place of
a refund. In some cases a shop may give you a credit note as a goodwill
gesture, for example if you change your mind about something you bought (for
products bought in a shop, you do not have a legal right to a refund because
you change your mind).

However, if you are legally entitled to a refund, then the business cannot
insist that you accept a credit note or voucher instead (except in very
limited cases for package holidays – see below).

In general terms, you have a legal right (also called your _statutory right_ )
to a refund for:

  * Items or services bought online which you cancel or return during the ‘cooling off period’ 
  * Flight cancellations and package holiday cancellations – see more below 

You also have a legal right to certain _remedies_ if a product breaks, is not
fit for purpose or does not do what the advert or seller said it would. A
remedy could be a repair, replacement or a refund.

You can read more in our documents on [ your rights as a consumer in Ireland
](/en/consumer/consumer-laws/your-consumer-rights/) and [ consumer rights in
the EU ](/en/consumer/consumer-laws/your-consumer-rights/) .

##  Do I have to accept a credit note or voucher?

In general, you do not have to accept a credit note if your complaint is
covered by consumer law (except in very limited cases for package holidays –
see below). Instead, you can insist on a repair, a replacement or a refund.

If you accept a credit note you may not be able to ask for a refund
afterwards.

##  Airline credit notes and vouchers

Where your flight is cancelled, you are entitled to a choice of:

  * Refund of the cost of your ticket within 7 days or 
  * Re-routing to your final destination at the earliest opportunity or 
  * Re-routing at a later date at your convenience, subject to availability of seats 

A refund in this case means a cash refund (or a refund onto the original
method of payment, where you paid by debit card or credit card or by cheque or
bank order). Airlines can offer a refund by means of a credit note or a
voucher but you do not have to accept this and can insist on getting a full
refund.

These rules are set out in [ EU Regulation 261/2004(pdf)
](http://www.aviationreg.ie/_fileupload/Image/Regulation EC261 2004.pdf) .
