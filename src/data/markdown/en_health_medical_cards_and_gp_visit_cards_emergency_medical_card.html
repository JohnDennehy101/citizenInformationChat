#  Emergency medical cards

  * Introduction 
  * Rules 
  * Further information 

##  Introduction

An emergency medical card is a medical card that is issued without a means
test in certain emergency situations.

You can get an emergency medical card if you:

  * Have a terminal illness and have been told you have 24 months or less to live or 
  * Are receiving end-of-life treatment or 
  * Need urgent ongoing care and urgently need a medical card 

##  Rules

Only a healthcare professional (for example, a doctor or consultant) can apply
for an [ emergency medical card ](https://www2.hse.ie/services/medical-
cards/emergency-medical-cards.html) for you.

###  Terminal illness

You can get a medical card if you have a terminal illness and have been told
you have 24 months or less to live.

Your hospital consultant will send a [ Terminal illness medical card
application form (pdf) ](https://www2.hse.ie/file-library/medical-
cards/terminal-illness-emergency-medical-card-application-form-mc1t.pdf) to
the HSE stating that you have a terminal illness and have 24 months or less to
live.

Your medical card number will be active on the system within 24 hours of your
application being processed. You can access medical card services while you
wait for your card in the post.

Your medical card will never be reviewed and it will not expire.

###  If you are receiving end-of-life treatment

You will get a medical card if you have a terminal illness and you are
receiving end-of-life treatment. End-of-life treatment means you have been
told you have less than 12 months left to live.

Your social worker, consultant or GP will send the HSE a medical report and an
[ End-of-life treatment medical card application form (pdf)
](https://www2.hse.ie/file-library/medical-cards/end-of-life-care-medical-
card-application-form-mc1e.pdf) . A medical officer will process the
application straight away.

Your medical card number will be active on the system within 24 hours of your
application being processed. You can access medical card services while you
wait for your card in the post.

Your medical card will never be reviewed and it will not expire.

###  If you need urgent ongoing care

You can get a temporary medical card for 6 months if you need urgent ongoing
care and need a medical card sooner than the normal processing time.

Your social worker, consultant or GP will send a medical report and a
completed [ application form (pdf) ](https://www2.hse.ie/file-library/medical-
cards/end-of-life-care-medical-card-application-form-mc1e.pdf) to the HSE.

If your application is approved, it can take 10 days to get your emergency
medical card in the post. However, your medical card number will be active
within 24 hours of your application being processed, so you can get the care
you need.

You will need to [ apply for a standard means-tested medical card
](https://www2.hse.ie/services/medical-cards/medical-card-application-
process/how-to-apply-for-a-medical-card.html) before your emergency medical
card expires. The HSE will write to you to remind you to do this.

##  Further information

Only a healthcare professional can apply for an [ emergency medical card
](https://www2.hse.ie/services/medical-cards/emergency-medical-cards.html) for
you. They must send a detailed medical report with an application form
including your diagnosis, planned treatment and the prognosis (outlook).

If you have a terminal illness and have been told you have 24 months or less
to live, they only need to send a completed application form. A medical report
is not required.

For more information phone the National Medical Card Unit on 0818 22 44 78
(LoCall) or email: clientregistration@hse.ie
