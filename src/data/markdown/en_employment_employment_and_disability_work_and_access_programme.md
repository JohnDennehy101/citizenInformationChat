access-supports/?referrer=https://www.gov.ie/workandaccess/) employment
programme offers various supports to help people with disabilities find or
keep a job.

The programme aims to remove or reduce workplace barriers and help employers
provide reasonable steps to accommodate the needs of employees and job
applicants with disabilities (known as _reasonable accommodation_ ).

###  **Programme background**

The Work and Access Programme replaces the Department of Social Protection’s
Reasonable Accommodation Fund and the Disability Awareness Support Scheme.
