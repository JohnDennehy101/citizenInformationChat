##  Owning a dog

Owning a dog is a big commitment. If you own a dog, the dog is your
responsibility. You must have a dog licence and get your dog microchipped.
There are also additional responsibilities if you have a [ restricted breed of
dog ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/environment/pets-and-
wildlife/control-of-dogs/#5a28ab) .

Your dog must be under your control, or the control of another responsible
person if it is outside your home or premises. This means that:

  * You should make sure your dog is not a nuisance to others 
  * You must follow the rules about where dogs are welcome 
  * You should keep your dog on a lead in public places 

You are responsible for any injury or damage your dog causes to people or
livestock.

From, 1 October 2024, there will be new rules for people who own, breed, sell
and import XL Bully dogs. Read more on this in [ Restricted breeds of dog in
Ireland ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/environment/pets-and-
wildlife/control-of-dogs/#5a28ab) .

###  **Before you get a dog**

Before getting a dog, you should consider if a dog is right for you and your
home. You should ask yourself these questions:

  * Does everyone in the house agree to getting a dog? 
  * Can I afford to feed and care for a dog? 
  * Will I have time to feed, care for and exercise my dog each day? 
  * What type of dog should I get, for example, which breed would best to suit my lifestyle and home? 
  * Who will look after my dog when I’m away from home? 
  * Will my landlord let me have a dog 

It can be expensive owning and caring for a dog. You need to pay for things
like:

  * The dog 
  * Dog food 
  * Bedding, collars and accessories 
  * A dog licence 
  * Microchipping 
  * Veterinary care 
  * Vaccinations 
  * Neutering 
  * Grooming 
  * Dog training 
  * Boarding fees 

###  **Where to get a dog**

If you have decided that you want to get a dog, you should source it
responsibly.

You should consider adopting a dog from a local authority dog shelter or an
animal welfare charity.

You can also contact a vet to get advice on where to get one.

You should research different breeders, if you are going to buy a dog from a
dog breeder. Reputable breeders, may have a waiting list. The Irish Kennel
Club has information about how to find a reputable breeder when [ buying a
puppy ](https://www.ikc.ie/dog-ownership/choosing-the-right-dog/how-to-buy-a-
puppy/#:~:text=Show%20Secretaries%20listed.-,Research%20Your%20Breeder,-One%20of%20the)
.

You can also buy a dog from a Dog Breeding Establishment (DBE). Gov.ie have a
[ list of registered DBEs (pdf)
](https://assets.gov.ie/273145/64894e16-3b52-43ba-aed4-e4a6d3e71311.pdf) , or
you can check your local authority’s website. A registered DBE will have a
registration certificate on display in the premise.

You should never agree to collect a dog without seeing the dog in its home
environment first. A reputable breeder should also be able to show you the
dog’s mother. The ISPCA has useful information about [ what to do when buying
a puppy
](https://www.ispca.ie/news/detail/thinking_of_getting_a_new_puppy_here_is_what_you_need_to_know)
.

###  **Dog ownership and the law**

Local authorities are responsible for the control of dogs under the [ Control
of Dogs Act 1986
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1986/act/32/enacted/en/html) . They can:

  * Appoint dog wardens 
  * Provide dog shelters 
  * Seize dogs 
  * Impose on-the-spot fines 
  * Take court proceedings against dog owners 

You can be banned from keeping a dog if you have been convicted of cruelty to
a dog under the [ Protection of Animals Acts 1911 and 1965
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1965/act/10/enacted/en/html) .

##  Dog licences and dog control

###  Do I have to get a licence for my dog?

If your dog is over 4 months old, you must have a dog licence. Puppies under 4
months who are still with their mothers don't need a licence, but once they
leave their mothers, they must have a licence.

There are 3 types of dog licence:

  1. An individual dog licence, which costs €20 and is valid for 1 dog for 1 year 
  2. A 'lifetime of dog' licence, which costs €140 and is valid for your dog’s lifetime 
  3. A general dog licence, which costs €400 and is valid for 1 year. This covers multiple dogs at one location. 

You can apply for an individual or lifetime dog licence at your local [ post
office ](https://www.anpost.com/Government-Services/Dog-Licence) or online at
[ licences.ie ](https://www.licences.ie/ILAS/Home/Licences?bundleId=17) . A
general dog licence application must be sent to your [ local authority
](https://www.housingagency.ie/find-my-local-authority) .

Licences are **not** needed for:

  * Guide dogs for blind people 
  * Dogs that are being held by a local authority 
  * Dogs that are with the ISPCA or Gardaí 
  * Any dog imported into the State for less than 30 days 

###  Do I have to get my dog microchipped?

A microchip is a tiny electronic device injected by a vet under the skin of
the dog. The microchip is coded with a unique number for each dog. It can be
scanned to find out who owns the dog. Microchips can be scanned by the vets,
animal rescue organisations and the animal welfare unit in a local authority.
[ Read more about microchips for dogs ](https://www.dogstrust.ie/help-
advice/microchipping/microchipping-faq-page) .

You [ must get your dog microchipped by a vet
](https://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2015/si/63/made/en/print) and registered
under your name on an authorised database before they are 12 weeks old. This
also applies if a dog leaves the property where they were born before they are
12 weeks old.

Getting your dog microchipped costs approximately €25. However, some
organisations will do this for free or at a lower price, for example, the
DSPCA mobile vet clinic.

###  Does my dog have to wear a collar?

A dog must always wear a collar or a harness. It must have the name and
address of the owner on it. If your dog doesn’t have this identification, a
dog warden can give you can an [ on-the-spot fine
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/environment/pets-and-wildlife/control-
of-dogs/#ed14e2) . If you don’t pay this fine within the specified time-frame,
you can be prosecuted by the local authority.

###  What powers does a dog warden have?

Dog wardens can:

  * Request the name and address of anyone suspected of an offence under the Control of Dogs Act 
  * Seize and detain any dog 
  * Enter any premises to seize and detain a dog, apart from your home 

You can be arrested by a Garda if you:

  * Obstruct a dog warden in the course of their work 
  * Refuse to give your name and address to a dog warden 
  * Give a false name and address to a dog warden 

A dog warden can ask you for evidence of your dog licence and if you can’t
provide this, they can issue an on-the-spot fine.

##  Nuisance barking, dog fouling and stray dogs

###  My neighbour's dog won't stop barking. What can I do?

If your neighbour’s dog won’t stop barking, you should talk to your neighbour
first. If you can't resolve the issue with them, you can make a complaint to
the District Court and look for a hearing. When you get a court date, you must
notify the dog owner using a [ court form (docx)
](https://www.courts.ie/acc/alfresco/eb9b13cb-37ea-4fa3-82e3-9ca378b2c360/Order%20in%20relation%20to%20excessive%20barking%20by%20a%20dog%20-%20Control%20of%20Dogs%20Act%201986%20No.%2091.3.docx/docx/1)
, which is available from your local authority or the District Court.

Find out more about noise complaints about noisy dogs on our page ‘ [ Noise
pollution and noise complaints’
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/environment/environment-and-the-
law/noise-regulations/#cff4b2) **.**

You can find information and dog training about how to stop your dog barking
from the [ Dogs Trust ](https://supportus.dogstrust.ie/dog-school/book-here/)
and the [ DSCPA ](https://www.dspcadogtraining.ie/) .

###  Dog fouling

If your dog poos in a public place, you, or the person in charge of the dog,
must remove the poo and dispose of it in a proper and clean way. Otherwise, it
is an [ offence.
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1997/act/12/section/22/enacted/en/html#zza12y1997s22)

If your dog poos in a public place and you don’t pick it up, you can get a
€150 [ on-the-spot fine
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/environment/pets-and-wildlife/control-
of-dogs/#ed14e2) .

###  Stray and lost dogs

Stray dogs are dogs that are in a public place and are not with their owner or
a responsible person who is looking after them.

You can get an on-the-spot fine if your dog is not under proper control. Stray
dogs can be seized by the dog warden or Gardaí and brought to a dog pound.
These dogs may be put down or re-homed if their owners do not claim them
within 5 days.

If your dog is lost, has strayed or is missing, you should [ contact your
local dog warden ](https://www.ispca.ie/useful-info/dog-warden-info/) to check
if your dog is in the local shelter or dog pound. Before you collect it, you
may have to pay a re-claim fee and produce a current dog licence.

If you have [ found a lost dog you can report it
](https://www.ispca.ie/report_found_animal) to the Irish Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ISPCA) who will be able to help.

###  Unwanted dogs

If you have a dog that you no longer want, you should contact the [ ISPCA
](https://www.ispca.ie/) . They may be able to find it a new home. Dog
charities or pounds may also accept unwanted dogs, although you may be charged
for this. Local authorities can accept unwanted dogs and put them down if they
cannot be rehomed or transferred to an animal welfare group.

##  Restricted breeds of dog in Ireland
