#  Regulating energy and water for a changing climate

The Commission for Regulation of Utilities (CRU) is Ireland’s independent
energy and water regulator.

##  Smart Meters

By the end of 2025, every home and business in Ireland will have a smart
meter. Smart meters will give you more information on your electricity use and
other useful benefits.

###  Security of Supply

The CRU is working on a programme of actions to ensure Ireland has a stable
and resilient supply of energy. As Ireland moves to a low-carbon economy, the
transition will bring new challenges to ensure security of supply.
