#  Access to children after relationship breakdown

  * Introduction 
  * Access arrangements for children following relationship breakdown 
  * The role of the courts 
  * Who can apply to the courts for access? 
  * How to apply for access 
  * Enforcement order 
  * Legal advice 
  * Further information and support 

##  Introduction

The breakdown of a relationship is a difficult and traumatic process. There
are many issues to be worked out such as financial support, the family home,
guardianship, and the access and custody of children.

  * **Access** is the legal right of a child and an adult to have contact with one another when they no longer live together. 
  * **Custody** is the day-to-day care and home life of a dependent child under the age of 18. 
  * **Guardianship** is a person's legal responsibility to make decisions and perform duties regarding a child's upbringing. 

##  Access arrangements for children following relationship breakdown

Where you and your ex-partner agree, it is possible to put shared access
arrangements in place for your child. You can reach agreement about access
arrangements together yourselves, or with the [ help of a mediator or a
solicitor ](https://services.courts.ie/Family-Law/getting-help) . Your
agreement may include cooperation on practical day-to-day and special
arrangements such as:

  * Meeting the child in person on agreed days and times 
  * Meeting the child in person for a social event or special event, like a birthday 
  * Communicating by phone or other electronic means 
  * Having the child stay overnight either occasionally, on alternate weekends or during school holidays 
  * Going on holidays with the child 

##  The role of the courts

When the parents of a child separate and they cannot agree on access rights,
the courts will decide. The welfare of the child will be the most important
factor.

In general, the courts consider that it is very important for the welfare of a
child that it should have a relationship with both of their parents, and they
are very slow to deny access rights to the natural parent of a child.

Where the child's age and level of understanding are appropriate, the voice of
the child can be taken into consideration as part of any court decisions.

##  Who can apply to the courts for access?

  * A parent of the child 
  * Certain relatives of the child such as brothers, sisters, aunts, uncles, and grandparents 
  * A guardian of the child 
  * Any other adult who the child lives with, or lived with previously 

A father may apply for access whether or not he is a [ guardian ](/en/birth-
family-relationships/cohabiting-couples/guardianship-and-cohabiting-couples/)
. He can do this even if his name is not on the child's birth certificate, and
even where his application for joint guardianship has been turned down.

If both guardianship and access are being applied for, then separate
applications must be made, but both applications will be heard by the court at
the same time.

The Courts Service has an ' [ Eligibility Checker
](https://services.courts.ie/Family-Law/arrangements-for-
children/access/access-rights) ' tool you can use to see whether you are
eligible to apply for access.

##  How to apply for access

Most applications for guardianship, custody and access are made in the
District Court. In some situations, relating to more complex cases, an
application can be made in the Circuit Court or the High Court. Each court has
its own rules on how to apply for a court order.

If you are making an application for access, you can apply to the District
Court office in the area you or the respondent is working or living in.

The [ Courts Service ](https://services.courts.ie/Family-Law/arrangements-for-
children/access) explains the steps involved in making an application to a
District Court office:

  1. [ Consider mediation and legal advice ](https://services.courts.ie/Family-Law/arrangements-for-children/how-to-apply-for-guardianship-custody-or-access/how-to-apply-for-guardianship-custody-or-access-outside-dcfl/step-1-consider-mediation-and-legal-advice)
  2. [ Decide where to make your application ](https://services.courts.ie/Family-Law/arrangements-for-children/how-to-apply-for-guardianship-custody-or-access/how-to-apply-for-guardianship-custody-or-access-outside-dcfl/step-2-decide-where-to-make-your-application)
  3. [ Download and complete paperwork. ](https://services.courts.ie/Family-Law/arrangements-for-children/how-to-apply-for-guardianship-custody-or-access/how-to-apply-for-guardianship-custody-or-access-outside-dcfl/step-3-download-and-complete-paperwork) If you cannot download a form, you can request it from your local Court office. 
  4. [ Serve the documents and provide proof of service. ](https://services.courts.ie/Family-Law/arrangements-for-children/how-to-apply-for-guardianship-custody-or-access/how-to-apply-for-guardianship-custody-or-access-outside-dcfl/step-5-serve-the-documents-and-provide-proof-of-service) You must send a copy of the application to all parties. 
  5. [ Lodge documents in the court office ](https://services.courts.ie/Family-Law/arrangements-for-children/how-to-apply-for-guardianship-custody-or-access/how-to-apply-for-guardianship-custody-or-access-outside-dcfl/step-6-lodge-documents-with-court-office)
  6. [ Attend court hearing ](https://services.courts.ie/Family-Law/arrangements-for-children/how-to-apply-for-guardianship-custody-or-access/how-to-apply-for-guardianship-custody-or-access-outside-dcfl/step-8-receive-a-court-order)

If either of you live or work in Dublin, your local office may be the Dublin
District Court Family Law Office, also known as Dolphin House. The application
process for people [ making an application in Dolphin House
](https://services.courts.ie/Family-Law/arrangements-for-children/how-to-
apply-for-guardianship-custody-or-access/how-to-apply-for-guardianship-
custody-or-access-in-dcfl/step-2-book-appointment-at-dolphin-house) is
different to the process for the rest of the country.

###  Preparing for court

You can find information to help you to [ prepare for attending a family law
court ](https://services.courts.ie/Family-Law/preparing-for-family-law-
court/how-to-prepare-for-a-court-hearing) . Family law cases are heard in
camera. This means they are heard in private to protect the privacy of the
family. It does not mean they are filmed or videoed.

It also can be helpful to know:

  * [ Things you will need to do on the day of your hearing ](https://services.courts.ie/Family-Law/preparing-for-family-law-court/what-to-do-on-the-day)
  * [ What happens in the court room ](https://services.courts.ie/Family-Law/preparing-for-family-law-court/what-happens-in-the-courtroom)
  * [ Who to expect inside the court room ](https://services.courts.ie/Family-Law/preparing-for-family-law-court/who-to-expect-inside-the-courtroom)
  * [ What happens when your hearing ends ](https://services.courts.ie/Family-Law/preparing-for-family-law-court/what-happens-when-a-hearing-ends)

You have [ the right to appeal ](https://services.courts.ie/Family-
Law/appealing-a-court-decision/appealing-a-district-court-order) if you are
not happy with the decision of the judge. If you wish to appeal the decision,
you must file your appeal documents within the relevant timelines for each
court. For instance, if you want to appeal a District Court decision or order,
you must file your appeal documents within 14 days of the court hearing.

##  Enforcement order

The court can impose an enforcement order if you have been unreasonably denied
the access the court granted you. This may include:

  * You getting compensatory or additional time with the child 
  * Your expenses being reimbursed as a result of the refusal to allow the access 
  * One or both of you attending parenting programmes, family counselling or receiving information on mediation 

##  Legal advice

It is always advisable to get legal advice and representation, however, you
are entitled to represent yourself. The Law Society has a [ directory of
solicitors' firms ](http://www.lawsociety.ie/Pages/Find-a-Firm/) which you can
search for a solicitor in your area.

To enquire whether you are [ eligible for legal aid
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/justice/legal-aid-and-advice/civil-
legal-advice-and-legal-aid/) , [ contact your nearest law centre
](http://www.legalaidboard.ie/lab/publishing.nsf/Content/Law_Centres) . Legal
aid is generally not free and most recipients must pay a contribution towards
costs. You can download [ an application form for Legal Services (pdf)
](http://www.legalaidboard.ie/en/Our-Services/Legal-Aid-Services/Application-
For-Legal-Services-Form-October-2014.pdf) or you can [ apply for civil legal
aid or advice online ](https://www.legalaidboard.ie/en/our-services/legal-aid-
services/apply-for-legal-aid-online/) . If you cannot afford to pay the
contribution, you can [ apply to the Legal Aid Board to have it waived
](https://legalaidboard.ie/en/our-services/legal-aid-services/apply-for-a-
waiver-of-contribution/) .

services/family-mediation/) can help couples who have decided to separate to
negotiate their own terms of agreement, while addressing the needs and
interests of all involved. The service is free. Read more about [ family
