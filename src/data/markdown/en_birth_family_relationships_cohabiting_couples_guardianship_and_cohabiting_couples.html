##  Introduction

If you are a guardian of a child in Ireland, you have a legal responsibility
to maintain and properly care for the child. You also have the right to make
decisions about the child's religious upbringing, their education, consent to
medical treatment and their general welfare.

You can apply for guardianship up until a child reaches 18 years of age.
Guardianship ends when a child turns 18 unless a guardian dies or is removed
before that.

Guardianship can be:

  * Automatic guardianship 
  * Guardianship by agreement 
  * Testamentary guardianship 
  * Guardianship decided by the court 

The rights of parents to guardianship are set out in Section 6 of the [
Guardianship of Infants Act, 1964
](https://revisedacts.lawreform.ie/eli/1964/act/7/front/revised/en/html) .

##  Automatic guardianship

Married parents of a child, including an adopted child, have automatic
guardianship of their children. This means they do not have to apply to court
for guardianship. They are joint guardians. This applies whether the couple
marry before or after the child's birth. Separation or divorce does not change
this automatic right.

If the biological parents of a child marry each other after the birth, then
the father automatically becomes a joint guardian of the child. There is,
therefore, no need to apply for guardianship rights nor is there any need for
the father to adopt the child.

For children born to parents that are not married to each other, only the
mother has an automatic right to guardianship. Even if a father's name is
registered on the child's birth certificate, this does not give him any
guardianship rights in respect of the child.

However, an unmarried parent will automatically be a guardian if they have
lived with the child's mother for 12 months in a row, including at least 3
months with the mother and child following the child's birth.

##  Guardianship by agreement

If the mother agrees, the father can become a joint guardian if both parents
sign a _statutory declaration_ . The [ statutory declaration (SI 210 of 2020)
(pdf) ](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2020/si/210/made/en/pdf) must be
signed in the presence of a [ Notary Public
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/justice/civil-law/notaries-public/) ,
[ Peace Commissioner ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/justice/civil-
law/peace-commissioners/) or a [ Commissioner for Oaths
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/justice/civil-law/commissioners-for-
oaths/) or a registrar of a [ civil registration service
](https://www2.hse.ie/services/births-deaths-and-marriages/contact-a-civil-
registration-service.html) .

This declaration states the names of the parents of the child, that they are
unmarried and that they agree that the father should be appointed as a joint
guardian. If there is more than one child, a separate statutory declaration
form should be completed for every child.

SI 210 of 2020 also provides a [ statutory declaration form (pdf)
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2020/si/210/made/en/pdf) for a mother and
second parent to become joint guardians by agreement of a child born as a
result of a donor-assisted human reproduction procedure.

##  Testamentary guardianship

A guardian of a child (especially if you are a sole guardian) should make a
will, appointing a testamentary guardian to act on your behalf in the event of
your death. It is strongly advised that you talk this over with someone who
could act as guardian and that they give their consent to being named in your
will as testamentary guardian.

The child's surviving guardian (if there is one) will then act jointly with
the new guardian. A surviving guardian can apply to have the appointment of a
testamentary guardian revoked. Read more in our document about [ making a will
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/death/before-a-death/making-a-will/) .

##  Guardianship decided by the courts

The father has automatic joint guardianship if he has lived with the child's
mother for 12 consecutive months including at least 3 months with the mother
and child following the child's birth. If the mother disputes the amount of
time spent cohabiting or does not agree to sign the statutory declaration, the
other parent must apply to the court to be appointed as a joint guardian. You
do not require legal representation to do this, you can make the application
on your own behalf. Most court applications are made to the [ District Court
](/en/justice/courts-system/district-court/) . They can also be made to the [
Circuit Court ](/en/justice/courts-system/circuit-court/) as part of an
application for [ judicial separation ](/en/birth-family-
relationships/separation-and-divorce/judicial-separation/) or [ divorce
](/en/birth-family-relationships/separation-and-divorce/divorce-decrees/) .

Even if the mother does not consent to the guardianship application, it does
not automatically mean that the court will refuse the order sought by the
other parent. The court will decide what is in the best interest of the child
and the parents.

###  Legal guardianship applications after changes in relationship status of
the parents

Where a parent is joint guardian and then subsequently marries or becomes a
qualified cohabitant, the other guardian will remain the joint guardian of the
child.

It is possible though for the step-parent or a person who has lived with the
parent for a minimum of 3 years (qualified cohabitant) to apply to court to
become a guardian. To do this, the step-parent or qualified cohabitant must
have shared the parental responsibility for the day-to-day care of the child
with the parent they live with for at least 2 years

If a child has no parent or guardian who is willing or able to exercise the
rights and responsibilities of a guardian, someone who has provided for the
child’s day-to-day care for a continuous period of more than 1 year may also
apply for guardianship, for example, a foster parent.

An application for guardianship must be notified to all other parents or
guardians of the child, although the decision will not affect that parent or
guardian’s existing rights in relation to the child. In deciding whether or
not to allow the guardianship application, the court will consider how much
any other guardians are involved in the child’s upbringing, and any views of
child or children involved. If guardianship is granted, the new guardian’s
rights will be set out in the court’s order. These may not be as extensive as
the rights of the other guardians.

Alternatively, the parent and their new spouse/partner/qualified cohabitant
may wish to adopt the child. To do this, they must seek consent from the
child's other guardian. If the child's other guardian consents to the
adoption, then he or she gives up the right to guardianship and parentage of
the child.

###  Temporary guardianship

Temporary guardianship can be given to allow another adult, known as the
nominated person, to care for your child or children if you become seriously
unwell or need be hospitalised. The nominated person must be a suitable person
over 18 years old.

You need to complete a [ special form to nominate a temporary guardian (pdf)
](https://www.treoir.ie/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/nomination-form.pdf) , in
which you can set out your wishes on any limitations on the temporary
guardian. The nominated person must then apply to the court if you cannot
carry out your parental role due to serious illness. Exactly what the
temporary guardian’s rights are will be set out in the District Court’s Order,
which will usually be identical to the wishes you set out in the form.

If the court appoints a guardian to a child where one or both parents are
alive, the guardian will not generally have the right to make certain major
decisions about the child unless that right is expressly granted by the court.

##  Removal of guardianship rights

Fathers and others who have been appointed joint guardians by a court or by
statutory declaration can be removed from their position if the court is
satisfied it is in the child's best interest. The only way a mother can give
up her guardianship rights in Ireland, is if the child is placed for adoption.

child. Staff in your local District Court will provide you with assistance to
help guide you through the process.
