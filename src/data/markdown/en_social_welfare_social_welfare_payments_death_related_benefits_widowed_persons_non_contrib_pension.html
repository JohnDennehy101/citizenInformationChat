##  Introduction

A Widow's, Widower's or Surviving Civil Partner’s (Non-Contributory) Pension
is a means-tested payment payable to a widow, widower or surviving [ civil
partner ](/en/birth-family-relationships/civil-partnerships/civil-
partnerships/) who does not qualify for a contributory widow's, widower's or
surviving civil partner’s payment. (This payment was formerly called the
Widow's/Widower's (Non-Contributory) Pension).

It is a payment for widows, widowers or surviving civil partners who **do not
have dependent children** . People with dependent children should apply for
the [ One-Parent Family Payment ](/en/social-welfare/families-and-
children/one-parent-family-payment/) or [ Jobseeker's Transitional payment
](/en/social-welfare/unemployed-people/jobseekers-transitional-payment/) .

Widow's, Widower's or Surviving Civil Partner’s (Non-Contributory) Pension is
not paid to people aged 66 and over, but you can apply for a [ State Pension
(Non-Contributory) ](/en/social-welfare/older-and-retired-people/state-
pension-non-contributory/) .

##  Rules

To qualify you must, of course, be a widow, widower or surviving civil partner
and you must not be cohabiting with another person. You can keep your
entitlement to this pension if you are divorced or your civil partnership has
been dissolved, and you would have been entitled to this pension had you
remained married or in the civil partnership.

You must also:

  * Pass a [ means test ](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/means-test-for-social-welfare-payments/means-test/) and 
  * Be [ habitually resident ](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/social-assistance-payments/habitual-residence-condition/) in the State. 

###  The means test

Your means are any income you have or property (except your own home) or an
asset that could bring in money or provide you with an income.

Your means are assessed using specific rules under the following headings:

  * Cash income (including, income from work) 
  * Value of capital (for example, savings, investments, cash on hand and property but not your own home) 
  * Income from property personally used 

###  Cash income and income from work

Any cash income you have is assessed in the means test. This includes income
from a social security pension from another country. However, certain items of
cash income are not taken into account in the means test. For example,
earnings of up to €100 per week from employment (but not self-employment) are
not taken into account. Any income from work above €100 is assessed as means.

More information is available in our document about [ cash income not taken
into account in the means test ](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-
system/means-test-for-social-welfare-payments/cash-income-not-included-in-the-
social-welfare-means-test/) .

Any income you get from working as a home help for the HSE is taken into
account in the means test.

###  Capital and property not personally used

Savings, investments, cash on hand and any property you own (but not your own
home) is assessed as capital. All your capital from different sources is added
together and a special formula is then used to find your weekly means from
capital.

The property and investments that may be assessed under this heading include
savings in a bank account (or anywhere else), a house that you have let, and
stocks and shares. You may or may not be getting an income from the property
or investment. Income from property already assessed on its capital value is
not assessed in the means test - see 'Cash income' above.

More information is available in our document on [ how capital and property is
assessed as means ](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/means-test-
for-social-welfare-payments/how-to-assess-your-means-from-capital-for-social-
welfare-payments/) .

###  Income from your home (such as rent)

The value of the house you live in is not taken into account in the means
test. Income you are getting from your home (for example renting a room) can
be taken into account. However, the following exceptions apply:

  * You are living alone: If renting out the room means that you would not be living alone, then your income from rent is not taken into account. 
  * You are **not** living alone: You can get up to [ €269.23 a week (€14,000 per year) from renting a room in your home ](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/means-test-for-social-welfare-payments/means-test/) without it affecting your Widow's, Widower's or Surviving Civil Partner’s (Non-Contributory) Pension. The person renting a room in your home must use the room for a minimum of 28 consecutive days and not be an employee or immediate family member. 

You should check if renting a room in your home will affect your [ Fuel
Allowance ](/en/social-welfare/extra-social-welfare-benefits/fuel-allowance/)
.

The [ Accommodation Recognition Payment ](/en/moving-country/ukrainian-
refugees-in-ireland/accommodation-recognition-payment/) for hosting refugees
from Ukraine is not assessed in the means test for the Widow's, Widower's or
Surviving Civil Partner’s (Non-Contributory) Pension.

###  Total means

Your means under the various headings are added together to see what level of
pension, if any, you can get.

The first €7.60 per week of means as assessed by the Department of Social
Protection does not affect the rate of pension. After that, [ the pension is
reduced by €2.50 each week for every €2.50 of means
](https://www.gov.ie/en/service/269fa9-widows-widowers-or-surviving-civil-
partners-non-contributory-pension/) .

welfare-payment/) while you are getting a Widow's, Widower's or Surviving

change, you may no longer qualify for the payment or it may be reduced. This

overpayments/) .
