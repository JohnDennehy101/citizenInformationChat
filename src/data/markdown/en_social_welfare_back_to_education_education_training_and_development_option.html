#  Education, Training and Development Option

  * Introduction 
  * Rules 
  * Rates 
  * How to apply 
  * Where to apply 

##  Introduction

Under the Education, Training and Development Option you may continue to get
your [ Jobseeker’s Allowance ](/en/social-welfare/unemployed-
people/jobseekers-allowance/) or [ Jobseeker’s Benefit ](/en/social-
welfare/unemployed-people/jobseekers-benefit/) while attending certain short
courses of education, training or development. Your Intreo Centre may make
special signing-on arrangements so that you can attend your chosen course.

###  Appeals

The Education, Training and Development Option is an administrative scheme.
This means you cannot [ appeal a refusal ](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-
welfare-system/social-welfare-appeals/) to the [ Social Welfare Appeals Office
](http://www.socialwelfareappeals.ie/) . However, you can seek a review of a
decision. This will be made by an officer of the Department of Social
Protection (DSP) not involved in the decision being reviewed or by a more
senior officer. The review will look at whether the guidelines were applied
correctly and that the correct processes were followed.

##  Rules

To qualify for the Education, Training and Development Option and keep your
Jobseeker’s Allowance or Jobseeker's Benefit you must be:

  * At least 21 years of age **or**
  * Between 18 and 20 and out of the formal education system for at least 2 years 

**And**

  * Have been getting Jobseeker's Allowance, Jobseeker's Benefit or [ signing on for unemployment credits ](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/social-insurance-prsi/credited-social-insurance-contributions/) for at least 6 months (156 days). 

###  Courses covered

The Education, Training and Development Option allows you to attend short
courses , typically no longer than 10 weeks. For example, courses may be one-
day courses, half-day courses for a number of weeks or evening courses. You
must be able to show that the course chosen will improve your chances of
getting a job. Courses you can take part in include:

  * Personal development courses 
  * General training courses 
  * Specific job skills courses 
  * Evening courses 

The course must be approved by a Case Officer and should form part of your DSP
Personal Progression Plan. You can arrange an appointment with a Case Officer
by contacting your Intreo Centre- see 'Where to apply' below.

###  Finding a course

To find out about available courses and get advice on how to get a place on
the course of your choice, you should contact [ your local ETB,
](http://www.etbi.ie/etbs/directory-of-etbs/) school or college, public
library or [ Citizens Information Service
](http://centres.citizensinformation.ie/) .

##  Rates

You will continue to get your weekly Jobseeker’s Allowance or Jobseeker’s
Benefit at your usual rate and any other secondary benefits.

Secondary benefits may include:

  * [ Fuel Allowance ](/en/social-welfare/extra-social-welfare-benefits/fuel-allowance/)
  * [ Rent Supplement ](/en/social-welfare/supplementary-welfare-schemes/rent-supplement/) . However, out of pocket expenses, may affect the amount of Rent Supplement you are getting. 

###  Signing for unemployment credits

If you have been signing on for unemployment credits, you will continue to get
credits while you are participating in the Education, Training and Development
Option.

##  How to apply

All applications for the [ Back to Education - Education, Training and
Development Option should be made on form BTE1(pdf)
](http://www.welfare.ie/en/pdf/bte1.pdf) . You will be asked to provide
information about your course, for example:

  * The course time-table 
  * Written confirmation from the relevant organisation or school that you have registered for the course 
  * You may be asked for confirmation of on-going course attendance 
  * You are also required to notify the Department when you finish the course. 

##  Where to apply

Apply for the Education, Training and Development Option at your [ Intreo
Centre or Social Welfare Branch Office

Offices.aspx) .
