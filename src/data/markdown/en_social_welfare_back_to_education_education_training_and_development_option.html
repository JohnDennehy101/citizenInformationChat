special signing-on arrangements so that you can attend your chosen course.

###  Appeals

The Education, Training and Development Option is an administrative scheme.
This means you cannot [ appeal a refusal ](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-
welfare-system/social-welfare-appeals/) to the [ Social Welfare Appeals Office
](http://www.socialwelfareappeals.ie/) . However, you can seek a review of a
decision. This will be made by an officer of the Department of Social
Protection (DSP) not involved in the decision being reviewed or by a more
senior officer. The review will look at whether the guidelines were applied
correctly and that the correct processes were followed.
