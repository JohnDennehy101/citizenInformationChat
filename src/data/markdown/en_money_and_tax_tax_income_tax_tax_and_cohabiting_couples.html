#  Taxation of cohabiting couples

  * Introduction 
  * How cohabiting couples are taxed 
  * Tax reliefs for former cohabitants 

##  Introduction

You are cohabiting if you are living with someone in a committed relationship
but you are not married or in a civil partnership.

[ Cohabiting couples (cohabitants) do not have the same legal rights and
obligations as married couples or civil partners ](/en/birth-family-
relationships/cohabiting-couples/legal-differences-between-cohabitation-and-
marriage/) .

You can read more about [ the legal rights of cohabiting couples ](/en/birth-
family-relationships/cohabiting-couples/) .

##  How cohabiting couples are taxed

Cohabiting couples are not taxed the same as married couples or civil
partners. In general, they are taxed as single individuals.

###  Income tax

Married couples can share their tax reliefs and allowances between them.
Cohabiting couples are taxed as single individuals.

[ Read about how your income tax is calculated ](/en/money-and-tax/tax/income-
tax/how-your-tax-is-calculated/) .

###  Capital Acquisition Tax

[ Capital Acquisitions Tax ](/en/money-and-tax/tax/capital-taxes/capital-
acquisitions-tax/) (CAT) is a tax on gifts or inheritances. Transfers between
spouses and civil partners are exempt from CAT.

If you get a gift or inheritance from a relative, it is tax free up to a
certain amount depending on the relationship.

If you get a gift or inheritance from your cohabitant, it is taxed in the same
way as if it was from someone who is not related to you. The lowest tax-free
threshold applies.

If your cohabiting partner dies when you are still in a relationship together,
you may be able to apply to court for a portion of their estate. A gift or
inheritance is exempt from CAT if it is made by court order in this way under
the [ redress scheme for cohabiting couples
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/birth-family-relationships/cohabiting-
couples/legal-differences-between-cohabitation-and-marriage/#l87f4e) .

##  Tax reliefs for former cohabitants

If your cohabiting relationship ends, you may be entitled to tax relief if a
court orders:

  * You to make maintenance payments to your former partner 
  * A transfer of assets between you 

To be a qualifying cohabitant for these reliefs you must have been cohabiting
for at least:

  * 5 years or 
  * 2 years if you are the parents of a dependent child 

###  Maintenance payments

If you make legally enforceable maintenance payments to benefit your former
partner, you can deduct them from your income to reduce the tax you pay.

Read more about [ how maintenance payments are taxed ](/en/money-and-
tax/tax/income-tax-credits-and-reliefs/maintenance-and-tax/) .

###  Property transfers

If a court orders your former cohabitant to transfer property to you, you do
not have to pay [ Capital Acquisitions Tax ](/en/money-and-tax/tax/capital-
taxes/capital-acquisitions-tax/) or [ stamp duty
](https://www.revenue.ie/en/property/stamp-duty/index.aspx) .

If a court orders you to transfer an asset to your former cohabitant, you do
not have to pay [ Capital Gains Tax ](/en/money-and-tax/tax/capital-
taxes/capital-gains-tax/) or stamp duty.
