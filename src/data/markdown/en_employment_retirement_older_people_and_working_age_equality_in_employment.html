##  Introduction

It is against the law to discriminate against anyone in employment based on
their age. This is set out in the [ Employment Equality Acts 1998-2015
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1998/en/act/pub/0021/index.html) , which
covers discrimination in the workplace.

The law on discrimination only applies to people aged 16 and over. However,
there are some exceptions to this. [ You can read more about the rights of
young workers ](/en/employment/starting-work-and-changing-job/young-people-at-
work/rights-of-young-workers/) .

The law on young workers is set out in the [ Protection of Young Persons
(Employment) Act 1996
](https://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1996/act/16/enacted/en/html) .

##  What is discrimination?

Discrimination is when an employer treats you less favourably to another
employee or job candidate on any of the nine protected grounds specified
below. This is known as **direct discrimination** .

As an employee, you are protected against discrimination under the following
grounds (reasons):

  * Gender 
  * Civil status 
  * Family status 
  * Sexual orientation 
  * Religion 
  * Age 
  * Disability 
  * Race 
  * Membership of the Traveller community 

This is outlined in the Employment Equality Acts 1998-2015.

##  Types of discrimination

In addition to **direct discrimination** , there are several other types of
discrimination. The [ Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission has examples
](https://www.ihrec.ie/guides-and-tools/human-rights-and-equality-for-
employers/what-does-the-law-say/discrimination-under-the-employment-equality-
acts/) of these.

###  Indirect discrimination

This is when practices or policies do not appear to discriminate against one
group more than another, but actually have a discriminatory impact. This can
also happen where a requirement that may appear non-discriminatory negatively
affects a particular group or class of people.

###  Discrimination by association

This happens when a person is treated less favourably because they are
associated with or connected to another person who comes under one or more of
the nine grounds.

###  Discrimination by imputation

This is discrimination against a person because they are incorrectly assumed
(imputed) to be a member of one of the protected groups.

###  Prohibited discrimination

This relates to:

  * Equal pay 
  * Access to employment 
  * Conditions of employment (excluding pensions) 
  * Training or experience 
  * Promotion or regrading or classification of job positions 

##  Where might you encounter discrimination?

You may experience discrimination from different groups and organisations. The
law bans discrimination by:

  * Employers 
  * Employment agencies 
  * Providers of vocational training 
  * [ Trade unions ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/employment/employment-rights-and-conditions/industrial-relations-and-trade-unions/trade-unions/)
  * Employer organisations 
  * Professional bodies 
  * Trade associations 

Discrimination in job advertisements is also banned.

##  When is it not considered discrimination?

There are certain situations where an employer may have to set age
restrictions in work.

An employer can:

  * Set a minimum age requirement (up to 18 years) when recruiting 
  * Set a maximum recruitment age where it would not be worthwhile financially for an older person to apply for the job. For example, where training is involved and there is not enough time for the employer to make back the costs of the training before the person retires 
  * Offer a fixed-term contract to a person over the compulsory retirement age once it is objectively justified 

For an occupational benefits scheme (also known as company or employersâ€™
pensions), an employer is allowed to treat employees different on the age
ground in certain circumstances.

The Pensions Authority has detailed guidance and examples of [ equal pension
treatment (pdf)
](https://www.pensionsauthority.ie/en/employers/checklists_and_guides/a_brief_guide_to_equal_pension_treatment3.pdf)
. Section 6.7 covers the age ground and allowed exceptions.

###  Positive action

Positive action is where an employer takes specific steps to improve equality
in a workplace by employing a person from an underrepresented group.

The law also allows for positive action on a number of grounds including age.
For example, a company could use positive action statement in recruitment ads
to say they welcome applications from people over a certain age.

##  If you think you've been discriminated against

If you feel that you have been discriminated against on the grounds of age,
there are several steps you can follow.

  1. Talk to your employer to try and resolve the problem. 
  2. If this doesnâ€™t work, make a complaint to the WRC using the [ online complaint form ](https://www.workplacerelations.ie/en/Complaints_Disputes/Refer_a_Dispute_Make_a_Complaint/) . You must make your complaint **within 6 months** of the last act of discrimination. The time limit can be extended by a further 6 months, but only if there is valid reason why you could not make the complaint sooner. 

You can read or download a free [ guide to taking an employment equality case
](https://communitylawandmediation.ie/publications/employment-equality-acts/)
from the Community Law and Mediation (CLM) website. CLM also offers [ free
legal information, advice and mediation services
](https://communitylawandmediation.ie/services/) .
