#  Judicial review in planning and environmental matters

  * Introduction 
  * Procedures in planning and environmental matters 
  * How to apply 
  * Costs 

##  Introduction

Public decisions made by administrative bodies and the lower courts, may be
judicially reviewed by the High Court. In a judicial review, the court is not
concerned with the merits of the decision but rather with the lawfulness of
the decision-making process, for example how the decision was made and the
fairness of it.

The basic principles of public decision-making are:

  * The decision-maker must have authority to make the decision that affects you. If the decision-maker has the authority to make the decision, it must not go beyond the limits of its authority 
  * You are entitled to fair procedures in how the decision is reached. This means that the decision-maker must not be biased and the decision-maker must give you a fair hearing. You must be given an adequate opportunity to present your case. You must be informed of the matter and you must be given a chance to comment on the material put forward by the other side. 
  * The decision maker must comply with all legal requirements governing the decision and its making. 

If the decision-maker does not have authority or does not give you fair
procedures or does not comply with the law, you may bring judicial review
proceedings in the High Court to challenge the decision. You must show that
you have an arguable case, that is, that your case has grounds. You must also
show that you have 'sufficient interest' in the proceedings, that is, that you
were affected in some way by the decision you are challenging. Non-
governmental organisations which have been promoting environmental protection
for 12 months in respect of relevant matters are not required to demonstrate a
sufficient interest.

The High Court will examine the decision and how it was reached and will
decide whether or not it was legal or unconstitutional. The High Court may
then quash or cancel the decision – by issuing an order known as 'certiorari'.
The High Court can also order a decision maker, who is obliged to make a
decision but has failed or refused to do so, to actually make the decision –
this is known as an order of 'mandamus'. An order of prohibition may also be
granted in appropriate circumstances – for example an order prohibiting a
decision maker from making a decision. Other orders that are available include
declarations, injunctions of an interim, interlocutory or permanent nature, or
an award of damages.

###  Conventional and statutory review

Judicial review is divided into two main categories:

  * **Judicial review in the ordinary or conventional sense:** This is the traditional type of judicial review developed over time by the judges and case law. The procedure governing conventional judicial review can be found in [ Order 84 of the Rules of the Superior Courts ](http://www.courts.ie/rules.nsf/8652fb610b0b37a980256db700399507/a53b0f76ffc6c5b780256d2b0046b3dc?OpenDocument) . Further information on the procedure is available in [ Judicial review of public decisions ](/en/government-in-ireland/how-government-works/standards-and-accountability/judicial-review-public-decisions/) . 
  * **Statutory judicial review:** Specialised statutory schemes of judicial review relating to specific areas of public decision-making which have been singled out by the Oireachtas as warranting specialised schemes because of the policy concerns involved. Statutory schemes and the procedure involved are covered by legislation specific to that area. Statutory schemes apply to such areas as asylum, pollution control, planning and the takeover of companies. 

Statutory judicial review schemes supplement Order 84 of the Rules of the
Superior Courts with their own specific procedural rules. These statutory
schemes narrow the availability of judicial review through such features as:

  * Time limits for an application for leave to bring judicial review proceedings are shorter 
  * Requirements to notify the decision-maker of the leave application 
  * Higher thresholds applied by the High Court when considering whether to allow leave, for example, substantial grounds rather than an arguable case 

##  Procedures in planning and environmental matters

###  Waste licensing

Decisions of the Environmental Protection Agency in relation to waste
licensing under the [ Waste Management Act 1996
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1996/en/act/pub/0010/index.html) and the [
Waste Management (Licensing) Regulations 2004 (SI 395/2004)
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2004/en/si/0395.html) are subject to
conventional judicial review in accordance with the provisions of Order 84 of
the Rules of the Superior Courts.

###  Planning and Development Act consents

A specific statutory procedure applies to applications for judicial review of
decisions made by the planning authorities or An Bord Pleanála. Sections 50
and 50A of the [ Planning and Development Act 2000
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2000/en/act/pub/0030/index.html) (as amended)
set out this procedure, which differs from that provided for in Order 84 of
the Rules of the Superior Courts. In particular the time limit for instituting
a judicial review in respect of a decision under the Planning and Development
Act is 8 weeks from the date of the decision or the doing of an act by a
planning authority or the Board. This time may be extended by the Court if it
is satisfied there is good and sufficient reason for doing so, and the
circumstances that resulted in the failure to make the application for leave
within the 8 weeks were outside the control of, the applicant for such
extension.

###  Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control licence applications

Applications for judicial review in respect of the Environmental Protection
Agency in relation to Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control (IPPC)
licence applications are regulated by statute. Section 87(10) of the [
Environmental Protection Agency Act 1992
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1992/en/act/pub/0007/index.html) (as amended)
provides for judicial review or other legal proceedings to be initiated by any
person, seeking to question the validity of a decision of the Agency to grant
or refuse a licence or a revised licence, within a period of 8 weeks. This
period may be extended, on application, by the High Court, where it considers
that there is good and sufficient reason for doing so. There is no requirement
on the person initiating these proceedings to demonstrate an interest or
indicate a potential personal impact or having a sufficient interest.

##  How to apply

If you wish to begin judicial review proceedings, you may want to contact a [
solicitor ](/en/justice/courtroom/solicitors/) who will in turn brief a [
barrister ](/en/justice/courtroom/barristers/) to draft the papers for the
case. It is also possible for you to represent yourself if you wish to keep
your legal costs down.

##  Costs

There is no fixed rate of charges for legal fees in Ireland. As with all other
service providers, it is advisable to obtain some quotes before deciding on
legal representation. Your solicitor must advise you in writing of the fees
you will be charged for their services. If it is not possible to give you a
definite sum, they must estimate a sum or at the very least describe the basis
upon which charges or fees will be calculated.

Generally in litigation the normal rule with regard to costs is that ‘costs
follow the event’, for example the successful party is generally entitled to
their costs. Of course if you lose that means that generally you become liable
for the costs of the winning party.

The Planning and Development Act as amended, by way of section 50B, provides
special rules in order to comply with the Public Participation Directive and
with the [ Aarhus Convention ](/en/environment/environment-and-the-law/aarhus-
convention/) . In cases involving the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA),
Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) and Integrated Pollution Prevention
and Control directives (IPPC), a member of the public seeking a review of a
public decision will generally not be liable for their costs if they lose and
may be entitled to their costs from the losing party if they win. An applicant
may also be awarded their costs in cases of exceptional importance and where
it is in the interests of justice. This was amended by [ Section 29
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2018/act/16/section/29/enacted/en/html#sec29)
of the [ Planning and Development (Amendment) Act, 2018
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2018/act/16/enacted/en/html) to apply the
Aarhus Convention special cost rules to judicial reviews of decisions, actions
or omissions made under national law implementing the appropriate assessment
provisions of the Habitats Directive.

There are, however, some exemptions to this rule and an order of costs may be
awarded against a party to proceedings in certain circumstances including:

  * Where a case is deemed to be vexatious or frivolous 
  * The manner in which a party has conducted the proceedings, or 
  * If a party is in contempt of court 

In the [ Environment (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2011
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2011/en/act/pub/0020/index.html) these rules
were extended to reviews of decisions in certain other environmental cases.

A list of the types of cases to which these rules apply is provided for at [
section 4
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2011/en/act/pub/0020/sec0004.html#sec4) of
the Environmental (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act. Section 4 was amended by the
Planning and Development (Amendment) Act, 2018. The rules arising under the
requirements of the Aarhus Convention (concerning legal costs) now also apply
to challenges of decisions, actions or omissions made under statutory
provisions giving effect to Article 6.3 and 6.4 of the 1992 EU Habitats
Directive relating to Appropriate Assessment.

[ Section 7
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2011/en/act/pub/0020/sec0007.html) of the
Environment (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2011 provides for a procedure where
a person can apply to a court, prior to taking proceedings, to determine if
the case in question qualifies for the special cost rules. This means that an
applicant can find out at an early stage what the financial risks are likely
to be if they proceed with the case. If the Court does not agree that the case
falls under the cost rules, the applicant can reconsider the proceedings and
the associated costs risk.

To further reduce costs, it is open to anyone taking a case in environmental
matters to enquire from legal practitioners if they are willing to take the
case on a ‘no foal, no fee’ basis. Under such an agreement, if you win your
case you will be entitled to recover your costs from the losing side, and if
you lose your case, your legal representatives have agreed not to seek their
fees.

See courts.ie for [ information on the court fees payable
](https://www.courts.ie/content/common-court-fees) .

The Environment (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2011 also [ requires that
judicial notice be taken of the Aarhus Convention
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2011/en/act/pub/0020/sec0008.html) .
