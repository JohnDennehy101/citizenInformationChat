##  Introduction

[ The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) ](/en/government-in-
ireland/data-protection/overview-of-general-data-protection-regulation/) came
into force across the EU on 25 May 2018.

The [ Data Protection Act 2018
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2018/act/7/enacted/en/html) , which was
signed into law on 24 May 2018, gave further effect to the GDPR in areas where
member states have flexibility (for example, the digital age of consent).

The GDPR very significantly increases the obligations and responsibilities for
organisations and businesses in how they collect, use and protect personal
data. Organisations and businesses are required to be fully transparent about
how they are using and safeguarding personal data, and to be able to
demonstrate accountability for their data processing activities.

###  Data protection definitions

Under the GDPR, _personal data_ is data that relates to or can identify an
individual either by itself or together with other available information.
Personal data can include your name, address, contact details, an
identification number, IP address, CCTV footage, access cards/co-tags, audio-
visual or audio recordings of a person and location data.

A _data subject_ is the individual to whom the personal data relates. You can
read about the rights of data subjects in our document [ Accessing your
personal data under GDPR ](/en/government-in-ireland/data-protection/rights-
under-general-data-protection-regulation/) .

Doing anything with your personal data, including storing it, is known as
_processing_ .

The organisation or business who decides what to do with your data is known as
a _controller_ . However, that entity can allow another person or entity to
process your personal data on its behalf. The person who processes the
information on behalf of the data controller is known as a _processor_ .

This document outlines the obligations of data controllers and processors
under the GDPR.

##  Data protection obligations

###  The obligation to lawfully process personal data

Organisations can only use or keep personal data where there is a lawful
reason. The GDPR sets out the six standard lawful reasons which can be used by
an organisation:

  * You have given your free and informed consent. 
  * The processing is necessary to carry out a contract which you are a party to, such as the delivery of a product 
  * The processing is necessary for the controller to comply with a legal obligation, such as the mandatory collection of details for anti-money laundering or tax purposes 
  * The processing is necessary to protect your vital interests or the vital interest of another person, such as accessing medical records in an emergency 
  * The processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or where the controller has official authority, such as public security processing 
  * The processing is necessary in the legitimate interests of the processing organisation if it doesn’t conflict with your rights, such as to prevent fraud 

You must be given enough information in simple and clear language to know what
an organisation is going to do with your personal data. This is often found in
privacy policies on websites or in forms which you can read or sign in person.

###  The obligation to design and operate appropriate processing systems

The GDPR has introduced the concepts of _data protection by design_ and _data
protection by default_ .

Data protection by design means data protection measures must be included when
any system is being designed by a controller. As a result, the chances of
inadvertent breaches of data protection legislation are reduced.

Data protection by default means that systems should be set up to be data
protection friendly. This should mean the only necessary personal data is
collected, that it is kept for the minimum period necessary and that a person
is not automatically opted-in to any unnecessary processing.

Controllers can apply for certification in Ireland from the Data Protection
Commission, which will demonstrate that their processes are designed to comply
with the Regulation.

###  The obligation to use processors that meet the requirements of the
legislation

Where processing is to be carried out by a processor and not the controller,
the controller must use only those processors who guarantee that their systems
of processing meet the requirements of the Regulation.

Examples of processors of his nature include payroll companies, accountants
and market research companies, all of which could hold or process personal
information on behalf of someone else. **Cloud providers** are also generally
data processors.

The controller must have a contract with the processor setting out the scope
of the processing required by the controller and the processor’s obligations
under the Regulation. A processor cannot outsource this processing to another
processor without the controller's consent and a similar contract agreed with
that second processor.

Processors should follow any relevant code of conduct that may be prepared by
the Data Protection Commission. Processors may also receive certification
demonstrating their compliance with the Regulation.

###  The obligation to keep records

Under the GDPR, any controller that has more than 250 employees, or that
processes sensitive information, must keep a record of the processing
activities under its responsibility.

That record should consist of:

  * The name and contact details of the controller 
  * The purposes of the processing 
  * A description of the categories of data subjects and personal data 
  * Categories of recipients of the data 
  * Any transfers of data to third countries and that country's data safeguards 
  * Time limits for erasure of data 
  * A description of the data security measures in place 

Processors must keep similar records. These records can be inspected by the
Data Protection Commission on request.

###  The obligation to keep data secure

Controllers and processors have an obligation to keep personal data secure.
They must also ensure that any employees do not access or process any data
unless they are required to do so. Under the GDPR, controllers and processors
must consider implementing modern security measures appropriate for the risks
involved in their activities. For example, risks may come from accidental or
unlawful destruction of stored data or unauthorised disclosure, access or
alteration.

The security measures may include anonymisation or encryption of data and
restoring or backing up stored data. Controllers and processors need to
regularly review and evaluate their security measures and also consider data
security when disposing of equipment.

###  The obligation to report data breaches

Under the GDPR, a controller must notify the Data Protection Commission of a
personal data breach without delay where that breach is a likely to result in
a risk to the rights and freedoms of the data subject. Notification should be
made. at the latest, within 72 hours of the controller becoming aware of the
breach. Data processors must notify the respective controllers if the
processor becomes aware of a breach. The controller should then notify the
data subject without delay.

A controller must also notify a data subject without delay in clear and plain
language if the data breach is likely to result in a high risk to the rights
and freedoms of the data subject. An example of a high risk situation would be
where your bank details are stolen.

###  The obligation to carry out data protection impact assessments

Under the GDPR, when a controller intends to carry out high-risk processing,
they must first carry out a data protection impact assessment (DPIA). The Data
Protection Commission has published a list of Data Processing Operations which
require a DPIA.

These processes include processing using new technology, profiling and
automated decision-making processing, processing large amounts of sensitive
personal data or systematically monitoring a publicly accessible area.

The data protection impact assessment should include:

  * A description of the processing and the purpose 
  * An assessment of the necessity of the processing 
  * An assessment of the risks to the rights and freedoms of the data subjects 
  * The measures to be used to address the risks 

The controller may consult with the Data Protection Commission, which may
provide advice to the controller. The Data Protection Commission has published
detailed guidance for controllers on how and when to carry out a DPIA.

The controller should carry out a review after the processing has begun to
ensure it is being performed in line with the data impact assessment that was
carried out.

The controller should also seek the advice of its data protection officer.

###  The obligation to appoint data protection officers (DPOs)

Under the GDPR, data protection officers must be appointed by controllers and
processors whose core activities consist of processing that requires regular
and systematic monitoring of data subjects on a large scale or of special
categories of personal data or data relating to criminal convictions and
offences.

Data protection officers:

  * Must be appointed on the basis of professional qualities and, in particular, expert knowledge on data protection law and practices 
  * May be a staff member or an external service provider 
  * Must provide contact details to the Data Protection Commission 
  * Must be provided with appropriate resources to carry out their tasks and maintain their expert knowledge 
  * Must report directly to the highest level of management in their organisation 
  * Must not carry out any other tasks that could result in a conflict of interest 

DPOs must be involved in all issues of data protection and must be given the
resources to carry out their tasks.

You can contact the DPO of an organisation about any issues relating to your
personal data held by that organisation.

The tasks of the DPO are to:

  * Inform and advise their organisation about its data protection obligations 
  * Monitor their organisation's compliance with the GDPR and any national data protection legislation 
  * Advise on data protection impact assessments and monitoring performance 
  * Liaise with the supervisory authority 

The Data Protection Commission has issued published detailed [ guidance on
appropriate qualifications for a DPO
](https://www.dataprotection.ie/en/organisations/know-your-obligations/data-
protection-officrs/guidance-appropriate-qualifications) .

###  The obligation to comply with codes of conduct and certification

Associations and other bodies representing controllers and processors may
prepare codes of practice that will specify how the GDPR should be
specifically applied. These bodies must submit their draft codes of conduct to
the Data Protection Commission for approval.

In order to enhance transparency and compliance with this Regulation, the GDPR
will introduce certification mechanisms and data protection marks, allowing
data subjects to quickly assess the level of data protection of relevant
products and services. A list of certified organisations will be publicly
available.

Codes of conduct and approved certification mechanisms will also assist
controllers, in identifying the risks related to their type of processing and
in adhering to best practice.

Complying with an approved code of conduct or an approved certification
mechanism may be used as an element to demonstrate compliance with the
obligations of the controller or processor under the GDPR.

###  The obligations relating to transferring data outside the EU

Any transfer of personal data outside the EU or to an international
organisation will be strictly regulated under the GDPR. The Regulation also
applies to any onward transfer of personal data from one non-EU member state
to another.

Such a transfer of personal data may take place where the European Commission
has decided that the non-EU member state or business sector within that
country has an adequate level of data protection in place. In deciding if
there is adequate protection, the Commission will look at that country's laws,
respect for human rights, the existence of any data protection authority and
the international commitments that country has made relating to personal data.
After deciding if a country or sector has adequate data protection, the
Commission will continue to monitor that country in terms of its data
protection practices.

The Commission publishes a list of all such approved countries, sectors and
international organisations.

If a controller or processor wants to transfer data to an **unapproved**
country, sector or international organisation, that controller or processor
must provide the appropriate safeguards and ensure that any data subjects will
still be able to exercise their rights.

####  Transferring data to the UK

Before the end of the transition period, any personal information received by
any company or organisation in the UK from companies and administrations in
other member states was covered by the GDPR.

Transfers of personal data to the UK continue to be permitted on the basis of
a formal decision (called an adequacy decision) made by the European
Commission on 28 June 2021. That adequacy decision will remain in place for
four years unless the UK makes changes to its data protection legislation.

##  Supervision and enforcement

###  Independent supervisory authorities

Under the GDPR, each EU member state must have one or more independent public
authorities responsible for monitoring the application of the Regulation. In
Ireland, this supervisory authority is the Data Protection Commission.

The Data Protection Commission:

  * Monitors and enforces the application of the GDPR 
  * Promotes public awareness of the rules and rights around data processing 
  * Advises the Government on data protection issues 
  * Promotes awareness among controllers and processors of their obligations 
  * Provides information to individuals about their data protection rights 
  * Maintains a list of processing operations requiring data protection impact assessment 
  * Handles complaints and conducts investigations related to compliance with data protection law 

The Data Protection Commission has the power to order any controller or
processor to provide information that the authority requires to assess
compliance with the Regulation. It may carry out investigations of controllers
and processors in the form of data audits, including accessing the premises of
a controller or processor. It can order a controller or processor to change
their processes, comply with data subject requests. The Data Protection
Commission can also issue warnings to controllers and processors and can ban
processing as well as commence legal proceedings against a controller or
processor.

Organisations that are engaged in cross-border processing of personal data can
choose to deal with a single lead supervisory authority, a [ one stop shop
(OSS) ](https://www.dataprotection.ie/en/organisations/international-
transfers/one-stop-shop-oss) for most of their processing activities.

###  European Data Protection Board

The GDPR introduced a new European data protection supervisory authority. The
[ European Data Protection Board (EDPB) ](https://edpb.europa.eu/about-
edpb/about-edpb_en) is responsible for ensuring the GDPR is applied
consistently across The European Union. It will issue guidelines and
recommendations on the application of the Regulation. It will also advise the
EU Commission on the application of the Regulation and any updates that may be
required.

The EDPB is made up of the head of one supervisory authority of each member
state and a European Data Protection supervisor or their representatives.

###  Penalties

Penalties apply to both controllers and processors who breach the Regulation.
There are different penalties, depending on the seriousness of the breach.

###  Serious infringements

For the most serious infringements (for example, not having sufficient
customer consent to process data or violating the core of privacy by design
concepts) organisations can be fined up to 4% of their annual global turnover
or €20 million, whichever is greater.

###  Lesser breaches

Under the GDPR, organisations in breach of the Regulation can be fined up to
2% of their annual global turnover or €10 million, whichever is greater, for
lesser breaches. Some examples of lesser breaches include: not having records
in order, not notifying the supervisory authority and data subject about a
breach or not conducting an impact assessment.
