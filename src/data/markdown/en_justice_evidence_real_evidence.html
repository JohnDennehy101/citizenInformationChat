##  Introduction

Real evidence is material, tangible evidence such as an object, a tape
recording, a computer printout or a photograph. It is evidence that the court
can examine for itself.

Generally, real evidence does not stand alone, and the court will hear
evidence from a witness (often an [ expert witness
](/en/justice/witnesses/types-of-witnesses/) ) explaining the significance or
the relevance of the real evidence.

##  Types of real evidence

###  Material objects

An example of a material object in a murder case is the murder weapon. This is
a piece of real evidence, which can be introduced in court. Sometimes, it is
impossible to produce a material object at trial because it has been destroyed
or lost. Photographs, replicas or the oral evidence of someone who has seen
the object may be allowed instead.

Sometimes, if the material object cannot be shown in court a 'view' or an out-
of-court inspection can be carried out.

###  Photographs

Photographs can be introduced as evidence of what they show. For example, in a
murder trial, photographs can be introduced as evidence of the position and
state of the deceased's body when it was found.

A photograph’s authenticity must be proven before it can be admitted as
evidence. The photographer must prove that they took the photograph, and the
person who processed it must make a statement saying that the photograph is
untouched.

Photographs do not need to be taken by a professional photographer to be
admitted as evidence. For example, in a civil case, photographs you have taken
of damage done to your car in a road traffic accident will be allowed (as long
as you are available to give evidence in court about when and how you took the
photographs).

###  Video recordings

Incidents or crimes are often captured and recorded by video cameras or CCTV.
These recordings are accepted in court as real evidence. If evidence of a
crime is recorded on a street or shop camera, the Gardaí are obliged to seize
and keep the recording for a reasonable time, even if they do not intend to
use it as part of the prosecution case.

In order to use video recordings as evidence, the prosecution must prove that
the video recording is authentic or genuine. The prosecution must explain how
and why the recording was made and who had the recording after it was made.
The defence can object on these grounds, and if they do, it is up to the judge
to decide whether to allow the recording as evidence.

If the Gardaí decide not to use a recording as evidence at trial, the
prosecution or Gardaí must notify the defence that the recording exists. They
must also give the defence advance notice if they decide to destroy the
recording. Because even though the recording may not be of use to the
prosecution, it may help the accused prove they were not at the [ scene of the
crime ](/en/justice/evidence/crime-scenes/) .

While there is a duty on the Gardaí to collect video evidence, they do not
have to go to extreme lengths to do so. For example, the Gardaí would not need
to collect every piece of video evidence on O’Connell Street in Dublin if
there was a theft from a shop on the street.

###  Out-of-court inspection

A _view_ is an out-of-court inspection of a place or an object that can’t be
brought into court. For example, the judge (and the jury if it is a criminal
case) and the people involved in the case can leave the court to inspect a
large machine or a motor vehicle that is of importance to the case.

A view is admissible as evidence in a [ criminal case ](/en/justice/criminal-
law/criminal-trial/criminal-trial/) or a [ civil case ](/en/justice/civil-
law/taking-and-appealing-a-civil-case/) . However, in most cases, it is not
necessary to leave the court to examine a place or an object as a photograph
or a video recording of the place or object will be accepted in court.

###  A person’s appearance and behaviour

A person’s physical appearance and their characteristics can be used as real
evidence. For example, in a [ personal injuries ](/en/justice/civil-
law/injuries-resolution-board/) case the injured person can show the judge a
scar they got as a result of the incident. Animals can also be produced to
assess their temperament.

The demeanour of a witness when giving [ oral evidence
](/en/justice/witnesses/rules-about-giving-evidence/) is considered real
evidence. The judge can take this into account when deciding if this evidence
is credible.

###  Forensic evidence

Forensic evidence is material or traces of material that have been analysed by
a forensic science laboratory. Forensic evidence is collected by members of
the Gardaí who are specially trained to do this. They must ensure that samples
are not compromised or contaminated when they are collected and stored.

Forensic science laboratories closely examine materials such as paint, glass,
soil, hair, fibres, firearm residues, fire accelerants and footprint samples.
These samples may have been taken from the scene of the crime or may have been
found on the [ victim ](/en/justice/victims-of-crime/your-rights-as-a-victim-
of-crime/) or the suspect.

Forensic evidence has many uses, for instance:

  * The presence of a material in itself may be significant, for example, the presence of firearms residue on a suspect's clothes 
  * Samples of materials may be matched, for example, fibres found on the suspect's jumper match the victim's blouse 
  * Unique marks may be identified, for example, footprints 

Forensic evidence tends to prove that a suspect was at the scene of the crime.
For example, if a window was broken by a burglar to get into a house, the
suspect's clothing will be examined for small glass fragments. The window will
also be examined for fibres that may have come from the burglar's clothing.
There may also be [ DNA evidence ](/en/justice/evidence/dna-evidence/) .

When forensic evidence is introduced in court, it is usually be explained by
an expert - a forensic scientist. The scientist explains what was done with
the sample and how it was analysed. The scientist can then explain the
laboratory's findings.
