##  Introduction

There are different options to help you stay connected and access the internet
from your home.

The internet connection you can get will depend on where you live, the
infrastructure in place and the service providers that operate in your area.

The Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg) provides information on
internet services. You can compare charges for internet services and combined
packages across all operators. Use [ the website
](https://www.comreg.ie/compare/#/services) to help select the best package
for your internet needs.

##  Broadband speeds and connections

Broadband is high speed internet access. Speeds are measured in Mbps (megabits
per second), often shortened to Mb. The higher the number of Mbps or Mb, the
faster the connection and online activity should be.

###  Download and upload speeds

You should check download and upload speeds when comparing broadband packages.

####  **Download speed**

This is the speed you can receive content from the internet, for example,
download a song or watch a movie on streaming services like Netflix.

####  **Upload speed**

This is the speed you can send content, for example, to send an email or
upload a photo to a website.

###  'Up to' and 'unlimited'

Many ISPs say ‘up to’ a certain Mbps or Mb of download or upload speed when
advertising plans. This is because the speed that you can get in your home
will depend on:

  * The type of connection you have 
  * The modem or router you use 
  * Where you live 
  * How your mobile, tablet, or PC are connected, it could be directly to the modem or through WiFi. 

Many broadband plans offer ‘unlimited’ data. This is often subject to a ‘fair
usage’ policy. Service providers must make sure that usage limits or ‘fair
usage’ policies are explained in the terms and conditions in a clear and
understandable way.

###  Flat rate and extra charges

Broadband plans are usually offered at a flat rate which means that you will
be charged the same for internet services every month.

If you go over the monthly data allowance this could mean extra charges. The
ISP may also need to send out a technician which could mean extra charges for
installation.

###  Bundles

Broadband is often offered as part of a package or bundle with TV or [ home
phone ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/consumer/phone-internet-tv-and-
postal-services/phone-contracts/) . These types of packages can be good value
but only if you plan to use them. Make sure you are happy with what is being
offered for each part of the bundle (for example the data speed, the amount of
TV channels and the calls included for home phone) before you sign the
contract.

ComReg has an independent price guide to help you [ compare the cost of
broadband packages ](https://www.comreg.ie/compare/#/services) .

##  Internet services and your rights

ComReg is a statutory body responsible for regulating the communications
sector. All providers must be registered with ComReg before they can provide
an electronic communications network or service. Find out more about [
regulation of postal services, phone, internet and TV. ](/en/consumer/phone-
internet-tv-and-postal-services/regulation-of-postal-services-phone-internet-
radion-and-tv/)

###  Your right to basic internet access

You have a right to good quality electronic communications, including basic
internet access, under the [ Universal Service Directive ](https://eur-
lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32002L0022&from=EN) . There
should be at least one internet provider who can provide basic internet
service to you.

###  **Information you must get when you sign up**

Before you sign up, your internet service provider must give you:

  * The name and address of the service provider 
  * Details of the service 
  * The quality levels (for example, download speeds) 
  * Details of the pricing and charges 
  * How long the contract is and how to renew or cancel it 
  * Information about your right to compensation or refund if service quality levels are not met 

When you sign up to a new contract, you can only be tied into the contract for
24 months (2 years) or less.

Your consumer rights are set out in the [ European Communities (Electronic
Communications Networks and Services) (Universal Service and Users' Rights)
Regulations 2011 ](https://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2011/si/337/) .

###  Other consumer rights

You also have the following [ consumer rights
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/consumer/consumer-laws/your-consumer-
rights/) when you sign up to an internet contract:

  * **Get what you paid for:** your provider must provide the service they have sold you. You can expect to get a service that works as described in your contract. 
  * **Clear contract terms:** that are in [ clear, plain and understandable ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/consumer/consumer-laws/terms-and-conditions/) language and do not put you at an unfair disadvantage. 
  * **Fair sales practices:** providers must not use [ misleading or aggressive sales practices ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/consumer/advertising-and-promotions/unfair-sales-practices/) that could affect your decision to buy. 
  * **Changes to your contract terms:** can only be made after you have got 30 days’ notice and the option to leave the contract. This includes price changes. 

##  Cancelling your contract

You should check the terms and conditions of your contract to find out what
your cancellation rights are. You could have to pay a fee to cancel a
contract.

Your legal right to cancel the contract for free depends on whether you signed
up by phone, in person, or online.

###  You signed up by phone or online

You can cancel the contract if you signed up less than 14 days ago over the
phone or online. This is called a [ ‘cooling-off’ period
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/consumer/shopping/shopping-online/) .
If you’ve already used the service, you are likely to be charged for what you
have used.

If you cancel outside of the cooling off period, you may be charged a penalty
fee or pay off the rest of your contract. Check the terms and conditions of
your contract.

###  You signed up in person

You have no legal right to a 14-day cooling-off period if you signed up in
person in a shop.

Any costs and charges for cancelling your contract should be made clear in
your contract and at the point of sale.

##  Switching providers

When comparing internet service providers and plans, think about:

  * Price of the contract and what’s included in the price (for example, TV and landline) 
  * Charges and fees (are there connection charges, monthly rental fees, call costs, disconnection or reconnection charges?) 
  * What speed you need 
  * What data limits apply and are they enough? 
  * Minimum contract period 
  * Penalties for ending the contract early 
  * Network coverage in your area 

Before you switch, contact your current provider to check if any cancellation
period or penalties apply.

If your broadband service needs a telephone line to access the internet, you
will probably need your Universal Account Number (UAN) to switch. This is
usually on your bill, but if you can’t find it, you can ask your existing
provider.

###  Signing up

Once you have picked a plan, you can sign up by:

  * Giving your consent over the phone and having that conservation recorded 
  * Signing a customer authorisation form 
  * Filling in an online customer authorisation form 

Check if your new service provider will contract your old service provider to
start the change-over and if there is anything else you need to do to help
with this.

###

##  Billing options

You can get your bills by email or through the provider’s website. If you
can’t get bills in an electronic format because of limited access to the
internet or other issues, the provider must give you a paper bill for free.
You must be told when the bill is available online (for example, by text
message).

You may receive a single bill for a bundle (home phone, broadband and TV) but
if you make calls, texts or data outside your allocated allowance, you will be
charged at a much higher rate.

When you switch to a new provider, your first bill may be higher than
expected. This is because you are paying from the date your service was
connected as well as the price plan for the month ahead.

ComReg has more information about [ internet billing
](https://www.comreg.ie/consumer-information/internet/billing-and-disputed-
charges/) .

##  Disputed charges

###  **Monitor your usage**

Make sure you know how to monitor your usage. You can ask your provider to
notify you when you reach the limit of your bundle.

Some service providers provide you with alerts when you reach your package
limit without you having to ask for this. Some service providers only do this
if you ask. You should check this, so that you avoid bill shock.

Most service providers will try to notify you if your data downloads are
likely to result in very high bills. You should check this with your service
provider.

###  **Incorrect billing**

If you get a bill that you think is incorrect you should raise this
immediately with your service provider as a complaint.

You should give your provider 10 working days to investigate and resolve the
billing issue. If they haven’t resolved the issue or you’re not happy with the
response, you can contact ComReg who can escalate your complaint with your
service provider on your behalf.

See more information below on making a complaint.

##  Making a complaint

If you have a problem with the contract or the service (for example, network
coverage issues or billing disputes), contact your provider to try sort out
the issue.

If you can’t fix the problem informally, you can complain in writing to the
internet service provider.

If you are not happy with the response, you can contact ComReg for more advice
and help.
