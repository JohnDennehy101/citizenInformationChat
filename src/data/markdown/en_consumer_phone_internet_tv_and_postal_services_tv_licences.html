##  Introduction

If you have a TV, you must have a TV licence.

A TV licence costs €160 a year for both homes and businesses. If you are over
70, you are entitled to a free TV licence under the Household Benefits
package.

You can be fined up to €1,000 (or €2,000 for subsequent offences) if you do
not have a TV licence when you need one.

##  Do I need a TV licence?

If you have a TV, you must have a TV licence. This applies even if the TV is
broken, as it is capable of being fixed. If you have other equipment capable
of receiving TV signals (for example by using an aerial, satellite dish or
cable), you must also have a TV licence.

You only need one TV licence for your whole house, even if you have multiple
TVs in your home.

If you are living in an apartment or flat and have a TV, you need your own TV
licence. A separate licence is required for each separate flat or apartment.

###  **I have a Smart TV**

You need a TV licence if you have a Smart TV, even if you only use the TV for
streaming. This is because the TV is capable of receiving TV signals.

###  Watching TV on your computer, phone or other device

You don’t need a TV licence to watch television on your computer, phone or
other device (for example, RTÉ Player or [ streaming services
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/consumer/buying-digital-content-and-
services/your-rights-when-you-buy-digital-content-or-services/) like Netflix).

However, the computer, phone or other device must not be capable of receiving
a TV signal by cable, satellite or aerial.

###  Living in rented accommodation

If you are renting and there is a TV, you must have a TV licence. This applies
whether you or the landlord owns the TV.

###  Second homes

If you have a TV in your second home, or holiday home, you must get a separate
licence for this house. This is the case even if you already have a TV licence
for your main home.

###  Business premises

If you have TVs in your office or business premises, you need a TV licence.
One TV licence covers all TVs at your business premises. If you have more than
one business premises, then you also need separate TV licences for each
address.

###  Moving to Ireland from another country

If you have moved to Ireland, you can’t transfer a TV licence from overseas.
You must buy a new licence here. This is the case even if you are living in
Ireland for a short time.

Each TV licence is only valid in Ireland and lasts for 1 year. If you leave
the country before it expires, you cannot get a refund on the fee paid.

##  Getting your first time TV licence

You can buy a TV licence for the first time:

  * In person, at your local An Post office (using cash, cheque, credit or debit card or by using TV licence saving stamps) 
  * Online, through [ TV Licence Online ](https://www.tvlicence.ie/Homepage.aspx)
  * By phone, on (01) 705 8800 (for credit or debit card transactions only) 
  * By direct debit, using [ forms available from your TV Licence Records Office ](https://www.tvlicence.ie/home/records-office.html) – payments are by monthly, quarterly, half-yearly or yearly instalments 

A TV licence costs €160 a year for both homes and businesses.

Your first TV licence is valid until the end of the 11th month following the
month it was issued. For example, if the licence was issued in the middle of
April, it is valid until the end of March the following year. When you renew
it, the new licence is valid for 12 months.

##  Who qualifies for a free TV licence?

If you are over 70, you can get a TV licence free as part of the [ Household
Benefits Package ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-
welfare/social-welfare-payments/extra-social-welfare-benefits/household-
benefits-package/) . Some people under 70 may also qualify for the Household
Benefits Package and a free licence.

You must select the TV licence option on the form when you apply for the
Household Benefits Package.

If you qualify, you become eligible for a free licence from the next renewal
date of your existing licence.

The Department of Social Protection issues you with your free licence and also
tells An Post you are entitled to a free licence for as long as you are
entitled to the Household Benefits Package.

##  Renewing your TV licence

When your licence is due for renewal, you will receive a reminder by post or
by email.

You can renew your TV licence:

  * In person, at your local An Post office (using cash, cheque, credit or debit card or by using TV licence saving stamps). Bring your reminder notice so that the barcode can be scanned at the counter 
  * Online, through [ TV Licence Online ](https://www.tvlicence.ie/Homepage.aspx) . You need the 17 digit TV reference number and 5 digit PIN so that you can log on. 
  * By phone, on (01) 705 8800 (for credit or debit card transactions only). You need the 17 digit TV reference number. 

###  How long is the licence valid?

Your new licence is valid from the date the old licence expires. This applies
even if you paid for it later than the expiry date. For example, your licence
expires on 31 January 2022 but you are late renewing and only pay for it on 1
March 2022. The new licence is valid from 1 February 2022 to 31 January 2023.

##  Where can I find my TV licence number?

Your TV licence number (or TV reference number) is a 17 digit number [ shown
on your renewal notice ](https://www.tvlicence.ie/RefNoPin.htm) , together
with your 5 digit PIN.

If you don’t have these details, you need to write to or email your [ local TV
Records office ](https://www.tvlicence.ie/home/records-office.html) . You will
get a new PIN each year.

##  Changing your personal details

If you are moving house, you can transfer your TV licence to your new address.

Bring your licence to your nearest An Post office, with evidence of your new
address (for example a household utility bill or a bank statement). An Post
will update your details and reissue the licence for free.

You can also go online to [ update your TV licence records
](https://www.tvlicence.ie/ChangeAddressLogOn.aspx) . You will need your TV
licence number and PIN.

You can change other personal details in the same way - either online or at
your nearest An Post office.

Your change of address or other personal details will be updated on the TV
licence database within 10 working days.

##  If you don’t pay your TV licence

If you have not paid your TV licence, you can get a notice from An Post to
warn you that you could be prosecuted if you don't buy a TV licence.

A TV licence inspector can visit your home to check if you have a TV.

If you don't have a TV licence to show the inspector, you could face a court
appearance. If convicted, you could be fined €1,000 for a first offence and
€2,000 for subsequent offences.

If you have been fined and you breach court orders directing you to pay their
television licence, you can be imprisoned.

If you receive a TV licence notice but do not have a TV in your home or
business premises, you should fill out [ Statutory Declaration Form (PDF)
](https://www.tvlicence.ie/home/pdfs/StatutoryDeclaration.pdf) and return it
to your local [ TV Licence Records Office
](https://www.tvlicence.ie/home/records-office.html) .

##  Where does the TV licence fee go?

[ An Post
](https://www.anpost.com/?gclid=CjwKCAiAzuPuBRAIEiwAkkmOSM241Vt9r49qtVsWedjfeJkafdOyFQaKhQDPJ4FjHqnh_iJ5vKdgtBoChDgQAvD_BwE)
is the designated body, under the [ Broadcasting Act 2009
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2009/act/18/enacted/en/print#sec140) ,
that issues TV licences and collects fees on behalf of the [ Department of
Communications, Climate Action and Environment ](https://www.dccae.gov.ie/en-
ie/Pages/default.aspx) . The Department pays a commission from TV licence fee
receipts to An Post for this work.

7% of revenue from the TV licence fees is paid to the Broadcasting Authority
of Ireland (BAI) for the Broadcasting Fund. It is used to support the
production of programmes on Irish culture, heritage and experience and
programmes to improve adult literacy.

The remaining revenue (approximately 85%) from TV licence fees goes to RTÉ to
carry out its public service broadcasting commitments.
