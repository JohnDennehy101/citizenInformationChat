#  Public health measures for COVID-19

  * Measures and restrictions 
  * Travel restrictions 
  * Previous measures 

##  Measures and restrictions

There are currently [ no COVID-19 restrictions ](/en/health/covid19/living-
with-covid19-plan/) in Ireland. You should continue to follow public health
advice to [ protect yourself and others
](https://www2.hse.ie/conditions/covid19/preventing-the-spread/protect-
yourself-and-others/) .

##  Travel restrictions

All COVID-19 restrictions for travelling to Ireland have been lifted. You no
longer need to complete a passenger locator form. You also no longer need
proof of vaccination or recovery, or a COVID-19 test.

###  Travel abroad

You should check the public health advice, document requirements and COVID-19
restrictions that are in place in the country you are going to. You should do
this even if you are [ travelling to an EEA country ](/en/travel-and-
recreation/travel-abroad/travelling-abroad-during-covid#l7fbe5) .

Ireland was operating the [ EU Digital COVID Certificate ](/en/travel-and-
recreation/travel-abroad/digital-covid-certificate/) for travel within the EU
and EEA. Since 1 July 2023, you will no longer get an EU Digital Covid
Certificate for a negative test (PCR and antigen) or as proof of recovery
(recovery certificates).

###  Laws in place now

The Government continues to issue guidance to help prevent the spread of
COVID-19, however the laws in force during the pandemic are no longer in
place.

###  Face coverings

It is no longer mandatory to wear a face-mask in any indoor setting.

You may be asked to wear a face mask when visiting some health and care
settings. The healthcare staff will let you know if you need to. If you have
symptoms of COVID-19, cold or flu, it may not be safe to visit a health or
care setting. Contact them for advice before visiting.

You can [ read more about face masks ](/en/health/covid19/face-coverings-
during-covid19/) .

The ' [ Reframing the Challenge, Continuing Our Recovery and Reconnecting

Measures in the Public Interest) Act 2020
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2020/act/1/enacted/en/html) ended. This
gave the Minister for Health the power to make regulations and introduce
measures to slow down the spread of the virus. It also allowed for the
detention of someone who was a potential source of infection and risk to
public health, if it was necessary to slow the spread of COVID-19. During the
COVID-19 pandemic various regulations gave An Garda Síochána additional
powers, including arrest without warrant. Offences were punishable by a fine
of up to €5,000, up to six months imprisonment, or a combination of both.
