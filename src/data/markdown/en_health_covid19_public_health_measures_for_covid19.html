##  Measures and restrictions

There are currently [ no COVID-19 restrictions ](/en/health/covid19/living-

advice to [ protect yourself and others
](https://www2.hse.ie/conditions/covid19/preventing-the-spread/protect-
yourself-and-others/) .

##  Travel restrictions

All COVID-19 restrictions for travelling to Ireland have been lifted. You no
longer need to complete a passenger locator form. You also no longer need
proof of vaccination or recovery, or a COVID-19 test.

###  Travel abroad

You should check the public health advice, document requirements and COVID-19
restrictions that are in place in the country you are going to. You should do
this even if you are [ travelling to an EEA country ](/en/travel-and-
recreation/travel-abroad/travelling-abroad-during-covid#l7fbe5) .

Ireland was operating the [ EU Digital COVID Certificate ](/en/travel-and-
recreation/travel-abroad/digital-covid-certificate/) for travel within the EU
and EEA. Since 1 July 2023, you will no longer get an EU Digital Covid
Certificate for a negative test (PCR and antigen) or as proof of recovery
(recovery certificates).

###  Laws in place now

The Government continues to issue guidance to help prevent the spread of
COVID-19, however the laws in force during the pandemic are no longer in
place.

###  Face coverings

It is no longer mandatory to wear a face-mask in any indoor setting.

You may be asked to wear a face mask when visiting some health and care
settings. The healthcare staff will let you know if you need to. If you have
symptoms of COVID-19, cold or flu, it may not be safe to visit a health or
care setting. Contact them for advice before visiting.
