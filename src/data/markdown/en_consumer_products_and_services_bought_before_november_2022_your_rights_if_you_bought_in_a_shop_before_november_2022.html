##  Introduction

This page explains your consumer rights if you bought something in a shop **on
or before 28 November 2022.**

You have different rights if you [ bought on or after 28 November 2022
](/en/consumer/shopping/rights-when-buying-in-a-shop/) . This is because the [
Consumer Rights Act 2022(pdf)
](https://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2022/act/37/enacted/en/pdf) introduced [
new consumer rights ](/en/consumer/consumer-laws/your-consumer-rights/) .

##  Your rights

When you bought the goods, you made a contract with the seller. Under the
contract, you and the seller have certain legal rights and obligations.

You have the same rights whether you bought at full price, reduced price (for
example, in a sale) or bought a second-hand good (if bought from a business).

In some cases, you are restricted by a seller’s shop policy or terms and
conditions, for example where you simply change your mind – see ‘Returning
products you do not want’ below.

**Quality, performance and durability**

Under the [ Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Act, 1980
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1980/act/16/enacted/en/html) , the goods
you bought must meet standards of quality, performance and durability.

Goods must be:

  * **Of satisfactory (merchantable) quality** taking into account durability and price 
  * **Fit for the purpose** you bought it 
  * **As described,** matching any description advertised or other information the seller gave you 

You can read more about the stronger consumer rights that you have if [ you
bought in a shop after 1 October 2022 ](/en/consumer/shopping/rights-when-
buying-in-a-shop/) .

##  Returning something you do notwant

You have no automatic right to a refund if you change your mind about goods
you bought in a shop. If there is nothing wrong with the item, you have no
legal right to return it. Whether you can get your money back depends on the
seller’s returns policy.

Most sellers allow you to return or replace goods during a certain period. The
seller can offer a refund, exchange or credit note as a goodwill gesture.

If the seller accepts returns, you should:

  * Make sure the items are in good condition 
  * Keep the original labels and tags attached 
  * Have proof of purchase (for example, a receipt) 

The Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC) has more information
about [ changing your mind. ](https://www.ccpc.ie/consumers/shopping/buying-
goods/changing-your-mind)

##  If things go wrong

You have a right to certain _remedies_ if the goods you bought are not of
merchantable quality, fit for purchase or as described. A remedy can be a [
repair, replacement, or refund. ](/en/consumer/shopping/problems-with-faulty-
goods/)

If the fault appears within the first 6 months, it is assumed that there was a
problem when you got the goods and it is up to the seller to prove otherwise.
If the fault appears after the first 6 months, you can be asked to prove that
there was a problem when you got it.

###  If you bought sale items

If you bought the item on sale, you have the same rights as if you paid full
price.

##  How to complain

If things go wrong, you should follow these steps:

  1. Bring the product back to the seller with original packaging, if possible and proof of purchase such as receipt, bank or credit card statement, or invoice 
  2. Explain what the problem is and how you want it corrected 
  3. If needed, follow up with a written formal complaint 

If you cannot resolve the problem, you can:

  * Contact the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC) for information and advice 
  * Contact your bank or credit card provider to use chargeback. The CCPC has more information [ on chargeback ](https://www.ccpc.ie/consumers/money/credit-cards/disputed-card-transactions-chargeback/)
  * Take a claim against the seller using the [ Small Claims Procedure ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/justice/courts_system/small_claims_court.en.html)
