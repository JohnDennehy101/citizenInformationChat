#  Categories of motor vehicles and minimum age of drivers

  * Introduction 
  * Motorcycles and mopeds 
  * Car and work vehicles 
  * Buses and trucks 
  * Trailers 

##  Introduction

Motor vehicles in Ireland are divided into different categories for driver
licensing purposes. This is a standard practice throughout the [ European
Union ](/en/government-in-ireland/european-government/european-union/european-
union/) . Before you can apply for a licence to drive a vehicle in Ireland,
you must be a certain age.

The [ categories of vehicles ](https://www.ndls.ie/licence-categories.html)
you are allowed to drive and use are listed on your licence. It is a serious
offence to drive any vehicle for which you do not have a licence.

You are only allowed to drive the category of vehicle for which your licence
or permit has been issued.

If you want another category added, you may have to complete the application
process and a test. Your current licence must be in date if you want another
category added to your licence. Certain categories may be added automatically
to your licence and you do not need to do another test. For example, if you
have a licence to drive a car, you can automatically drive a tractor.

##  Motorcycles and mopeds

###  Motorcycles and mopeds

The categories and driver’s minimum age for motorcycles and mopeds are:

**Motorcycle and moped categories** **Category** |  **Vehicle type** |  **Minimum age of driver**  
---|---|---  
AM  |  Mopeds and light quadricycles  |  16 years   
A1  |  Motorcycles with an engine capacity not exceeding 125 cubic centimetres, with a power rating not exceeding 11 kW and with a power to weight ratio not exceeding 0.1 kW/kg.  Motor tricycles with a power rating not exceeding 15 kW.  |  16 years   
A2  |  Motorcycles of 35kW or less, with a maximum power/weight ratio of 0.2 kW/kg, and not derived from a vehicle of more than double its power.  |  18 years   
A  |  Motorcycles  Motor tricycles  |  20 years (progressive access)  24 years (Direct access)  21 years Motor tricycles   
  
You can access the various motorcycle categories by direct access or
progressive access.

Direct access is where you have not previously held a full motorcycle licence
in a lower category.

Progressive access applies to categories A2 and A. This means that you may be
allowed to complete a course of training to get the higher motorcycle category
full licence. See the [ RSA’s Motorcycle Chart (PDF)
](https://www.rsa.ie/docs/default-source/services/s1.4-driving-
lessons/process-of-obtaining-a-motorcycle-driving-
licence.pdf?sfvrsn=4e7d68fe_3) for more information on accessing a higher
category motorcycle licence.

##  Car and work vehicles

The categories and driver’s minimum age for cars and work vehicles are as
follows:

**Cars and work vehicles categories** **Category** |  **Vehicle type** |  **Minimum age of driver**  
---|---|---  
B  |  Vehicles (other than motorcycles, mopeds, work vehicles or land tractors) with seats for a maximum of 8 passengers and a maximum weight of 3,500kg (can tow a trailer where the maximum weight of the trailer when fully loaded is 750kg or less) or where the combined MAM1 of the towing vehicle and the trailer does not exceed 3,500 kg.  Quadricycles (other than those covered by AM) are also covered by this category.  |  17 years   
W  |  Work vehicles and land tractor with or without a trailer.  |  16 years   
  
Maximum Authorised Mass (MAM1 also known as Design Gross Vehicle Weight
D.G.V.W) means design laden weight. Manufacturers generally refer to it as
gross vehicle weight (g.v.w.) and it is usually displayed on a metal plate
attached to the vehicle by the manufacturer.

Learner permits for category B do not allow you to pull a trailer.

##  Buses and trucks

The categories and driver’s minimum age for buses and trucks are:

**Buses and trucks categories** **Category** |  **Vehicle type** |  **Minimum age of driver**  
---|---|---  
C1  |  Vehicles in category C having a MAM1 weight not exceeding 7,500 kg, having passenger accommodation for not more than 8 persons in addition to the driver and where the MAM1 of the trailer is not greater than 750 kg.  |  18 years  (You must hold a full B licence before taking out a C1 permit)   
C  |  Vehicles (other than work vehicles or land tractors) having a MAM1 exceeding 3,500 kg, having passenger accommodation for not more than 8 persons in addition to the driver and where the MAM1 of the trailer is not greater than 750 kg.  |  18 years with CPC  21 years without CPC  (You must hold a full B licence before taking out a C permit)

with a maximum weight greater than 750kg when fully loaded, are:

**Trailer categories** **Category** |  **Vehicle type** |  **Minimum age of driver**
