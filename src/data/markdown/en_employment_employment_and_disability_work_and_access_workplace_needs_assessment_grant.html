accessible for people with disabilities.

Funding is available to qualifying job candidates, employees, self-employed
people, and employers.

There are 7 categories of Work and Access support:

  * Workplace Needs Assessment 
  * [ Communication Support ](/en/employment/employment-and-disability/work-and-access-communication-support-grant/)
  * [ In-Work Support ](/en/employment/employment-and-disability/work-and-access-in-work-support-grant/)

  * [ Workplace Adaptation ](/en/employment/employment-and-disability/workplace-equipment-adaptation-grant/)
  * [ Disability Equality and Inclusion Training ](/en/employment/employment-and-disability/disability-equality-and-inclusion-training-grant/)

This page explains the Workplace Needs Assessment Grant. Depending on your

the [ Work and Access Programme
](https://control.citizensinformation.ie/en/employment/employment-and-

##  What is the Workplace Needs Assessment Grant?

The Workplace Needs Assessment Grant provides up to €2,500 to help people with
disabilities or health conditions identify the supports they need in their
workplace to do their job effectively.

##  Why do I need a workplace needs assessment?

A workplace needs assessment helps identify necessary adjustments to remove
barriers you may face while doing your job or returning to work.

The assessment can cover working at a business premises, at home, or from a
remote working location.

You must get a specialist to do the assessment.

###  **Communication support for the assessment**

If you need communication support during the assessment, you can apply for it
(for example an interpreter).

To qualify for communication support, you must meet one of the following
criteria:

  * Be deaf or hard of hearing, needing an [ Irish Sign Language ](https://www.risli.ie/) interpreter, lip-speaker, or other deaf interpreter. 
  * Have a disability or health condition that requires communication support.
