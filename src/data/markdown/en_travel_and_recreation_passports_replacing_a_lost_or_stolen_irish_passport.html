  * What happens if my passport is lost or stolen? 
  * Losing your Irish passport in Ireland 
  * Losing your Irish passport abroad 
  * How to replace a damaged passport 
  * Costs of renewing your passport 
  * Where to apply 

##  Introduction

Your [ Irish passport ](/en/travel-and-recreation/passports/irish-passports-
an-overview/) is an important legal document.

Lost, stolen, or damaged passports can be [ renewed online
](https://www.ireland.ie/en/dfa/passports/passport-online/) . You can report
your passport as lost or stolen when you apply online for your new passport.

If you apply using the paper application form, fill out Section 6, explain how
your passport was lost, stolen or damaged and get it witnessed and stamped.

If you have lost your Irish passport abroad, you should first make a report to
the local police and then notify your nearest [ Irish embassy or consulate
](https://www.ireland.ie/en/dfa/embassies/) .

They can give you one of the following:

  * A replacement passport that will let you finish your trip 
  * An emergency travel document that will get you home 

**Keep copies of your documents**

It may be useful to have an image of your passport on your phone or carry a
photocopy of your passport when travelling. Consider emailing your documents
to yourself and a friend to keep a record.

You can read more in our page on [ renewing an Irish passport ](/en/travel-
and-recreation/passports/renewing-an-irish-passport/) .

##  What happens if my passport is lost or stolen?

If your passport is lost or stolen, **the passport is no longer valid for
travel** and the details are reported to Interpol.

If you find your passport after reporting it as lost or stolen, do not travel
on it.

You should report it to the Gardaí to protect yourself from identity fraud.

Losing the passport may reduce the length of time that your next passport is
valid. If you have lost 2 or more passports, you may not get a full 10-year
passport. It will depend on how many passports you have lost or had stolen. It
may take longer to process the application for your next passport.

Your passport may need to be valid for a certain amount of time before you can
enter a country. Contact your air carrier or travel agent or the [ embassy or
consulate of the country you are travelling to
](https://www.ireland.ie/en/dfa/embassies/) . You should do this in good time
before you travel as it may affect your plans.

##  Losing your Irish passport in Ireland

If you are an Irish citizen living in Ireland and you have lost your Irish
passport, or it has been stolen, you must:

  1. Let the Passport Office know immediately 
  2. Report the loss or theft to the [ Garda Síochána ](https://www.garda.ie/en/contact-us/station-directory/)

**Three ways you can renew your Irish passport**

  * Online, through [ Passport Online ](https://www.ireland.ie/en/dfa/passports/passport-online/)
  * By post, through [ Post Passport ](https://www.anpost.com/Government-Services/Passport-express) with An Post 
  * In person, through the [ Passport Office’s counter ](https://www.ireland.ie/en/dfa/passports/urgent-appointment/) service in Dublin and Cork. We explain the [ circumstances ](/en/travel-and-recreation/passports/renewing-an-irish-passport/) in which you can do this. 

**Emergency travel documents from Ireland**

If you don’t have a passport and need to travel abroad due to an emergency,
you should [ contact the Passport Service by webchat
](https://www.ireland.ie/en/dfa/passports/contact-us/) or by phone 01 671
1633.

Examples of such emergencies are:

  * A death or funeral of immediate family members abroad 
  * Urgent medical attention abroad 

##  Losing your Irish passport abroad

Losing your passport or having it stolen while abroad can be very stressful.
But there are 2 things you must immediately do.

**1.Make a police report**

Contact the local police and request a written statement that you have
reported the loss of your passport. The Passport Service will only provide you
with a new travel document with a police report.

**2.Contact your Irish embassy or consulate**

You should contact your [ nearest Irish embassy or consulate
](https://www.ireland.ie/en/dfa/embassies/) .

They may be able to give you:

  * A replacement passport that will let you finish your trip 
  * An emergency travel document that will get you home 

If you are currently in a country without Irish representation, you may
contact an embassy or consulate of another EU member state. Sometimes, the
embassy or consulate of another EU Member State may issue you with an [ EU
Emergency Travel Document (ETD)
](http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/justice_freedom_security/citizenship_of_the_union/l14010b_en.htm)
.

##  How to replace a damaged passport

If you are replacing a damaged passport, you may need to return the damaged
passport to the Passport Office.

You will need to do this if you are replacing:

  * An adult passport, which is still valid for another 12 months 
  * A child’s passport, which is still valid for another 6 months 

You may also need to resubmit [ supporting documents ](/en/travel-and-
recreation/passports/applying-for-or-renewing-an-irish-passport/) .

If your passport is damaged do not travel on it.
