##  Introduction

Your [ Irish passport ](/en/travel-and-recreation/passports/irish-passports-
an-overview/) is an important legal document.

Lost, stolen, or damaged passports can be [ renewed online
](https://www.ireland.ie/en/dfa/passports/passport-online/) . You can report
your passport as lost or stolen when you apply online for your new passport.

If you apply using the paper application form, fill out Section 6, explain how
your passport was lost, stolen or damaged and get it witnessed and stamped.

If you have lost your Irish passport abroad, you should first make a report to
the local police and then notify your nearest [ Irish embassy or consulate
](https://www.ireland.ie/en/dfa/embassies/) .

They can give you one of the following:

  * A replacement passport that will let you finish your trip 
  * An emergency travel document that will get you home 

**Keep copies of your documents**

It may be useful to have an image of your passport on your phone or carry a
photocopy of your passport when travelling. Consider emailing your documents
to yourself and a friend to keep a record.

You can read more in our page on [ renewing an Irish passport ](/en/travel-
and-recreation/passports/renewing-an-irish-passport/) .

##  What happens if my passport is lost or stolen?

If your passport is lost or stolen, **the passport is no longer valid for
travel** and the details are reported to Interpol.

If you find your passport after reporting it as lost or stolen, do not travel
on it.

You should report it to the Gardaí to protect yourself from identity fraud.

Losing the passport may reduce the length of time that your next passport is
valid. If you have lost 2 or more passports, you may not get a full 10-year
passport. It will depend on how many passports you have lost or had stolen. It
may take longer to process the application for your next passport.

Your passport may need to be valid for a certain amount of time before you can
enter a country. Contact your air carrier or travel agent or the [ embassy or
consulate of the country you are travelling to
](https://www.ireland.ie/en/dfa/embassies/) . You should do this in good time
before you travel as it may affect your plans.

passport, or it has been stolen, you must:

  1. Let the Passport Office know immediately
