#  Sharing of intimate images without consent

  * Introduction 
  * What is an intimate image? 
  * Offences 
  * Further protection for alleged victims 
  * Who to contact 

##  Introduction

Since 9 February 2021, new laws apply to the sharing of intimate images
without the consent of the person in the images. If you record, distribute or
publish intimate images without the permission of the person featured in the
images (sometimes called the subject of the images), you are guilty of an
offence.

Depending on your intent in sharing the images, you can face a maximum prison
sentence of up to 7 years. Protections have been put in place to ensure that
the alleged victim is not further harmed or embarrassed during any
prosecution.

##  What is an intimate image?

Intimate images are broadly defined in the [ Harassment, Harmful
Communications and Related Offences Act 2020
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2020/act/32/enacted/en/print.html) , also
known as “Coco’s Law”.

Intimate images include any photograph or video of:

  * A person’s genitals, buttocks or anal region (and, in the case of women, their breasts) 
  * The underwear covering these parts of the body 
  * A naked person 
  * A person engaged in any form of sexual activity 

##  Offences

There are 2 separate criminal offences for the making or sharing of intimate
images that cause harm. Harm can take many forms but includes anything which
seriously interferes with the victim’s peace or privacy, or which causes alarm
or distress.

###  1\. Intent to cause harm

The first, more serious offence is distributing, publishing or threatening to
distribute or publish an intimate image without consent and with the intent to
cause harm or being reckless as to whether harm is caused (knowing but not
necessarily intending for harm to be caused). This is sometimes known as
revenge porn.

If you are [ found guilty of this offence ](/en/justice/criminal-law/criminal-
trial/sentence/) , you can be sentenced to a [ class A fine
](/en/justice/criminal-law/criminal-trial/fines-for-criminal-offences/) or a [
maximum prison term ](/en/justice/criminal-law/criminal-trial/types-of-
sentences/) of 12 months or both in the [ District Court ](/en/justice/courts-
system/district-court/) . More serious versions of the offence can be
prosecuted in the [ Circuit Court ](/en/justice/courts-system/circuit-court/)
such as where a large number of intimate images are released or where the
intimate images are shared to a wide audience. If you are found guilty of this
offence in the Circuit Court, you can be sentenced to an unlimited fine or
maximum prison term of 7 years or both.

###  2\. No specific intent to cause harm

The second, less serious offence is recording, distributing or publishing an
intimate image without consent even if there was no specific intent to cause
harm. This offence would cover situations such as sharing intimate images of
someone you do not know.

For example, you may receive an intimate image of a person you do not know in
a social media message. If you republish that image without the permission of
the subject, you could be liable for prosecution under this offence, even if
you did not intend to cause harm to the person in the image.

If you are found guilty of this offence, you can be sentenced to a class A
fine or a maximum prison term of 12 months or both in the [ District Court
](/en/justice/courts-system/district-court/) .

###  Prosecution of children

Any prosecution of a child under 17 years of age under the Act can only be
brought with the consent of the [ Director of Public Prosecutions
](https://www.dppireland.ie/) .

##  Further protection for alleged victims

If a person is prosecuted for these criminal offences, the alleged victim is
granted anonymity - this means that they cannot be named or identified.

Unless a court allows the publication of the identity of the alleged victim,
any person who names or publishes any information likely to identify the
alleged victim may also be prosecuted for a criminal offence.

If you are found guilty of the offence of identifying an alleged victim, you
can be sentenced to a class B fine or maximum prison term of 12 months or both
in the District Court. If you are found guilty of this offence in the Circuit
Court, you can be sentenced to an unlimited fine or a maximum prison term of 3
years or both.

##  Who to contact

report the matter to [ an Garda Síochána ](/en/justice/law-enforcement/garda-
siochana-national-police-force/) , the national police force.
