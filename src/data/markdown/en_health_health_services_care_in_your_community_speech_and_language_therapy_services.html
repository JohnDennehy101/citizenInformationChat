##  What is speech and language therapy?

If you have difficulty with your communication, speech, language, fluency, or
voice, you can be assessed by a speech and language therapist. They may be
able to diagnose and treat you. Speech and language therapists can also help
you with eating, drinking and swallowing (also called Dysphagia). [ Read about
what a speech and language therapist does.
](https://www2.hse.ie/services/disability/childrens-services/services/speech-
and-language-therapy/)

Speech and language therapy is available in many places, including local
health centres, hospitals and schools. You can get speech and language therapy
services in the public health service from the Health Service Executive (HSE).
You can also get private speech and language therapy services.

##  Can I get speech and language therapy?

###  Children

If your child needs speech and language therapy, they may be referred to your
local Children's Disability Network (CDNT). Read more about how to get a
referral for your child below. You can [ read information from the HSE on
speech and language therapy for children.

and-language-therapy/)

support/useful-websites/) .

###  Adults

If you have communication difficulties, you may be able to get speech and
language therapy services through your [ Local Health Office
](https://www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/1/lho/) , or voluntary organisations
working on contract for the HSE. You may need speech and language therapy
after a stroke, accident or a progressive neurological disorder.

##  How much does speech and language therapy cost?

You can get free speech and language therapy services from the public health
service (HSE).

You must pay for any services you get from a private Speech and Language
therapist. However, you may be able to claim [ tax relief on medical expenses
](/en/health/health-system/registration-of-health-and-social-care-
professionals/) .

##  How to apply for speech and language therapy

####  Applying through the public healthcare system (HSE)

Contact your [ Local Health Office
](http://www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/1/LHO/) for information on what services
are available for you in your area.

Your family doctor (GP) can refer your child to [ your local Children’s
Disability Network Team ](https://www2.hse.ie/services/disability/childrens-
services/services/find-a-cdnt/) (CDNT). You can also [ make this referral
yourself ](https://www2.hse.ie/services/disability/childrens-
services/services/referral/) .

After you apply, there may be a waiting list for speech and language therapy.
The demand for services in your area and the needs of you or your child will
decide how long you are waiting.

####  Applying through the private healthcare system

If you want private speech and language therapy, you can contact the therapist
directly. Check the Independent Speech-Language Therapists in Ireland (ISTI) [
list of member therapists in private practice ](https://isti.ie/find-a-
therapist/) .

](/en/health/health-system/registration-of-health-and-social-care-
professionals/) , which keeps a [ register of therapists
](https://system.coru.ie/index.php/SearchMember/Find) .

The [ Irish Association of Speech and Language Therapists (IASLT)
](http://www.iaslt.ie/) is the professional association of speech and language
therapists in Ireland.

organisations, for example, support groups for stammering, stroke or
