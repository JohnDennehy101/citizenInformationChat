##  Introduction

Learning to drive and passing your test is an important personal achievement.
This page aims to provide practical guidance and advice on learning to drive
in Ireland. It includes information on the 4 key steps you must complete to
get a full Irish driving licence.

The steps to learning to drive are:

  1. Pass the driver theory test 
  2. Get a learner permit 
  3. Practice driving 
  4. Pass the driving test 

Driver testing in Ireland is carried out by the [ Road Safety Authority (RSA)
](https://www.rsa.ie/en/) . The [ National Driver Licencing Service (NDLS)
](https://www.ndls.ie/index.php) is the body responsible for issuing learner
permits and driver licences.

##  Step 1: Pass the driver theory test

The first step to learning to drive in Ireland is to pass the [ driver theory
test ](/en/travel-and-recreation/motoring/driving-tests/driver-theory-test/) .

The theory test is a computer-based examination of motoring rules and
practices appropriate to the [ category of vehicle ](/en/travel-and-
recreation/motoring-1/driving-tests/driver-theory-test#lcfd4d#lcfd4d) (car,
work vehicle, bus, truck, motorcycle or moped) you want to be licenced to
drive.

The driver theory test checks your knowledge of:

  * The [ rules of the road ](https://www.rsa.ie/services/learner-drivers/resources/rules-of-the-road)
  * Risk perception 
  * Eco-driving 
  * Hazard awareness 
  * Safe driving behaviour 

There are [ 3 things you must do ](https://theorytest.ie/book-your-theory-
test/driver-theory-test-car-bike-bus-or-truck/) to complete this step:

  1. **Revise official RSA material.** You should use the official revision materials to increase your chance of passing the test the first time. You can buy online learning subscriptions, books and CD-ROMs on the [ theory test website ](https://dttstore.prometric.com/) . You can also buy the [ official Learning App ](https://theorytest.ie/learning-app/) on the App Store (IOS devices) or on Google Play (Android). 
  2. **Book a test.** You can [ book and pay for your driver theory test online. ](http://www.theorytest.ie/driver-theory-test/schedule-test/) You can take the test at [ centres throughout Ireland (pdf) ](https://theorytest.ie/wp-content/uploads/theory-test-ireland-test-centre-location-map-051017.pdf) . The test is offered in many languages, including Sign Language (ISL) and candidates with special needs [ are catered for ](https://theorytest.ie/general-information/test-day-assistance-support/) . See the [ RSA driver theory test FAQs ](https://theorytest.ie/general-information/faqs/) for more information. 
  3. **Provide appropriate ID.** The RSA has published a list of [ acceptable forms of identification ](https://theorytest.ie/id-policy-update/) you must show on the day of your theory test to be able to take the exam. You will not be allowed to take your exam and you will lose your test fee if you do not have correct identification. 

You can read about what the theory test involves, [ how to book a test
](/en/travel-and-recreation/motoring-1/driving-tests/driver-theory-
test#l82814) and how to prepare for it in our [ Driver theory test
](/en/travel-and-recreation/motoring/driving-tests/driver-theory-test/) page.

###  Costs

The following table outlines the cost of driver theory tests:

Driving licence category  |  Cost   
---|---  
BW (car/tractor & work vehicles) or AM (motorcycle/moped)  |  €45   
C (truck) or D (bus)  |  €72   
C (truck) and D (bus) combined  |  €84   
  
The fee for making an appeal is €15, which is refunded if it is successful.

##  Step 2: Get a learner permit

When you pass your theory test, you should [ apply to the NDLS for a learner
permit ](https://www.ndls.ie/how-to-apply/learner-permit.html) . A learner
permit allows you to learn to drive on public roads in Ireland and you must
always have it with you when you are driving.

You cannot take driving lessons without a valid learner permit and, in most
cases, you cannot take a driving test until you have had your first learner
permit for [ at least 6 months. ](https://www.rsa.ie/en/RSA/Learner-
Drivers/Safe-Driving1/6-Month-Rule/)

###  How to apply

Before applying for a learner permit, you need to make sure you are eligible
to learn to drive in Ireland and have the documentation you need. To apply for
a learner permit for any vehicle, you must:

  * [ Be normally resident in Ireland ](https://www.ndls.ie/about-the-learner-permit)
  * [ Meet the minimum age requirement ](/en/travel-and-recreation/motoring/driver-licensing/categories-of-motor-vehicles-and-minimum-age-of-drivers-in-ireland/)
  * Have a [ driver theory test pass certificate ](https://www.rsa.ie/services/learner-drivers/the-driving-test/after-you-pass-your-test) (dated within 2 years of issue) 

To apply for your first learner permit, you can [ apply online
](https://ndls.rsa.ie/) or in person at an [ NDLS centre
](https://www.ndls.ie/where-to-apply.html) . You must make an appointment
first if you are applying in person.

You must also have passed an eye test for driving. You must submit a
satisfactory eyesight report (dated within one month) with your first learner
permit application. The eyesight report must be completed by a registered
optometrist or medical practitioner. Read more on the [ NDLS website
](https://www.ndls.ie/medical-fitness/do-i-need-to-submit-an-eyesight-report-
form.html) .

You can find out [ what other documentation you will need to apply on the NDLS
website ](https://www.ndls.ie/how-to-apply/learner-permit.html) .

###  Cost

  * New learner permit and renewal applications - €35 
  * Category added or removed - €35 

###  Rules

**A learner permit is not a full driving licence** and you must keep to
several important restrictions when driving on a learner permit in any type of
vehicle. You must:

  * **Be accompanied when driving** . If you hold a learner permit for a car, truck or bus, you must be accompanied and supervised at all times by a qualified driver. A qualified driver is a person who has held a full driving licence in the same category for a continuous period of 2 years. If you hold a learner permit for a motorcycle, you must complete your [ Initial Basic Training (IBT) ](https://www.rsa.ie/en/RSA/Learner-Drivers/Motorcyclists/Initial-basic-training-IBT-for-motorcyclists/) before you can drive unsupervised (see ‘Practice Driving’ below for further information). 
  * **Display L plates.** Learner permit holders for all categories (except work vehicles) must display ‘L’ plates while they are driving. Learner permit holders for motorcycles must display ‘L’ plates on a yellow fluorescent vest that is clearly visible on the front and back of the driver’s body. 
  * **Stay off motorways** . As a learner permit holder, you are not permitted to drive on a motorway. 
  * **Not tow trailers** . Certain learner permit holders driving cars, trucks or buses must not tow a trailer. Read more about [ learner permits for trailers ](/en/travel-and-recreation/motoring-1/driver-licensing/learner-driving-permits-for-cars-and-work-vehicles#l7d405) . 
  * **Not carry passengers for payment** . As a learner permit holder, you must not carry any passenger for payment or reward. If you hold a learner permit for a motorcycle, you cannot carry any passengers until you pass your test. 
  * **Keep to disqualification thresholds** . As a learner permit holder driving any type of vehicle, you must keep to a [ reduced drink driving limit ](/en/travel-and-recreation/motoring/driving-offences/drink-driving-offences-in-ireland/) and [ penalty point disqualification ](/en/travel-and-recreation/motoring/driving-offences/penalty-points-for-driving-offences/) threshold. 

##  Step 3: Practice driving

Under the RSA’s [ Graduated Driver Licensing (GDL) scheme
](https://passthetest.ie/about-gdl/) , you must complete compulsory lessons
with an RSA Approved Driving Instructor (ADI) before you can take a test.

  * If you hold a learner permit for a car and light van, you must undergo [ Essential Driver Training (EDT) ](https://www.rsa.ie/en/RSA/Learner-Drivers/Driver-Training/Car-Training-EDT/)
  * If you hold a learner permit for a motorcycle, you must complete [ Initial Basic Training (IBT) ](https://www.rsa.ie/en/RSA/Learner-Drivers/Motorcyclists/Initial-basic-training-IBT-for-motorcyclists/)

However, these mandatory lessons alone will not prepare you for your test. [
RSA guidance (pdf) ](https://www.rsa.ie/docs/default-
source/services/s1.9-learner-driver-faqs/ldt_syllabus.pdf?sfvrsn=f6761d80_5)
is clear that you should practice driving as much as possible on all types of
roads and in all types of traffic situations with an ADI before arranging a
test. You can access [ details of ADIs ](http://www.rsa.ie/en/RSA/Learner-
Drivers/Finding-an-instructor/Find-an-instructor/) located across the country.

There is **no set cost** for EDT or IBT lessons and each driving instructor
determines their own price. You should shop around and compare the prices and
services offered by different ADIs to get the package that is best for you.

###  Essential Driver Training (EDT)

EDT is a training course that teaches fundamental driving skills to learner
car drivers. The RSA has published [ detailed guidance on EDT (pdf)
](https://www.rsa.ie/docs/default-source/services/s1.2-get-
qualified/essential-driver-training-a5-mar19-v4.pdf?sfvrsn=4f5a68f2_5) . The
course is made up of 12 individual 1 hour sessions.

At each EDT session, your ADI will check your learner permit and record the
session with a stamp and signature in your official EDT logbook. You must
produce [ your completed EDT logbook (pdf) ](https://www.rsa.ie/docs/default-
source/services/s1.2-get-qualified/edt-learner-logbook.pdf?sfvrsn=210f2346_5)
on the day of the driving test.

You can also [ nominate a sponsor ](https://www.rsa.ie/services/learner-
drivers/driving-lessons/car-driving-lessons-\(edt\)) to accompany you during
your EDT sessions. Your sponsor should be an experienced licence holder who
can support you in preparing for your test.

If you have a full driving licence from a country that does not have a [
licence exchange agreement ](/en/travel-and-recreation/motoring/driver-
licensing/exchanging-foreign-driving-permit/) with Ireland, you will only be
required to complete 6 EDT sessions before taking the Irish driving test. The
RSA has published a [ detailed handbook on Reduced EDT (pdf)
](https://www.rsa.ie/docs/default-source/services/s1.8-learner-driver-
resources/reduced-edt-information-booklet.pdf?sfvrsn=db5fc51e_0) .

###  Initial Basic Training (IBT) for motorcyclists

Once you have passed your theory test and obtained a motorcycle learner
permit, you cannot drive on a public road until you have completed your IBT.

IBT is a 16-hour mandatory training course, broken into [ 4 separate modules
](https://www.rsa.ie/services/learner-drivers/driving-lessons/motorcycling-
lessons-\(ibt\)) , that teaches basic riding skills to learner motorcyclists.
IBT courses are only available at [ RSA approved IBT training centres
](https://www.rsa.ie/services/learner-drivers/driving-lessons/motorcycling-
lessons-\(ibt\)) and may only be delivered by [ RSA approved IBT instructors
](https://www.rsa.ie/services/learner-drivers/driving-lessons/find-an-
instructor/ibt) .

You can read [ about what IBT involves (pdf)
](https://www.rsa.ie/docs/default-source/services/s1.8-learner-driver-
resources/initial-basic-training-\(ibt\).pdf?sfvrsn=d74e79bf_2) , including
the [ full syllabus (pdf) ](https://www.rsa.ie/docs/default-
source/services/s1.8-learner-driver-resources/cbt_initial-
_syllabus_sept_2010-review-2020.pdf?sfvrsn=ab66fe62_5) , and [ how to enrol on
an IBT course near you ](https://www.rsa.ie/services/learner-drivers/driving-
lessons/motorcycling-lessons-\(ibt\)) on the RSA’s webpage.

##  Step 4: Pass the driving test

Once you have completed your mandatory training and learned how to drive
safely and confidently, the next step is to apply for your driving test.

You can read about [ driver testing in Ireland ](/en/travel-and-
recreation/motoring/driving-tests/driving-test/) .

###  How to apply

You can [ apply and pay for your test online
](https://www.rsa.ie/en/RSA/Learner-Drivers/The-Driving-Test/Apply-online/) at
RSA.ie. You will need a debit or credit card and a valid email address.

Alternatively, you can [ download an application form for a driving test (pdf)
](https://www.rsa.ie/docs/default-source/services/s1.5-driving-test/rsa-
driving-test-application-form.pdf?sfvrsn=a48f8280_7) and apply by post. You
can also get a copy of the relevant form from your [ local Motor Tax Office.
](https://www.gov.ie/en/service/1fc151-find-your-local-motor-tax-office/)

Find out more about [ how to book a test ](/en/travel-and-
recreation/motoring-1/driving-tests/driving-test#l7b673) .

###  Cost

The following table outlines the cost of a driving test for different
categories of vehicles:

**Category of Vehicle** |  **Fee**  
---|---  
Categories A, A2, A1, B, BE, AM and W  |  €85   
All other categories  |  €120   
CPC Driving Test (Bus and Truck Category)  |  Part 1 - €120  Part 2 - €32   
  
###  What does the test involve?

A driving test is designed to make sure that you:

  * Know the [ Rules of the Road ](https://www.rsa.ie/services/learner-drivers/resources/rules-of-the-road)
  * Possess the knowledge and skill to drive competently in accordance with those rules 
  * Drive with proper regard for the safety and convenience of other road users 

The test lasts about 50 to 100 minutes, depending on traffic conditions and
the vehicle category. At the beginning of the test, you will be asked
technical questions about the rules of the road and the functionality of your
car. You may also be asked to point out different parts under the bonnet, such
as how to check oil levels, or which part is the engine.

You will then drive about 5 miles in a variety of road and traffic conditions
and will be examined on your practical skills.

The [ motorcycle test ](/en/travel-and-recreation/motoring-1/driving-
tests/driving-test#lb9fa2) is similar to the test for cars and work vehicles.
Read more about [ preparing for and taking a test ](/en/travel-and-
recreation/motoring-1/driving-tests/driving-test#lae1eb) .

###  Getting your result

When you return to the test centre, your examiner will bring you back into the
examination room to give you the result. [ If you pass
](https://www.rsa.ie/en/RSA/Learner-Drivers/The-Driving-Test/After-you-pass/)
, you will be given a Certificate of Competency, which is valid for 2 years.
Once you have this certificate, you can [ apply for a full driving licence
](/en/travel-and-recreation/motoring/driver-licensing/full-driving-licence/) .

The following table outlines the cost of driving licence applications:

**Licence type** |  **Fee**  
---|---  
New Driving Licences and Renewals  |  €55   
Three Year Licence (Age or Medical Grounds)  |  €35   
One Year Licence (Medical Grounds)  |  Free   
Replacement or Duplicate Licence  |  €35   
Exchange a Foreign Licence  |  €55   
  
If you fail your driving test, you will be given a detailed list of your
mistakes. You will need to apply for a new test through the online customer
portal [ MyRoadSafety ](https://myroadsafety.rsa.ie/home/login) . Once you’ve
reapplied for your car driving test, you will automatically be sent another
booking invitation 6 to 8 weeks after your failed test. This may take longer
in some centres with high demand. If you are not satisfied with the results of
your driving test, [ you can appeal ](https://www.rsa.ie/services/learner-
drivers/the-driving-test/repeating-your-test) .

To work as a professional truck or bus driver, you need a [ Driver Certificate
of Professional Competence (CPC) ](https://www.rsa.ie/services/professional-
drivers/cpc) . You can learn more about [ how to get a Driver CPC.
](/en/travel-and-recreation/motoring-1/driver-licensing/learner-driving-
