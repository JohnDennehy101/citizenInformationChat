##  Your right to complain

Online platforms like social media networks, host providers and online
marketplaces have become part of our daily lives.

However, sometimes online platforms can be misused to spread harmful or
illegal media such as hate speech, terrorist content or child sexual abuse
material (CSAM). They can also be abused to sell dangerous goods and
counterfeit products, or to offer illegal services, exposing users to harm.

Since 17 February 2024, you have the right to make a complaint against online
platforms if you:

  * See harmful or illegal content 
  * Need to report a violation of terms 
  * Have concerns about targeted ads 

In most cases, **you should first complain to the platform itself** and then
complain to [ Coimisiún na Meán ](https://www.cnam.ie/) if you believe the
platform has not met its obligations.

###  **Who can make a complaint?**

You can make a complaint as a:

  * Member of the public 
  * An organisation acting on behalf of a user 
  * Trusted flagger 

A trusted flagger is an organisation given special status based on its
expertise and competence in reporting illegal content such as [ the Irish
Network Against Racism ](https://inar.ie/hate-speech-monitoring/) .

Online platforms must prioritise complaints made by trusted flaggers.
Coimisiún na Meán has more information about [ trusted flaggers
](https://www.cnam.ie/dsaindustry/) .

##  What is the Digital Services Act?

The [ Digital Services Act (DSA)
](https://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2024/act/2/enacted/en) introduces new
rules to protect children and adults online. It makes online platforms more
responsible for the safety of their users by holding the platform accountable
for what they host.

Platforms must quickly identify and remove illegal and harmful content, giving
users more control over their online experience.

###  **What online platforms are covered?**

The table below explains the types of online platforms covered and examples of
commonly used platforms. There are links to where to complain for each
platform. Read more about ' [ How to complain to the platform
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/consumer/how-to-complain/complain-

###  **Who regulates online platforms?**

[ Coimisiún na Meán ](https://www.cnam.ie/) – Ireland’s media regulator – is
the Irish Digital Services Coordinator under the DSA and has powers to carry
out investigations and take enforcement actions.

Coimisiún na Meán is currently preparing a new [ Online Safety Code (pdf).
](https://www.cnam.ie/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Draft-Online-Safety-Code-
Public-Consultation-QA.pdf)

##  How to complain about harmful or illegal content

Online platforms must have a way for you to tell them about illegal content.
You can read more about [ what makes content illegal
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/consumer/buying-digital-content-and-
services/online-safety/#60a14d) .

###  **Report harmful or illegal content**

You can report harmful or illegal content to the online platform. The platform
must inform law enforcement if necessary.

If you tell them about something illegal, they must review it and act if they
agree it is illegal. They must do this quickly and tell you what they decide.

###  **What to include in your report**

Provide the following information in your report:

  * Explain the reasons why you believe the content is illegal 
  * The location of the content, such as the exact URL(s) 
  * Your name and email address, except in cases of content involving child sexual abuse material (CSAM) 
  * A statement confirming your honest belief that the contents of the report are accurate and complete 

###  **Immediate danger or risk of harm**

If you or someone else is in immediate danger or risk of harm, call emergency
services, for free, by dialling 112 from any phone.

If you want to report a crime or suspected criminal activity, contact An Garda
Síochána at your local station or call the free Garda Confidential telephone
number on 1800 666 111.

If you suspect a child is a victim of abuse or at risk, contact your local
Garda station or the free Garda Confidential line.

###  **What to expect after you report**

After reporting illegal content to the platform, you will receive confirmation
of your report from the platform, if you included your email.

If the platform identifies illegal content, they must act promptly to remove
or disable access.

You will be notified of their decision without delay. If the platform based
its decision using automation (without human input), they have to tell you how
they used automation. The platform must also give you information on how to
appeal their decision.

###  **If the content is not taken down**

Online platforms must act quickly on reports they receive. If the platform
does not delete the content or respond to you, you have options for redress
(ways to solve the issue).

The first step is to use the platform's internal complaint system within 6
months of the decision.

If you believe a provider has not met its obligations, you can make a
complaint to Coimisiún na Meán.

Read more on ‘How to complain to the platform’ and ‘How to take your complaint
further’ below.

Coimisiún na Meán has common questions and answers on [ reporting illegal
content ](https://www.cnam.ie/onlinecomplaints/) .

##  Concerns about targeted ads

Online platforms must:

  * Mark ads so you know you are seeing an ad 
  * Give you information on who is presenting the ad and who paid for it (if different) 
  * Give you reasons you were targeted for an ad and information on how you can change these settings 

Ads must not target certain personal data, including race, ethnic origin,
political opinion, membership in a trade union, religious or philosophical
beliefs, health data, your sex life, or sexual orientation.

###  **Ads shown to children and young people**

Online platforms that children can access must have appropriate and
proportionate measures to protect the privacy, safety, and security of
children using their services.

Services must not use profiling data to decide which ads to show children.
Profiling data is information about your preferences and interests from the
websites you visit, what you “like” or links you follow.

###  **Recommender systems**

Platforms can often use recommender systems to decide which content to show
users and in which order.

Recommender systems can be abused and manipulated to fuel dangerous
disinformation and propagate illegal content.

An online platform that uses recommender systems must explain how content is
being selected to be shown or recommended to you in its terms and conditions.

The explanation must include:

  * How content is selected 
  * Options for you to change or influence recommendations 

###  **Platform design concerns**

Platforms must not influence, deceive or manipulate users through their design
and online interface.

The platform must not:

  * Use deceptive design practices, for example, have pre-selected options 
  * Limit your freedom in choices 
  * Present you with false urgency messages or countdown timers 
  * Make it harder for you to cancel a subscription than to subscribe 

Coimisiún na Meán has common questions and answers on [ advertising, online
interfaces and recommender systems ](https://www.cnam.ie/onlinecomplaints/) .

If you believe a platform has not met its obligations, you can complain to
Coimisiún na Meán.

##  Your content or account was wrongfully restricted, blocked or suspended

An online platform can restrict the visibility of a user’s content if the
content is illegal or does not comply with the provider’s terms and
conditions. Restricting the visibility means they can:

  * Remove it 
  * Disable access to it 
  * Demote it (meaning it does not appear high up when searched or as a recommended video) 

###  **Terms and conditions**

Terms and conditions must explain the rules of the service use and any
restrictions that may be applied when the rules are breached.

Terms and conditions must include:

  * Information on any policies, procedures, measures, and tools used for content moderation 
  * Rules of procedure for its internal complaint handling system 

The terms and conditions must be easy to find, user-friendly, and easy to
understand. They must be publicly available in machine-readable format and
easy to access.

For sites mostly used by children under 18 (or minors), terms and conditions
must be explained in a way children can easily understand.

###  **Use of restrictions**

Online platforms must act diligently and objectively to apply these
restrictions. They must consider the rights and legitimate interests of all
parties involved. This includes the fundamental rights to:

  * Freedom of expression 
  * Freedom and pluralism of the media 

They must also consider other fundamental rights and freedoms enshrined in the
[ Charter of Fundamental Rights ](https://commission.europa.eu/aid-
development-cooperation-fundamental-rights/your-rights-eu/eu-charter-
fundamental-rights_en) .

If you believe an online platform has not met its obligations about its terms
and conditions, you can make a complaint to Coimisiún na Meán.

###  **Your content or account was restricted**

If your content or account was restricted, the online platform must give you
clear reasons, including:

  * An explanation of why the content is illegal 
  * Type of decision (for example removing or demoting it) 
  * How long the decision will last for 
  * Facts and circumstances of the decision (for example whether it arose from their own investigation or after a report of illegal content) 
  * What geographic area is affected 
  * If automation was part of the decision 
  * Clear and user-friendly information on your redress options 

###  **Dispute a platform's decision**

If you're not satisfied with a platform's decision, you should make a
complaint within 6 months from the date of the decision. Make sure your
complaint includes the necessary details for consideration.

See ‘How to complain to the platform’ below. If you are not satisfied, you can
complain to Coimisiún na Meán.

Coimisiún na Meán has common questions and answers on [ restrictions on
content or user accounts ](https://www.cnam.ie/onlinecomplaints/) .

##  How to complain to the platform

Online platforms must provide an easy-to-use, user-friendly way to make a
complaint. They must allow you to submit the necessary information for the
platform provider to consider your complaint. You must be able to submit your
complaint electronically and for free.

###  **Single point of contact**

Online platforms must assign an easy-to-access contact point. Communication
cannot be fully automated. Contact information must be easy to access and up
to date.

Coimisiún na Meán has [ links to some of the largest online platforms
](http://www.cnam.ie/vlops-vloses-contact-details) .

###  **How the platform must handle your complaint**

The platform must:

  * Handle your complaint diligently and in a timely, non-discriminatory, and non-arbitrary way (this means they must follow principles and the correct process) 
  * Notify you of their decision about your complaint and their reasons without delay 
  * Advise you of the options for redress if you are not satisfied 

If the platform does not have a proper complaint process or you can't find a
suitable contact, you can bring your complaint to Coimisiún na Meán. See more
below.

##  How to take your complaint further

You can make a complaint to Coimisiún na Meán by:

  * Email at [ usersupport@cnam.ie ](mailto:usersupport@cnam.ie)
  * Phone on 01 963 7755 (Monday to Friday 8am to 6pm) 

Make sure you have all the relevant information and documentation before
contacting Coimisiún na Meán.

###  **Information to include with your complaint**

You should include the following relevant information in your complaint:

  * The name of the online platform (including URL) 
  * Details of your communication with the platform, including initial report and appeal or complaint 
  * Details of your complaint, including the reasons why you believe the online service did not comply with its obligations under the Digital Services Act (DSA) 
  * URLs, screenshots, or any other evidence that will help your complaint 

Coimisiún na Meán strongly recommends sending as much information as you can
by email including relevant screenshots to ensure a full and timely response.

###  **How your complaint is handled by Coimisiún na Meán**

Coimisiún na Meán follows these steps.

  * **Acknowledge and check if valid:** They will acknowledge receiving the complaint and check it is valid. If it is not valid, they will explain why. 
  * **Initial assessment** : They will decide if they can handle it or if it must be handled by another public body. 
  * **Further assessment:** They decide what action to take. 

**Decisions Coimisiún na Meán can take**

Coimisiún na Meán can take the following decisions:

  * Serve a Compliance Notice on the online platform 
  * Further investigate the complaint 
  * Dismiss the complaint if they find it frivolous, vexatious, or not made in good faith or if the subject matter is trivial 
  * Any other action they think is appropriate 
  * Take no action 

They will notify you and the online platform of the decision.

###  **Appealing the decision**

There is no right to appeal Coimisiún na Meán’s decisions.
