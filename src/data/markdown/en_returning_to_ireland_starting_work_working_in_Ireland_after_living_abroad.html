  * Finding and getting a job

  * Your employment rights in Ireland

##  Introduction

If you are returning to Ireland after living abroad, or if you have never
worked in Ireland, you need to know how employment in Ireland works. This page
has information on your employment rights, where to look for a job, income tax
and childcare in Ireland.

If you are coming home with non-EEA family members, and they want to work in
Ireland, they must have [ permission to work
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/moving-country/working-in-
ireland/employment-permits/overview-employment-permits/) .

##  Finding and getting a job

Try to start your job search before you come home to Ireland. Some employers
hire people directly from overseas. You will need to:

  * prepare your [ CV (resumé) ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/employment/starting-work-and-changing-job/training-and-looking-for-work/finding-and-getting-a-job/#ff365e)
  * organise your references, and 
  * do some research on pay and conditions in Ireland. 

If you want to work in Ireland and your qualification is from another country,
you may need to get your qualification recognised in Ireland. You should get
your [ foreign qualification recognised
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/returning-to-ireland/education-and-
schooling/getting-your-foreign-qualification-recognised-in-ireland/) before
you apply for a job.

You can use the [ Jobs Ireland ](https://www.jobsireland.ie/#/home) website to
search for jobs, or visit our page ‘ [ Finding a job
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/employment/starting-work-and-changing-
job/training-and-looking-for-work/finding-and-getting-a-job/) ’ for
information on where to find work after living abroad.

##  Starting work and getting paid

Within 5 days of starting a new job, your employer should tell you in writing:

  * How much you’ll be paid and how often 
  * How many hours you are expected to work in a normal week 
  * How long your contract is for (only applies to temporary or fixed-term contracts) 

You have a right to get a [ payslip
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/employment/employment-rights-and-
conditions/pay-and-employment/pay-slip/) with every payment of your wages,
either when you get paid or shortly after.

The national minimum wage for people aged 20 or over in Ireland is €12.70 per
hour since 1 January 2024.

Learn more about [ pay and employment
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/employment/employment-rights-and-
conditions/pay-and-employment/) .

##  Paying tax on your income

When you work in Ireland, you pay tax and charges on your income through the
PAYE (Pay As You Earn) system. You normally pay [ Income tax
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/money_and_tax/tax/income_tax/) , [ Pay
Related Social Insurance (PRSI) ](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-
system/social-insurance-prsi/paying-social-insurance/) and [ Universal Social
Charge (USC) ](/en/money-and-tax/tax/income-tax/universal-social-charge/) .

When you start a new job, take the following steps to make sure you get paid
on time and avoid paying emergency tax:

  * Give your employer your PPS number 
  * Make sure you are registered for Pay As You Earn (PAYE) in [ myAccount ](https://www.ros.ie/myaccount-web/home.html) on the Revenue website 
  * Register your new job with Revenue’s Jobs and Pensions service [ in myAccount ](https://www.ros.ie/myaccount-web/sign_in.html) . (You only need to register your first job. If you change job, you don’t need to register your new job on myAccount). 

You can read more about the [ tax you pay as an employee in Ireland
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/money-and-tax/tax/income-tax/how-your-
tax-is-calculated/) .

If you are starting to work for yourself, read about the [ different tax rules
for self-employed people ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/money-and-
tax/tax/income-tax/taxation-of-self-employed-people/) .

##  Your employment rights in Ireland

If you haven’t worked in Ireland for a long time (or if you have never worked
here), then you should find out about your employment rights.

Your employment rights include:

  * [ A contract of employment ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/employment/employment-rights-and-conditions/contracts-of-employment/contract-of-employment/)
  * [ Breaks during working hours ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/employment/employment-rights-and-conditions/hours-of-work/work-breaks-and-rest-periods/)
  * [ The right to disconnect ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/employment/employment-rights-and-conditions/employment-rights-and-duties/employee-rights-and-entitlements/#45c681)
  * [ Leave from work ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/employment/employment-rights-and-conditions/employment-rights-and-duties/employee-rights-and-entitlements/#b0de02)
  * [ Equality in the workplace ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/employment/equality-in-work/equality-in-the-workplace/)
  * [ Minimum notice periods ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/employment/unemployment-and-redundancy/losing-your-job/losing-job-entitlements/#lf8760)
  * [ Redundancy and dismissal ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/employment/employment-rights-and-conditions/employment-rights-and-duties/employee-rights-and-entitlements/#c63f4b)
  * [ Requesting to work from home (remote working) ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/employment/employment-rights-and-conditions/health-and-safety/working-at-home/)

##  Childcare options in Ireland

If you have children and you need someone to take care of them while you are
at work, you have different [ childcare options
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/education/pre-school-education-and-
childcare/your-childcare-options/) , including:

  * Full day care 
  * Sessional services (such as Montessori or playschool) 
  * Childminders 

You may be able to get help with paying for childcare through the [ National
Childcare Scheme ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/education/pre-school-
education-and-childcare/national-childcare-scheme/) and the [ Early Childhood
Care and Education (ECCE) Scheme
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/education/pre-school-education-and-
childcare/early-childhood-care-and-education-scheme/) .

##  Help with finding work

If you are unemployed when you return to Ireland, you can access [ free local
employment services for jobseekers ](/en/social-welfare/unemployed-
people/employment-supports/) . Your local employment service (LES) or your
local Job Club can help you with writing a CV and cover letter. They can also
help with filling in job application forms and training in interview skills.

You can apply for a jobseeker's payment while you look for work, including:

####  Jobseeker’s Allowance

This is a [ means-tested payment ](/en/social-welfare/unemployed-
people/jobseekers-allowance/) given to unemployed people who are looking for
work.

####  Jobseeker’s Benefit

This is a payment given to unemployed people who are looking for work and who
have paid enough PRSI contributions. It is not means tested.

If you are applying for [ Jobseeker's Benefit ](/en/social-welfare/unemployed-
people/jobseekers-benefit/) and you need contributions you paid in another EU
or EEA country to help you qualify, then your last contribution must have been
paid in Ireland.
