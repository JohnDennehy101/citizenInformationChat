#  Cash income not included in the means test

  * What is a means test? 
  * Income from rent 
  * Cash income not included in the means test 
  * Compensation payments 
  * More information 

##  What is a means test?

If you are applying for a [ social assistance payment
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-
system/social-assistance-payments/social-assistance-in-ireland/) , you must
pass a ‘means test’. In the means test, the Department of Social Protection
(DSP) looks at all your sources of income, for example:

  * Cash income 
  * Employment 
  * Capital and 
  * Maintenance (except maintenance payments for children) 

However, some income is not counted when your means are assessed. This page
looks at cash income not included in the means test. You can find more
information on income not taken into account in our page on the [ means test
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-
system/means-test-for-social-welfare-payments/means-test/) .

##  Income from rent

You can get up to [ €14,000 per year for renting out a room in your own home
](https://www.gov.ie/en/press-release/4bf45-minister-humphreys-announces-
measures-to-remove-barriers-facing-social-welfare-customers-seeking-to-take-
in-tenants/) without it affecting your means-tested:

  * [ Weekly social assistance payment ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/social-assistance-payments/social-assistance-in-ireland/)
  * [ Supplementary Welfare Allowance ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/supplementary-welfare-schemes/supplementary-welfare-allow/)
  * [ Working Family Payment ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/families-and-children/working-family-payment/) . 

You should check if renting a room in your home will affect any other payments
you’re getting, such as [ Fuel Allowance
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/extra-social-welfare-
benefits/fuel-allowance/) .

###  **Do I qualify for the rent income disregard?**

The maximum income disregard is €269.23 a week (€14,000 per year). The person
renting a room in your home must use the room for a minimum of 28 consecutive
days. The income disregard will not apply if you are renting to an employee or
to your immediate family members.

Immediate family members are:

  * Your spouse, civil partner or partner 
  * Your child, or the spouse of your child 
  * Your parent, step-parent or parent-in-law 
  * Your sibling, including step-siblings or siblings-in-law 
  * Your grandparent or your grandchild 
  * Your aunt or uncle 
  * Your nephew or niece 

###  **If you get a** **pension**

Currently, if you are getting a State Pension (Non-Contributory) or a Widow's,
Widower's or Surviving Civil Partner's (Non-Contributory) Pension and would
otherwise be living alone, any income from rent (over €14,000 per year) is not
assessed.

###  **If you host people from Ukraine**

The [ Accommodation Recognition Payment
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/moving-country/ukrainian-refugees-in-
ireland/accommodation-recognition-payment/) for hosting refugees from Ukraine
is not assessed in the means test for a weekly social assistance payment,
Working Family Payment or Supplementary Welfare Allowance. However, it is
taken into account for the [ Additional Needs Payment ](/en/social-
welfare/supplementary-welfare-schemes/additional-needs-payment/) (excluding a
supplement).

##  Cash income not included in the means test

The [ Working Family Payment ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-
welfare/families-and-children/working-family-payment/) , [ Supplementary
Welfare Allowance ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-
welfare/supplementary-welfare-schemes/) (SWA) and [ Rent Allowance
](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/5a2ebe-rent-allowance-for-tenants-
