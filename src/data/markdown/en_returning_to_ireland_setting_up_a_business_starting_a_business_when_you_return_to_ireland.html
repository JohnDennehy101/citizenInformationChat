#  Starting a business when you return to Ireland

  * Introduction 
  * The ‘Back for Business’ programme 
  * Your guide to starting a business in Ireland 
  * Financial considerations 
  * More information 

##  Introduction

If you are returning to Ireland after living abroad, you may decide to work
for yourself, rather than for an employer. Your knowledge and skills gained
from life abroad can help you to succeed in the local economy.

This page has information on how to become a business-owner in Ireland,
including guidance on how to write a business plan, hire staff, and manage
your taxes.

If a non-Irish citizen is coming to Ireland to set up a business with you,
they may need to apply for permission first. Read about [ coming to set up a
business in Ireland as a non-EEA, UK or Swiss national
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/moving-country/working-in-
ireland/migrant-workers/coming-to-set-up-a-business-in-ireland/#lac4a4) .

##  The ‘Back for Business’ programme

Back for Business is a free development programme to help Irish citizens who
have returned to Ireland to develop a business. The programme is funded
through the [ Emigrant Support Programme ](https://www.dfa.ie/global-
irish/support-overseas/emigrant-support-programme/) by the Department of
Foreign Affairs.

Visit our page about [ the Back for Business programme
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/returning-to-ireland/setting-up-a-
business/back-for-business-programme/) .

##  Your guide to starting a business in Ireland

entrepreneur for the first time, you can read the following information about
starting a business in Ireland:

example, your tax responsibilities will change. You might also need a start-up
grant or want to hire employees.
