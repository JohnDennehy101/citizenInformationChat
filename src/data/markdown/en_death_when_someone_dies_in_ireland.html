##  Introduction

This page is a guide to some of the practical concerns you may have when
someone close to you dies. It answers questions you may have on accessing
money, getting help with funeral expenses, dealing with your loved one’s
estate, and other practical issues you may be worried about.

Bereavement can be overwhelming and you may be going through many different
emotions. Don’t be afraid to ask for help if you need it. You will find a list
of organisations that can support you and your family at the end of this page.

##  Registering a death

Every death in Ireland must be [ recorded and registered
](/en/death/practical-arrangements-after-a-death/registering-a-death/) at a
civil registration office. You should register the death as soon as possible.
It must be registered within 3 months. You need a death notification form,
which you can get from the doctor who attended the person. Normally, a close
family relative registers the death. If there are no relatives available to do
this, the death can be registered by anyone who has knowledge of the death.

If the death was sudden or unexplained, the [ coroner ](/en/death/sudden-or-
unexplained-death/coroners/) may be appointed to [ hold an inquest
](/en/death/sudden-or-unexplained-death/inquests-and-inquest-reports/) about
the circumstances surrounding the death. A [ post-mortem examination
](/en/death/sudden-or-unexplained-death/postmortems/) may be carried out to
establish the cause of death.

More information about [ registering a death ](/en/death/practical-
arrangements-after-a-death/registering-a-death/) .

##  Who should I notify about the death?

You should tell a number of State institutions that the person has died. If
the person was getting a State pension or another social welfare payment, you
must [ inform the Department of Social Protection (DSP) ](/en/social-
welfare/death-related-benefits/social-welfare-payments-following-a-death/)
that they have died. You must also inform the DSP if you were getting [
Carer’s Allowance ](/en/social-welfare/carers/carers-allowance/) or [ Carer’s
Benefit ](/en/social-welfare/carers/carers-benefit/) for looking after them.

Telling other people that someone close to you has died can be very difficult.
You can ask a friend or family member to help you to contact the person’s
friends, work colleagues and family. It is customary to place a notice in a
local or national newspaper when a death has taken place to let people know
about it. This is now often done online through services like [ RIP.ie
](https://rip.ie/) . Your funeral director can help you with this.

##  Funeral arrangements and costs

One of the first things you have to do after the death is to make [ funeral
arrangements ](/en/death/practical-arrangements-after-a-death/funeral-
arrangements-and-costs/) . An undertaker or funeral director can deal with
most aspects of the funeral. The Irish Association of Funeral Directors (IAFD)
has a [ list of funeral directors ](https://www.iafd.ie/members) . There is a
[ code of practice ](https://www.iafd.ie/code-of-practice) that explains what
you can expect from its members.

If the person died in hospital, their body will be brought to the hospital
mortuary until funeral arrangements are made. You can choose to bring them
home or have them brought to a funeral home.

The person may have left instructions in their will about the type of funeral
they wanted, where they wanted their remains laid to rest and if they wanted a
religious or non-religious funeral service.

You may prefer a small private funeral or you may feel a large funeral is more
appropriate. In general, this is a personal choice that you and your family
should make.

###  Funeral costs

In some cases, a funeral may be partially or fully paid for in advance, or the
funeral costs are covered by an insurance policy. Otherwise, the person who
arranges the funeral must pay the funeral director for the cost of the
funeral. This can be repaid from the deceased’s estate (the money and property
the person left behind).

If you have difficulty paying for the funeral you can [ apply for help from
the Department of Social Protection ](/en/social-welfare/supplementary-
welfare-schemes/additional-needs-payment/) .

##  Help with money

For many people, the loss of a loved one can lead to a reduction in the amount
of money that is available to support you and your family. You may be entitled
to [ help from the Department of Social Protection ](/en/social-welfare/death-
related-benefits/benefits-and-entitlements-following-a-death/) .

If your deceased spouse or civil partner made a will, you have an automatic
right to a share in the estate, which is called a ‘ [ legal right share
](/en/birth-family-relationships/married-couples/marital-status-and-
inheritance#l681ca) ’. If you are separated your inheritance rights may have
been renounced or extinguished. If you are divorced from the person who died,
or your civil partnership was dissolved, you [ no longer automatically inherit
from the estate ](/en/birth-family-relationships/separation-and-
divorce/succession/) .

Cohabiting couples in Ireland have no automatic right of inheritance when
their partner dies, but you can apply to the courts so you will be provided
for

###  Tax

There are special arrangements for income tax in the year of death and you may
be [ entitled to some tax credits ](/en/money-and-tax/tax/income-tax-credits-
and-reliefs/income-tax-credits-and-reliefs-following-a-death/) .

If you get an inheritance following a death, you may have to pay tax on it.
This is a type of [ Capital Acquisitions Tax (CAT) ](/en/money-and-
tax/tax/capital-taxes/capital-acquisitions-tax/) and must be paid by the
person who receives the inheritance. The amount of tax you have to pay depends
on the value of the inheritance and the relationship between you and the
person who has died. If you get an inheritance from your spouse or civil
partner, you do not have to pay CAT.

  * [ What happens to debts after death? ](/en/money-and-tax/personal-finance/debt/debts-after-death/)

##  Legal issues

You must get a legal document to give you the authority to administer the
deceased person’s estate. This is a legal order called a [ Grant of
Representation ](/en/death/the-deceaseds-estate/dealing-with-the-deceaseds-
estate#l4c8af) .

If the deceased person left a will, the person who deals with the estate is
called the deceased person’s executor. The executor needs to take out probate.
Taking out probate means having the [ Probate Office
](https://www.courts.ie/probate) or the appropriate District Probate Registry
certify that:

  * The will is valid 
  * All legal, financial and tax matters are in order 

Wills only take effect when the Probate Office accepts that the will is valid.
The Probate Office may make some enquiries before making its decision, for
example, it may ask for a sworn affidavit from one or both witnesses

If there is no will, the person who deals with the deceased person’s estate is
called an ‘administrator’. An administrator may also be appointed if there is
a will but:

  * No executor has been appointed 
  * The appointed person cannot act as executor 
  * The executor cannot or will not carry out their duties 

The administrator needs to take out a [ Letter of Administration
](/en/death/the-deceaseds-estate/dealing-with-the-deceaseds-estate#l56c52) (or
a Letter of Administration with Will Annexed if there is a will).

##  Help and support

Talking to someone you trust about your feelings of loss can be a great
support at this time. But sometimes family and friends may be unable to help.

feelings of grief. Often, just getting reassurance can help.
