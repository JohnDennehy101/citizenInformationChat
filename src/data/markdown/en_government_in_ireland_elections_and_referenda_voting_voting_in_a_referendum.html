  * How voting in a referendum works 
  * Voting at a polling station 
  * Voters with disabilities 
  * Voting by post 
  * Voting at hospitals and nursing homes 
  * Further information 

##  Can I vote in a referendum?

To vote in a referendum, you must be:

  * An Irish citizen 
  * At least 18 years old 
  * [ Registered to vote ](/en/government-in-ireland/elections-and-referenda/voting/registering-to-vote/)

In general, you vote at a polling station near your home address, but there
are some exceptions – for example, you may qualify to be on the [ Postal
Voters list ](/en/government-in-ireland/elections-and-
referenda/voting/registering-to-vote#l5150c) or the [ Special Voters List
](/en/government-in-ireland/elections-and-referenda/voting/registering-to-
vote#l5150c) .

##  How voting in a referendum works

The same constituencies that are used for a [ Dáil election ](/en/government-
in-ireland/elections-and-referenda/types-of-elections-and-referendums/the-
general-election/) are generally used for a referendum. The polling period
must be at least 12 hours between 7am and 10.30 pm on polling day.

You must vote in your local polling station. If you have a disability that
means that you cannot use your local polling station, you can apply to vote in
another polling station that is accessible for you.

There are special arrangements for people who are on the Postal Voters list or
the Special Voters List – see below.

###  Polling card

Before the referendum date, you will get a polling card.

This card includes:

  * Your elector number 
  * The name of the polling station where you will go to vote 
  * A formal statement explaining what the referendum is about 

##  Voting at a polling station

On the day of the referendum, you should go to the polling station named on
your polling card.

You will need to show a valid form of personal identification. Your polling
card is not a valid form of identification.

You can use the following documents to prove your identity:

  * A [ passport ](/en/travel-and-recreation/passports/) (either a passport card or passport book) 
  * A [ driving licence ](/en/travel-and-recreation/motoring/driver-licensing/)
  * A workplace identity card (it must have a photograph) 
  * A student identity card (it must have a photograph) 
  * A travel document (it must have a photograph) 
  * A [ Public Services Card ](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/public-services-card/)
  * A bank or credit union account book with your name and address in the constituency 

If you do not have any of the documents listed above, you can use one of the
following, along with evidence of your address in the constituency:

  * A cheque book or card 
  * A credit card 
  * A birth or marriage certificate 

###  Ballot paper

Voting is by secret ballot.

The ballot paper contains short instructions on how to vote and details of the
referendum proposal. It asks whether you approve of the proposal.

You should mark "X" in either the "yes" or the "no" box on the paper, then
fold it and place it in a sealed ballot box.

Pencils will be provided, but you can bring your own pen or pencil if you
wish.

###  Prohibition on political activity at polling stations

Political activity is strictly prohibited at polling stations on polling day.
You cannot display or distribute campaign materials, or canvass in any form.

The prohibition also applies in the grounds of the polling station and within
50 metres of the entrance. It is in effect while polling is open and for half
an hour before and afterwards.

##  Voters with disabilities

If you are voting at a polling station, you may be helped to vote in one of 3
ways:

  * By companion voting 
  * By assistance from the presiding officer 
  * By using a [ tactile ballot paper template ](https://www.ncbi.ie/all-you-need-to-know-about-the-tactile-ballot-paper-template/) – which is available to allow voters with visual impairments to mark their ballot papers at a referendum 

Alternatively, you may qualify to vote by post or as a special voter – see
below.

You can read more about [ facilities for voters with disabilities.
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/government-in-ireland/elections-and-
referenda/voting/facilities-for-voters-with-disabilities/)

##  Voting by post

If you are registered as a [ postal voter ](/en/government-in-
ireland/elections-and-referenda/voting/registering-to-vote#l5150c) , you will
be sent the following documents before polling day:

  * A ballot paper 
  * A receipt for the ballot paper 
  * An envelope for the marked ballot paper and a larger envelope addressed to the returning officer 

The ballot paper must be posted – it cannot be handed to the returning
officer.

You must arrange to have your declaration of identity witnessed by a Garda
before marking the ballot paper.

##  Voting at hospitals and nursing homes

If you are living in a hospital, nursing home or similar institution and you
have a disability or illness that prevents you from going to the polling
station, you can vote at the hospital or nursing home if you are on the [
Special Voters List ](/en/government-in-ireland/elections-and-
referenda/voting/registering-to-vote#l5150c) .

A special presiding officer will call to you at the hospital or nursing home
to allow you to vote. They will be accompanied by a Garda, whose role is to
guard the ballot papers and to act as an independent witness.

The presiding officer will give you a declaration of identity, which they will
witness for you. You then mark the ballot paper in secret, place it in the
special envelope provided, and present it to the presiding officer.

If you need help with voting, the special presiding officer will provide it in
the same way as at a polling station.

website. ](https://www.refcom.ie/)
