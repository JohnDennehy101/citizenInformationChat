##  What is early childhood education?

Early childhood education generally means education before the start of formal
schooling, or before the age children must generally attend school. It covers
the period from birth to 6 years.

By law, children must attend school (or get an education) from the age of 6.
In practice, almost all 5-year-olds and about half of 4-year-olds attend
primary schools.

Early childhood education services include infant classes in [ primary schools
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/education/primary-and-post-primary-
education/going-to-primary-school/) and a range of [ childcare and pre-school
services ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/education/pre-school-
education-and-childcare/your-childcare-options/) .

Pre-school childcare services are [ regulated by Tusla, the Child and Family
Agency ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/education/pre-school-education-
and-childcare/regulation-of-childcare-services/) .

###  Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) Scheme

The [ Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) Scheme
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/education/pre-school-education-and-
childcare/early-childhood-care-and-education-scheme/) provides free early care
and education for children of pre-school age. In general, this is for 3 hours
per day, 5 days a week, over a certain number of weeks for children enrolled
in participating playschools.

The ECCE scheme is administered by the [ Department of Children, Equality,
Disability, Integration and Youth (DCEDIY)
](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/2459ee-early-childhood-care-and-education-
programme-ecce/) .

##  Department of Education's role in early education

The Department of Education's role in early childhood education focuses on
interventions for children who are disadvantaged or have special needs. The [
Early Years Education Policy Unit ](https://www.gov.ie/en/organisation-
information/e7cfc3-early-years-education-policy-unit/) of the DCEDIY work on
policy issues affecting early childhood care and education.

###  Infant classes in primary school

There is a special grant allocation to national schools to help buy equipment
and materials for infant classes in primary schools.

###  Early Start

The [ Early Start Programme ](/en/education/pre-school-education-and-
childcare/early-start/) is for children who are at risk of not reaching their
potential in school. It is a one-year scheme offered to pre-school children
(aged 3 to 4) in some schools in disadvantaged areas.

###  Children under 4 with special needs

Pre-school children do not have a specific right to education. However, they
are entitled to certain health services which are related to education.

[ Local Health Offices ](https://www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/1/lho/) and
voluntary bodies provide services for young children with severe or profound
disabilities.

Pre-school children with disabilities can get psychological services and
speech and language therapy services from [ Health Service Executive (HSE)
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/health/health-system/health-service-
executive/) , if they are assessed as needing these services. Children under
the age of 5 can get an [ Assessments
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/health/health-services/health-
services-for-people-with-disabilities/assessment-of-need-for-people-with-
disabilites/) of Need carried out under the Disability Act 2005.

From the age of 2, young children with visual or hearing impairment can use
the [ Visiting Teacher Service
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/education/primary-and-post-primary-
education/educational-supports/visiting-teacher-service/) of the Department of
Education.

There are a small number of special pre-school class units for children with
autistic spectrum disorders. These units are attached to primary schools.

####  **Supports to access ECCE**

The Access and Inclusion Model (AIM) helps children with disabilities to
benefit from quality early learning and care and to access the [ ECCE
programme ](/en/education/pre-school-education-and-childcare/early-childhood-
care-and-education-scheme/) .

When you have identified a pre-school for your child, your service provider,
in consultation with you, will consider what supports may be needed to ensure
your child’s participation in pre-school.

Where it is considered that your child needs additional support, your pre-
school service provider can apply, in partnership with you, for targeted
supports under AIM.

The [ AIM website ](https://aim.gov.ie/) provides [ information for parents
](https://aim.gov.ie/parents/) and [ frequently asked questions
](http://www.preschoolaccess.ie/faqs/) on supports available. Your local City
or County Childcare Committee will also be able to provide you with
information and guidance on AIM.
