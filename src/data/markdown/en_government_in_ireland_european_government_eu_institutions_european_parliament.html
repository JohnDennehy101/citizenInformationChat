##  Introduction

The European Parliament is part of the legislative, or law making, process in
the EU. It is based in Brussels, Luxemburg and Strasbourg.

Most [ proposed laws ](/en/government-in-ireland/european-government/eu-
law/how-eu-law-works/) must be approved by the European Parliament **and** the
[ Council of the European Union ](/en/government-in-ireland/european-
government/eu-institutions/council-of-the-european-union/) to become law.

The Parliament has 705 seats and [ elections to fill these seats
](/en/government-in-ireland/elections-and-referenda/types-of-elections-and-
referendums/european-elections/) are held in all member states every 5 years.
The European Parliament is the only directly elected body within the EU.

The number of MEPs Ireland has in the European Parliament will [ increase to
14 (currently 13) in the next European election
](https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/press-
room/20230911IPR04910/2024-european-elections-15-additional-seats-divided-
between-12-countries) in June 2024. The total number of MEPs in [ European
Parliament ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/government-in-
ireland/european-government/eu-institutions/european-parliament/) will
increase from 705 to 720.

##  The President and MEPs

The Parliament elects its own president, along with 14 vice-presidents for a
term of 2.5 years. The president represents the Parliament to other EU
institutions.

The number of MEPs for each member state is loosely based on the population of
the member state. No country can have fewer than 6 MEPs or more than 96 MEPs.
Ireland has 13 MEPs.

MEPs join groups, or can sit as independent MEPs. For a group to be
recognised, it must have at least 25 MEPs representing at least one quarter of
EU member states.

##  What does the European Parliament do?

The European Parliament has 3 roles:

  * It debates **legislation** . It can pass or reject laws, and it can also make amendments (but not in all cases). Laws must also be passed by the Council of the EU in order to become law. If the law is about EU budgets, the Parliament can only advise on it – it does not have the power to reject the law. You can read more about [ how EU laws are made ](/en/government-in-ireland/european-government/eu-law/how-eu-law-works/) . 
  * It **supervises** EU institutions and budgets. The president of the EU Commission must be approved by Parliament, and the Commission must answer written or oral questions during Question Time. 
  * It establishes an EU **budget** (along with the Council of the EU). 

Unlike most national parliaments, the European Parliament cannot initiate
legislation. The European Commission is the only EU institution with the power
to initiate (or start) new laws. The Parliament can ask the Commission to
initiate laws.

##  How do I access EU Parliament documents?

You can access the following information online:

  * [ Parliamentary Committees ](https://www.europarl.europa.eu/committees/en/parliamentary-committees.html) – specialist committees of MEPs scrutinise legislation before they are sent to the Parliament to be debated and voted on. 
  * [ Parliamentary delegations ](https://www.europarl.europa.eu/delegations/en/home) – these are groups of MEPs who meet with representatives of non EU countries to build closer relationships 
  * [ Parliamentary questions ](https://www.europarl.europa.eu/plenary/en/parliamentary-questions.html) – a database of PQs are available online 
  * Public documents are held online on the [ European Parliament’s public register ](https://www.europarl.europa.eu/plenary/en/parliamentary-questions.html)

##  How do I raise a concern with the European Parliament?

If you have an issue that you wish to bring to the attention of the
Parliament, you can either contact your local MEP, or petition the Parliament
