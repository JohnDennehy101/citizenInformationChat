##  Introduction

If you have special dietary and heating needs you may be able to get
additional weekly supplements under the [ Supplementary Welfare Allowance
](/en/social-welfare/supplementary-welfare-schemes/supplementary-welfare-
allow/) Scheme.

You must satisfy the specific requirements for each supplement - see 'Rules'
below.

##  Rules

###  Diet supplement

[ The diet supplement was discontinued for **new applicants** from 1 February
2014. ](https://www.gov.ie/en/service/1d4b07-dietary-supplement/)

However, people who were getting Diet Supplement before 1 February 2014 can
continue to keep the payment (for as long as they continue to be entitled to
the payment).

You are entitled to retain the diet supplement for a _prescribed diet,_ if
you:

  * Have a specified medical condition 
  * Meet the conditions for Supplementary Welfare Allowance (SWA) and 
  * Pass a means test 

To get a diet supplement, a hospital consultant or a hospital registrar must
certify:

  * That you or your [ adult dependant ](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/claiming-a-social-welfare-payment/claiming-an-increase-in-your-social-welfare-payment-for-an-adult-dependant/) or [ child dependant ](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/claiming-a-social-welfare-payment/claiming-and-increase-in-your-payment-for-a-child-dependant/) has been prescribed a diet because of a specified medical condition 
  * The type of diet prescribed 
  * How long you will need the prescribed diet. 

A **gluten-free diet** for an adult or a child aged 18 to 22 may be prescribed
by your family doctor (GP).

In the case of diet supplements, for example, for people with cystic fibrosis,
the [ long-term illness scheme ](/en/health/drugs-and-medicines/long-term-
illness-scheme/) book may be accepted as verification that such a diet has
been prescribed. The length of time for which the diet is being prescribed and
the type of diet must be stated.

###  Qualifying diets

The weekly cost of each prescribed diet is set by the Department of Social
Protection. The following diets qualify for the diet supplement:

**Qualifying prescribed diets** |  **Cost of diet, €**  
---|---  
Low-lactose, milk-free diet  |  65.43   
Gluten-free diet  |  68.43   
High-protein, high-calorie diet  |  71.43   
Altered consistencies (liquidised) diet  |  74.93   
  
###  Heating supplement

The heating supplement is an additional weekly payment to help with the cost
of heating your home. You may get a heating supplement, if you:

  * Can show you have extra heating needs because of your age, medical condition or disability 
  * Are living alone or only with a dependent adult or dependent children 
  * Satisfy a means test   

##  Rates

###  Adult diet supplement

The rate for a single person and lone parent is calculated as follows: The
diet cost as set by the Department of Social Protection, less one-third of
your social welfare payment at the **2007** rate = the diet supplement to be
paid to you. [ You can check the rates for 2007 in SW19 (pdf).
](https://assets.gov.ie/11117/6beb1ad2f51346f4ad6f27db1c473e59.pdf)

###  Example 1:

  * Paul is on a high-protein, high-calorie diet and is getting a One-Parent Family Payment. The Department of Social Protection has set the cost of this diet at €71.43. Take one-third of his social welfare payment (excluding any amount he is getting for a child dependant) from €71.43 to get the amount of diet supplement payable. (€71.43 - €61.93 (or one-third of his One Parent Family Payment at the 2007 rate) = €9.50 paid as diet supplement) 

The rate for a married or cohabiting couple is calculated as follows: The diet
cost as set by the Department of Social Protection less one-sixth of your
social welfare payment at the **2007** rate = the diet supplement to be paid
to you.

###  Example 2:

  * Mary is married and on a high-protein high-calorie diet and is getting Jobseeker's Allowance. The Department of Social Protection has set the cost of this diet at €71.43 . Take one-sixth of her social welfare payment (excluding any amount she is getting for a child dependant) from €71.43 to get the amount of diet supplement payable. (€71.43 - €51.52 (one-sixth of her Jobseeker's Allowance payment including an increase for her adult dependant at the 2007 rate) = €19.91 paid as diet supplement) 

###  People getting Rent or Mortgage Interest Supplement

If you are getting Rent Supplement or Mortgage Interest Supplement, the
Supplementary Welfare Allowance personal rate for 2007, and qualified adult
rate where applicable, is used to calculate the amount of diet supplement. In
assessing your means, any increases in social welfare payments for children
are not taken into account.

###  Child diet supplement

The diet supplement rates for a qualified child are as follows:

  * Low-lactose, milk-free diet = €3.50 
  * Gluten-free diet = €6.50 
  * High-protein, high-calorie diet = €9.50 
  * Altered-consistency (liquidised) diet = €13 

A child is considered to be a dependant if they are under 18, or are over 18
and under 22 and in full-time education.

###  Heating supplement

There is no fixed rate for heating supplement. The amount of heating
supplement you get is based on your need as assesed by your Community Welfare
Officer.

##  How to apply

You can get an application form for the heating supplement at your [ local
Community Welfare Service
](https://www.gov.ie/en/collection/cb07d7-supplementary-welfare-allowance-swa-
list-of-offices-administering-swa/) . The Community Welfare Officer can help
you fill in the form.

The diet supplement was discontinued for new applicants from 1 February 2014.

###  Appeals

If you are unhappy with the decision of a Community Welfare Officer on your
application, you can ask for an internal review to re-examine the decision.
You should try to submit as much additional information as possible to help
your case.

##  Where to apply

To get a heating supplement, apply to the CWO at your [ local Community
Welfare Service ](https://www.gov.ie/en/collection/cb07d7-supplementary-
welfare-allowance-swa-list-of-offices-administering-swa/) .
