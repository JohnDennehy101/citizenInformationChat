##  What is a financial product?

When you open a bank account, take out a loan or sign up to other financial
services, you are making a contract with the financial services company.

Just like other consumer contracts, there are certain parts of the contract
that the company can set. However, [ these terms and conditions
](/en/consumer/consumer-laws/terms-and-conditions/) must not go against your
consumer rights and they must not be unfair.

Financial services companies must deal with you in a fair, clear, and
professional way.

The [ Central Bank of Ireland (Central Bank)
](https://www.centralbank.ie/home) regulates financial services providers in
Ireland.

##  Who can sell financial products in Ireland?

A financial product can include a buying shares in a company, opening a bank
account, getting a loan or credit care or other financial service.

You should only deal with regulated financial service providers when you buy
financial products and services.

Regulated financial service providers are companies or individuals who are
either:

  * Authorised by the Central Bank 
  * Authorised in another EU member state to provide products and services to consumers in Ireland 

_Authorisation_ means that the company has a licence to provide financial
services in Ireland. The Central Bank monitors which companies and individuals
can enter the financial markets, making sure they meet certain standards
before they are authorised to provide products or services to consumers.

**Type of financial service company** |  **Type of financial products or service they offer**  
---|---  
Banks  |  Bank accounts, loans, overdrafts, savings, mortgages, deposits, credit cards, investments, insurance   
Insurance companies  |  Life insurance, pensions and general insurance (car, home, travel, pet) policies   
Investment management firms  |  Stocks, bonds, mutual funds   
Insurance and investment intermediaries (brokers and agents)  |  Advice and arrange products from insurance and investment companies   
Mortgage intermediaries (brokers)  |  Advice and arrange mortgage products from lenders   
Stockbrokers  |  Buy and sell stocks and other securities   
Collective investment schemes  |  An investment company, fund or trust used for collective investment by investors   
Credit unions  |  Bank accounts, savings, loans, overdrafts, mortgages   
Moneylenders  |  Short-term, high-cost loans   
Bureaux de change  |  Buy and sell foreign currency   
Other retail credit firms  |  Cash loans or indirect loans including hire purchase, personal contract plan and consumer hire agreements   
Credit servicing firms  |  Servicing loans that are sold on by a lender. Servicing includes collecting repayments, dealing with complaints and helping if you are in financial difficulty   
Debt management firms  |  Charge you to provide debt management services (assesigng your financial situation, giving advice to resolve your debt, negotiating with your creditors)   
Home reversion firms  |  Cash loans for a share of your home (home equity release)   
  
To make sure the company you are dealing with is authorised by the Central
Bank, you should check the [ register of authorised financial service
providers ](http://registers.centralbank.ie/) .

##  Rules that financial services companies must follow

There are rules in place to protect you when you are buying financial products
and services. These rules come from EU and Irish legislation and codes of
conduct developed by the Central Bank.

###  Prudential rules

_Prudential rules_ make sure companies are financially sound and safely
managed. Financial services companies must manage risk and hold enough capital
(or cash reserves) for its business needs. This is a basic level of protection
for consumers.

###  Conduct of business rules

Financial services companies must follow _conduct of business rules_ that make
sure you are treated fairly when you buy a financial product or service.

They must:

  * Act honestly, fairly and professionally 
  * Act in your best interest when providing products or services 
  * Give you the information you need to make informed decisions 
  * Correct errors and address any complaint you have speedily, efficiently and fairly 

The general conduct of business rules are set out in the [ Consumer Protection
Code. ](http://www.centralbank.ie/consumer/cpc/Pages/home1.aspx)

There are specific codes and legislation covering:

  * [ Switching your bank account ](/en/money-and-tax/personal-finance/banking/switching-your-bank-account/)
  * [ High cost credit ](/en/money-and-tax/personal-finance/loans-and-credit/moneylending-in-ireland/)
  * [ Mortgage arrears ](/en/housing/owning-a-home/mortgage-arrears/consumer-protection-codes-and-mortgages/)

##  How the Central Bank enforces the rules

The Central Bank can take action against companies that do not follow its
rules.

The Central Bank investigates and sanctions (punishes) regulated financial
services companies and individuals when they breach (break) the law.

For financial services companies, the sanctions can include:

  * A caution or reprimand 
  * Having their licence suspended or revoked (taken away) 
  * A fine of up to €10 million or 10% of company’s turnover 

An individual person can be sanctioned by a:

  * Caution or reprimand 
  * Disqualification from managing a regulated financial services company 
  * Fine of up to €1 million

does-the-central-bank-have) .
