##  What is deferring the State Pension (Contributory)?

The State Pension (Contributory) is paid to people from the age of 66 who have
enough [ (PRSI) contributions ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-
welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/social-insurance-prsi/social-insurance/) .
From January 2024, you can choose to start claiming your State Pension
(Contributory) anytime between the ages of 66 and 70.

Choosing a later start date is called deferring your pension. You can defer
your start date up until you turn 70.

###  Why would I defer the start date for my State Pension (Contributory)?

During deferral, you can continue to work and make PRSI contributions to:

  * Increase your personal rate of payment, or 
  * Meet the qualifying condition of 520 (10 years) contributions for [ State Pension (Contributory) ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/social-welfare-payments/older-and-retired-people/state-pension-contributory/) . 

This means that deferring your State Pension (Contributory) can help you to:

  * Qualify for State Pension (Contributory) if you didn't qualify at age 66 
  * Get a higher rate of State Pension (Contributory) than what you would have got at age 66 

##  Who can defer their State Pension (Contributory)?

If you were born on or after 1 January 1958, you can choose to claim the State
Pension (Contributory) anytime between the ages of 66 and 70.

Once you start claiming your State Pension (Contributory), you can no longer
choose to defer your pension claim, even if you keep working. This is because
you don’t pay PRSI once you start getting your pension.

##  Rates of deferred State Pension (Contributory)

If you choose to start claiming your pension between age 67 and 70, you may be
entitled to a higher rate of State Pension (Contributory).

Your rate of pension depends on the age you are when you start getting your
pension and your number of PRSI contributions. If you don’t qualify for the
maximum rate, you may get a reduced rate.

The table below includes maximum rates based on January 2024 rates of State
Pension (Contributory).

**Age when you start to claim** |  **Maximum rate** |  **Increase for qualified adult (under 66)** |  **Increase for qualified adult (66 and over)**  
---|---|---|---  
Age 66  |  €277.30  |  €184.70  |  €248.60   
Age 67  |  €290.30  |  €193.40  |  €260.30   
Age 68  |  €304.80  |  €203.00  |  €273.20   
Age 69  |  €320.30  |  €213.30  |  €287.10   
Age 70  |  €337.20  |  €224.60  |  €302.30   
  
You can also get an [ increase in your payment for child dependants (known as
an Increase for a Qualified Child or IQC)
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-
system/claiming-a-social-welfare-payment/claiming-and-increase-in-your-
payment-for-a-child-dependant/) .

###  **How many PRSI contributions can I make during deferral?**

During deferral, you can continue to make PRSI contributions to increase your
personal rate of payment, or meet the qualifying condition of 520 (10 years)
contributions for [ State Pension (Contributory).
](https://www.gov.ie/en/service/e6f908-state-pension-contributory/)

However, you will not be able to increase your contributions past the current
maximum of 2080 (40 years).

###  **Check your contribution record**

It is important to know how many contributions you have before you choose the
start date for your pension.

The Department of Social Protection has a record of your contributions. You
can [ ask for a copy of your Contribution Statement on MyWelfare.ie
](https://services.mywelfare.ie/en/topics/statements-refunds-and-repayments/)
. This statement includes all your PRSI contributions, including paid PRSI
contributions and [ Long-Term Carers Contributions
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-
system/social-insurance-prsi/long-term-carers-contributions/) . You need a
verified MyGovID account to use this service.

Go to Gov.ie to find out [ how to use your contribution record to calculate
your State Pension (Contributory)
](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/b6193-how-to-calculate-your-state-pension-
contributory-rate/) .

##  How to defer your State Pension (Contributory)

You should apply for the State Pension (Contributory) no more than 6 months
before the date you want your pension to start. If you apply after the date
you wanted your pension to start, it can be backdated up to 6 months only.

The Department of Social Protection has published [ a new application form for
State Pension (Contributory) (SPC1) ](https://www.gov.ie/en/form/9b3ec-state-
pension-contributory-application-form-spc1/) . It asks for the date you want
to start getting your pension. This can be from your 66th birthday, or any
date between your 66th and 70th birthdays.

##  Can I get a social welfare payment during the deferral period?

If you defer claiming your State Pension (Contributory) up to the age of 70,
and you meet the other qualifying conditions for the payment, you can get:

  * [ Illness Benefit ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/disability-and-illness/illness-benefit/)
  * [ Partial Capacity Benefit ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/disability-and-illness/partial-capacity-benefit/) (only if you came to PCB from Illness Benefit) 
  * [ Jobseeker’s Benefit ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/unemployed-people/jobseekers-benefit/)
  * [ Jobseeker's Benefit (Self-Employed) ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/unemployed-people/jobseekers-benefit-self-employed/)
  * [ Back to Work Family Dividend ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/families-and-children/back-to-work-family-dividend/)

If you are already getting one of these payments when you defer your pension,
you can continue getting it for as long as you’re entitled to it.

###  **Voluntary contributions**

If you defer your State Pension (Contributory) and are aged under 70, you can
apply to make [ voluntary social insurance contributions
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-
system/social-insurance-prsi/voluntary-prsi-contributions/) if you:

  * Are no longer employed or a self-employed contributor, and 
  * Have at least 520 contributions
