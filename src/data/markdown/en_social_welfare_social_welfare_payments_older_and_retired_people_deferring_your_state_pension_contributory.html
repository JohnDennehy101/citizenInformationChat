##  What is deferring the State Pension (Contributory)?

The State Pension (Contributory) is paid to people from the age of 66 who have
enough [ (PRSI) contributions ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-
welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/social-insurance-prsi/social-insurance/) .
From January 2024, you can choose to start claiming your State Pension
(Contributory) anytime between the ages of 66 and 70.

Choosing a later start date is called deferring your pension. You can defer
your start date up until you turn 70.

###  Why would I defer the start date for my State Pension (Contributory)?

During deferral, you can continue to work and make PRSI contributions to:

  * Increase your personal rate of payment, or 
  * Meet the qualifying condition of 520 (10 years) contributions for [ State Pension (Contributory) ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/social-welfare-payments/older-and-retired-people/state-pension-contributory/) . 

This means that deferring your State Pension (Contributory) can help you to:

  * Qualify for State Pension (Contributory) if you didn't qualify at age 66 
  * Get a higher rate of State Pension (Contributory) than what you would have got at age 66 

##  Who can defer their State Pension (Contributory)?

If you were born on or after 1 January 1958, you can choose to claim the State
Pension (Contributory) anytime between the ages of 66 and 70.

Once you start claiming your State Pension (Contributory), you can no longer
choose to defer your pension claim, even if you keep working. This is because
you don’t pay PRSI once you start getting your pension.

##  Rates of deferred State Pension (Contributory)

If you choose to start claiming your pension between age 67 and 70, you may be
entitled to a higher rate of State Pension (Contributory).

Your rate of pension depends on the age you are when you start getting your
pension and your number of PRSI contributions. If you don’t qualify for the
maximum rate, you may get a reduced rate.

The table below includes maximum rates based on January 2024 rates of State
Pension (Contributory).

**Age when you start to claim** |  **Maximum rate** |  **Increase for qualified adult (under 66)** |  **Increase for qualified adult (66 and over)**  
---|---|---|---  
Age 66  |  €277.30  |  €184.70  |  €248.60   
Age 67  |  €290.30  |  €193.40  |  €260.30   
Age 68  |  €304.80  |  €203.00  |  €273.20   
Age 69  |  €320.30  |  €213.30  |  €287.10   
Age 70  |  €337.20  |  €224.60  |  €302.30   
  
You can also get an [ increase in your payment for child dependants (known as
an Increase for a Qualified Child or IQC)
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-
system/claiming-a-social-welfare-payment/claiming-and-increase-in-your-
payment-for-a-child-dependant/) .

###  **How many PRSI contributions can I make during deferral?**

During deferral, you can continue to make PRSI contributions to increase your
personal rate of payment, or meet the qualifying condition of 520 (10 years)
contributions for [ State Pension (Contributory).
](https://www.gov.ie/en/service/e6f908-state-pension-contributory/)

However, you will not be able to increase your contributions past the current
maximum of 2080 (40 years).

###  **Check your contribution record**

It is important to know how many contributions you have before you choose the
start date for your pension.

contributions and [ Long-Term Carers Contributions
