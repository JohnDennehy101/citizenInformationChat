#  Spotting the signs of an abusive relationship

  * Types of abuse 
  * Young people in abusive relationships 
  * What are my options? 
  * Are you concerned about someone you know? 
  * Support organisations and services 

##  Introduction

Everyone has arguments, and everyone disagrees with their partners, family
members and others close to them from time to time.

But if this becomes the norm in your relationship and you feel afraid of your
partner, then this is a sign of an abusive relationship. You can feel as if
you have no power over your life and that you are being controlled by your
partner.

Abuse can happen to anyone at any age and in any type of relationship. It can
happen to adults and it can happen to teenagers. And you don't have to be
married or living with your partner for them to act abusively towards you.

##  Types of abuse

An abusive relationship is where one person uses abuse to control and have
power over their partner in an intimate relationship. It can be:

  * Physical abuse 
  * Emotional abuse 
  * Online abuse 
  * Sexual abuse 
  * Economic (financial) abuse 
  * Digital abuse (carried out online or using technology) 

Coercive control is another type of abusive behaviour. This is when a
boyfriend or girlfriend, partner, husband or wife, or ex uses an ongoing
pattern of controlling, coercive and threatening behaviours to trap the person
in a relationship. Coercive control can make it impossible or even dangerous
to leave an abusive relationship and can include all or some forms of abuse.

This can result in a person changing their routines and losing contact with
family and friends. Coercive control can damage a person’s physical and
emotional well-being.

##  Young people in abusive relationships

Many young people, in particular young women, are subjected to abuse in their
intimate relationships. This is called ‘intimate relationship abuse’. This is
when your boyfriend, girlfriend or partner uses a pattern of abusive
behaviours to gain and maintain all the power in the relationship.

Abuse can happen in short-term relationships or even your first relationship.
You don’t need to be living with your boyfriend, girlfriend, or partner for
them to be abusive towards you.

If you are worried about your relationship, you can take a relationship quiz
on the website [ Too Into You ](https://www.toointoyou.ie/take-the-quiz/) to
see if there are warning signs that your partner’s behaviour is controlling.

Examples of controlling or abusive behaviour can include:

  * Controlling what you wear and who you see 
  * Sharing or threatening to share intimate images or videos of you without your consent 
  * Isolating you from family and friends to make you feel guilty if you don’t spend all your free time with them 
  * Bombarding you with texts and DMs and getting angry if you ignore them 
  * Demanding to look through your phone or social media 
  * Checking your text messages, email and social media accounts to keep tabs on you 
  * A bad temper, you feel afraid to disagree with them 
  * Physically attacking you or threatening to hurt you 
  * Threatening to hurt you, themselves or others if you end the relationship 
  * Forcing you to do sexual things against your will 

Any one of these signs is serious. Your partner does not need to do several or
all of these things for your relationship to be abusive. If it feels wrong, it
probably is. Talking with someone can help you understand what is happening
within your relationship and support you to stay safe. This might be family or
a close friend.

Or you might feel more comfortable discussing your situation with someone you
don’t know. There is free confidential support and information available
24-hours a day from national and local organisations (see Support
organisations and services below).

Young people who are worried about their own relationship or a friend’s
relationship can use the free and confidential Instant Messaging Support
Service at [ Too Into You ](https://www.toointoyou.ie/) .

**If you feel in immediate danger, call 112 or 999. Members of the Gardaí are
specially trained to deal with these situations and can help you get
support.**

##  What are my options?

Recognising that you are being abused is an important step. You may feel you
need time to think about your situation. Or perhaps you have already made up
your mind to end the relationship or to leave. Whatever you decide, your
safety (and that of your children if there are children) is always the
priority.

###  Domestic violence orders

If you are being subjected to abuse by a current or former partner, you can
get legal protection through the courts. The main kinds of protection
available are [ safety, protection and barring orders ](/en/birth-family-
relationships/problems-in-marriages-and-other-relationships/barring-safety-
and-protection-orders/) .

  * [ Refuges and domestic violence services in your area ](https://www.womensaid.ie/get-help/support-services/find-support-locally/)

Listed below are organisations offering a range of support services that will
be able to support you (see Support organisations and services below).

##  Are you concerned about someone you know?

You can take some basic steps to help and support a friend, family member,
colleague, neighbour or anyone who confides in you that they are experiencing
domestic abuse.

You can offer emotional support and you can offer practical support.

###  Emotional support

  * Listen, try to understand and be careful not to blame them. Nothing they do or say can justify the abuser's behaviour. 
  * Tell them they are not alone and that there are supports available if they need them. 
  * Support them as a friend. Encourage them to express their feelings, whatever they are. 
  * Don't tell them to leave the relationship if they are not ready to do this. This is their decision. 

###  Practical support

  * Tell them about the support services available (see Support organisations and services below). 
  * Give them mobile phone credit if they need it so they can make calls in case of emergency. 
  * Ask if they have suffered physical harm. If so, offer to go with them to a hospital or to see their GP. Suggest that it might be useful in future to have records of any injuries as abuse frequently escalates over time. 
  * Help them to report the assault to the police if they want to. 
  * Go with them to visit a solicitor if they are ready to take this step. 
  * Agree a code word with them which they can use if they are in danger and need help. 
  * Offer the use of your address and/or telephone number to leave information and messages, and tell them you can look after an emergency bag for them, if they want that. 
  * Give them a small amount of money to put away in case they need to get a taxi or bus in an emergency to leave the house and go to family or a refuge. 

Remember to look after yourself while you are supporting someone through such
a difficult and emotional time. Ensure that you do not put yourself into a
dangerous situation; for example, do not offer to talk to the abuser about
their behaviour or let yourself be seen by the abuser as a threat to their
relationship.

specially trained to deal with these situations and can help you get
