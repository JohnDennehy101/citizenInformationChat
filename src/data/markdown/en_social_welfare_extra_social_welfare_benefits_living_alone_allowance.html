  * How to apply for a Living Alone Increase 

##  What is the Living Alone Increase?

The Living Alone Increase is an extra payment for people who are living alone
and getting a social welfare payment.

##  How to qualify for a Living Alone Increase

###  If you are 66 or over

If you are aged 66 or over and live alone, you will qualify for the Living
Alone Increase if you are getting one of the following payments:

  * [ State Pension (Contributory) ](/en/social-welfare/older-and-retired-people/state-pension-contributory/)
  * [ State Pension (Non-Contributory) ](/en/social-welfare/older-and-retired-people/state-pension-non-contributory/)
  * [ Widow's, Widower's or Surviving Civil Partner's (Contributory) Pension ](/en/social-welfare/death-related-benefits/widowed-persons-contrib-pension/)
  * Widow's/Widower's Pension under the [ Occupational Injuries Benefit Scheme ](/en/social-welfare/disability-and-illness/occupational-injuries-benefit-overview/)
  * Incapacity Supplement under the Occupational Injuries Benefit Scheme 
  * [ Deserted Wife's Benefit ](/en/social-welfare/families-and-children/deserted-wife-s-payments/)

###  If you are under 66

If you are under 66 and live alone, you will qualify for the Living Alone
Increase if you’re getting one of the following payments:

  * [ Disability Allowance ](/en/social-welfare/disability-and-illness/disability-allowance/)
  * [ Invalidity Pension ](/en/social-welfare/disability-and-illness/invalidity-pension/)
  * [ Incapacity Supplement ](/en/social-welfare/disability-and-illness/disablement-benefit/)
  * [ Blind Pension ](/en/social-welfare/disability-and-illness/blind-persons-pension/)

###  Do I have to live alone to get the increase?

You must live alone to get the increase in your payment. However, there are
some exceptions.

####  Granny flats

If you are living in an extension of a family member's home - for example, in
a granny flat - you can qualify for the increase if you can show that you have
facilities to cook and eat alone.

You must also have your own living or dining room and sleeping accommodation.

####  Sheltered accommodation

If you live in sheltered accommodation, you may qualify for the Living Alone
Increase if you are regarded as living independently within the institution.
You can find a [ list of hostels and homes where the Living Alone Increase is
payable ](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/4df03c-list-of-hostels-and-homes-
where-living-alone-increase-is-payable/) on Gov.ie.

You will **not** qualify if you share dormitory accommodation with others or
have round-the clock supervision or nursing care.

People who live in nursing homes will **not** qualify as they cannot be
regarded as living completely or mainly alone.

####  People who can stay with you

You can also qualify as living alone if you:

  * Are aged or infirm and have a friend or relative to stay for security reasons at night-time only (the friend or relative must not contribute to the household financially) 
  * Live alone during the day but stay with relatives or friends at night or if you live alone during the week but have a relative to stay at the weekend (the living alone condition is satisfied as long as the relative has a permanent home address elsewhere) 
  * Live alone but occasionally take in paying guests (for example, during a local festival) - but if you run a bed and breakfast business (even for part of the year) you will not qualify 
  * Allow somebody who is **not** an employee or **not** an [ immediate family member ](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/f532d4-operational-guidelines-living-alone-increase/#:~:text=College%20Rd.%2C%20Sligo.-,Living%20Alone%20Condition,-In%20order%20to) to stay in your home rent free and you would be living alone, but for that person 
  * Are renting for at least 28 consecutive days to somebody who is **not** an employee and **not** an immediate family member, and you would be living alone, but for that person 
  * Are hosting somebody from Ukraine covered by the [ Temporary Protection Directive ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/moving-country/asylum-seekers-and-refugees/the-asylum-process-in-ireland/coming-to-ireland-from-ukraine/#4583cd) and you would be living alone, but for that person.
