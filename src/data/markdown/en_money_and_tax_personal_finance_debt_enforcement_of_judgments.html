#  Enforcement of debt judgments

  * Introduction 
  * What happens when the creditor has a judgment order? 
  * Execution against goods 
  * Instalment orders 
  * Attachment of earnings 
  * Other methods of enforcing judgments 

##  Introduction

If you owe money to someone else, then you are a **debtor** and the other
person is a **creditor** .

If you fail to pay a debt, your creditor can go to court to get a **judgment**
that you owe the debt. If your creditor has a judgment, it means they can now
use different ways to get the money from you. This is called **enforcing** **a
judgment** . The legal term is **execution** of the judgment.

The creditor chooses how to enforce the judgment, and can use several
different types of enforcement action at the same time. We explain these
below.

##  What happens when the creditor has a judgment order?

When the creditor has a judgment order from a court, the judgment can be
enforced through an enforcement order. Enforcement orders can be issued by
court offices – the creditor does not have to go back to court for the order.

Creditors have 12 years from the date of the judgment order to look for
enforcement orders. Enforcement orders are usually valid for one year and can
then be renewed.

If more than 6 years have passed since the judgment order was issued, **a
Leave of the court** (the court’s permission) is needed to continue.

###  What is a stay of execution?

When a court pauses an enforcement for a period of time, it is known as **stay
of execution** .

A stay of execution may be granted, for example, if you can show that it is
not your fault that you are unable to pay.

You cannot get a stay of execution if you have not been engaging with the
court process.

###  What does registration of the judgment mean?

By registering the judgment, the creditor makes it public that there is a
judgment against you for not paying money you owe. Registering the judgment
does not directly enforce the judgment.

When it is made public, you are unlikely to be able to borrow more money. The
creditor must tell you they plan to register the judgment before they register
it. This gives you a chance to pay the debt.

The creditor can register the court judgment in the Central Office of the High
Court. Credit reference agencies publish lists of judgments that are consulted
by banks (for example, in _Stubbs Gazette_ and some newspapers).

###  Main ways a creditor can enforce a judgment

There are 4 main ways a creditor can enforce a judgment which we explain
below:

  * Execution against goods 
  * Instalment orders, followed by committal orders (if necessary) 
  * Attachment of earnings 
  * Judgment mortgage (see more [ about home repossession ](/en/housing/losing-your-home-and-homelessness/home-repossession/) ) 

Other ways of enforcing judgments include attachment of debts, appointment of
a receiver and bankruptcy proceedings. These are rarely used for consumer
debts. They are briefly explained in ‘Other methods of enforcing judgments’
below.

##  Execution against goods

Execution against goods means that the creditor gets an order from the court
which directs the Sheriff or County Registrar to seize your goods. The goods
are sold and the money raised used to pay the unpaid debt.

This one of the main ways a creditor can enforce a judgment. It is sometimes
called **distress** against goods. Execution against goods can have different
forms in different courts.

**Type of court** |  **Unique information**  
---|---  
High Court Judgment  |  Known as an order of **fieri facias** or **fifa**  
Circuit Court Judgment  |  Known as an execution order against goods   
District Court Judgment  |  Court’s judgment or decree sent to the Sheriff or County Registrar to enforce   
  
###  Sheriffs and County Registrars

Sheriffs enforce judgments in Cork and Dublin. County Registrars enforce them
in all other places.

Sheriffs are self-employed people who are paid for their enforcement work on a
commission basis. The fees they get are set out in law. Under the law,
sheriffs currently receive various fixed fees and a scale of fees related to
the amount involved in the enforcement. It also covers various expenses the
sheriff has in the enforcement process.

County Registrars are civil servants whose main job is to organise the
business of the Circuit Court in their areas.

As well as County Sheriffs in Cork and Dublin, there are Revenue Sheriffs who
enforce debts owed to Revenue. They have the power to collect tax debts. They
do not need a court order to collect tax debts. Revenue Sheriffs have specific
powers to make an  instalment arrangement with you  . Revenue debts can also
be collected in the normal way if there is a court order.

###  Seizing your goods

The creditor can apply to court to have your financial circumstances examined
to see what available assets you have that can be used to carry out the
judgment.

####  Powers of a Sheriff or County Registrar to seize goods

The Sheriff or County Registrar does not have to give you notice of their
intention to seize your property or goods. Their duty is to the creditor, so
they cannot take your circumstances into account.

The Sheriff or County Registrar has the power to go onto your property to take
your goods. They must make reasonable efforts to do this peacefully. They are
entitled to forcibly enter your property.

The Sheriff or County Registrar must account to the court for the goods
seized. If no goods are found, they make a return of **nulla bona** ,
literally meaning **"no goods"** .

If the Sheriff or County Registrar does take your goods, they must give you an
itemised and signed list of the goods seized. They must give you this list
within 24 hours. They can then sell the goods by public auction. This can
happen at any time from 2 days after the seizure. In practice, you are usually
given warning of the sale.

####  What a Sheriff or Country Registrar cannot do

By law, the Sheriff or County Registrar cannot seize certain goods. They
cannot take your necessary clothes and bedding and the tools of your trade, if
the total value of such items is less than €19. In practice, goods with a low
resale value are unlikely to be seized. They are likely to take electrical
items, jewellery or your car (if you do not need it for work).

##  Instalment orders

An instalment order is when you are ordered to repay the money you owe over a
period of time in instalments that are judged affordable based on your
circumstances.

Your creditor can apply to the District Court in the district in which you
live to have you attend the court to assess your financial situation and
ability to pay. The judge may then order payment in full or payment in
instalments, taking account of your financial situation.

The instalment order procedure is mainly used by small creditors such as shops
and credit unions. It can be used for judgments given in the District, Circuit
or High Court.

It is also used by creditors in family law proceedings, mainly for the
enforcement of [ maintenance orders ](/en/birth-family-
relationships/separation-and-divorce/maintenance-orders-and-agreements/) . If
you are a family law debtor, your creditor can get an  attachment of earnings
order  . An example of a family law debtor is if you have a maintenance order
against you which has not been met.

Instalment orders are governed by the Enforcement of Court Orders Acts
1926–2009.

###  **If you do not meet an instalment order**

If you do not meet the instalment order, the creditor may look for a committal
order, which would send you to prison.

You can be imprisoned only if you can afford to pay debts but refuse to do so.

The law that sets out the procedure for committal orders is the [ Enforcement
of Court Orders (Amendment) Act 2009
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2009/act/21/enacted/en/html) .

First, the creditor asks the District Court clerk to issue you a summons to
appear at the District Court for a hearing. The summons must clearly set out:

  * The options available to the judge at the hearing 
  * The consequences if you do not turn up in court, including the possibility that you will be arrested or imprisoned 

Before the hearing, you must:

  * Prepare a statement of means setting out your income and expenditure on a weekly or monthly basis ( [ District Court Form ](https://www.courts.ie/content/forms-civil-proceedings) : 51A.02) 
  * Lodge this statement with the court at least a week before the hearing is due to take place 

At the hearing, both you and the creditor may give evidence. The creditor must
prove beyond reasonable doubt that you have the ability to repay (means), but
you are wilfully refusing to pay.

The court has a number of options:

  * It may change the instalment order. 
  * It may ask you to engage in mediation. The [ Money Advice and Budgeting Service (MABS) ](/en/money-and-tax/personal-finance/debt/mabs-service/) may be used for the mediation. 
  * It may make a committal order (for a maximum of 3 months). A committal order is an order to the Gardaí to arrest and imprison you. This can come into effect immediately, or at a later date. 

###  If you do not attend a hearing

If you do not turn up, without a reasonable excuse, the judge can either
adjourn the hearing or issue an arrest warrant. An arrest warrant orders the
Gardaí to bring you before the court as soon as possible.

If you are later arrested and brought to court, a date is fixed for the
hearing. The judge must make clear to you, in ordinary language:

  * That you are entitled to apply for legal aid, and 
  * The consequences if you do not comply with the instalment order or do not appear for the hearing on the date fixed – including going to prison 

The court has the power to grant you legal aid in line with the rules
governing the [ criminal legal aid scheme ](/en/justice/legal-aid-and-
advice/criminal-legal-aid/) .

##  Attachment of earnings

This is when the money you owe is deducted straight from your wages by direct
debit. The creditor seeks an order from court which is then served on the
debtor’s employer, who sets up a direct debit.

Attachment of earnings is currently only used for [ orders of maintenance of
spouses and children ](/en/birth-family-relationships/separation-and-
divorce/maintenance-orders-and-agreements/) .

##  Other methods of enforcing judgments

###  Judgment mortgage

The creditor may register a charge against property owned by you. The effect
is the same as taking out a mortgage. You have to pay off the judgment
mortgage when the property is sold. Read more [ about home repossession
](/en/housing/losing-your-home-and-homelessness/home-repossession/) .

###  Attachment of a debt, or _garnishee order_

If you owe money to a creditor and another person owes money to you, then your
creditor can get a court order directing that person to pay the money directly
to the creditor. This is known as a _garnishee order_ .

Generally, it is used only where there are no goods to be seized to be offset
against the judgment. It is relatively rarely used in cases of consumer debt.
[ Revenue has specific powers of attachment
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/money-and-tax/personal-
finance/debt/specific-debts/#7e36e37e36e3) which can be exercised without a
court order.

###  Appointment of a receiver

A receiver may be appointed over some of your assets or over future income
such as rents, income of a trust fund or a pension. The law in this area is
complex, but it seems that a receiver cannot be appointed over future
earnings.

###  Bankruptcy

If you are unable to pay your debts, you can apply to the High Court to be
declared bankrupt. Alternatively, your creditor may apply to have you declared
bankrupt if certain conditions are met. [ Read more about bankruptcy
](/en/money-and-tax/personal-finance/debt/personal-insolvency/what-is-
bankruptcy/) .
