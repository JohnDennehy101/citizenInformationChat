##  Thinking of going to college

You may be planning to go to college when you [ leave school
](/en/education/further-education-and-training/leaving-school/) or after your
[ Leaving Certificate ](/en/education/state-examinations/leaving-certificate/)
. Some people work for a number of years and then go to college as [ mature
students ](/en/education/third-level-education/applying-to-college/third-
level-courses-for-mature-students/) .

The [ Qualifax website ](http://www.qualifax.ie/) has a wide range of
information about higher and further education courses, from university
degrees to certificates and diplomas in further education colleges and
institutes of technology.

You can find more information about [ further and higher education
qualifications ](/en/education/third-level-education/colleges-and-
qualifications/fet-qualifications/) which are all included in [ the National
Framework of Qualifications (NFQ) ](https://www.qqi.ie/what-we-do/the-
qualifications-system/national-framework-of-qualifications) . The NFQ
classifies the level, class of award and type of qualifications in Ireland,
from Level 1 literacy qualifications through to Junior Cycle, Leaving
Certificate and Level 10 doctoral degrees.

##  Applying to college

You should check the application procedures and entrance requirements for the
third-level courses you are interested in as soon as possible.

You apply for almost all full-time third-level education undergraduate courses
through the [ Central Applications Office (CAO)
](https://www.cao.ie/index.php) . There are many [ important dates in the CAO
calendar ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/education/third-level-
education/applying-to-college/application-procedures-and-entry-
requirements/#50eadd) every year so don’t miss any deadlines. You can find a
list of the courses on offer and information on how to apply in the [ CAO
handbook ](https://www.cao.ie/handbook.php) .

There are supports available to help you access third-level education if you:

  * Have a [ disability, specific learning difficulty or significant ongoing illness ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/education/third-level-education/applying-to-college/third-level-admissions-scheme-for-students-with-disabilities/)
  * Are a school-leaver from a socially disadvantaged background 

###  **Tertiary education programme**

A new pathway to a degree is through the [ Tertiary education programme
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/education/third-level-
education/applying-to-college/tertiary-education-programme/) . You do not
apply through the CAO and you do not need the same Leaving Certificate points.
You start your degree programme in a further education college and finish it
in a higher education (third level) college or university.

Alternatively, you can apply for [ Post-Leaving Certificate (PLC) courses
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/education/further-education-and-
training/post-leaving-certificate-courses/) directly to the individual
colleges. You don’t apply through the CAO.

###  **Studying abroad**

If you are thinking of [ studying in the UK
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/education/third-level-
education/studying-abroad/studying-in-the-uk-including-northern-ireland/) or [
abroad ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/education/third-level-
education/studying-abroad/studying-outside-ireland/) , you should find out
about the application procedures, length of courses, fees (if applicable) and
living expenses. You may wish to visit a college before you apply. The
application process starts earlier for UK and Northern Irish colleges than in
Ireland. This means you should begin looking at courses at least 12 months
before you plan to start studying.

##  Paying for college

You should check whether you have to pay [ fees for your college course.
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/education/third-level-education/fees-
and-supports-for-third-level-education/fees/) Most students doing
undergraduate courses do not have to pay the fees.

If you do have to pay fees, you may be able to claim [ tax relief on the fees
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/education/third-level-education/fees-
and-supports-for-third-level-education/tax-relief-for-third-level-fees/) .

Most third-level colleges charge an annual [ student contribution
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/education/third-level-education/fees-
and-supports-for-third-level-education/fees/#ld8ce9) . It is also known as a
registration fee and it covers student services and examinations. The amount
of the contribution varies from one institution to another. Depending on your
circumstances, you may qualify for an exemption from the student contribution.

There are [ means-tested maintenance grants
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/education/third-level-education/fees-
and-supports-for-third-level-education/student-grant-scheme/) for students
doing third-level courses. Read more about [ other financial supports
available for students going to college ](/en/education/third-level-
education/fees-and-supports-for-third-level-education/financial-supports-for-
students/) .

##  Finding somewhere to live

Some students live at home while at college, but you may live too far away to
travel to college every day.

Many universities or colleges have residences for some students. These must be
registered with the Residential Tenancies Board (RTB). You can check the [
Student Specific Accommodation Register (pdf)
](https://www.rtb.ie/images/uploads/old/general/SSA_Register_April_2024.pdf)
on the RTB website.

The RTB also has information about:

  * [ Renting in college, and tips for students ](https://www.rtb.ie/registration-and-compliance/rights-and-responsibilities/renting-in-college/)
  * [ Providing student specific accommodation ](https://www.rtb.ie/registration-and-compliance/registrations/student-specific-accommodation) , including rent setting and notice periods for ending a tenancy 

If you don’t find student specific accommodation, you may have to [ look for a
house or flat to rent ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/housing/renting-
a-home/looking-for-a-flat-or-house-to-rent/) . Spunout has published some
information on [ how to find student accommodation
](https://spunout.ie/life/accommodation/student-accommodation) .

Once you find a place to rent, you should be aware of [ your rights and
responsibilities as a tenant
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/housing/renting-a-home/tenants-rights-
and-responsibilities/tenants-rights-and-obligations/) .

##  More information

You can find [ a list of higher education institutions
](https://hea.ie/higher-education-institutions/?v=l) on the Higher Education
Authority’s website. You can read more about leaving school [ in our guide for
school leavers
](https://www.citizensinformationboard.ie/en/publications/information/leaflets.html)
.
