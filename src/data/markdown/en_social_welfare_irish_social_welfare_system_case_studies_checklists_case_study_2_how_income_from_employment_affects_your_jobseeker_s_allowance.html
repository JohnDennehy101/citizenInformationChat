#  Case study: How income from work affects your Jobseeker's Allowance

  * Case study 

##  Case study

###  This case study shows the effect of work on Jobseeker's Allowance (2023
rates)

###  Case study

Frank is living with his partner Joanne and their two children. He recently
lost his job and has applied for Jobseeker's Allowance. He has some temporary
work driving a minibus for a local disability service every Saturday and
Sunday. His assessable average weekly earnings are €140.

Joanne is working part-time for 3 days a week and earns €85 per week. She is
also getting Child Benefit for the two children aged under 12.

They recently sold their old family home and bought a newer house. They made a
profit of €15,000 on the sale of their house and have an additional €5,000
savings.

###  Step 1

**First calculate Frank and Joanne's means.**

Frank's assessable income from employment €60

(See note 1)

Joanne's assessable income from employment €15  
(See note 2)

Means assessed from savings 0  
(See note 3)

Total means €75

**Step 2**

**Calculate Frank's maximum rate of Jobseeker's Allowance.** This includes the
maximum personal rate and any increase for a qualified adult

Jobseeker's Allowance rate €220

Add increase for a qualified adult €146

Add increase for child dependents €84

Total €450

**Step 3**

**Maximum rate of Jobseeker's Allowance** _less_ **assessable means.** In this
case,

Maximum rate of Jobseeker's Allowance €450

Less assessable means €75

Total €375 (JA personal rate plus increases for dependents)

**Total** Jobseeker's Allowance rate payable to Frank **€375**

###  Note 1

Firstly, assess Frank's income from work using the following formula:

€20 per day from casual work (up to a maximum of €60) will be deducted from
his average assessable weekly earnings and then 60% of the balance will be
assessed as his weekly means.

€140 - €40 (2 days work) = €100 x 60% = €60

The following allowances are always deducted from your gross earnings to get
your assessable earnings:

  * PRSI contributions 
  * Union dues 
  * Superannuation 
  * PRSA (Personal Retirement Savings Account 
  * AVCs (Additional Voluntary Contributions) 

Frank's weekly means from employment of €60 is less than the maximum amount he
would be entitled to for his circumstances (€409.70). Because we now know he
is entitled to a certain amount of Jobseeker's Allowance the next step is to
calculate the actual amount of Jobseeker's Allowance he is entitled to. To do
this you must calculate his 'assessable daily earnings'.

He is entitled to JA only for periods of unemployment. The minimum period a
person must be unemployed in order to receive JA is 4 days in a period of 7
consecutive days. Frank has 5 consecutive days of unemployment. He is employed
for 2 days out of 7. (Sunday is counted as a day of work.)

Frank's average assessable daily earnings are €140

**Less** disregard for days worked €140 - €40 = €100 (No disregard for Sunday)

60 % of his assessable daily earnings of €100= €60

Frank's assessable income from employment is €60

###  Note 2

Joanne's income from employment is €85.

€20 per day from casual work (up to a maximum of €60) will be deducted from
her average assessable weekly earnings and then 60% of the balance will be
assessed as her weekly means.

€85 - €60 (3 days worked) = €25 x 60% = €15

Child Benefit is not taken into account in the assessment of means.

More information can be found in our document [ How Jobseeker's Allowance is
affected by income from employment ](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-
system/means-test-for-social-welfare-payments/work-and-jobseekers-allowance/)
and in our [ Worksheet on Jobseeker's Allowance and income from work
](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/case-studies-
checklists/worksheet-jobseekers-allowance-and-income-from-work/) .

###  Note 3

Joanne and Frank have combined savings of €20,000. This is below the €20,000
threshold and is not taken into account as means.
