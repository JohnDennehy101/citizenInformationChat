##  Introduction

The [ Garda Síochána ](http://www.garda.ie/) (also commonly referred to as the
Gardaí) is the national police force in the Republic of Ireland. The name
Garda Síochána in English means 'guardians of the peace'.

The Garda Síochána has responsibility for carrying out all policing duties in
the Irish State. It also provides State security services and carries out
criminal and traffic law enforcement.

The Gardaí have many powers including the [ powers to arrest you
](/en/justice/arrests/arrests/) in some cases if they suspect you of
committing a criminal offence. They also have the [ power to search you or
your property ](/en/justice/arrests/powers-of-search/) in some cases.
Uniformed Gardaí do not routinely carry firearms.

The Minister for Justice must account to the [ Oireachtas
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/government_in_ireland/houses_of_the_oireachtas/)
(Irish parliament) for the performance of the Garda Síochána. The main
functions of the Gardaí and its organisational structure are currently set out
in the [ Garda Síochána Act 2005
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2005/en/act/pub/0020/index.html) . This
legislation will be replaced by the [ Policing, Security and Community Safety
Act 2024 ](https://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2024/act/1/enacted/en/html) .

###

##  Organisation and structure

There are over 14,000 members of the Garda Síochána.

A [ Garda Commissioner ](https://www.garda.ie/en/about-us/our-
departments/offices-of-the-commissioner-deputy-commissioners-and-cao/)
appointed by the Government is responsible for the day-to-day running of the
force.

The Commissioner is assisted by a Deputy Commissioner and a Chief
Administrative Officer. Below them are a number of Assistant Commissioners who
are responsible for geographical regions, or critical portfolios, such as
National Support Services or Traffic.

Below Assistant Commissioner the [ Garda rank structure
](https://www.garda.ie/en/about-us/organisational-structure/) is as follows:

  * Chief Superintendent 
  * Superintendent 
  * Inspector 
  * Sergeant 
  * Garda 
  * Reserve Garda 

###  Garda regions and districts

Ireland is divided into 4 Garda regions, each of which has a regional
Assistant Commissioner.

The 4 regions are:

  * Dublin Metropolitan Region 
  * North Western Region 
  * Eastern Region 
  * Southern Region 

Each region is divided into divisions.

A Chief Superintendent is in charge of each division. Each division is divided
into districts, each of which has a superintendent in charge. Districts are
divided into sub-districts, each normally the responsibility of a sergeant.

Each sub-district usually has only 1 Garda station. The number of Gardaí in a
station can vary from 3 to 100 Gardaí.

Each district has a superintendent in charge (also known as the District
Officer). The superintendent has specific functions such as granting of
licences for the sale of alcohol and issuing firearms certificates.

structure-organisation-chart-2024.pdf) .

###  Garda Reserve

The Garda Reserve is an unpaid body of voluntary members and can provide extra
personnel when required. Reserve Gardaí have certain Garda powers while on
duty and perform their policing duties under the supervision of, and supported
by, regular Gardaí.

Their main role is to do local patrols and crime reduction initiatives,
targeted at specific local problem areas.

Information on the Garda Reserve is available on the [ Garda website
](http://www.garda.ie/Controller.aspx?Page=165&Lang=1) .

##  Reporting a crime

If you are a victim of a crime, you should contact the Gardaí. The emergency
services telephone number is 999 or 112.

In less urgent situations you should [ contact your local Garda station
](http://www.garda.ie/Stations/Default.aspx) . There is more information about
reporting a crime to the Gardaí in our document on [ reporting a crime
](/en/justice/law-enforcement/reporting-a-crime/) .

[ Crimestoppers ](https://www.justice.ie/en/JELR/Pages/WP15000275) is run by
the Gardaí and the business community. You can give information to the Gardaí
about any criminal investigation using the confidential freephone number 1800
25 00 25. This confidential freephone number is staffed by specially trained
detective Gardaí.

You can find [ more information on reporting a crime

##  Getting your information held by the Gardaí

You have the right to be told whether the Gardaí have any information about
you, under the [ GDPR ](/en/government-in-ireland/data-protection/overview-of-
general-data-protection-regulation/) and the [ Data Protection Acts
](https://enterprise.gov.ie/en/who-we-are/corporate-information/data-
protection/) . You also have a right to a copy of that information.

However, if the Gardaí are holding information about you and giving the
information to you would be likely to prejudice the prevention, detection and
investigation of crime or the apprehension or prosecution of offenders, you
will not be given access to this information.

###  **I need to get a Police Certificate**

Police Certificates are often required before you can apply for a visa to
visit or travel to other countries. There is [ more information about how to

If you are working or volunteering with children or vulnerable adults in
Ireland, you must be vetted by the Gardaí. This process checks if you have a
criminal record or any history that might pose a threat to vulnerable people.

Síochána (pdf) ](https://www.garda.ie/en/about-us/publications/policy-
