#  Bereavement and childbirth

  * Introduction 
  * What is miscarriage? 
  * What is stillbirth? 
  * What is Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS)? 
  * Getting support after the death of a child 

##  Introduction

The death of a baby is deeply saddening. Whether you suffer a miscarriage, a
stillbirth or the sudden death of an infant, you can be left with deep
feelings of grief and loss. Grief is an individual process and you and your
partner or family may grieve in different ways.

This page explains the differences between miscarriage and stillbirth. It also
has information about Sudden Infant Death Syndrome, and the services available
to support you if you have lost your baby.

##  What is miscarriage?

If you lose your baby before 24 weeks’ gestation, or before your baby reaches
a weight of 500 grams, this is called a miscarriage.

Miscarriage often happens with no warning, and there is often no medical
reason why it happened. This can be very distressing, and while you may
physically recover quite quickly, it can take much longer to recover
emotionally.

You can read more about [ the signs of miscarriage
](https://www2.hse.ie/conditions/miscarriage/) on the HSE website.

You can also find information on the supports available following the loss of
a baby below.

##  What is stillbirth?

If your baby is born after 24 weeks' gestation (or if your baby weighs more
than 500 grams) and they show no sign of life, this is called a stillbirth.

When a baby lives for only a few hours or days after birth, their death is
known as a ‘neonatal death’.

A stillbirth can happen for various reasons, but sometimes the cause is
unknown. Because of this, you may be asked to consent to a post-mortem
examination. It is normal to feel heartbroken and very distressed during this
time. [ Read more about stillbirth on the HSE website
](https://www2.hse.ie/conditions/stillbirth/) .

At the hospital, the hospital staff will help with any wishes you might have –
for example, to hold your baby, or to take photographs. The hospital social
worker can refer you to bereavement counselling and link you to specialist
support services. You may also want to discuss having a religious service with
the hospital chaplain.

When you get home, your GP can refer you to specialist counselling if you are
finding it hard to cope. You can also find other ways of getting support
below.

###  Registering your baby’s stillbirth

If you want to, you can register your baby’s stillbirth and apply for a
stillbirth certificate. This is optional and not mandatory.

Read more about [ how to register a baby’s stillbirth ](/en/birth-family-
relationships/miscarriage-and-stillbirth/registering-stillbirth/) .

###  Maternity leave and paternity leave

If you are the mother or birthing parent of a stillborn baby, you are entitled
to 26 weeks' [ maternity leave ](/en/employment/employment-rights-and-
conditions/leave-and-holidays/maternity-leave/) . You may also be entitled to
[ Maternity Benefit ](/en/social-welfare/families-and-children/maternity-
benefit/) .

The other parent is also entitled to take 2 weeks’ [ paternity leave
](/en/employment/employment-rights-and-conditions/leave-and-
holidays/paternity-leave/) , and get 2 weeks’ [ Paternity Benefit
](/en/social-welfare/families-and-children/paternity-benefit/) if they have
made enough social insurance (PRSI) contributions.

##  What is Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS)?

Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (or ‘SIDS’) refers to the sudden death of a
previously healthy baby under a year old. SIDS was previously known as ‘cot
death’.

Research shows that the cause of SIDS is unknown. This means that babies
appear healthy prior to their death, and SIDS cannot be prevented. You can
find more [ information about SIDS ](https://www2.hse.ie/conditions/cot-
death/) on the HSE website.  

##  Getting support after the death of a child

If you have experienced a miscarriage or stillbirth, you can get support from
staff at the maternity hospital. You can also [ contact your GP for support
](https://www2.hse.ie/services/find-a-gp/) .
