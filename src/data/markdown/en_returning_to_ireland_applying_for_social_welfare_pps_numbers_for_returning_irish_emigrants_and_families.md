##  What is a PPS number (PPSN)?

When you return to Ireland, you will need a [ Personal Public Service (PPS)
number ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/irish-social-
welfare-system/personal-public-service-number/) to access social welfare
benefits and public services in Ireland.

A PPS number is a unique reference number that lets you:

  * Register with Revenue for tax (if you are working in Ireland) 
  * Apply for a social welfare payment (including Child Benefit) 
  * Apply for a driving licence 

A PPS number is always 7 numbers followed by either one or 2 letters.

##  Do I have a PPS number already?

If you are returning home to Ireland, you may already have a PPS number.

You already have a PPS number if you:

  * Were born in Ireland from 1971 onwards 
  * Started work in Ireland after April 1979 
  * Are getting an Irish social welfare payment 

If you already have a PPS number, you do not need to apply for a new one.

###  **Where can I find my PPS number?**

Your PPS number is 7 numbers followed by either one or 2 letters. You can find
your PPS number on your:

  * [ Public Services Card ](http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/Public-Services-Card_holder.aspx) or Social Services Card 
  * [ Medical card ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/health/medical-cards-and-gp-visit-cards/medical-card/) or [ GP visit card ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/health/medical-cards-and-gp-visit-cards/gp-visit-cards/)
  * [ European Health Insurance Card ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/travel-and-recreation/travel-abroad/european-health-insurance-card/)
  * [ Drugs Payment Scheme Card ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/health/drugs-and-medicines/drugs-payment-scheme/)
  * Letters from the Department of Social Protection or Revenue 
  * Payslips from your employer in Ireland 

If you do not know your PPS number, contact your [ Intreo Centre or local
Social Welfare Branch Office
](https://www.gov.ie/en/directory/category/e1f4b5-intreo-offices/) , and staff
there can find your number for you.

##  I lost my PPS number

If you cannot find your PPS number, contact Client Identity Services in the
Department of Social Protection. You can:

  * Email [ cis@welfare.ie ](mailto:cis@welfare.ie)
  * Phone **+353 71 967 2616** , if calling from outside Ireland 
  * Phone **0818 927 999** , if calling from within Ireland 

##  Apply for a PPS number as an adult

Before you apply for a PPS number, check if you already have one (see ‘Do I
have a PPS number already?’ above).

###  **Supporting documents**

When you apply for a PPS number, you must show:

  * **Proof of why you need a PPS number** , for example, because you are starting a new job and need to register for tax with Revenue, or because you need to apply for a social welfare payment. 
  * **Proof of your identity** , including your birth certificate and photo ID. Read more about what is accepted as [ proof of identity to get a PPS number ](https://www.gov.ie/en/service/12e6de-get-a-personal-public-service-pps-number/#rules) on Gov.ie. 
  * **Proof of your address** , such as a utility bill or bank statement. As you are returning home from abroad, you may not have a utility bill with your name on it. In this case, the Department of Social Protection will accept non-standard proof of address. For example, if you are living temporarily with friends or family, you can ask the named bill payer to write on their addressed utility bill to confirm you are staying at their address. You can also ask the manager of a hotel or hostel to confirm you are staying with them. 

**How to apply**

You must wait until you are back in Ireland to apply for your PPS number. You
can [ apply for a PPS number online
](https://services.mywelfare.ie/en/topics/identity-services/personal-public-
service-pps-number/) if you have registered for a [ basic MyGovID account
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/government-in-ireland/how-government-
works/egovernment/mygovid/) .

There is a service that lets people apply for a PPS number when they live
outside Ireland, but need to engage with a specified body in Ireland (for
example, the Probate Office). In these cases, you can contact the Department
of Social Protection’s, [ Client Identity Services (CIS)
](https://www.revenue.ie/en/jobs-and-pensions/personal-public-service-
number/index.aspx) . This service is not available to people relocating to
Ireland.

You can contact them by:

  * Email at [ cis@welfare.ie ](mailto:cis@welfare.ie)
  * Telephone at **0818 927 999** (or **+353 71 967 2616** , if calling from abroad) 

They will send you the forms to request a new PPSN.

When you have returned these forms, they will then write to you with a
response.

##  Apply for a PPS number for a child who was born abroad

If you are returning home to Ireland with a child who was born abroad, you may
need a PPS number for that child.

You can't apply for your children's PPS numbers until you are back in Ireland.
However, you can download and complete the [ application form for a child's
PPS number (REG1M) (pdf)
](https://assets.gov.ie/71516/89e65d7310ae4557b3537383c61c781f.pdf) so that
it's ready to submit to [ your nearest PPS Number Allocation Centre
](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/f3690a-personal-public-service-pps-number-
allocation-centres-by-county/) when you arrive.

You'll need to complete a separate form for each child.

You need proof of:

  * Your own identity 
  * The child’s identity 
  * The reason they need a PPS number (for example, to access medical services) 
  * Your relationship with the child 
  * Your address. If you are living temporarily with friends or family, you can ask the named bill payer to write on their addressed utility bill to confirm you are staying at their address. You can also ask the manager of a hotel or hostel to confirm you are staying with them. 

The Department of Social Protection may contact you to confirm your
relationship with the child.
