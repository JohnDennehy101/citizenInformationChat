##  Lay-offs and short-time working

Your employer may lay you off or reduce your working hours (put you on short-
time) for a number of weeks. This can happen if there is a lack of work
available or changes to the financial circumstances of the business.

The difference between a lay off and short-time can be confusing and you have
different rights in each situation.

A lay-off is when your employer tells you that they expect you to have **no
work** for a temporary period and you will not be paid. If a lay-off goes on
for certain period of time, you may be entitled to claim for [ redundancy
](/en/employment/unemployment-and-redundancy/redundancy/what-is-redundancy/) .

On the other hand, short-time working is when your hours and pay **are
reduced** due to a decrease in work.

##  What is the difference between a lay off and short-time working?

**Lay-off**

You can be facing a lay-off if your employer:

  * Cannot provide work for you 
  * Believes this is a temporary situation 
  * Gives you notification of the lay off before the work finishes 

If you are laid off, while you may not be working, you are still an employee
of the company. This means that, although, you are not being paid, you have
rights.

**Short-time working**

Short-time working refers to a specific temporary situation where either:

  * Your weekly pay is less than half your normal weekly pay 
  * The hours you work are reduced to less than half of your normal weekly working hours 

Your employer must notify you of the reduction in hours or pay (or both)
before short-time working starts.

##  What social welfare payments can I get during a lay-off or short-time
working?

There are social welfare supports available, depending on your situation.

If you are laid off or are on short-time working, you may be entitled to [
Jobseeker’s Benefit ](/en/social-welfare/unemployed-people/jobseekers-
benefit/) or [ Jobseeker’s Allowance ](/en/social-welfare/unemployed-
people/jobseekers-allowance/) .

If you are getting [ Working Family Payment ](/en/social-welfare/families-and-
children/working-family-payment/) , this may be affected by the reduction in
your working hours.

##  Your rights for short-time working and lay-off

You have rights and your employer must follow rules if they bring in temporary
lay-offs or short-time working arrangements.

###  It must be in your contract or with your agreement

Your employer can lay you off or put you on short-time if:

  * It is in your contract of employment 
  * It is custom and practice in your workplace 

Otherwise, your employer **will need your agreement** to lay you off or put
you on short-time. However, if you do not agree, you may be made [ redundant
](/en/employment/unemployment-and-redundancy/redundancy/what-is-redundancy/) .

You can read more about your options if you do not agree in our page on [
being asked to reduce your pay or hours of work ](/en/employment/employment-
rights-and-conditions/contracts-of-employment/being-asked-to-take-a-cut-in-
pay-or-hours/) .

###  Employer must give you notice and keep you informed

Your employer should explain the reason for the lay-off or short-time working
to you. They should keep you informed of the situation during the period of
lay-off or short-time working.

Both a lay-off or short-time must be temporary situations and your employer
must give you notice of this before they start. The law on lay-off and short-
time does not set out any minimum period of notice you must get.

###  Employer must be fair and cannot discriminate when selecting employees

When selecting employees for lay-off or short-time working, employers should
apply the same criteria for selection as for redundancy. The criteria should
be reasonable and applied fairly.

For example, the custom and practice in the workplace may be last in, first
out, or the contract of employment may set out criteria for selection.

Under [ employment equality law ](http://www.ihrec.ie/publications/list/ihrec-
employment-equality-rights-explained/) , the selection must not discriminate
against employees on any of the following 9 grounds:

  * Gender 
  * Civil status 
  * Family status 
  * Age 
  * Disability 
  * Religious belief 
  * Race 
  * Sexual orientation or 
  * Membership of the Traveller community 

###  You still receive public holiday benefit during lay-off or short-time

During lay-off or short-time working, you still are employed by your employer
and your contract of employment remains valid. This means that you are
entitled to benefit for any [ public holidays ](/en/employment/employment-
rights-and-conditions/leave-and-holidays/public-holidays/) that occur during
the first 13 weeks of lay-off.

Part-time employee must have worked at least 40 hours in the 5 weeks before
the public holiday to receive this benefit.

You do not build up [ annual leave ](/en/employment/employment-rights-and-
conditions/leave-and-holidays/annual-leave/) during lay-off, but you are
entitled to take annual leave that you built up before being laid off.

###  Lay-off and reckonable service

To qualify for statutory redundancy, you must have 104 weeks of _continuous
employment_ with your employer. A period of lay-off will not break your
continuous employment.

How much redundancy pay you qualify for is based on your pay and the length of
your [ reckonable service ](/en/employment/unemployment-and-
redundancy/redundancy/redundancy-payments#lf6d25) . A lay-off that happens in
the 3 year period before your employment ends does not count towards your
reckonable service.

####  I was laid off due to COVID-19

Please see the table below to see what counts towards reckonable service.

##  How to claim redundancy from your employer

You can claim redundancy if you are on a lay-off or short-time working or a
combination of both for either:

  * At least 4 consecutive weeks 
  * 6 weeks within the last 13 weeks 

You may be entitled to a [ redundancy payment ](/en/employment/unemployment-
and-redundancy/redundancy/redundancy-payments/) provided that you [ qualify
for redundancy. ](/en/employment/unemployment-and-redundancy/redundancy/right-
to-redundancy-pay/)

When you claim for redundancy in a lay-off situation, you are stating that you
believe that your employer cannot offer you work. And you want to be released
from your contract, wish to receive your redundancy payment and want to look
for new work.

A lay-off does not involve the termination of your contract of employment,
whereas a redundancy does.

###  Step 1: Give your employer your written notice

You must give your written notice of your intention to claim redundancy
payment in respect of the lay off-off or short- time. The best way to do this
is by using Part B of [ form RP9 (pdf)
](http://www.workplacerelations.ie/en/Publications_Forms/Lay_Off_and_Short_Term_Procedures_Form_RP9_.pdf)
.

You do not have to give notice as soon as you have been laid off or kept on
short-time. You can chose to wait longer. If the short-time or lay-off stops
and you decide to claim redundancy payment, you must give notice within 4
weeks after the lay-off or short-time working ends. Once this deadline passes,
you are no longer entitled to claim a payment in respect of the period of lay-
off or short-time.

###  Step 2: Your employer responds or does not respond

Your employer has 7 days to either accept your claim or give you ‘counter
notice’. If your employer does not give you counter notice, they are assumed
to have accepted your claim.

Counter notice is when your employer tells you that there will be work for you
to do that will:

  * Start in the next 4 weeks from the date of your claim 
  * Last at least for 13 weeks without lay-off 

###  How claiming redundancy affects your right to receive notice

You should note that if you claim redundancy, you have left your job
voluntarily. Therefore, you lose any [ right to notice from your employer
](/en/employment/unemployment-and-redundancy/losing-your-job/losing-job-
entitlements/) .

However, if you have been laid off and you are later made redundant by your
employer, you keep your right to receive notice.

You can get more information about [ redundancy notice periods
](/en/employment/unemployment-and-redundancy/redundancy/redundancy-notice-
periods/) .

###  What law covers claiming redundancy?

The [ Redundancy Payments Acts 1967-2014
](http://www.lawreform.ie/_fileupload/RevisedActs/WithAnnotations/HTML/EN_ACT_1967_0021.htm)
covers redundancy rules.
