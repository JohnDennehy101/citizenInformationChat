Victimisation at work

#  Victimisation at work

  * Introduction 
  * Ways you can be victimised at work 
  * What to do if you are being victimised 
  * Employment legislation prohibiting victimisation 

##  Introduction

Victimisation is where you are treated unfairly by your employer because of
some action you have taken to access your legal employment rights.

As a worker, you have strong employment rights, and you cannot be punished by
your employer for seeking to avail of those rights.

You are protected from victimisation under various employment legislation.
Some legislation uses the word penalisation, other legislation refers to it as
_victimisation_ .

##  Ways you can be victimised at work

Your employer can victimise you at work by:

  * Unfairly dismissing you from your job 
  * Treating you unfairly in work 
  * Making unfavourable changes to your work conditions 
  * Reducing your hours in work as punishment 

It is only victimisation if the action is being done because you tried to
enforce your employment rights. If there are other reasons, it may be may be [
harassment ](/en/employment/equality-in-work/harassment-at-work/) or [
bullying ](/en/employment/equality-in-work/bullying-at-work/) .  

##  What to do if you are being victimised

If you have been victimised in work, you can [ make a complaint to the
Workplace Relations Commission ](/en/employment/enforcement-and-
redress/enforcing-your-employment-rights/) .

You should use the [ online complaint form
](https://www.workplacerelations.ie/en/Complaints_Disputes/Refer_a_Dispute_Make_a_Complaint/)
available on workplacerelations.ie. You must make your complaint within 6
months of the last act of victimisation or the date of dismissal. This time
limit can be increased to 12 months but only if there is reasonable cause
which prevented you from making the complaint within the normal time limit.

Read more about [ how to make a complaint ](/en/employment/enforcement-and-
redress/adjudication-employment-rights-disputes-and-complaints/) , including
details of the WRC adjudication process.

##  Employment legislation prohibiting victimisation

You cannot be victimised for looking into, accessing, asking about your rights
or making a complaint under the following legislation:

**Employment right** |  **Legislation** |  **Protection against victimisation**  
---|---|---

**Employment equality** |  [ Employment Equality Acts 1998-2015 ](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1998/en/act/pub/0021/index.html) |  If you brought a claim or gave evidence in proceedings against your employer under the Act, you are protected against victimisation.

Victimisation includes dismissal in order to avoid a fixed-term contract being considered an open-ended contract.   
**Fixed-term employees** |  [ Protection of Employees (Fixed-Term Work) Act 2003 ](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2003/en/act/pub/0029/index.html) |  [ Fixed-term employees ](http://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/employment/employment_rights_and_conditions/contracts_of_employment/fixed_term_or_specified_purpose_contracts.html) cannot be penalised for claiming their rights under the Act.

Under the [ Criminal Justice Act 2011 ](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2011/en/act/pub/0022/index.html) if you disclose information to the Gardaí or give evidence about relevant offences, your employer is banned from penalising or dismissing you for this.   
**Carer's leave** |  [ Carer’s Leave Act 2001 ](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2001/en/act/pub/0019/index.html) |  You are protected against being victimised for applying for or taking [ carer’s leave. ](http://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/employment/employment_rights_and_conditions/leave_and_holidays/carers_leave_from_employment.html)  
**Parent’s leave** |  [ Parent's Leave and Benefit Act 2019 ](https://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2019/act/35/section/19/enacted/en/html#sec19) |  You are protected against being victimised for applying for or taking [ parent’s leave ](../employment_rights_and_conditions/leave_and_holidays/parents_leave.en.html) .
