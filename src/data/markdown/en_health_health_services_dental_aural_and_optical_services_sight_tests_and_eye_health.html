##  Introduction

You may be able to get free healthcare, eye tests, and glasses:

  * If you have a [ medical card ](/en/health/medical-cards-and-gp-visit-cards/medical-card/)
  * Under the [ Treatment Benefit Scheme ](/en/social-welfare/disability-and-illness/treatment-benefit-scheme/) if you have enough PRSI contributions 
  * If you are living with [ Hepatitis C and have a Health Amendment Act Card ](/en/health/health-services/blood-and-organ-donation/hepatitis-c-and-health-amendment-act-cards/)

Children can get free eye tests and treatment under pre-school developmental
checks. School health services also do testing and refer children for free
treatment.

Eye healthcare services in Ireland is provided by the Health Service Executive
(HSE) or by private practitioners.

Eye health professionals include optometrists, dispensing opticians and
ophthalmologists. You can [ read more about these healthcare professionals
below. ](/en/health/health-services/dental-aural-and-optical-
services/optometric-and-ophthalmic-services#lbf667)

##  Free eye tests with the medical card

If you have a [ medical card ](/en/health/medical-cards-and-gp-visit-
cards/medical-card/) , you can get a free eye examination every 2 years from
the HSE. If you need glasses or spectacles, you can get free standard
spectacles.

If you have a medical condition that means you need an eye exam more often
than every two years, these eye exams are also free.

You must apply to your [ Local Health Office
](https://www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/1/lho/) for all eye exams and
dispensing.

##  Eye tests covered by the Treatment Benefit Scheme

If you do not qualify for free optical services from the HSE, the [ Treatment
Benefit Scheme ](/en/social-welfare/disability-and-illness/treatment-benefit-
scheme/) may cover you and your dependent spouse or partner for certain free
optical services.

The scheme is based on your social insurance [ (PRSI) contributions
](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/social-insurance-prsi/paying-
social-insurance/) . If you do not have enough PRSI contributions, you may
have to pay for the eye tests.

This scheme is run by the Department of Social Protection (DSP) and is also
called the Optical Benefit Scheme. The DSP has a [ list of available opticians
under the Treatment Benefits Scheme.
](https://www.gov.ie/en/collection/e67dc0-list-of-dispensing-opticians-
optometrists-and-ophthalmologists/)

##  Eye tests and glasses for children

####  For your baby after birth

Your child’s eyes will be tested soon after they are born. If your baby was
born in a hospital, this test is done before you bring your baby home. If
there are any problems with your baby's eyes, they will be referred to an eye
specialist for treatment.

####  At your child's developmental assessments

Your [ public health nurse will test your child's eyes
](https://www2.hse.ie/babies-children/checks-milestones/physical-
development/eye-health/#when-your-child%E2%80%99s-eyes-will-be-checked) during
their child developmental assessments. Your child will continue these
assessments in junior infant class at primary school, until they are aged 6.

####  Eye examinations for older children

If your child has sight problems at the [ school health service tests
](/en/health/health-services/children-s-health/school-health-services/) they
may be referred to an eye specialist for treatment.

If your child has a medical card this will cover the cost of treating any eye
problems found after they leave primary school.

####  Hospital eyecare

If your child is under 16 and they are treated at the outpatient department of
a public hospital, you [ do not have to pay any hospital charges
](/en/health/health-services/gp-and-hospital-services/hospital-charges/) .

eyes. ](https://www2.hse.ie/babies-children/checks-milestones/physical-
development/eye-health/)

##  How much does an eye test cost?

If you are not eligible for a free eye test, you may need to pay for your eyes
to be tested. You can contact a private optician to ask how much a sight test
and eye examination costs.

####  Tax relief on medical expenses

You may be able to [ claim tax relief for medical expenses ](/en/money-and-
tax/tax/income-tax-credits-and-reliefs/taxation-and-medical-expenses/) on some
eye health treatments. These optical treatments must be prescribed by an eye
healthcare professional. You can read more about [ taxation and medical
expenses ](/en/money-and-tax/tax/income-tax-credits-and-reliefs/taxation-and-
medical-expenses/) .

###  Diabetic Retina Screen

If you have diabetes and are aged 12 or over, you can get a free, regular
screening for diabetic retinopathy from the [ National Diabetic Retinal
Screening Programme ](https://www2.hse.ie/screening-and-vaccinations/diabetic-
retina-screening/diabetic-retina-screening.html) . Diabetic retinopathy is a
complication of diabetes that can damage eyesight.

##  Eye health professionals explained

**An Optometrist** examine your eyes to test for vision problems. They use
instruments to examine eye health and to test your visual acuity, depth and
colour perception and your ability to focus and co-ordinate your eyes.
Optometrists can also prescribe spectacles and contact lenses.

**A Dispensing Optician** cannot prescribe prescription spectacles or contact
lenses for you but they can advise you on glasses frames, lenses and contact
lenses for your prescription and your lifestyle.

[ You can check this register for Optometrists and Dispensing Opticians in
your area. ](https://coru.ie/check-the-register/)

**An Ophthalmologist** is a doctor who can perform eye surgery, diagnose and
treat eye diseases and injuries. Ophthalmologists can also examine eyes and
prescribe glasses and contact lenses.

###  Making a complaint about an eye care professional

If you want to make a complaint about a practitioner, you should contact the
regulatory body that they are registered with. Practising optometrists and
dispensing opticians must be registered with the [ Optical Registration Board
at CORU ](https://coru.ie/about-us/registration-boards/optical-registration-
board/) , the [ regulator for health and social care professionals
](/en/health/health-system/registration-of-health-and-social-care-
professionals/) . Ophthalmologists must be registered with the [ Irish Medical
Council ](http://www.medicalcouncil.ie) .
