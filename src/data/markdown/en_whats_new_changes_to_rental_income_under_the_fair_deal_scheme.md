#  Changes to rental income under the Fair Deal scheme

29 January 2024

#####  News

From 1 February 2024, the [ Fair Deal Scheme
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/health/health-services/health-
services-for-older-people/fair-deal-scheme/) financial assessment will change
if you are renting your home while you are in a nursing home. If you rent out
your vacant home, you will be able to keep 100% of the rental income.

At present, if you rent your home, you must pay 40% of this rental income
towards your nursing home care. This means you can keep 60% of the rental
income of your own home. To apply for this currently, you fill in the
Principal Private Residence Rental Income application form and supply your
Residential Tenancies Board registration approval letter, the tenancy
agreement showing the rental amount and your latest notice of assessment from
Revenue.

If the property you are renting is not your own home, you must pay 80% of the
rental income to nursing home care.
