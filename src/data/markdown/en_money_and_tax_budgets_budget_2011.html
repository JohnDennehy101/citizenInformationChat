The main Budget changes which may affect people living in Ireland are set out
below.

This document sets out changes in the areas of social welfare, tax, health,
transport, environment, housing, education, employment and other areas. It is
an overview and not a complete statement of the measures announced in Budget
2011\. **The document will be expanded and updated as information becomes
available** .

Some of the changes announced in the Budget come into effect immediately.
Others take effect from the beginning of January 2011. Many others have to be

change when the Finance Bill is published – this is expected in early 2011.

For a full list of the Budget changes, please read the Department of Finance’s
[ Summary of Budget Measures ](http://www.budget.gov.ie) .

##  Social Welfare

###  Rates of payment

###  Older people

There will be no change in the rates of State pensions or other payments for
those aged over 66, for example, Living Alone Allowance, Household Benefits
Scheme and Fuel Allowance.

###  People of working age

The maximum personal rate of payment for all weekly schemes will be reduced by
€8 per week, except for personal rates for those aged 66 and over, and
Invalidity Pension and State Pension Transition recipients aged 65. Changes
will come into effect from the first week in January 2011.

Associated maximum Increase for a Qualified Adult will generally decrease by
€5.30 per week from the first week in January 2011.

Proportionate decreases will apply to both personal rates and Increase for a
Qualified Adult in respect of people on reduced social insurance rates of
payment.

There will be a decrease of €8 per week in the maximum and minimum rate of
Maternity and Adoptive Benefits.

There will be a reduction of €6 per week in the rate of Jobseeker’s Allowance
and Supplementary Welfare Allowance for those aged 22-24.

The rate of payment of Jobseeker’s Allowance and Supplementary Welfare
Allowance for those aged 18-21 is unchanged.

There will be a reduction of €10 in the personal weekly rate of Supplementary
Welfare Allowance.

###  Fuel Allowance

In response to the current severe weather, a once-off additional 2 weeks
payment will be paid to most recipients in the next few weeks, with the
remainder of recipients getting this payment in early January. This measure
will be worth €40 to recipients.

###  Children

Child Benefit will be reduced by €10 per month from January 2011 on both the
lower and higher rate with an additional €10 per month decrease for the third
child. Grants for multiple births (twins etc.) will not be reduced.

Other child-related payments are unchanged: Qualified Child Increases, Family
Income Supplement, Back to School Footwear and Clothing Allowance, Widowed
Parent Grant and Domiciliary Care Allowance.

###  Carers

The rate of payment will be reduced by €8 for carers aged under 66. Carers
aged 66 or over will not be affected.

There are no other changes to Carer’s schemes: the half-rate payment, the
additional payment for caring for more than one person and the Respite Care
Grant are retained.

###  Rent Supplement

The Rent Supplement Scheme will be reformed in order to control expenditure.
This will include an additional €2 per week contribution by certain welfare
recipients towards the cost of rent. This follows from the reduction in the
rate of Supplementary Welfare Allowance.

###  Treatment Benefits

The Treatment Benefit Scheme will continue to be limited in 2011 to the
Medical and Surgical Appliances scheme and the free examination elements of
the Dental and Optical Benefit schemes.

statement-announcement-joint-eu-imf-programme-ireland) . This reduced rate

](/en/employment/employment-rights-and-conditions/contracts-of-
employment/change-job-contract/) .

of qualifying employers’ PRSI is lower than the reduction in corporation tax
liability otherwise applicable, relief will be based on the lower amount

###  Social welfare pensions

There will be no change to social welfare pension rates.

###  Tax relief on pension contributions

The annual earnings limit on which pension tax relief is applicable is being
reduced from €150,000 (2010) to €115,000 for 2011.

###  Employee pension contributions

Employee contributions to occupational pension schemes and other pension
arrangements will be subject to employee PRSI and the Universal Social Charge
from 1 January 2011

###  Public service pension-related deduction

The pension-related deduction charged to earnings in the public service will
be subject to employee PRSI and the Universal Social Charge from 1 January
2011\.

###  Employer PRSI exemption on pension contributions

The current employer PRSI exemption for employee contributions to occupational
pension schemes and other pension arrangements will be reduced by 50% from 1
January 2011.

###  Maximum allowable pension funds

The maximum allowable pension fund on retirement for tax purposes (known as
the Standard Fund Threshold (SFT)), is to be set at €2.3 million with effect
from 7 December 2010. A higher threshold may apply if, on 7 December 2010, the
capital value of an individual’s pension rights drawn down on or after 7
December 2005 (i.e. crystallised pension rights) when added to any
uncrystallised pension rights the individual may have, as valued on 7 December
2010, are greater than €2.3 million and lower than €5,418,085 which is the
current value of the SFT. This change will apply with effect from 1 January
2011\.

###  Approved Retirement Funds

The annual imputed distribution which applies to the value of assets in an
Approved Retirement Fund (ARF) at 31 December each year is being increased
from 3% to 5% in respect of asset values at 31 December 2010 and future years.
This change will apply with effect from 1 January 2011.

###  Retirement lump sums

The overall life-time limit on the amount of tax-free retirement lump sums
that an individual can draw down from pension arrangements is being reduced to
€200,000. Lump sums over €200,000 will be taxed at the standard income tax
rate (currently 20%) up to €575,000 (25% of the new Standard Fund Threshold).
Anything over this amount will be taxed at the taxpayer’s marginal rate of
income tax.

Tax-free retirement lump sums taken on or after 7 December 2005 will count
towards “using up” the new tax free amount so that if a person has already
taken tax free retirement lump sums of €200,000 or more since 7 December 2005,
any further retirement lump sums paid to them on or after 1 January 2011 will
be taxable. These earlier lump sums will also count towards determining how
much of a lump sum paid on or after Budget day is to be charged at the
standard or marginal tax rate. This change will apply with effect from 1
January 2011.

###  Extension of flexible options on retirement

All members of defined contribution pension arrangements will have access to
flexible options on retirement in respect of the main benefits arising from
those schemes, subject to certain conditions. These will be provided for in
the Finance Bill.

measure. It will be followed in 2013 by a final Site Value Tax, which will be
introduced when valuations have been completed.

###  Water metering

The National Recovery Plan 2011-14 also provides for the roll-out of water
metering to domestic users, with water charges to follow on a metered basis
alongside a free allowance.

###  Travel and Recreation

###  Tax on petrol and diesel

Tax will be increased by 4 cent per litre on petrol and 2 cent per litre on
diesel (both inclusive of VAT) with effect from midnight on 7 December 2010.

###  Passports

Passport fees are to be introduced for those aged 65 or over.

###  Vehicle Registration Tax (VRT)

The car scrappage scheme is being extended for the period 1 January to 30 June
2011. VRT relief of up to €1,250 will be provided where a car of 10 years or
older is scrapped in accordance with certain criteria and a new car of
emissions bands A or B (i.e. with CO2 emissions of 140g/kg or less) is
purchased.

The VRT relief for series production hybrid and flexible fuel vehicles, due to
expire on 31 December 2010, is being extended for 2 years until 31 December
2012, with the rate of relief provided being up to €1,500.

Light commercial vehicles charged VRT at the Category C VRT rate of €50 will,
from 1 January 2011, be charged the Category B rate of 13.3% of the Open
Market Selling Price (OMSP).

###  Travel tax

A single revised rate of air travel tax of €3 will replace the existing two-
rate structure on a temporary basis from 1 March 2011.

###  Growth Incentive Scheme for airlines

The Dublin Airport Authority (DAA) is to introduce a new Growth Incentive
Scheme for airlines operating at Dublin, Cork and Shannon Airports. The
Scheme, which will provide a full rebate of airport charges in respect of
traffic at all three airports above an annual threshold of €23.5m, is to
encourage overall traffic passenger growth at the airports.

###  Offshore betting

It is intended that all bookmakers taking bets from Ireland will pay 1%
betting duty on those bets in the same way that betting shops currently do.

##  Education and training, labour market activation, health, miscellaneous

###  School transport

The school transport charge for post-primary students increases by €50 to €350
per year, with a maximum charge of €650 per family.

A new charge of €50 is introduced for primary school pupils, except for
medical card holders , with a maximum charge of €110 per family.

The charges are subject to an overall maximum charge of €650 per family.

For the school year 2011/2012, the distance criteria will be applied to all
pupils attending primary schools. This means that children who live less than
3.2 kilometres (2 miles) from school, and who get free transport under the
“closed school” rule at present, will lose their transport eligibility.

Services for very small numbers of pupils will be discontinued. A minimum of
10 eligible children (up from 7 at present) will be required to establish or
retain services.

Further changes arising from the recent Value for Money review will take
effect from a later date.

###  Capitation grants

There is a 5% reduction in all capitation grants, including grants for adult
literacy, community education, the School Completion Programme and Youthreach.

###  Student charges

The Student Services Charge for third-level students is replaced by a flat-
rate higher education student contribution of €2,000 per year. Arrangements
will be made to provide that second and subsequent siblings from a single
family will not have to bear the full increased cost of the new €2,000 charge.

It is intended that this contribution will be payable in two instalments.
Students qualifying for third-level grants will not have to pay it.

A new charge of €200 per year is introduced for Post-Leaving Certificate (PLC)
students. Students qualifying for maintenance grants will not have to pay this
charge.

###  Student Support Scheme

The rates of the following grants are reduced by 4% in line with the
reductions in all Department of Social Protection (DSP) working-age payments

  * Higher Education Grants Scheme 
  * Vocational Education Committees' Scholarship Scheme 
  * Third Level Maintenance Grants Scheme for Trainees 
  * Maintenance Grants Scheme for Students Attending Post-Leaving Certificate Courses 

It is expected that these reduced rates will apply to the remaining portions
of grants for the current academic year that are due to be paid in 2011.

The benefits payable to mature students will be limited to those payable to
ordinary students. Mature students will no longer be automatically eligible
for the non-adjacent rate of grant.

The proportion of students qualifying for the non-adjacent rate of grant will
be reduced by changing the qualifying distance between the student’s home and
college from 24km to 45km. It is expected that these changes will take effect
from the 2011/2012 academic year.

###  Funding of third-level institutions

There is a 5% cut in the non-pay grant to institutions such as universities
and institutes of technology.

###  Education for Travellers

Senior Traveller Training Centres (STTCs) will be phased out by June 2012.
Replacement further education places, prioritised for Travellers, will be
provided under the Back to Education Initiative (BTEI). This means that there
will be no new enrolments in STTCs from 1 January 2011.

###  National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS)

The number of psychologists employed by NEPS will be capped at the current
level of 178.

###  FÁS payments

All weekly training allowances and similar support payments paid through FÁS
are reduced by €8 in line with the reductions in all Department of Social
Protection (DSP) working-age payments.

The long-term unemployment bonus paid to students on the Vocational Training
Opportunities Scheme (VTOS) is reduced from €31.80 to €20 per week.

###  Labour market activation programmes

The National Employment Action Plan will be refocused to establish clearer
pathways to employment by ensuring that State agencies interact early and
often with those who have lost their jobs to provide opportunities for
education, training or work experience placements as appropriate.

An additional 15,000 activation places and supports for the unemployed will be
provided under the following programmes:

  * A new Skills Development and Internship Programme will provide up to 5,000 places in the private sector. 
  * The Work Placement Programme will provide up to 5,000 places in the public service. The scheme was recently extended in the Education sector and will be extended further within other sectors over the coming months. 
  * A new Community Work Placement Scheme will provide up to 5,000 additional places in the community and voluntary sector. Participants will work 19.5 hours a week for 12 months and their rate of payment will be the maximum rate of their social welfare payment plus a weekly €20 top up. 

###  Health

###  Hospital charges

There are no increases in the Accident and Emergency (A&E) charge, the
statutory day and inpatient charges, or the monthly threshold for the Drug
Payment Scheme.

###  Charges for Private/Semi Private Treatment in Public Hospitals

If you are in a private bed in a public or voluntary hospital, you must pay
the set rate which changes from time to time. The following charges are in
addition to the public hospital in-patient charges.

###  Income supports

The supplementary Blind Welfare Allowance paid to blind people who receive the
Blind Pension has been reduced to €58.50 from €61.00 for a blind pensioner and
from €122.00 to €117.00 for a blind couple.

###  Disability and mental health

There will be a maximum reduction of 1.8% in the Budget allocation for the two
sectors.

An additional €10 million funding will be provided to the HSE for disability
in 2011. This is to meet anticipated extra demand for emergency residential,
respite and personal assistant/home support hours for people with disabilities
and day places for school leavers in September 2011.

An additional €1m has been provided for suicide prevention. The National
Office for Suicide Prevention (NOSP) will target:

  * Development of the number and range of training and awareness programmes 
  * Improvements and standardised responses to deliberate self harm 
  * Development of the capacity of primary care to respond to suicidal behaviour and consider new models of response 
  * Ensuring that helpline supports for those in emotional distress are coordinated and widely publicised 

###  Older people

Additional funding of €8m for Home Care Packages for approximately 500 extra
recipients at any one time, or up to 800 during the year 2011.

An additional €6m for the Nursing Homes Support Scheme (Fair Deal Scheme) was
announced. This funding takes account of the increasing number of older people
that require long-term nursing home care due to demographic trends.

###  Miscellaneous

###  Public service

The Taoiseach’s salary will be reduced by €14,000, that of the Tánaiste by
€11,000 and the salaries of Ministers by €10,000. The system of State cars
will be reformed to include a pool system for Ministers based in Dublin. Ex-
office holders, such as former Taoisigh will also have a pooling arrangement.
One of the two Government jets will be disposed of.

New entrants to the public service will start at the lowest point of the
revised pay scale. This scale is 10% lower than that currently in operation.
In future, there will be a cap of €250,000 on salaries in the public service
and in semi-State organisations.

There will be cuts in all public service pensions. The cuts will apply to
existing beneficiaries.

**Annual Public Service Pension** |  **Reduction rate**  
---|---  
First €12,000  |  0%   
Between €12,001 and €24,000  |  6%

Balance above €60,001  |  12%   
  
###  New Four-Year National Solidarity Bond

complement the ten-year National Solidarity Bond which was launched last year.
The bond will pay a coupon each year and a bonus for those who hold the bond
to maturity. The bond will be sold by An Post on behalf of the National
Treasury Management Agency (NTMA). Further details will be announced by the
NTMA in the New Year.
