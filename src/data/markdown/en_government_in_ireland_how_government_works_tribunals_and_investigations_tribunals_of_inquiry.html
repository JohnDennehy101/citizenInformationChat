##  Introduction

Ireland's Parliament (Oireachtas) has the power to establish tribunals of
inquiry to investigate certain matters of public importance. If the Government
considers that a particular issue of controversy or dispute is of such public
importance that a [ public inquiry ](/en/government-in-ireland/how-government-
works/tribunals-and-investigations/tribunals-introduction/) is necessary, it
can propose propose a resolution to set up a tribunal of inquiry.

These tribunals are not permanent tribunals. Instead, they are set up with
powers to investigate specific matters. They are usually chaired by judges or
senior lawyers.

At the end of the investigation, the tribunal submits a report to the
Oireachtas, which may contain recommendations.

##  Powers of tribunals of inquiry

To carry out the investigation, the tribunal has certain powers, including the
power to hold public or private hearings. The Oireachtas may decide that any
tribunal that it sets up shall be invested with the powers set out in the
Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Acts 1921 to 2011.

This Act provides that a tribunal can make orders to force witnesses to attend
and give evidence. It also allows the tribunal to apply to the [ High Court
](/en/justice/courts-system/high-court/) if a person refuses to give evidence
or is in contempt of the tribunal.

The High Court may order a witness to give evidence. If he or she continues to
fail to co-operate with the tribunal, the High Court may hold the witness in
contempt of court and have the witness imprisoned until he or she has co-
operated with the tribunal. It is also a criminal offence to refuse to give
evidence or to co-operate with a tribunal.

Any statement or admission made at a tribunal cannot be used in evidence
against a person in criminal proceedings. However, sometimes the findings of
tribunals can give rise to an investigation leading to independent criminal or
civil proceedings.

This means that strict procedures are applied in the course of the tribunals.
Interested parties usually have legal representation, including a solicitor,
and both junior and senior counsel barristers. Witnesses are usually cross-
examined.

##  Costs of tribunals of inquiry

The cost of tribunals of inquiry, including the cost of legal representation
of all interested parties, is usually paid by the State. If the tribunal
considers that there is sufficient reason to do so, it can order any person to
pay the costs of another person appearing before the tribunal or the costs of
the tribunal itself. This may happen if a person fails to co-operate with the
tribunal or gives false or misleading evidence.

##  Recommendations and findings

At the end of the tribunal's investigation, it will submit a report to the
Oireachtas setting out the findings it has made. In many cases, a tribunal of
inquiry will also be given the power to make recommendations with a view to
preventing the same problem happening again. These recommendations may include
suggestions for law reform.

The tribunal's function is purely fact-finding and investigative. Although it
may make recommendations, it does not make a binding judgement on the rights
or liabilities of individuals. It simply states, in its report, the results of
its investigations and the findings of fact it has made.
