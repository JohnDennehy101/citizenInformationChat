##  Introduction

There are different roles involved in owning or working on a farm.

If you’re just getting into farming, there are grants and courses to get you
started.

If you’re already working in farming, there are a variety of supports
available, including farming grants and payments and social welfare supports.

You have a number of responsibilities if you own and run a farm, like paying
taxes. You also have specific responsibilities if you employ people on your
farm.

If you want to retire from farming, you should consider all your options, such
as planning for farm inheritance so you can pass your farm on to your
successor.

This page has information about the supports you can get at the different
stages of your farming life, as well as your responsibilities, especially if
you are employing people on your farm.

##  Starting out in farming

Farming is a varied career and lifestyle. As well as it being your job, you
may also be a business owner, employer and caretaker of the land. And you may
have to work unsociable hours, depending on the type of farming you do.

If you are starting out farming, you may be:

  * [ Inheriting a farm ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/environment/land/farm-succession-planning/#2a56cb) from a relative 
  * Buying a farm 
  * Working on someone else’s farm 

If you are in school and thinking about a career in farming, you should talk
to your school guidance counsellor about courses.

You can also contact [ Teagasc ](https://www.teagasc.ie/) or the universities
that offer farming courses to find out about farming courses and
apprenticeships.

You could also consider working on a farm as a seasonal worker, for example,
during the summer holidays. This is a great way to get experience on a farm to
see if you enjoy it, before you sign up to a course or apprenticeship.

###  **Getting a herd number**

If you are going to keep animals on your farm, you may need a herd number.
These are issued by your [ Regional Veterinary Office (RVO)
](https://www.gov.ie/en/organisation-information/9dc27-contact-us/#regional-
offices) and help to manage diseases in animals.

You also need a herd number to qualify for many of the [ farming grants and
schemes ](/en/environment/land/farming-grants-and-schemes/) . However, scheme
entitlements do not automatically transfer when you change the name on a herd
number. You need to transfer any entitlements separately.

You will need a herd number if you have:

  * Cows 
  * Sheep 
  * Goats 

To qualify for a herd number, [ you must meet certain criteria
](https://www.gov.ie/en/service/f90f21-application-for-a-flockherd-
number/#what-you-must-do) . For example, you must be over 18 and your land
must be properly fenced.

Getting a herd number means you are responsible for the care of the animals
under that herd number. You are seen as the herd keeper; though you do not
have to own animals or land to have a herd number.

**Applying for a herd number**

To apply for a herd number, you must:

  * Complete a [ ER1: Disease Eradication Schemes From (doc) ](https://assets.gov.ie/72636/5c584cad1cfe4ade813cc508271a2e7a.doc)
  * Send it to your local [ Regional Veterinary Office (RVO) ](https://www.gov.ie/en/organisation-information/9dc27-contact-us/#regional-offices)

The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine has [ more information on
applying for a herd number (doc)
](https://assets.gov.ie/72643/9facc725e77149cc9e1c69bf045108f3.doc) .

Gov.ie also have [ more information on herd numbers
](https://www.gov.ie/en/service/f90f21-application-for-a-flockherd-number/) .

##  Education and training

There are lots of farming courses if you are interested in farming or are
already farming and want to upskill or learn about a new area.

You may also need to complete a farming course to access some farming schemes
and payments, such as the [ Organic Farming Scheme
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/environment/land/organic-farming-
scheme/) .

Many farming courses are run by [ Teagasc ](https://www.teagasc.ie/) while
others are run by [ third-level colleges
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/education/third-level-education/fees-
and-supports-for-third-level-education/student-grant-scheme/) , sometimes in
partnership with Teagasc.

There are grants to help you with the cost of studying, including:

  * The [ Teagasc Student Maintenance Grant Scheme ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/environment/land/farming-education-grants-and-supports/#902b22)
  * The [ Student Grant Scheme ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/environment/land/farming-education-grants-and-supports/#35915c)

There are also [ farming apprenticeships
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/environment/land/farming-education-
grants-and-supports/#9edcbd) if you are interested in getting practical
farming experience.

You can [ find out more about farming education, grants and supports
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/environment/land/farming-education-
grants-and-supports/) .

##  Grants and schemes for farmers

There are a number of [ grants and schemes
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/environment/land/farming-grants-and-
schemes/) you can get to subsidise your income, help modernise your farm and
make it more sustainable.

Most schemes have their own qualifying criteria and application process.
However, you can apply for some of the schemes when you [ apply for the Basic
Income Support for Sustainability Scheme (BISS
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/environment/land/basic-income-support-
for-sustainability-scheme-for-farmers/) ).

BISS is the main EU support for farmers. It provides income support for
farming sustainably and aims to ensure farmers can make a living from farming.

Some of the schemes may be closed to new applicants or closed for the year.
However, you should know the terms and conditions of any scheme you are
claiming to make sure you are following the scheme rules.

You can read our page on [ Farming grants and schemes
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/environment/land/farming-grants-and-
schemes/) for more information.

##  Supports for young farmers

There are additional supports for young farmers, including the:

  * [ Complementary Income Support for Young Farmers (CIS-YF) ](https://www.gov.ie/en/service/38d46-complementary-income-support-for-young-farmers/) . This is a payment which supports young farmers who are under 40. 
  * [ National Reserve: Young Farmer category ](https://www.gov.ie/en/service/bb30b-national-reserve-young-farmer-category/) . This provides financial support to farmers who are under 40 and are setting up a farm for the first time. 

To qualify for both of these young farmer supports, you must:

  * Be under 40 years old 
  * Have completed a recognised course in agriculture at Level 6 or equivalent on the National Framework of Qualifications 
  * Submit a valid BISS application 

These young farmer supports are connected to your BISS application.

**Both schemes are** **currently closed to new applicants but are expected to
open again in 2025.**

**Young Trained Farmer Relief**

The Young Trained Farmer Relief means you pay no stamp duty when agricultural
land is transferred to you, if you meet certain criteria.

To qualify, you must:

  * Be under 35 
  * Have a relevant agricultural qualification 
  * Have submitted a business plan to Teagasc 
  * Be registered for income tax 
  * Be the head of the farm holding 

You must also intend to:

  * Spend at least 50% of your normal working time farming the transferred land for at least 5 years from the date of transfer 
  * Keep ownership of the land for at least 5 years from the date of transfer 

There is a limit on the amount of relief that can be claimed.

You can read more information about the [ Young Trained Farmer Relief on
revenue.ie (pdf) ](https://www.revenue.ie/en/tax-professionals/tdm/stamp-
duty/stamp-duty-manual/part-07-exemptions-and-reliefs-from-stamp-
duty/section-81aa-transfers-of-land-to-young-trained-farmers.pdf) .

**Succession Farm Partnerships**

A Succession Farm Partnership is an income tax incentive to encourage
experienced farmers to form partnerships with young, trained farmers and then
transfer ownership of their farm business to them.

The incentive is worth an annual tax credit of €5,000 for up to 5 years.

To qualify for this incentive, you must meet certain criteria, including that,
at least one successor is under 40 years old and has an agricultural
qualification.

For more information on Succession Farm Partnerships, see [ Farm succession
planning (pdf) ](https://www.revenue.ie/en/tax-professionals/tdm/income-tax-
capital-gains-tax-corporation-tax/part-23/23-02-11.pdf) .

##  Social welfare supports for farmers

There are some social welfare payments for farmers that you may be able to get
depending on your situation:

  * [ Farm Assist ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/farming-and-fishing/farm-assist/) – a means-tested social welfare payment for farmers with a low income 
  * The [ Rural Social Scheme ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/farming-and-fishing/rural-social-scheme/) for low-income farmers, fishermen and fisherwomen. This scheme gives you a ‘top-up’ payment on your social welfare payment in return for providing services that benefit your community. 

**Other social welfare supports**

You may also qualify for other social welfare supports which are not
specifically for farmers, such as:

  * [ Fuel Allowance ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/extra-social-welfare-benefits/fuel-allowance/)
  * [ Back to School Clothing and Footwear Allowance ](http://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/social_welfare_payments_to_families_and_children/back_to_school_clothing_and_footwear_allowance.html)
  * [ Jobseeker’s Benefit ](http://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/unemployed_people/jobseekers_benefit.html)
  * [ Jobseeker’s Allowance ](http://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/unemployed_people/jobseekers_allowance.html)

You can find more information about these payments in our [ Social Welfare
section ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/extra-social-
welfare-benefits/fuel-allowance/) .

##  Employing workers on your farm

**Before hiring workers for your farm**

Before you hire anyone to work on your farm, you need to be clear about why
you are employing them. You also need to be sure that your business needs
additional labour and that you can afford to pay for them.

Teagasc has a guide that gives advice on the hiring process: [ Teagasc Farm
Labour Manual – Best Practice in Recruiting and Managing Employees
](https://www.teagasc.ie/media/website/publications/2017/Teagasc-Farm-Labour-
Combined-Book.pdf) .

**Being an employer**

If you are employing people to work on your farm, you must know [ your
responsibilities as an employer
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/employment/employment-rights-and-
conditions/employment-rights-and-duties/employer-obligations/) and make sure
your workers get their basic [ employment rights
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/employment/employment-rights-and-
conditions/pay-and-employment/minimum-wage/) .

For example, you must:

  * Pay at least the [ minimum wage ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/employment/employment-rights-and-conditions/pay-and-employment/minimum-wage/) and provide your workers with payslips 
  * Make sure your workers get a written statement with the terms and conditions of their employment 
  * Make sure your workers get the correct breaks, rest periods and annual leave 
  * Ensure your workers’ [ safety, health and welfare at work ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/employment/employment-rights-and-conditions/health-and-safety/health-safety-work/) , as far as is reasonably practicable 
  * Keep records of the wages you’ve paid, working hours and other information 
  * Deduct the correct amount of tax, PRSI and Universal Social Charge from your employees’ wages and send it to Revenue 

If you employ someone aged between 14 and 18, they are considered a ‘young
worker’ and have specific rights and protections. You can [ find out more
about rights of young workers
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/employment/starting-work-and-changing-
job/young-people-at-work/rights-of-young-workers/) .

If you need advice and support on employment matters, you should contact the [
Workplace Relations Commission ](https://www.workplacerelations.ie/en/) .

##  Taxation for farmers

You are taxed on the profits you make from your farm business and on any other
income you have. Farm profit is the income you earn from farming less your
allowable farming expenses. You are responsible for keeping records and for
assessing the amount of tax due each year.

If you are farming as an individual, you have to pay income tax on your
profits. If you are farming through a company, you have to pay [ Corporation
Tax ](https://www.revenue.ie/en/companies-and-charities/corporation-tax-for-
companies/corporation-tax-payment-and-filing/index.aspx) (CT) on your profits.

You must pay and file your income or corporation tax return each year before
the deadline using the Revenue Online Service (ROS).

###  **Universal Social Charge**

The [ **Universal Social Charge**
](http://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/money_and_tax/tax/income_tax/universal_social_charge.html)
is a tax on income. You must pay it if your gross income (your income before
tax) is more than €13,000 per year. Farm-related capital allowances are
deductible, for example, money spent on buying or maintaining farm buildings.

Find out more about the [ **current rates of USC and exempted income**
](http://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/money_and_tax/tax/income_tax/universal_social_charge.html)
.

###  **PRSI for farmers**

If you are a self-employed farmer, you pay [ **Class S PRSI**
](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social_welfare/irish_social_welfare_system/social_insurance_prsi/class_S_prsi.html&sa=U&ved=0ahUKEwiWmtKYqpncAhWIyKQKHZyZB-
MQFggFMAA&client=internal-uds-
cse&cx=006414847141085406041:ntchszasfve&usg=AOvVaw3G2Hn_jGhtLKHApcwQNuvV) .
When you pay PRSI, you build up entitlements to social insurance benefits.

[ **Class S contributions**
](http://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social_welfare/irish_social_welfare_system/social_insurance_prsi/class_S_prsi.html)
cover you for a limited number of payments. In general, they do not cover you
for any short-term payments including illness and disability payments.

If you satisfy all the other conditions, Class S contributions mean you can
get:

  * [ Maternity Benefit ](http://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/social_welfare_payments_to_families_and_children/maternity_benefit.html)
  * [ Adoptive Benefit ](http://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/social_welfare_payments_to_families_and_children/adoptive_benefit.html)
  * [ Paternity Benefit ](http://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/social_welfare_payments_to_families_and_children/paternity_benefit.html)
  * [ Widow’s, Widower’s or Surviving Civil Partner’s (Contributory) Pension ](http://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/death_related_benefits/widows_contrib_pension.html)
  * [ State Pension (Contributory) ](http://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/older_and_retired_people/state_pension_contributory.html)
  * [ Treatment Benefit Scheme ](http://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/disability_and_illness/treatment_benefit_scheme.html)
  * [ Invalidity Pension ](http://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/disability_and_illness/invalidity_pension.html)

When you are self-employed, you register for self-assessment with Revenue and
you are automatically registered for PRSI. When you submit your annual tax
return, Revenue will let you know if you have to pay PRSI.

If you do not have to pay PRSI, you may be able to pay voluntary contributions
to maintain your social insurance record.

You can read more about the [ **current rules and rates for Class S PRSI**
](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social_welfare/irish_social_welfare_system/social_insurance_prsi/class_S_prsi.html&sa=U&ved=0ahUKEwiWmtKYqpncAhWIyKQKHZyZB-
MQFggFMAA&client=internal-uds-

**.** The Department of Social Protection (DSP) also has a useful leaflet on [
PRSI for the Self-Employed ](http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/PRSI-for-the-Self-
Employed---SW-74.aspx) .

If your spouse or partner is helping you on the farm, they are eligible to
make PRSI contributions and to gain PRSI benefits. You can read more about [
employing family members and PRSI
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-
system/social-insurance-prsi/social-insurance/#90d8ef) .

###  **Tax reliefs and allowances for farmers**

There are many tax reliefs and allowances for farmers which may help to reduce
the amount of tax you pay.

**Income from long-term leasing**

If you lease land on a long-term lease, the income you get from this may be
exempt from tax up to a certain threshold. To qualify, the lease must be in
writing and for 5 years or more. Leases between close relatives do not qualify
for the relief. For more information, see [ leasing farm land on revenue.ie
](https://www.revenue.ie/en/personal-tax-credits-reliefs-and-exemptions/land-
and-property/leasing-farm-land/index.aspx) .

**The Succession Farm Partnership Scheme**

The [ Succession Farm Partnership Scheme
](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/2d52c-guidance-for-farmers-on-succession-
farm-partnerships/) is a tax incentive for entering an approved partnership
with your successor which involves transferring of at least 80% of the farm
assets to them.

**Capital Acquisitions Tax Agricultural relief**

Agricultural property that is given as a gift or inherited can have its market
value reduced by 90% for tax calculation purposes. The person getting the
property must either be an active farmer or someone who is leasing out the
property on a long-term basis for agricultural use to active farmers.

You can read [ Revenue's guidelines on the relief (pdf)
](https://www.revenue.ie/en/tax-professionals/tdm/capital-acquisitions-
tax/cat-part11.pdf) for more information.

##  Retiring from farming

###  **Farm Succession Planning**

[ Farm succession planning ](/en/environment/land/farm-succession-planning/)
is the process of planning how you will transfer your farm to another person
when you retire or step back from farming. The plan covers how you will
transfer ownership of the farm, but can also involve transferring skills,
knowledge, and labour.

This can be a complex process, so you need to plan it carefully to avoid
family disputes and ensure you maximise any incentives.

You should also give yourself plenty of time to make the plan, as issues such
as paying into a pension for your retirement need to begin well before
transferring your farm.

**Get advice**

You should talk to your farm advisor first. They have a good understanding of
how your farm business works and have experience of other farm transfers so
can help with the process. They will also let you know how the transfer will
affect any schemes and at what stage you will need a solicitor and accountant.

**Talk to your family**

You should also make sure you include the whole family in the process. It can
be helpful to have an open discussion about who wants what before you make a
plan. More than one child may want to inherit the farm while in certain
situations, none of your children may want it.

If you are transferring the farm to one child, you may want to make other
arrangements for your other children to make sure they all benefit. For
example, giving a child who is not getting the farm a site or financial help.

**Plan for your retirement**

You will need to consider how you will manage financially when you transfer
the farm. For example, will you be old enough to get the [ old-age pension
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/older-and-retired-
people/state-pension-contributory/) or a [ private pension
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/money-and-tax/personal-
finance/pensions/personal-pensions/) , or will you still get an income from
the farm? You may also need to consider housing arrangements if you are
currently living on the farm.

##  Farm inheritance

There are different steps involved in inheriting a farm.

You can transfer your farm while you are alive, or you can arrange to have it
transferred after you die. To do this, you will need to [ make a will
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/death/before-a-death/making-a-will/) .

If you don’t make a will, your assets will be shared out following the
standard rules. These rules state:

  * Your spouse gets two thirds of your assets 
  * Your children get a third 

This may not suit you if for example, you are planning to transfer your farm
to a child.

Visit our page on ‘ [ Making a will
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/death/before-a-death/making-a-will/) ’
to find out more about how to make a will, and [ what happens if you don’t
make one ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/death/before-a-death/making-
a-will/#lf53d1) .

###  **What should I do if I inherit a farm?**

If you inherit a farm, you may have to pay [ Capital Acquisitions Tax
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/money-and-tax/tax/capital-
