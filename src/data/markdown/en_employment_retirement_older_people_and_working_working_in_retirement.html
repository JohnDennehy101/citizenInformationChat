##  Can I get a new job after I retire?

In general, people over the age of 65 can be employed or self-employed.

Some jobs have a _statutory upper age limit_ , for example, members of the
Garda Síochána must retire by 60. Even if you were subject to a statutory
retirement age in your previous job, you can take up a different job or self-
employment when you retire.

If you have taken early retirement, you can take up another job or become
self-employed. Many people over the "normal" retirement age of 65 continue
working past this age.

Before you decide to work in retirement, you should read about the possible
impact on your pension, social welfare payments, and tax obligations.

##  Impact on your public sector pension

If you retired from a public sector job and you are considering returning to
work, your pension may be affected.

###  Returning to work in the public sector

If you were a permanent and pensionable public servant, your pension may be
_abated_ if you go back to work in the public sector.

In general, _abatement_ means your pension is reduced. This is to make sure
you do not earn more between the pension and the income from employment, than
you would otherwise earn if you had stayed in your original employment. The
exact conditions of abatement may differ from one pension scheme to another.

It is generally not possible to contribute more to your public sector
occupational pension scheme after the normal age of retirement.

###  Choosing to work in the private sector

If you are getting a public service pension and you go to work in the private
sector, your pension is not affected.

##  Impact on your private sector pension

If you are getting an [ occupational pension ](/en/money-and-tax/personal-
finance/pensions/occupational-pensions/) , you can work or be self-employed.
Working or being self-employed does not usually affect private pension
schemes.

If you are employed, you may be able to continue contributing to an employment
pension scheme. While most occupational pension schemes do not accept
contributions over the age of 65, some do. You can get tax relief on your
pension contributions up to age 70.

###  Setting up a personal pension

If you are self-employed, or if your new employment does not include an
occupational pension, you can set up a [ personal pension ](/en/money-and-
tax/personal-finance/pensions/personal-pensions/) . You can get tax relief on
your pension contributions up to age 75.

##  Impact on your social welfare payments

If you are getting a social welfare payment, working can affect your
entitlement. The only exceptions are the [ State Pension (Contributory
](/en/social-welfare/older-and-retired-people/state-pension-contributory/) )
and the [ Widow's, Widower's or Surviving Civil Partner's (Contributory)
Pension ](/en/social-welfare/death-related-benefits/widowed-persons-contrib-
pension/) , which are not affected by working in retirement.

You should [ contact your local Intreo centre
](https://www.gov.ie/en/directory/category/e1f4b5-intreo-offices/) for
information and advice.

##  Jobseeker's Benefit or Allowance

You may be able to do some part-time work and keep your entitlement to part of
your [ Jobseeker's Benefit ](/en/social-welfare/unemployed-people/jobseekers-
benefit/) or [ Jobseeker's Allowance ](/en/social-welfare/unemployed-
people/jobseekers-allowance/) .

##  Social insurance (PRSI) contributions

Depending on your age, you may have to pay PRSI (social insurance
contributions) if you work in retirement.

###  If you are under 70

From 1 January 2024, if you are aged under 70 and you are employed or self-
employed, you pay PRSI in the normal way. There are some exceptions – see more
below.

This applies to all types of workers, regardless of what you did earlier. For
example, if you are a former public servant and you take up a job in the
private sector, you have to pay full PRSI. In these circumstances, you may be
able to qualify for a [ pro-rata State contributory pension
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/social-welfare-
payments/older-and-retired-people/state-pension-contributory/) .

You only pay PRSI on your income from employment or self-employment. You do
not have to pay PRSI on your pension from a former employment.

####  **Exceptions**

The changes above do not apply if you are either:

  * Already getting the State Pension (Contributory) 
  * Aged 66 or older, by 1 January 2024 (you were born before 1 January 1958) 

If you are 66 or older by 1 January 2024, you are not affected by the changes
in PRSI status. You do not pay PRSI on your income and your employer continues
to pay Class J at the 0.5% rate.

####  Part-time or low-paid work

If you take up part-time work or low-paid work, you are still in the PRSI
system but you may not have to pay anything. If you earn less than €352 a
week, you don't have to pay PRSI. If you earn over €38, your employer has to
pay and you have full cover.

Once you step over the €352 limit, you must pay PRSI on all your income from
work. A [ PRSI credit ](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/social-
insurance-prsi/paying-social-insurance/) reduces the amount of PRSI payable
for people earning between €352.01 and €424 per week. The credit is tapered
and the amount of the credit depends on your earnings.

###  If you are over 70

You do not have to pay PRSI contributions after the age of 70, whether or not
you are employed or self-employed.

If you do not have enough contributions at age 70, you cannot add to them
after that. Unlike some occupational pension arrangements, you cannot
retrospectively pay PRSI contributions.

If you are over 70 and in employment, your employer pays a small PRSI
contribution to cover you for occupational injuries. This is called [ Class J
social insurance ](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/social-
insurance-prsi/social-insurance-classes/) .

##  Universal social charge

You must pay the [ Universal Social Charge (USC) ](/en/money-and-
tax/tax/income-tax/universal-social-charge/) if your _gross income_ (your
total pay before any money is deducted) is more than €13,000 per year. You do
not pay USC on social welfare or similar payments.

If you are aged 70 or over and your total income for the year is €60,000 or
less, you pay a reduced rate of USC.

Reduced rates also apply to certain medical card holders under 70.

##  Income tax

Income tax applies to almost all income. People aged 65 and over are subject
to the same general tax rules as everyone else, but they do get certain tax
exemption limits.

Read about [ specific tax arrangements for people aged over 65 ](/en/money-
and-tax/tax/income-tax-credits-and-reliefs/older-peoples-tax-credits-and-
reliefs/) , including the taxation of occupational pensions and the [ taxation
of social welfare payments ](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-
system/claiming-a-social-welfare-payment/applying-for-a-social-welfare-
payment/) .

##  Your employment rights

If you are an older worker, whether full or part-time, you are protected by
legislation. This is because most legislation dealing with employment rights
does not have an upper age limit. The law protects you in the following areas:

  * [ Information about your terms and conditions of employment ](/en/employment/employment-rights-and-conditions/contracts-of-employment/contract-of-employment/)
  * [ Holidays and leave ](/en/employment/employment-rights-and-conditions/leave-and-holidays/annual-leave/)
  * [ National minimum wage ](/en/employment/employment-rights-and-conditions/pay-and-employment/minimum-wage/)
  * [ Maximum working hours ](/en/employment/employment-rights-and-conditions/hours-of-work/working-hours/) , [ rest periods ](/en/employment/employment-rights-and-conditions/hours-of-work/work-breaks-and-rest-periods/) , Sunday working, [ night working ](/en/employment/employment-rights-and-conditions/hours-of-work/night-work/)
  * [ Health and safety at work ](/en/employment/employment-rights-and-conditions/health-and-safety/health-safety-work/)
  * [ Minimum notice ](/en/employment/starting-work-and-changing-job/changing-job/giving-notice/) \- the amount of notice is related to the length of service 

If you [ lose your job ](/en/employment/unemployment-and-redundancy/losing-
your-job/losing-your-job/) and your employer owes you money for arrears of
pay, holidays and a number of other items, you may claim this from the Social
Insurance Fund.

###  Equality

Under the Employment Equality Acts 1998-2015, you cannot be discriminated
against based on your age (with certain exceptions). This applies everyone
over the age of 16.

You can read more about [ age equality in employment
](/en/employment/retirement/older-people-and-working/age-equality-in-
employment/) .

###  Unfair dismissal

Under the Unfair Dismissals Acts, dismissal on the grounds of age is unfair
(with certain exceptions). However, you cannot claim unfair dismissal if you
leave employment after reaching the retirement age stated in your contract.

If you are [ unfairly dismissed ](/en/employment/unemployment-and-
redundancy/dismissal/unfair-dismissal/) , at whatever age, you may complain to
the Workplace Relations Commission using their [ online complaint form
](https://www.workplacerelations.ie/en/e-complaint_form/) .

###  Redundancy

If you are made redundant you may be entitled to a [ redundancy payment
](/en/employment/unemployment-and-redundancy/redundancy/redundancy-payments/)
.

You can contact the Workplace Relations Commission’s information and customer
service for more information:
