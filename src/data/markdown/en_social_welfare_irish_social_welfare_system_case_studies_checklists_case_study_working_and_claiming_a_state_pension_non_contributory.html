#  Case study: Working and claiming a State Pension (Non-Contributory)

  * Working and claiming a State Pension (Non-Contributory) 

##  Working and claiming a State Pension (Non-Contributory)

###  This case study shows the effect of work on a State Pension (Non-
Contributory), using 2024 rates

###  Case study

Joe is 67 years of age and has been claiming a State Pension (Non-
Contributory) for over a year. He gets an increase in his payment for his
wife, Jean.

Jean is 62 years old and works part-time as a bookkeeper. She earns €130 a
week (net). Net earnings are total earnings after deductions, such as [ PRSI
](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/social-insurance-prsi/social-
insurance/) , superannuation and union fees.

They have no other income, but they have savings of €56,000.

Currently, Joe's pension payment is the maximum State Pension (Non-
Contributory) €441.70. This is the maximum personal rate of €266, plus the
increase for a qualified adult of €175.70.

Joe and Jean’s total weekly income is currently €571.70.

####  Changes to their circumstances

Joe has been offered some part-time work as a caretaker in a local school. If
he takes the job, his net weekly wage will be €260.

Jean is thinking of increasing the number of hours she works. Her new net
weekly income would be €206.

Joe wants to know how his State Pension (Non-Contributory) will be affected if
he starts work in the local school and Jean increases the number of days she
works.

####  Joe and Jean's new assessable means

The table below shows how to calculate Joe and Jean’s new weekly income:

**Step 1: Find Joe and Jean’s total assessable income** Joe's assessable
income from work (see note 1 below): €60  **Add** Jean's assessable income
from work (see note 2): €6  **Add** income from savings (see note 3): €16
Total: **** €82  
---  
**Step 2: Calculate 50% (half) of Joe and Jean’s total assessable means** €82
divided by 2 = €41 (see note 4 below)  So, the total assessable weekly means
**** is **€41** .  
**Step 3: Find Joe’s new weekly rate of State Pension (Non Contributory)** As
the couple have weekly means of €41, Joe's personal rate of pension changes to
€253.30 (see note 5 below).  His weekly increase for a qualified adult changes
to €167.40.  So, Joe’s new weekly State Pension (Non-Contributory) is
**€420.90** .  
**Step 4: Find the couple’s new total weekly income** Joe's State Pension
(Non-Contributory): €420.90  Add Joe’s weekly income from work: €260  Add
Jean’s weekly income from work: €206  The couple’s new total weekly income
will be €886.90.  
  
###  **Note 1: Joe's assessable income from work**

Joe will earn €260 (net) per week. He can earn up to €200 per week from
employment [ without it affecting his State Pension (Non-contributory)
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/social-welfare-
payments/older-and-retired-people/state-pension-non-contributory/#c25dd5) .

As €200 is not taken into account for the means test, Joe’s assessable income
from work is €60.

###  **Note 2: Jean’s assessable income from work**

Jean will earn €206 (net) per week. As a spouse, she can earn up to €200 per
week [ without it affecting Joe’s State Pension (Non-contributory)
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/social-welfare-
payments/older-and-retired-people/state-pension-non-contributory/#c25dd5) .

As €200 is not taken into account for the means test, Jean's assessable income
from work is €6.

###  **Note 3: Income from savings for a couple**

Joe and Jean’s income from savings is calculated as follows:

First €40,000  |  Nil   
---|---  
Next €20,000  |  €1 per €1,000 per week   
Next €20,000  |  €2 per €1,000 per week   
Excess €80,000  |  €4 per €1,000 per week   
  
John and Jean have savings of €56,000. The first €40,000 is not taken into
account for the means test, but the remaining €16,000 is taken into account.
So, their assessable income from savings is €16.

###  Note 4

If you are married, in a civil partnership, or cohabiting, your total means as
a couple are halved. Read more about [ assessing the means of a couple for
social assistance payments ](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-
system/means-test-for-social-welfare-payments/assessing-the-means-of-a-
couple/) .

###  Note 5

Joe's new personal rate of State Pension (Non-Contributory) is €253.50. He
also gets an extra amount or increase of €167.40 for Jean as a qualified
adult. See [ the rates of pension paid after means are assessed
](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/6aec4d-current-rates-of-payment-for-
social-welfare-payments-sw19/) .
