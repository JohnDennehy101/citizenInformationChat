#  Capital taxes following separation, divorce or dissolution

  * Introduction 
  * Capital Gains Tax 
  * Capital Acquisitions Tax 
  * Stamp Duty 

##  Introduction

When spouses or civil partners decide to separate and the separation is likely
to be permanent, it can affect the way they are taxed.

Here we explain the implications on capital taxes for separating married
couples or civil partners. You can also read about [ how income tax is
affected by separation or divorce ](/en/money-and-tax/tax/income-tax-credits-
and-reliefs/separation-divorce-and-tax-reliefs/) .

For cohabiting couples who are separating, read about [ Taxation of cohabiting
couples ](/en/money-and-tax/tax/income-tax/tax-and-cohabiting-couples/) .

##  Capital Gains Tax

You dispose of an asset when you:

  * Sell it 
  * Give it as a gift 
  * Exchange it 
  * Get compensation or insurance for it 

If you dispose of an asset that has increased in value since you got it, the
increase is taxable under [ Capital Gains Tax (CGT)
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/money-and-tax/tax/capital-
taxes/capital-gains-tax/) .

Transfers of assets between spouses or civil partners are exempt from CGT.

Transfers of assets between spouses or civil partners who are separated are
also exempt from CGT if the transfer is made under a  deed of separation  or a
court order.

Transfers of assets between spouses or civil partners following a court order
in a [ decree of divorce ](/en/birth-family-relationships/separation-and-
divorce/divorce-decrees/) or [ decree of dissolution ](/en/birth-family-
relationships/separation-and-divorce/getting-a-dissolution/) are also exempt
from CGT. Transfers after the granting of a decree are not exempt if they are
not ordered by the court.

Separating couples should seek specialist tax advice before entering into
arrangements that have Capital Gains Tax implications.

##  Capital Acquisitions Tax

If you get a gift or inheritance, you may have to pay [ Capital Acquisitions
Tax (CAT) ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/money-and-tax/tax/capital-
taxes/capital-acquisitions-tax/) .

Gifts or inheritances you get from your spouse or civil partner are exempt
from CAT. This exemption is not affected if you are separated but it is
affected by a divorce or dissolution.

CAT does not apply to a property transfer between a separated or divorced
couple if it is ordered by a court

Separating couples should seek specialist tax advice before entering into
arrangements that have Capital Acquisitions Tax implications.

##  Stamp Duty

Stamp duty is tax you pay when you transfer property. .

Transfers of property between spouses or civil partners are exempt from stamp
duty.

If spouses or civil partners are separated or divorced, transfers of property
which are ordered by a court are exempt from stamp duty.

Read [ more information about stamp duty ](/en/housing/owning-a-home/buying-a-
home/stamp-duty/) .
