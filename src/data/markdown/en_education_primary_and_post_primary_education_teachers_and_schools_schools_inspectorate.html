##  What is a school inspection?

All State primary and post-primary schools in Ireland are inspected by the
Department of Education on a regular basis. An inspection is carried out to
ensure that educational standards in schools are maintained.

The Department has a special division called the Inspectorate that carries out
school inspections. The [ Education Act (1998)
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1998/en/act/pub/0051/index.html) sets out the
responsibilities of the Inspectorate.

The Inspectorate

  * Evaluates and reports on the quality of education provision 
  * Inspects and evaluates education provision at primary and post-primary school 
  * Advises those working in the education system 
  * Contributes to the development of education policy 

The Inspectorate also evaluates the educational services for students with
special educational needs. This is separate to the role of the [ National
Council for Special Education ](http://www.ncse.ie/) (NCSE) which helps
improve co-ordination between education and health to provide special
education.

The [ Child and Family Agency ](https://www.tusla.ie/) is responsible for
assessing [ education provision for children who are not attending school
](https://www.tusla.ie/tess/information-for-schools/) .  

##  What types of school inspection are there?

The Inspectorate carries out inspections in schools and centres for education
and reports on these school inspections.

The inspections can include:

  * Curriculum evaluations 
  * Whole School Evaluation 
  * Child protection and safeguarding 
  * Follow-through inspections look at how the school has implemented inspection recommendations 

**Whole School Evaluations (WSE)**

Whole School Evaluations (WSE) are carried out in both primary and post-
primary schools. A WSE assesses the quality of school management, teaching and
learning at a school and assesses the school’s planning and self-review. The
inspectorate may hold pre-evaluation meetings with staff and management, meet
with the parents’ association and make school and classroom visits.

The inspectorate prepares a draft report and holds meetings with staff and
management before finalising and issuing the Whole School Evaluation.

##  Inspection reports

You can find [ inspection reports for individual schools

reports/?school_roll_number=&report_title=&school_level=Post+Primary&school_level=Primary&school_level=Special+Education&report_date_from_day=&report_date_from_month=&report_date_from_year=&report_date_to_day=&report_date_to_month=&report_date_to_year=)
