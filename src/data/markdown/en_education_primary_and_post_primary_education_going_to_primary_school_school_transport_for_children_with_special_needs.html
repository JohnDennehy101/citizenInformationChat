#  School transport for children with special needs

  * Introduction

  * Is there a charge for special needs school transport? 
  * How to apply for special needs school transport 
  * Where to apply 

##  Introduction

The [ Department of Education ](http://www.education.ie) provides school
transport services for [ children with special educational needs.
](/en/education/special-education-needs/special-education/)

Bus Éireann (the State public transport operator) operates the school
transport service on behalf of the Department. The school transport service
may not be available in all areas. Where the transport cannot be provided, you
may be eligible for a Special Transport Grant to help with the cost of making
private transport arrangements.

**If your school transport service has not started**

If you have a school transport ticket and your service has not started, you
may get an Exceptional No Service Interim Grant. The grant is to help with the
cost of transport to school while you are waiting for your school transport to
start.

The grant is based on the number of days your child attends school from the
date the service was due to start up to the date the service actually starts.
It will be paid after your school transport service starts and at the same
rate as the Special Transport Grant – see ‘Rates’ below.

The Department will contact you directly about the grant.

##  Who can use special needs school transport?

The [ School Transport Scheme (pdf)
](https://assets.gov.ie/45227/d922064305f44236b0ae2748ff194fbb.pdf) applies to
children with a special educational needs recognised by the Department of
Education. The child must be attending the nearest recognised mainstream
school or special class/special school or a unit resourced to meet their
special educational needs.

If your application has been refused, you are entitled to appeal the decision.
You can appeal to the School Transport Appeals Board online on the [ School
Transport Appeals ](https://www.schooltransportappeals.ie/) website. Appeals
can be made:

  * If the Department is not in a position to provide a transport service due to excessive cost 
  * Where the maximum level of grant offered does not cover the assessed cost of the journey involved. 

###  Escort provision

The Special Educational Needs Organiser (SENO) can make an application to the
Department to employ an escort to accompany a child, if the child’s care and
safety needs require that support.

###  Special class arrangements

Transport services for children with special needs are only provided for the
period of enrolment in a special class. If the child returns to mainstream
classes, special transport arrangements will not be provided.

Eligible children who are enrolled in an autism class/unit attached to a
mainstream school and who subsequently mainstream in that school will retain
their transport eligibility for the duration of their primary education in
this school. However, a new application must be made if they transfer to a new
school.

##  Is there a charge for special needs school transport?

Eligible children do not pay a charge for school transport.

A Special Transport Grant towards the cost of private transport arrangements
may be provided at the discretion of the Department in certain situations.

Special Transport Grant rates are as follows:

Kilometres (km)  |  Rate per km   
---|---  
Up to 6437  |  39.12 cent   
Over 6437  |  21.22 cent   
  
##  How to apply for special needs school transport

You should apply to the school principal who will contact the school’s [
Special Educational Needs Organiser (SENO) ](https://ncse.ie/special-
educational-needs-organiser-seno) about applying for special transport. If the
SENO is satisfied that your child is enrolled in the nearest suitable school,
and that school transport is required, a recommendation will be sent to the
School Transport Section of the Department of Education.

[ Applications for Special Transport Grant (pdf) ](https://ncse.ie/wp-
content/uploads/2018/05/SEN-School-Transport-Application-Form.doc) may also be
forwarded to the School Transport Section through the SENO, before to your
child’s enrolment in school. If grant aid is sanctioned, applications for
payment of the grant should include a completed [ Statement of Attendance form
](https://ncse.ie/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/NCSE-Form-6-Student-Attendance-
Confirmation-Form-2021-SS-1.doc) . Applications may be made at the end of the
school year by the parent or guardian of the child to the School Transport
Section.
