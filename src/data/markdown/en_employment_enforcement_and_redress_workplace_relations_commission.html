information/info_cust_serv/) .

.

##  Resolving disputes

###  Conciliation Service

The Conciliation Service helps employers and their employees to resolve
disputes when they have failed to reach agreement during their own previous
negotiations.

A WRC Industrial Relations Officer acts as chairperson during meetings to
negotiate an agreement. The majority of the cases referred to conciliation are
settled. If no agreement is reached, the parties can refer the dispute to the
[ Labour Court ](https://www.labourcourt.ie/en/) .

####  **How to apply**

You can make a referral requests for assistance and enquiries in writing to
the Conciliation Service of the WRC at the Workplace Relations Commission at
the address below or by using the WRC [ conciliation referral form
](https://www.workplacerelations.ie/en/Contact_Us/Conciliation_Referral_Form/)
.

###  Mediation Service

Mediation is a voluntary process which needs agreement from both parties to
participate and to work towards resolving the problem. It makes sure all the
sides are heard and the participants are involved in finding an agreed
solution.

####  Employment rights issues

The WRC may offer a mediation service to try to resolve employment rights
complaints or disputes without the use of adjudication. They may only be
referred for mediation with the agreement of both parties to the complaint or
dispute. Where a complaint or dispute is not resolved, it will be referred for
adjudication. Find out more about [ workplace mediation
](/en/employment/enforcement-and-redress/workplace-mediation/) .

If you have made a complaint about your employment rights and you have agreed
to participate in mediation you may be offered the Early Resolution Service
(ERS) which is part of the Mediation Service. The ERS contacts the parties to
the dispute by phone with the aim of mediating a resolution. If the dispute is
not resolved by the service, your complaint will be sent to the adjudication
service.

**Internal workplace issues**

The Workplace Mediation Service aims to resolve workplace disputes and
disagreements, particularly between individuals or small groups.The service is
provided by officers of the WRC Conciliation and Advisory Services. This is a
confidential service, which gives employees and employers who are in dispute
an opportunity to work with a mediator to find a mutually agreed solution.
Problems referred to this service include breakdown in a working relationship
or issues arising from a grievance and disciplinary procedure.

####  How to apply

You can apply for mediation using the WRC [ online mediation referral form
](https://www.workplacerelations.ie/en/Contact_Us/Mediation_Referral_Form/) .

###  Adjudication Service

The Adjudication Service investigates disputes, grievances and claims that
individuals or small groups of workers make under the employment legislation
listed in [ Schedule 5 of the Workplace Relations Act
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2015/act/16/schedule/5/enacted/en/html) .
Adjudicators are independent in their decision making and have a wide range of
functions under this employment legislation.

**Recent procedural changes**

Following a Supreme Court judgment, [ the law
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2021/act/29/enacted/en/print) covering
certain WRC procedures has been updated. The changes impact adjudication
hearings and are effective from 29 July 2021.

##  Inspecting workplaces for breaches of employment rights

The Inspection Services monitor employment conditions to ensure employers
comply with employment rights legislation. The service is also responsible for
enforcement of breaches.

They also carry out inspections and gather information in relation to other
employment laws. For example, employees or interested parties may ask for an
inspection in relation to the protection of young people in employment.
