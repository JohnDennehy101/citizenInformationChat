system and similar.

Google may store data on servers outside the European Union or European
Economic Area. We have ensured appropriate safeguards are in place to protect
the privacy and integrity of this data.

collect information about how visitors to citizensinformation.ie use the
website. Matomo is hosted on a Citizens Information Board server.
