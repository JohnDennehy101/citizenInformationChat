in your journey through the Criminal Justice System as we can inform you and
we provide many servic ![](https://advic.ie/wp-

late to seek assistance, please do not hesitate to contact us as we can help
with many issues including referral to our subsidised counselling.

AdVIC receives funding from the _Tusla_ and the _Commission for the Support of
Victims of Crime_ . We also receive donations from the public and families
bereaved by homicide.

AdVIC is very grateful to the Commission for the Support of Victims of Crime ,
to Tusla and to the many families who have over the years held fundraising
events for AdVIC. Both the State Funding and the Families Donations have made
it possible for AdVIC to provide their support and services including the
nationwide counselling service.

##  Feedback from some of our members…

I think you do a great job  
Keep it like this group  
Confidentiality, honesty and open minded

I cannot think of anything that I would change  
I felt every aspects of your loss was covered  
In a sensitive and compassionate way

The way things are with this group is spot on  
I hope the next people who come to AdVIC get what I got  
The best support anyone could ask for  
And for this I thank AdVIC , long may it run

Being able to be more vocal  
Being understood by everyone  
It gave me strength
