##  Introduction

The United Kingdom left the European Union on 31 January 2020.

UK citizens continue to have the protection of the [ Common Travel Area
](/en/government-in-ireland/ireland-and-the-uk/common-travel-area-between-
ireland-and-the-uk/) between Ireland and the UK. The [ British and Irish
governments have agreed
](https://www.dfa.ie/media/dfa/eu/brexit/brexitandyou/Joint-Statement-CTA.pdf)
that the provisions of this agreement continue now that the UK has left the
EU.

##  Rights of UK citizens in Ireland after 31 December 2020

UK citizens can live and work in Ireland without restriction.

If you are a UK citizen living in Ireland, you have many of the same rights
and entitlements as an Irish citizen. UK citizens can:

  * Enter Ireland without a visa 
  * Travel between the UK and Ireland 
  * Work without an employment permit 
  * Access the public healthcare system 
  * Vote in general elections 

These rights are based on a series of bilateral agreements between Ireland and
the UK that started in 1922. You can read more about the [ Common Travel Area
between Ireland and the United Kingdom ](/en/government-in-ireland/ireland-
and-the-uk/common-travel-area-between-ireland-and-the-uk/) .

In May 2019, the Irish and British governments [ re-affirmed their commitment
to maintaining the Common Travel Area
](https://www.dfa.ie/media/dfa/eu/brexit/brexitandyou/Joint-Statement-CTA.pdf)
.

The Common Travel Area is separate from EU law, and continues to apply since
the UK left the EU on 31 January 2020.

###  What about my non-EEA family?

The rules for non-EEA family members of UK nationals who want to live in
Ireland are different depending on whether they were living in Ireland before
the transition period or not.

##  Non-EEA family who lived in Ireland before 31 December 2020

If you are a family member of a UK national and you lived in Ireland legally
before 31 December 2020, you retain your residence rights in Ireland. This
means that you can continue to live, work or study in Ireland.

However, you must [ exchange your current valid Irish Resident Permit (IRP)
Card for a new one ](https://www.irishimmigration.ie/wp-
content/uploads/2021/05/UK-withdrawal-from-EU.pdf) stating that these
residence rights derive from EU Free Movement under the Withdrawal Agreement.
The deadline for exchanging your IRP was 30 June 2022.

##  Non-EEA family who came to Ireland after 1 January 2021

Separate arrangements have been put in place for UK nationals who come to
Ireland after 31 December 2020 and wish to bring their non-EEA family members.

You have to apply for a visa or for preclearance (if you are from a country
whose citizens [ do not need a visa to enter Ireland ](/en/moving-
country/visas-for-ireland/visa-requirements-for-entering-ireland/) ).

###  Sponsors

You must have a sponsor for your application. A sponsor must be:

  * A UK citizen 
  * Living in Ireland, or intending to live in Ireland 
  * Able to support you financially 

The sponsor must not have been mainly relying on social welfare payments in
the 2 year period before your application. Also, they must have gross earnings
(before tax and deductions) above the [ Working Family Payment rates
](/en/social-welfare/social-welfare-payments/social-welfare-payments-to-
families-and-children/family-income-supplement#l2b73a) for your family size in
each of the last 3 years.

If you are the spouse or partner of the sponsor, they cannot have sponsored
anyone else for residence in Ireland in the 7 years before your application.

Immigration Service Delivery (ISD) can also consider the conduct of the
sponsor in Ireland (for example, if they have a criminal record).

###  Who can apply?

Your application is based on the relationship you have with the UK citizen
sponsor. There are 3 categories of applicants:

**Category 1** –Spouses, civil partners and de facto partners. A de facto
partnership is when a couple lives together or is in a relationship that is
like a marriage, but they are not married.

**Category 2** –Dependent children. This can be the child of the sponsor, or
the child of their spouse, civil partner or de-facto partner.

**Category 3** –Dependent parents who are 66 or older. This can be the parent
or parents of the sponsor, or of their spouse, civil partner or de-facto
partner.

###  How to apply

To apply to come to Ireland as the family member of a UK citizen you must:

  1. [ Apply for a visa ](https://www.visas.inis.gov.ie/AVATS/OnlineHome.aspx) if you need one, or for [ preclearance ](https://www.visas.inis.gov.ie/AVATS/OnlineHome.aspx) if you do not need a visa 
  2. Pay a fee of €60 
  3. Submit your application and supporting documents 

[ Detailed guidance ](https://www.irishimmigration.ie/coming-to-join-family-
in-ireland/joining-your-uk-national-family-member/) on how to complete the
application form, what supporting documents you should provide, and where to
how to pay the fee are available on the ISD website.

If your application is approved you will get a preclearance letter of approval
(if you not visa required) or a ‘D’ long stay visa in your passport. This
gives you permission to enter Ireland.

When you arrive in Ireland, you must [ register with immigration ](/en/moving-
country/moving-to-ireland/rights-of-residence-in-ireland/registration-of-non-
eea-nationals-in-ireland/) and get an Irish Residence Permit.

##  UK citizens and health services in Ireland

UK citizens who are resident in Ireland are [ entitled to health services
](/en/health/health-system/entitlement-to-public-health-services/) in the same
way as Irish citizens who are resident. This means that they may access public
health services if they are '  ordinarily resident  '. This is an agreement
between Ireland and the UK, and did not change with the UK's departure from
the European Union.

##  Social welfare payments in Ireland

UK citizens living in Ireland can apply for social welfare payments in the
same way as Irish citizens living in Ireland.

With all [ social welfare payments in Ireland
](http://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/)
, you must satisfy the rules for each scheme to qualify. For example, you must
be habitually resident in Ireland to qualify for most means-tested social
welfare payments.

Residence in the [ Common Travel Area ](/en/government-in-ireland/ireland-and-
the-uk/common-travel-area-between-ireland-and-the-uk/) is treated the same way
as residence in Ireland for the purposes of the [ habitual residence condition
(HRC) ](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/social-assistance-
payments/habitual-residence-condition/) . However, UK citizens who have
recently moved to Ireland may find it more difficult to establish that their
main centre of interest is in Ireland.

If you are currently getting a social welfare payment in Ireland, it will
continue to be paid after the UK leaves the EU, as long as you continue to
fulfil the qualifying criteria for the payment. The Department of Social
Protection has published [ guidance on social welfare payments and Brexit
](https://www.gov.ie/en/organisation-information/96847e-brexit-update-deasp/)
.

If you are receiving a payment from the UK (for example, a British pension)
you will continue to receive it after the UK leaves the EU.

Social contributions (PRSI in Ireland, and National Insurance in the UK) paid
in the UK will continue to be assessed towards Irish pensions and other social
welfare benefits.

##  Can I use my UK driving licence?

You can no longer use your UK driving licence to drive in Ireland unless you
are resident in the UK and are visiting Ireland temporarily. If you live in
Ireland and hold a UK driving licence, you must [ exchange your licence
](/en/travel-and-recreation/motoring/driver-licensing/exchanging-foreign-
driving-permit/) .

##  Can I vote in Ireland?

UK Citizens continue to be [ entitled to vote ](/en/government-in-
ireland/elections-and-referenda/voting/right-to-vote/) in national, and local
elections if you meet the general requirements for voting (for example, you
are over 18 years old). You are not entitled to vote in [ Presidential
elections ](/en/government-in-ireland/elections-and-referenda/types-of-
elections-and-referendums/presidential-election/) , [ European elections
](/en/government-in-ireland/elections-and-referenda/types-of-elections-and-
referendums/european-elections/) or [ referendums ](/en/government-in-
ireland/elections-and-referenda/types-of-elections-and-
referendums/constitutional-referendum-in-ireland/) .

##  Further information and contacts

You can register your email address for updates on Brexit from the [ British
government ](https://www.gov.uk/email-signup/?topic=/world/living-in-ireland)
, and from [ the Irish government ](https://www.dfa.ie/brexit/government-
brexit-update/) .
