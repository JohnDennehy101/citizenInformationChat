  * Workplace Relations Commission 
  * The Labour Court 
  * Compensation payments and tax 
  * How to make a complaint 

##  Your employment rights

If you are working, you have certain rights under employment law such as a [
minimum wage ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/employment/employment-
rights-and-conditions/pay-and-employment/minimum-wage/) and [ annual leave
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/employment/employment-rights-and-
conditions/leave-and-holidays/annual-leave/) . Employment legislation also
bans employers from [ victimising or penalising ](/en/employment/enforcement-
and-redress/victimisation-at-work/) you for trying to enforce your employment
rights.

If you are not getting your rights or entitlements, or if you lose your job
and consider your dismissal unfair, you can make a formal complaint – see 'How
to make a complaint' below. Before making a formal complaint, you should try
to resolve the dispute with your employer directly.

The main organisations that enforce employment rights are the [ Workplace
Relations Commission (WRC)
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/employment/enforcement-and-
redress/workplace-relations-commission/) and the [ Labour Court
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/employment/enforcement-and-
redress/employment-appeals/) .

##  Workplace Relations Commission

The [ Workplace Relations Commission (WRC)
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/employment/enforcement-and-
redress/workplace-relations-commission/) promotes and maintains good workplace
relations. It hears disputes and complaints about employment laws. It helps to
resolve disputes by providing a range of services to employers, employees, and
trade unions.

WRC services include:

  * Inspection of employment rights compliance 
  * Providing information 
  * Mediation 
  * Conciliation 
  * Advisory and adjudication services 

The WRC deals with disputes about equality and discrimination.

##  The Labour Court

The [ Labour Court ](https://www.labourcourt.ie/en/) can investigate
industrial disputes in certain circumstances. It also deals with all workplace
relations appeals. You can appeal to the Labour Court about a decision made by
an adjudicator in the WRC.

##  Compensation payments and tax

If you are awarded a compensation payment because of an employment rights
claim, in certain cases, the payment may be exempt from income tax. The
exemption applies to payments arising out of recommendations or decisions by a
relevant authority following a formal hearing or mediation.

You can read more about this in Revenue’s leaflet [ Exemption from Income Tax
– IT 71(pdf) ](https://www.revenue.ie/en/tax-professionals/tdm/income-tax-
capital-gains-tax-corporation-tax/part-07/07-01-27.pdf) .

##  How to make a complaint

If you have a complaint about your employment rights, you should first speak
to your employer. If you cannot resolve your complaint informally, you can
make a formal complaint to the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC) using its
[ online complaint form
](https://www.workplacerelations.ie/en/Complaints_Disputes/Refer_a_Dispute_Make_a_Complaint/)
.

You must make your complaint **within 6 months** of the alleged incident
(dispute). This time limit can be extended by a further 6 months if there is a
reasonable cause for the delay.

Your complaint should be about one of your employment rights under the
relevant employment law. For example, your annual leave entitlement is set out
under the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997.

Read more about [ how to make a complaint to the WRC
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/employment/enforcement-and-
redress/adjudication-employment-rights-disputes-and-complaints/) , including
which supporting documents you need, and what to expect from [ mediation
](/en/employment/enforcement-and-redress/workplace-mediation/) or the hearing.

You can also read the WRC’s list of [ frequently asked questions about making
a complaint
](https://www.workplacerelations.ie/en/complaints_disputes/making_a_complaint/)
. Contact the Workplace Relations Commission's [ Information and Customer
Service ](https://www.workplacerelations.ie/en/contact_us/contact-details/) .
