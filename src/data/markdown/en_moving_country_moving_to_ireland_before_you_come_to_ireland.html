##  Introduction

Before you come to Ireland, you need to know if you are entitled to live here.
Your right to live in Ireland depends mainly on your nationality and what you
intend to do when you come here.

##  Visas and permission to enter Ireland

There are some general rules which apply regardless of the reason why you are
coming to Ireland.

**UK nationals** : People who are citizens of the United Kingdom (UK) are [
entitled to live in Ireland ](/en/government-in-ireland/ireland-and-the-
uk/residence-rules-UK-citizens/) without any conditions or restrictions.

**EEA and Switzerland:** In general, [ nationals of EEA countries or
Switzerland, ](/en/moving-country/moving-to-ireland/rights-of-residence-in-
ireland/residence-rights-eu-national/) have the right to enter Ireland. You do
not need a visa but you will need a valid passport or identity card in order
to land. You are generally entitled to live in Ireland if you are employed or
self-employed. You can to come here to study or retire here if you meet
certain conditions.

Your family can come to Ireland too, but they may need a [ visa to enter

##  Coming to Ireland to work

You may need an employment permit to work in Ireland, or permission to open a
business, if you are not in one of the categories below:

**UK citizens** can live and work in Ireland without restriction. If you have
family members who are from outside the UK, EEA or Switzerland, they must
apply to join you in Ireland.
