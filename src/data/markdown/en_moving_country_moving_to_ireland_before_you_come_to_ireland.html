##  Introduction

Before you come to Ireland, you need to know if you are entitled to live here.
Your right to live in Ireland depends mainly on your nationality and what you
intend to do when you come here.

##  Visas and permission to enter Ireland

There are some general rules which apply regardless of the reason why you are
coming to Ireland.

**UK nationals** : People who are citizens of the United Kingdom (UK) are [
entitled to live in Ireland ](/en/government-in-ireland/ireland-and-the-
uk/residence-rules-UK-citizens/) without any conditions or restrictions.

**EEA and Switzerland:** In general, [ nationals of EEA countries or
Switzerland, ](/en/moving-country/moving-to-ireland/rights-of-residence-in-
ireland/residence-rights-eu-national/) have the right to enter Ireland. You do
not need a visa but you will need a valid passport or identity card in order
to land. You are generally entitled to live in Ireland if you are employed or
self-employed. You can to come here to study or retire here if you meet
certain conditions.

Your family can come to Ireland too, but they may need a [ visa to enter
Ireland ](/en/moving-country/visas-for-ireland/visa-requirements-for-entering-
ireland/) if they are not EEA or Swiss citizens themselves.

**Other countries:** Citizens of other countries may need to apply for a visa.
If you need a visa or not, you will still need [ permission to enter in
Ireland ](/en/moving-country/visas-for-ireland/permission-to-land-in-ireland/)
and [ permission to remain here ](/en/moving-country/moving-to-ireland/rights-
of-residence-in-ireland/residence-rights-of-non-eea-nationals-in-ireland/) .

##  Coming to Ireland to work

You may need an employment permit to work in Ireland, or permission to open a
business, if you are not in one of the categories below:

**UK citizens** can live and work in Ireland without restriction. If you have
family members who are from outside the UK, EEA or Switzerland, they must
apply to join you in Ireland.

**EEA and Swiss citizens** have the right to work or set up a business in
Ireland **.** You are entitled to be treated in the same way as Irish workers.
You can have [ family members ](/en/moving-country/moving-to-ireland/rights-
of-residence-in-ireland/residence-rights-eu-national/) come with you to
Ireland.

Younger people from certain countries outside the UK, EEA or Switzerland can
apply to come to Ireland on a [ working holiday ](/en/moving-country/working-
in-ireland/employment-permits/working-holiday-visa-in-Ireland/) .

##  Coming to Ireland to study

You may need to apply for a [ student visa ](/en/moving-country/visas-for-
ireland/student-visas/) before you come to Ireland to study. If you donâ€™t need
a visa, you still need [ permission to enter ](/en/moving-country/visas-for-
ireland/permission-to-land-in-ireland/) Ireland. This means you must show that
you satisfy the [ conditions to study in Ireland ](/en/moving-country/moving-
to-ireland/studying-in-ireland/immigration-nonEEA-students/) . Different rules
apply for [ short-term courses ](https://www.irishimmigration.ie/coming-to-
study-in-ireland/what-are-my-study-visa-options/how-to-apply-for-a-short-c-
visit-study-visa/) .

##  General information about living in Ireland

**Returning to Ireland:** Our section on returning to Ireland has information
about what you should know if you are planning on returning to Ireland after
living abroad.

**Retiring in Ireland** : Find out about [ returning to Ireland to retire
](/en/returning-to-ireland/retiring-to-ireland/retiring-to-ireland-as-a-
returning-irish-emigrant/) , or [ moving to Ireland to retire ](/en/moving-
country/moving-to-ireland/coming-to-live-in-ireland/retiring-to-ireland/) .

**Government:** Ireland is a parliamentary democracy. All residents have the [
right to vote ](/en/government-in-ireland/elections-and-
referenda/voting/right-to-vote/) in [ local elections
](/government_in_ireland/elections_and_referenda/local_elections/) and EU
citizens also have the right to vote in [ European elections
](/government_in_ireland/elections_and_referenda/european_elections/) . UK
citizens have the right to vote in [ national elections ](/en/government-in-
ireland/elections-and-referenda/types-of-elections-and-referendums/) as well.
Read further information about the [ national government ](/en/government-in-
ireland/how-government-works/) and [ local government ](/en/government-in-
ireland/how-government-works/local-and-regional-government/functions-of-local-
authorities/) .

**Tax and social insurance contributions:** If you are working or self-
employed you must pay [ PRSI contributions ](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-
welfare-system/social-insurance-prsi/social-insurance/) in the same way as
Irish people. If you are resident in Ireland, you may be liable for [ income
tax ](/en/money-and-tax/tax/income-tax/) and for [ capital taxes. ](/en/money-
and-tax/tax/capital-taxes/) There are specific rules about [ residency for tax
purposes ](/en/money-and-tax/tax/moving-country-and-taxation/tax-residence-
and-domicile-in-ireland/) .

**Education:** Free [ primary education ](/en/education/primary-and-post-
primary-education/going-to-primary-school/) and [ secondary education

school/) is available to all children aged under 18 legally resident in
Ireland. There are also some fee-paying primary and secondary schools
available. School attendance is mandatory until the age 16.

**Equality:** Ireland has equality legislation that prohibits discrimination
in [ employment ](/en/employment/equality-in-work/equality-in-the-workplace/)
and [ access to services ](https://www.ihrec.ie/guides-and-tools/human-rights-
and-equality-in-the-provision-of-good-and-services/what-does-the-law-
say/equal-status-acts/) on a number of grounds including nationality and race.

**Housing:** Some people live in [ owner-occupied private housing
](/en/housing/owning-a-home/) while a number live in [ private rented
accommodation ](/en/housing/renting-a-home/) . [ Social ](/en/housing/local-
authority-and-social-housing/) housing is available, but you generally need to
have been resident in Ireland for a period of time before you become eligible
for it.

**Health services:** If you are ordinarily resident in Ireland, you may be
entitled to a range of [ health services ](/en/moving-country/moving-to-
ireland/introduction-to-the-irish-system/health-care-in-ireland/) that are
either free of charge or subsidised by the Government. There is also a range
of private health care services. Your permission to stay in Ireland may
include a requirement that you have [ private health insurance.
](/en/health/health-system/private-health-insurance/)

**Social security entitlements:** If you are moving to Ireland you need to
know about your social security entitlements. EEA and Swiss nationals come
under the general rules on [ social security for migrant workers ](/en/social-
welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/claiming-a-social-welfare-payment/social-
insurance-contributions-from-abroad/) .

There are [ social security arrangements
](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/dc7910-guidelines-on-application-of-
bilateral-agreements/) with a small number of other countries. These generally
allow contributions in the other countries to be combined with your Irish
contributions to enable you to qualify for benefits.

**Social assistance payments:** Everyone, including Irish citizens, has to
meet the [ habitual residence requirement ](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-
welfare-system/social-assistance-payments/habitual-residence-condition/) if
applying for a social assistance payment. Different rules apply to [ EEA
citizens ](/en/moving-country/working-in-ireland/migrant-workers/eu-citizens-
and-social-welfare/) .

**Pets:** There are regulations about importing pets from abroad, so you need
find out about the [ procedures for bringing your pet to Ireland.
](/en/moving-country/moving-to-ireland/coming-to-live-in-ireland/bringing-
pets-to-ireland/)

**Customs:** There are [ customs regulations about the importation of
prohibited or restricted goods ](/en/travel-and-recreation/travel-to-
ireland/customs-regulations-for-travellers/) and [ Customs and Excise officers
have the power to carry out searches of the baggage of people travelling to
Ireland ](/en/travel-and-recreation/travel-to-ireland/examination-of-
travellers-baggage-by-customs-and-excise-officers/) .

**Driving, cars and transport:** Full driving licences from all other EU
member states (and some other countries) are recognised for use in Ireland.
You should find out if you need to [ convert your driving licence to an Irish
one ](/en/travel-and-recreation/motoring/driver-licensing/exchanging-foreign-
driving-permit/) . If you want to bring your car to Ireland you need to know
about [ importing a car ](/en/moving-country/moving-to-ireland/coming-to-live-
in-ireland/importing-car-into-ireland/) and implications for Vehicle
Registration Tax (VRT).
