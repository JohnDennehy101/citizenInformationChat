##  Introduction

The Commercial Vehicle Roadworthiness Test (CVRT) is a legally required test
for all commercial vehicles in Ireland.

It aims to:

  * Ensure vehicle safety 
  * Contribute to road safety 
  * Confirm that vehicles meet basic safety standards 

It is separate from the [ National Car Testing Service (NCT)
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/travel-and-recreation/vehicle-
standards/national-car-test/) network which only tests cars.

All commercial vehicles must be tested when they are over one year old and
every year after that.​

If you own a [ motor caravan ](https://www.cvrt.ie/en-US/Test-Bookings/Motor-
Caravans/) , you need a CVRT even if you do not use it commercially. You need
to do this 4 years after it was first registered.

When you pass your test, will you get a [ Certificate of Road Worthiness
(CRW)​ ](https://www.cvrt.ie/en-US/Certificate-of-Roadworthiness/) .

The Road Safety Authority (RSA) is responsible for authorising, supervising,
and managing commercial vehicle test centres and testers.

This page has information on how to apply for a CVRT, preparing for the test
and understanding your results.

##  How to book a CVRT test

You can [ book a test online ](https://www.cvrt.ie/en-US/Test-Bookings/) or [
contact a CVR testing centre directly ](https://www.cvrt.ie/en-US/Find-a-test-
centre/) to book a test.

**Note:** The person bringing the vehicle for its test must have
identification with them. A valid driving licence, passport, or a Public
Services Card is accepted.

The online booking process depends on your vehicle type.

**Light Commercial Vehicles**

You will need the following:

  * The vehicle registration number 
  * A valid email address 
  * A time to do the test (check your diary) 
  * Credit or debit card details if you decide to pay online (alternatively you can pay at the test centre) 

**Heavy Commercial Vehicles**

You will need to first register online at the [ CVRT Operator Portal
](https://operator.cvrt.ie/) . Then, log in to the CVRT Operator Portal using
your username and password that you will have set during registration or the
last 4 digits of your VIN (chassis number). Once you log in, you’ll see when
your vehicles are due to be tested.

Choose ‘Book a test’ and you’ll be able to book your test in a few easy steps:

  * Confirm your vehicle(s) details 
  * Choose a test centre and schedule your test(s) 
  * Make a payment (if the test centre is set up to do so) or you can choose to pay at the test centre 
  * They will contact you to confirm they received a booking request 
  * Your test centre will then contact you to confirm your test 

##  Format of the test

The CVRT examines visible and accessible components of commercial vehicles,
such as the:

  * Brakes 
  * Lights and markings 
  * Wheels and tyres 
  * Steering and suspension 
  * Chassis and underbody 
  * Tachograph 
  * Speed limiter 
  * Exhaust emissions 
  * Electrical systems 
  * Glass and mirrors 

More information on the CVRT test items is available in the [ testers manuals
](https://www.cvrt.ie/en-US/About-CVRT/New-CVR-Testing-Manuals/) .

There are 2 types of tests, one for Light Commercial Vehicles and one for
Heavy Commercial Vehicles.

**Light Commercial Vehicles**

  * All small goods vehicles with a gross vehicle weight (GVW) of 3,500 kg or less. 

**Heavy Commercial Vehicles:**

  * All other commercial vehicles 
  * Goods vehicles over 3,500 kg GVW 
  * Goods trailers over 3,500 kg GVW 
  * Buses with more than 8 passenger seats 
  * Ambulances 

##  Preparing for the CVRT

To prepare for the CVRT, ensure the vehicle is in a reasonably clean state
(especially the under body) and accessible for inspection.

You should check your vehicle for the following:

  * Engine has oil and water 
  * Engine is in a fit state to be tested, for example, the timing belt or chain has been replaced in line with your manufacturer`s guidance. You may be asked to sign a disclaimer at your chosen test centre 
  * Windscreen washer has water 
  * Wheel hubcaps are removed (where it is not physically possible to otherwise check the wheel nuts) and the tyres are inflated to the correct pressure 
  * Safety belts are visible and working correctly 
  * Registration plates are clean and comply with current regulations 
  * Temperature gauge is showing as normal before arriving at the test centre 

##  CVRT results

After the CVRT, you will get one of the following [ test results
](https://www.cvrt.ie/en-US/About-CVRT/What-is-the-CVRT/CVR-Test-Results/) :

  1. A pass statement 
  2. A failed test report (needs repairs and a retest within 21 days and having travelled less than 4,000kms), or 
  3. A pass with minor deficiencies (pending check) 

##  Cost of CVRT

The [ CVRT fee ](https://www.cvrt.ie/en-US/About-CVRT/CVR-Test-Fees/) depends
on the size of your vehicle.

**Re-tests**

A visual re-test is free, but a re-test that requires a test lane has a fee.

All re-tests must be completed within **21 calendar days** and within 4,000
kms of the initial test or you must repeat the full test.

**Pass pending recheck of minor deficiencies**

There is no fee for a recheck if the test result for your vehicle is a pass
pending recheck of minor deficiencies. There is also no 21-day and 4,000 km
rule for completing the recheck. However, you will not get a CRW until the
testing centre has confirmed that the minor deficiencies have been fixed.

##  Lost CRW Certificate

You can [ apply online ](https://www.cvrt.ie/en-US/Certificate-of-
Roadworthiness/Lost-or-stolen-CRW/) for a replacement if your certificate is
lost or stolen.

](https://www.cvrt.ie/en-US/About-CVRT/The-legislation/) . You can get
information about getting [ an EU roadworthiness certificate
](https://www.cvrt.ie/en-US/Certificate-of-Roadworthiness/Recognition-of-EU-
