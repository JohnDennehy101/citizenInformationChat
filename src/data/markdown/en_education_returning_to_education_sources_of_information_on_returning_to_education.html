##  Adult learners returning to education

You may have left school early, be unemployed, or want to reskill for a new
job.

No matter your reason for wanting to return to education, there are many
options available to you and a range of supports.

You can return to education with a [ full-time course
](https://www.fetchcourses.ie/courses/fulltime) or a [ part-time course
](https://www.fetchcourses.ie/courses/parttime) .

This page provides information about returning to education and the
organisations providing support. You can find out more about [ further
education and training courses ](/en/education/further-education-and-
training/training-courses/) .

##  Courses with low or no entry requirements

You don't need to have a Junior Certificate or Leaving Certificate to take
part in many [ full-time courses
](https://www.fetchcourses.ie/courses/fulltime) or [ part-time courses
](https://www.fetchcourses.ie/courses/parttime) .

There are [ adult literacy
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/education/returning-to-
education/adult-literacy/) supports to help with reading, writing and maths.
There are opportunities to study for [ the Leaving Certificate
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/education/primary-and-post-primary-
education/going-to-post-primary-school/senior-cycle/) or other certificates.

Initiative (BTEI) ](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/f4113d-operational-

(ETBs) ](http://www.etbi.ie/etbs/directory-of-etbs/) , schools, colleges and
universities throughout the country. The courses on offer vary from centre to
centre, so you should look around if you have interests you'd like to pursue.

Some courses are only open to you if you have completed your second-level
education ( [ post-primary school
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/education/primary-and-post-primary-
education/going-to-post-primary-school/) ). However, you should check the with

##  Can I get a qualification with adult education?

Yes, you can get a qualification with many adult education courses.

Getting a qualification is not always a goal for learners, but you can get
advice from your local ETB.

do/the-qualifications-system/national-framework-of-qualifications) outlines
the levels of qualifications across the Irish education and training system.

course or evening class) to further education, and then to higher education.
