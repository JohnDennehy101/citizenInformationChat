#  Disability payments and work

  * Introduction 
  * Employment and disability payments 
  * FET training courses 

##  Introduction

If you are getting certain disability payments you may be allowed to work or
attend training and keep your payment. People getting Illness Benefit and
Invalidity Pension cannot work (except for unpaid voluntary work). They must
transfer to the [ Partial Capacity Benefit ](/en/social-welfare/disability-
and-illness/partial-capacity-benefit/) scheme if they wish to work.

If you are getting a means-tested payment, your income from work will be
assessed in the means test. However, some of your income from work is not
assessed.

The Department of Social Protection (DSP) has produced a [ Benefit of Work
Estimator ](https://www.mywelfare.ie/BenefitOfWorkDAestimator) tool on
welfare.ie for people getting Disability Allowance, Blind Pension, Invalidity
Pension or Illness Benefit. This can help you to assess the financial
consequences of taking up work or claiming Partial Capacity Benefit.

##  Employment and disability payments

**Social assistance (means-tested) payments** : [ Disability Allowance
](/en/social-welfare/disability-and-illness/disability-allowance/) and [ Blind
Pension ](/en/social-welfare/disability-and-illness/blind-persons-pension/)
are means-tested disability payments. If you start work, you must notify the
DSP and provide proof of your earnings (a pay slip, your contract of
employment or a letter from your employer). You do not need to have been
getting your payment for a minimum period of time before you can take up work.
You may keep your Disability Allowance or Blind Pension if your income is
below a certain level.

If you leave your new job, you should contact the DSP and your Disability
Allowance will be quickly re-instated at the appropriate rate.

###  Income from work

To qualify for a means-tested payment your income from various sources is
examined to see whether it is under a certain level. Some earnings from work
are not taken into account in the assessment of your means and do not affect
your payment. For Disability Allowance and Blind Pension, earnings of up to
€165 from work (either as an employee or as a self-employed person) are not
taken into account at all in the assessment of means. (The means assessed are
your gross earnings less PRSI, any pension contributions and any union dues.
You cannot deduct income tax or income levies.)

If you earn more than €165 per week from work, half of your earnings between
€165 and €375 are not taken into account in the Disability Allowance and Blind
Pension means test.

**Disability Allowance:** all earnings from work over €375 are assessed as
income and your entitlement to Disability Allowance will be reduced in line
with the [ appropriate reduced rates of payment for Disability Allowance
](https://assets.gov.ie/11117/6beb1ad2f51346f4ad6f27db1c473e59.pdf) . If you
are getting payments for a qualified adult or qualified children your means
from work are deducted from the family rate that applies to you.

**Blind Pension:** all earnings from work over €375 are assessed as income and
your entitlement to Blind Pension will be reduced in line with the [
appropriate reduced rates of payment for Blind Pension.
](https://assets.gov.ie/11117/6beb1ad2f51346f4ad6f27db1c473e59.pdf)

There is no restriction on the number of hours you can work.

**Social insurance payments:** [ Invalidity Pension ](/en/social-
welfare/disability-and-illness/invalidity-pension/) and [ Illness Benefit
](/en/social-welfare/disability-and-illness/illness-benefit/) are social
insurance (PRSI-based) payments. You cannot work while you are getting these
payments (with the exception of [ voluntary unpaid work ](/en/social-
welfare/voluntary-work-and-social-welfare-payments/) ).

If you have been getting Invalidity Pension or Illness Benefit (for at least 6
months) you can apply for [ Partial Capacity Benefit ](/en/social-
welfare/disability-and-illness/partial-capacity-benefit/) , if you have a
reduced capacity to work. The work does not have to be rehabilitative. You may
have to pay [ income tax ](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-
system/claiming-a-social-welfare-payment/taxation-of-social-welfare-payments/)
on your total income. Exemptions for rehabilitative work are no longer
available.

###  Occupational Injuries Benefit Scheme and rehabilitative work

**Injury Benefit** is one of the benefits available under the [ Occupational
Injuries Scheme ](/en/social-welfare/disability-and-illness/occupational-
injuries-benefit-overview/) . If you are getting Injury Benefit you can do
light voluntary work. You can also do part-time work which is part of a
treatment or charitable in character (provided you do not earn more than €50 a
week) without permission. However, if you wish to do other rehabilitative work
or a training course you must get written permission from the DSP (called an
exemption) before starting. Exemptions allowing a person to work are not
normally granted within the first 26 weeks of Injury Benefit.

**Incapacity Supplement** is paid to people who are getting Disablement
Pension and who do not qualify for any other disability payments. You can work
provided you do not earn more than €33 a week on average. However, if you wish
to do other rehabilitative work or a training course you must get written
permission from the DSP before starting. Initial requests for an exemption to
do training courses are automatically granted but subsequent requests are
referred to a DSP medical advisor. If you wish to take part in a Community
Employment Scheme, you cannot retain your Incapacity Supplement but you can
retain your Disablement Benefit.

People getting Disablement Pension (without another payment) can work (full-
or part-time) and do not need permission from the Department.

###  Employment schemes and other payments

People getting Disability Allowance can qualify for the [ Rural Social Scheme
](/en/social-welfare/farming-and-fishing/rural-social-scheme/) (if they are
actively farming or fishing).

People getting Illness Benefit, Invalidity Pension, Disability Allowance, and
Blind Pension can qualify for [ Community Employment
](/en/employment/unemployment-and-redundancy/employment-support-
schemes/community-employment-scheme/) .

People getting Disability Allowance can qualify for the [ TÚS
](/en/employment/unemployment-and-redundancy/employment-support-schemes/tus/)
scheme.

People getting Disability Allowance and Blind Pension can qualify for [
Working Family Payment (WFP) ](/en/social-welfare/families-and-
children/working-family-payment/) if they meet the criteria. People getting
Invalidity Pension and Illness Benefit cannot work and therefore cannot
qualify for WFP. People getting Partial Capacity Benefit do not qualify for
WFP.

###  Extra benefits

If you work while getting Disability Allowance or Blind Pension you can retain
any [ extra benefits ](/en/social-welfare/extra-social-welfare-benefits/extra-
social-welfare-benefits/) you were getting. However, the amount of Rent
Supplement you get may be affected by your increased income.

In general, you can retain any extra benefits you were getting when you take
part in an employment scheme.

You can read about Rent Supplement and how additional income from work or
taking part in an employment scheme may affect it in our document on [ Rent
Supplement and changes to your circumstances ](/en/social-
welfare/supplementary-welfare-schemes/changes-to-rent-supplement/) .

###  Keeping entitlement to Free Travel

Since 6 April 2017, under the [ Make Work Pay
](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/0fb542-make-work-pay-report/) initiative,
if you move from a long-term disability payment (see list below) to a job, you
can keep your entitlement to Free Travel for a period of 5 years, provided you
have registered for a [ Public Services Card ](/en/social-welfare/irish-
social-welfare-system/public-services-card/) .

  * Disability Allowance 
  * Invalidity Pension 
  * Partial Capacity Benefit (from Invalidity Pension) 
  * Disablement Benefit paid along with Incapacity Supplement 
  * Transfer from Disability Allowance or Invalidity Pension to a Community Employment, SOLAS or Back to Work scheme. 

##  FET training courses

If you are getting Disability Allowance or Blind Pension and take up a place
on a [ FET training course ](/en/education/further-education-and-
training/training-allowances/) you receive [ a training allowance
](/en/education/further-education-and-training/training-allowances/) at the
same rate as your social welfare payment. Your social welfare payment is
suspended when you are on the training course. You can return to your social
welfare payment when you leave the training course.

If you were getting Invalidity Pension or Illness Benefit, and take up a place
on a FET training course you will continue to get your full social welfare
payment including any increases you get for your dependents. You do not get a
training allowance or a training bonus. You must always apply for prior
written permission from DSP before you can take up a training course.

You can read more in our document on [ training allowances
](/en/education/further-education-and-training/training-allowances/) .

You retain any [ extra benefits ](/en/social-welfare/extra-social-welfare-
benefits/extra-social-welfare-benefits/) that you had before taking up the
course. You can read about how taking part in a training course may affect
your Rent Supplement in our document on [ Rent Supplement and changes to your
circumstances ](/en/social-welfare/supplementary-welfare-schemes/changes-to-
rent-supplement/) .
