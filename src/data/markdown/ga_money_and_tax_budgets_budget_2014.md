Budget 2014 was announced on 15 October 2013.

The main Budget changes that may affect people living in Ireland are set out
below.

This document sets out changes in the areas of taxation, social welfare,
health, housing, education, employment and other areas. It is an overview and
not a complete statement of the measures announced in Budget 2014.

**This document will be updated throughout the week as more details become
available.**

Some of the changes announced in the Budget come into effect immediately.
Others take effect from the beginning of January 2014 or in mid-2014. Many
others have to be finalised before coming into effect.

Some elements of these measures may change when the legislation required to
bring them into effect is enacted.

For a full list of the Budget changes, please see the Department of Finance
website, [ budget.gov.ie ](http://www.budget.gov.ie) . You can find a summary
of the social welfare changes on the Department of Social Protection's
website, [ welfare.ie ](http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/Budget2014.aspx) .

##  Taxation

###  Income tax

From 1 January 2014, the **One-Parent Family Tax Credit** is to be replaced
with a new Single Person Child Carer Tax Credit. The new credit will be to the
same value but will be available only to the principal carer of the child.

Tax relief on private **health insurance premiums** will be limited to €1,000
for each adult insured and €500 for each child. This change applies to
policies which are renewed or entered into on or after 16 October 2013. A
child for the purposes of this provision includes a student over 18 years and
under 23 years who is in full-time education. Relief will continue to be
granted at 20%.

A **new Home Renovation Incentive scheme** of tax relief will be introduced
for a period of two years. The scheme provides tax relief for home renovation
work.

To encourage **those who wish to start their own business** , an exemption
from income tax up to a maximum of €40,000 per annum will be provided for a
period of two years, to individuals who set up a qualifying, un-incorporated
business, having been unemployed for a period of at least 15 months prior to
establishing the business.

**Top Slicing Relief** , which is a reduction of tax due on lump sum payments
when leaving employment, will no longer be available from 1 January 2014 in
respect of all ex-gratia lump sum payments.

Lump sum payments to claimants under the **Magdalene Laundry Fund** will be
tax exempt.

###  Capital Gains Tax

The relief from Capital Gains Tax (CGT) (in respect of the first 7 years of
ownership) **for properties purchased between 7 December 2011 and 31 December
2013** is being extended by one year to include properties bought to the end
of 2014. Where property purchased in this period is held for seven years the
gains accrued in that period will not attract CGT.

A **new Capital Gains Tax incentive is being introduced to encourage
entrepreneurs** (in particular "serial" entrepreneurs) to invest and re-invest
in assets used in new productive trading activities.

**Capital Gains Tax retirement relief** is being further extended to disposals
of leased land in circumstances where, among other conditions, the land is
leased over the long-term (a minimum lease of 5 years) and the subsequent
disposal is to a person other than a child of the individual disposing of the
farmland. The purpose of the measure is to encourage older farmers who have no
children to whom to transfer their farm to lease out their farmland over the
long term to younger farmers.

###  Excise duties

The excise duty on **a** **packet of 20 cigarettes** is being increased by 10
cents (including VAT) with a pro-rata increase on the other tobacco products,
with effect from midnight on 15 October 2013.

The excise duty on **a pint of beer or cider, and on a standard measure of
spirits** is being increased by 10 cent (including VAT); the duty on **a 75cl
bottle of wine** is being increased by 50 cent (including VAT), with effect
from midnight on 15 October 2013.

###  VAT

The **9% reduced VAT rate** , which was introduced in 2011 as part of the
Government Jobs Initiative for tourism-related services, was due to revert to
13.5% on 31 December 2013. The 9% VAT rate is being retained.

The **annual VAT cash receipts basis threshold** for small to medium
businesses is being increased from €1.25 million to €2 million with effect
from 1 May 2014. This change will assist such businesses in the critical area
of cash-flow and reduce administration.

The **farmer’s flat-rate addition** will be increased from 4.8% to 5% with
effect from 1 January 2014. The flat-rate scheme compensates unregistered
farmers for VAT incurred on their farming inputs.

###  Other duties and taxes

The rate of **Deposit Interest Retention Tax (DIRT)** , together with the
rates of exit tax that apply to life assurance policies and investment funds,
is being increased and will now be 41% whether payments are made annually or
more frequently (previously 33%) or are made less frequently than annually
(previously 36%). The increased rates will apply to payments, including deemed
payments, made on or after 1 January 2014.

The 0.6% **stamp duty levy on pension fund assets** is to increase to 0.75%
for the year 2014. The levy will be reduced to 0.15% for 2015\.

The Government has decided that a specific contribution to the Exchequer is to
be obtained from **the financial sector** for the period 2014 to 2016. The
contribution will be related to the amount of tax paid on deposit interest by
the institution in the calendar year 2011. Full details will be contained in
the Finance Bill.

##  Social Welfare

In 2014 €19.6 billion is to be spent on social protection in 2014. New
spending reductions have been limited to €226 million. The Department of
Social Protection has received an increased capital allocation of €15 million
to roll out Intreo centres fully.

There are **no changes to the rates of primary weekly social welfare payments
and pensions** .

###  Jobseeker’s Allowance and Supplementary Welfare Allowance

From 14 January 2014 people without children getting Jobseeker’s Allowance who
are aged between 18 and 24 years will receive €100 per week. Existing
claimants aged between 18 and 24 on a higher rate will have no change in their
rate. This provision applies to Supplementary Welfare Allowance recipients
from 9 January.

From 14 January 2014 people without children getting Jobseeker’s Allowance
aged 25 years will receive €144 a week. Existing claimants aged 25 on a higher
rate will have no change in their rate. This weekly €144 rate will increase to
€188 when they reach 26 years of age. This provision applies to Supplementary
Welfare Allowance recipients from 9 January.

From 14 January 2014 these reduced rates of Jobseeker’s Allowance will apply
to people aged 25 and under who have exhausted their entitlement to
Jobseeker’s Benefit.

**Jobseeker's Allowance – current rates of payment** Maximum personal rate aged 25 years or over  |  €188  |  Increase for a qualified adult  |  €124.80   
---|---|---|---  
Maximum personal rate aged 22 – 24 years  |  €144  |  Increase for a qualified adult  |  €124.80   
Maximum personal rate aged 18 – 21 years  |  €100  |  Increase for a qualified adult  |  €100   
**Jobseeker's Allowance – from January 2014** Maximum personal rate aged 26 years or over  |  €188  |  Increase for a qualified adult  |  €124.80   
---|---|---|---  
Maximum personal rate aged 25 years  |  €144  |  Increase for a qualified adult  |  €124.80   
Maximum personal rate aged 18 – 24 years  |  €100  |  Increase for a qualified adult  |  €100   
  
Currently, all Jobseeker's Allowance and Supplementary Welfare Allowance
recipients, regardless of age, who have children continue to receive a
personal rate of €188 (JA) or €186 (SWA) per week and an increase for a
qualified adult, if applicable, of €124.80 plus qualified child increases.
There are no changes to those arrangements.

The HSE care provision for people getting JA is also extended to age 24 (from
21). So, for example, a person aged 20 who is in receipt of a JA rate of €188
because they were in the care of the HSE during their 17th year can remain on
this rate up to age 24.

###  Returning to education or training

From 14 January 2014 people aged 25 will get an age-reduced rate of
Jobseeker’s Allowance of €144. If they take part in the Back to Education
Scheme (BTEA) they will get a standard maximum rate of €160 per week.

All new BTEA participants aged under 26 who were getting a reduced age-related
Jobseeker’s Allowance payment, will get a maximum BTEA rate of €160 per week
(any means participants have will be deducted from this rate).

People aged 25 who were getting an age-related reduced rate of Jobseeker’s
Allowance will also get a standard weekly allowance of €160 if they take part
in a FÁS course, the Vocational Training Opportunities Scheme (VTOS) or a
Youthreach course.

###  Maternity Benefit and Adoptive Benefit

From 6 January 2014 the minimum and maximum rates of Maternity Benefit and
Adoptive Benefit will be standardised at €230 per week for new applicants.
This will result in an increase of up to €12.20 for those receiving less than
€230 per week and a reduction of up to €32 per week for all other claimants.
The change will apply to new claimants. Existing claimants will not be
affected.

###  Illness Benefit

From 6 January 2014 no Illness Benefit payment will be made for the first 6
days of illness (up from 3 days). This means that a person will not be
entitled to Illness Benefit for the first 6 days of their claim.

###  Rent and Mortgage Interest Supplements

From January 2014 the minimum contribution towards Rent Supplement and
Mortgage Interest Supplement for couples will be increased by €5 per week,
from €35 to €40. This aligns Rent and Mortgage Interest Supplement
contributions with the local authority rents structure. This change applies to
new and existing recipients.

The minimum contribution for single people, including single people with
children (currently €30), will not change.

The Mortgage Interest Supplement (MIS) scheme will be closed to new entrants
and will be wound down for existing recipients over a 4-year period from 1
January 2014.

###  Child Benefit

There are no new changes to Child Benefit in Budget 2014. Child Benefit will
be standardised at €130 per month for each child from January 2014, as
announced in Budget 2013.

###  Breakfast clubs

Extra Breakfast Clubs will be provided to support school-going children in
disadvantaged areas.

###  Back to School Clothing and Footwear Allowance

The Back to School Clothing and Footwear Allowance is unchanged for all
children under 18. In 2014 it will continue to be paid for those aged 18 years
and over who are in second-level education only, not in third-level education.

###  Household Benefits Package

From January 2014 the Telephone Allowance will be discontinued for existing
and new recipients. The value of the allowance is €9.50 per month per
household. The Free TV Licence and Electricity Allowance or Gas Allowance paid
under the Household Benefits Package will continue to be paid with no changes
to rates. There are no changes to the Free Travel Scheme and the Fuel
Allowance Scheme.

In 2014 the annual payment to RTÉ for the Free TV Licence will reduce by €5
million to €54.17 million. This will not affect recipients who will continue
to get a free TV licence.

###  State Pension Transition

As previously announced the State Pension (Transition) will no longer be paid
from January 2014.

###  Invalidity Pension

The higher weekly Invalidity Pension rate of €230.30 paid when claimants reach
age 65 will be discontinued. The rate payable to people aged 65 (and under)
will be €193.50 per week. It will apply to people claiming Invalidity Pension
who reach their 65th birthday from 2 January 2014. Existing 65 year olds are
unaffected. This measure is being undertaken in line with the abolition of the
State Pension (Transition) from January 2014.

People who are getting Invalidity Pension (existing and new recipients) will
continue to be automatically transferred to State Pension (Contributory) at
age 66 and they will receive a weekly rate of €230.30.

The weekly rate payable to all qualified adults of people claiming Invalidity
Pension will be standardised at €138.10 per week. This measure will apply to
spouses and partners aged 66 or over who reach their 66th birthday from 2
January 2014. Existing spouses and partners aged 66 and over are unaffected.

###  Bereavement Grant

From January 2014 the Bereavement Grant of €850 will be discontinued.

The Funeral Grant under the Occupational Injuries Scheme will continue to be
paid. The six weeks' payment after death (where the deceased person’s payment
continues for 6 weeks to their spouse or partner who is also getting a weekly
welfare payment), the Widowed or Surviving Civil Partner’s Grant of €6,000 and
assistance with funeral costs under Exceptional Needs Payments are unaffected.

###  Miscellaneous savings

In 2014 savings of €2.1 million will be achieved in Exceptional Needs Payments
(under the Supplementary Welfare Allowance Scheme) arising through the
standardisation of payments.

The value of certain social welfare payments will be recovered by the
Department of Social Protection from insurance companies in respect of
compensation awards arising from an accident or injury. Savings of €21 million
will be made from this reform measure.

Additional savings of €30 million will be realised in fraud and control
measures during 2014.

##  Housing, Employment and Business, Education and Training

###  Housing

####  Home Renovation Incentive

A scheme of tax relief for home renovation work is being introduced for a
period of 2 years.

The Home Renovation Incentive (HRI) will provide an income tax credit of up to
€4,050 to homeowners who carry out renovation and improvement works on their
principal private residences in 2014 and 2015. It will be payable over the 2
years following the year in which the work is carried out. The credit will be
calculated at a rate of 13.5% on all qualifying expenditure over €5,000, up to
a maximum of €30,000.

Qualifying works include extensions and renovations to the home, window-
fitting, plumbing, tiling and plastering. Builders must be fully tax-compliant
and all expenditure and relief claims will have to be registered
electronically with the Revenue Commissioners.

####  Investment projects

€30 million is allocated to **recommence the State’s house-building
programme** . This will facilitate up to 500 additional housing units between
a small number of new infill developments and the return of previously
uninhabitable units to the housing stock.

€10 million will be provided for an **unfinished housing estate resolution
initiative** where there is no development bond to carry out essential public
works such as footpaths, drainage and roads.

Investments by NAMA will include the **construction of 4,500 new houses and
apartments in Dublin** .

Part of the €200 million to be invested from the sale of the National Lottery
licence in 2014 will be allocated to the **Better Energy Programme** and for
up to 5,700 **housing adaptation grants for older people and people with a
disability** .

€10 million is allocated to resolve the problems at **Priory Hall** .

A new model of financing social interventions, to be called ' **Social Impact
Investment** ' will aim to use private capital to provide better outcomes for
citizens. The pilot phase is seeking private sector investment partners to
provide long-term homes for over 130 homeless families in the Dublin region. A
total of €45 million is being provided for homeless accommodation.

There will also be a **new insulation scheme for local authority housing** .
It is expected that the €25 million being provided will improve the energy
efficiency of 12,500 local authority homes.

€79 million will be provided for **housing regeneration** .

Up to 150 new leased units will be provided for **people with disabilities who
are leaving institutional care** and 175 new housing units will be provided
for **people with special needs** .

A new remediation scheme will be set up for **homes affected by Pyrite** .

The **Living City Initiative** is being extended to Cork, Galway, Kilkenny and
Dublin. The eligibility criteria will now include all buildings built prior to
1915. The initiative aims to assist the regeneration of retail and commercial
districts and encourage families to live in historic buildings in city
centres. EU state-aid approval will be required.

####  Assistance towards paying for housing

The **minimum contribution towards Rent Supplement** for all couples will
increase by €5 per week from €35 to €40 to align Rent Supplement contributions
with the local authority rents structure. The minimum contribution towards
Mortgage Interest Supplement for all couples will increase by €5 per week from
€35 to €40. The minimum contribution for single people, including single
people with children, will not change.

The **Mortgage Interest Supplement scheme will be discontinued for new
entrants** . For existing recipients, the scheme will be wound down over a
4-year period from January 2014.

The legislative basis for the new **Housing Assistance Payment (HAP)** , which
is to replace Rent Supplement, will be introduced in 2014\. A test phase will
begin in seven local authorities.

####  Housing tax reliefs

**Rent Tax Relief** will be reduced, as in previous years:

**Maximum qualifying amounts for 2014** Single under 55 yrs  |  €800   
---|---  
Single over 55 yrs  |  €1,600   
Married or in a Civil Partnership, Widowed or a Surviving Civil Partner, under 55 years  |  €1,600   
Married or in a Civil Partnership, Widowed or a Surviving Civil Partner, over 55 years  |  €3,200   
  
No new changes were announced to **Mortgage Interest Relief** , which only
applies to mortgages taken out by 31 December 2012.

The previously announced rates and ceilings will apply in 2014 in accordance
with the tables published by Revenue. [

rates.html)

###  Employment and Business

####  Small and medium businesses

A **Start Your Own Business (SYOB)** measure is being introduced to encourage
people who are long-term unemployed to start their own unincorporated
business, by providing a two-year exemption from income tax (up to a maximum
of €40,000 per year) for people who have been unemployed for at least 15
months prior to starting their own business.

**Local Enterprise Offices** will get additional funding of €3.5 million for
investment in supports for start-ups and growing businesses.

**Trading-online voucher scheme** : In 2014 €5 million will be provided to
assist the rollout of a national trading-online voucher scheme, aimed at
getting 2,000 small Irish businesses trading online. Under a pilot scheme
being launched in October 2013, vouchers of up to €2,500 will be provided to
50 small companies to help them develop an online trading presence. The scheme
will be administered by the Dublin City Enterprise Board and will target small
enterprises that employ fewer than 10 people and have a turnover of less than
€2m per annum.

**Credit Review Office** : the threshold for credit applications that can be
reviewed by the Credit Review Office is being increased from €500,000 to €3
million.

The **VAT cash threshold** for small and medium enterprises will increase from
€1.25 million to €2 million with effect from 1 May 2014\.

A new **SME Communications Strategy** will aim to increase awareness of State
supports amongst small and medium enterprises (SMEs) and to ensure that there
is a greater awareness amongst businesses of the Credit Guarantee Scheme,
which will soon be re-launched.

A new **Building Business Capacity** programme, consisting of 2 days dedicated
off-site training and expert mentoring support, will aim to enhance the
business and financial capacity of SMEs in relation to understanding and using
a broader range of financial products, as well as equipping them with tools
needed to make a strong business case when applying for credit. The programme
will be launched on a pilot basis, with 1,000 SMEs expected to take part in
2014.

####  Supports for investment in business

**Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs)** : it has been agreed with the
Department of Justice to propose the inclusion of REITs as an investment
option in the Immigrant Investor Programme.

**Research and Development Tax Credit** : the amount of expenditure eligible
for the R&D Tax Credit on a full volume basis (without reference to the 2003
base year) is being increased from €200,000 to €300,000. The limit on the
amount of R&D expenditure that can be outsourced will increase from10% to 15%.

**Capital Gains Tax** : A new relief from Capital Gains Tax is being
introduced to encourage entrepreneurs who reinvest the proceeds from the
disposal of assets, on which CGT has previously been paid, into a new
investment in productive trading activities. The measure will apply where
someone who has already paid CGT on the disposal of assets invests in a new
business in the period 1 January 2014 to 31 December 2018 and subsequently
disposes of this investment no earlier than three years after the date of
investment. The relief will be a tax credit equal to (i) the lower of the CGT
paid on the previous asset disposal or (ii) 50% of the CGT due on any gain
from the future disposal of the new investment. EU state-aid approval is
required for this measure.

**Employment and Investment Incentive** : The initial 30% relief available for
investments under the Employment and Investment Incentive (EII) is being
removed from the high earners restriction for a period of 3 years. This
restriction limits the amount of tax reliefs that can be claimed by high
income individuals. The EII provides that a maximum of €150,000 can be
invested by an individual per annum. Therefore, by lifting the restriction on
the initial 30% relief, these investors should be encouraged to invest more
funds in the EII and improve the availability of funds to SMEs.

####  Supports for unemployed people

It is estimated that spending on schemes such as Community Employment, Tús and
JobBridge will be €1.08 billion in 2014.

Provision of part-time childcare places for Community Employment participants
under the Childcare Education and Training Support (CETS) scheme is to be
introduced in early 2014.

**EU Youth Guarantee** : As part of the implementation of the EU Youth
Guarantee, which is to be finalised and submitted to the EU by the end of
2013, it is proposed to:

  * Reduce the threshold for JobsPlus eligibility to 6 months or less of unemployment for people aged under 25 
  * Provide for an additional intake of 1,500 young people on to the JobBridge scheme 
  * Ensure that 1,000 places on the Tús scheme are targeted at young people

proportion of the workforce is drawn from the long-term unemployed.

####  Activation measures

and work experience is €1.6 billion. This will provide nearly 300,000 places
