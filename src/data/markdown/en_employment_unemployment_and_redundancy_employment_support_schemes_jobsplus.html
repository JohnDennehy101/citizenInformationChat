##  What is JobsPlus?

[ JobsPlus ](https://www.gov.ie/en/service/eecbb7-jobsplus/) is a financial
incentive to encourage employers to hire people who are unemployed. Employers
use JobsPlus when filling new positions, or re-filling positions that occur
from staff turnover.

Eligible employers, who employ [ jobseekers from the live register
](/en/social-welfare/unemployed-people/signing-on/) on a full-time basis, get
regular grant payments to help balance wage costs.

This is paid monthly, in arrears, over a 2-year period by the Department of
Social Protection (DSP). If the employee is under 30 years of age, the payment
is co-funded by the European Commission.

##  Employers eligible for JobsPlus

JobsPlus is available to employers in the private sector, as well as the
community, not-for-profit and voluntary sectors.

It is not open to public sector employers unless the employer can prove the
position is not being funded by the Government.

Eligible employers must meet the following conditions:

  * Be registered as a PAYE employer with Revenue 
  * Be compliant with Irish tax and employment laws. Employers will be asked to give permission to the DSP to check their status with Revenue by supplying a [ Tax Clearance Certificate access number ](http://www.revenue.ie/en/online/tax-clearance.html) (TCAN), using Revenue’s online service 
  * Offer full-time employment of at least 30 hours per week, over a minimum of 4 days. The eligible employee must be on payroll and subject to PAYE and Class A PRSI 
  * Give details of their workforce as part of the application. Where an employer cannot show an increase in the workforce, they will be asked to give additional information to the DSP to support the application. 

Find more information in the list of [ frequently asked questions for JobsPlus
employers ](http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/JobsPlus-Employers.aspx) .

###  Getting other State support for the same employee

If you are an employer getting JobsPlus, you cannot get financial aid from
other State sources for the costs of the same employee.

When applying for JobsPlus, you must tell DSP if you are getting any other
State funding towards the employment costs of an employee.

If approved for JobsPlus, you must also tell any State bodies from which you
are getting funding (for example, Enterprise Ireland and the Community
Services Programme).

Similarly, you cannot get JobsPlus for any employment positions included under
other State-funded wage supports. This is to prevent double funding.

##  Payment rates

Employers can get 2 levels of payment depending on an employee’s
circumstances. The levels are €7,500 or €10,000 and they depend on the age of
the employee and the length of time they are getting a qualifying payment.

The rates are paid to the employer over 2 years (24 monthly payments) for each
eligible person they recruit and keep in the job.

There is no limit to the number of employees you can hire through JobsPlus.

Payment is made monthly in arrears by Electronic Fund Transfer (EFT). It is
not taxable for income or corporation tax purposes.

###  Grants payable over 2 years

JobsPlus is not available to people on apprenticeships, work experience, or
educational or training schemes. This is because they are not considered to be
‘newly created full-time jobs’.

##  Qualifying period for JobsPlus

**Time spent on PUP** counts towards the JobsPlus qualification period.

**Time spent on some education, training, work placement and activation
support schemes** count towards the qualifying period (for example, the
Jobseekers Allowance, Back to Education Allowance, and the [ CE scheme)
](/en/employment/unemployment-and-redundancy/employment-support-
schemes/community-employment-scheme/) . You can [ check which payments and
schemes count towards the qualifying period for JobsPlus
](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/8529b5-operational-guidelines-
jobsplus/#jobseeker-eligibility) .

**Time spent in prison** may also count towards the required qualifying
period.

Jobseekers’ payments paid **during periods of casual employment** may count
towards satisfying the qualifying period, as will **breaks in jobseeker's
payments as a result of periods of illness** , during which Illness Benefit is
paid.

The employee may need to re-establish their entitlement to one of the
qualifying payments above before starting employment.

###  **Coming from Ukraine**

If an employee came to Ireland from Ukraine and spent time on the [
Beneficiaries of Temporary Protection weekly payment
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/moving-country/ukrainian-refugees-in-
ireland/social-welfare-supports-for-ukrainian-refugees/) , before getting a
qualifying payment, this time will count towards the JobsPlus qualification
period.

##  How to employ workers through JobsPlus

If you decide to recruit a new employee, you can [ register as a JobsPlus
employer by completing an online application form
](https://jobsplus.welfare.ie/employer) . You will be asked about the

  * Name of your company 
  * Size of the workforce 
  * bank details 
  * Economic sector of the company 

When you submit your application, the Department of Social Protection (DSP)
will review it and check that your tax clearance certificate is in order. You
will get an email if your application is approved.

You only have to register as a JobsPlus employer once, unless there’s a change
to the company name or employer registration number.

Once your eligibility is confirmed by the DSP, you can start to recruit
candidates. To do this, [ contact your local Intreo Centre or Social Welfare
Branch Office ](https://www.gov.ie/en/directory/category/e1f4b5-intreo-
offices/) for details of suitably experienced and qualified candidates for
your vacancy.

You can also [ register the vacancy with Jobs Ireland
](https://jobsplus.welfare.ie/employer) .

###  When you have shortlisted your candidates

Once you have carried out preliminary interviews and shortlisted the
candidates, you should ask these candidates to [ apply to JobsPlus to confirm
their eligibility for the incentive
](https://jobsplus.welfare.ie/Employee/Create) .

The DSP will process their request and, if they are eligible, post a 2-part
JP1 form to the candidate. Part A of the JP1 form will confirm the employee’s
eligibility and rate of payment for the prospective employer. The candidate
should bring the 2-part JP1 form confirming their eligibility to you for
consideration.

If you choose to employ the candidate, you should complete Part B of the JP1
form, sign the declaration and return it to the DSP.

The JP1 form will be processed by the Department, and once all conditions are
met, you will be told by email that you have been awarded the incentive for
the employee specified on the JP1 form.

Once the candidate has been employed, they should contact the DSP to close
their jobseeker’s claim. This can be done in 2 ways:

  1. [ Online using mywelfare.ie ](https://services.mywelfare.ie/)
  2. By contacting their [ local Intreo Centre or Social Welfare Branch Office ](https://www.gov.ie/en/directory/category/e1f4b5-intreo-offices/) . 

Your payment of JobsPlus only starts when the DSP confirms the employee’s
jobseeker claim is closed. The DSP will not backdate the incentive.

###  **If you make a late application**

Part B of the JP1 form should be sent to the JobsPlus within 30 days after the
candidate starts work.

If you are making a late application, you need to submit evidence of the
reasons for the delay to DSP for consideration.

###  If your application to JobsPlus is refused

If your application to JobsPlus is refused, you can request a review of the
decision. The review will be carried out by a different officer in the DSP
than the person who refused you.

##  Other supports for employees on JobsPlus

###  Working Family Payment

New employees under the JobsPlus scheme may be entitled to get [ Working
Family Payment ](/en/social-welfare/families-and-children/working-family-
payment/) . This is a weekly tax-free payment for employees on low pay with
children.

###  Medical card

People who have been unemployed for at least 12 months can keep their [
medical card ](/en/health/medical-cards-and-gp-visit-cards/medical-card/) for
3 years when they take up new employment.

###  Rent and Mortgage Interest Supplement

You cannot get Rent and Mortgage Interest Supplement if you (the jobseeker) or
your spouse are in full-time employment (30 hours or more a week).

If you are already getting [ Rent Supplement ](/en/social-
welfare/supplementary-welfare-schemes/rent-supplement/) , you may be able to
keep it, if you satisfy a [ means test ](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-
welfare-system/means-test-for-social-welfare-payments/means-test/) , while you
are working full time, as long as you are eligible for housing support under
the [ Rental Accommodation Scheme (RAS) ](/en/housing/local-authority-and-
social-housing/rental-accommodation-scheme/) .
