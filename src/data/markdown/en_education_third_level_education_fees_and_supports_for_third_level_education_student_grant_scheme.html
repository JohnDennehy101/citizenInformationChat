##  What is the Student Grant Scheme?

The Student Grant Scheme is the main financial support scheme for students
studying full-time courses in Ireland and abroad. It is also known as the SUSI
grant because the Student Universal Support Ireland (SUSI) is the awarding
authority for the Student Grant Scheme.

Student grants are divided into:

  * Maintenance grants 
  * Fee grants 

Maintenance grants help students with their living costs. Fee grants pay
tuition fees for students who do not qualify for the [ Free Fees Scheme
](/en/education/third-level-education/fees-and-supports-for-third-level-
education/fees/) . Fee grants can also pay the Student Contribution and the
cost of essential field trips.

If you qualify for the maintenance grant, you also get the fee grant. Some
people only get a fee grant - see ‘How much will I get?’ below.

You cannot get some types of [ social welfare payments and the student grant
](/en/social-welfare/back-to-education/social-welfare-payments-and-the-
student-grant/) .

###  **Part-time fee scheme**

A part-time fee scheme for specified part-time undergraduate courses is
available to eligible students for the 2024-2025 academic year. The scheme
opened for applications on 1 August 2024. Read more about the new [ part-time
fee scheme for undergraduate courses ](/en/education/third-level-
education/fees-and-supports-for-third-level-education/part-time-fee-scheme-
for-undergraduate-courses/) .

###  Postgraduates students

Postgraduates can get information about financial assistance in our page on [
postgraduate student grants ](/en/education/third-level-education/fees-and-
supports-for-third-level-education/postgraduate-student-grant/) .

##  Student Grant applications 2024-2025

Student grant applications for the [ academic year 2024-2025 are open
](https://www.susi.ie/how-to-apply/) .

The closing date for SUSI grant applications is usually sometime in November.
We will update this page when the final closing date for 2024-2025 is
confirmed.

##  Who qualifies for a student grant?

To qualify for a student grant, you must meet all the conditions of the
scheme. These include:

  1. **Nationality condition**
  2. **Residence condition**
  3. **Means test**
  4. **Approved course of study:** you must be attending an approved course of study 
  5. **Progression:** you must be progressing from your previous level of study 
  6. **Maximum period of grant assistance**

We cover each of these conditions below.

###  1\. Nationality condition

To get a student grant you must be a citizen of:

  * Ireland 
  * UK 
  * An EU or EEA country 
  * Switzerland 

If you are not a citizen of one of these countries, you may still qualify for
a grant if you have refugee status, or have an [ immigration status or leave
to remain permission accepted by SUSI ](https://www.susi.ie/eligibility-
criteria/nationality-criteria/) .

###  2\. Residence condition

You must have been resident in the State for 3 of the previous 5 years to
qualify for a maintenance grant. However, if you are temporarily resident
elsewhere in the EU in order to pursue a course of study for a recognised
qualification, and you were resident in the State for 3 of the 5 years before
starting that course, you meet this requirement.

If you fulfil all the criteria for a maintenance grant except for the
residence condition, you may still qualify for a fee grant or a postgraduate
fee contribution as a [ tuition student ](https://www.susi.ie/eligibility-
criteria/residency-criteria/) .

####  Studying in the UK

[ Eligible Irish students studying in the UK
](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/ee9f4-further-and-higher-education-and-
brexit/) , and eligible UK students studying in Irish higher education
institutions, can apply for a student grant.

###  3\. Means test

The means test for a student grant in 2024-2025 is based on your and your
family's gross income for the previous full tax year (2023). However, if you
or your family have had a [ change of circumstances
](https://www.susi.ie/applications-in-progress-next-steps/change-in-
circumstances/index.html) from 1 January 2024, your changed circumstances will
be taken into account. See [ what counts as a change in circumstances
](https://www.susi.ie/applications-in-progress-next-steps/change-in-
circumstances/index.html) on the SUSI website.

SUSI looks at all ’reckonable income’ when assessing your student grant
application. Reckonable income is gross income from all sources. Some social
welfare payments and financial support payments are excluded - see [ more
details on reckonable income on the SUSI website
](https://www.susi.ie/eligibility-criteria/income/index.html) and in the [
Student Grant Scheme 2024 (pdf)
](https://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2024/si/103/made/en/pdf) .

####  If you’re dependent on your parents

If you are **dependent on your parent(s)** , your income (if any) is assessed
together with your parents' income(s). This means you must give details of
your parents’ or legal guardians’ income when filling out your application.
You are dependent on your parents if you:

  * Are under 23 on 1 January of the year you first enter further or higher education 
  * Are over 23 on 1 January of the year you enter or re-enter further or higher education, and you live with your parent(s) or legal guardian 

SUSI makes an allowance of up to €7,925 (previously €6,552) for your earnings
outside of term-time. This is called your ‘holiday earnings’. Outside term
time includes:

  * Christmas holidays 
  * Easter holidays 
  * Summer holidays 

If you get holiday earnings outside these periods, it may also be allowed if
the school or college confirms the exact term-dates in writing.

####  Over 23 and not dependent on your parents

You are considered an ‘independent student’ if you:

  * Are aged 23 or over on 1 January in the year of entry to the course, and 
  * Live independently from October of the year before you first enter or re-enter the course. 

####  Can I be considered ‘independent’, rather than ‘dependent’?

You can only be reclassified from a ‘dependent student’ to an ‘independent
student’ when you:

  * Progress from further education to higher education, or 
  * Have a 3-year break in your studies, or 
  * Are returning as a second-chance student after a 3-year break in your studies. 

####  Income limits for maintenance grant and full fee grant

The family income limits for eligibility for a maintenance grant in 2024-2025
are set out below. These income limits are applied after your means are
assessed (see ‘Means test’ above). The income limits also apply to the grant
(that is, if you don't qualify for the free fees scheme and are eligible for a
fee grant).

**Number of dependent children** |  **Full maintenance (Band 1)** |  **Part maintenance (Band 2)** |  **Part maintenance (Band 3)** |  **Part maintenance (Band 4)**  
---|---|---|---|---  
Less than 4  |  €40,875  |  €41,970  |  €44,380  |  €50,840   
4 to 7  |  €44,810  |  €46,025  |  €48,670  |  €55,768   
8 or more  |  €48,575  |  €49,890  |  €52,760  |  €60,445   
  
####  Income limits for partial fee grant and Student Contribution

The family income limits for eligibility for a partial fee grant in 2024-2025
and Student Contribution in 2024-2025 are set out below:

**Number of dependent children** |  **50% tuition fees and 100% student contribution** |  **50% student contribution only** |  **€500 grant for your student contribution**  
---|---|---|---  
Less than 4  |  €55,924  |  €62,000  |  €100,000   
4 to 7  |  €61,342  |  €68,014  |  €109,600   
8 or more  |  €66,501  |  €73,727  |  €118,806   
  
The 50% tuition fee is not payable if your fees are covered under the [ Free
Fees Scheme ](/en/education/third-level-education/fees-and-supports-for-third-
level-education/fees/) .

####  Other family members in college

The reckonable income limits may be increased for each additional family
member who is doing a full-time course of at least one year’s duration:

  * In full maintenance (Band 1) and partial fee grant categories by €4,950 
  * In part maintenance Bands 2, 3 and 4 categories by €4,785 

If you are an independent student, the family member taken into account is
your spouse, civil partner or cohabitant. If you are dependent on your
parents, the family members taken into account are your parent(s) and their
other dependent children.

###  4\. Approved course of study

You must be attending a course that is approved for a student grant. You can
read a [ list of approved courses ](https://www.susi.ie/eligibility-
criteria/approved-courses/) on SUSI's website.

The [ approved institutions and courses ](https://www.susi.ie/eligibility-
criteria/approved-courses/undergraduate-students-approved-institutions-and-
courses/) are also listed in Schedule 1 and 2 of the [ Student Support
Regulations 2024 (pdf)
](https://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2024/si/104/made/en/pdf) .

###  5\. Progression

In general, you do not get a grant for repeating a year or attending a course
at a level that does not represent progression from your previous studies.
However, you may get a student grant for the following:

  * You attended a further or higher education course and left before it finished. In this case, you may get a portion of a student grant once you have completed the repeat period of study. For example, you did 3 months of a level 7 course and left. You are now starting a new level 7 course. You will not get a student grant for the first 3 months of your new course. 
  * You are repeating a year due to [ exceptional circumstances ](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/e5add-2023-student-grant-scheme-guidelines-for-an-awarding-authority/)
  * You are starting a PLC course as part of the [ Tertiary Education Programme ](/en/education/third-level-education/applying-to-college/tertiary-education-programme/) . The course must be leading to a qualification at a higher level than your previous further education or undergraduate qualification. If you previously started an undergraduate qualification and are not a _second-chance student_ , you may have to complete the repeat period of study before getting a student grant. 
  * You are a _second-chance student_ – see below. 

####  Second-chance student

A ‘second-chance student’ is someone who:

  * Is aged over 23 
  * Did not successfully complete an earlier course 
  * Is returning to do an approved course (at PLC, undergraduate or post-graduate level) after a full break in studies of at least 3 years 

You may do a course during this 3-year break and still qualify as a second-
chance student if the course:

  * Was below undergraduate level 
  * Meets the progression rules 
  * Is not part of the Tertiary Education Programme 

Read more about [ previous education and progression
](https://www.susi.ie/eligibility-criteria/previous-education-and-
progression/) on the SUSI website.

###  6\. Maximum period of grant assistance

You do not qualify for the Student Grant Scheme if you have already got a
grant for the [ maximum number of years allowed
](https://www.susi.ie/eligibility-criteria/previous-education-and-
progression/index.html) for the level of study you are undertaking.

You can use [ SUSI’s Eligibility Indicator ](https://www.susi.ie/eligibility-
reckoner-app-irish/) to see if you may qualify for a student grant in
2024-2025.

##  Student support scheme for asylum seekers

The [ International Protection Student Scheme (for Further and Higher
Education Students) 2024-2025 ](https://www.gov.ie/en/service/e786a-student-
support-scheme-for-asylum-seekers/) provides supports in line with the Student
Grant Scheme to students who are in the international protection system.

The criteria for the Scheme include:

  * You must meet the definition of a protection applicant or a person at leave to remain stage 
  * You must be accepted on an approved Post-Leaving Certificate course or an approved undergraduate course or an approved postgraduate course 
  * You must be part of an application for protection or leave to remain for a combined period of 3 years or more before the start date of the course 
  * You must be resident in the State for a combined period of 3 years or more before the start date of the course 

You do not meet the criteria for the student support scheme if you have been
issued with a deportation order.

The closing date for applications is **28 November 2024** .

####  Renewals

If you successfully applied under last year's scheme and you are still a
protection applicant, you can renew your application. SUSI will email you a
renewal form or you can [ download and complete the application form (pdf)
](https://www.gov.ie/pdf/?file=https://assets.gov.ie/301462/92db2ef9-6aab-4c4c-93fc-7340f0614e47.pdf#page=null)
.

If you got your status during the last year, you no longer qualify for the
International Protection Student Scheme, but you may qualify for the Student
Grant Scheme.

##  How much will I get?

The SUSI grant rate you get depends on the following factors:

####  **1\. Your assessed means**

The means test determines whether you qualify for a full or partial grant. See
‘Means test’ above.

####  2\. The distance you normally live from the college you’re going to
attend

If you normally live 30 kilometres or less from your college, you get the
‘adjacent rate’.

If you live further away than 30 kilometres, you get the ‘non-adjacent rate’.

This is based on the distance of where you ordinarily lived in the year before
you started college.

####  3\. If you’re a disadvantaged student

Disadvantaged students can qualify for a **special rate of maintenance grant**
.

To qualify, you must meet all the normal criteria for the grant and have a
total reckonable income in the tax year January to December 2023 of less than
€26,200 (not including Qualified Child Increases and standard exclusions).

Your parent(s) or guardian(s) must, on 31 December 2023, have been getting a
qualifying social welfare payment or participating in a designated programme.
For example:

  * Getting a long-term social welfare payment 
  * Getting a Working Family Payment 
  * Taking part in a Community Employment (CE) Scheme 
  * Taking part in a Further Education and Training (FET) course or apprenticeship 

You can find a [ full list of qualifying payments and programmes
](https://www.susi.ie/eligibility-criteria/income/special-rate-of-grant/) for
the special rate of maintenance grant on the SUSI website.

###  Rates for the Student Grant Scheme 2024-2025:

**Type of student grant** |  **Non-adjacent rate** |  **Adjacent rate**  
---|---|---  
Special rate  |  €7,586  |  €3,230
