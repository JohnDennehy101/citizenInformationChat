##  Introduction

When you start working for yourself, you are classed as ‘self-employed’ and a
‘sole trader’. A _sole trader_ is when you set up a business on your own.

In general, you are a self-employed sole trader if you:

  * Run your own business and are responsible for its successes and failures 
  * Have several customers 
  * Regularly sell goods or services to make a profit 
  * Are paid for the service you provide 
  * Decide how, when and where you work 

It is relatively easy to become a sole trader (see ‘How to become a sole
trader’ below). However, if your business fails, your personal assets could be
used to pay back your _creditors_ (people or organisation your business owes
money to).

###  **Set up a business without becoming a ‘sole trader’**

If you want to keep your personal assets and business assets separate, you can
set up a ‘limited company’ instead. Read about the [ different types of
business structures ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/employment/types-
of-employment/self-employment/setting-up-a-business-in-ireland#l006ed) ,
including how to set up a business (or ‘partnership’) with other people.

If you are a non-EEA national, you can read about [ coming to set up a
business or invest in Ireland ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/moving-
country/working-in-ireland/migrant-workers/coming-to-set-up-a-business-in-
ireland/) .

##  How to become a sole trader

If you choose to become a sole trader, you are self-employed and you do not
have a business partner. This means you are personally responsible for the
business. So, if the business fails, your personal assets can be used to repay
any loans to your creditors.

To legally become a sole trader, you must [ register as self-employed with
Revenue ](https://www.revenue.ie/en/starting-a-business/registering-for-
tax/how-to-register-for-tax-as-a-sole-trader.aspx) . Once you have registered,
you pay income tax as a self-employed person, rather than through the PAYE
system (which is used for employees).

As a self-employed sole trader, you become eligible for certain tax reliefs.
Read more in ‘Paying tax as a self-employed person’ below.

You do not have to use a business name. But, if you choose to use a business
name, you must [ register your business name with the Companies Registration
Office (CRO) ](https://www.cro.ie/Registration/Business-Name) – read more
below.

##  Registering your business name

If you want to use a business name, you must register the name with the
Companies Registration Office (CRO) **within one month of adopting the
business name** .

You can do this in 2 ways:

  * Download and complete the paper form [ RBN1 (pdf) ](https://www.cro.ie/Portals/0/Business%20Names%20Forms/RBN1%20v2%20fillable.pdf) . There is a €40 fee to register a business name using the paper form. Visit the CRO website for [ information on payment methods ](https://www.cro.ie/en-ie/Publications/Fees/Payment-Methods)
  * [ Register online using CORE ](https://core.cro.ie/registration/sign-up) (Companies Online Registration Environment). There is a €20 fee to register your business name electronically 

You will then get a ‘Certificate of Registration’, which you must display
prominently at your place of business. In general, you will need the
Certificate of Registration to open a business bank account (a business
account lets you keep your business income separate from your personal
income).

You can [ read more about registering your business name
](https://www.cro.ie/Registration/Business-Name) on the CRO website, or [
download the CRO leaflet on registering a business name (pdf)
](https://www.cro.ie/Portals/0/Leaflets/Info%20Leaflet%2014.pdf?ver=UnLXbDu9eFQ1UFHVceCozg%3d%3d)
.

##  Paying tax as a self-employed person

To set up as a sole trader, you must [ register for income tax with Revenue as
a self-employed sole trader ](http://www.revenue.ie/en/starting-a-
business/registering-for-tax/index.aspx) , using the [ Revenue Online Service
](https://www.ros.ie/ros-registration-web/ros-
registration;rjsessionid=165A93E4A38B6C1C16BF3298CBA485DB?execution=e1s1)
(also called ‘ROS’).

###  **If you cannot register online**

If you cannot register online, you can register using the paper [ tax
registration form TR1 (pdf) ](http://www.revenue.ie/en/self-assessment-and-
self-employment/documents/form-tr1.pdf) . You can also use this paper form to
register for VAT.

You will then get a ‘Notice of Registration’ confirming that you are
registered for income tax and, if applicable, for VAT. Find [ more information
about registering for tax as a sole trader
](http://www.revenue.ie/en/starting-a-business/registering-for-tax/how-to-
register-for-tax-as-a-sole-trader.aspx) on the Revenue website.

###  **Once you have registered with Revenue**

When you are registered with Revenue as a self-employed person, you pay income
tax, PRSI and the [ Universal Social Charge
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/money-and-tax/tax/income-
tax/universal-social-charge/) under the self-assessment system.

This means you pay [ preliminary tax ](https://www.revenue.ie/en/self-
assessment-and-self-employment/guide-to-self-assessment/what-is-preliminary-
tax.aspx) (an estimate of your income tax, PRSI and Universal Social Charge
due for the current year) on or before 31 October each year. You will be
charged interest for any late payments.

**Pay and file system**

By 31 October each year you must:

  * Pay your preliminary tax for that year (see explanation above) 
  * File your annual tax return for the previous year 
  * Pay any balance of tax due for the previous year 

Read more about [ paying tax as a self-employed person
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/money-and-tax/tax/income-tax/taxation-
of-self-employed-people#l1f4da) .

###  **Keeping records**

You must keep accounts to record:

  * All purchases and sales of goods and services 
  * All amounts received and all amounts paid out 

You must also keep supporting records, such as invoices, bank and building
society statements, and receipts.

###  **Tax relief (the Earned Income tax credit)**

In 2024, self-employed traders can claim the lower of either:

  * An [ Earned Income Tax Credit of €1,875 ](https://www.revenue.ie/en/personal-tax-credits-reliefs-and-exemptions/income-and-employment/earned-income-credit/index.aspx)
  * A tax credit worth 20% of your qualifying earned income 

However, if you also qualify for the [ PAYE tax credit
](https://www.revenue.ie/en/personal-tax-credits-reliefs-and-
exemptions/income-and-employment/employee-tax-credit/index.aspx) (for example,
if you are an employee of another company, as well as working for yourself),
the combined value of these 2 tax credits cannot be more than €1,875.

###  **Claiming business expenses**

You can claim certain business expenses against tax, as well as your
contributions to your [ personal pension
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/money-and-tax/personal-
finance/pensions/personal-pensions/) .

For example, you can claim for expenses directly linked to your business, such
as:

  * Employees’ wages 
  * Rent bills for the business premises 
  * Accountancy fees 

Read more about [ claiming for business expenses
](https://www.revenue.ie/en/starting-a-business/claiming-a-deduction-for-
expenses/index.aspx#:~:text=If%20you%20spend%20money%20on,deduction%20for%20that%20amount%20only)
on the Revenue website.

###  **Get a refund of previously-paid PAYE income tax**

You may be entitled to a refund of PAYE income tax that you paid over the 6
years before you started a business. This is called the [ Start Up Refunds for
Entrepreneurs (SURE) ](https://www.revenue.ie/en/personal-tax-credits-reliefs-
and-exemptions/investment/relief-investment-corporate-trades/start-up-relief-
for-entrepreneurs.aspx) scheme.

You must [ register for Value Added Tax (VAT)
](http://www.revenue.ie/en/tax/vat/registration/index.html) if your annual
turnover exceeds (or is likely to exceed) the following annual limits:

  * €75,000 for the supply of goods, or 
  * €37,500 for the supply of services 

Read more about the [ SURE scheme and estimate your potential refund
](https://www.gov.ie/en/service/9d489-sure-start-up-refunds-for-
entrepreneurs/) on the Gov.ie website.

###  **If you are a self-employed subcontractor**

If you are a self-employed subcontractor working in construction, forestry or
meat processing, you can get [ detailed information about Relevant Contracts
Tax ](http://www.revenue.ie/en/tax/rct/subcontractor.html) on the Revenue
website. [ https://www.revenue.ie/en/personal-tax-credits-reliefs-and-
exemptions/investment/relief-investment-corporate-trades/start-up-relief-for-
entrepreneurs.aspx ](https://www.revenue.ie/en/personal-tax-credits-reliefs-
and-exemptions/investment/relief-investment-corporate-trades/start-up-relief-
for-entrepreneurs.aspx)

##  Paying PRSI as a self-employed person

If you are self-employed, you pay [ Class S PRSI contributions
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-
system/social-insurance-prsi/class-S-prsi/) . This entitles you to a limited
range of social insurance payments (for example, you are not covered for any
short-term payments, including illness and disability payments).

Class S PRSI contributions are paid at a rate of 4% on all income, or €500,
whichever is the greater. If you earn less than €5,000 from self-employment in
a year, you are exempt from paying Class S PRSI but you may pay €500 as a [
voluntary contributor ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-
welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/social-insurance-prsi/voluntary-prsi-
contributions/) .

When you register with Revenue (see ‘Paying tax as a self-employed person’
above), you are automatically registered for Class S PRSI. You can get
information on PRSI for the self-employed from [ your local Intreo Centre or
Social Welfare Branch Office ](http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/List-of-Social-
Welfare-Local-and-Branch-Offices-by-County.aspx) .

You can also contact the Self-Employment Section of the Department of Social
Protection – see contact details under ‘More information’ below. Or, you can
read the Department’s [ leaflet about PRSI for the Self-Employed (pdf)
](https://assets.gov.ie/38671/0aa2cf3d831a4076b1b6208e1287d9f9.pdf) .

###  **If you employ (or are helped by) family members**

Most employees must pay PRSI. However, if you are a self-employed sole trader,
and you employ or are helped in the running of your business by specified
family member(s), these family members are not covered by the social insurance
system. This is known as _family employment_ .

There are different arrangements for family members working in a 'limited
company', or two or more family members who operate a business as a
'partnership'. Read about the [ different types of business structures
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/employment/types-of-employment/self-
employment/setting-up-a-business-in-ireland#l006ed) .

Read more about [ employing family members and PRSI
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-
system/social-insurance-prsi/social-insurance-in-ireland#l09b20) .

##  Other things to consider

**Insurance**

You are not legally obliged to be insured when you are carrying on a business,
but you are advised to have insurance for various situations. For example, if
the public has access to your business premises, you should have ‘public
liability insurance’.

You may also want to look into [ other types of insurance
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/money-and-tax/personal-
finance/insurance/insurance/) , such as [ health insurance
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/health/health-system/private-health-
insurance/) .

The Irish Insurance Federation has a [ free insurance information service
](http://www.insuranceireland.eu/consumer-information/insurance-information-
service) , where you can get information and advice on all aspects of
insurance.

**Planning permission**

If you are working from home, you may need planning permission.

Planning permission is needed [ if you want to significantly change how you
use your land or buildings
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/housing/planning-permission/planning-
perm-altering-a-house#le5661) . For example, you will need planning permission
if you want to:

  * Convert your garage into a workshop for business use 
  * Open a crèche in your home 
  * Open a bed and breakfast with more than 4 guest bedrooms 

You should [ contact your local authority
](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/942f74-local-authorities/) for advice
about planning permission. You may also want to read our page on [ applying
for planning permission
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/housing/planning-permission/planning-
