#  Deserted Wife's Allowance

  * Introduction 
  * Rules 
  * Rates 
  * How to apply 
  * Where to apply 

##  Introduction

Deserted Wife's Allowance is a means-tested payment made to women under 66
years without dependent children, who were deserted by their husband and who
do not qualify for [ Deserted Wife's Benefit ](/en/social-welfare/families-
and-children/deserted-wife-s-payments/) . Deserted Wife's Allowance has been
closed for new applications since 2 January 1997 when the [ One Parent Family
Payment ](/en/social-welfare/families-and-children/one-parent-family-payment/)
was introduced.

Some women continue to receive Deserted Wife's Allowance because they
qualified for the payment before 2 January 1997 and have continued to meet the
qualifying criteria.

##  Rules

Deserted Wife's Allowance is a payment made to a woman deserted by her husband
and who did not qualify for Deserted Wife's Benefit (because there were
insufficient PRSI contributions recorded on either her own or her husband’s
insurance record before the date of desertion). Deserted Wife's Allowance is
paid until your 66th birthday. You can then apply for a [ State Pension (Non
Contributory) ](/en/social-welfare/older-and-retired-people/state-pension-non-
contributory/) .

The Allowance closed to new applications in January 1997. Some women have
continued to get Deserted Wife’s Allowance because they qualified for the
payment before 2 January 1997 and continue to meet the qualifying criteria
which include:

  * You must not be cohabiting with any person 
  * You have not resumed living with your husband 
  * You must satisfy a means test 

You can find more information about the [ rules for keeping for your Deserted
Wife’s Allowance ](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/cc70a0-operational-
guidelines-deserted-wifes-allowance/) .

You must always tell the DSP if there are any [ changes to your circumstances
](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/claiming-a-social-welfare-
payment/changes-that-can-affect-your-social-welfare-payment/) while you are
getting a Deserted Wife's Allowance. If your means or circumstances change you
may no longer qualify for the payment or it may be reduced. This could mean
that you have to [ repay an overpayment ](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-
welfare-system/claiming-a-social-welfare-payment/social-welfare-overpayments/)
.

##  Rates

Deserted Wife's Allowance maximum rate is €232 per week in 2024.

##  How to apply

It is no longer possible to apply for Deserted Wife's Allowance. The payment
has been closed to new applicants since January 1997.

If you are getting Deserted Wife's Allowance, you may be entitled to [ extra
benefits ](/en/social-welfare/extra-social-welfare-benefits/extra-social-
welfare-benefits/) from the Department of Social Protection (DSP) including
Living Alone Allowance and the Household Benefits Package when you turn 66.
