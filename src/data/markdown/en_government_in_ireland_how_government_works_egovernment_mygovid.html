  * What is MyGovID? 
  * Basic MyGovID account 
  * Verified MyGovID account 
  * How to apply for a basic MyGovID account 
  * How to apply for a verified MyGovID account 

##  What is MyGovID?

To use some online public services, you need to create a MyGovID account.

[ MyGovID ](https://www.mygovid.ie/en-IE/Home/Index) verifies your identity
and provides a single account you can use to access a range of public
services.

There are two types of MyGovID account:

  * Basic account 
  * Verified account 

##  Basic MyGovID account

A basic account is a simple MyGovID account. You just need an email address to
register for a basic account.

You can access some Government services, including:

  * Booking an appointment to get a [ PPS number ](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/personal-public-service-number/)
  * Requesting a record of your PRSI contributions 
  * Checking if you are eligible for dental and optical services under the [ Treatment Benefit Scheme ](/en/social-welfare/disability-and-illness/treatment-benefit-scheme/)
  * Applying for a [ Working Family Payment ](/en/social-welfare/families-and-children/working-family-payment/)
  * Applying for jobs on [ JobsIreland.ie ](https://www.jobsireland.ie/)

##  Verified MyGovID account

A verified account is a more secure type of MyGovID account that lets you
access all services available on MyGovID.

Every time you access your verified MyGovID account, you will be asked to
enter a verification code that is sent to your mobile phone. This 2-step
authentication process makes your account more secure.

With a verified MyGovID you can:

  * Apply for some [ social welfare payments ](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/claiming-a-social-welfare-payment/applying-for-social-welfare-payments-and-services-online/) , get social welfare statements, close your jobseekers claim 
  * Pay your [ Local Property Tax ](/en/money-and-tax/tax/housing-taxes-and-reliefs/paying-local-property-tax/)
  * Access your [ PAYE account ](/en/money-and-tax/tax/income-tax/online-services-for-paye-taxpayers/) with Revenue 
  * Apply for or renew a [ driving licence ](/en/travel-and-recreation/motoring/driver-licensing/full-driving-licence/) or [ learner permit ](/en/travel-and-recreation/motoring/driver-licensing/learner-driving-permits-for-cars-and-work-vehicles/)
  * Book your [ driving test ](/en/travel-and-recreation/motoring/driving-tests/driver-theory-test/)
  * Apply for the [ National Childcare Scheme ](/en/education/pre-school-education-and-childcare/national-childcare-scheme/)
  * Apply for a [ student grant ](/en/education/third-level-education/fees-and-supports-for-third-level-education/student-grant-scheme/)
  * [ Register to vote ](/en/government-in-ireland/elections-and-referenda/voting/registering-to-vote/)
  * Apply for a [ passport ](/en/travel-and-recreation/passports/applying-for-or-renewing-an-irish-passport/)

You can read the [ full list of services available
](https://www.mygovid.ie/en-IE/WhatCanIUseItFor) on the MyGovID website.

##  How to apply for a basic MyGovID account

To create your basic MyGovID account:

  * Visit the [ MyGovID sign-up page ](https://www.mygovid.ie/en-IE/HowDoISignUp)
  * Enter your email address and create a password 
  * Click ‘Register now’ 

A code will be sent to your email address which you will need to enter on
screen to complete your basic account registration.

Once you have activated your MyGovID account, you can log into your basic
account. You will see a list of online services.

##  How to apply for a verified MyGovID account

If you have a basic MyGovID account, you can upgrade it to a verified MyGovID
account.

You can [ apply online for a verified MyGovID account
](https://www.mygovid.ie/en-IE/HowDoISignUp) if you have a:

  * [ Public Services Card (PSC) ](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/public-services-card/) and
