##  What is MyGovID?

To use some online public services, you need to create a MyGovID account.

[ MyGovID ](https://www.mygovid.ie/en-IE/Home/Index) verifies your identity
and provides a single account you can use to access a range of public
services.

There are two types of MyGovID account:

  * Basic account 
  * Verified account 

##  Basic MyGovID account

A basic account is a simple MyGovID account. You just need an email address to
register for a basic account.

You can access some Government services, including:

  * Booking an appointment to get a [ PPS number ](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/personal-public-service-number/)
  * Requesting a record of your PRSI contributions

access all services available on MyGovID.

enter a verification code that is sent to your mobile phone. This 2-step
authentication process makes your account more secure.
