##  What is a Debt Relief Notice?

A Debt Relief Notice (DRN) is one of [ 3 debt resolution arrangements
](/en/money-and-tax/personal-finance/debt/personal-insolvency/personal-
insolvency-options/) for people who cannot afford to pay their personal debts.
These arrangements offer different solutions to people in different
situations.

The Debt Relief Notice is for people who have very low disposable income or
assets. It allows for the write-off of qualifying debt up to €35,000 under a
3-year supervision period.

This page describes how to qualify for a DRN and how the process works.

The Insolvency Service of Ireland has published a [ Guide to a Debt Relief
Notice (pdf) ](https://backontrack.ie/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/DRN_2021.pdf)
and a [ shorter guide to DRN (pdf) ](https://backontrack.ie/wp-
content/uploads/2022/10/ISI_DRN.pdf) . It also provides information on DRNs on
its website [ backontrack.ie ](http://backontrack.ie/drn/) , aimed at people
who are struggling with debt.

You can read a general [ overview of personal insolvency options ](/en/money-
and-tax/personal-finance/debt/personal-insolvency/personal-insolvency-
options/) .

##  Am I eligible?

A Debt Relief Notice deals with qualifying debts of up to €35,000 in the case
of people who have very low disposable income or assets and no prospect of
being able to pay off their debts in the next 3 years.

The [ MABS Helpline ](https://mabs.ie/contact/#phone) provides a free service
to check if you are eligible for a DRN.

You can only get a DRN once.

You cannot get a DRN if you are involved in one of the other [ personal
insolvency options ](/en/money-and-tax/personal-finance/debt/personal-
insolvency/personal-insolvency-arrangements/) , or the [ bankruptcy
](/en/money-and-tax/personal-finance/debt/personal-insolvency/what-is-
bankruptcy/) process, or if you have completed such a process within the last
5 years.

###  Qualifying debts

In general, you will usually only qualify for a DRN if all of your debts are
unsecured and if the total of your debt to all your creditors adds up to
€35,000 or less.

**Unsecured debts**

A Debt Relief Notice mainly covers _unsecured_ debts (though it can include
some secured debts – see below) so it is important to know whether your debts
are secured or not.

In general, debts such as the following are unsecured:

  * Utility bill arrears (gas, electricity etc.) 
  * Rent arrears 
  * Credit card debt 
  * Store card debt 
  * Bank overdrafts 
  * Unsecured bank loans 

However, if they are rolled up into your mortgage, they become secured loans.

**Secured debts**

A _secured_ debt is a loan on which property or goods are available as
security against non-payment. Mortgages and car loans are the most common
secured loans. (If you have this type of debt, you cannot get a DRN but you
may apply for another personal insolvency option.)

**Exceptions**

While a DRN will not cover mortgages or similar large-scale secured debt, in
certain exceptional cases a loan may be secured against a small item of
property, such as a ring. Such a secured debt can be included in a DRN, but
only if the creditor agrees.

###  Excluded and excludable debts

The [ Personal Insolvency Act 2012
](http://revisedacts.lawreform.ie/eli/2012/act/44/revised/en/html) specifies
certain types of debt that **cannot** be written off by a Debt Relief Notice.
These are called _excluded_ debts.

The Act specifies certain other types of debt that are _excludable_ from a
DRN. This means that they can only be covered by the DRN if the creditor is
asked and agrees to let them be included. If they agree, they become
_permitted_ debts – debts that the creditor permits to be covered. Most types
of excludable debts are those owed to the State.

The types of debts that are _excluded_ are those that are due to:

  * Family law orders, such as [ maintenance orders ](/en/birth-family-relationships/separation-and-divorce/maintenance-orders-and-agreements/) for spouses and children 
  * Court awards for personal injury or death 
  * A loan (or forbearance of a loan) obtained through fraud or similar wrongdoing 
  * Court orders made under the Proceeds of Crime Acts 
  * Fines imposed by the courts for criminal offences 

The types of debt that are _excludable_ are:

  * Taxes, duties or levies owed to the State, such as income tax, the [ Local Property Tax ](/en/money-and-tax/tax/housing-taxes-and-reliefs/local-property-tax/) , [ VAT ](/en/money-and-tax/tax/duties-and-vat/value-added-tax/) or capital taxes 
  * Service charges owed to local authorities 
  * Rates 
  * Money owed for a [ Nursing Home Loan under the Fair Deal Scheme ](../../../../health/health_services/health_services_for_older_people/nursing_homes_support_scheme_1.en.html#ld1971)
  * Money owed to the Department of Social Protection 
  * Debts due to [ owners’ management companies ](/en/housing/owning-a-home/home-owners/management-companies-for-apartment-blocks/) in respect of annual service charges or contributions due for multi-unit developments (this is the only non-State debt in this category) 

###  Income and asset tests

All of your income will be taken into account, except for [ Child Benefit
](/en/social-welfare/families-and-children/child-benefit/) . Any assets that
you have will also be valued.

**Income**

You will only qualify for a DRN if, after deducting certain outgoings, you
would be left with a net monthly disposable income of €60 or less after paying
reasonable living expenses. The 2 types of outgoings are:

  * **Payments in respect of debts that are outside the DRN process** – these are either _excluded_ debts that cannot be covered, or _excludable_ debts that the creditor has not agreed to include, as outlined above 
  * **Reasonable living expenses** , which will be assessed in accordance with detailed guidelines – see below 

Your net disposable income takes account of your income from salary, wages,
pensions and contributions from other household members. Any other income
available to you is also taken into account – including all social welfare
payments except Child Benefit.

Deductions are then made for:

  * Income tax, PRSI and other charges/levies on income (such as [ Universal Social Charge ](/en/money-and-tax/tax/income-tax/universal-social-charge/) ) 
  * Payments that you make in respect of excluded debts and excludable debts (unless they are _permitted_ debts that the creditor agrees to include in the DRN 
  * Reasonable living expenses - see below 

**Assets**

The total value of your assets must be €1,500 or less. They are assessed at
market value and include savings, shares and property. The following assets
are not taken into account:

  * Essential household equipment and appliances and books, tools or equipment needed for employment or business, up to a total value of €6,000 
  * Books or equipment that are reasonably necessary to enable you or a dependant to participate in and complete a course of education (at primary or secondary level only) 
  * A vehicle that has been adapted for a person with a disability (either you or one of your dependants) 
  * A motor vehicle up to a value of €5,000 * 
  * One item of personal jewellery to a maximum value of €750 * 
  * Any future pension entitlement or option that you cannot choose to access at present 

* A motor vehicle or piece of jewellery cannot be excluded from the asset test if the cost of buying it forms part of your qualifying debts. 

**Reasonable standard of living and reasonable living expenses**

You must be left with enough income to have a reasonable standard of living
for yourself and your dependants.

The [ Insolvency Service of Ireland (ISI) ](https://www.isi.gov.ie/) is
responsible for drawing up guidelines on what is a reasonable standard of
living and reasonable living expenses. The guidelines provide examples of what
may and may not be allowed as reasonable living expenses. They are reviewed
every year.

You can use the ISI's [ reasonable living expenses calculator
](http://backontrack.ie/RLE-Calculator/) to find out what your household's
monthly expenses would be assessed at.

##  How does a Debt Relief Notice work?

If a DRN is issued for you, it will allow for the write-off of your qualifying
debt up to €35,000, subject to a 3-year supervision period. You will still
have to pay any excluded debts and for any excludable debts that your
creditors have not agreed to include in the DRN - see ‘Excluded and excludable
debts’ above.

During the supervision period, you cannot get credit of €650 or more, either
on your own or as part of a joint application with someone else, without
telling the lender that you have a Debt Relief Notice.

You will have to tell the Insolvency Service of any change in your
circumstances, for example, any increases in income, assets or liabilities. If
your financial position improves above certain limits, you will have to repay
part of your debts – see ‘Paying part of your debts’ below.

You will also have to tell the ISI if you become aware of any errors or
omissions in the documentation included in your application for the DRN. The
ISI has extensive powers of investigation of anything that it considers
relevant to your case.

The Circuit Court may extend the supervision period in certain circumstances –
see ‘Extension or unsuccessful ending of a DRN’ below.

Details of your DRN will be placed on a public Register of Debt Relief
Notices.

###  Effects on your creditors

The issue of the DRN will usually be the first official notification to your
creditors that you have applied to have your debts written off. However,
creditors with excludable debts, will be consulted beforehand about having
their debts included as permitted debts. Your other creditors can object on
certain specified grounds when they receive the DRN – see ‘Objections’ below.

During the supervision period, your creditors will not be allowed to take any
action against you for the recovery of debts covered by the DRN. This means
that your creditors cannot:

  * Start of continue legal action or 
  * Seek to recover payment for a debt or recover goods or 
  * Execute or [ enforce a judgment ](/en/money-and-tax/personal-finance/debt/enforcement-of-debt-judgments/) in respect of a debt 
  * Contact you for payment 

However, if any of your debts were guaranteed by another person, the creditor
can take action against that person.

**Objections**

Any of your creditors may apply to the Circuit Court if they object to the
inclusion of the debts you owe them in the Debt Relief Notice.

They can only object on the following grounds:

  * You are not eligible for a DRN 
  * You provided inaccurate information 
  * You have failed to inform the Insolvency Service of changed circumstances or failed to surrender extra income as required 
  * You are an undischarged bankrupt 
  * You have committed an offence under the Personal Insolvency legislation since the DRN came into effect 
  * The procedural requirements were not followed 
  * In the 6 months before applying for the DRN, you had arranged your financial affairs so that you could get a DRN 

The Court has the power to make various decisions, including extending or
ending the DRN. The ISI may apply to the Court for withdrawal of the notice on
similar grounds and with similar consequences – see ‘Extension or unsuccessful
ending of a DRN’ below.

###  Paying part of your debts

If your income increases, or you get gifts, above a certain amount during the
3-year supervision period, you will have to give half to repay your debts.

  * If your net income increases by €400 or more per month, you must give half of that increase to the ISI 
  * If you get a gift or payment worth €500 or more, you must give half of it to the ISI 

Your income increase is taken as whichever is the higher figure after
comparing your new income to:

  * Your income at the time of your application 
  * Your reasonable living expenses at the time of your application 

Income is calculated after tax, social insurance payments, levies, and
payments made to any debts excluded from the DRN.

Any amounts you give to the Insolvency Service will be distributed to the
relevant creditors in proportion to the size of the debts that you owe to each
creditor.

If you pay 50% or more of the total debts covered by the Debt Relief Notice,
you can exit the process before the end of the 3-year supervision period.

###  Debt Relief Certificate

At the end of the supervision period (or if you have managed to pay 50% or
more of your debts) the Debt Relief Notice will cease to have effect. You will
be discharged from the debts it covered and any interest or penalties on those
debts. All of the information about your DRN will be removed from the public
Register of Debt Relief Notices and you will be given a Debt Relief
Certificate, confirming that you have been discharged from the relevant debts.
The ISI will also write to all the creditors concerned, to tell them that the
Debt Relief Notice has been removed from the Register.

###  Extension or unsuccessful ending of a DRN

In certain circumstances, the Debt Relief Notice may be amended or terminated,
enforcement orders may be issued, or the supervision period may be extended.
The main situations in which this can happen are:

  * If you have failed to disclose an improvement in your financial position during the supervision period, the Circuit Court can make an order for enforcement, extend the period of the DRN, amend the DRN or make other orders or directions. 
  * If you or one of your creditors are aggrieved by something the Insolvency Service has done (or not done) and apply to the Circuit Court, the court may decide to revoke a decision of the ISI or make an order as above. 
  * If it turns out that you have given incomplete or false information, were not originally eligible for a DRN, have failed to surrender money to the ISI or are otherwise in breach of your DRN obligations, the court can make orders as above or can decide to terminate the DRN. 
  * In the 6 months before applying for the DRN, you had arranged your financial affairs so that you could get a DRN 

If your Debt Relief Notice is terminated by the Court, you will be liable to
pay all the unpaid debts that it had covered (unless the Court orders
otherwise) along with any arrears, charges and interest that built up during
the supervision period.

###  **European Union (EU) recognition**

The DSA is an insolvency proceeding that is recognised in other EU states
under EU law. This means that you may get the same protection against
creditors in most other EU countries as you get in Ireland, subject to [ EU
law ](https://commission.europa.eu/strategy-and-policy/policies/justice-and-
fundamental-rights/civil-justice/civil-and-commercial-law/insolvency-
proceedings_en#insolvency-and-the-internal-market) .

##  How do I get a Debt Relief Notice?

You must apply through an Approved Intermediary (AI) – see [ How to apply
](debt_relief_notices.en.html#ld1a9a) below.

You must disclose all details of your financial affairs to the AI, who will
then advise you whether or not you meet the conditions for a DRN, the
consequences, and any alternative options.

If you decide go ahead and apply for a DRN, you must confirm your intention in
writing.

###  Providing information

You must complete a Prescribed Financial Statement (PFS), giving full and
honest information about your financial circumstances. You must act in good
faith and co-operate fully with the process.

You must allow access to certain personal data held by banks and other
financial institutions so that your financial situation can be verified.
Government departments and agencies will have the power to release certain
information about you.

The AI will help you to complete the Prescribed Financial Statement and will
then process your application if:

  * You meet the eligibility conditions 
  * The information in your PFS is complete and accurate in all material respects - you must confirm this by making a statutory declaration 

A statutory declaration is a solemn statement which must be signed in the
presence of someone who is authorised to witness statutory declarations – such
as a practising solicitor, a Peace Commissioner, a notary public or a
Commissioner for Oaths.

###  Fees

The ISI has waived its fees for Debt Relief Notices until 31 December 2026.

###  Next steps

When the AI is satisfied that you are eligible for a Debt Relief Notice and
that all the information you have provided is complete and accurate, they will
sign a statement saying so. The AI will then send your application, including
all the details of your financial affairs and your debts, to the Insolvency
Service to have a DRN approved.

When considering your application, the Insolvency Service can ask the AI for
further information and can enquire into anything it considers relevant to
verify the completeness and accuracy of your application. It can request
information about your bank accounts, assets, liabilities, employment and
income, and the law states that anyone asked for such information (your bank,
employer etc.) “shall furnish the information requested as soon as
practicable”.

Government departments, the Revenue Commissioners and other State bodies can
also provide relevant information to the ISI about your financial
circumstances.

The ISI will issue a certificate that your application is in order and notify
the Circuit Court. The court will review the application and documentation
and, if satisfied that the conditions are met, will issue a Debt Relief
Notice.

The Court will notify the Insolvency Service, the AI, yourself and the
relevant creditor(s) of the DRN. The DRN will relate to specific debts and
specific creditors. You may well have other debts that are not covered by the
DRN and those creditors are not affected by it. The Insolvency Service will
publish details of the DRN on the Register of Debt Relief Notices, which is
accessible to the public.

##  How to apply

Your application for a Debt Relief Notice must be made through an Approved
Intermediary (AI). You can choose an AI from the [ Register of Approved
