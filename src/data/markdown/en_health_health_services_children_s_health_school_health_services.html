##  Introduction

The [ Health Service Executive ](/en/health/health-system/health-service-
executive/) (HSE) provides a school screening programme to check childrenâ€™s
health, including their:

  * Hearing 
  * Eyesight 

The screening is provided in public primary schools but private primary
schools may also request the service.

The HSE also provides a [ school immunisation programme ](/en/health/health-
services/children-s-health/vaccinations-for-children/) .

##  How do school health screenings work?

School health screenings are conducted by [ public health nurses
](/en/health/health-services/care-in-your-community/public-health-nurses/) and
area medical officers who are employed by the HSE.

The screenings take place in the school and the principal is told in advance
so that parents can be notified. You will be asked to sign a consent form
before the health check.

Your child's hearing and vision are tested and a physical examination may be
carried out.

##  Cost for school health screening

If the school health screening identifies a health issue, the child can get
free treatment as a public patient in the out-patient department of a
hospital.

Any follow-on treatment your child needs as a public patient is free of
charge.

##  Further information

School screening is arranged by the HSE with the school principal.
