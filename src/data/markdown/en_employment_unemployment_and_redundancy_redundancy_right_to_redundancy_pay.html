##  What is statutory redundancy pay?

Where you lose your job because your employer is closing the business or
reducing staff numbers, this is known as [ redundancy
](/en/employment/unemployment-and-redundancy/redundancy/what-is-redundancy/) .

You are entitled to get a minimum redundancy payment after you have two years’
service in your job. This is known as a _statutory redundancy_ . The statutory
redundancy payment is based on a calculation using your pay and your length of
service.

##  Do I have a right to redundancy pay?

To be eligible for a statutory redundancy payment, you must:

  * Be over 16 
  * Be in [ employment that is fully insurable ](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/social-insurance-prsi/social-insurance/) under the Social Welfare Acts 
  * Have at least 2 years’ continuous employment (104 weeks) with the same employer over the age of 16 
  * Have been made redundant (dismissed from your job). 

###  You must have been dismissed from your job

To show you were dismissed, your employment must have been terminated (with or
without notice).

There will also be a dismissal if you have ended your contract of employment
because you were forced to leave your job because of your employer’s conduct.
This is known as [ constructive dismissal ](/en/employment/unemployment-and-
redundancy/dismissal/constructive-dismissal/) .

##  What is continuous employment?

To qualify for a statutory redundancy payment you must have 2 years’ (104
weeks) _continuous employment_ in your job.

Continuous employment is the length of time you are employed by the business.
The following situations will not break your continuous employment:

  * You were on [ maternity leave ](/en/employment/employment-rights-and-conditions/leave-and-holidays/maternity-leave/) , [ paternity leave ](/en/employment/employment-rights-and-conditions/leave-and-holidays/paternity-leave/) , [ adoptive leave ](/en/employment/employment-rights-and-conditions/leave-and-holidays/adoptive-leave/) , [ parental leave ](/en/employment/employment-rights-and-conditions/leave-and-holidays/parental-leave/) , [ parent's leave ](/en/employment/employment-rights-and-conditions/leave-and-holidays/parents-leave/) or [ carer's leave ](/en/employment/employment-rights-and-conditions/leave-and-holidays/carers-leave/)
  * You were off work through illness, agreed absence, holidays or lay off 
  * You were dismissed due to redundancy before reaching 104 weeks' service and then taken back by your employer within 26 weeks of that dismissal 
  * You have been re-employed within 4 weeks of dismissal by an associate company of your previous employer 
  * You have been voluntarily transferred to another employer and it is agreed that the continuity of your service will not be broken 
  * You are placed back in your employment under the [ unfair dismissals legislation ](/en/employment/unemployment-and-redundancy/dismissal/unfair-dismissal/)
  * You are on strike or locked out of your employment 
  * There has been a [ transfer of the business you work for to a new owner ](/en/employment/employment-rights-and-conditions/contracts-of-employment/transfer-of-business/)

###  Is continuous employment and reckonable service the same?

No, continuous employment is the length of time you have been employed in your
job that counts towards qualifying for redundancy. You need 104 weeks of
continuous employment to qualify for redundancy.

The amount of redundancy pay you get is based on your reckonable service with
your employer. Some types of absences do not count towards [ reckonable
service ](/en/employment/unemployment-and-redundancy/redundancy/redundancy-
payments#lf6d25) .

##  If you work part-time

By law, [ part-time workers ](/en/employment/types-of-employment/rights-of-
part-time-workers/) cannot have less favourable conditions of employment than
comparable full-time workers.

This means that part-time workers (including casual workers) have a right to
statutory redundancy. You must still meet the requirement for 2 years'
continuous service described above.

##  If you are an agency worker

As an [ agency worker ](/en/employment/types-of-employment/agency-workers/) ,
you are also protected under redundancy legislation.

If the employment agency pays your wages, it is responsible for paying the
statutory redundancy payment.

##  If you are an apprentice

If you are an apprentice and are made redundant during the apprenticeship, you
may qualify for a redundancy payment. You must meet the conditions of having 2
years' service (104 weeks) over the age of 16.

If you are dismissed within one month of the end of the apprenticeship, you
will not qualify for a redundancy payment.

If you are kept on as an employee for more than a month after the
apprenticeship ended and are subsequently made redundant, the time spent as an
apprentice aged over 16 will count in the redundancy payment calculation.

##  If you are on a fixed-term contract

If you are on a [ fixed-term contract ](/en/employment/employment-rights-and-
conditions/contracts-of-employment/rights-of-fixed-term-workers/) you may be
entitled to statutory redundancy if your employer does not renew your fixed-
term contract under the same or a similar contract before the term expires.

You must still meet the requirement for 2 years' continuous service described
above. A series of shorter contracts that followed on from each other and
added up to 2 years can also meet the 2 years’ continuous service requirement.

##  If you are a seasonal worker

If you are a seasonal worker and have at least 2 years’ service with your
employer you may qualify for redundancy.

The 2 years does not include the time you are off work. The question of
redundancy does not arise until the usual time when your seasonal work would
start. If you are not re-employed then, you may be entitled to a redundancy
payment.

##  If you are a director

If you are a director, you may be entitled to a redundancy payment if you have
the right tax contributions.

You must qualify for a redundancy payment under existing rules – see ‘Do I
have a right to redundancy pay?’ above.

##  If you are over 66

In the past, you had to be between 16 and 66 to qualify for statutory
redundancy pay. The upper age limit of 66 was removed by the Protection of
Employment Act 2007.

Employees who are over 16 and in employment which is insurable for all
benefits under the Social Welfare Acts are entitled to statutory redundancy
pay. This includes employees who are over 66 and who would be insurable, **but
for their age** .

The time spent in employment aged over 66 will count in the redundancy payment
calculation.
