#  Working from home and tax relief

  * Introduction 
  * Can I get Remote Working Relief? 
  * What expenses can I claim? 
  * How much can I claim? 
  * How to calculate the amount you can get tax relief on 
  * How to apply 

##  Introduction

Working from home is also known as remote working or e-working.

If you work from home for substantial periods, either full-time or part-time,
you may be able to claim tax relief on the extra costs, including:

  * Electricity 
  * Heating 
  * Broadband 

The cost of items you buy, such as office equipment, is not eligible for
Remote Working Relief.

You can [ apply for the tax relief ](eworking_and_tax_relief.en.html#ld1a9a)
after the end of the tax year or during the year. If you claim during the
year, you can get real-time credits and have your tax reduced during the year.

If you use only part of your home for e-working, it does not affect [
exemption from Capital Gains Tax
](../capital_taxes/capital_gains_tax.en.html#l728f0) if you sell it as your
principal private residence.

##  Can I get Remote Working Relief?

To qualify, you must:

  * Have an arrangement with your employer to work from home 
  * Be required to perform substantive duties at home 
  * Be required to work for substantial periods at home 

Remote working involves:

  * Working for substantial periods at home 
  * Logging onto a work computer system remotely 
  * Sending and receiving email, data or files remotely 
  * Developing ideas, products and services remotely 

You are not entitled to claim tax relief if you bring work home from the
office outside of normal working hours, for example in the evenings or at
weekends.

More information on the eligibility criteria is available in [ Revenue’s Tax
and Duty Manual on e-Working and Tax (pdf) ](https://www.revenue.ie/en/tax-
professionals/tdm/income-tax-capital-gains-tax-corporation-
tax/part-05/05-02-13.pdf) .

##  What expenses can I claim?

Tax relief on e-working covers the additional costs of working from home. This
includes:

  * Electricity 
  * Heating 
  * Broadband 

Items you buy, such as laptops, computers, office equipment and office
furniture, are not allowable costs for Remote Working Relief.

**Should I pay tax on equipment from my employer?**

If your employer gives you equipment that you need to do your work, like a
computer or printer, and you mainly use it for work, it is not considered a
benefit-in-kind. This means that you do not have to pay any tax for getting
the equipment from your employer.

##  How much can I claim?

You may have extra costs when you are working from home including heating,
electricity and broadband costs. Your employer can pay you a contribution
towards these costs or you can make a claim for tax relief during the year or
after the end of the year.

**If your employer pays you a working from home allowance** towards these
expenses, you can get up to €3.20 per day without paying any tax, PRSI or USC
on it. If your employer pays more than €3.20 per day to cover expenses, you
pay tax, PRSI and USC as normal on the amount above €3.20. You should note
that employers are not legally obliged to make this payment to their
employees.

**If your employer does not pay you a working from home allowance** for your
expenses, you can make a claim for tax relief during the year or after the end
of the year. You will get money back from the taxes you paid. If you share
your bills with someone else, the cost is divided between you, based on the
amount paid by each person (see Example 2 below).

The amount of costs you can claim is based on:

  * How many days you worked from home 
  * The cost of your expenses 
  * The percentage of your costs that Revenue counts as working from home expenses 

You can claim relief on the following:

  * From 2022, 30% of electricity, heating and internet costs 
  * For 2020 and 2021, 30% of internet costs and 10% of electricity and heating costs 

You can only claim for the days that you work from home. This does not include
times you may have brought work home to do outside your normal working hours.

Your annual costs are taken into account but you only get relief for the
proportion of the days you spent working from home during the year. For
example, in 2023 the proportion would be the number of days working from home
divided by 365. For 2020, it was a leap year so you divide by 366.

##  How to calculate the amount you can get tax relief on

To calculate the amount of costs you can get tax relief on:

  * Add your electricity, heating and internet costs and multiply the total costs by the number of days worked at home 
  * Divide by 365 (or 366 for a leap year) 
  * Multiply by 30% (0.3) 

For the years **2020 and 2021** , the relief for internet was 30%, as above.
However, the relief for electricity and heating was 10%, so these costs would
be calculated as follows:

  * Add the costs for electricity and heating and multiply the total costs by the number of days worked at home 
  * Divide by 365 (or 366 in 2020) 
  * Multiply by 10% (0.1) 

####  Amount of tax relief

When you know the amount of costs that you can get tax relief on you can
calculate your tax savings. You get tax relief on the amount of your costs at
a rate of 20% or 40%, whichever is the highest rate of income tax you pay.

If your employer pays you an allowance towards your expenses, that amount paid
is deducted from the amount you can claim back from Revenue.

###  Example 1

Mary worked from home for 9 months in 2021 while her office was closed due to
COVID-19. To make a claim, Mary needs to work out how many **working days**
she worked from home. She should exclude weekends, public holidays and any
annual leave taken during the 9 months she worked from home. Her total working
days are 168.

During 2021, her household bills for heating and electricity come to €1500 and
her broadband comes to €450.

To find out how much tax she can claim back, she:

  * Multiplies the amount due on the electricity and heating bills by the number of days she worked at home (€1500 x 168 = 252,000) 
  * Then, she divides her answer by 365 (252,000 / 365 = €690) 
  * Lastly, she calculates 10% of this amount to find out what she can claim for heating and electricity (10% of €689 is **€69** ) 

Mary uses the same method to see how much tax she can claim back on broadband.

  * €450 (broadband bill) x 168 (days worked) = 75,600 
  * 75,600 divided by 365 = €207 
  * Revenue will let Mary claim 30% of the cost of broadband in 2021. 30% of €207 is **€62** . 

This means, at the end of 2021, Mary can claim tax back on expenses of:

  * €69 for heating and electricity 
  * €62 for broadband 
  * **€131** in total 

The amount she gets back depends on her rate of tax. If she pays tax at the
higher tax rate of 40% she will get €52.40 back from her taxes (40% of €131).
If she pays tax at the lower rate of 20%, she will get €26.20 back (20% of
€131).

###  Example 2

Sharon and Lar are married and both worked from home for 181 days in 2020
while their offices were closed due to COVID-19. Their household bills for
heating and electricity come to €1,950 and their broadband comes to €600. They
split the bills equally between them and each calculate the portion they can
claim.

( **Note:** when calculating relief for 2020, divide by 366 days because it
was a leap year. For other years, divide by 365 days.)

**Cost of electricity and heat**

Amount paid each €975 x 181 = 176,475

Divided by 366 = €482

10% allowable cost = **€48**

**Cost of broadband**

Amount paid each €300 x 181 = 54,300

Divided by 366 = €148

30% allowable cost = **€45**

At the end of the year, Sharon and Lar can **each** claim tax back on expenses
of:

  * €48 for heating and electricity 
  * €45 for broadband 
  * **€93** in total 

The amount they gets back depends on their rate of tax. If they pay tax at the
higher tax rate of 40% they will **each** get €37.20 back (40% of €93). If
they pay tax at the lower rate of 20%, they will each get €18.60 back (20% of
€93).
