#  Tax relief on pensions

  * Introduction 
  * Tax relief on pension contributions 
  * Tax relief on lump sums at retirement 
  * How to apply 

##  Introduction

If you are a member of an approved pension scheme, you can get income tax
relief on your contributions to the scheme.

You pay tax on the pension when it is paid to you. For more information on the
way pension income is taxed see our page on [ taxation of pensions
](/en/money-and-tax/personal-finance/pensions/taxation-of-pensions/) .

The rate of tax relief on your pension contributions is at the highest rate of
income tax you pay, known as the marginal rate.

There are various rules that pension schemes must meet to get the tax relief
and there is a limit to the amount of the relief.

There is no relief on [ PRSI ](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-
system/social-insurance-prsi/social-insurance/) or the [ Universal Social
Charge ](/en/money-and-tax/tax/income-tax/universal-social-charge/) for
employee pension contributions.

##  Tax relief on pension contributions

When you pay into your pension, your pension contributions get [ income tax
relief at the marginal rate ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/money-and-
tax/tax/income-tax/how-your-tax-is-calculated/#d43041) .

You do not get relief on the [ Universal Social Charge (USC) ](/en/money-and-
tax/tax/income-tax/universal-social-charge/) or [ Pay Related Social Insurance
(PRSI) ](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/social-insurance-
prsi/) .

###  Limits on tax relief

There is a limit to the amount of pension contributions you can get tax relief
on in any one year.

There is also a limit to the total value of your pension fund that gets tax
relief.

####  Annual limit

The annual limit is a percentage of your income. The percentage depends on
your age.

**Tax relief limit as percentage of income** **Age** |  **Limit**  
---|---  
Under 30  |  15%   
30–39  |  20%   
40–49  |  25%   
50–54  |  30%   
55–59  |  35%   
60 or over  |  40%   
  
€115,000 is the maximum income that can be used to calculate the percentage.

For employees, income means gross pay (pay before deductions). If you are
self-employed, income means earnings less allowable expenses, also known as
_net relevant earnings_ .

If you are a professional sportsperson or in a profession that usually retires
at an earlier age than the norm, you can get tax relief on 30% of your net
relevant earnings regardless of your age.

If you have more than one source of income, the relief is only on the source
of income that contributions are made from.

**Limit on total value of fund**

There is a limit on the overall value of your pension fund that you can get
tax relief on. This is called the _Standard Fund Threshold_ . The Standard
Fund Threshold is €2 million. (A higher limit may apply if the fund was over
€2 million on 1 January 2014, this is called a [ Personal Fund Threshold (pdf)
](https://www.revenue.ie/en/tax-professionals/tdm/pensions/chapter-25.pdf) ).

If the fund is greater than the limit, tax at 40% will be charged on the
excess when you become entitled to receive it.

##  Tax relief on lump sums at retirement

When you retire, you can usually take part of your pension fund as a tax-free
lump sum. The amount you can take depends on the type of pension plan you have
and how much you have taken in tax-free lump sums from other pension plans.

There is a limit of €200,000 on the total amount of tax-free retirement lump
sums you can get. Lump sum payments are taxed as follows:

**Taxation of retirement lump sum** **Amount of lump sum** |  **Income tax rate**  
---|---  
Up to €200,000  |  0%   
€200,000–€500,000  |  20%   
Over €500,000  |  [ Marginal rate ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/money-and-tax/tax/income-tax/how-your-tax-is-calculated/#d43041)  
  
There may be a [ limit to how much you can take out of your pension, depending
on the type of pension
](https://pensionsauthority.ie/lifecycle/benefits_payable_on_retirement/lump_sums/)
.

##  How to apply

Usually your employer deducts the contributions directly from your pay and
will give you the tax relief due.

If your employer does not deduct the contributions, you can use [ myAccount
](https://www.ros.ie/myaccount-web/sign_in.html?execution=e1s1) to complete
and file an income tax return.

If you’re self-employed, you can apply for tax relief on contributions by
using the [ Revenue Online Service (ROS) ](https://www.revenue.ie/en/online-
services/index.aspx) .

Revenue has [ a video explaining how to claim tax relief for pension
contributions ](https://www.revenue.ie/en/self-assessment-and-self-
employment/filing-your-tax-return/help-claiming-a-relief-for-pension-
