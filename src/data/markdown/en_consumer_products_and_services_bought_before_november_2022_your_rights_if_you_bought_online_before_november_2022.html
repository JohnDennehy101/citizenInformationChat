##  Introduction

This page explains your consumer rights if you bought something online, by
catalogue or over the phone **on or before 28 November 2022** . These rights
apply if you bought online from a trader based in Ireland or the EU.

You have different rights if you:

  * Bought online, by catalogue or over the phone on or after 29 November 2022. This is because the [ Consumer Rights Act 2022 (pdf) ](https://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2022/act/37/enacted/en/pdf) introduced [ new rights ](/en/consumer/shopping/shopping-online/) . 
  * Bought from a [ trader in the UK ](/en/consumer/shopping/buying-online-from-uk-after-brexit/)

##  Your rights

If you bought online, you have the same rights under consumer law as [ buying
in a shop. ](/en/consumer/shopping/rights-when-buying-in-a-shop/)

###  Quality, performance and durability

Under the [ Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Act, 1980
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1980/act/16/enacted/en/html) the goods
you bought must meet standards of quality, performance and durability.

Goods must be:

  * **Of satisfactory (merchantable) quality** taking into account durability and price 
  * **Fit for the purpose** you bought it 
  * **As described,** matching any description advertised or other information the seller gave you 

###  Extra rights

When you bought goods online, you entered into a contract called a _distance
contract._ A distance contract covers sales that were done online, over the
phone, by mail order, or from a door-to-door salesperson.

With this type of contract, you did not enter into the contract in person and
you could not check the products before you bought them. Because of this, you
have extra protections under EU law.

###  Bought online from a UK trader

If you bought online from a UK trader after 1 January 2021, you may not
automatically have the same consumer rights. You can read more about [ buying
online from the UK after Brexit. ](/en/consumer/shopping/buying-online-from-
uk-after-brexit/)

##  If your delayed or non-delivery

You have the following rights around delayed deliveries or non-delivery:

  * You must get your goods within 30 days of buying them (unless you agreed to a different timeframe for delivery) 
  * If the goods are not delivered within the time agreed, you can ask the seller to deliver the items again by an agreed date 
  * If the seller does not deliver within this additional period, you can cancel the contract and get a full refund without delay 
  * If, at the time of buying the goods, you told the seller that delivery by a certain date was essential (for example, for an event) and the seller agreed, you can cancel the contract and get a refund if they donâ€™t meet the promised delivery date 
  * You can cancel the contract and get a refund if the seller has stated that they cannot or will not deliver the goods 

The [ Consumer Rights Directive 2011/83/EU (CRD) ](https://eur-
lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2011:304:0064:0088:en:PDF)
sets out the rules on delayed and non-deliveries.

##  Faulty goods

You have a right to certain _remedies_ when something you buy is not of
merchantable quality, fit for purchase or as described. A remedy can be a [
repair, replacement or refund. ](/en/consumer/shopping/problems-with-faulty-
goods/)

If the fault appears within the first 6 months, it is assumed that there was a
problem when you got the goods and it is up to the seller to prove otherwise.
If the fault appears after the first 6 months, you can be asked to prove that
there was a problem when you got it.

Read more about [ guarantees and warranties
](/en/consumer/shopping/guarantees-and-warranties/) and [ repairs,
replacements and refunds. ](/en/consumer/shopping/problems-with-faulty-goods/)

##  Other consumer rights when shopping online

You have the following extra rights under EU law when shopping online:

  * Right to equal access to websites throughout the EU 
  * Protection against certain practices that are banned within the EU 

###  Equal access to websites throughout the EU

Under rules on geo-blocking, you have the right to equal access to the digital
market throughout the EU regardless of where you are living.

The [ Geo-blocking Regulation (EU Regulation 2018/302) (pdf) ](https://eur-
lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32018R0302&from=EN) has
applied across the EU since December 2018 and aims to stop the practices of
geo-blocking and geo-discrimination.

As a result of the Geo-blocking Regulation, businesses within the EU are not
allowed to:

  * Restrict your access to a website that was intended for consumers within a particular geographic area 
  * Force you to buy from a particular website intended for that country or group of countries alone 
  * Limit you to a particular website, even if you consent to being redirected to that website 
  * Automatically redirect you to another website set up for that location 
  * Treat payment methods differently based on your location 

â€˜Geo-discriminationâ€™ can also happen off-line. For example, if you are
physically present in a traderâ€™s premises and you are prevented from buying a
product or offered different conditions, such as higher price, because of your
nationality or place of residence.

The European Commission has more information about [ geo-blocking
](https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/geo-blocking-digital-single-
market) .

##  Other banned practices under CRD

The CRD bans a number of practices across the EU, including:

Ban on pre-ticked boxes  |  EU traders are banned from using pre-ticked boxes on websites to charge extra for services (such as priority boarding on planes)   
---|---  
Ban on surcharges  |  Traders are not allowed to charge more for particular payment types, for example credit card payments, than it costs them to provide such payment option   
Ban on hidden fees and charges  |  You do not have to pay for any delivery costs or other charges which you were not told about in advance   
Passing of risk  |  The trader is responsible for any damage to or loss of your goods from the time they are dispatched until you (or a third-party chosen by you) receive them   
  
##  If things go wrong

Shopping online is convenient, but it can be harder to sort out problems. If
things go wrong, contact the seller (in writing if possible) explaining what
the issue is and how you want it corrected.

###  If you are not satisfied with the sellerâ€™s response

If the problem is not resolved within a reasonable timeframe or you are not
happy with the sellerâ€™s response, you can:

Contact the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC) for
information and advice

Contact your bank or credit card provider to use chargeback. The CCPC has more
information [ on chargeback ](https://www.ccpc.ie/consumers/money/credit-
cards/disputed-card-transactions-chargeback/)

Take a claim against the seller using the [ Small Claims Procedure
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/justice/courts_system/small_claims_court.en.html)

Find out more about [ making a complaint ](/en/consumer/how-to-complain/how-
to-make-a-complaint/) and [ consumer protection organisations.
