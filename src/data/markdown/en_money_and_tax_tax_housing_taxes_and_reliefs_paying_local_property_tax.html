  * Paying in instalments 
  * Payment dates 
  * Paying LPT arrears 
  * Where to apply 

##  Introduction

You can pay your Local Property Tax (LPT) in one single payment, or you can
pay in equal instalments over the year. You can change to a different payment
method at any time during the year by sending a request to Revenue.

This page explains how to pay the LPT. For information on who has to pay the
LPT, how much it is and how to make a return, [ read more about the Local
Property Tax (LPT). ](/en/money-and-tax/tax/housing-taxes-and-reliefs/local-
property-tax/)

You can [ defer payment of LPT ](/en/money-and-tax/tax/housing-taxes-and-
reliefs/deferring-local-property-tax/) if you meet certain conditions.

**If you paid LPT for 2023**

If you paid LPT for 2023 with a repeating payment method, such as a direct
debit, the payment will continue in 2024 unless you choose a different way to
pay. Repeating methods include LPT deductions from your salary, pension, or
social protection payment. If you have changed banks, you may need to [ update
your direct debit ](https://www.revenue.ie/en/property/local-property-
tax/paying-your-lpt/changing-bank-details.aspx) .

If you paid LPT for 2023 with a type of payment that does not automatically
repeat, you need to choose how you want to pay LPT for 2024. You can do this
in your [ Revenue property record ](https://www.revenue.ie/en/property/local-
property-tax/lpt-liability/your-revenue-property-record.aspx) .

You should have confirmed your payment method with Revenue by:

  * 1 December 2023, if you choose to spread the payments over the year 
  * 10 January 2024, if you choose to pay in a single payment 

**If you did not pay 2023 LPT**

If your property was not liable for LPT on 1 November 2022 but is liable on 1
November 2023, you must [ submit an LPT return
](local_property_tax.en.html#l5f2b1) by 1 December 2023.

If you need help, you can contact the [ LPT helpline
](https://www.revenue.ie/en/contact-us/customer-service-contact/lpt-vht.aspx)
. You can also send queries to Revenue through [ myEnquiries
](https://www.revenue.ie/en/online-services/services/manage-your-
record/myenquiries.aspx) .

##  Paying your Local Property Tax

To pay your LPT, you will need your Property ID and PIN, which you can find on
any LPT correspondence you have received from Revenue.

If you do not have your Property ID and PIN, you can use the [ LPT online
service ](https://lpt.revenue.ie/lpt-web/views/login.html?execution=e1s1) to
request them.

You can choose to pay your LPT

  * In full in a single payment or 
  * Over a number of payments 

For both options, there are different payment methods available.

##  Making a single payment

You can pay your LPT **in full** by:

  * **Debit/credit card** : This option is available online. Note that if you pay by debit card or credit card the payment will be processed immediately. 
  * **Annual Debit Instruction (ADI)** : Under a single debit instruction you can authorise your bank or financial institution to pay Revenue the LPT due. The full payment is taken from your bank account on a date you choose, up to 21 March 2024. Your ADI will carry forward each year unless you change your payment option online or contact Revenue. 
  * **Cash payments** : you can pay in full by cash through an approved Payment Service Provider, up to 10 January 2024. A transaction charge usually applies. You can [ view Payment Service Providers and their charges ](https://www.revenue.ie/en/property/local-property-tax/paying-your-lpt/paying-lpt-phased-payments.aspx) . 

##  Paying in instalments

You can pay your LPT in regular payments that are spread throughout the year.
You can pay the instalments by:

  * Monthly **direct debit** . 
  * Monthly or weekly **cash payments** through an [ approved Payment Service Provider ](https://www.revenue.ie/en/property/local-property-tax/paying-your-lpt/paying-lpt-phased-payments.aspx) . 
  * **Deduction at source** . You can have payments deducted from your wages or occupational pension. LPT can also be deducted from payments you get from the Department of Social Protection (DSP) or from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine (DAFM). 

You can change your payment method at any time during the year. [ Contact the
Revenue LPT Unit ](https://www.revenue.ie/en/contact-us/customer-service-
contact/lpt-vht.aspx) .

###  Direct debit

If you choose to set up a monthly direct debit, you need to do this online
using the [ LPT online service ](https://lpt.revenue.ie/lpt-
web/views/login.html?execution=e1s1) .

Your monthly direct debit for LPT will carry forward each year unless you
change your payment option online or contact Revenue.

###  Cash payments through an approved Payment Service Provider

You can pay your LPT by cash:

  * In a single payment by 10 January 2024 or 
  * In regular payments each week or month throughout the year, if you choose this option by 1 December 2023 

You can choose this option through [ myAccount ](https://www.ros.ie/myaccount-
web/sign_in.html) , [ ROS ](https://www.ros.ie/) or the [ LPT online service
](https://lpt.revenue.ie/lpt-web/views/login.html) .

You can view information about the approved [ cash Payment Service Providers
and the transaction fees they charge
](https://www.revenue.ie/en/property/local-property-tax/paying-your-
lpt/paying-lpt-phased-payments.aspx) .

###  Deduction from your wages or from payments you get

You can choose to have your LPT deducted directly from:

  * Your salary, wages, or occupational pension 
  * Payments from the Department of Social Protection 
  * Payments by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine (if you have a herd number) 

This is called deduction at source. View the list of [ payments you can use to
pay LPT by deduction at source ](https://www.revenue.ie/en/property/local-
property-tax/paying-your-lpt/lpt-phased-payments-deduction-at-source.aspx) .

The deductions are spread evenly across the number of payments you get during
the year.

The Department of Social Protection will only deduct LPT from the amount of
your payment that is over €218. If that is not enough to pay your LPT, you
must use another payment method during the year to make the additional
payments.

You can pay by deduction at source using the [ LPT online service
](https://lpt.revenue.ie/lpt-web/views/login.html) .

##  Payment dates

##  Paying LPT arrears

If you have not filed an LPT Return or paid your LPT for previous years, you
should pay and file as soon as possible. If you do not pay the outstanding
amounts, Revenue will contact you and let you know how they intend to recover
the debt. Read more about [ paying LPT arrears
](https://www.revenue.ie/en/property/local-property-tax/paying-your-
lpt/paying-lpt-arrears-2013-2021.aspx) .

Revenue will also recover arrears of the [ Household Charge
](https://www.revenue.ie/en/property/local-property-tax/lpt-
for-2013/household-charge-hhc.aspx) (which is now collected through the LPT
system).

Collection methods include:

  * Mandatory deduction from your salary, wages or occupational pension 
  * Attachment of your bank account (this means taking money without your consent using an attachment order) 
  * Referral of the debt to a sheriff or a solicitor for collection 
  * The withholding of refunds of other taxes as payment against LPT due 

If you are self-employed and fail to pay your LPT or Household Charge arrears,
Revenue will not issue you a [ tax clearance certificate ](/en/money-and-
tax/tax/tax-clearance-certificate/) .
