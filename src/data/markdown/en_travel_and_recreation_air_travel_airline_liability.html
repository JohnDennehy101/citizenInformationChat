#  Airline liability

  * International laws for air travel 
  * Death or injury to passengers 
  * Lost or damaged luggage 
  * Delayed passengers and luggage 
  * Missing or damaged luggage 
  * Claiming compensation 

##  International laws for air travel

Airlines have many responsibilities to their passengers, cargo, and luggage.
International laws provide a worldwide system of standards and rules for air
travel. These laws provide minimum liability limits for the carriage of
passengers, cargo and luggage in the event of death, injury, damage, delay or
loss. These laws were first agreed upon and introduced worldwide in 1929.

###  **Warsaw Convention 1929**

The first international law introduced, is known as the Warsaw Convention
(1929). There have since been several changes and reviews to the original
Warsaw Convention. This includes increases to the monetary liability limits.
These amendments together with the original Warsaw Convention are known
collectively as the _Warsaw System._

Over time the liability limits became outdated and were considered too low by
present-day standards. In addition, the laws governing airline liability
became fragmented and confusing, as some countries did not introduce all the
various amendments to the original laws.

###  The Montreal Convention 1999

The Montreal Convention (1999), titled the [ Convention for the Unification of
Certain Rules for International Carriage by Air (pdf) ](https://eur-
lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=LEGISSUM%3Al24255) amended the Warsaw
System. It re-established a common set of rules relating to the international
carriage of passengers, luggage and cargo. The provisions of the convention
include:

  * Unlimited liability in the event of death or injury of passengers 
  * Advanced payments to meet immediate needs 
  * The possibility of bringing a lawsuit before the courts in the passenger's principal place of residence 
  * Increased liability limits in the event of delay 
  * The modernisation of transport documents (electronic tickets) 
  * The clarification of rules on the respective liability of the contractual carrier and the actual carrier 
  * The obligation for air carriers to maintain adequate insurance 

###  Special Drawing Rights (SDR)

Under the Montreal Convention, the liability limits are set in [ Special
Drawing Rights (SDR) ](http://www.imf.org/external/np/exr/facts/sdr.htm) .
These are a mix of currency values set up by the International Monetary Fund
(IMF). The [ current value of an SDR in Euro is available on the IMF's website
](http://www.imf.org/external/np/fin/data/rms_mth.aspx?reportType=CVSDR) . The
liability limits are reviewed every 5 years.

###  **Travelling with EU airlines**

In 1997, the EU introduced legislation to ensure that the same limits were in
place for all EU member states. This standardised the liability of EU airlines
(in case of death or injury to passengers).

[ EU Regulation 889/2002 (pdf) ](http://eur-
lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2002:140:0002:0005:EN:PDF) was
introduced to amend the 1997 Regulation. This brought the EU states into line
with the Montreal Convention. It standardised liability limits and legal
defences in respect of European carriers, regardless of whether the accident
happened on an international flight or a flight within the EU.

Under this Regulation, an EU airline must be insured to a level that allows
for all persons entitled to compensation to receive the full amount to which
they are entitled. The airline must also provide each passenger with a written
indication of the liability limit for the flight in respect of:

  * Death or injury 
  * Luggage which is destroyed, lost or damaged 
  * Damage caused by delay 

##  Death or injury to passengers

In case of death, wounding or any other bodily injury, there is no financial
limit on the liability of an EU airline for damages sustained. For damages up
to 128,821 SDRs, the airline cannot contest compensation claims. Above that
amount, the airline can defend itself against a claim by proving that it was
not negligent or otherwise at fault.

If for example, you are injured or killed, the airline must make an advance
payment to cover immediate economic needs within 15 days. In case of death,
this advanced payment must be at least 16,000 SDRs. However an advance payment
is not a recognition of liability, and may be offset against any further
payments.

Any court action to claim damages must be taken within 2 years from the date
the plane arrived or should have arrived.

##  Lost or damaged luggage

The airline is liable if your luggage is lost, destroyed or damaged:

  * In the case of checked luggage, the airline is liable even if it is not at fault (unless the luggage is defective) 
  * In the case of unchecked luggage, it is only liable if it is at fault 

If your luggage has been damaged or destroyed, you must make a written
complaint to the airline within 7 days. Your luggage is considered lost if it
has not arrived within 21 days from the date it was supposed to have arrived.
You should make a written complaint about your lost luggage as soon as
possible after the 21 days.

The airline is liable for destruction, loss or damages of up to 1,288 SDRs.

You can make a special declaration before checking in your luggage. You pay a
supplementary fee.

##  Delayed passengers and luggage

An airline is liable to pay for damages of up to 5, 346 SDRs if you are
delayed. If your luggage is delayed, the airline is liable to pay for damages
of up to 1,288 SDRs. The airline is not liable for damages where the airline
took all reasonable measures or it was impossible to take such measure

Complain in writing within 21 days of you receiving the luggage.

See our page on [ compensation for overbooked, cancelled and delayed flights
in the EU ](/en/travel-and-recreation/air-travel/compensation-for-overbooked-
and-delayed-flights/) .

###  Travelling with non-EU airlines

The liability limits in various countries around the world can vary, this is
due to the complex nature of laws governing airline liability. In countries
that are covered by the Montreal Convention, the liability limits are the same
as for EU airlines. Whether you would be entitled to an advance payment in
case of an injury or death (and how much), depends on the law of the country.

You should get adequate travel insurance before your journey. Check the
liability limits for the airline you are travelling with beforehand.

##  Missing or damaged luggage

If your luggage is missing or damaged, you should:

###  1\. Report the problem to the customer service desk of your airline

If your luggage does not arrive at the airport (or it is damaged or
destroyed). Report the problem to the customer service desk of your airline.
Check if the airline uses an online tracking system for luggage. Do this at
the airport baggage claims hall.

###  2\. Complete a Property Irregularity Report (PIR)

You should complete a Property Irregularity Report (PIR). The PIR will include
details of your flight (for example, the airline, date, flight number and
time), your luggage, your name, and your address. You will be given a copy of
the PIR which you should keep, and the airline will keep the other copy.

###  3\. Keep the luggage labels and your boarding card

You should also keep the luggage labels you were given when you checked in
your luggage and your boarding card. The luggage labels have a barcode and a
number. This reference number relates to your luggage and will help the
airline identify your luggage and help trace it for you.

###  4\. Keep your receipts

If your luggage is not returned during your holiday or journey, you should
keep receipts for items you had to buy because of your missing luggage.

If your luggage is damaged or destroyed it can be useful to take photographs.

##  Claiming compensation

###  1\. Put your complaint in writing

You should put your complaint to the airline in writing. You should include:

  * Copies of the PIR 
  * Luggage labels 
  * Boarding card, and 
  * Any other relevant documentation such as receipts and photographs. 

You may need a written estimate for the cost of repairing or replacing
luggage.

###  2\. Complain within the time limits

You must make your complaint within certain time limits:

  * If your luggage has been damaged or destroyed, make your complaint within 7 days 
  * If your luggage has been delayed, make your complaint within 21 days of receiving it 
  * If your luggage has been lost, make your complaint as soon as possible after it has been missing for 21 days 

If you are bringing a case to court, you must claim for damages within 2
years. This is from the date the plane arrived or should have arrived.

###  3\. Contact your travel insurance

If you have holiday insurance, you should contact your insurance company and
report the loss or damage to your luggage as soon as possible.
