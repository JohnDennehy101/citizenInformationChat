##  Introduction

If you become ill or disabled in older age, you can get payments and services
to support you. Your age and your needs will decide which payments and
services you can get.

##  Housing supports for older people who are ill

There are [ housing grants available for older people
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/housing/housing-grants-and-
schemes/older-people-housing/) and people with disabilities. If you need to
adapt your home to continue living there, you may qualify for the [ Housing
Adaptation Grant for People with a Disability
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/housing/housing-grants-and-
schemes/housing-supports-for-older-people-and-people-with-
disabilities/housing-adaptation-grant-for-people-with-disability/) .

Housing adaptations can include:

  * Adding a downstairs bedroom 
  * Making the house wheelchair-accessible 
  * Putting in a ground-floor bathroom 

You may qualify for the [ Housing Aid for Older Persons Scheme
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/housing/housing-grants-and-
schemes/housing-aid-for-older-people-grant/) to help pay for minor repairs to
your home, for example, by replacing the windows or upgrading the electrical
wiring.

You might also qualify for the [ Mobility Aids Grant Scheme
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/housing/housing-grants-and-
schemes/mobility-aids-grant-scheme/) from [ your local authority
](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/942f74-local-authorities/) to fix mobility
problems in the home. For example, it can help you pay for grab-rails on your
stairs

###  **If your own home is not suitable for you to live in**

You may be able to get a specially adapted local authority house for older
people and people with disabilities, or an adapted house provided by a
voluntary housing organisation.

The availability of such houses, and eligibility for them, varies around the
country. Contact [ your local authority
](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/942f74-local-authorities/) for more
information.

####  Moving to a nursing home

If you are moving to a nursing home, you may be able to apply for [ the Fair
Deal scheme ](/en/health/health-services/health-services-for-older-
people/fair-deal-scheme/) . This is a financial support to help you pay for
care in a nursing home. There is [ tax relief on nursing home fees

services-for-older-people/tax-relief-on-nursing-home-fees-and-for-dependent-

##  Paying for health services and claiming tax relief

hospitals ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/health/health-services/gp-
and-hospital-services/hospital-charges/) .

hospital-services/hospital-charges/) if you are a public in-patient or
attending a day service.

If you choose private hospital care, you must pay the total costs involved.

](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/health/health-system/private-health-
insurance/) .
