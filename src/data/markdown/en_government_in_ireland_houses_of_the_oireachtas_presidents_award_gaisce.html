##  What is the Gaisce award?

The President’s Award – called Gaisce – is a self-development programme for
young people in Ireland between the ages of 14 and 25. The word Gaisce means
great achievement. If you win an award you get a medal in a presentation box,
a certificate signed by the President and a lapel pin. If you win the Gold
award the president presents it to you at a special ceremony at Dublin Castle.

The [ Wavelength programme ](https://www.gaisce.ie/wavelength/) has been
created to support young people who are refugees or seeking asylum to achieve
their Gaisce Awards.

There is [ detailed information about Gaisce ](http://www.gaisce.ie/about-
gaisce/) on gaisce.ie.

##  How can I get a Gaisce award?

To achieve a Gaisce award, you set a demanding challenge for yourself in 4
different areas of activity:

  * Community involvement - for example, helping older people or learning first aid or lifesaving skills 
  * Personal skill - for example, learning a musical instrument, computer skills or driving 
  * Physical recreation - for example, swimming, football or tennis 
  * Adventure journey - for example, a cycling, canoeing or hiking group trip 

To achieve the top level of award (Gold) you must also take part in a
residential project, such as a residential Irish-language course, a
residential sports course or a work placement in a care home.

When you have completed your personal challenges, you will earn your award.

###  President's Award Leaders (PALs)

You will need a [ President's Award Leader (PAL) ](http://gaisce.ie/pals-5/)
\- an adult supervisor, who will support and mentor you along the way to your
Gaisce award.

A PAL is someone who works with a youth centred organisation and who has
applied to the programme and been accepted. As well as providing training for
PALs and verifying their references, Gaisce ensures that they are [ Garda
vetted. ](/en/employment/employment-rights-and-conditions/data-protection-at-
work/garda-vetting/)

##  Levels of Gaisce award

##  How to apply

###  For Gaisce applicants

guardian.

Your PAL will monitor you during your Gaisce challenge and sign off at the
end, if you have carried out your agreed challenges and met the standard of
the award.

###  For PALs

To become a Gaisce PAL, you must attend a one-day training workshop. You must
also be [ Garda vetted ](/en/employment/employment-rights-and-conditions/data-
protection-at-work/garda-vetting/) and have your references verified. [ For
