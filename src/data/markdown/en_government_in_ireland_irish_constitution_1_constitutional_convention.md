##  What was the Constitutional Convention?

The Convention on the Constitution, often called the Constitutional
Convention, was established by [ resolution of both Houses of the Oireachtas
(pdf)
](http://www.constitutionalconvention.ie/Documents/Terms_of_Reference.pdf) in
2012 to consider a number of possible changes to the Constitution and make
recommendations. The resolution committed the Government to providing a
response to each recommendation.

The Convention met over 18 months between 2012 and 2014. It discussed 10
issues in all. Several of its recommendations resulted in amendments to the
Constitution.

##  How did the Constitutional Convention work?

The Constitutional Convention used the model of [ deliberative democracy (pdf)
](https://www.ucd.ie/t4cms/CASE_STUDY8_David Farrell.pdf) , in which citizens
participate directly in decision-making. Deliberative democracy involves:

  * Random selection of ordinary citizens, who are provided with objective information 
  * Expert presentations for participants to listen to and question 
  * Facilitated small-group discussions about policy issues 
  * Recommendations fed into the political process 

The Convention’s work was guided by five key principles:

  * Openness 
  * Fairness 
  * Equality of voice 
  * Efficiency 
  * Collegiality 

###  Structures and procedures

The Convention had [ 100 participants (pdf)
](http://www.constitutionalconvention.ie/Documents/Terms_of_Reference.pdf) .
The Government appointed a chairman. Sixty-six citizens were [ randomly
selected (pdf)
](http://www.constitutionalconvention.ie/Documents/BehaviourAndAttitudes.pdf)
, to be as representative as possible of Irish society in terms of gender,
age, social class and geographical location. The people chosen had to be on
the [ Register of Electors ](/en/government-in-ireland/elections-and-
referenda/voting/registering-to-vote/) and entitled to vote in a referendum.

The other 33 participants were members of the Dáil and Seanad and a
representative of each political party in the Northern Ireland Assembly that
wished to be represented.

The Convention’s work was supported by an expert advisory group of academics,
political scientists and constitutional lawyers who submitted presentations on
a range of topics. A wide range of [ public bodies and interest groups also
made submissions ](http://www.constitutionalconvention.ie/Submissions.aspx) to
the Convention.

##  Further information

In its [ final report (pdf)
](http://www.constitutionalconvention.ie/AttachmentDownload.ashx?mid=55f2ba29-aab8-e311-a7ce-005056a32ee4)
in 2014, the Convention recommended that a similar convention be created to
address additional issues.

In 2016, the [ Citizens’ Assembly ](/en/government-in-ireland/irish-
constitution-1/citizens-assembly/) was set up to consider further legal and
policy issues facing Irish society. This was another exercise in deliberative
democracy.
