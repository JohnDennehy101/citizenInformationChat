##  What is Transition Year (TY)?

Transition Year (also called TY) is an optional one-year programme between [
Junior Cycle ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/education/state-
examinations/junior-cycle-exam-and-results/) and [ Senior Cycle
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/education/primary-and-post-primary-
education/going-to-post-primary-school/senior-cycle/) . Transition Year is
part of a 3-year Senior Cycle, but it is separate to the [ Leaving Certificate
programme ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/education/state-
examinations/leaving-certificate/) which lasts 2 years.

Transition Year can help students as they change from the more dependent
learning of the Junior Cycle to the more independent, self-directed learning
of the Senior Cycle. It also offers opportunities for personal, social and
academic development and experience of adult and working life.

All post-primary schools have the option of offering the Transition Year
programme to their students and most of them do offer it.

###  **Aims of the Transition Year programme**

Transition Year offers students an opportunity to:

  * Engage in independent, self-directed learning 
  * Develop general, technical and academic skills 
  * Develop work-related skills 
  * Develop social skills such as communication and building self-confidence 

##  How does Transition Year work?

Each school designs its own TY programme to suit the needs and interests of
its students. Schools must design the TY programme within set [ Transition
Year guidelines for schools (pdf)
](https://curriculumonline.ie/getmedia/9154f9d9-ad71-4be8-a2f1-1ba24684a766/ty_transition_year_school_guidelines.pdf)
and include core subjects that all students take for the full year, for
example, maths, English and Irish.

Transition Year is optional and admission criteria vary from school to school.

Activities and areas of study may include:

  * Environmental studies 
  * Drama 
  * Psychology 
  * Studies in language, tourism and business 
  * Social outreach 
  * Field trips and outdoor pursuits 
  * Media and communications 

Students can sample different subjects and areas of interest. This can help
them make informed choices about the optional subjects available for the
Leaving Certificate programme.

Read more about the [ Transition Year curriculum
](https://www.pdst.ie/TY/curriculum) .

###  **Road Safety Transition Year programme**

The Road Safety Authority has designed a [ new 10-week programme about road
safety and learning to drive ](https://www.rsa.ie/road-
safety/education/secondary/transition-year) for Transition Year students.
‘Road Safety Matters’ covers different topics, such as the components of a car
and the dangers of alcohol, drugs and distractions while driving.

Read more about [ learning to drive
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/travel-and-recreation/motoring/driver-
licensing/learning-to-drive/) .

###  **New Transition Year programme statement**

From September 2025, a new [ Transition Year programme statement (pdf)
](https://curriculumonline.ie/getmedia/5849acbf-0326-487a-beec-3db6b5878470/TY-
Programme-Statement-ENG-INT.pdf) will replace the existing guidelines.

The new statement encourages schools to create Transition Year programmes that
let students develop across 4 key areas:

  * Personal growth 
  * Being a learner 
  * Civic and community engagement 
  * Career exploration 

##  Work experience

Work experience is a core part of Transition Year. It aims to bring new kinds
of learning opportunities to students by experiencing working life. It also
helps students get some work experience for their CV, which is useful when
looking for jobs in the future.

You do not have to find work experience in an area you want to work in later
in life, but it is more enjoyable to try to get work experience in something
that interests you.

###  **How to find a work experience placement**

Finding work experience can take time, so it is a good idea to start looking
for places that might offer it as soon as possible.

You can find work experience by:

  * Asking around local businesses, such as shops or offices 
  * Seeing if your school has any links with local companies or organisations who have dedicated Transition Year programmes – your guidance councillor or Transition Year Co-ordinator may be able to assist with this 
  * Asking your family or friends if they know anyone in an industry that interests you 
  * Finding out about volunteer opportunities with local community groups or organisations – you can find different volunteer roles on the [ National Volunteering database ](https://www.i-vol.ie/advanced-search/)
  * Speaking with your local [ Youth Information Officer ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/birth-family-relationships/services-and-supports-for-children/youth-information-centres/) about any opportunities that may be available 
  * Searching online – the Careers Portal website has [ a database of available work experience placements ](https://careersportal.ie/workx/student_search.php)

You can use the [ Careers Portal work worksheet (pdf)
](https://cc.careersportal.ie/pdfs/WorkPlacementWorksheetStudentsWeb.pdf) to
help you find and prepare for work experience.

###  **Applying for work experience**

Some workplaces have their own dedicated Transition Year work experience
programmes and application forms.

Research the places you are thinking of applying to and speak to your guidance
councillor or Transition Year co-ordinator if you need help with the
application process or what information you need to apply.

It is useful to phone to find out to whom a letter of application should be
addressed, so that it reaches the right person and you know who to follow up
with at a later date.

####  **Writing a cover letter and a CV**

You should write a cover letter and put together a Curriculum Vitae (CV) that
you can give to potential employers as part of applying for work experience
(and for [ applying for jobs in the future
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/employment/starting-work-and-changing-
job/training-and-looking-for-work/finding-and-getting-a-job/) in general).

Your cover letter should include:

  * Your name and your contact details 
  * Your school and what year you are in 
  * Why you are writing to the employer (to ask about work experience opportunities) 
  * Why you want to work in the place you’re applying to 
  * The dates and times you are available for work experience (can you do full days or mornings or afternoons only, for example) 
  * A copy of your CV 

If you are writing to many places, you should tailor your cover letter to suit
the place you are writing to.

A CV typically includes your:

  * Contact details 
  * Qualifications and training 
  * Work experience to date 
  * Key skills 
  * Personal interests and achievements 
  * References[ 

As a Transition Year student, you might not have any work experience or
references to include, so you don’t need to worry about that.

You can just include the other information, along with your Junior Cycle
results (which might be helpful if you’re applying for a job which involves a
subject you did well in). Read more about [ making a CV on Spuntout.ie
](https://spunout.ie/employment/apply-job/how-to-write-a-cv/) .

##  Parents and Transition Year

Schools are encouraged to involve parents in the decision-making process and
planning for Transition Year.

Most schools arrange sessions for parents of third-year students to explain
Transition Year and how it works. Some schools run a 'Student Introduction to
Transition Year' seminar for Junior Cycle students to prepare them for the
year ahead.

Some ways parents can help during Transition Year include:

  * Attending classes during the year as visiting speakers to talk about their work and areas of expertise 
  * Assisting with the work experience programme if they are in a position to offer placements 

Parents are also invited to contribute to evaluating the Transition Year
programme so that it can be improved the following year.

##  Transition Year assessment and certification

There is no end-of-year state examination in Transition Year. This is to allow
students to learn, mature and develop without the pressure of an upcoming
exam.

Schools use school-based assessment, which helps students learn about their
own strengths and weaknesses, and develop skills of self-assessment and
reflection.

School-based assessment is ongoing, and can include:

  * Portfolio making 
  * Project work 
  * Exhibitions of students’ work 
  * Oral, written and practical activities 
  * Evaluation of work experience or community service activities by the employer or hosts 

Students who have successfully completed the Transition Year programme are
usually awarded a certificate of participation by their school.
