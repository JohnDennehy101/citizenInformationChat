#  Jobseeker's Benefit and work

  * Introduction 
  * How work is assessed for Jobseeker's Benefit 
  * Civil partner, spouse or cohabitant working and Jobseeker’s Benefit 
  * How to apply 

##  Introduction

One of the conditions for getting Jobseeker’s Benefit is that you must be
unemployed. However, you do not have to be totally unemployed – you must have
had a substantial loss of employment and be unemployed for at least 4 days out
of the 7-day employment week. Your earnings must also have reduced because of
the loss of employment.

You must also be available for and actively seeking work and you must meet all
the other [ conditions for Jobseeker’s Benefit ](/en/social-
welfare/unemployed-people/jobseekers-benefit/) . For example, you must have
enough social insurance (PRSI) contributions.

You may work and get Jobseeker’s Benefit if:

  1. Your days at work are reduced due to lack of work (systematic short-time working) 
  2. You are a part-time worker including job-sharing week on and week off (but not if you have chosen to do so) 
  3. You get casual work or part-time work 
  4. You have _subsidiary employment_

This page also looks at how taking up temporary work affects your Jobseeker’s
Benefit.

**Is Jobseeker’s Benefit taxable?**

Jobseeker’s Benefit is taxable in addition to any income from work.

However, it is not taxable if you are getting it because your hours at work
are temporarily reduced (systematic short-time working).

You can read more about [ taxation of Jobseeker’s Benefit
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-
system/claiming-a-social-welfare-payment/taxation-of-social-welfare-payments/)
.

##  How work is assessed for Jobseeker's Benefit

###  1\. If your days at work are reduced (temporarily) - systematic short-
time

If you normally work full-time but short-time working is introduced by your
employer, you may get Jobseeker’s Benefit (JB). Reduced working hours on a
temporary basis is called _systematic short-time working_ .

You will get JB for the days you don't work provided you meet the other
conditions that apply to JB, for example, you cannot work more than 3 days per
week. If you work 4 days, you are no longer entitled to claim JB (because you
must be unemployed for 4 out of 7 days).

For systematic short-time workers the social welfare week is based on 5 days.
This means that days worked and days of unemployment added together cannot be
more than 5.

For example, if your days of work are reduced to 3 days per week, you will get
JB for the other 2 days and you will use up 2 days of your total JB
entitlement. This means you will get 2/5ths of the normal amount of
Jobseeker's Benefit (see table below).

In these circumstances, if you are entitled to 234 days JB (9 months) you
could continue to claim JB for 117 weeks. However, the Department of Social
Protection (DSP) will reassess a systematic short time worker’s JB claim if it
goes on for an extended period. If the DSP decides that it is unlikely you
will return to full-time work with that company in the short term, you will be
reassessed as a part-time worker.

You can read a case study showing you [ how to calculate the length of time a
short time worker can get Jobseeker's Benefit ](/en/social-welfare/irish-
social-welfare-system/case-studies-checklists/case-study-jobseekers-benefit-
and-systematic-short-time-work/) .

You will continue to pay PRSI in the normal way. However, Jobseeker’s Benefit
is **not taxable** if you are a systematic short-time worker.

**Jobseeker's Benefit for systematic short-time workers**

**Number of days worked** |  **Effective days of unemployment** |  **Weekly payment for a single person** |  **Weekly payment for a couple with 1 child under 12**  
---|---|---|---  
1  |  4  |  €185.60  |  €345.60   
2  |  3  |  €139.20  |  €259.20   
3  |  2  |  €92.80  |  €172.80   
  
If you work 4 days you are no longer entitled to claim JB (because you must be
unemployed for 4 out of 7 days).

If you are a part-time worker and your days of work are reduced temporarily
you are not treated as a systematic short-time worker - you are treated as a
part-time worker (see below).

For example, if your working pattern is reduced from 3 days (Monday, Tuesday
and Wednesday) to 2 days (Monday and Tuesday) per week, you will be paid
Jobseeker's Benefit for 3 days once you satisfy all the conditions.

An employer may initially reduce your workdays on a temporary basis, but if
there is no prospect of returning to full-time work with that employer you
will be reassessed as a part-time worker.

###  2\. Part-time workers

Where a Jobseeker's Benefit recipient is working for part of a week, the
amount of JB they are paid is based on a 5-day week. This means that for each
day that a person is employed, 1/5th of the normal rate of Jobseeker's Benefit
is deducted from their payment.

If they get part-time work for 2 days, they will get 3/5ths of the normal
Jobseeker's Benefit for that week. If they get part-time work for 3 days, they
will get 2/5ths of the normal rate of Jobseeker’s Benefit for the week (see
table below).

You must still be unemployed for 4 days out of 7 to claim Jobseeker's Benefit.

Part-time workers must continue to look for full-time employment. Your
Jobseeker's Benefit **is** taxable if you are working part time. You must
claim Jobseeker's Benefit for at least 3 days in any week. If you get 4 days'
work, Jobseeker's Benefit is not paid at all.

####  Jobseeker's Benefit for part-time workers

**Days worked** |  **Effective days of unemployment** |  **Weekly payment for a single person** |  **Weekly payment for a couple with 1 child under 12**  
---|---|---|---  
0  |  6  |  €232  |  €432   
1  |  5  |  €185.60  |  €345.60   
2  |  4  |  €139.20  |  €259.20   
3  |  3  |  €92.80  |  €172.80   
  
If you work 4 days you are no longer entitled to claim JB (because you must be
unemployed for 4 out of 7 days).

**Note:** Jobseeker’s Benefit is paid for 234 days or 156 days depending on
how many PRSI contributions you have paid. You are considered to be unemployed
for 6 days out of the 7-day social welfare employment week. If you are fully
unemployed you would use up your entitlement to Jobseeker’s Benefit after
either 9 months (6 days of unemployment per week x 39 equals 234 days) or 6
months (6 days of unemployment per week x 26 equals 156 days).

However, if you are working part time your entitlement to Jobseeker’s Benefit
may last longer. For example, if you are entitled to 234 days JB (39 weeks)
and you are working for 2 days a week and unemployed for the remaining 4 days
you could continue to claim Jobseeker’s Benefit for 58.5 weeks. If you were
working for 3 days a week you would use 3 days of your total JB entitlement
and you could continue to claim JB for 78 weeks.

###  Job-sharing and week on/off

If you have been working full-time and then enter a job-sharing arrangement,
you are not eligible for Jobseeker's Benefit because you have voluntarily
opted to work fewer hours or days.

If you are working week on or off, your entitlement to Jobseeker's Benefit
will depend on whether you are available for work on the week off.

In these types of situations, you need to be careful to ensure that [ you have
a full PRSI record ](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/social-
insurance-prsi/part-time-work-and-social-insurance-prsi/) . Depending on your
precise working arrangements, you could end up with only 26 paid
contributions. However, if you are getting Jobseeker's Benefit, you will get a
PRSI credit for the week you are not working.

###  3\. Casual work or part-time work

You may get Jobseeker’s Benefit if you can only get part-time or casual work.
You must be unemployed for at least 4 days out of a period of 7 consecutive
days and continue to look for full-time employment.

For each day you are employed, 1/5th of the normal rate of Jobseeker's Benefit
is deducted from your weekly payment, provided that you are unemployed for at
least 4 days out of a period of 7 consecutive days. For example, if you get
casual work for 2 days, you can get 3/5ths of the normal Jobseeker's Benefit
for that week.

You must claim Jobseeker's Benefit for at least 3 days in any week. If you get
4 days' work, Jobseeker's Benefit is **not** paid at all.

Normally you cannot get Jobseeker's Benefit for a day on which you do casual
or part-time work, unless, it comes within the subsidiary work rules (see
below).

###  4\. Subsidiary employment

As a general rule, you will not get Jobseeker's Benefit for any day you are
employed or self-employed. However, it is possible to do some subsidiary work
and still get Jobseeker's Benefit for the day in question.

Subsidiary work is work that could have been done while you were in full-time
employment and outside your normal working hours. For example, you may work a
full-time job during the day and have a part-time job in the evening. The
part-time job is known as subsidiary or secondary employment if you were able
to do the part-time work without it affecting your full-time job for a period
of at least 6 months.

If you have subsidiary employment, you should always check with the Department
of Social Protection to see whether or not your Jobseeker's Benefit will be
affected.

If you have less than 117 paid PRSI contributions in the 3 years before
becoming unemployed, you may not earn more than €144 per week (€7,500 over 12
months) from subsidiary employment. There is no earnings limit if you have
more than 117 paid PRSI contributions.

If you are a farmer with other full-time employment, your farming will be your
subsidiary employment.

###  Sunday work and jobseeker's payments

**Sunday working is taken into account for Jobseeker's Benefit.** You must be
unemployed for 4 out of 7 consecutive days (including Sunday). If you work on
Sunday, you are considered to be employed for 1 day and 1/5th of your normal
rate of Jobseeker's Benefit will be deducted from your weekly payment.

Even though the social welfare employment week now takes Sunday into account,
you are not considered unemployed for 7 days. You are considered to be
unemployed for 6 days out of the 7-day social welfare employment week. This
means that for each week that you are fully unemployed, 6 days are deducted
from the days remaining on your Jobseeker's Benefit claim.

In the same way a person who works 2 days a week would have 4 days deducted
from the days remaining on their JB claim.

###  Public holidays

Your employer must pay you for the public holidays which you don’t work as
long as you have worked at least 40 hours in the 5 weeks immediately before
the week of the public holiday. You can read more about [ public holidays
](/en/employment/employment-rights-and-conditions/leave-and-holidays/public-
holidays/) .

If you work and get Jobseeker's Benefit, you get a daily rate of Jobseeker's
Benefit for the days that you don't work. You will not get Jobseeker’s Benefit
for the day you receive payment from your employer for a public holiday, but
you can continue to get Jobseeker’s Benefit for the other days you do not
work.

###  Temporary work

If you are getting Jobseeker's Benefit and are offered temporary work for at
least 4 days each week, your Jobseeker's Benefit will stop. If you are
unemployed for a second time within 26 weeks, your application for Jobseeker's
Benefit is not treated as a new claim.

**Example**  
---  
Susan is unemployed and has been getting Jobseeker's Benefit for 8 months. She
has 260 paid PRSI contributions, which means she can get Jobseeker's Benefit
for a maximum of 9 months. She was offered 2 months temporary work in a
factory. When her 2-months work ends, she is entitled to claim Jobseeker's
Benefit for another month.  
  
However, if you have used up your entitlement to Jobseeker's Benefit, you may
re-qualify by working and paying the appropriate PRSI contributions for at
least 13 weeks.

####  Short-term employment or training

The Department of Social Protection also operates a fast-tracking system for
customers who sign off for a short period of up to 12 weeks to take up work or
to go on a training course. This ensures that payment is re-instated without
delay. It is important that you inform your local office in advance that you
are taking up work or training.

##  Civil partner, spouse or cohabitant working and Jobseeker’s Benefit

Your Jobseeker's Benefit is not affected by your spouse’s, civil partner’s or
cohabitant's income. However, their income can affect whether you get an
increase in your Jobseeker's Benefit payment for him or her as a qualified
adult. The increase in your payment for an adult dependant is called an [
Increase for a Qualified Adult (IQA) ](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-
welfare-system/claiming-a-social-welfare-payment/claiming-an-increase-in-your-
social-welfare-payment-for-an-adult-dependant/) . If your adult dependant is
earning €100 or less, you will get the maximum IQA.

If he or she is earning between €100 and €310, you will get a reduced rate of
IQA. If your adult dependant is earning more than €310, you will not get an
IQA for your adult dependant.

###  How your spouse’s, civil partner’s or cohabitant's income is assessed

Your spouse’s, civil partner’s or cohabitant's income from all sources is
added together to find out if you qualify for an increase in your Jobseeker’s
Benefit.

###  Income from work

####  **Employment**

Your spouse’s, civil partner’s or cohabitant's average weekly income from
employment is assessed. The gross weekly income is assessed and no deductions
are allowed for tax, PRSI contributions or personal expenses.

If your spouse's, civil partner's or cohabitant's income is paid monthly, the
weekly average over the previous two months is calculated. If he or she is
paid weekly or fortnightly, the weekly average over the previous 6 weeks is
used. Note that your partner can get [ Working Family Payment (WFP)
](/en/social-welfare/families-and-children/working-family-payment/) while you
are getting Jobseeker's Benefit.

####  **Self-employment**

To calculate earnings from self-employment the income received in the last
completed tax year is divided by 52 to get the average weekly income. Earnings
are assessed as gross income less allowable expenses over 12 months.

Annual earnings from self-employment are divided by 52 to find your weekly
means from self-employment. Any ‘drawings’ you take from the business is not
an allowable expense.

###  Income from capital

Income from capital, for example, property, savings and investments, is
included in the mean test. Where capital is held jointly, half of the value is
assessed as belonging to your spouse, civil partner or cohabitant. You can
find out more about how [ capital is assessed in the means test. ](/en/social-
welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/means-test-for-social-welfare-
payments/how-to-assess-your-means-from-capital-for-social-welfare-payments/)

###  Income from other sources

Income from other sources includes rental income from the letting of property,
income from an occupational pension, foreign social welfare payments, income
from a trust fund, income under a deed of covenant and other cash income. It
is calculated on a weekly basis.

The following social welfare payments are not taken into account as income:

  * Disablement Benefit 
  * Occupational Injuries Death Benefit in respect of an Orphan 
  * Guardian's Payment (Contributory) 
  * Guardian's Payment (Non-Contributory) 
  * Child Benefit 
  * Domiciliary Care Allowance 
  * Supplementary Welfare Allowance
