##  Introduction

If you have difficulty making certain decisions on your own or think you may
soon have a difficulty, you can make a decision-making assistance agreement
and choose a person you trust to be your decision-making assistant.

This agreement allows you to choose which decisions you need help with. It
also gives your chosen person the legal recognition to help you to make those
decisions for yourself. Your decision-making assistant does not make decisions
for you. Instead, they help you to make your own decisions.

The decisions in your agreement can be about your personal welfare, property
and money matters.

For example, they may help you make decisions about your home or assist you in
making decisions about employment, training or social activities.

You can decide how long the agreement can last. It can be for a certain length
of time, or it can be ongoing.

Decision-making assistance agreements are one of the agreements that can be
made under the [ Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015
](/en/health/legal-matters-and-health/assisted-decision-making-act/) . If you
need someone to make decisions with you, you can make a [ co-decision making
agreement ](/en/health/legal-matters-and-health/co-decision-making-agreement/)
.

##  What can a decision-making assistant do?

The decision-making assistant can only help with decisions that are included
in your decision-making assistance agreement. This means they will be able to
access relevant information and records for you if you have included this task
in your agreement. This might involve getting records or information from your
bank, utility, or healthcare provider.

Your decision-making assistant will have the legal authority to:

  * Help you gather relevant information and explain it to you 
  * Help you understand and weigh up your options 
  * Support you by letting other people know about the decision that has been made 

Your decision-making assistant does not make a decision with or for you. They
support you to make your own decisions.

You can get more information about the role and responsibilities of the
decision-making assistant in the [ Code of Practice for the guidance of
decision-making assistants.
](https://decisionsupportservice.ie/resources/codes-practice/code-practice-
decision-making-assistants)

##  Who can be a decision-making assistant?

Your decision-making assistant must be an adult (aged 18 years and over). You
must know and trust the person you are choosing. You can have more than one
decision-making assistant in any agreement, and you can have multiple
agreements each dealing with different matters.

The person cannot be a decision-making assistant if they:

  * Have been convicted of an offence against you or your child 
  * Are financially insolvent or have been convicted of an offence involving fraud or dishonesty (unless the agreement is about personal welfare decisions) 
  * Are the owner or a registered provider of a designated care or mental health facility where you live or the employee of such a person (unless they are your relative) 
  * Were removed from the role of a decision-making assistant for you 

A decision-making assistantâ€™s appointment may also end if:

  * The assistant is your spouse, civil partner or cohabitant and your relationship ends 
  * They become ineligible to be a decision-making assistant for one of the above reasons. 

##  The role of the Decision Support Service

You must contact the [ Decision Support Service
](https://www.decisionsupportservice.ie/services/decision-support-
arrangements/decision-making-assistance-agreements) if you are making a
decision-making assistant agreement. They will review it and provide you and
your decision-making assistant with a certified copy of the agreement.

Your decision-making assistant does not have to send reports to the Decision
Support Service unless they have requested reports.

If there is a complaint made about your decision-making assistant, the
Decision Support Service may speak to you directly or can send [ somebody
called a general or special visitor
](https://decisionsupportservice.ie/services/decision-support-service-panels)
to talk to you and your decision-making assistant.

###  How to find out if someone is a decision-making assistant?

The Decision Support Service will be given a certified copy of the decision-
making assistance agreement.

The Decision Support Service can verify that a valid decision-making agreement
is in place.

##  How to make a decision-making assistance agreement

Your agreement must:

  * Be in writing 
  * Include details of the decisions that your decision-making assistant will help you with 
  * Include a statement by you to show you understand the agreement 
  * Be signed by you and your decision-making assistant 

Your decision-making assistant must confirm that they understand their duties
and will carry them out.

The easiest way to make an agreement is through the MyDSS portal using [ your
MyGovID ](/en/government-in-ireland/how-government-works/egovernment/mygovid/)
. MyDSS is run by the Decision Support Service. You can read a [ step-by-step
guide to using the portal
](https://decisionsupportservice.ie/services/decision-support-
arrangements/decision-making-assistance-agreement/making-decision-making-
assistance-agreement) .

##  Changing or ending your decision-making assistant agreement

You or your decision-making assistant can end the decision-making assistance
agreement at any time. You do not have to replace it with another type of
decision support arrangement. If you need more support for making decisions,
you can appoint a [ co-decision-maker ](/en/health/legal-matters-and-
health/co-decision-making-agreement/) or a [ decision-making representative
](/en/health/legal-matters-and-health/decision-making-representative-order/) .

A decision-making assistance agreement can be changed at any time. Any changes
to your decision-making assistance agreement must be agreed with your
decision-making assistant.

##  How much does a decision-making agreement cost?

There will be a fee of â‚¬15 to make the agreement with the Decision Support
Service or to make changes to the agreement.

Some people may not have to pay a fee, or will pay a lower fee. More details
about fees will be available soon.

##  Further information

You can get further information from the Decision Support Service.
