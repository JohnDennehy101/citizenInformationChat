#  Health services for people with disabilities

  * Introduction 
  * General health services 
  * Community care services 
  * Residential care 
  * Making a complaint about residential care 
  * Other supports for people with disabilities 

##  Introduction

If you have intellectual, physical and sensory disabilities or autism you can
get a range of services from the Health Service Executive (HSE), including:

  * Basic health services 
  * Assessment 
  * Rehabilitation 
  * Income maintenance 
  * Community care 
  * Residential care 

###  **Who provides health services for people with disabilities?**

You can get some services directly from the HSE. Many of the community,
residential and rehabilitative training services are provided by voluntary
organisations, which are funded by the HSE. The level of service varies
considerably throughout the country.

Your local HSE services area will have a Disability Services Manager to co-
ordinate the delivery of services to people with disabilities.

If you have a child with a disability, you can read about [ caring for a child
with a disability in Ireland.
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/health/health-services/children-s-
health/caring-for-a-child-with-a-disability/)

##  General health services

If you have a disability, you are entitled to the same general health services
as everyone else. These services may include:

  * [ Medical cards ](/en/health/medical-cards-and-gp-visit-cards/medical-card/)
  * [ Prescribed drugs, medicines, medical aids and appliances ](/en/health/drugs-and-medicines/prescribed-drugs-and-medicines/)
  * [ Hospital services ](/en/health/health-services/gp-and-hospital-services/hospital-services-introduction/)
  * [ Dental services ](/en/health/health-services/dental-aural-and-optical-services/dental-services/) , [ optical services ](/en/health/health-services/dental-aural-and-optical-services/sight-tests-and-eye-health/) and [ aural services ](/en/health/health-services/dental-aural-and-optical-services/hearing-and-ear-health/) [ http://www.hiqa.ie ](http://www.hiqa.ie)

##  Community care services

If you have a disability, you are entitled to get a range of [ community care
services ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/health/health-services/care-
in-your-community/community-care-services/) . In many cases, you will get
priority access to these services.

##  Residential care

If you have a disability and are unable to live at home, you may get
residential services directly from the HSE or, by voluntary organisations that
are funded by the HSE.

A residential service is somewhere you can live most or all of the time. You
may have to pay [ Long-Stay Contributions for Residential Support Services
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/health/health-services/health-
services-for-people-with-disabilities/long-stay-contributions/) .

##  Making a complaint about residential care

If you want to make a complaint about the care and treatment of someone in
residential care (provided that the care is run by or funded by the HSE), you
can contact the ‘ [ Confidential Recipient ](http://www.hse.ie/confidential/)
’.

The confidential recipient is an independent person who represents people with
disabilities when a complaint is made. They will:

  * Listen to your concerns 
  * Keep your identity anonymous, if you prefer 
  * Support you and send your concern to the right place 
  * Make sure your concern is reviewed within 15 working days 

You can read more about [ how to make a complaint and contact the confidential
recipient ](https://www2.hse.ie/complaints-feedback/report-a-concern-about-a-
vulnerable-adult/) on the HSE’s website.

Alternatively, you can give feedback using the HSE’s ‘ [ Your service your
say’ ](https://www2.hse.ie/complaints-feedback/) facility.

###  **Regulation of residential care for people with disabilities**

The [ Health Information and Quality Authority
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/health/health-services/health-
services-for-people-with-disabilities/regulation-residential-care-people-with-
disabilities/) (HIQA) regulates all residential services for children and
adults with disabilities, whether the service is provided by the HSE, a
voluntary group or private organisation.

Read more about the [ regulation of residential services for people with
disabilities ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/health/health-
services/health-services-for-people-with-disabilities/regulation-residential-
care-people-with-disabilities/) .

##  Other supports for people with disabilities

You can read the [ Guide to entitlements for people with disabilities
](https://www.citizensinformationboard.ie/downloads/guides/guide_to_entitlements_for_people_with_disabilities_2022.pdf)
(pdf) for information on the range of supports available to people with
disabilities, in health and other areas.
