##  Maximum working hours

The maximum number of hours you can work in an average working week is 48
hours. A working week can be more than 48 hours, it is the average that is
important. If you are **under 18** , there are different rules (see below).

The 48 hours of work **do not** include time spent on annual leave, sick
leave, maternity leave, adoptive leave, parental leave, carer's leave or force
majeure leave.

There are also special conditions for employees who work on Sundays – see
'Sunday working and overtime' below.

For most employees, the law on working time and breaks is set out in the [
Organisation of Working Time Act 1997
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1997/en/act/pub/0020/index.html) \- see 'the
laws on work hours' below.

###  Exceptions to the 48-hour work week

The law on working time and rest periods does not apply to all employees. For
example, it does not apply to:

  * The Gardaí 
  * Defence forces 
  * Employees who control their own working hours 
  * Family employees on farms or in private homes 
  * Employees in [ certain categories of civil protection services ](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1998/en/si/0052.html)

You can read more about [ night workers ](/en/employment/employment-rights-
and-conditions/hours-of-work/night-work/) and [ minimum breaks and rest
periods ](/en/employment/employment-rights-and-conditions/hours-of-work/work-
breaks-and-rest-periods/) .

###  Working hours and young workers

If you are **under 18** , there are different maximum working hours, breaks
and rules on night work. You can read more about [ young people’s working
hours ](/en/employment/starting-work-and-changing-job/young-people-at-
work/working-hours-rest-breaks-young-people/) .

##  How to work out your average working hours

You get your average working hours by calculating the number of hours you work
each week and then averaging these hours over a set period (see table below).

The set period (or _reference period_ ) depends on the type of work you do and
any special agreements you have with your employer.

Different set periods for certain workers  **Set period** |  **Set period applies to:**  
---|---  
4 months  |  Most employees   
6 months  |  Employees working in:  • The security industry   
• Hospitals  
• Prisons  
• Gas and electricity  
• Airport and docks  
• Agriculture  
• Businesses which have ‘peak periods’ at certain times of the year (such as
tourism)  
12 months  |  Employees who have agreed to this with their employer (this must be approved by the Labour Court).   
  
###  Example

You have a standard working week of 40 hours (8 hours a day). You also do 12
hours of overtime a week for the first 10 weeks of your 4 month (17 weeks)
reference period. Follow these steps to calculate your average working hours:

  1. 17 weeks of 40 hours and 10 weeks of 12 hours overtime (17 x 40) + (10 x 12) = 800 (680+120) 
  2. 800 hours should be divided by 17 (the number of weeks in the reference period) 800 ÷ 17= 47.06 

So you would have worked an average of 47.06 hours per week. This would be
within the working time limits of 48 hours.

##  Information about your working hours

Usually, you can find your working hours and work patterns in your contract of
employment. You may also find your hours in an [ Employment Regulation Order
or Registered Employment Agreement ](/en/employment/employment-rights-and-
conditions/industrial-relations-and-trade-unions/employment-agreements-and-
orders/) .

If your hours of work change from week-to-week, your employer must:

  * Tell you the starting and finishing times at least 24 hours before your first day of work. 
  * Give you at least 24 hours’ notice of your working hours for each day you have to work (particularly if you do not work every day). For example, they should put up a notice in an obvious place on a day that you are working. 
  * Give you 24 hours’ notice if you have to work additional hours. However, they can ask you to work at less than 24 hours’ notice in unexpected cases, for example when they need you to cover for another employee who is off sick. 

The work must take place within the reference hours and days you were told. If
you are not given the minimum 24 hours’ notice, you can refuse to work without
any negative effects.

This is set out in [ Section 17 of the Act
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1997/en/act/pub/0020/sec0017.html#sec17) ,
which was updated by [ Section 13 of the European Union (Transparent and
Predictable Working Conditions) Regulations 2022
](https://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2022/si/686/made/en/print) .

##  What if I work more hours than set out in my contract?

If you work on a low-hour contract of employment and you regularly work more
hours than what your contract says, you can ask your employer to change the
contract terms.

You are entitled to be put in a _band of hours_ (also called _banded weekly
hours_ ). This means your contract will better reflect the number of hours you
have worked over a 12-month period.

###  Applying to be put on banded weekly hours

If you want to be put on banded hours, you must apply to your employer in
writing.

Your employer will decide which band of weekly hours applies to you, based on
the average number of hours you worked each week during the past 12 months –
see the table below.

Your employer must place you on a band of weekly hours **within 4 weeks** of
the date you made the request. Once you are placed on banded hours, you are
entitled to work an average of those hours for the next 12 months.

Band of hours based on your average hours worked  **Band** |  **Average number of hours worked each week**  
---|---  
A  |  3 hours or more  |  less than 6 hours   
B  |  6 hours or more  |  less than 11 hours   
C  |  11 hours or more  |  less than 16 hours   
D  |  16 hours or more  |  less than 21 hours   
E  |  21 hours or more  |  less than 26 hours   
F  |  26 hours or more  |  less than 31 hours   
G  |  31 hours or more  |  less than 36 hours   
H  |  36 hours and over  |  N/A   
  
###  If your employer refuses to put you on banded weekly hours

In some cases, your employer can refuse to put you on banded hours. For
example:

  * If there was no evidence to support your request 
  * If there were significant _adverse_ (negative) changes to the business during the 12-month reference period 
  * If there was a temporary situation that is now over 
  * If your hours are set out in a collective agreement 

If your request is refused and you are not satisfied with your employer’s
explanation, you can make a complaint to the Workplace Relations Commission
(WRC). See ‘How to make a complaint’ below.

##  Sunday working and overtime

###  Working on Sundays

If you work on Sundays, you are entitled to a benefit, such as extra pay. This
is usually set out in your contract of employment.

If you and your employer have not made an agreement about extra pay, then your
employer must give you one (or more) of the following:

  * A reasonable allowance 
  * A reasonable pay increase 
  * Reasonable paid time off work 

What is ‘reasonable’ depends on the situation. Your employer should discuss
this with you and your trade union (if you have one).

You can read more in the Workplace Relations Commission’s [ Code of Practice
for Sunday working in the Retail Trade
](https://www.workplacerelations.ie/en/what_you_should_know/codes_practice/cop9/)
.

###  Overtime

_Overtime_ means work done outside your normal working hours.

There is no legal right to pay for working extra hours and there is no
statutory levels of overtime pay. However, many employers pay employees higher
rates of pay for overtime.

You should check your [ contract of employment ](/en/employment/employment-
rights-and-conditions/contracts-of-employment/contract-of-employment/) for
confirmation on:

  * Whether you must work overtime 
  * The rates of pay for overtime (if any) 

Certain sectors of employment have higher rates of pay for overtime than for
normal hours. This is covered by [ Employment Regulation Orders and Registered
Employment Agreements ](/en/employment/employment-rights-and-
conditions/industrial-relations-and-trade-unions/employment-agreements-and-
orders/) .

##  Does travelling for work count towards my working time?

Most employees cannot include the time spent travelling to and from work in
their working hours. This is set out in [ Section 8
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2000/act/5/section/8/enacted/en/html) of
the National Minimum Wage Act 2000.

However, there may be different rules for workers with no fixed place of work
(where you do not work in the same place every day).

##  How to make a complaint

If you have a complaint about your working week, you should speak to your
employer.

If you cannot resolve the problem with your employer, you can make a complaint
to the Workplace Relations Commission using the [ online complaint form
](https://www.workplacerelations.ie/en/Complaints_Disputes/Refer_a_Dispute_Make_a_Complaint/)
.

You should make your complaint **within 6 months** of the dispute or complaint
taking place. This time limit may be extended for a further 6 months, but only
if you had a _reasonable cause_ for not bringing the complaint within the
first 6 months.

Read more about [ how to make a complaint ](/en/employment/enforcement-and-
redress/adjudication-employment-rights-disputes-and-complaints/) , including
details of the WRC adjudication process.

Find more information on working hours and your employment rights from the
WRC’s [ Information and Customer Service
](https://www.workplacerelations.ie/en/contact_us/contact-details/) .

##  The laws on work hours

For most employees, the law on working time and breaks is set out in the [
Organisation of Working Time Act 1997
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1997/en/act/pub/0020/index.html) . However,
there are special regulations for:

  * Trainee doctors ( [ SI 494/2004 ](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2004/en/si/0494.html) ) 
  * Employees working in mobile road transport activities ( [ SI 36/2012 ](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2012/si/36/made/en/print) ) 
  * Employees working at sea ( [ SI 245/2014 ](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2014/si/245/made/en/print) ) 

Your employer must keep a [ detailed record of your working hours
](/en/employment/employment-rights-and-conditions/hours-of-work/employment-
working-time-records/) . This is set out in the [ Organisation of Working Time
(Records) (Prescribed Form and Exemptions) Regulations 2001
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2001/en/si/0473.html) .
