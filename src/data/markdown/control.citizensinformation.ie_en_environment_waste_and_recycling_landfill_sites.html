##  What is a landfill site?

A landfill site is a place where general rubbish is disposed of when it is not
[ recycled ](/en/environment/waste-and-recycling/recycling-household-waste/)
or [ composted ](/en/environment/waste-and-recycling/composting-domestic-
waste/) . Landfill sites are designed to protect the environment by storing
the waste material separate from the surrounding soil, groundwater and air.
However, this waste does not break down or decompose.

Before you send anything to landfill you should consider all other waste
disposal options, such as [ reducing ](/en/environment/waste-and-
recycling/reducing-waste/) , re-using and [ recycling ](/en/environment/waste-
and-recycling/recycling-household-waste/) .

Landfill sites have more protection for the environment and for local people
than traditional ‘dumps’. The site is managed carefully to control problems
such as smell, litter or vermin.

Read more about [ the role the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has with
waste ](https://www.epa.ie/our-services/licensing/waste/) .

##  What can I dispose of at a landfill site?

Landfill sites usually accept most household rubbish but you should contact
your local landfill site to ask if it will accept your items. [ Your local
authority ](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/942f74-local-authorities/) will
have details of landfill sites in your area.

##  What are the fees for using a landfill site?

When you send waste to a landfill, there are charges of:

  * A government levy of €85 per tonne 
  * A gate fee is charged by the owner – check prices with the local authority or private company that runs the site 

[ From 1 September 2023 ](https://www.gov.ie/en/press-
release/75262-introduction-of-new-environment-levies-will-incentivise-
recycling-and-help-ireland-meet-our-eu-waste-targets/) , the waste recovery
levy is €10 per tonne (or 1,000kg) when using a landfill site. The existing
government levy has also increased by €10, to €85 per tonne. Check with your
waste company to see if there is an increase in the cost of collecting your
bins.

##  Waste licences

A waste licence sets out what types of waste a site can take and how it must
be monitored. The EPA can stop a landfill site from taking certain kinds of
waste if the waste licence application does not show how environmental
pollution will be prevented.

You can find submitted applications for landfill sites and waste licences on
the [ EPA website ](http://www.epa.ie/terminalfour/waste/index.jsp) .

You can read about [ the process of getting a waste licence
](https://www.epa.ie/our-services/licensing/waste/waste-licensing/waste-
licence-process-explained/) , [ how to apply for a waste licence
](https://www.epa.ie/our-services/licensing/waste/waste-licensing/how-to-
apply-for-a-waste-licence/) , and [ guidelines for licence applications
](https://www.epa.ie/our-services/licensing/waste/waste-licensing/how-to-
apply-for-a-waste-licence/waste-licence-application-guidance/) on the EPA
website.

###  **Making a submission about a** licence **application**

After the EPA gets a licence application, anyone can submit comments or
observations about it for free. You must submit your comments before the EPA
decides on whether to grant the licence. [ Find out how to make a submission
on the EPA website. ](https://www.epa.ie/our-services/licensing/waste/waste-
licensing/submissions/)

###  **Objecting to a waste** licence

After the EPA gives notice of its proposed decision on a licence application,
anyone can [ make an objection ](http://www.epa.ie/enforcement/report/) to it
online or in writing. You must make your objection within 30 days and pay a
fee (see the table below). You can ask for an oral hearing of your objection
to a waste licence decision. Visit the EPA website for information on [ how to
object to a waste licence ](https://www.epa.ie/our-
services/licensing/waste/waste-licensing/objections/) .

###  **How much does objecting to a waste** licence **cost?**

**Cost of objecting to a waste licence** |  **Fee**  
---|---  
Applicant/licensee  
objection  |  €500   
Third-party objection  |  €200   
Oral hearing  |  €100
