##  Introduction

Most non-EEA nationals must have an employment permit to work in Ireland. If
you have moved to Ireland to join a family member, or you have been granted
residence in Ireland by the Minister for Justice, you may be allowed to [ work
without an employment permit ](/en/moving-country/working-in-ireland/migrant-
workers/coming-to-work-in-ireland/) .

Employment permits are processed by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and
Employment (DETE). Usually, you apply for the employment permit when you have
been offered a job. You must get your employment permit before you come to
Ireland in most cases. You can apply for the employment permit yourself, or
your employer can apply for you.

There are different types of employment permits administered by DETE and a
special [ Hosting Agreement for academic researchers
](https://www.irishimmigration.ie/coming-to-work-in-ireland/what-are-my-work-
visa-options/applying-for-a-long-stay-employment-visa/scientific-researcher/)
administered by the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research,
Innovation and Science. The most common employment permits are the [ General
Employment Permit ](/en/moving-country/working-in-ireland/employment-
permits/work-permits/) and the [ Critical Skills Employment Permit
](/en/moving-country/working-in-ireland/employment-permits/green-card-
permits/) .

The employment permits scheme is governed by the [ Employment Permits Acts
](http://www.lawreform.ie/_fileupload/RevisedActs/WithAnnotations/HTML/en_act_2006_0016.htm)
. On 2 September 2024, the Employment Permits Act 2024 comes into effect and
introduces some changes to employment permits law in Ireland.

###  Which employment permit should I apply for?

If you are not sure which permit to apply for, you can use [ DETE’s
application guide ](https://epos.enterprise.gov.ie/#/app/findFormAssistant) .

##  Critical Skills Employment Permit

You can apply for a [ Critical Skills Employment Permit (CSEP)
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/moving-country/working-in-
ireland/employment-permits/green-card-permits/) if you are offered a job in a
profession that is either:

  * Paying at least €38,000 per year and on the [ Critical Skills Occupation List ](https://enterprise.gov.ie/en/What-We-Do/Workplace-and-Skills/Employment-Permits/Employment-Permit-Eligibility/Highly-Skilled-Eligible-Occupations-List/)
  * Paying €64,000 per year and is not on the [ list of ineligible occupations ](https://enterprise.gov.ie/en/What-We-Do/Workplace-and-Skills/Employment-Permits/Employment-Permit-Eligibility/Ineligible-Categories-of-Employment/)

The Critical Skills Employment Permit is for skilled workers who are qualified
in professions where there is a shortage of skills in Ireland. You must have a
relevant third-level qualification, but for some types of job, you may be
eligible with a lesser qualification or if you have the required practical
experience to do the job.Your prospective employer must offer you at least a
2-year employment contract.

Your family can join you in Ireland immediately. Your spouse or partner can
get a [ Stamp 1G Irish Residence Permit
](https://www.irishimmigration.ie/coming-to-join-family-in-ireland/joining-an-
eea-or-swiss-national/de-facto-partner-of-a-critical-skills-employment-permit-
holder-csep-or-hosting-agreement-holder-ha/) , which allows them to work
without an employment permit. After 21 months of working on a Critical Skills
EP in Ireland, you can apply for a Stamp 4 Irish Residence Permit, which
allows you to work without an employment permit.

####  **Can I change employer?**

From 2 September 2024, a CSEP permit holder can change to another employer
after **9 months** have passed since you started your first employment. You
don’t have to apply for a new permit, but you have to move within the
profession.

You cannot start work with your new employer until the employment permit has
been reissued. You must start work with your new employer within **1 month**
of the new permit being issued.

####  **Can I get promoted?**

From 2 September 2024, the Employment Permits Act 2024 allows for promotion
and internal transfer in the same company where you are using the same skills.

##  General Employment Permit

You can apply for a [ General Employment Permit ](/en/moving-country/working-
in-ireland/employment-permits/work-permits/) if you are offered a job that is:

  * Paying at least €34,000 per year (from 17 January 2024) - see below for exceptions 
  * Not in a profession on the [ list of ineligible occupations ](https://enterprise.gov.ie/en/What-We-Do/Workplace-and-Skills/Employment-Permits/Employment-Permit-Eligibility/Ineligible-Categories-of-Employment/)
  * For a business where at least half the workers are from the EEA. This is called the [ 50:50 rule ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/moving-country/working-in-ireland/employment-permits/work-permits#l63301) . 

The company or business must be already trading in Ireland and registered with
the Companies Register Office and Revenue.

Your family can join you in Ireland after your first year of employment. Your
spouse or partner can get a [ Stamp 1G Irish Residence Permit
](https://www.irishimmigration.ie/coming-to-join-family-in-ireland/joining-an-
eea-or-swiss-national/de-facto-partner-of-a-critical-skills-employment-permit-
holder-csep-or-hosting-agreement-holder-ha/) , which allows them to work
without an employment permit. All other dependants must [ apply for an
employment permit ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/moving-
country/working-in-ireland/employment-permits/spousal-work-permit-scheme/) to
work in Ireland. Find out more about [ employment permits and family members
](/en/moving-country/working-in-ireland/employment-permits/spousal-work-
permit-scheme/) .

If you get a General Employment Permit, you can apply for a visa to come to
Ireland (if you [ need a visa to enter Ireland ](/en/moving-country/visas-for-
ireland/visa-requirements-for-entering-ireland/) ). After 57 months you can
apply for a Stamp 4 Irish Residence Permit, which allows you to work without
an employment permit. If you are a doctor working for the HSE or a HSE funded
agency and have a Stamp 1H, you can get a Stamp 4 after 21 months.

####  **Can I change employers?**

From 2 September 2024, GEP permit holders can change to another employer after
**9 months** have passed since you started your first employment. You don’t
have to apply for a new permit, but you have to move within the profession.
For example, a meat processing operative can move to another meat processing
role.

####  **Can I get promoted?**

From 2 September 2024, the Employment Permits Act 2024 allows for promotion
and internal transfer in the same company where you are using the same skills.

###  Labour Market Needs Test

The employer must have tried to fill the post with an Irish or EEA citizen.
They must show that they have advertised the job with EURES and the Department
of Social Protection (DSP) for at least 28 days. Employers must also advertise
the job in a national newspaper for at least 3 days, and in a local paper or
online recruitment agency (that is not a DSP or EURES website) for 3 days.
From 2 September 2024, the publication of adverts can be online (instead of
print), for example, on a newspaper’s website.

##  Dependant, Partner, Spouse Employment Permit

A Dependant, Partner, Spouse Employment Permit is for the dependants of people
on a Critical Skills Employment Permit or a researcher under a Hosting
Agreement. The spouse or de-facto partner of a person on a Critical Skills
Employment Permit or a Hosting Agreement does not need this permit as they do
not need an employment permit to work in Ireland. However, any other
dependants will need an employment permit and can apply for a Dependant,
Partner, Spouse Employment Permit.
