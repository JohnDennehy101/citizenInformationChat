parts of Dublin on 2 tramlines running through the city centre. These
tramlines are:

  * The Green Line: connecting Bride’s Glen (on the south side of the city) to Broombridge (on the north side) 
  * The Red Line: connecting Saggart and Tallaght (on the southwestern side of Dublin) to The Point in Dublin Docklands

](https://www.transportforireland.ie/plan-a-journey/) to link your Dublin Bus
and Dart journeys to the Luas. There is a [ list of frequently asked questions

###

##  How Luas works

###  Operating hours and frequency

Operating hours vary by stop and direction of service. You can view [ Luas
operating hours ](https://www.luas.ie/operating-hours.html) and [ Luas
frequency ](https://luas.ie/times/) on luas.ie.

There are electronic displays telling you the time of the next tram at every
Luas stop. In addition, there are electronic displays and announcements
informing passengers of the next stop on board every tram.

Special services operate during Christmas, New Year and on other occasions.

###

##  Luas services for passengers with disabilities

All Luas trams and stops are wheelchair-accessible and there are designated
parking spaces for people with disabilities. Each tram makes audio
announcements and has electronic displays so you can tell where you are on
your journey. You may bring your [ guide dog ](/en/travel-and-
recreation/transport-and-disability/mobility-training-for-people-with-a-
visual-impairment/) on board Luas trams. You can read more about [ travelling
on public transport with a disability or reduced mobility ](/en/travel-and-
recreation/public-transport/travelling-publictransport-with-disability/) .

##  Tickets

Ticket vending machines are located at every Luas stop. You must have a valid
ticket before boarding the tram. You can use your [ Leap Card
](https://www.leapcard.ie/Home/index.html) , which you can top it up at the
vending machines.

Your ticket must be valid in all Luas zones you travel in. If you are using a
Leap card, you must validate it at the beginning and end of your journey using
the validator on the platform. Read the [ Leap Card FAQS
](https://about.leapcard.ie/faqs) for more information.

The cost of your ticket will depend on the number of zones your journey
covers. You can calculate the cost of your Luas journey in advance using the
online [ fare calculator ](https://www.luas.ie/fare-calculator.php) .

You can see a [ guide to the different types of Luas tickets
](https://www.luas.ie/ticket-types.html) and view a [ summary list of fares
(pdf) ](https://luas.ie/assets/files/Luas Summary Fares Sheet_Valid from Fri
1st Dec 2017_4.pdf) on luas.ie. If you are an adult, you must carry a Luas or
Dublin Bus photo identity card to use certain types of ticket.

the pass is valid. They may look for supporting documentation and check with
the Department of Social Protection to ensure the pass is being used by the
correct person.

](https://luas.ie/faq/) . Children aged 5–15 pay the child fare.

you do not have a Luas ticket valid for travel on the day you park at a Luas
stop, you will have to pay an additional charge when you leave the car park.
