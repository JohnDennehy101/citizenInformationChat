##  What is unfair dismissal?

If you are dismissed from work, the dismissal is automatically considered to
be ‘unfair’ if you are dismissed for:

  * Membership (or proposed membership) of a trade union, or for engaging in trade union activities 
  * Religious or political opinions 
  * Legal proceedings against an employer where you are a party or a witness 
  * Race, colour, sexual orientation, age, or membership of the Traveller community 
  * Pregnancy, giving birth, breastfeeding, or any other matters connected with pregnancy or birth (such as attending antenatal classes) 
  * Availing of rights under legislation to maternity leave, adoptive leave, paternity leave, carer’s leave, parent’s leave, parental leave or force majeure leave 
  * Unfair selection for redundancy 
  * Making a protected disclosure (that is, where you raise concerns about possible wrongdoing at work) under the Protected Disclosures Act 2014 

Unfair dismissal happens where:

  * Your employer ends your contract of employment, with or without notice 
  * You end your contract of employment, with or without notice, due to the conduct of your employer. This is known as constructive dismissal. 

###  What does not count as ‘unfair’ dismissal?

Your dismissal from work is not ‘unfair’ if it results from:

  * Your capability, competence or qualifications for the job 
  * Your conduct (behaviour) 
  * You being unable to work (or continue to work) in the position you held without breaking the law (for example, if your job involves driving and you are then legally disqualified from driving) 
  * Your redundancy (read more about redundancy below) 

In general, [ redundancy ](/en/employment/unemployment-and-
redundancy/redundancy/) is a fair reason for dismissal. However, you may have
grounds (reasons) for complaint if you were [ unfairly selected for redundancy
](/en/employment/unemployment-and-redundancy/redundancy/redundancy-
procedures/) , or if you feel there was no genuine need for redundancy.

Unless your employer can prove there was a [ genuine redundancy situation
](/en/employment/unemployment-and-redundancy/redundancy/what-is-redundancy/)
and that they followed [ fair procedures ](/en/employment/unemployment-and-
redundancy/redundancy/redundancy-procedures/) , your dismissal may be
considered ‘unfair’.

If you make a claim for unfair dismissal, you cannot also claim redundancy.

##  Can I bring a claim for unfair dismissal?

Claims for unfair dismissal are handled by the Workplace Relations Commission.
You can bring a claim for unfair dismissal if you meet the following
requirements:

###  Time limits

You must complain about an unfair dismissal **within 6 months** of the
dismissal happening. Under the Unfair Dismissals Acts, the ‘date of your
dismissal’ is the date your _notice_ expires.

Read about the [ statutory minimum period of notice ](/en/employment/starting-
work-and-changing-job/changing-job/giving-notice/) , and check if your
contract of employment gives a longer period of notice.

The 6-month time limit may be extended for a further 6 months, but only if you
have a ‘reasonable cause’ for the delay.

###  Length of service

Usually, you must have at least 12 months’ continuous service with your
employer before you can bring a claim for unfair dismissal.

####  Exceptions to the ‘length of service’ rule

If you have worked for your employer for less than 12 months, you may still
bring a claim for unfair dismissal if you were dismissed for:

  * Trade union membership or activity 
  * Pregnancy, giving birth, breastfeeding or any matters connected with pregnancy or birth 
  * Availing of rights to maternity leave, adoptive leave, paternity leave, parental leave, carer’s leave, parent's leave, force majeure leave, or the national minimum wage 
  * Making a [ protected disclosure ](/en/employment/enforcement-and-redress/protection-for-whistleblowers/)

If you have less than one year’s service and your employer has not followed [
fair procedures ](/en/government-in-ireland/irish-constitution-1/constitution-
fundamental-rights/) when dismissing you, you may be able to make a claim
under Section 20(1) of the Industrial Relations Act 1969. However, any
recommendation from the Court is not legally binding on the employer.

####  Dismissal based on discrimination

Dismissal based on any of the following 9 grounds for discrimination is
illegal:

  * Gender 
  * Civil status 
  * Family status 
  * Age 
  * Disability 
  * Religious belief 
  * Race 
  * Sexual orientation 
  * Membership of the Traveller community 

For example, if you have been employed for less than a year, you may not be
able to bring a claim under the unfair dismissals legislation. But, you may be
able make a complaint of ‘discriminatory dismissal’. Read about [ handling
disputes about discrimination ](/en/employment/enforcement-and-
redress/disputes-about-equality-and-discrimination/) .

###  Employment status

To be considered an ‘employee’, you must work for an employer under a
‘contract **of** service’. This is different from a ‘contract **for**
services’, where a contractor or self-employed worker performs a service in
return for payment. Read more about [ understanding your employment status
](/en/employment/types-of-employment/understanding-your-employment-status/) .

If you work for an agency, you can generally bring a claim under the Unfair
Dismissals Acts against the employer who hired you from the agency. Read about
[ agency employees ](/en/employment/types-of-employment/agency-workers/) .

###  The fact of dismissal

You must have been dismissed in order to bring a claim for unfair dismissal.
The only exception is in cases of [ constructive dismissal
](/en/employment/unemployment-and-redundancy/dismissal/constructive-
dismissal/) , where you claim your employer’s actions towards you forced you
to resign from the job.

If your employer disputes that a dismissal actually took place, you must prove
that it did. Once you prove the dismissal happened, your claim for unfair
dismissal can continue to the WRC.

##  Who cannot bring a claim for unfair dismissal?

You cannot bring a claim for unfair dismissal if you are:

(a) An employee under 16, or an employee who has reached the [ normal
retirement age of 65 ](/en/employment/retirement/older-people-and-
working/retirement-age/) , or who is not covered by the Redundancy Payments
Acts because of your age

(b) Working for a close relative in a private house or farm, where you both
also live in the same house or farm

(c) A member of the Defence Forces

(d) A member of the Garda Síochána

(e) Taking part in full-time training or an apprenticeship

(f) An officer of education and training boards, a county or city manager, or
the chief executive of the HSE

(g) Employed under a [ fixed-term/specified-purpose contract
](/en/employment/employment-rights-and-conditions/contracts-of-
employment/rights-of-fixed-term-workers/) – this contract will be in writing,
signed by you and your employer, and will state the Unfair Dismissal Acts do
not apply if you are only dismissed because the fixed-term contract has ended

(h) An employee who works outside the State (unless, while the contract is in
force, you are resident or domiciled in the State or are domiciled in the
State and your employer is resident in the State)

(i) A statutory apprentice who is dismissed within 6 months after beginning
your apprenticeship, or within one month of completing the apprenticeship

(j) An employee on probation or undergoing training for up to a year at the
beginning of employment, where the duration of your probation or training is
specified in the written contract of employment

(k) An employee who is dismissed while training to qualify or register as a
nurse or other specified para-medical employment

###  Exceptions

If points (b), (e), (i), (j) or (k) apply to you, you can still claim for
unfair dismissal if the dismissal results from:

  * Pregnancy, giving birth or breastfeeding 
  * Availing of rights under the Maternity Protection Acts 1994 and 2004 
  * Availing of rights to adoptive leave or additional adoptive leave, paternity leave, parental leave, parent's leave, force majeure leave or carer’s leave 

If points (a) or (d) apply to you, you can still claim for unfair dismissal if
you are dismissed for taking parental leave, force majeure leave or carer’s
leave.

If points (d) or (e) apply to you, you can still claim for unfair dismissal if
you are dismissed for making a [ protected disclosure
](/en/employment/enforcement-and-redress/protection-for-whistleblowers/) .

**Note:** You cannot claim for unfair dismissal if your employer told you in
writing when you started work that your employment will end when another
employee returns from maternity leave, adoptive leave, paternity leave or
carer’s leave.

##  How to bring a claim for unfair dismissal

If you meet certain conditions (see ‘Can I bring a claim for unfair
dismissal?’ above), you can bring a claim for unfair dismissal against your
employer.

If your employer accepts they dismissed you, they must show that there were [
fair grounds for the dismissal ](/en/employment/unemployment-and-
redundancy/dismissal/fair-grounds-for-dismissal/) . A dismissal is
automatically presumed to be unfair unless your employer can show substantial
grounds (reasons) to justify it. This does not apply in cases of [
constructive dismissal ](/en/employment/unemployment-and-
redundancy/dismissal/constructive-dismissal/) .

Ask your employer for a written statement of the reasons for your dismissal.
Your employer should give you the statement **within 14 days** of your
request. Once you get this written statement, you can bring your complaint to
the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC).

###  How to make a claim for unfair dismissal

Bring a claim for unfair dismissal using the WRC’s [ online complaint form
](https://www.workplacerelations.ie/en/complaints_disputes/refer_a_dispute_make_a_complaint/)
.

You must make your complaint **within 6 months** of the dismissal happening
(that is 6 months from the date [ your notice ](/en/employment/starting-work-
and-changing-job/changing-job/giving-notice/) ends). The time limit may be
extended for a further 6 months, but only if you have a ‘reasonable cause’ for
the delay.

Read more about [ how to make a complaint ](/en/employment/enforcement-and-
redress/adjudication-employment-rights-disputes-and-complaints/) , including
details of the WRC adjudication process.

###  What happens next?

At the WRC, an adjudication officer (also called an _adjudicator_ ) will
arrange a hearing to decide whether your dismissal was fair.

The adjudicator can make witnesses attend the hearing and give evidence in
your case.

If the adjudicator finds you have been unfairly dismissed, you may either:

  * Get your job back 
  * Get compensation for the loss of earnings caused by the dismissal – see ‘If your claim is successful’ below 

If you are unhappy with the adjudicator’s decision, you can [ appeal it to the
Labour Court ](/en/employment/enforcement-and-redress/employment-appeals/) .

##  If your claim is successful

If your claim for unfair dismissal is successful, the WRC (or the Labour
Court) may award you either _reinstatement_ , _re-engagement_ or
_compensation_ .

###  Reinstatement

Reinstatement means you are treated as if you had never been dismissed.

If you are reinstated, you have a right to repayment for earnings lost between
the date of the dismissal and the date of the hearing. You also have a right
to any favourable changes in the terms of employment during that period, such
as a pay rise.

###  Re-engagement

Re-engagement means you get your job back from a particular date, such as the
date of the WRC decision. This means you do not have a right to compensation
for any loss of earnings.

Re-engagement is used when the adjudicator feels the employee contributed to
the dismissal, even though the actual dismissal was unfair.

###  Compensation

Compensation is where you get payment for your financial loss (you do not get
your job back). It is the most common outcome in unfair dismissal cases.

Generally, the maximum compensation is 2 years’ pay. But, if you were
dismissed for making a [ protected disclosure ](/en/employment/enforcement-
and-redress/protection-for-whistleblowers/) , the maximum is 5 years’ pay. You
cannot claim compensation for injury to your feelings or stress caused by the
dismissal.

When awarding compensation, the WRC takes the following factors into account:

####  Your current loss of earnings

This is your loss of earnings from the date of the dismissal to the hearing of
your claim. Any money you earn during this period is deducted from the
compensation amount, and any payment you got _in lieu of notice_ (instead of
notice) when you were dismissed.

By law, you must try to lessen your losses during the period from your
dismissal to the hearing. You do this by being available for work and seeking
alternative employment.

If you have no actual loss because, for example, you took up other employment
immediately after your dismissal, you have a right to get a token compensation
of 4 weeks’ pay.

####  Your future loss of earnings

Your future loss of earnings are assessed, based on how long it’s likely to
take you to get a new job.

####  Your pension loss (if any)

This is a calculation of how the unfair dismissal has affected your pension
entitlements.

####  Your loss of statutory protection

This calculation deals with any protection you may have lost under the unfair
dismissals, redundancy and minimum notice legislation.

####  Any contributory conduct

This calculation takes into account any conduct (behaviour) by you that
contributed to the dismissal, even though it was an unfair dismissal.

The ‘degree of contribution’ (the level at which you contributed to the
dismissal) is stated as a percentage, and your overall compensation is reduced
by the same percentage.

##  Dismissal from fixed-term or specified-purpose contracts

A [ fixed-term contract ](/en/employment/employment-rights-and-
conditions/contracts-of-employment/rights-of-fixed-term-workers/) is a
contract of a specific length, agreed by you and your employer. A _specified-
purpose contract_ is also of a limited duration and ends when the job is
completed (but neither you nor your employer know from the outset how long it
will take).

###  Dismissal at the end of a contract

Dismissal at the end of a fixed-term or specified-purpose contract may be
considered ‘unfair’ under the Unfair Dismissals Acts. However, the employer
can prevent this by meeting 3 conditions:

  1. The contract must be in writing and set out the specific duration of the fixed-term contract (or, in the case of a specified-purpose contract, the object of the contract) 
  2. The contract must be signed by both the employee and the employer 
  3. The contract must contain a specific clause stating that the expiry of the contract will not make it liable to a claim under the Unfair Dismissals Acts 

If these 3 conditions are not met, then you can claim for unfair dismissal (as
long as you meet the usual eligibility criteria – see ‘Can I bring a claim for
unfair dismissal?’ above).

###  If you had successive fixed-term contracts

Employees cannot be employed on a series of fixed-term contracts indefinitely.

You cannot be kept on successive fixed-term contracts for more than 4 years.
This does not include a single fixed-term contract. For example, you can get a
5-year fixed-term contract, but you cannot get 5 one-year fixed-term
contracts.

If your employer wants you to continue in the job, they must employ you under
an open-ended contract (also called a _contract of indefinite duration_ ).

The only exception is where your employer has objective grounds justifying the
renewal of your fixed-term contract. The employer must prove that a further
renewal is appropriate and necessary to achieve a legitimate objective.

The Unfair Dismissal Acts have a special provision to make sure successive
temporary contracts are not used to avoid the employee having the protection
of the unfair dismissal legislation. Where a fixed-term or specified-purpose
contract ends, and you are re-employed within 3 months, you are deemed to have
continuous service.

So, even if the employer excludes the unfair dismissals legislation in the
manner described above, an adjudicator at the Workplace Relations Commission
(WRC) will consider whether the use of such contracts was wholly or partly to
avoid you having the protection of the unfair dismissals legislation.

If the WRC finds this was the case, and the contracts were not separated by
more than 3 months and the job was similar, then your case can be dealt with
as if you were in continuous employment. The employer must then justify your
dismissal in the normal way.

##  More information

The law on unfair dismissal is set out in the [ Unfair Dismissals Acts
1977-2015
](http://www.lawreform.ie/_fileupload/RevisedActs/WithAnnotations/HTML/EN_ACT_1977_0010.htm)
. The law does not actually protect you from dismissal, but it gives you a way
to appeal your dismissal and to question the fairness of it.
