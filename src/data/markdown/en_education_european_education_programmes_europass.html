##  What is Europass?

Europass is an online platform that can help you find information about work
and learning opportunities in the EU. You can also use it to make your skills
and qualifications clearly understood by employers and educators in other [ EU
countries ](/en/government-in-ireland/european-government/european-
union/european-union/) .

Europass brings together a number of documents that both learners and workers
in the EU may need.

The documents include:

  * [ Europass CV ](https://europa.eu/europass/en/create-europass-cv)
  * [ Mobility Document ](https://europa.eu/europass/en/europass-mobility-stakeholders)
  * [ Certificate Supplement ](https://europa.eu/europass/en/europass-certificate-supplement-stakeholders)
  * [ Diploma Supplement ](https://europa.eu/europass/en/diploma-supplement-stakeholders)

These documents are helpful when you move between EU countries to work or
study. It can make it easier for employers to understand your qualifications
from another EU State.  

You can also use Europass to [ search for qualifications, courses and learning
opportunities ](https://europa.eu/europass/eportfolio/screen/course?lang=en)
in other EU countries.

##  My Europass profile

A [ Europass profile ](https://europa.eu/europass/en/europass-profile-tool-
help-people-manage-their-learning-and-careers) is a personal record of your
skills and qualifications. You can record your work, education, training,
language skills and achievements. You can use the information in your Europass
profile to create CVs for jobs or courses that you may be applying for.

To start using Europass, you can [ complete your profile
](https://europa.eu/europass/en) online.

The Europass platform allows you to keep [ digitally-signed credentials
](https://europa.eu/europass/en/europass-alati/european-digital-credentials) .
These are statements by a learning organisation documenting your learning.
These include diplomas, transcript records and other certificates.  

##  Is there a fee for Europass?

You can access the Europass platform for free. There is no charge to set up
your Europass profile and store documents.

There is no funding available under the Europass programme towards the costs
of training abroad. However, EU funding is available for mobility programmes
through [ Erasmus + ](/en/education/european-education-programmes/erasmus-
plus/) .
