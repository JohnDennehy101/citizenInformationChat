#  Excise duties

  * Introduction 
  * Budget changes 

##  Introduction

Excise duty is charged on certain goods such as alcohol, tobacco and [ mineral
oils ](https://www.revenue.ie/en/companies-and-charities/excise-and-
licences/excise-duty-rates/mineral-oil-tax.aspx) (for example petrol, diesel
and kerosene).

The Revenue website has [ information about the different types of excise duty
](https://www.revenue.ie/en/companies-and-charities/excise-and-
licences/index.aspx) , including an [ overview of the current rates of excise
duty ](https://www.revenue.ie/en/companies-and-charities/excise-and-
licences/excise-duty-rates/index.aspx) .

##  Budget changes

There was an increase in the minimum excise duty on tobacco products, so that
all cigarettes sold below €11 have the same excise applied as those sold at
€11 and above.

The duty on bets placed by customers in the State increased from 1% to 2% for
bookmakers, and from 15% to 25% on the commissions earned by betting
intermediaries.

A new Sugar Sweetened Drinks Tax (SSDT) was announced. The SSDT is an excise
duty on sugar-sweetened drinks. The supplier making the first supply of sugar-
sweetened drinks in the State is liable for the tax.

There are 2 rates of tax depending on the total sugar content of the drinks.
Drinks with a total sugar content of less than 5 grams per 100ml are not
taxed. Once VAT is applied, a rate of 20 cent per litre applies to drinks with
a total sugar content of between 5 and 8 grams per 100ml while a rate of 30
cent per litre applies to drinks with a total sugar content of over 8 grams
per 100ml.

[ You can read more about the SSDT on revenue.ie

sweetened-drinks-tax/index.aspx) .
