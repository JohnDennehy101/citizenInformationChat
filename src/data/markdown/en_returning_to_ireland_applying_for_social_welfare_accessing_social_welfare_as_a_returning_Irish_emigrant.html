##  Introduction

You may need financial assistance when you return to Ireland. The Department
of Social Protection (DSP) has a range of social welfare payments that provide
financial support. This page gives an overview of those payments and how you
can apply for them.

Before you return to Ireland, [ check if there are any benefits you can
transfer to Ireland ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/moving-
country/moving-to-ireland/introduction-to-the-irish-system/moving-to-ireland-
and-your-social-security-entitlements/) .

Crosscare Irish Diaspora Support Project has information on what to do if you
are [ returning to Ireland in a crisis ](https://diasporasupport.ie/returning-
to-ireland/returning-in-crisis/) , especially if you are homeless.

You can also get information and advice from your local [ Citizens Information
Centre ](https://centres.citizensinformation.ie/) in Ireland. You can also
call the [ Citizens Information Phone Service (CIPS)
](https://www.citizensinformationboard.ie/en/services/citizensinformation/cips.html)
from 9am to 8pm, Monday to Friday, on 0818 07 4000. If you are calling CIPS
from outside Ireland, you should dial +353 21 229 8178.

##  Can I get a social welfare payment when I return to Ireland?

You may be able to get a social welfare payment when you return, depending on
your circumstances.

Social welfare payments are available for:

  * [ Carers ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/social-welfare-payments/carers/payments-to-carers/)
  * [ Families and children ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/social-welfare-payments/families-and-children/payments-to-families-and-children/)
  * [ Guardians and orphans ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/social-welfare-payments/death-related-benefits/guardian-and-orphan-payments/)
  * [ Older and retired people ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/social-welfare-payments/older-and-retired-people/income-supports-for-older-people/)
  * [ People who are disabled ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/social-welfare-payments/disability-and-illness/benefits-to-people-who-are-sick-or-have-a-disability/)
  * [ Unemployed people ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/social-welfare-payments/unemployed-people/)
  * [ Widows, widowers and surviving civil partners ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/social-welfare-payments/death-related-benefits/benefits-and-entitlements-following-a-death/)

##  Habitual Residence Condition

For certain social assistance payments, you need to show that Ireland is your
main place of residence. This is called the Habitual Residence Condition
(HRC). Some returning Irish immigrants can face difficulties with this
requirement.

The term “habitually resident” generally means that you:

  * Can prove close ties with Ireland 
  * Have been living in Ireland 
  * Plan to continue living here for the foreseeable future 

There are [ a range of materials you can provide as evidence
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/returning-to-ireland/applying-for-
social-welfare/habitual-residence-condition/#601334) to support your HRC
application. Along with these materials, you will need to complete the [ HRC1
form (pdf)
](https://www.gov.ie/pdf/?file=https://assets.gov.ie/27484/305a54e8a062459ab0b394e8f2031ce9.pdf#page=null)
and send it to the relevant authority (for example, to the Child Benefit
Section in the Department of Social Protection).

The Department considers 5 factors when deciding if you are habitually
resident:

  1. How long you have lived in Ireland or any other country 
  2. The reason you lived abroad 
  3. The nature and pattern of your employment 
  4. Your main place of interest 
  5. Your plans to live in Ireland for the foreseeable future, according to the evidence provided 

You can [ find out more about the 5 factors
](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/fc9c5e-operational-guidelines-for-
deciding-officers-on-the-determination-
of/?referrer=https://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/Habitual-Residence-Condition--
Guidelines-for-Deciding-Offic.aspx#five-factors) on the Department of Social
Protection’s website.

Crosscare Irish Diaspora Support Project’s website also has a useful [ FAQ on
the Habitual Residence Condition ](https://diasporasupport.ie/returning-to-
ireland/habitual-residence-condition/) .

##  How do I qualify for a social welfare payment?

There are [ different types of social welfare payments
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-
system/social-welfare-system-in-ireland/#24bf40) available. Some depend on
your income, and others depend on whether or not you have paid enough [ social
insurance contributions ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-
welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/social-insurance-prsi/social-insurance/) .

###  **Social insurance payments**

If you have worked and paid social insurance, you may qualify for a social
insurance payment.

When you apply for a social insurance payment, the DSP will check if you have
paid enough social insurance contributions to qualify. You may be able to use
your [ social insurance contributions from abroad
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-
system/claiming-a-social-welfare-payment/social-insurance-contributions-from-
abroad/) . For short-term payments (for example, Jobseeker’s Benefit) your
most recent social insurance contribution must have been paid in Ireland.

If you think you might qualify for a social welfare payment, you should apply.

###  **Social assistance payments**

If you have no income or your income is low, you may qualify for a social
assistance payment.

When you apply for a social assistance payment, all your income is considered.
This is called a [ means test ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-
welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/means-test-for-social-welfare-
payments/means-test/) . How your income is considered in the means test
depends on the payment you apply for.

You must also meet the Habitual Residence Condition (HRC) to get a social
assistance payment. Find more information on the [ ‘Habitual Residence
Condition’ section ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/returning-to-
ireland/applying-for-social-welfare/accessing-social-welfare-as-a-returning-
Irish-emigrant/#c25f40) above on this page.

###  **Universal Payments**

You can get a universal payment (such as Child Benefit), no matter your income
or social insurance record. To qualify, you must meet certain conditions.

##  How do I apply for a social welfare payment?

You must fill in an application form and provide other supporting
documentation, which the DSP assesses. The information and documentation you
provide is different depending on the payment type and your personal
circumstances.

You can [ apply online for some payments ](https://services.mywelfare.ie/) ,
such as Jobseeker’s allowance.

If you can’t apply online, you can get an application or claim form from:

  * The [ Department of Social Protection ](https://www.gov.ie/en/collection/a9ac9-social-welfare-application-forms/)
  * Your local [ Intreo Centre or Social Welfare Branch Office ](https://www.gov.ie/en/directory/category/e1f4b5-intreo-offices/) , or 
  * Your [ local Citizens Information Centre ](http://centres.citizensinformation.ie/) . 

To apply for a social welfare payment, you must have a [ Personal Public
Service Number (PPS number) ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/returning-
to-ireland/applying-for-social-welfare/pps-numbers-for-returning-irish-
emigrants-and-families/) .

##  How quickly will I get a social welfare payment?

You should apply for a social welfare payment as soon as you can. It can take
several weeks for the Department to make a decision on your application for a
payment.

While you are waiting, you can apply for an immediate payment of the [
Supplementary Welfare Allowance (SWA)
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/social-welfare-
payments/supplementary-welfare-schemes/supplementary-welfare-allow/) . SWA is
paid if your income is below a certain limit.
