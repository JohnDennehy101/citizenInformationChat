##  What is the Rental Accommodation Scheme?

If you are getting [ Rent Supplement ](/en/social-welfare/supplementary-
welfare-schemes/rent-supplement/) for a long period and you are in need of
long-term housing, you may qualify for the Rental Accommodation Scheme (RAS).
The scheme is run by local authorities.

The local authority makes the final decision about who qualifies for the
scheme. In general, people who are getting Rent Supplement for more than 18
months are considered for RAS.

The main difference between RAS and Rent Supplement is that you can get a
full-time job and can stay in the RAS scheme, with a recalculated rent.

The [ Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) ](/en/housing/renting-a-home/help-with-
renting/housing-assistance-payment/) will eventually replace RAS. However, you
cannot transfer from RAS to HAP.

##  How does the Rental Accommodation Scheme work?

Local authorities draw up contracts with landlords to provide housing for
people with a long-term housing need. The landlord agrees to provide housing
for a specific amount of time, and this is covered in the contract with the
local authority.

The local authority pays the rent directly to the landlord. You may still
contribute to your rent but you pay this contribution to your local authority,
not to your landlord.

The main points of the scheme are:

  * Your local authority pays the full rent to your landlord for you 
  * Your landlord must register your tenancy with the [ Residential Tenancies Board (RTB) ](/en/housing/renting-a-home/resolving-disputes/residential-tenancies-board/) and it is covered by residential tenancies legislation 
  * Your accommodation must meet [ minimum standards for private rental accommodation ](/en/housing/renting-a-home/tenants-rights-and-responsibilities/minimum-standards-for-rented-homes/) and your landlord is responsible for maintaining and repairing the property 
  * You do not need a deposit, as the local authority has the contract with your landlord 
  * If you get a full-time job, you can stay renting under RAS 

###  When you are a RAS tenant

You can stay on your local authorities housing waiting list, if you get
housing with RAS. However, you may need to apply to your local authority to go
on their transfer list. You can check the process for this in your local
authorities Housing Allocation Scheme. This is available on [ your local
authority’s ](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/942f74-local-authorities/)
website.

###  If your landlord plans to sell

Under RAS, your landlord signs a contract with the local authority to provide
housing for an agreed amount of time. However, if your landlord decides to
sell their property, they can terminate the contract.

RAS tenancies are covered by residential tenancies legislation, so your
landlord must follow the normal rules when terminating the tenancy.

Read about these rules in our page [ if your landlord wants you to leave
](/en/housing/renting-a-home/tenants-rights-and-responsibilities/if-your-
landlord-wants-you-to-leave/) .  

##  How much rent will I pay?

The rent that you pay is calculated according to the local authority’s
differential rent scheme. If your income increases, you will be asked to pay
more towards your rent. Check with your [ local authority
](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/942f74-local-authorities/) for the details
of their differential rent scheme.
