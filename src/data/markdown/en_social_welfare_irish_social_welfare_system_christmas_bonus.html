##  How much is the Christmas Bonus?

In 2023, the Christmas Bonus is 100% of your normal weekly payment (including
the [ Living Alone Increase ](/en/social-welfare/extra-social-welfare-
benefits/living-alone-allowance/) , the [ Island Allowance ](/en/social-
welfare/extra-social-welfare-benefits/island-increase/) and the Over-80
Increase).

If an Increase for a Qualified Adult is paid directly to your dependent
spouse, civil partner or cohabitant, the Christmas Bonus is also paid directly
to them.

If you are getting 2 eligible social welfare payments (for example, a One-
Parent Family Payment and the Domiciliary Care Allowance or a half-rate
Carer’s Allowance as well as your primary payment) you will get the Christmas
Bonus for both payments.

For Domiciliary Care Allowance (DCA), which is paid monthly, the bonus is 100%
of the **weekly** DCA rate. The DCA portion of the bonus is calculated
independently of other payments.
