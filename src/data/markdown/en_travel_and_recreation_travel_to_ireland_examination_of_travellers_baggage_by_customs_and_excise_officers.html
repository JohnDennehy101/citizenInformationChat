##  Introduction

This page outlines what you need to know about arriving in customs in Ireland.
It covers Customs Officers, customs searches and where you can go if you wish
to make a complaint.

**Returning to Ireland**

If you are an Irish person living abroad and planning to move home, visit our
new [ Returning to Ireland section ](/en/returning-to-ireland/overview-of-
returning-to-ireland/) where we have the practical information you need to
start a life in Ireland again.  

##  Customs checks

Customs and Excise officers carry out checks on [ imported goods (including
personal baggage) ](/en/travel-and-recreation/travel-to-ireland/customs-
regulations-for-travellers/) to prevent people from smuggling dutiable,
excisable or prohibited goods. These checks are regularly carried out on
travellers arriving from outside the EU (or from outside the EU via an EU
country). These travellers must make a Customs declaration, which is a
document with details of goods that are being imported or exported.

If you are arriving in Ireland from outside the EU via an EU country, you must
make a Customs declaration unless all your baggage was cleared by Customs
officers at your point of arrival in the EU. If you are [ entering or leaving
the European Union and carrying €10,000 or more in cash
](https://www.revenue.ie/en/importing-vehicles-duty-free-
allowances/travelling-with-
cash/index.aspx#:~:text=declarations%20for%20cash-,Overview,the%20amount%20declared%20is%20correct)
, you must make a special declaration to the Customs authority of the EU
country you are entering or leaving.

If all your baggage was cleared by Customs officers when you arrived in the
EU, you can proceed through the Blue Channel at your point of arrival in
Ireland. You usually use the Red Channel or the Green Channel if you are
making a customs declaration.

Travellers should go through the Red Channel if:

  * They have more than the allowances they are entitled to, or 
  * They are in doubt about whether they have more than the permitted allowances or 
  * They have prohibited or restricted goods. 

Travellers should go through the Green Channel if they have:

  * Only the allowances that they are permitted and 
  * They have no prohibited or restricted goods. 

Travellers arriving from outside the EU may be questioned and their baggage
may be examined. Travellers arriving from within the EU do not have to make a
Customs declaration and should proceed through the Blue Channel. However,
Customs officers can question these travellers if they have reason to doubt
that the person arrived from an EU country. Customs officers may also
intervene if they have reason to believe that:

  * Prohibited or restricted goods (including drugs) are being imported or exported 
  * An offence is being committed in respect of excisable products 

These procedures are in place to help protect public safety and to guard
against tax or duty fraud.

##  Can I be searched by a Customs officer?

Travellers can only be searched by Customs officers if an officer has reason
to suspect that:

  * They are carrying prohibited or uncustomed goods (uncustomed goods are goods that are imported, which are more than the traveller's allowance and not declared to Customs). 
  * They are carrying drugs on their person. 

If a Customs officer suspects that the person is carrying uncustomed or
prohibited goods, they must go before a superior officer of the Customs and
Excise service who will decide if there are sufficient grounds to search.

In practice, most searches made by Customs officers are because the officer
suspects the person is carrying drugs. If you are to be searched on suspicion
of carrying drugs:

  * You must understand the reason for the search. If Customs officers need to search a child or a person with a disability, it must be done in the presence of a parent or guardian. 
  * You can only be searched by an officer of the same sex 
  * Nobody of the opposite sex can be present if you have to remove clothing for the search (other than a hat, coat jacket, gloves, or similar articles of clothing) unless another person is needed because of your violent conduct 
  * You have the right to request that the search be carried out by a medical practitioner 
  * The search must be conducted in a room that the public does not have free access to. Windows must be screened, and doors secured to ensure complete privacy. 

If Customs officers find controlled drugs, you may be prosecuted. You may be
arrested or proceeded against later by summons.

If you refuse to be searched, you can be arrested without a warrant by the
Customs officer and may be prosecuted. If you are arrested by Customs
officers, you will be taken to the nearest police station to be charged with
an offence.

Customs officers keep records of all the searches that they conduct.

Additionally, anybody who is detained by Customs officers has the right to:

  * Access a solicitor 
  * Access a doctor 
  * Inform a relative or third party about their situation 

If you feel you have been unfairly treated by Customs officers, you can make a
complaint - see ‘Complaints about customs searches’ below.

##  Types of Search

###  Pat-down search

A pat-down search involves a search of outer clothing without the removal of
clothing.

###  Intimate body search

An intimate body search may involve the removal and search of clothing and a
visual examination of the undressed person by an officer or medical
practitioner to verify if drugs are being concealed.

You cannot be subjected to an intimate body search for drugs unless:

  * Customs officers have reasonable cause to suspect that you have a controlled drug. 

###  Internal body search

Customs officers do not carry out internal body searches.

###  Penalties for carrying uncustomed goods

The penalties for carrying uncustomed goods are generally three times the duty
paid value of the goods. The goods can also be seized along with any other
articles used to conceal or carry the uncustomed goods or anything that was
packed with them.

###  Penalties for carrying illegal drugs

The penalties for smuggling illegal drugs are set out in the [ Misuse of Drugs
Act (1977-2017), as amended
](https://revisedacts.lawreform.ie/eli/1977/act/12/front/revised/en/html) .
The penalties range from a fine (in the case of a person convicted of
importing a drug such as cannabis for personal use) to life imprisonment (for
the most serious offences, such as importing drugs for supply to others).

If you have any [ information about drug smuggling in Ireland
](https://www.revenue.ie/en/corporate/assist-us/drug-and-tobacco-
smuggling/customs-drugs-watch.aspx) , you can call the Customs Drug Watch
Confidential Freephone at 1800 295 295 or email NPC@revenue.ie.

##  Complaints about customs searches

If you feel that Customs officers have treated you unfairly, you should
complain to the Collector or other local manager. If you are unhappy with the
response, you can ask to have your complaint referred to the Customer Service
Manager in the relevant Region or District. Revenue has published a leaflet
(CS4) on their [ complaint and review procedures (pdf)
](https://www.revenue.ie/en/corporate/documents/customer-service/cs4.pdf) .
