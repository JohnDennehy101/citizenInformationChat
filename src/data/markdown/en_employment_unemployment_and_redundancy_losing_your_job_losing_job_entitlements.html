#  Losing your job - entitlements

  * Introduction 
  * How much notice should I get? 
  * Getting paid what you are owed 
  * How to complain 
  * Where to complain 

##  Introduction

If you are being [ dismissed from your job or made redundant
](/en/employment/unemployment-and-redundancy/losing-your-job/losing-your-job/)
you have certain entitlements including notice and pay for annual leave built
up but not taken.

This is a checklist of what your employer must give you when you leave work:

  * [ Pay that you are owed for work ](/en/employment/employment-rights-and-conditions/pay-and-employment/leaving-work-without-being-paid/) you have done 
  * [ A payslip ](/en/employment/employment-rights-and-conditions/pay-and-employment/pay-slip/) – showing your gross pay and any deductions 
  * Pay for annual leave which you have earned but not taken 
  * Pay instead of notice if you have not worked your notice period 
  * Information about what happens to your [ pension scheme ](/en/money-and-tax/personal-finance/pensions/occupational-pensions/) (if applicable) 

You no longer get a P45 when you lose your job. Now, when you leave a job your
employer will enter your leaving date and details of your final pay and
deductions into Revenue’s online system. You can view your pay details through
the ‘Manage your tax’ link in [ Revenue’s myAccount
](https://www.revenue.ie/en/online-services/services/manage-your-
record/manage-your-tax-for-the-current-year-paye-customers.aspx) .

##  How much notice should I get?

You may be entitled to notice if you are being let go from your job. This
means that you are given notice that your job will end, and a date when this
will come into effect. The length of notice you are entitled to, will depend
on your contract of employment. There is also a minimum entitlement set out in
the [ Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Acts 1973–2005
](http://revisedacts.lawreform.ie/eli/1973/act/4/revised/en/html) .

To be entitled to the legal (or 'statutory') minimum, you must have been
working for your employer continuously for at least 13 weeks.

###  Minimum period of notice

The amount of notice you are entitled to by law depends on how long you have
been working for your employer.

Duration of employment  |  Minimum notice   
---|---  
13 weeks to 2 years  |  1 week   
2 years to 5 years  |  2 weeks   
5 years to 10 years  |  4 weeks   
10 years to 15 years  |  6 weeks   
15 years or more  |  8 weeks   
  
For example, if you have worked for your employer for 5 years and 3 months you
get 4 weeks' notice.

While the notice entitlements under your contract of employment can be more
than the minimum periods above, your contract cannot have a notice period less
than the above.

This means that whatever your contract says, your employer must give you at
least the statutory minimum period of notice. You cannot get less, even if
your contract says this.

###  Continuous service

Your service is continuous unless you are dismissed or you leave your job.

Continuity of service is not normally affected by:

  * Strikes 
  * Lay offs 
  * Dismissal followed be immediate re-employment 
  * A transfer of undertaking (TUPE) 

####  Calculating continuous service

When calculating the length of your continuous service for notice purposes,
the following periods of absence from employment **are counted as service** :

  * Any period up to 26 weeks between consecutive periods of employment because of lay off, illness or by agreement with your employer 
  * Any period of lock-out from your employment 
  * Periods of absence due to service with the Reserve Defence Forces 

Any period of absence to take part in a strike **is not counted as service** .

###  Pay instead of notice

You may be required to work the notice period or you may accept pay in lieu
(instead) of notice, if offered.

Pay in lieu of notice means that you will not have to work for the period
between receiving notice and the end of your employment. You still get the
same amount of wages that you would have received, had you worked. This
payment is not regarded as wages or salary but as [ compensation for loss of
employment ](/en/employment/retirement/income-tax-in-retirement/retirement-
lump-sum-taxation/) , which may qualify for tax relief.

However, if your contract of employment allows for a payment on termination of
the contract or if you work for the period of notice, you pay tax and PRSI in
the normal way.

If you get pay in lieu of notice you are considered to be unemployed and
available for work during this period. This means that you can claim a [
jobseeker’s payment ](/en/social-welfare/unemployed-people/signing-on/) . You
cannot claim a jobseeker’s payment for any day that you are receiving holiday
pay (see below).

During your period of notice you should receive your normal pay. This also
applies if you are paid in lieu of notice.

###  Waiving your right to notice

Under employment legislation you can agree with your employer to waive your
right to notice.

If you both agree, your employer can pay you in lieu (instead) of notice. This
right is set down in [ Section 7
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1973/en/act/pub/0004/sec0007.html#zza4y1973s7)
of the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Act 1973.

###  Dismissal without notice

Your employer  may dismiss you without notice  for serious misconduct,
although you can challenge whether your employer was justified in dismissing
you.

##  Getting paid what you are owed

If you lose your job you have the right to be paid for work you have done. [
](/en/employment/employment-rights-and-conditions/pay-and-employment/leaving-
work-without-being-paid/)

[ If you have not been paid by the date of dismissal
](/en/employment/employment-rights-and-conditions/pay-and-employment/leaving-
work-without-being-paid/) or if you are still owed some wages, you have a
legal entitlement to be paid for your work.

###  **Holiday pay**

You are entitled to be paid for annual leave which you have earned but not
taken. The payment should equal the amount that would have been paid had the
annual leave been taken.

The ending of employment is the only situation where it is legal to pay an
employee instead of giving annual leave.

###  **Public holiday**

If your employment ends during the week ending on the day before a public
holiday and you have worked for your employer for the previous 4 weeks, you
should get an additional day's pay for the public holiday. This also applies
to part-time employees who have a right to the public holiday by working at
least 40 hours in the previous 5 weeks.  

##  How to complain

Your employer is responsible for giving you your proper notice. If you have
difficulty in getting your notice entitlement or if there is a dispute about
pay you are owed, your payslip or pay for annual leave you can make a
complaint to the [ Workplace Relations Commission.
](/en/employment/enforcement-and-redress/workplace-relations-commission/)

You should apply using the [ online complaint form
](https://www.workplacerelations.ie/en/Complaints_Disputes/Refer_a_Dispute_Make_a_Complaint/)
. You must make your complaint within 6 months of the dispute or complaint
occurring. The time limit may be extended for up to a further 6 months, if
there was reasonable cause for the delay.

For more information on your employment rights contact the Workplace Relations
Commission's [ Information and Customer Service
](https://www.workplacerelations.ie/en/contact_us/contact-details/) \- see
'Where to apply' below.
