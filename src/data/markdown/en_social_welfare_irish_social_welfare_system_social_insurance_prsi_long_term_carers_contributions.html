##  What are Long-Term Carers Contributions?

A new Long-Term Carers Contribution scheme was introduced in January 2024 to
help long-term carers access the State Pension (Contributory) when they reach
pension age.

Under the scheme, if you have been a full-time carer for at least 20 years
(1,040 weeks), you can get Long-Term Carers Contributions to help you qualify
for the [ State Pension (Contributory)
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/social-welfare-
payments/older-and-retired-people/state-pension-contributory/) .

A Long-Term Carers Contribution is the same as a paid contribution on your
PRSI record for each week that you provide full-time care. The contribution
makes it easier for you to qualify for the State Pension Contributory when you
reach pension age.

##  Do I qualify?

To qualify, you must:

  * Have lived in Ireland when you were providing the care 
  * Have been over 16 years and under pension age when you provided care 
  * Not have been in employment, self-employment, voluntary work, training or education courses for more than 18.5 hours a week 
  * Not have been getting a weekly social welfare payment when you were caring, except for [ Carer's Allowance, ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/social-welfare-payments/carers/carers-allowance/) [ Carer's Benefit, ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/social-welfare-payments/carers/carers-benefit/) [ Domiciliary Care Allowance ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/social-welfare-payments/disability-and-illness/domiciliary-care-allowance/) or [ Carer's Support Grant ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/social-welfare-payments/carers/carers-support-grant/)
  * Have lived with the person you were caring for and provided full-time care and attention. In some circumstances, you may qualify if you did not live with the person being cared for, but you provided full-time care and attention 

Normally, you need 520 employment contributions (which is 10 years of work) to
[ qualify for State Pension (Contributory)
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/older-and-retired-
people/state-pension-contributory/#8cce01) . However, if you have been a full-
time carer for at least 20 years (1,040 weeks), you do not need to have worked
for 10 years to qualify for State Pension (Contributory).

If you think you qualify for Long-Term Carers Contributions, you should
contact the Pension Caring Supports Unit of the Department of Social
Protection (see ‘Contact details’ below).

###  **Can I have my current pension reviewed?**

If you are over 66 and are currently getting a pension but think you may be
entitled to Long-Term Carers Contributions, you can ask to have your pension
reviewed (see ‘Contact details’ below).

If your pension is reviewed and you now qualify for a higher rate with Long-
Term Carers Contributions, your claim will not be backdated more than 6
months. This applies even if you are 70 and getting an [ Increase for a
Qualified Adult ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/irish-
social-welfare-system/claiming-a-social-welfare-payment/claiming-an-increase-
in-your-social-welfare-payment-for-an-adult-dependant/) .

If you wish to have your pension reviewed, you should contact the Pension
Caring Supports Unit of the Department of Social Protection. They will confirm
if you are entitled to Long-Term Carers Contributions (see ‘Contact details’
below).

##  What counts as full-time care?

To get a Long-Term Carers Contribution, you must be providing full-time care
to a person who needs full-time care.

A person is seen as needing full-time care when:

  * They need continual supervision to avoid danger to themselves, **or**
  * They need continual supervision and frequent assistance throughout the day with normal bodily functions. For example, help to walk and get about, eat or drink, get washed or dressed. 

The person being cared for must have the nature and extent of their disability
certified by a doctor.

##  How do I use Long-Term Carers Contributions to qualify for the State
Pension (Contributory)?

To get a State Pension (Contributory), you must have a certain number of paid
contributions. The number of contributions also determines your rate of
pension.

Once you have reached 20 years (1,040 weeks) of providing full-time care, you
can include Long-Term Carers Contributions in the calculation of your [ State
Pension (Contributory). ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-
welfare/social-welfare-payments/older-and-retired-people/state-pension-
contributory/) If you are entitled to Long-Term Carers Contributions, you do
not need 10 years of employment contributions to qualify for State Pension
(Contributory).

##  How to apply

You can apply for Long-Term Carers Contributions online at [ MyWelfare.ie.
](https://services.mywelfare.ie/en/topics/pensions-and-older-people/pension-
recalculation/) You must have a [ verified MyGovID account
](https://www.gov.ie/en/service/b6ecfd-sign-up-for-mygovid/) to apply using
MyWelfare.ie.

If you cannot apply online, you can contact Pension Caring Supports in the
Department of Social Protection to ask for a paper application form.
