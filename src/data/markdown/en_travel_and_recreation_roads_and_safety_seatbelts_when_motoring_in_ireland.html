#  Seat belts and the law

  * Introduction 
  * The laws on safety belts 
  * Child restraints 
  * Seat belts and passengers with a disability 
  * Enforcement of seat belt regulations 
  * Fines and penalty points 
  * Pre-1992 registered vehicles 

##  Introduction

Each year in Ireland, many people are hurt, seriously injured, or killed on
our roads. Some of these injuries and deaths could have been prevented if
drivers and passengers had been adequately restrained by [ seat belts or child
restraint systems ](https://www.rsa.ie/road-safety/road-users/vehicle-
components/vehicle-components/seatbelts-and-child-restraints) .

If seat belts are fitted, they must be worn by both drivers and passengers.
The driver is responsible for ensuring that passengers under 17 are suitably
restrained.

This page provides an overview of the law regarding the wearing of seat belts
and child restraints in motor vehicles. It also provides information on groups
of people exempted under the law.

##  The laws on safety belts

The law in Ireland requires the following vehicles to have seat belts:

  * Passenger vehicles that accommodate fewer than 8 people (excluding the driver) 
  * Passenger vehicles that accommodate more than 8 passengers and have a gross vehicle weight of less than 3,500 kg 
  * Goods vehicles that have a gross vehicle weight of less than 3,500 kg 

All buses transporting children must be fitted with the appropriate seat belts
or restraint systems for the number of children being transported. This does
not apply to general public bus services. Passengers in buses fitted with seat
belts must be informed of the requirement to wear them.

Under the [ Road Traffic (Construction, Equipment and Use of Vehicles)
(Amendment) Regulations 1971
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1971/en/si/0096.html) , the [ Road Traffic
(Construction, Equipment and Use of Vehicles) (Amendment) Regulations 1991
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1991/en/si/0359.html) and [ SI 240/2006
European Communities (Compulsory Use of Safety Belts and Child Restraint
Systems in Motor Vehicles
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2006/en/si/0240.html) ), the majority of
people travelling in motor vehicles in Ireland are required to wear a seat
belt or child restraint at all times.

###  What is a safety belt?

A safety belt consists of an assembly of straps adequately fixed to the
vehicle, with a securing buckle. These straps must be capable of being
adjusted. The safety belt is designed to minimise the risk of injury in an
accident or incident by restraining your movements.

##  Child restraints

###  Choosing and fitting a child car seat

All Children under 150 centimetres in height or weighing less than 36
kilograms (79lbs) must use a child restraint system suitable for their height
and weight while travelling in a car or goods vehicle (other than a taxi). You
can get more detailed information on [ choosing and fitting a child seat on
the RSA website ](https://www.rsa.ie/road-safety/road-
users/passengers/children/child-seats) . The RSA lists participating retailers
in their [ Code of Practice for Child Car Seat retailers (pdf)
](https://www.rsa.ie/docs/default-source/about/code-of-practice-for-child-car-
seat-retailers.pdf?Status=Master&sfvrsn=221c35f7_3) .

You must ensure that your child is in the correct car seat for their height or
weight. The weight range is indicated on the car seat or booster. The [ RSA
has a free, expert check it fit service ](https://www.rsa.ie/road-safety/road-
users/passengers/children/check-it-fits) available for parents.

You must de-active the front air bag if using a rear-facing car seat. Car
seats and boosters must meet EU or UN standards. See the [ FAQs about child
safety in vehicles on the RSA website ](https://www.rsa.ie/road-safety/road-
users/passengers/children/faqs) .

When travelling by bus, passengers aged 3 or over must wear seat belts, where
they are fitted.

You can get more detailed information on [ seat belts and child restraints
from the Road Safety Authority (RSA) website ](https://www.rsa.ie/road-
safety/road-users/vehicle-components/vehicle-components/seatbelts-and-child-
restraints) .

##  Seat belts and passengers with a disability

A ‘disabled person’s belt’ is a safety belt specially designed or adapted for
use by someone with a physical disability. These belts should only be used by
people for whom they are intended.

###  Exemptions from the requirement to wear seat belts

You do not need to wear a seat belt if you:

  * Are wearing a disabled person’s belt 
  * Have a medical certificate signed by a qualified medical practitioner stating it is inadvisable on medical grounds you wear a safety belt or child restraint 
  * Are teaching someone else how to drive (although going without a safety belt may not be advisable) 
  * Are a driving test examiner conducting a driving test 
  * Are a member of An Garda Síochána or the Defence Forces and are driving as part of your duties 

Drivers of small public service vehicles (such as taxis) are not exempt and
must wear seat belts when driving these vehicles.

##  Enforcement of seat belt regulations

The Gardaí are empowered by law to enforce seat belt regulations. Unless you
are exempted under the law, you are committing an offence if you do not wear a
seat belt or use an appropriate car seat or booster cushion. Penalties are
fixed-charge fines and penalty points, to ensure drivers comply with the law.
You can read more about [ driving offences ](/en/travel-and-
recreation/motoring/driving-offences/driving-offences/) .

##  Fines and penalty points

You can be fined €120 if you do not wear a seat belt. You must either pay this
fine within 28 days or face an increased fine of €180 payable within 56 days
of the offence. Three penalty points will be added to your licence if you
choose to pay the fine and not to go to court. However, if you are convicted
in court for not wearing a seatbelt, five penalty points will be added to your
licence and you will be fined €2,000.

##  Pre-1992 registered vehicles

All cars first registered in Ireland since 1 June 1971 must have seat belts
fitted on front seats. All cars first registered since 1992 must have seat
belts fitted on rear seats. In a pre-1992 registered car without fitted seat
belts, passengers are exempted from the law requiring them to use a safety
belt (or child restraint) when travelling in the back of the car. However, it
is strongly recommended you have seat belts or child restraints fitted.
