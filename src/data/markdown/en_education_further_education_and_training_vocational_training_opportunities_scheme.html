##  What is the Vocational Training Opportunities Scheme (VTOS)?

The Vocational Training and Opportunities Scheme (VTOS) provides courses to
improve your general level of education.

VTOS courses can help you to develop your skills and prepare you for
employment, self-employment or further education and training.

You can apply for VTOS if you are over 21 years of age, unemployed and have
been getting certain social welfare payments for at least 6 months.

You may keep your social welfare payment or get a VTOS Allowance.

VTOS is run by the local [ Education and Training Boards
](https://www.etbi.ie/etbs/directory-of-etbs/) and is aimed in particular at
unemployed people who are early school-leavers.

##  What kinds of VTOS courses are available?

The courses range from basic education and training to advanced vocational
training and there is a wide choice of subjects. The courses are full-time,
about 30 hours a week (for example, 6 hours a day for 5 days) and can last up
to 2 years.

Many courses lead to qualifications such as the Junior Certificate, Leaving
Certificate and awards at Levels 3, 4, 5 and 6 on the [ National Framework of
Qualifications. ](https://www.qqi.ie/what-we-do/the-qualifications-
system/national-framework-of-qualifications)

##  Rates for VTOS

###  For people getting jobseeker's payments

In general, VTOS participants who move from jobseeker's payments get a VTOS
training allowance at the maximum rate of the jobseeker's payment.

Generally, your entitlement to a VTOS training allowance will not be
reassessed if there is a change to your circumstances (including means).

**VTOS training allowance and work:** If you are returning to your course for
a second year, you will continue to get your VTOS allowance during the summer
months. You can also take up full-time work during the summer months and your
VTOS payment is not affected.

**VTOS training allowance and dependants:** If you want a dependent adult or
child added to your payment you must notify the Department of Social
Protection (DSP). DSP will then notify the ETB of any changes to your VTOS
training allowance.

###  Other supports

People on [ Post-Leaving Certificate courses (PLCs) ](/en/education/further-
education-and-training/post-leaving-certificate-courses/) who are getting VTOS
allowances are not eligible for student support grants. However, this does not
affect any entitlement they may have to exemption from college fees or student
contributions.

There are no fees for VTOS courses and you will get free books and materials
at the start of the course. Depending on your individual circumstances you may
be eligible for the following:

  * Meal allowance 
  * Travel allowance 
  * Childcare supports for your child under the [ National Childcare Scheme ](/en/education/pre-school-education-and-childcare/national-childcare-scheme/)

You can get more [ information about VTOS
](https://www.gov.ie/en/service/474eb7-vocational-education-and-training-
options-vtos/) .

VTOS training allowances are not taxable.

##  How to apply for VTOS
