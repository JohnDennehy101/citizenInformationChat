will increase from €339 to €352.

As from 1 January 2008, the PRSI contribution ceiling will increase from
€48,800 to €50,700.

###  Mortgage interest relief

The current annual ceiling on the amount of interest that can be allowed on a
mortgage is being increased with effect from 1 January 2008 for first-time
buyers from €8,000 to €10,000 for a single person and from €16,000 to €20,000
for married people. The additional relief will be available for the first
seven years for which there is an entitlement to mortgage interest relief.

###  Allowance for Rent  

The maximum level of rent paid for private rented accommodation on which tax
relief can be claimed, at the standard rate of tax, is being increased. For
those aged under 55 years of age, it is being increased from €1,800 to €2,000
per annum for a single person and from €3,600 to €4,000 per annum for widowed
and married people. This equates to a tax credit of €400 per annum for single
people and €800 for widowed and married people under 55 years of age.

single person and from €7,200 to €8,000 per annum for widowed and married
people. This equates to a tax credit of €800 per annum for a single person and
€1,600 per annum for widowed and married people over 55 years of age.

###  Rent-a-Room Scheme

The limit of the exemption from income tax which applies to rent received,
where a person rents out a room or rooms in their principal private residence,
is to be increased from €7,620 to €10,000.

###  Tax Relief on Trade Union Subscriptions

The standard-rated tax allowance in respect of subscriptions paid by members
of trade unions is to be increased from €300 to €350 per annum. This is
equivalent to a tax credit of €70 per annum.

###  Increase in the Specified Rates for Preferential Home Loans and Other
Loans

An employee who gets a preferential loan through their employer is charged
income tax on the difference between the interest actually paid and the amount
which would have been payable at the ''specified'' rates of interest for the
loans. To reflect increases in interest rates, the specified rate in respect
of home loans is being increased from 4.5% to 5.5 % and the specified rate in
respect of other loans is being increased from 12% to 13%. These changes will
take effect from 1 January 2008.

###  Tax relief on medical expenses

There are new provisions about tax relief on certain medical expenses,
contained in Section 9 of the Finance Act 2007, but only coming into effect at
a practical level now.

Up to 2007, the first €125 of certain health expenses in the claim year was
disallowed and didn't qualify for relief. With a claim for a family or other
dependents the first €250 of expenses incurred in that year was disallowed.

These thresholds have been abolished for tax year 2007. You can now claim tax
relief at your marginal rate on medical expenses incurred during 2007.

Furthermore, the provision that there is a defined relationship between the
taxpayer and the subject of the tax relief claim is being abolished in
relation to health expenses relief from 2007 onwards. Up to now, you could
only claim tax relief on expenses incurred by certain people (spouses, child
dependents, among others).

###  EU Tax Issue  

Following discussions with the European Commission, the tax treatment of
investment income and income attributable to the exercise of foreign
employments outside the State will extend to UK-sourced income. The Finance
Bill will extend the relevant treatment from 1 January 2008.

###  VAT

###  VAT Registration Thresholds for SMEs

The VAT registration thresholds for small businesses are being increased from
€35,000 to €37,500 in the case of services, and from €70,000 to €75,000 in the
case of goods. These increases will take effect from 1 May 2008\.

###  Review of VAT on Property Transactions

A review of the current system of applying VAT on property transactions has
been carried out. Provision will be made in the Finance Bill for the
introduction of a new system for applying VAT to property transactions. The
changes are designed to simplify the rules for VAT on property, while ensuring
a more equitable treatment for taxpayers. The new rules will apply to both
commercial and residential property supplied in the course of business. The
VAT charge on sales of residential property is unchanged.

The new system will take effect from 1 July 2008.

###  Vehicle Registration Tax  

The current VRT system uses engine size as the criterion to determine the VRT
rate to be applied to a car. Under the revised VRT system the CO2 emissions of
a car will replace engine size as the criterion to determine the VRT rate
payable on the car at point of registration. Lower emission cars will attract
reduced VRT rates and higher emission cars will be liable to higher rates. The
VRT rates will continue to be applied to the Open Market Selling Price of the
car. The revised VRT system will take effect on 1 July 2008.

The following Table sets out the CO2 Emission Bands and the relevant VRT rates
under the revised VRT system.

###  CO2 Emissions Bands

** CO2 Emissions Bands  ** ** ** |  ** g CO2/km  ** ** ** |  ** VRT Rates  ** ** **  
---|---|---  
A  |  0 - 120g  |  14%   
B  |  121 - 140g  |  16%   
C  |  141 - 155g  |  20%   
D  |  156 - 170g  |  24%   
E  |  171 - 190 g  |  28%   
F  |  191 - 225g  |  32%   
G  |  226g and over  |  36%   
  
###  Vehicle Registration Tax (VRT) Relief Scheme for Hybrid Electric and
Flexible Fuel Vehicles and VRT exemption for Electric Vehicles.

The existing 50% VRT relief scheme for series production hybrid electric
vehicles and flexible fuel vehicles expires on 31 December 2007. The scheme is
being extended in its current form from 1 January 2008 until 30 June 2008, at
which point the revised VRT scheme based on CO2 emissions will be implemented.
From 1 July 2008 the relief for series production hybrid electric and flexible
fuel cars will be adjusted to provide a relief of up to €2,500 on the VRT
payable, in addition to the benefit of the new VRT CO2 emission related
system. This relief will apply until 31 December 2010\.

Series production electric cars (i.e. cars which can be propelled solely by a
rechargeable battery) and electric/battery-assisted bicycles are being
exempted from VRT with effect from 1 January 2008.

###  Tobacco Excise

The Excise Duty on a packet of 20 cigarettes is being increased by 30 cents
(including VAT) with a pro-rata increase on other tobacco products, with
effect from midnight on 5 December 2007\.

###  Farmer taxation

###  Flat rate addition

The farmer's flat rate addition is being maintained at 5.2% for 2008.

###  Dissolution of farm partnerships

A new relief from Capital Gains Tax on the dissolution of farm partnerships
will be introduced in the Finance Bill. The relief will run for a period of 5
years and full details will be contained in the Finance Bill.

###  Milk Production Partnerships

Where a farmer on income averaging enters a milk production partnership the
provisions that can result in a clawback of income tax will no longer apply.

###  Stamp Duty

###  Reform of stamp duty on Residential Property

The current Stamp Duty system applicable to residential property is being
reformed.  
  
A simplified system, incorporating an exemption of €125,000 with 2 progressive
rates instead of the existing 6 rate bands, is being introduced with immediate
effect (5 December 2007).  
  
Transactions not exceeding the €125,000 exemption level will not be liable to
stamp duty. For amounts above this €125,000 exemption level, but not exceeding
€1 million, stamp duty will be charged at 7% on the excess over €125,000.
Where the property exceeds €1 million, the part in excess of €1 million will
be charged at 9% with the remainder between €125,000 and €1 million subject to
a 7% charge.  
  
In addition, properties with a value in excess of €125,000 but not exceeding
€127,000 will not be liable for stamp duty.  
  
This change will take effect in respect of instruments which are required to
be presented to the Revenue Commissioners for stamping no later than 5
December 2007\. Instruments which are executed in the 30 days prior to 5
December 2007 will therefore benefit from this change.  
  
Current exemptions in relation to first time buyers and buyers of new homes
will continue to apply.

###  Claw-back of relief for first-time purchasers and other owner-occupiers  

An exemption from stamp duty is generally available for first-time owner-
occupying purchasers of new or second-hand dwelling houses or apartments.
There is also an exemption available for other owner-occupying purchasers of
new dwelling houses or apartments under 125 square metres. In addition,
partial relief is also available to owner-occupying purchasers of new dwelling
houses or apartments over 125 square metres. These exemptions/reliefs are
clawed-back where the purchaser rents out the dwelling house or apartment,
other than under rent-a-room arrangements, within 5 years of the date of the
deed of transfer giving effect to the purchase.  
  
This claw-back period is being reduced for all three reliefs from 5 to 2 years

vehicles (except electric vehicles) will also increase by 9.5%. Fees for trade
plate licences will also increase by 9.5%. These new rates apply to motor tax

###  Motor tax for new and imported vehicles from July 2008

For new cars and pre-owned imports registered from 1 July 2008, motor tax
charges will be determined on the basis of seven CO2 bands. Charges will range
from €100 a year for the greenest cars to €2,000 for cars with the highest
emissions ratings.  

Motor tax rates for new cars from 1 July 2008  Band  |    
CO2 Emissions per kilometre  
|  Motor Tax Rate €  
---|---|---  
A  |  under 120grams  |  100   
B  |  between 121 and 140 grams  |  150   
C  |  between 141 and 155 grams  |  290   
D  |  between 156 and 170 grams  |  430   
E  |  between 171 and 190grams  |  600   
F  |  between 191 and 225 grams  |  1,000   
G  |  over 225grams per kilometre  |  2,000   
  
Existing cars will continue to be taxed on the current basis of engine size.

###  CO2 emissions and Vehicle Registration Tax (VRT)

Under a revised Vehicle Registration Tax (VRT) system the CO2 emissions of a
car will replace engine size as the criterion to determine the VRT rate
payable on the car at point of registration. Lower emission cars will attract
reduced VRT rates and higher emission cars will be liable to higher rates. The
VRT rates will continue to be applied to the Open Market Selling Price of the
car. The revised VRT system will take effect on 1 July 2008.

**CO2 Emission Bands and the relevant VRT rates** ** CO2 Emissions Bands  **
** **  
|  ** g CO2/km  ** ** **  
|  ** VRT Rates  ** ** **  
  
---|---|---  
A  
|  0 - 120g  
|  14%  
  
B  
|  121 - 140g  
|  16%  
  
C  
|  141 - 155g  
|  20%  
  
D  
|  156 - 170g  
|  24%  
  
E  
|  171 - 190 g  
|  28%  
  
F  
|  191 - 225g  
|  32%  
  
G  
|  226g and over  
|  36%  
  
  
###  Hybrid electric vehicles and flexible fuel vehicles

The existing 50% VRT relief scheme for series production hybrid electric
vehicles and flexible fuel vehicles is being extended in its current form from
1 January 2008 until 30 June 2008, at which point the revised VRT scheme based
on CO2 emissions will be implemented.

From 1 July 2008 the relief for series production hybrid electric and flexible
fuel cars will be adjusted to provide a relief of up to €2,500 on the VRT
payable, in addition to the benefit of the new VRT CO2 emission related
system. This relief will apply until 31 December 2010.

Series production electric cars (i.e. cars which can be propelled solely by a
rechargeable battery) and electric/battery-assisted bicycles are being
exempted from VRT with effect from 1 January 2008.

###  Car leasing

A revised scheme of capital allowances and leasing expenses for cars used for
business purposes is being introduced. Cars will be categorised by reference
to CO2 emissions with the emissions bands being broadly consistent with the
new VRT system, as follows:

  * Cars with CO2 emission levels in Category A/B/C above will benefit from capital allowances at the current car value threshold under the existing scheme of €24,000, regardless of the cost of the car. Cars in Category D/E will receive allowances of 50% of the current car value threshold or 50% of the cost of the car, if lower. Cars in Category F/G will not qualify for capital allowances. 
  * As regards leasing expenses, cars in Category A/B/C will benefit from a proportionately higher deduction than the actual leasing expenses where the cost of the car is less than €24,000. Cars in Category D/E will get 50% of the leasing expenses they would otherwise benefit from under the current scheme. Cars in Category F/G will not qualify for a deduction for leasing expenses. 

The revised scheme will come into effect in respect of cars purchased or
leased on or after 1 July 2008.

###  Lighting  

Minimum energy efficiency standards for lighting will be introduced from 2009.
The standards will result in an effective ban on the sale of the most
inefficient traditional light bulbs.

Legislation will be prepared by the Department of the Environment next year
setting a general energy efficiency standard of 25 lumens per watt. As part of
preparation of the legislation, there will be consultation with all
stakeholders to ensure the measures can be effectively implemented.

###  Environmental protection

There is an additional €13 million for the Environment Protection Agency (EPA)
to go towards essential research and development and monitoring, the cost of
construction of an extension to the EPA headquarters in Wexford and staffing.
This brings the total allocation to over €39 million for 2008.

There is an additional €8 million for National Heritage (National Parks and
Wildlife) to go towards the management and consolidation of National Parks
properties and the cost of monitoring and management programmes as required
under the various EU Habitats and Birds Directives.

allocation to €13.5 million in 2008.

An extra €4 million current funding is being provided for payments under the
Salmon Hardship Scheme and €2.8 million current funding is being provided to
Inland Fisheries Boards for their role in the implementation of the Water
Framework Directive.

A further €35 million has been allocated to meet increased demand under the
Farm Waste Management Scheme, to facilitate compliance with environmental
conditions and standards required by the EU Nitrates Directives.

An additional €10 million is allocated for an enhanced fishing vessel
decommissioning scheme, with a view to achieving a more appropriate balance
between fishing capacity and stocks. The scheme involves a package of aid to
encourage a reduction of some 35% in the Irish Whitefish Fleet, which is
essential for the development of a sustainable seafood industry.

An additional €18 million is being allocated for the Office of Public Works
for flood relief projects in a number of locations throughout the country.

###  Water services

An additional €45 million will be invested in water services in 2008 to
continue infrastructural support for social and economic development.

###  Energy conservation  

Capital funding of €13 million will go towards energy conservation, for
insulation, efficiency and building rating schemes and for a range of
initiatives which will promote new technologies, increase awareness of energy
efficiency and improve capacity to deliver in this area.

There is an allocation of €7 million capital funding to energy research which
will mainly fund measures to develop renewable energy from ocean sources.

The VAT rate on the supply of elephant grass rhizomes, seeds, bulbs, roots and
similar supplies used for the agricultural production of bio-fuels will be
reduced from 21% to 13.5% with effect from 1 March 2008.
