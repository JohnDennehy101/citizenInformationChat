##  What is stalking?

Stalking is when another person causes you:

  * To fear that violence will be used against you or someone close to you 
  * Serious alarm or distress that has a negative impact on your day-to-day life and sense of safety and well-being. 

Stalking behaviour is usually fixated, obsessive, unwanted and repeated.
Stalkers can be unpredictable and dangerous.

Stalking is now a crime under the [ Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous
Provisions) Act 2023.
](https://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2023/act/24/enacted/en/html)

###  Examples of stalking

You may be experiencing stalking if someone is:

  * Watching, monitoring, tracking or spying on you 
  * Threatening to harm you or someone close to you 
  * Pestering you 
  * Impersonating or pretending to act as you 
  * Communicating with others about you or pretending to act or communicate on your behalf. 
  * Disclosing private information about you to other people 
  * Interfering or damaging your property, including your pets 
  * Loitering near where you are as you go about your life: at home, at work and socially. 
  * Interfering with your email, and phone communications or online activity. 
  * Breaching a court order that prohibits them from communicating with or about you or approaching you

rights-options/safety-planning/)

###  Talk to the Gardaí

Report stalking to the Gardaí by ringing 999/112 or [ contact your local Garda
station. ](https://www.garda.ie/en/contact-us/station-directory/) Stalking is
a criminal offence in Ireland. The police should be involved in these
situations as early as possible.

###  Your legal options

If your stalker **is** a current or former intimate partner or your a family
member, you can apply for a protective order such as safety or barring order.
[ Read more about protective orders and how to get one.
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/birth-family-relationships/problems-
in-marriages-and-other-relationships/barring-safety-and-protection-orders/)

If your stalker **is not** your current or former partner or a family member,
you can get a Section 28 Civil Restraining Order to ban the person from
continuing the stalking behaviour.

##  What is a civil restraining order?

A restraining order or ‘civil order against relevant conduct’ is a court order
against an offending person to stop the stalking behaviour.

###  **What does a restraining order stop an offender from doing?**

A civil restraining order may ban an offender person from:

  * Using or threatening to use violence against you, molesting or putting you in fear 
  * Following you or communicating by any means with or about you 
  * Approaching a particular place such as your home, workplace, or school 
  * Doing anything else that the court specifies 

Restraining orders are separate from the [ orders where there is an accusation
of domestic violence ](/ga/birth-family-relationships/problems-in-marriages-
and-other-relationships/barring-safety-and-protection-orders/) . If your
stalker **is** a current or former intimate partner or a family member you can
[ apply for a protective order ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/birth-
family-relationships/problems-in-marriages-and-other-relationships/barring-
safety-and-protection-orders/) .

##  How can I get a restraining order?

You can apply for a Section 28 Civil Restraining Order at the District Court
if you are experiencing stalking from a person who is not your:

  * Current or former partner or 
  * Family member 

The order may also protect another person connected to you (e.g., a child,
partner).

For more information [ contact your local district court
](https://www.courts.ie/district-court) or contact [ An Garda Síochána.
](https://www.garda.ie/en/)

###  **A garda can apply on your behalf**

If a Garda is aware of the person’s relevant conduct, and in their opinion
justifies you making an application, they can apply on your behalf.

A garda must seek out your views before applying for a civil restraining order
for you.

###  **What happens at the District Court?**

The District Court can only hear the application when the person accused has
been informed of the application.

Before the District Court issues a civil restraining order, it must be
satisfied that:

  * The person accused has behaved in a wrongful way (engaged in relevant conduct) 
  * The order is necessary and proportionate to protect your safety and welfare 

##  Emergency temporary restraining orders

If you believe there is an immediate risk to your safety and welfare, you can
apply on an emergency basis for a temporary civil restraining order. An
emergency temporary restraining order application can be made without the
offending person being notified in advance.

A temporary civil restraining order lasts for a maximum of 8 days, but a court
may specify a shorter time period.

##  When does a restraining order take effect?

When the person subject to the restraining order is notified, the civil
restraining order takes effect.

If that person is present in court, the order begins immediately.

If they are not in court, they have to be told and provided with a copy of the
court’s order. The court may direct a garda to do this.

##  How long does a restraining order last?

A civil restraining order lasts for 5 years unless a shorter period is stated
in the order, or it is discharged or cancelled by the courts.

##  Appealing against a restraining order

You can appeal against a civil restraining order to the [ Circuit Court
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/justice/courts-system/circuit-court/)
. You must appeal within 14 days of the order being made. The Circuit Court
may extend the appeal period, but only for good reason.

The civil restraining order remains in force until the outcome of the appeal
unless the District Court or the Circuit Court puts a stay (suspension) on the
order.

During the appeal, the court will re-hear the application for an order. The
Circuit Court can decide to:

  * Make the same order 
  * Make a different order 

or

  * Refuse to make an order. 

##  Changing or ending a restraining order

A court can change or end a civil restraining order after it is made if the
victim, the person under the civil restraining order, or a garda applies to
change or end the order.

If an application to change or end a civil restraining order is made by:

  * The **victim** , the person under the civil restraining order must be notified. 
  * The **person under the civil restraining order** , the victim must be notified. 
  * A **garda** , they must notify both the victim and person under the civil restraining order. 

A court only varies or ends an order if it considers it necessary or
proportionate to do so.

##  Breaking a civil restraining order

You must comply with a restraining order issued by a court. If you do not
comply and break the civil restraining order, then you are committing a
criminal offence and you are liable on conviction to a [ class B fine
](/ga/justice/criminal-law/criminal-trial/fines-for-criminal-offences/) or [
imprisonment for up to 12 months ](/ga/justice/criminal-law/criminal-
trial/types-of-sentences/) .

You may also be arrested without a warrant for failure to comply with an ASBO
(an anti-social behaviour order).

##  Further information
