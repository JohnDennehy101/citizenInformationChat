##  What is a GP visit card?

A GP visit card is a card that gives you free visits to a participating family
doctor (GP). If you are not eligible for a [ medical card
](/en/health/medical-cards-and-gp-visit-cards/medical-card/) , you may be
eligible for a GP visit card.

You can [ apply for a GP visit card online.
](https://www2.hse.ie/services/schemes-allowances/gp-visit-cards/gp-visit-
cards/)

###  What does a GP visit card cover?

Your GP visit card covers the cost of visits to your GP and visits to [ GP
out-of-hours services
](http://www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/3/outofhours/GPOOH.html) . You can read
more about what services are available with the [ medical card and GP visit
card. ](/en/health/health-services/gp-and-hospital-services/gp-services-to-
medical-card-holders/)

####  What is not covered by the GP visit card?

The GP visit card does not cover [ hospital charges ](/en/health/health-
services/gp-and-hospital-services/hospital-charges/) .

Prescribed drugs are not free but may be covered by the [ Drugs Payment Scheme
](/en/health/drugs-and-medicines/drugs-payment-scheme/) .

##  Who can get a GP visit card?

You must be [ ordinarily resident in Ireland ](/en/health/health-
system/entitlement-to-public-health-services/) to apply for a GP visit card.
This means that you are living in Ireland and intend to live here for at least
one year.

You will qualify for a GP visit card with **no means test** **if you are** :

  * Aged under 8 (see [ GP visit cards for children ](/en/health/medical-cards-and-gp-visit-cards/gp-visit-cards-for-under-8s/) ) 
  * Aged over 70 
  * Getting [ Carer’s Benefit ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/social-welfare-payments/carers/carers-benefit/) or [ Carer’s Allowance ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/social-welfare-payments/carers/carers-allowance/) , at full or half-rate 

**If you are aged under 70, your income is assessed** by the HSE to see
whether you qualify for a GP visit card. See below for information about the
HSE basic rates of income.

##  Income limits for people aged under 70

Your income is assessed by the HSE using the [ means test for people aged
under 70 ](/en/health/medical-cards-and-gp-visit-cards/medical-card-means-
test-under-70s/) . However, the basic rates of income for the GP visit card
are higher than the limits for the medical card.

Your **weekly net income** is compared to the HSE's weekly basic rate of
income _._ This is your income after tax, PRSI and universal social charge
(USC) have been deducted. There are extra allowances for children.

If your income is above the weekly basic rate you may still qualify for a GP
visit card after you include allowable expenses such as childcare and rent
(see ‘Allowable expenses’ below).

The weekly basic rates of income increased on 11 September 2023 and again on
13 November 2023. If you were not eligible in the past, you may be eligible
now.

**GP visit card weekly** __ **basic rates of income for people under 70** **Category** |  **Since 13 November 2023**  
---|---  
Single person living alone  |  €418   
Single person living with family  |  €373   
Married or cohabiting couple (or lone parent with dependent children)  |  €607   
Allowance for each of first 2 children aged under 16  |  €57   
Allowance for 3rd and for each subsequent child under 16  |  €61.50   
Allowance for each of first 2 children aged over 16 (with no income)  |  €58.50   
Allowance for 3rd and for each subsequent child over 16 (with no income)  |  €64   
Each dependant over 16 years in full-time non-grant aided third-level education  |  €117   
  
###  **Allowable expenses**

Some living expenses are allowable. This means they increase your weekly basic
rate of income.

Allowable expenses include:

  * Childcare costs 
  * Rent (not including any amounts paid by [ Housing Assistance Payment ](/en/housing/renting-a-home/help-with-renting/housing-assistance-payment/) or [ Rent Supplement ](/en/social-welfare/supplementary-welfare-schemes/rent-supplement/) ) 
  * Reasonable mortgage payments on your family home and other land or property. 
  * Mortgage protection insurance and associated life assurance. 
  * Home insurance. 
  * Maintenance payments you make. 
  * Nursing home, private nursing or home care costs for you or your spouse. 
  * Costs of travelling to work including: 
    * The cost of public transport. 
    * Driving expenses if a car is required, at a rate of 30 cent per mile/18 cent per km. If a couple needs two cars to travel to work, a double allowance applies. The cost of parking can be taken into account. 
    * Reasonable contributions towards carpooling costs. 

See [ examples of how you or your family’s income is calculated
](/en/health/medical-cards-and-gp-visit-cards/examples-of-calculating-
eligibility-for-gp-visit-card-for-under-70s/) when you apply for a GP visit
card.

Read the [ HSE National Assessment Guidelines for medical card and GP visit
card (pdf) ](https://www.hse.ie/eng/staff/pcrs/medical-card-and-gp-visit-card-
assessment-guidelines.pdf) . You can also find a list of the documents you
need to support your application.

###  Aged over 70 with dependants

If you are aged over 70, you are eligible for a GP visit card regardless of
your income.

If you are over 70 and you have dependants who are aged under 70, for example,
a spouse or partner your dependants may qualify for a GP visit card if your
combined gross income is over €1050, but not greater than €1,400 a week.

If either of you are aged over 70, you will both qualify for a full [ medical
card ](/en/health/medical-cards-and-gp-visit-cards/medical-card/) if your
combined gross income is €1050 or less per week.

###  Finances over the **qualifying financial threshold**

When you apply for a GP visit card, the HSE will first assess your application
for a [ medical card ](/en/health/medical-cards-and-gp-visit-cards/medical-
card/) . If you don't qualify for a medical card, you will then be assessed
for a GP visit card.

If your finances are over the qualifying financial threshold for a medical
card or GP visit card, you may still qualify for a discretionary medical card
if your medical expenses would cause you financial hardship without one.

If you want to [ apply for a discretionary medical card
](https://www2.hse.ie/services/medical-cards/discretionary-medical-cards.html)
, you should also include information about your family’s medical expenses in
your application.

##  How to apply for a GP visit card

###  Aged under 70

If you are under 70, you use the same application process to apply for a GP
visit card as for a [ medical card
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/health/medical-cards-and-gp-visit-
cards/medical-card/) . So, as part of the application process for the GP visit
card, your entitlement to a medical card is automatically assessed.

You can apply for a medical card or GP visit card online on [ medicalcard.ie
](https://www.mymedicalcard.ie/)

You can also [ download an application form for the GP visit card and medical
card (pdf)
](https://assets.hse.ie/media/documents/Medical_Card_and_GP_Visit_Card_Application_Form.pdf)
and email it to [ pcrs.applications@hse.ie ](mailto:PCRS.Applications@hse.ie)
or post it to:

National Medical Card Unit,

PO Box 11745,

Dublin 11

###  Aged over 70

If you are aged 70 or over, you can [ register for your GP visit card online
](https://www2.hse.ie/services/schemes-allowances/gp-visit-cards/over-70s/) .

You can also [ download the registration form for people aged 70 and over
(pdf) ](https://www.hse.ie/eng/cards-schemes/gp-visit-cards/over-70s-gp-visit-
card/over-70s-gp-visit-card-application-form.pdf) and email it to [
pcrs.applications@hse.ie ](mailto:pcrs.applications@hse.ie) or post it to:

National Medical Card Unit,

GP Visit Card Over 70s,

PO Box 12629,

Dublin 11.

You can also call 0818 22 44 78 to ask for a paper registration form.

###  **Application for a spouse or partner**

If you are over 70, with a dependant spouse or partner who is under 70, and
you think your finances may be under the qualifying financial threshold, you
can apply for GP visit cards for both of you. To do this, you use the standard
[ medical card/GP visit card application form (pdf)
](https://assets.hse.ie/media/documents/Medical_Card_and_GP_Visit_Card_Application_Form.pdf)
and include details of your income and allowable expenses. (For the HSE weekly
basic income rates, see ‘Dependants of people aged over 70’ above).

###  Applying if you are a carer

If you get Carer’s Benefit or Carer’s Allowance, at full or half-rate, you are
eligible for a GP visit card. [ You can register for the GP visit card for
carers by email or post ](https://www.hse.ie/eng/cards-schemes/gp-visit-
cards/gp-visit-card-for-carers/) .

###  Appealing your GP visit card application

If your application for a GP visit card is refused, you will receive a letter
from the HSE to let you know. The letter will also set out the reasons why
your application has been refused.

If you are not satisfied with the decision, you may have it reviewed. Your
circumstances may have changed, or you may have left out some relevant
information from the original application.

If you are not satisfied with the review, you can make an appeal to the [
Appeals Office of your HSE Area ](https://www2.hse.ie/services/schemes-
allowances/medical-cards/applying/appeal/) . You can also find the contact
details for the Appeals Office in the letter of refusal from the HSE.

The Appeals Office will conduct a reassessment of your application. This will
be conducted by HSE staff who were not involved in deciding on your original
application.

###  Reviews

Your entitlement to a GP visit card is reviewed periodically by the HSE. This
is because your circumstances may change. If you don’t return your review
form, your GP visit card may not be re-issued.

If you return your review form by the given date but the review process
continues past the expiry date of your card, the HSE may extend your card’s
validity so that you can continue to use it while the review is taking place.
The extension is on a month-by-month basis, so it is advisable to contact the
HSE Client Registration Unit (contact details below) to confirm that your card
has been extended and continues to be valid.
