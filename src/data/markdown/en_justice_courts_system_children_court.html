##  Introduction

The Children Court deals with criminal charges involving children under the
age of 18.

[ The Children Act 2001
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2001/en/act/pub/0024/index.html) is the main
piece of legislation that deals with youth justice. The Act aims to ensure
that the work of the Children Court considers the best interests of the child
concerned.

This page describes the rules of the Children Court, including the types of
cases it hears, privacy and in-camera rules, and the age of criminal
responsibility for children.

Read more about [ children and young offenders ](/en/justice/children-and-
young-offenders/) .

##  How the Children Court works

The purpose of the Children Court is to separate court cases involving
children from those which involve adults.

In Dublin, a separate Children Court venue in Smithfield hears youth justice
cases.

Outside of Dublin, Children Court cases are often held in the [ District Court
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/justice/courts-system/district-court/)
on different days or at different times to when adult cases are heard.

Judges who sit in the Children Court may be asked to do special training by
the President of the District Court. The Children Court operates to ensure
that the best interests of the child are taken into account.

###  **Age of children dealt with by the Children Court**

The Children Court deals with criminal proceedings for children under the age
of 18. Generally, children under 12 will not be charged with an offence.

However, if a child is aged 10 or 11, their case may be heard in the Central
Criminal Court if they are charged with these offences:

  * Murder, 
  * Manslaughter 
  * Rape, or 
  * Aggravated sexual assault 

###  **Children aged under 14 years**

If a child under the age of 14 is charged with a criminal offence, the [
Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) ](/en/justice/law-enforcement/director-
of-public-prosecutions/) must give their consent for the child to be tried.

A judge can dismiss a case against a child under the age of 14, if they have
considered the child’s age and level of maturity and are satisfied that the
child did not fully understand what was involved when carrying out the
offence.

##  What types of cases are heard in the Children Court?

The Children Court has the power to deal with most criminal offences committed
by children. Hearings for all minor offences are held in the Children Court,
as are most serious, indictable offences. Indictable offences are crimes so
serious that the charges must normally be heard before a jury in the higher
courts.

###  **Cases the Children Court cannot hear**

Certain offences cannot be heard by the Children Court and must be heard in
the [ Central Criminal Court ](/en/justice/courts-system/high-court/) . These
offences include:

  * Murder 
  * Attempted murder 
  * Conspiracy to murder 
  * Manslaughter 
  * Rape 
  * Aggravated sexual assault 
  * Piracy 
  * Treason

##  How is it decided which court will hear the child’s case?

###

Under the [ Irish Constitution ](/en/government-in-ireland/irish-
constitution-1/constitution-introduction/) a child has a right to be tried
before a jury for non-minor offences. The judge asks the child if they want to
have their case heard:

  * In the Children Court (if the judge is willing to hear the non-minor offence in the Children Court), or 
  * Before a [ judge ](/en/justice/courtroom/judge/) and [ jury ](/en/justice/courtroom/jury/) in the higher courts 

The child can ask a parent or guardian to help with this decision.

##  If a child and adult are charged with the same offence

###  **Minor offence**

When a child is charged with a minor offence, with one or more adults, the
offence should be heard in the Children Court. The adult will be heard as if
they were before the District Court.

The Children Court can also decide that the child and adult be heard in the
District Court.

###  **Serious offence**

In situations where a child and adult are jointly charged with serious
offences, the child will be heard by the Children Court as if the child was
charged on their own. The adult will be heard in the appropriate court for the
serious offence.

###

##  If a child pleads guilty to a serious offence

If a serious offence would normally be dealt with by a higher court, but a
child pleads guilty in the Children Court before the judge has sent the case
to the higher court, then the judge can only send the child to the higher
court for sentencing.

However, before this can happen the child must sign a plea of guilty, and the
court must be satisfied that the child understands the seriousness of the
offence and the allegations against them. The [ Director of Public
Prosecutions ](http://www.dppireland.ie/) must also consent to the child’s
guilty plea.

##  Who can attend the Children Court?

The Children Court is a private court and there are restrictions on who can be
present in the courtroom when the court is sitting.

The following people are allowed in the courtroom during Children Court
proceedings:

  * Officers of the court 
  * The parents or guardian of the child concerned 
  * The child and their legal representatives ( [ solicitor ](/en/justice/courtroom/solicitors/) or [ barrister ](/en/justice/courtroom/barristers/) ) 
  * People directly involved in the proceedings (for example, witnesses) 
  * An adult relative of the child or another adult, if the child’s parents or guardian are not present 
  * Bona fide representatives of the press 
  * Other people that the court allows to remain at the proceedings at the court’s discretion 

###  **Court proceedings are held in private**

The [ in-camera rule ](/en/justice/legal-terms-explained/) applies to the
Children Court, and means that the court proceedings cannot be held in public.
However, the decisions and orders of the Children Court are made available to
the public.

However, as proceedings are held in private, if a report reveals the name,
address, or school of the child, or includes information likely to identify
the child, it cannot be published or broadcast unless the court orders
specific details to be revealed for a specified reason. It is a criminal
offence to break this privacy rule.

###  **A parent’s role in the Children Court**

A child's parents or guardian must attend the Children Court when their child
is in the Children Court unless excused.

If a parent or guardian does not attend, the judge can issue a [ bench warrant
](/en/justice/legal-terms-explained/) for them. This means the Gardaí can
arrest the child’s parents or guardian to ensure they are brought before the
judge.
