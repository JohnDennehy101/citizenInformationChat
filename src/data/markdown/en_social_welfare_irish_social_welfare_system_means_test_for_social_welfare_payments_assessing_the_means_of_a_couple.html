#  Assessing the means of a couple for social assistance payments

  * Introduction 
  * Carer's Allowance 

##  Introduction

If you are married, in a civil partnership or cohabiting the Department of
Social Protection (DSP) will assess both of your means when carrying out a
means test for a social assistance payment. This is the case even if only one
of you is actually claiming a payment.

For some social assistance payments, the DSP adds all of your means together
and then halves them to get the assessable means for each one of you. For
others, the DSP adds all your means together and then assesses them against
the maximum household payment for your circumstances.

This document gives a general overview of how the means test is carried out
for couples. You should also read the document on the payment you are getting
or have applied for as it will give more detail on income not taken into
account (or disregarded) for each payment.

For more general information you can read our document on [ the means test
](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/means-test-for-social-
welfare-payments/means-test/) . If you are getting a social insurance payment
such as Jobseeker's Benefit or State Pension (Contributory) and wish to claim
a payment for your spouse, civil partner or cohabitant only their means will
be tested. You can find out more about claiming a payment for a qualified
adult in our document [ Claiming for an adult dependant ](/en/social-
welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/claiming-a-social-welfare-
payment/claiming-an-increase-in-your-social-welfare-payment-for-an-adult-
dependant/) .

Note that in general if you have a joint account with your spouse, civil
partner or cohabitant, legally the total amount in the account is owned by
each of you. Therefore it can be assessed in full against each of you.
However, if you are both getting means-tested payments it will be assessed on
a shared basis or against only one of you.

###  Blind Pension and State Pension (Non-Contributory)

For Blind Pension and State Pension (Non-Contributory) your means are taken to
be **half** of the total means of yourself and your spouse, civil partner or
cohabitant.

In the means test, all your sources of income are added together and 50% of
the total is taken to be your means. When assessing your means from capital
your combined capital is halved and this lower amount is assessed using the
standard formula. The resulting amount is then doubled before being added to
your other sources of income.

**Capital** |  **Weekly means assessed**  
---|---  
First €20,000  |  Nil   
Next €10,000  |  €1 per €1,000   
Next €10,000  |  €2 per €1,000   
Balance  |  €4 per €1,000   
**Example of assessment of means from capital**  
---  
John is employed and has €30,000 savings and his wife Mary has €10,000
savings. They also have a joint account with €10,000. Mary has applied for
Blind Pension. Her means from capital is assessed as follows:  €30,000 +
€10,000 + €10,000 = €50,000  €50,000 ÷ 2 = €25,000  €25,000 assessed using the
formula above = €5  Mary's weekly means from capital is €5  Mary and John's
means from capital as a couple is €10 (€5 x 2)  This amount (€10) is then
added to any other means of the couple (e.g. John's wages)  (At the end of the
means calculation all Mary and John's sources of income will be added together
to get the couple's total means. This figure will then be halved to get Mary's
weekly means.)  
  
##  Carer's Allowance

For Carer's Allowance your means are taken to be **half** of the total means
of yourself and your spouse, civil partner or cohabitant.

In the means test, all your sources of income are added together and 50% of
the total is taken to be your means. When assessing your means from capital
your combined capital is halved and this lower amount is assessed using the
standard formula. The resulting amount is then doubled before being added to
your other sources of income.

**Capital** |  **Weekly means assessed**  
---|---  
First €50,000  |  Nil   
Next €10,000  |  €1 per €1,000   
Next €10,000  |  €2 per €1,000   
Balance  |  €4 per €1,000   
  
###  Jobseeker's Allowance, Disability Allowance or Farm Assist

For Jobseeker's Allowance, Disability Allowance, Pre-Retirement Allowance or
Farm Assist your means are assessed against the maximum household payment for
your circumstances. Your spouse, civil partner or cohabitant and any dependant
children you may have, are included to find the maximum household payment.
Even if your spouse, civil partner or cohabitant is not dependent on you and
has income in his or her own right, any assessable income they may have is
subtracted from the maximum weekly rate of payment for your circumstances.

For example, if you are married and have two children under 12 years of age
and apply for JA, the maximum family payment you could get is €450 (this
figure is made up of personal rate of €220 plus a qualified adult rate of €146
and two qualified child increases of €42). Any assessable income you or your
spouse has is deducted from this family payment. (Income from some sources is
not assessed and there are disregards for income from employment, see our
document, [ Work and Jobseeker's Allowance ](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-
welfare-system/means-test-for-social-welfare-payments/work-and-jobseekers-
allowance/) for more information.)

However if your spouse, civil partner or cohabitant has a social welfare
payment in their own right (with some exceptions such as Child Benefit,
Domiciliary Care Allowance, and Supplementary Welfare Allowance) you _cannot_
claim an Increase for a Qualified Adult (IQA) for them. This means you are
paid as a single person plus a half-rate increase for each qualified child.
(Your spouse, civil partner or cohabitant will get a half-rate increase for
each qualified child with their payment.) In this case, half of your combined
means are taken into account in the means test.

####  Jobseeker's Allowance

**Community Employment:** If you are getting Jobseeker's Allowance and your
spouse, civil partner or cohabitant start a Community Employment (CE) Scheme
in 2023, you _cannot_ claim an IQA for them. This means you are paid as a
single person plus a full-rate increase for each qualified child. In this
case, half of your combined means are taken into account in the means test. If
your spouse, civil partner or cohabitant started their CE Scheme before 2023,
it is [ assessed as part-time work ](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-
system/means-test-for-social-welfare-payments/work-and-jobseekers-allowance/)
.

**Maximum payment to a couple:** Note that if you are getting Jobseeker's
Allowance and your spouse, civil partner or cohabitant is getting one of the
social welfare payments listed below, the total amount paid to you as a couple
cannot be more than the maximum amount that would be paid to one person
(including adult and child dependants) on one social welfare payment. You can
choose which payment is most advantageous.

  * Illness Benefit 
  * Disablement Pension (when paid with Illness Benefit or Incapacity Supplement) 
  * Injury Benefit 
  * Invalidity Pension 
  * State Pension (Non-Contributory) 
  * State Pension (Contributory) 
  * State Pension (Transition) 
  * Jobseeker's Benefit 
  * Jobseeker's Allowance 
  * Farm Assist (FA)

Jobseeker's Allowance ](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/means-
