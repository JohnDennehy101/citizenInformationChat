  * Introduction 
  * Human rights issues 
  * Equality and discrimination 
  * How to apply 
  * Where to apply 

##  Introduction

The Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission is an independent body set up
under the [ Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission Act 2014
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2014/en/act/pub/0025/index.html) on 1
November 2014. Under the Act, the Equality Authority and the Irish Human
Rights Commission were dissolved and their functions transferred to the Irish
Human Rights and Equality Commission.

The functions of the Commission are to:

  * Promote and protect human rights and equality 
  * Encourage the development of a culture of respect for human rights, equality, and intercultural understanding in the State 
  * Promote understanding and awareness of the importance of human rights and equality in the State 
  * Encourage good practice in intercultural relations, to promote tolerance and acceptance of diversity in the State and respect for the freedom and dignity of each person 
  * Work towards the elimination of human rights abuses, discrimination and prohibited conduct 

The Commission carries out these functions by:

  * Providing information to the public in relation to human rights and equality generally 
  * Keeping under review the adequacy and effectiveness of law and practice in the State relating to human rights and equality 
  * Making recommendations to Government on measures to strengthen, protect and uphold human rights and equality in the State 
  * Examining any legislative proposal and report its views on any implications for human rights or equality 
  * Providing legal assistance to people taking legal proceeding to vindicate their rights (this is subject to certain conditions) 
  * Taking legal proceedings to vindicate human rights in the State 
  * Consulting with relevant national and international bodies around human rights or equality issues 
  * Providing or assisting in the provision of education and training on human rights and equality issues 
  * Carrying out equality reviews and preparing equality action plans 
  * Conducting inquiries into possible violation of human rights or equality of treatment obligations in the State 
  * Participating in the Joint Committee of Representatives of members of the Commission and members of the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission 

##  Human rights issues

The Commission can assist you to further [ human rights issues
](http://www.ihrec.ie/your-rights/what-are-human-rights.html) by assisting you
with legal proceedings.

You must have made reasonable efforts to get legal assistance elsewhere, for
example, [ civil legal aid ](/en/justice/legal-aid-and-advice/civil-legal-
advice-and-legal-aid/) or [ criminal legal aid ](/en/justice/legal-aid-and-
advice/criminal-legal-aid/)

The Commission is not an adjudicator body in respect of complaints of human
rights violations in Ireland. It cannot offer remedies or compensation in
cases where human rights have been violated. It cannot overturn court, or
tribunal decisions, or require government departments to give entitlements to
people who may feel they have an entitlement.

Contact the Commission for more information about how requests for legal
assistance are assessed.

##  Equality and discrimination

There are 2 distinct pieces of legislation in place which set out equality
rights for people and specifically outlaw discrimination when it occurs. The [
Employment Equality Acts 1998–2015
](http://revisedacts.lawreform.ie/eli/1998/act/21/revised/en/html) and the [
Equal Status Acts 2000–2015
](http://revisedacts.lawreform.ie/eli/2000/act/8/revised/en/html) outlaw
discrimination in employment, vocational training, advertising, collective
agreements, the provision of goods and services. Specifically, goods and
services include professional or trade services; health services; access to
accommodation and education; facilities for banking, transport and cultural
activities.

Under equality legislation discrimination based on any one of the following
distinct grounds is unlawful. These grounds are:

  * Gender 
  * Civil status 
  * Family status 
  * Sexual orientation 
  * Religion 
  * Age (does not apply to a person under 18) 
  * Disability 
  * Race 
  * Membership of the Traveller community 

Since 1 January 2016, under the Equal Status Acts 2000–2015, you cannot be
discriminated against when renting because you are getting Rent Supplement or
any other social welfare payment, or a Housing Assistance Payment. This is
known as the housing assistance ground.

###  What is discrimination?

Discrimination is defined as less favourable treatment. A person is said to be
discriminated against if they are treated less favourably than another is, has
been or would be treated in a comparable situation on any of the grounds
mentioned above. To establish direct discrimination, a direct comparison must
be made, for example, in the case of disability discrimination the comparison
must be between a person who has a disability and another who has not, or
between persons with different disabilities.

Indirect discrimination occurs when practices or policies that do not appear
to discriminate against one group more than another actually have a
discriminatory impact. It can also happen where a requirement that may appear
non-discriminatory.

##  How to apply

Complaints under the Employment Equality Acts 1998-2015 must be brought within
6 months of the last act of discrimination. However, this period can be
extended to 12 months if you have a valid reason for the delay. You can make a
complaint to the [ Workplace Relations Commission
](/en/employment/enforcement-and-redress/workplace-relations-commission/)
using the online complaint form on [ workplacerelations.ie
](https://www.workplacerelations.ie/en/Complaints_Disputes/Refer_a_Dispute_Make_a_Complaint/)
.

To make a complaint under the Equal Status Acts 2000-2015 you must first
notify the person or organisation you are making the complaint against within
2 months of the last act of discrimination. Again, an extension can be
granted. If you are not satisfied with the service provider's response, or if
they have made no response within 1 month from the date you notified them, you
can bring a complaint to the Workplace Relations Commission within 6 months of
the last act of discrimination.

You can read more information in our document, [ Disputes about equality and
discrimination ](/en/employment/enforcement-and-redress/disputes-about-
equality-and-discrimination/) .
