##  What are special educational needs?

You are a person with special educational needs if your ability to take part
in, and benefit from, education is restricted, due to an ongoing physical,
sensory, mental health or learning disability.

Not all children with disabilities have special educational needs.

Some schools use the term ‘additional educational needs (AEN)’ instead of
special educational needs.

##  Special educational needs in schools

Children with special educational needs may be educated in:

  * Mainstream classes in mainstream schools 
  * Special classes in mainstream schools 
  * Special schools 

###  **Mainstream classes**

Many children with disabilities or special needs are in mainstream classes in
mainstream schools. They may get help from learning support and resource
teachers, and care support from [ special needs assistants (SNAs)
](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/2a977-special-needs-assistant-
sna/?referrer=https://www.gov.ie/snahub/) .

Read more about [ supports for children with special education needs in
primary schools ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/education/primary-and-
post-primary-education/going-to-primary-school/special-needs-education-
primary-schools/) and [ post-primary schools.
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/education/primary-and-post-primary-
education/going-to-post-primary-school/post-primary-education-for-students-
with-special-needs/)

###  **Special classes in mainstream schools**

Some children attend special classes in mainstream schools. These classes
generally have low pupil-teacher ratios.

###  **Special schools**

There are around 130 special schools in Ireland. These schools provide for
children with certain types of disability and special needs. They provide
education to people aged 4 to 18.

Special schools generally support students with more complex special
educational needs, where a mainstream school would not be in their best
interest.

You can [ find special schools in your area
](https://experience.arcgis.com/experience/8ea6b6cb351845cfb0ef8b304fdf5b92/page/Special-
Schools/) on the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) website.

###  **Allocation of special education teachers**

Each mainstream school is [ allocated a number of special education teachers
](https://ncse.ie/set-hours-and-sna-allocations) based on:

  * The size of the school, and 
  * Its educational profile 

Schools are given the necessary resources in advance so that students with
special educational needs can be enrolled into schools and access additional
supports. This lets a school be inclusive and create additional teaching
support for students who need it.

Read more about [ how special education teachers are allocated in primary
school ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/education/primary-and-post-
primary-education/going-to-primary-school/special-needs-education-primary-
schools/#a62c1d) and [ post-primary schools
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/education/primary-and-post-primary-
education/going-to-post-primary-school/post-primary-education-for-students-
with-special-needs/#280dde) .

##  Supports for students with special educational needs

###  **Individual education plans**

The [ EPSEN Act 2004
](https://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2004/act/30/section/3/enacted/en/html)
says each child with a special educational need should have an individual
education plan. However, the relevant section of the Act has yet to be
commenced, so there is currently no legal entitlement for students to have
these plans. Some teachers may use their own form of individual education plan
when teaching students with special educational needs.

Read the [ guidelines for the individual education plan process (pdf)
](http://ncse.ie/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/final_report.pdf) from the
National Council for Special Education (NCSE).

###  **School transport for children with special needs**

Children with disabilities who are attending school can access [ special
transport arrangements,
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/education/primary-and-post-primary-
education/going-to-primary-school/school-transport-for-children-with-special-
needs/) including escorts and safety harnesses.

###  **Nursing supports to attend school**

The HSE and NCSE have a pilot scheme to put [ nursing supports in place for
children with complex healthcare needs to attend school
](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/cf321-national-nursing-pilot-for-children-
with-complex-healthcare-needs-pilot-scheme/) .

Parents or guardians who wish to make an application should contact their
child’s school. Schools make the application to the NCSE on behalf of the
child.

Read more about [ applying for the pilot scheme ](https://ncse.ie/national-
nursing-programme-pilot-for-children-with-complex-healthcare-needs) .

###  **Educational Therapy Support Service**

The [ Educational Therapy Support Service (ETSS)
](https://www.gov.ie/en/press-release/7e9c4-ministers-foley-and-naughton-
announce-the-establishment-of-an-educational-therapy-support-service-etss/) is
a new service provided by the NCSE. It is expected to be operational in some
regions from September 2024.

The ETSS will provide occupational therapists, speech and language therapists,
and behaviour practitioners to schools. Therapists will work with teachers in
a classroom to identify any educational needs a student may have, and provide
support.

Schools will apply to the NCSE for access to the ETTS. The application process
is currently being developed.

##  Organisations with a role in special educational needs

###  **National Council for Special Education**

The [ National Council for Special Education (NCSE) ](http://ncse.ie/) works
to improve the delivery of education services to people with special
educational needs. The NCSE is an independent statutory body established by
the Department of Education.

The NCSE gives information to parents and educational institutions on:

  * Best practice for educating children with special educational needs, and 
  * The entitlements of children with special educational needs 

The NCSE also:

  * Plans and co-ordinates the provision of education and support services to children with special educational needs (with schools and the [ Health Service Executive ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/health/health-system/health-service-executive/) ) 
  * Assesses and reviews resources for children with special educational needs 
  * Makes sure that the progress of students with special educational needs is monitored and reviewed 
  * Reviews education provision for adults with disabilities 
  * Consults with voluntary bodies 
  * Advises the Minister for Education on special education matters 
  * Carries out research and publishes findings 
  * Nominates a person to carry out an assessment of education need on behalf of the HSE (see ‘Assessment of Need’ below) 

The Special Education Support Service, the National Behaviour Support Service
and the [ Visiting Teacher Service ](https://ncse.ie/visiting-teacher-support)
moved to the NCSE in 2017. The NCSE support service was set up to provide a
more integrated service to children and their families, as well as to teachers
and schools.

####  **Assessment of Need**

An [ Assessment of Need (AON)
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/health/health-services/health-
services-for-people-with-disabilities/assessment-of-need-for-people-with-
disabilites/) identifies your child’s health needs and which health services
are needed to meet these needs. The assessment is carried out by the HSE for
children or young people with a disability.

If your child has special educational needs, the NCSE nominates an appropriate
person to help the HSE assess these needs.

Under the [ EPSEN Act 2004
](https://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2004/act/30/section/5/enacted/en/html) ,
a nominated person can be:

  * A psychologist 
  * A medical practitioner 
  * The principal of the school that the child attends, or a teacher nominated by that principal 
  * An appropriately qualified social worker 
  * A therapist qualified to provide support services to children with special educational needs 

The nominated person must complete a [ Report of Education Needs (pdf)
](https://ncse.ie/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/NCSE-Guidance-Note-for-
Schools.pdf) , which is sent back to the HSE. It will be considered as part of
the wider AON. Read more about the assessment of educational needs in [
Circular 0025/2024 (pdf)
](https://www.gov.ie/pdf/?file=https://assets.gov.ie/290397/244e7f90-4858-4dc2-98b4-aa99b5a6e4a4.pdf#page=null)

](https://ncse.ie/special-educational-needs-organiser-seno) . SENOs support
the special educational needs of children at a local level.

Your local SENO will:
