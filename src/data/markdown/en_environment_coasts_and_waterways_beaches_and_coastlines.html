#  Beaches and coastlines

  * Visiting the beach 
  * Sea swimming in Ireland 
  * Other beach activities 
  * Wildlife on Irish beaches 
  * Beach and coastline organisations 

##  Visiting the beach

There is no fee to access public beaches in Ireland. You can visit most
beaches in Ireland. However, access to some parts of the coastline may be
privately owned.

###  **Planning your visit to the beach**

If you are planning a visit to the beach, you can [ check if the beach has
been awarded a Blue Flag ](https://beachawards.ie/blue-flag/sites-2-2/) .
Beaches are awarded a blue flag if they have good water quality, safety
facilities and services. [ Read more about Blue Flag beaches
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/travel_and_recreation/sport_and_leisure/blue_flag_beaches_and_marinas_in_ireland.html)
.

##  Sea swimming in Ireland

You can swim in the sea in many places around the Irish coast. It is important
to prepare yourself before swimming by finding out about tides, bathing water
quality and swimming bans before you swim.

You may want to check the local tides as many swimming areas need a high tide
to enjoy swimming there. You can [ read more about the types of tides and
safety around tides ](https://www.swimireland.ie/news/tides-currents-what-
swimmers-need-to-know) .

You can find bathing areas managed by local authorities using the
Environmental Protection Agency’s map on [ beaches.ie
](http://beaches.ie/find-a-beach/#/) .

Swim Ireland also has [ an open swim map
](https://swimspots.meandthewater.ie/) which includes some more swimming areas
that are not managed by local authorities.

###  **Safe sea swimming**

Drowning is a real danger even if you know how to swim. It is important to
learn how to swim before going into the sea. You should also follow some of
these tips for safe sea swimming:

  * Don’t swim alone 
  * Don’t swim just after eating 
  * Don’t swim when you’re tired 
  * Swim parallel and close to the shore 
  * Do what the lifeguard tells you 
  * Obey the signs and flags on the beach 

Also, remember that it is much more dangerous if you are sea swimming in the
winter than in the summer.

If you find yourself in the water unexpectedly or get into difficulty, you
should try to float by following the [ Float to Live steps
](https://rnli.org/safety/float) .

If you see someone in difficulty in the sea:

  1. Call for help - dial 112 and ask for the coast guard or shout for a lifeguard 
  2. Throw them something that floats like a ringbouy that they can hold onto 
  3. Do not go into the water yourself. Too many people drown trying to save others. 

[ Read more about safe swimming in the sea from Water Safety Ireland
](https://watersafety.ie/recreation/#:~:text=Beach%20Safety,a%20life%20jacket)
.

**Ringbouys**

Ringbouys are available at locations where people may be at risk of drowning.
Ringbouys are there to help people who get into difficulty in water. It is an
offence to take or misuse a ringbouy. You can [ report a missing ringbuoy on
watersafety.ie ](https://watersafety.ie/ringbuoys/) .

**Lifeguards**

Lifeguards are at certain beaches on weekends during June, and full time in
July and August. You can [ check which locations have a lifegaurd and at what
times ](https://watersafety.ie/lifeguards/) . It is safer to swim near a
lifeguard. It is important to always do what they tell you.

###  **What do flags mean at the beach?**

When you visit a beach, you’ll see signs with important safety information
about the beach and if it is safe to swim. If the beach has lifeguards, you’ll
also see flags that tell you where it is safe to swim.

  * Red flags only mean do not swim 
  * Between the red and yellow flags is safe to swim 
  * Between black and white checkerboard flags it is safe to surf and windsurf, but not swim 

[ Check the different signs and flags you may see at the beach
](https://rnli.org/safety/beach-safety/flags-and-signs) .

###  **When is it not safe to get into the water?**

  * If you can’t swim 
  * Where there are only red flags 
  * Where there are signs telling you to avoid the water 
  * If there is no lifeguard 
  * If you are swimming alone 
  * In a rip current area 
  * After drinking alcohol or eating food 
  * When it is dark 
  * If you see or hear a storm 

**Rip currents** are dangerous parts of water that can bring you out to sea
very quickly. A rip current often looks like an area of darker water and if
there are waves, they will break on either side, but not directly in the rip.
If you find yourself caught in a rip current, remain calm, swim parallel to
the beach and do not try to swim against the current. If you can’t do this,
raise your arm and shout for a lifeguard. [ Read more about rip currents
](https://rnli.org/safety/know-the-risks/rip-currents) .

Water Safety Ireland has a [ guide to open water swimming.
](https://watersafety.ie/open-water-swimming/) If you are swimming in water
colder than 15 C you can read about how to avoid [ the dangers of cold water
hypothermia ](https://watersafety.ie/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Hypothermia-
Leaflet-2021.pdf) . You can check the [ current temperature of the sea
](https://www.irishlights.ie/technology-data-services/metocean-charts.aspx)
and the [ forecasted sea temperature ](https://www.met.ie/forecasts/marine-
inland-lakes/sea-surface-temperature) in your area.

###  **Bathing water quality**

Your local authority tests the water at identified bathing areas every month
during the bathing season, which runs from 1 June to 15 September each year.

Some local authorities test the water more often to make sure it is safe to
swim in. You can see the results of the yearly water quality tests as well as
the tests during the bathing season at or on [ your local authority website
](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/942f74-local-authorities/) .

Sometimes, a local authority will restrict swimming in a bathing area because
the water quality is polluted, or the conditions are unsafe.

You should not swim or take part in recreational water activities for at least
48 hours after heavy rainfall to prevent the risk of getting sick.
Contamination of bathing water from sewage can happen after heavy rainfall and
this can make you sick. This 48-hour rule applies even if the local authority
website shows that the water is safe, as the sample used to determine this may
be a few days or weeks old.

##  Other beach activities

###  **Coastal walks**

There are many coastal walks in Ireland. Before going for your walk, always
check the weather forecast for any weather warnings. Check the time of the
tides to avoid becoming stranded because of tides. Have a charged phone so you
can call for help if you get stranded, injured or need help.

Visit for walks around lakes, canals and rivers. [ Read more about walking and
rambling in Ireland
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/travel_and_recreation/sport_and_leisure/walking_and_rambling_in_ireland.html)
.

You can find information on beaches, cliff walks and coastal walks along the
west coast of Ireland on the [ Wild Atlantic Way website
](https://www.thewildatlanticway.com/discover-tourist-attractions/) .

You can [ check if the beach you are visiting has a Green Coast Award
](https://beachawards.ie/green-coast/sites/) . The award is for beaches which
have excellent water quality and environment.

###  **Going out to sea on a boat**

If you are in danger on a boat and it has a radio you can use channel 16 to
tell the operator your location. If you do not have a radio, use your phone to
call 112 or 999 and ask for the Coast Guard.

If you are mooring a boat or other sea vessel on the Irish coast, you need
permission with a lease or license. [ Find out how to get a foreshore lease or
licence ](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/4ddcf-foreshore-your-questions-
answered/#how-you-can-apply-for-a-foreshore-lease-or-licence) .

There are lots of other water sports you can enjoy around Ireland, such as
surfing, kite-surfing, paddling boarding, canoeing.

Water Safety Ireland’s has a [ safe surfing tips poster
](http://watersafety.ie/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Surf-Poster.pdf) with
information on how to stay safe when surfing. You can also read a guide to [
safe kite-surfing. ](https://watersafety.ie/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Kite-
Surfing-Guidelines-July-2020.pdf)

###  **Can I walk my dog on a beach in Ireland?**

Not all beaches are dog-friendly and some may have restrictions. Some beaches
may:

  * Allow dogs at certain times only 
  * Allow dogs which are kept on leads 
  * Not allow dogs at any time 

You should check the beach’s [ local authority website
](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/942f74-local-authorities/) before visiting
to check if there are any restrictions in place.

Dogs are not allowed on some Blue Flag beach areas during the bathing season,
which runs from 1 June to 15 September each year). This is because bathing
water can be contaminated by dog poo. Put your dog poo in the bin when you are
at the beach. If you cannot find a public bin or it is full, bring your litter
home.

You have to keep your dog under control on nearby parking areas, walkways and
promenades in the beach area. Read more about the [ rules around
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/environment/pets_and_wildlife/control_of_dogs.html#l25d88)
owning a dog.

Some local authorities allow dogs on Blue Flag beaches at certain times. You
can check the rules about dogs on the beach and other beach bye-laws on [ your
local authority’s website ](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/942f74-local-
authorities/) .

##  Wildlife on Irish beaches

You cannot take natural items you find on beaches in Ireland. This includes
sand, shells or seaweed. You need [ a foreshore license to harvest seaweed
](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/4ddcf-foreshore-your-questions-
answered/#is-a-foreshore-consent-required-for-seaweed-harvesting) on beaches
in Ireland.

**Jellyfish**

Jellyfish are swimming sea animals with an umbrella-shaped bell and trailing
tentacles that sting. Jellyfish stings can be painful, but most are not
emergencies in Ireland. With a typical sting, you may have:

  * Pain 
  * Red marks 
  * Itching 
  * Numbness 
  * Tingling 

Check the [ Jellyfish Identifying card (pdf) ](https://watersafety.ie/wp-
content/uploads/2017/12/jellyfish-id-card.pdf) and read about [ how to treat a
jelly-fish sting ](https://www.beaches.ie/how-to-handle-a-jellyfish-sting/) .

**Venomous weever fish**

Venomous weever fish are small fish that are usually buried under the sand on
Irish beaches where the water is shallow. If you step on a weever fish, it’s
sting can be extremely painful. It usually does not cause permanent damage.

Weever fish are difficult to see. Try to avoid being stung by not swimming 1
to 2 hours before and after low water and wearing footwear if you are walking
or swimming on the beach near low water. [ Read more about venomous weever
fish and how to treat a sting ](https://watersafety.ie/recreation/) .

**Seals**

If you see a seal on the beach, stay at a distance from it and do not feed it.
Avoid swimming in the water if they are close to your bathing area. If you are
on a boat, you should not feed seals, as a large grey seal could capsize a
small boat. If you find a stranded, injured or entangled seal [ contact Seal
Rescue Ireland ](https://www.sealrescueireland.org/) .

**Beached sea-animals**

If you find a stranded, injured or entangled whale, porpoise or dolphin you
can call the [ ORCA Ireland ](https://www.orcaireland.org/) helpline. Make
sure to give them as much information as possible about the animal’s location
and condition. Keep away from the animal and make sure that your dog is on a
lead.

**Other wildlife**

Some beaches have areas where wildlife is protected. Look out for signs asking
you to keep out of certain areas. There are birds that nest on the ground and
are at risk from people and dogs. You should keep your dog on a lead on these
beaches during nesting season, which is between March and August.
