#  When do clocks change in Ireland?

  * Winter time and summer time 
  * When do clocks go forward? 
  * When do clocks go back? 
  * Proposed changes to summer and winter time 

##  Winter time and summer time

Every winter, clocks go back one hour. They go forward one hour in spring. The
clocks change at the same time in the EU.

Ireland has the same time as the UK and Portugal. This is one hour behind
Central European Time, which is used in most of the EU.

##  When do clocks go forward?

Clocks go forward by one hour at 1am on the last Sunday of March. This means,
at 1am the time on the clock is changed to 2am.

Date clocks go forward in Ireland:

  * 31 March 2024 
  * 30 March 2025 
  * 29 March 2026 

##  When do clocks go back?

Clocks go back by one hour at 2am on the last Sunday in October. This means,
at 2am the time on the clock is changed to 1am.

Dates clocks go back in Ireland:

  * 27 October 2024 
  * 26 October 2025 
  * 25 October 2026 

##  Proposed changes to summer and winter time

In 2019, the [ European Parliament ](/en/government-in-ireland/european-
government/eu-institutions/european-parliament/) voted in favour of ending
these seasonal time changes. EU institutions have not made progress on
implementing the decision, and the [ European Commission ](/en/government-in-
ireland/european-government/eu-institutions/european-commission/) has said
that it does not plan to submit a new proposal on the matter to the
Parliament. This means that no changes are expected to summer and winter time
in the coming years.
