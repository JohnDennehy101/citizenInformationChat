##  Introduction

If you spent time in a mother and baby home or country home institution in
Ireland, you may be entitled to financial payments and health supports under
the Mother and Baby Institutions Payment Scheme.

The scheme aims to acknowledge the suffering and improve the circumstances of
[ former residents of mother and baby and county home institutions
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/birth-family-relationships/adoption-
and-fostering/mother-and-baby-homes/) .

##  Mother and Baby Institutions Payment Scheme

You can apply for the Mother and Baby Institutions Payment Scheme from 20
March 2024.

There are 3 benefits available under the scheme:

  1. A general payment 
  2. A work-related payment 
  3. Health supports 

##  Checking if you are eligible

To be eligible for benefits under the scheme, you need to have spent a certain
amount of time in one (or more) of the [ Institutions covered by the scheme
](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/a65d8-institutions-covered-by-the-payment-
scheme/) .

The institutions covered by the scheme are divided into 2 lists referred to as
Table 1 and Table 2. You must have entered the institution on or before 31
December of the concluding year set out in Table 1 and Table 2.

**If you already received a court settlement**

If you have received a court settlement for time you spent in an
institution(s) you can't apply for a general payment or work-related payment
for the same period. However, you may still be eligible for health supports.

**If the institution isn’t included in the scheme**

If the institution you spent time in is not on Table 1 or Table 2, then the
institution is not included in the scheme and you are not eligible.

###  Eligibility for a general payment

You are eligible for a general payment if you were in one of [ the
institutions listed in Table 1 or Table 2
](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/a65d8-institutions-covered-by-the-payment-
scheme/) and:

  * As a mother, you were there for at least one night, for reasons relating to your pregnancy, or the birth or care of your child 
  * As a child, you were there for at least 180 days 

The Payment Scheme Office will use the information provided in the application
form to search the institutional records available to check this.

You can find information on the [ general payment rates for time spent in a
listed institution (pdf)

.

###  Eligibility for a work-related payment

You are eligible for a work-related payment if you were in any of the [
institutions listed in Table 1
](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/a65d8-institutions-covered-by-the-payment-
scheme/) for more than 90 days for reasons relating to pregnancy, or the birth
or care of your child.

.

###  Eligibility for health supports

You are eligible for health supports if you spent 180 days or more in any of
the institutions listed in Table 1 or Table 2 of the institutions covered by
the cheme. These health supports are either:

  * An [ enhanced medical card ](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/bed53-mother-and-baby-institutions-payment-scheme-your-questions-answered/#what-are-people-entitled-to-under-the-mother-and-baby-institutions-payment-scheme) , or 
  * For people living outside of Ireland only, a health support payment valued at €3,000, instead of the enhanced medical card 

You are not entitled to any health supports if you have already received
health supports under the [ Magdalen Restorative Justice Ex Gratia Scheme
](https://www.gov.ie/en/service/8fe41a-the-magdalen-restorative-justice-ex-
gratia-scheme/) .

Office through the online portal. If you apply by post, you will receive these
communications by registered post.

If you need help completing the application form, contact the [ Payment Scheme
Office ](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/f5049-contact-us/) or your local [
Citizens Information Centre ](https://centres.citizensinformation.ie/) for

##  Who can complete the application form?

You can fill in the application form:

  * On your own behalf, or with help from a [ Decision-Making Assistant ](/en/health/legal-matters-and-health/decision-making-assistance-agreement/) or [ Co-Decision Maker ](/en/health/legal-matters-and-health/co-decision-making-agreement/) (if you have a formal arrangement in place which covers this scheme) 
  * As a support person who has a formal arrangement in place to act on behalf of someone who may be eligible for the scheme 
  * As a personal representative, [ on behalf of the estate of a person who died on or after 13 January 2021 ](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/bed53-mother-and-baby-institutions-payment-scheme-your-questions-answered/#can-i-apply-to-the-mother-and-baby-institutions-payment-scheme-on-behalf-of-someone-who-has-died)

###  What information will I have to provide?

The online application form is slightly different to the paper application
form, which is divided into 5 sections, but you need to provide the same
information on both.

  * **Section 1**   
This section is for the contact details of the person completing the form. You
have to indicate what capacity you are completing the form in, for example,
for yourself, or as a support person.

  * **Section 2**   
This section requires the details of the person who spent time in one (or
more) of the [ Institutions covered by the Scheme
](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/a65d8-institutions-covered-by-the-payment-
scheme/) . You need to know the name of the institution and, if you can, the
estimated arrival and departure dates. If you do not know the name of the
institution, you can use the [ Birth Information and Tracing Service
](https://www.birthinfo.ie/) .

  * **Section 3**   
In Section 3, you have to say what benefits you are applying for. You can
apply for just one benefit, for two, or for all three, subject to the amount
of time spent in the institution or institutions.  
  
You also need to confirm if you, or the person you are applying for:  
\- Ever received a court settlement for the same time period in the
institution or  
institutions that is being applied for  
\- Currently has a medical card under the Magdalen Restorative Justice Ex-
Gratia  
Scheme

  * **Section 4  
** Section 4 has checklists of the supporting documentation that must be
provided with the application. This depends on who is making the application,
for example, if you are applying on your own behalf, or if you are applying on
behalf of a person who is deceased. You do not need to include any records
showing time spent in an institution.  
  
Everyone applying to the scheme must provide certified photo ID (passport,
driving licence or Public Services Card/National Security Card).  
  
At this stage in the process, you can also indicate if you need your
application to be prioritised because you are terminally ill. The Payment
Scheme Office will require a short letter from your medical practitioner to
confirm this.  
  
**I am a personal representative applying on behalf of someone who is deceased  
** If you are applying on behalf of someone who is deceased, you need to
include a copy of the death certificate and an additional proof of your right
to act on behalf of the deceased’s estate, such as a certified Letter of
Administration or Grant of Probate. Further details of the documentation
needed if you are making an application on behalf of someone who is deceased
is available at [ gov.ie ](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/bed53-mother-and-
baby-institutions-payment-scheme-your-questions-answered/#can-i-apply-to-the-
mother-and-baby-institutions-payment-scheme-on-behalf-of-someone-who-has-died)
.  

  * **Section 5**   
This section contains the declaration and signature.

###  What do I do when I have completed the application form?

When you have completed the application form, you should:

  * Upload your required supporting documents onto the portal and submit the form (if completed online), or 
  * Send the completed form and any other required supporting documents to Payment Scheme Office, PO Box 13668, Waterford, Ireland 

If you are having any difficulties scanning or photocopying your supporting
documents, contact the Payment Scheme Office on +353 1 522 9992 and they will
assist you.

##  Can I apply if I live abroad?

If you are living abroad, you can apply in the same way as someone living in
Ireland – that is, using the [ online application portal
](https://www.paymentscheme.ie/en-US/) or [ by post if you prefer to use a
paper form ](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/685bd-how-to-apply-to-the-
payment-scheme/) .

Or you can call +353 1 522 9992 or contact your local embassy or consulate to
receive a paper copy of the form. You can find [ a list of Irish embassies and
consulates ](https://www.ireland.ie/en/dfa/embassies/) on the Department of
Foreign Affairs website.

Regardless of where you are living, the financial payments from this scheme
are awarded in the same way.

The services available through the enhanced medical card cannot be used
outside of Ireland. So, if you live abroad, you can apply for a health support
payment valued at €3,000, instead of the enhanced medical card. If you live
outside Ireland and still wish to receive an enhanced medical card (in case
you return to Ireland either temporarily or permanently) you will need a
Personal Public Service number (PPS). To benefit from the services offered by
the enhanced medical card, you must be registered with a GP in Ireland.

##  What happens after I submit my application?

  1. When your application is received by the Payment Scheme Office it is given an Application Reference Number. 
  2. The Payment Scheme Office checks your application to make sure all necessary information is filled in, and other necessary documents are included. 
  3. The Payment Scheme Office lets you know they have received your application and gives you the Application Reference Number, which you should use if you need to contact them about your application. 
  4. Your completed application is placed in a queue. Applications are prioritised by age. If the applicant is terminally ill, the application is placed in a separate priority queue. 
  5. Based on the information provided in the application form, the Payment Scheme Office looks for your records in all the databases available, and confirm the time spent in the named institution(s). 
  6. The Payment Scheme Office calculates if you are entitled to any benefit under the Payment Scheme. 
  7. The Payment Scheme Office sends you a document called a Notice of Determination. 

###  Notice of Determination

The Notice of Determination outlines the decision about your application and
any offer being made to you.

When you receive the Notice of Determination, you should read it carefully.
You can take up to 6 months to consider and accept or reject the benefit
outlined in the document.

###  Signing a legal waiver for payments

If you decide to accept a general or work-related payment under the scheme,
you will have to sign a legal waiver.

By signing the legal waiver, you agree that you will not take any further
action against the state related to your experience.

Signing a waiver will not stop you from discussing the payment you have
received from the scheme, if that is your wish.

To help you to decide if you want to take the payment and sign the waiver, you
can get financial support of €500 (ex VAT) for independent legal advice.

You have to pay for legal advice but the Payment Scheme Office will reimburse
you by bank transfer if you send them a copy of an invoice or receipt from a
solicitor for the advice.

####  Payments

After you return your acceptance form, and your signed legal waiver (if
applicable), the Payment Scheme Office will arrange to pay you by bank
transfer as soon as possible.

For people living in Ireland, payments awarded through the Payment Scheme will
not be included if your means are assessed:

  * For social welfare means tested payments 
  * For a [ medical card ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/health/medical-cards-and-gp-visit-cards/medical-card/) or a [ GP visit card ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/health/medical-cards-and-gp-visit-cards/gp-visit-cards/)
  * Under the [ Fair Deal Scheme ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/health/health-services/health-services-for-older-people/fair-deal-scheme/)

####  Enhanced medical card

If you have been offered and accepted an enhanced medical card, the HSE will
contact you directly about it.

##  Requesting a review

If you are not happy with the decision in the Notice of Determination, you can
request a review. You need to do this within 60 days of receiving it.

You need to complete a Review Request Form and return it with the reasons you
are requesting the review.

You can upload your completed form, along with any supporting information
using the online portal, or send it by post to Payment Scheme Office. Your
request must be acknowledged within 28 days.

When the review is completed, you will receive a Review Notice of
Determination and information on how to accept the benefits, if applicable.

###  Making an appeal

When you get the Review Notice of Determination, you will also get information
on your right to seek an independent appeal of this decision within 60 days. A
member of an independent panel of appeals officers carry out the appeal.

The decision of the appeals officer is final. However, this may be appealed to
the High Court, by either you, or the Appeals Office, on a point of law. This
must be done within 28 days.
