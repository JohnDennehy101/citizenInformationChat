##  Introduction

Budget 2018 was announced on 10 October 2017.

This document sets out the main changes in the areas of taxation, social
welfare, health, housing, education, employment and other areas. It is an
overview and not a complete statement of the measures announced in Budget
2018\.

**This document will be updated as more details become available.**

Some of the changes announced in the Budget come into effect immediately.
Others take effect from the beginning of January 2018 or later in 2018. Many
others have to be finalised before coming into effect.

Some elements of these measures may change when the legislation required to
bring them into effect is enacted.

For a full list of the Budget changes that were announced, please see the
Department of Finance and Department of Public Expenditure and Reform website,
[ budget.gov.ie ](http://budget.gov.ie) .

##  Taxation

###  Income tax

The **standard rate income tax band** for all earners is increasing by €750.
This means, for example, an increase from €33,800 to €34,550 for single
individuals and from €42,800 to €43,550 for married one-earner couples
(January 2018).

The **Home Carer Tax Credit** will increase from €1,100 to €1,200 (January
2018).

The **Earned Income Tax Credit** will increase from €950 to €1,150. This is
relevant for taxpayers earning self-employed trading or professional income in
certain cases and for business owner/managers who are ineligible for a PAYE
credit on their salary income (January 2018).

**Mortgage interest relief** is being extended for remaining recipients (owner
occupiers who took out qualifying mortgages between 2004 and 2012) on a
tapered basis. 75% of the existing 2017 relief will be continued into 2018,
50% into 2019 and 25% into 2020. The relief will cease entirely from 2021\.

###  Universal Social Charge (USC)

Incomes of €13,000 or less will continue to be exempt from USC in 2018. Once
your income is over this limit, you will pay the relevant rate of USC on all
of your income as follows:

  * €0 to €12,012 @ 0.5% 
  * €12,012 to €19,372 @ 2% 
  * €19,372 to €70,044 @ 4.75% 
  * €70,044+ @ 8% 

Medical card holders and individuals aged 70 years and older whose aggregate
income does not exceed €60,000 will now pay a maximum USC rate of 2% (January
2018).

###  Excise Duties

####  Tobacco Products Tax

The excise duty on a packet of 20 cigarettes increased by 50 cents (including
VAT) with a pro-rata increase on other tobacco products, and an additional 25
cents on roll-your-own tobacco. This took effect from midnight on 10 October
2017.

####  Sugar Tax

A tax on sugar sweetened drinks is to be introduced on 1 April 2018. The tax
will apply to sugar sweetened drinks with a sugar content between 5 grams and
8 grams per 100ml at a rate of 20c per litre. A second rate will apply for
drinks with a sugar content of 8 grams or above at 30c per litre.

####  Benefit in Kind on Electric Vehicles

A 0% benefit-in-kind (BIK) rate is being introduced for electric vehicles for
a period of 1 year. This will allow for a comprehensive review of benefit in
kind on vehicles which will inform decisions for the next Budget. Electricity
used in the workplace for charging vehicles will also be exempt from benefit-
in-kind (1 January 2018 to 31 December 2018).

##  Social Welfare

The total social protection budget in 2018 will be €20 billion.

###  Increases in social welfare payments

**Weekly social welfare payments** will increase by €5 per week with
proportional increases for qualified adults and those on reduced rates of
payment (see rates table below). This also applies to employment programmes
such as Community Employment (CE), Tús and the Rural Social Scheme (from week
beginning 26 March 2018).

Those aged 26 and under who are getting a reduced rate of **Jobseeker’s
Allowance** will receive the full €5 increase (from week beginning 26 March
2018).

The weekly rate for a **qualified child** will increase by €2 from €29.80 to
€31.80 (from week beginning 26 March 2018).

**State Pensions** will increase by €5 per week with proportional increases
for qualified adults and those on reduced rates of payment (from week
beginning 26 March 2018).

###  Working Family Payment

Working Family Payment (formerly called Family Income Supplement) income
thresholds will increase by €10 for families with up to 3 children (from week
beginning 26 March 2018).

###  Back to Work Family Dividend

The Back to Work Family Dividend scheme which aims to support families to move
from social welfare to employment, and which was due to end on 31 March 2018,
will now be retained.

###  Fuel Allowance

The Fuel Allowance season will be extended by 1 week, from 26 to 27 weeks,
into the first week of April 2018.

###  Free Travel Scheme

An additional €10 million in funding is being provided towards the Free Travel
Scheme.

###  Christmas Bonus

long-term social welfare payment (minimum payment of €20).

###  Telephone Support Allowance

A new Telephone Support Allowance at a weekly rate of €2.50 will be introduced
for those getting the Living Alone Allowance and who are eligible for the Fuel
Allowance (June 2018).

##  Housing, Employment and Business, Education and Childcare

###  Housing

A total of €1.83 billion is allocated to the Department of Housing, Planning
and Local Government for housing in 2017.

####  Social housing support

An increase of €31 million has been allocated to the **Social Housing Current
Expenditure Programme** , bringing the total to €115 million. Local
authorities and approved housing bodies are to build approximately 3,800 new
social houses in 2018.

From 2019, an extra €500 million will be provided for the **direct building
programme** , to build an additional 3,000 social houses by 2021\.

Funding for the **Housing Assistance Payment (HAP)** scheme is increasing by
€149 million to €301 million. This will provide for an additional 17,000
households to be accommodated under HAP in 2018 and support the nationwide
rollout of the HAP Place Finder Service for people who are in emergency
accommodation.

Funding of €134 million is allocated to the **Rental Accommodation Scheme
(RAS)** to provide for an additional 600 new transfers under the scheme, as
well as the ongoing cost of households already supported under RAS.

Funding of €32 million is allocated for the **Repair and Leasing Scheme** ,
which is expected to deliver 800 vacant properties for social housing.

Funding of €12 million is allocated for a range of **Traveller-specific
accommodation schemes** , to deliver 110 homes in 2018.

The **energy efficiency programme for social homes** receives funding of €25
million to improve a further 9,000 homes.

####  Supports for homeless people

The current allocation for **homelessness services** is increased by €18
million, to over €116 million.

It is intended that there will be 3,000 exits from homelessness in 2018.

As part of the development of the **Family Hubs programme** , 6 new facilities
are due to become operational by the end of 2017. An additional €18 million is
provided for this programme in 2018.

####  People in mortgage arrears

An extra €5 million is provided for the **mortgage to rent scheme** , bringing
its funding to €22 million for 2018.

####  Housing tax reliefs

**Mortgage Interest Relief** , which only applies to mortgages taken out by 31
December 2012, was due to end on 31 December 2017. It will now be retained, on
a tapered basis, for remaining recipients – owner occupiers who took out
qualifying mortgages between 2004 and 2012. 75% of the existing 2017 relief
will be continued into 2018, 50% into 2019 and 25% into 2020. The relief will
cease entirely from 2021.

A gradual reduction in **Rent Tax Relief** was announced in Budget 2011. From
2018 onwards, this relief will no longer be available.

####  Housing finance

Up to €750 million of the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund is being made
available for **commercial investment in housing finance** . These funds will
be made available to a new entity, to be known as Home Building Finance
Ireland (HBFI), which will increase the availability of debt funding on market
terms to commercially viable residential development projects.

####  Measures to encourage supply of land for housing

A new scheme is being introduced to refund **stamp duty** on property
transactions in respect of commercial land bought for the development of
housing. To avail of the refund scheme, developers will have to start the
relevant development within 30 months of buying the land.

A **Vacant Site Levy** will be charged from 2019 on lands that are suitable
for housing but are not being developed. A levy of 3% will apply in 2019, as
already planned. The rate will now increase to 7% in the second and subsequent
years.

At present, property owners can get full relief from **Capital Gains Tax** if
they retain qualifying assets for 7 years. This period is being reduced to 4
years.

A new, time-limited **tax deduction for pre-letting expenses** is being
introduced to encourage owners of vacant residential property to bring it into
the rental market for a minimum period of 4 years. The property must have been
vacant for at least 12 months to qualify. A cap on allowable expenses of
€5,000 per property will apply. This relief will be available for qualifying
expenses incurred up to the end of 2021. It will be subject to clawback if the
property is withdrawn from the rental market within 4 years.

####  Affordability

An Exchequer allocation of €75 million is provided for a second phase of the
**Local Infrastructure Housing Activation Fund** , which accelerates the
provision of public infrastructure to support the development of sites for
private housing in urban areas. The fund will also support the delivery of
affordable housing on land owned by local authorities, using co-operative
housing and similar models.

####  Remediation, adaptations and regeneration

Funding of €30 million is allocated for the **remediation of a further 430
houses affected by pyrite** .

Funding for **housing adaptation grants** is increased to €53 million to
enable up to 11,000 home adaptations for people with disabilities and older
people.

The **National Regeneration programme** will receive funding of €61 million.

####  Private rented housing

The **Residential Tenancies Board (RTB)** receives €7 million in funding to
reflect its expanded role and commitments under the Strategy for the Rental
Sector, including increased inspections of rented accommodation.

###  Employment and Business

####  National Minimum Wage

The national minimum wage will increase from €9.25 per hour to €9.55 per hour
(from 1 January 2018).

####  Key Employee Engagement Programme (KEEP)

An incentive is being introduced to facilitate the use of share-based
remuneration by small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to attract key
employees. Gains arising to employees on the exercise of KEEP share options
will be liable to Capital Gains Tax on disposal of the shares, in place of the
current liability to income tax, Universal Social Charge (USC) and Pay Related
Social Insurance (PRSI) on exercise. This incentive will be available for
qualifying share options granted between 1 January 2018 and 31 December 2023\.
