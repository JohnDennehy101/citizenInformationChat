##  What is statutory redundancy pay?

Where you lose your job because your employer is closing the business or
reducing staff numbers, this is known as [ redundancy
](/en/employment/unemployment-and-redundancy/redundancy/what-is-redundancy/) .

You are entitled to get a minimum redundancy payment after you have 2 years’
(104 weeks) service in your job. This is known as a _statutory redundancy_ .
The statutory redundancy payment is based on a calculation using your pay and
your length of service.

##  How much redundancy pay will I get?

The statutory redundancy payment is a lump-sum based on your pay and length of
service.

If you are eligible for redundancy pay, you are entitled to:

  * Two weeks' pay for every year of service 
  * One additional week's pay 

The maximum weekly amount used to calculate redundancy pay is €600 a week (or
€31,200 a year), even if your pay is more per week.

You can use this [ redundancy calculator
](http://www.gov.ie/redundancycalculator/) to estimate how much statutory
redundancy pay you might be entitled to.

You can see [ examples of redundancy calculations on gov.ie
](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/4be20-redundancy-calculation-
examples/#example-1-redundancy-payments-scheme-calculation) .

###  Top up payments

Your employer is not legally obliged to pay anything on top of the normal
statutory entitlements, that is, notice and statutory redundancy.

Your employer may want to give you a voluntary _top-up_ payment on the basis
that this is the industry norm.

You may have a contractual right to a top-up payment if this is stated in your
contract of employment, a collective agreement or from the custom and practice
of their employer.

##  Do I pay tax on the statutory redundancy payment?

The statutory redundancy payment is tax-free. If you get a lump sum as
compensation for losing your job, part of it may be tax-free.

Read more about [ how lump-sum payments on redundancy are taxed
](/en/employment/retirement/income-tax-in-retirement/retirement-lump-sum-
taxation/) .

More information on whether elements of the payment, such as pay in lieu of
notice, is taxable is available [ on the Revenue website.
](http://www.revenue.ie/en/tax/it/leaflets/it21.html)

##  How is my gross weekly pay calculated?

When calculating your redundancy payment, pay means your gross pay before tax
and PRSI deductions.

Gross weekly pay includes:

  * Your current normal weekly pay 
  * Average regular overtime 
  * Benefits-in-kind 

If you are paid monthly, your normal monthly pay is divided by 4.33 to
calculate the weekly pay.

###  My wages change from week to week

Where you do not have regular hours or regular pay, an average of the last 52
weeks worked is used.

###  How is average regular overtime calculated?

Average weekly overtime is calculated as follows:

  * You exclude any overtime for the 13 weeks before the date of redundancy 
  * Find the total amount of overtime earned in the previous 26 weeks (excluding the 13 weeks before the date of redundancy) 
  * If there were any weeks you did not work in the 26 weeks, then the 26 weeks can be extended back for every week not worked 
  * Divide the total by 26 to get the average weekly overtime 

This average overtime is added to the normal weekly pay.

###  I was earning less than the minimum wage

If you were earning less than the [ minimum wage ](/en/employment/employment-
rights-and-conditions/pay-and-employment/minimum-wage/) you may be entitled to
payment based on the minimum wage. There are exceptions for any [ period you
were in a statutory apprenticeship or under 20 years of age
](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/3e8be-redundancy-payments-scheme-gross-
weekly-wage/#minimum-wage) .

You can read more about [ how gross weekly pay is calculated on gov.ie
](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/3e8be-redundancy-payments-scheme-gross-
weekly-wage/) .

##  How is my length of service calculated?

_Reckonable service_ is the length of time you have been employed in your job
that is taken into account when calculating a redundancy payment.

Some absences from work over the last 3 years are deducted from your
reckonable service. Absences outside of this 3-year period are not deducted.
The 3-year period ends on the date your employment ends.

###  What is counted as reckonable service?

The following periods are included as reckonable service, (called _reckonable
absences_ ):

  * The period you were actually in work 
  * Any absence from work due to holidays 
  * Any absence from work due to illness (see below for non-reckonable periods of illness) 
  * Any period where you were absent from work by agreement with your employer (typically career break) 
  * Any period of basic and additional maternity leave allowed under the legislation 
  * Any period of basic adoptive, paternity, parental, parent’s or carer's leave 
  * Any period of lock-out from your employment 
  * Any period where the continuity of your employment is preserved under the Unfair Dismissals Acts 

###  What is not counted as reckonable service?

The following periods over the last 3 years are not counted as service,
(called _non-reckonable absences_ ):

  * Any period over 52 consecutive weeks where you were off work due to an injury at work 
  * Any period over 26 consecutive weeks where you were off work due to illness 
  * Any period on strike 
  * Any period of lay off from work 

You can see examples of redundancy calculations on gov.ie. Example 4 covers [
reckonable absences included in the calculation
](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/4be20-redundancy-calculation-
examples/#example-4-inclusion-of-reckonable-service-where-there-was-an-
absence-from-work) and Example 5 covers [ non reckonable absences excluded
from the calculation ](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/4be20-redundancy-
calculation-examples/#example-5-non-reckonable-service-excluded-from-
calculation) .

##  Lay off from work due to COVID-19 and reckonable service

If you were on the [ Temporary COVID-19 Wage Subsidy Scheme (TWSS)
](/en/employment/unemployment-and-redundancy/covid19-temporary-wage-subsidy-
scheme/) or [ Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS)
](/en/employment/unemployment-and-redundancy/employment-wage-subsidy-scheme/)
, this period is counted as reckonable service for calculating statutory
redundancy.

However, any period of layoff during the pandemic is not counted as reckonable
service (read about _reckonable service_ in ‘How is my length of service
calculated?’ above).

###  Special payment if you lost out on reckonable service

If you lost out on reckonable service while temporarily laid off during
COVID-19 and you are made redundant, you may be able to get [ a special
payment up to €2,268 ](https://enterprise.gov.ie/en/News-And-
Events/Department-News/2022/April/2022_04_19.html) (tax-free). You can apply
for the payment from 19 April 2022 (see ‘How to apply for the special
redundancy payment’ below).

The amount you get depends on how long you were on layoff. For example, if you
earned €600 or more a week and were laid off for the entire emergency period,
you will get the maximum amount of €2,268.

The payment will apply to employees who:

  * Are made redundant between 13 March 2020 and 31 January 2025 
  * Have lost reckonable service due to layoffs between 13 March 2020 and 31 January 2022 (the emergency period), caused by COVID-19 restrictions 

You can be eligible for the payment, whether or not you were getting the PUP
or a jobseeker’s payment during layoff.

The [ Redundancy Payments (Amendment) Act 2022
](https://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2022/act/3/enacted/en/print) sets out
the legal basis for the special payment. The Act came into effect on 19 April
2022.

###  How to apply for the special redundancy payment

Your employer should [ apply for the payment on your behalf
](https://www.gov.ie/en/service/7af78-covid-19-related-lay-off-payment-
scheme/#apply) to the Department of Social Protection.

If your employer does not apply on your behalf, contact the redundancy
payments section in the Department of Social Protection (you can find contact
details under ‘More information’ below).

The amount of the payment will be determined by the difference between:

  * The lump sum you would have been entitled to on redundancy if you had not been laid off due to COVID-19 
  * The amount you are actually entitled to on being made redundant 

Read more about the [ COVID-19 Related Lay-Off Payment Scheme
](https://www.gov.ie/en/service/7af78-covid-19-related-lay-off-payment-
scheme/) , including how to calculate your payment, on gov.ie.

##  I was made redundant after being on reduced hours or pay

How your payment will be calculated depends on whether you are made redundant:

  * Within a year of being put on reduced hours or pay, or 
  * After working reduced hours for more than a year 

###  You are made redundant within a year of being put on reduced hours or pay

If you are made redundant within a year of being put on reduced hours or pay,
your redundancy payment is based on your earnings for a full week.

###  You are made redundant after working reduced hours for more than a year

If you are made redundant after working reduced hours for more than a year,
how your payment is calculated depends on whether you accepted being on
reduced hours or not.

**Your situation** |  **How your payment is calculated**  
---|---  
**You fully accepted the reduced hours** |  Your redundancy payment is based on **your gross pay for the reduced working hours** if : You fully accepted the reduced working hours as your normal week You never asked to return to full-time work   
**You never accepted the reduced hours** |  Your payment is based on **your normal weekly earnings** if: You never accepted the reduced working hours as your normal hours You continually asked to be put back on full-time working   
  
##  How do I get my redundancy pay?

Your employer should pay the redundancy lump sum to you when your employment
ends. For example, this could be the last day of your notice period or on your
next pay day.

If your employer is paying you the redundancy lump sum, they do not have to
submit an online application form (previously called the RP50 form).

However, your employer should get proof that they paid your lump sum to you
and give you a copy of the proof of payment.

Your employer should also give you a written statement showing how any payment
has been worked out.

##  If I do not get my redundancy pay

If your employer does not give you statutory redundancy pay when you are
entitled to it, you should write to them asking for payment. If you have an
employee representative, such as a trade union official, they may be able to
help.

If your employer has not paid your redundancy lump sum, you should apply to
your employer for it using form [ RP77 (pdf)
](http://www.workplacerelations.ie/en/Publications_Forms/Claim_by_an_Employee_Against_an_Employer_for_a_Lump_Sum_or_Part_of_a_Lump_Sum_RP77_.pdf)
.

If your employer cannot pay or they are insolvent, you can apply to get the
payment from the Government under the Social Insurance Fund. Get more advice
if your employer cannot pay and you are [ having problems getting your
redundancy pay ](/en/employment/unemployment-and-
redundancy/redundancy/problems-getting-redundancy-pay/) .

###  Your employer refuses to pay or there is a dispute about redundancy

If your employer refuses to pay your redundancy lump sum or if there is a
dispute about redundancy you can bring a claim to the [ Workplace Relations
Commission ](/en/employment/enforcement-and-redress/workplace-relations-
commission/) . Complete and submit the [ online complaint form
](https://www.workplacerelations.ie/en/Complaints_Disputes/Refer_a_Dispute_Make_a_Complaint/)
available on workplacerelations.ie. This must be done within one year of your
dismissal.

or where there is a dispute ](/en/employment/unemployment-and-
redundancy/redundancy/right-to-redundancy-pay/) .
