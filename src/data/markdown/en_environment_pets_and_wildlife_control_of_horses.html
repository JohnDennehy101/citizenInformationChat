  * More information about owning a horse 

##  Owning a horse

If you own or keep a horse, you must follow certain rules, for example, rules
about microchipping, [ licencing
](http://staging.citizensinformation.ie/en/environment/pets_and_wildlife/control_of_horses.html#l97015)
and identification for your horse.

These rules apply to all members of the horse family, including ponies,
donkeys and crosses, officially known as _equine animals._

You are responsible for any injury or damage caused by your horse to other
people or to property.

##  Horse identification

Your horse must have the following identification:

  * An equine (horse) passport 
  * A [ microchip implant, ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/environment/pets-and-wildlife/control-of-horses/#b1b30f) which links the animal to the passport 
  * A Unique Equine Life Number (UELN) 

You must also have a [ horse license
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/environment/pets-and-wildlife/control-
of-horses/#de9046) if you are keeping your horse in a control area. Control
areas are places that are set by [ your local authority
](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/942f74-local-authorities/) .

##  How do I get a horse passport in Ireland?

You can buy a horse passport from an [ approved Passport Issuing Organisation
(PIO) ](https://www.gov.ie/en/service/066fa-equine-passports-and-
microchips/#where-to-get-the-passport) . The passport lasts for the horses
lifetime.

The passport shows the:

  * Identity of the horse 
  * Microchip number (if it has one) 
  * Unique Equine Life Number (UELN) 

The passport will also say if the horse is to be farmed for horsemeat for
human consumption. This is because the horse cannot be given certain types of
medication if it will be farmed for horsemeat.

**You should not buy a horse that does not have a passport** .

###  **When do I get a horse passport?**

If your horse was born in the Republic of Ireland, you must get its passport
either:

  * Before the 31 December in the year it was born 
  * Within 6 months of the day it is born 

For example, a horse born in May, must have a passport by 31 December of that
year. A horse born in October must have a passport within 6 months, so this
means by April of the following year.

If you are taking a foal from the holding where it was born, it must be
microchipped and have a passport.

However, you will not need a passport for the foal if it is:

  * Under 12 months old 
  * Not yet weaned 
  * Accompanied by its mother (dam or foster mare) 

If you sell or give your horse to someone else, you must give the new owner
the passport and they must register the change of ownership with the
appropriate PIO.

If your horse is over 12 months old and does not have a passport, you can
still apply for one. However, this ‘late registration’ means you will only get
a duplicate or replacement passport. So, the horse can never be sold as
horsemeat in the food chain.

###  **What happens my horse’s passport after they die?**

When your horse dies, you should return its passport to the PIO so that its
details on the database can be updated.

The slaughter plant or knackery will take the passport and send it back to the
Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.

##  Can I bring my horse to another country

**If you are importing a horse into Ireland from another EU country** , it
will need a valid passport.

**If you are importing a horse into Ireland from outside the EU** , it will
need a passport that is accepted by the EU.

**If you are importing a horse from any other country** and it does not have a
passport, you must apply to the PIO for a passport within 30 days of the horse
arriving in Ireland.

You must bring the horses’ passport whenever the horse is being moved, inside
Ireland or to another state.

You can read more about what [ health import requirements and veterinary
certification ](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/76821-equine-animals/) you
may need when moving country with your horse.

##  Do horses have to be microchipped?

Your horse must be microchipped if its passport was issued after 1 July 2009.

The microchip is a tiny computer chip that a vet implants under the horses
skin of the horse so it can be identified.

Only a vet can implant the microchip. The information on the microchip links
the horse to the horse’s passport and to the details registered on the PIO’s
database.

Your vet will charge a fee for microchipping your horse.

##  Do I need a license to own a horse in Ireland?

You must have a horse license if your horse is kept in a control area. A
control area is a specific place designated by a local authority in their
Control of Horses Byelaws and may include all of or part of the area the local
authority is responsible for.

When the local authority is making bye-laws, it must give details of the
proposed control areas in local newspapers. [ Contact your local authority
](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/942f74-local-authorities/) to get more
information on control areas for horses.

Your local authority keeps a register of all horse licences they issue.

**How do I get a horse licence?**

You can apply to your local authority for a horse licence. You will need:

  * A completed application form available from [ your local authority ](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/942f74-local-authorities/)
  * The fee 

Your local authority will want to check that you meet the standards to keep a
horse. For example, that your horse will be properly cared for and stabled.

If someone under 16 owns a horse, the head of the household is considered the
owner of the horse, as horses can’t be sold to anyone under 16.

##  Can I ride a horse on a public road?

You can ride your horse on a public road, but you must bring your horse
licence if you are riding in a designated control area. You must follow the
rules of the road for horse riding.

You can find [ information about horse safety on the road
](http://www.rsa.ie/en/RSA/Pedestrians-and-Cyclists/Horse-Road-Safety/) , and
a [ booklet on Horse Road Safety on Public Roads (pdf)
](http://www.rsa.ie/Documents/Road%20Safety/Horse_Safety/RSA_Horse_road_safety_booklet.pdf)
from the Road Safety Authority.

If you take your horse into a public place, you must make sure that it is
under your control and you are not breaking any laws. This includes bye-laws
from [ your local authority ](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/942f74-local-
authorities/) .

###  **Inspection and offences**

You must allow the Gardaí to inspect your horse if they ask to do so. You can
also be asked to show your horse licence. The Gardaí have extensive powers to
search and arrest if they suspect cruelty to horses.

You can be arrested without a warrant for most of these offences. If you are
found guilty, you can be fined or put in prison (or both) and you can be
banned from keeping a horse for some time.

The local authority may take and deal with the horse as they see fit.

Read about the laws on horses in the [ Control of Horses 1996 Act
](https://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1996/act/37/enacted/en/html) .

###  **Stray or abandoned horses**

Your horse can be seized, detained or put down if it is:

  * In a control area without a licence, 
  * Abandoned or stray 
  * Causing a nuisance or posing a danger 

If your horse has been found wandering 3 times within a 12-month period, it
can be seized and you will not get it back.

Check with [ your local authority
](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/942f74-local-authorities/) for details of
its charges for horse licences and for reclaiming a seized horse.

##  Where can I report animal cruelty?

If you suspect animal cruelty, you should report it to the:

  * **Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ISPCA)**
    * By email: helpline@ispca.ie 
    * By phone: 0818 515515 (in emergencies) 
    * On the [ ISPCA website ](https://ispca.ie/report-cruelty/)
  * **Dublin Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (DSPCA)**
    * By email: cruelty@dspca.ie

    * By email: [ animalwelfare@agriculture.gov.ie ](http://animalwelfare@agriculture.gov.ie/)
