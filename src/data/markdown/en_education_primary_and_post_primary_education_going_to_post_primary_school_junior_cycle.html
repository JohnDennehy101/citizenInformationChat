##  What is the Junior Cycle?

The Junior Cycle covers the first 3 years of secondary school. Children start
post-primary school (often called secondary school) around the age of 12 or
13.

You can study a range of subjects during the Junior Cycle. Students are
assessed and an examination is held at the end of the Junior Cycle. Students
normally sit the exam at the age of 15 or 16.

###  **Free schoolbooks for Junior Cycle students**

From September 2024, [ free schoolbooks and classroom resources, like
copybooks, journals, calculators and dictionaries
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/education/primary-and-post-primary-
education/educational-supports/financial-help-with-school/#c267ad) , will be
provided to Junior Cycle students in the Free Education Scheme. Read more
about [ free schoolbooks for Junior Cycle students
](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/5652a-schoolbooks-scheme-for-junior-cycle-
in-post-primary-schools/) on Gov.ie.

##  Junior Cycle subjects

There are many [ Junior Cycle subjects
](https://www.curriculumonline.ie/Junior-cycle/) , but all subjects are not
offered in every school.

All students must study Irish (unless you have an [ exemption from studying
Irish) ](/en/education/the-irish-education-system/exemption-from-irish/) ,
English, Maths and History. Depending on your school, other subjects may also
be compulsory.

English, Irish and Maths are studied at either ordinary or higher level. All
other subjects are studied at common level. The classroom-based assessments in
second and third year are also set at common level.

##  Junior Cycle Profile of Achievement (JCPA)

In 2022, the [ Junior Cycle Profile of Achievement (JCPA) fully replaced the
Junior Certificate ](https://www.curriculumonline.ie/Junior-cycle/Junior-
Cycle-is-changing) . It adds classroom-based assessments to the Junior Cycle.

The classroom-based component of the JCPA is based on work completed by the
student during second and third year. The written examination takes place in
June of the third year of the programme

The Department of Education has published the [ assessment arrangements for
Junior Cycle 2024 (pdf)
](https://www.gov.ie/pdf/?file=https://assets.gov.ie/270733/9d77a9be-41ac-4494-887d-b1963c81cd0a.pdf#page=null)
.

###  **Junior Cycle exams 2024**

2024.**

There was no fee to sit the Junior Cycle exams in 2024. Read more about [
Junior Cycle exams and results ](/en/education/state-examinations/junior-

###  The Junior Certificate School Programme

The [ Junior Certificate School Programme (JCSP)
](https://www.curriculumonline.ie/junior-cycle/junior-cycle-subjects/the-
junior-certificate-school-programme/) is designed to help young people who are
at risk of leaving school early and who would benefit from special support
when they are working towards the Junior Cycle exams.

Students taking the Junior Cycle exams study the normal Junior Cycle syllabus.
All students participating in the Junior Certificate School Programme must be
entered for the Junior Cycle exams. All JCSP students are entitled to a
profile - this is an individualised record of their achievement.

Read more about the JCSP in [ the Junior Certificate School Programme
statement (pdf)
](https://ncca.ie/media/2496/the_revised_jcsp_programme_statement_.pdf) .

disabilities focuses on development and learning in areas like:

  * Elementary literacy and numeracy
