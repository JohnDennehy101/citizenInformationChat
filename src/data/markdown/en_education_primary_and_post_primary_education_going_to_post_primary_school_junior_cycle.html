##  What is the Junior Cycle?

The Junior Cycle covers the first 3 years of secondary school. Children start
post-primary school (often called secondary school) around the age of 12 or
13.

You can study a range of subjects during the Junior Cycle. Students are
assessed and an examination is held at the end of the Junior Cycle. Students
normally sit the exam at the age of 15 or 16.

###  **Free schoolbooks for Junior Cycle students**

From September 2024, [ free schoolbooks and classroom resources, like
copybooks, journals, calculators and dictionaries
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/education/primary-and-post-primary-
education/educational-supports/financial-help-with-school/#c267ad) , will be

other subjects are studied at common level. The classroom-based assessments in
second and third year are also set at common level.
