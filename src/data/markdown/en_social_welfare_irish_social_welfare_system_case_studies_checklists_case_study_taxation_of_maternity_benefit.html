#  Case study: Taxation of Maternity Benefit

  * Introduction 
  * Example 1: Ann is paid her full salary whileon maternity leave 
  * Example 2: Sally is not paid any top-up by her employer while she is on maternity leave. Her Maternity Benefit is paid directly to her while she is on leave. 

##  Introduction

**This case study shows how tax credits and bands are adjusted by Revenue to
account for Maternity Benefit. Note that these examples do not refer to people
who are jointly assessed with their spouse or civil partner.**

Employees are entitled to a personal tax credit (€1,875 in 2024) and an
Employee Tax Credit (€1,875 in 2024). Their standard rate cut-off point is the
amount of their personal standard rate tax band. For each pay period, they pay
tax at the standard rate of tax (20%) up to their standard rate cut-off point.
Any income over the standard rate cut-off point is taxed at the higher rate of
40%. When the total amount of tax has been calculated, their tax credits are
subtracted from this figure to give the total amount of tax owed.

When you go on maternity leave you may qualify for 26 weeks of Maternity
Benefit. The standard rate of Maternity Benefit is €274 each week so if you
qualify for the standard payment, you will be paid €7,124 of Maternity Benefit
in total. Revenue will reduce your tax credits and weekly standard rate cut-
off point to account for the tax payable on your Maternity Benefit.

The tax due on the weekly Maternity Benefit (€274 x 20% = €54.80) will be
deducted from your weekly tax credits and the total amount of Maternity
Benefit will be deducted from your weekly cut-off point. If you do not have
your Maternity Benefit topped up by your employer, a refund of tax may arise
which can be calculated when you return to work (see Example 2 below).

**Revised tax credit and weekly cut off point calculations** Single Person’s Tax Credit  |  €1,875 annually   
---|---  
Employee (PAYE) Tax Credit  |  €1,875 annually   
Weekly Tax Credit  |  €72.12   
Maternity Benefit deduction (20% of payment)  |  less €54.80   
**Revised tax credit** |  **€17.32**  
Standard weekly cut off point (income taxed at 20%)  |  €807.69 (€42,000 annually)   
**Revised weekly cut off point (standard cut off point minus Maternity Benefit at €274)** |  **€533.69**  
  
##  Example 1: Ann is paid her full salary whileon maternity leave

Ann is on maternity leave. She receives a gross salary of €550 per week and
Maternity Benefit of €274 per week is paid directly by the Department of
Social Protection (DSP) to Ann’s employer.

Revenue will receive the Maternity Benefit details directly from the DSP,
reduce Ann’s annual tax credits and rate band by the Maternity Benefit amount
(see above for how this is done), and send a revised tax credit certificate to
her employer. Ann’s revised weekly rate band will be €533.69 and her weekly
tax credits will be €17.32.

Ann’s weekly salary while she is on maternity leave is made up of:

**Maternity Benefit:** €274

**Company Salary:** €550

**Total:** €824

The company salary portion (€550) has tax, USC and PRSI deducted by the
employer. The tax payable on the Maternity Benefit portion (€274) is collected
by the reduction in Ann’s tax credits and rate band. Maternity Benefit is not
chargeable to USC or PRSI.

**Calculation of the tax payable by Ann on the company salary portion (€550 per week)** Tax payable on €533.69 @ 20%  |  €106.74   
---|---  
Tax payable on €16.31 @ 40%  |  €6.52   
Tax payable  |  €112.86   
**Net Tax Payable** Total tax is €112.86 – less tax credit of €17.32  |  **Net tax payable is €95.54**  
[ Universal Social Charge (USC) ](../../../money_and_tax/tax/income_tax/universal_social_charge.en.html) on €550  |  €8.63   
[ PRSI ](../social_insurance_prsi/social_insurance_in_ireland.en.html) on €550 (€550 @ 4%)  |  €22   
**Total deductions** |  **€126.17**  
  
##  Example 2: Sally is not paid any top-up by her employer while she is on
maternity leave. Her Maternity Benefit is paid directly to her while she is on
leave.

Sally is not paid by her employer while on maternity leave so the following
applies. Sally earned €710 per week (€36,920 a year). She paid tax, PRSI and
Universal Social Charge weekly. Her tax and Universal Social Charge were
deducted on the assumption that she would continue to earn the same amount for
the rest of the year.

When she goes on maternity leave and starts getting Maternity Benefit, she is
no longer liable to pay the Universal Social Charge or PRSI (since these are
not charged on Maternity Benefit). She may get a refund of Universal Social
Charge. When she returns to work, she will probably also get a refund of tax
because, while she is on maternity leave, her tax credits are more than the
tax due on her Maternity Benefit and she may also have paid extra tax on her
salary before going on maternity leave.
