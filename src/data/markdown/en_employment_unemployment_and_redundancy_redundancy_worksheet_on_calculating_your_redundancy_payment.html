Worksheet on calculating your redundancy payment

#  Worksheet on calculating your redundancy payment

  * Introduction 

##  Introduction

You can use a [ redundancy calculator on MyWelfare.ie
](https://www.mywelfare.ie/redundancycalculator) to estimate your statutory
redundancy entitlements.

Date your employment terminates  
(for example, 30 June 2021) ------------  
  
Date you started work  
(for example, 1 April 2011) --------------  
  
Number of full years' service  
(for example, 10 years) --------------  
  
Number of days in part of a year's service  
(total of days in every incomplete year worked  
for example, 1 April 2021 to 30 June 2021 = 3 months = 91 days)
\---------------  
  
Deduct any non-reckonable service  
(see [ Redundancy payments ](/en/employment/unemployment-and-
redundancy/redundancy/redundancy-payments/) for details  
for example, 30 weeks' sick leave in 2012, 4 weeks is  
non-reckonable. 4 weeks = 28 days) ----------------  
  
Total of the days in a part year as percentage of a year  
(for example, 63 ÷ 365 x 100 = 17.26%) ----------------  
  
Total amount of service  
(for example, 10.17 years) ----------------  
  
Amount of your normal weekly pay  
(gross pay, that is, before tax and PRSI deducted  
for example, €700, ceiling on weekly pay is €600) ----------------  
  
Statutory redundancy lump sum payment due  
(2 weeks' pay for each year of service + one extra week  
for example, 2 weeks x 10.17 = 20.34 + 1 week = 21.34 weeks.  
Example lump sum due is €12.804 (€600 x 21.34) ----------------

](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/4be20-redundancy-calculation-
examples/#example-1-redundancy-payments-scheme-calculation) .
