##  What is FLAC?

Free Legal Advice Centre (FLAC) is an organisation that offers free basic
legal advice.

FLAC:

  * Provides free basic advice and information to help people to understand and access their rights 
  * Promote equal access to justice through advocacy [ campaigns ](https://www.flac.ie/campaigns/)
  * Conducts public interest research in areas of law to promote equality 

FLAC does not:

  * Offer legal representation or help you find legal representation 
  * Provide [ legal aid ](https://www.legalaidboard.ie/en/our-services/legal-aid-services/)

The Law Society has information on how to [ find a solicitor
](https://www.lawsociety.ie/find-a-solicitor) .

The [ Legal Aid Board ](http://legal%20aid%20board/) is the independent
statutory body responsible for the provision of [ civil legal aid
](http://civil%20legal%20aid/) and advice, family mediation and vulnerable
witness-related services.

##  How can I get free legal information from FLAC?

You can get free basic legal information from the FLAC phone line on (01) 906
1010.

In some cases, FLAC may refer you to another voluntary body or state service.

FLAC cannot give you legal information or advice via email or post.

You can also check [ guides with legal information
](https://www.flac.ie/help/online/) on the FLAC website.

##  FLAC phone advice appointments

FLAC also provide a small number of free legal advice phone appointments with
volunteer lawyers.

These appointments are limited and not available by request. You can be
referred for a FLAC phone advice appointment by a [ Citizens Information
Centre (CIC) ](https://centres.citizensinformation.ie/) or another FLAC
partner.

An information officer in the CIC or another FLAC partner organisation will
discuss your query with you before referral.

The appointment is a free, confidential 15-20 minute phone call that can
provide:

  * First stop assistance 
  * Basic legal information 
  * Advice, such as the next steps you need to take 
  * A referral to another appropriate service 

You cannot get a FLAC phone advice appointment if you:

  * Need ongoing legal advice and/or representation 
  * Have complex legal queries 
  * Already have a lawyer acting on your behalf 
  * Are looking for a second opinion on legal advice you already received 
  * Can afford to pay for legal advice or get legal advice from your union 
  * Are an employer 

Face-to-face FLAC advice clinics are no longer available in Citizens
Information Centres.

You can learn more about these appointments on the [ FLAC website
](https://www.flac.ie/help/centres/) .

##  Can I volunteer to work at FLAC?

FLAC posts [ volunteer opportunities ](https://www.flac.ie/getinvolved/) on
their website as they arise. Sometimes it's necessary to be [ fully qualified
to practice law in Ireland
](https://www.flac.ie/getinvolved/volunteering/volunteering-at-a-flac.html) to
volunteer with FLAC.
