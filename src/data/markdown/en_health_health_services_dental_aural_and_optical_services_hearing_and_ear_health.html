##  Introduction

The HSE audiology service provides help with hearing loss for children and
adults.

The audiology service is free for all children under 18 and eligible adults in
Ireland. It is also free for students until they leave third level education.

To use the service, you'll need a medical professional (such as your GP) to
refer you. In some cases, your GP may refer you to an ear, nose and throat
(ENT) consultant at a hospital.

Read about [ what the HSE audiology service does
](https://www2.hse.ie/services/audiology/using-the-hse-audiology-service.html)
. Check [ where your local audiology centre is
](https://www2.hse.ie/services/audiology/audiology-centres-across-
ireland.html) .

##  How to get your hearing checked inIreland

If you've noticed a problem with your own hearing, talk to your GP. Your GP
may refer you to the HSE Community Audiology Service or an [ ear, nose and
throat (ENT) service ](https://www2.hse.ie/services/audiology/going-to-an-ear-
nose-and-throat-ent-appointment-about-your-hearing.html) at a hospital. There
is no charge to attend a public hospital outpatient clinic if you are referred
there, including for people without a medical card.

The audiologist (a hearing specialist) or ENT specialist will examine your
ear. They may [ test your hearing in different ways
](https://www2.hse.ie/services/audiology/tests-for-hearing-loss-in-
adults.html) .

If the audiologist or ENT specialist decides you need a hearing test you can
get a free hearing test if you have a medical card or are are aged under 18.

##  Hearing aids

If you need a hearing aid you can get it free from the HSE audiology service
if you:

  * Have a medical card 
  * Are aged under 18 
  * Have a Health Amendment Act Card 

If you are not eligible for a free hearing aid, you may be able to get help
with the costs of repairing or getting a new hearing aid under the [ Treatment
Benefit Scheme. ](/en/social-welfare/disability-and-illness/treatment-benefit-
scheme/)

You may also be able to claim tax relief on hearing aids.

If you have private health insurance, check with your insurance company
whether your policy covers hearing aid costs.

You can [ read about the types of hearing aids the HSE offer and the process
of getting a hearing aid ](https://www2.hse.ie/services/audiology/hearing-
aids.html) for your needs. The ENT audiology service does not work with
hearing aids.

](https://www2.hse.ie/screening-and-vaccinations/newborn-hearing/newborn-
hearing-screening-why-we-screen-babies-for-hearing-loss.html) to check if your
baby has permanent hearing loss in one or both ears.

Your baby may be referred to the paediatric audiologist after the screening.
If so, the screener will arrange your appointment with the paediatric
audiologist. They will do diagnostic hearing tests on your baby.

###  Hearing services for older children

For older children, your GP or another healthcare professional may refer your
child to the HSE community audiology department. The audiology service will
arrange your appointment.
