#  Dental services

  * Private patients 
  * How to apply 

##  Introduction

The Health Service Executive (HSE) provides some free dental treatment through
the public health service. Services are provided by dentists employed by [
Local Health Offices ](http://www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/1/LHO/) in your
area and by private dentists who have contracts with the HSE to provide
certain services.

If you do not qualify for HSE services, then you can use a private dental
service.

##  Dental services for adults

###  Treatment Benefit Scheme

If you have paid enough social insurance contributions you can get free dental
examinations and a subsidised scale and polish once a year under the [
Treatment Benefit Scheme ](/en/social-welfare/disability-and-
illness/treatment-benefit-scheme/) .

###  Medical card holders

The Dental Treatment Services Scheme (DTSS) provides access to dental
treatment for adult [ medical card ](/en/health/medical-cards-and-gp-visit-
cards/medical-card/) holders (aged 16 or over).

Medical card holders are entitled to a free dental examination in each
calendar year, as well as any extractions that are required. One first-stage
endodontic (root canal) treatment is also available each year for teeth at the
front of the mouth.

Two fillings are free in each calendar year. For a filling on a tooth that has
already been filled in the last 5 years, the dentist must seek approval from
the local HSE Principal Dental Surgeon detailing why it is clinically
necessary to repeat the filling.

Denture repairs, the control of haemorrhage and the issuing of prescriptions
will be covered where required.

All other treatments, including providing dentures, require the prior approval
of the local HSE Principal Dental Surgeon.

##  Dental services for children

Dental services for children are provided by dentists in local HSE dental
clinics. This service is accessed through screening appointments in your
child's primary school.

###  Routine dental treatment

All children in certain classes in primary school and children with special
needs are offered an appointment for a free dental exam. A follow up
appointment will be made with your local HSE Dental Clinic if needed.

Children outside of these classes will only be seen by the HSE Dental Clinic
for emergency treatment.

###  Emergency Dental Care for Children

All children aged under 16 years of age are entitled to attend for emergency
treatment. Call [ your local HSE Dental Clinic
](https://www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/1/lho/) for dental emergency treatment.

###  Orthodontic treatment

The HSE provides free orthodontic treatment for children who have the most
severe orthodontic problems. The criteria used to decide whether a child
qualifies is based on an international grading system called the Index of
Orthodontic Treatment Need.

HSE dental surgeons can advise on eligibility and refer you to the local HSE
orthodontic unit for assessment if appropriate. The types of orthodontic
problems that qualify under the guidelines include front teeth that are buried
and fail to emerge, multiple missing teeth, very prominent front teeth or
severe problems with the bite or jaw development.

##  Private patients

If you do not qualify for HSE services, you can use a private dental service.

Dentists must display private fees in a place where patients can view them
before consultation. A single fee must apply for some procedures while the
fees for others may be shown as a range, with a minimum and maximum clearly
stated. Where a range of fees applies, it is not permitted to set a minimum
price only.

The Dental Council has produced a [ Code of Practice relating to: Display of
Private Fees in Dental Practices (pdf) ](https://www.dentalcouncil.ie/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/Display-of-Private-Fees-Code-of-Practice-
Feb-2011-20110330.pdf) .

###  Tax relief on dental expenses

If you pay for dental services from a private practitioner, you may claim tax
relief for certain specialised dental treatments. (Routine treatments such as
extractions, scaling and filling of teeth and provision and repairing of
artificial teeth and dentures are excluded from tax relief).

Further information on how to claim tax relief for specific dental costs
incurred by you whether for yourself, your spouse, your dependent child or a
dependent relative is available in our document on [ taxation and medical
expenses ](/en/money-and-tax/tax/income-tax-credits-and-reliefs/taxation-and-
medical-expenses/) .

###  Clinical Dental Technicians

Clinical Dental Technicians are dental healthcare professionals, registered
with the [ Dental Council ](http://www.dentalcouncil.ie/) . They provide
complete dentures and partial dentures directly to adult patients who have
recently been assessed by a dentist. They do not carry out work on natural
teeth or on living tissue.

Clinical Dental Technicians who have a contract with the HSE can treat medical
card holders under the Dental Treatment Services Scheme, providing approved
dentures and relines as well as denture repairs and additions.

###  How to make a complaint against a Dentist

You must first make a complaint directly to the staff in the dental surgery
involved. They should give you full details of the complaints procedure and
try to sort out your complaint. If you are not satisfied with the response you
receive, you can contact the [ Dental Complaints Resolution Service
](https://dentalcomplaints.ie/) who will work with you and the dentist to
resolve the complaint.

##  How to apply

[ Your local health centre
](http://www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/2/healthcentres/) may provide a list of
dentists who treat medical card holders. Dentists who offer services to
medical card holders are listed as taking part in the Dental Treatment
Services Scheme.

The [ Irish Dental Association ](http://www.dentist.ie/) is the main
representative body for general dental practitioners, dental specialists and
HSE dental surgeons. You can [ find a dentist
](https://portal.irishdentalassoc.ie/Find-A-Dentist) who takes medical card
patients on their members' list.

The [ Dental Council ](http://www.dentalcouncil.ie/) has a [ list of
registered Clinical Dental Technicians (pdf)
](http://www.dentalcouncil.ie/files/Register%20of%20CDTs%20-%20March%202020%20-%2020200327.pdf)
