##  Introduction

Nineteen [ European Union ](/en/government-in-ireland/european-
government/european-union/european-union/) member states are part of the euro
area, or Eurozone. These countries use the euro as their national currency.
They are:

**Countries that use the euro** Austria  |  Germany  |  Luxemburg   
---|---|---  
Belgium  |  Greece  |  Malta   
Croatia  |  Ireland  |  Netherlands   
Cyprus  |  Italy  |  Portugal   
Estonia  |  Latvia  |  Slovakia   
Finland  |  Lithuania  |  Slovenia   
France  |  |  Spain   
  
Andorra, Monaco, San Marino and Vatican City also use the euro as their
national currency, although these small countries are not part of the EU or
euro area.

The euro currency was physically launched in 2002, but the idea of the
monetary union of the member states of the EU was agreed earlier in the [
Treaty of Maastricht ](https://www.europarl.europa.eu/about-parliament/en/in-
the-past/the-parliament-and-the-treaties/maastricht-treaty) in 1992.

This document explains how the euro area works, the role of the [ European
Central Bank ](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/home/html/index.en.html) and the
other mechanisms that are in place to protect the currency.

##  Economic and Monetary Union

The Maastricht Treaty set the EU on the path to a single currency when it
enshrined the [ Economic and Monetary Union (EMU)
](https://ec.europa.eu/info/business-economy-euro/economic-and-fiscal-policy-
coordination/economic-and-monetary-union/what-economic-and-monetary-union-
emu_en) .

EMU applies to all member states of the EU, including the countries that are
not part of the euro area. This means that monetary policy in the EU is co-
ordinated. EU countries decide their own economic policies and set their own
budgets, but they must follow the rules set out in the Stability and Growth
Pact.

In the euro area, monetary policy is managed by the European Central Bank
(ECB). The ECB is independent of the EU. For the countries outside the euro
area, monetary policy is co-ordinated by the ECB through the central banks of
each member state.

##  The European Central Bank (ECB)

The [ European Central Bank
](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/home/html/index.en.html) (ECB) is the central bank
for the euro area and acts independently from the EU. The ECB has a number of
important functions:

  * It sets interest rates for the euro area 
  * It manages the euro area’s foreign currency reserves 
  * It watches over central banks and payment systems in the euro area to make sure that they are working properly and fairly 
  * It authorises the production of euro banknotes in euro area countries 
  * It acts to keep prices from going up to sharply 

The ECB is the ultimate banking supervisor for all banks in the euro area and
is directly responsible for supervising the largest banking groups (117 in
total). Other banks are supervised by their national central banks in close
cooperation with the ECB.

The ECB and the central banks of the countries in the EU make up the European
System of Central Banks (ESCB).

The ECB and the central banks of the countries in the euro area make up the
Eurosystem.

[ Read more about the ESCB and the Eurosystem on the ECB's website.
](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/ecb/orga/escb/html/index.en.html)

##  Euro summits

Euro summits are held at least twice a year and include:

  * The heads of state or government of all the euro area countries 
  * The president of the Euro Summit 
  * President of the European Commission 

The purpose of the summits is to decide on the strategic economic direction of
the euro area, and to help euro area countries to co-ordinate their economic
policies.

The President of the Euro Summits is elected at the same time as the President
of the [ European Council ](/en/government-in-ireland/european-government/eu-
institutions/european-council/) . Since the Fiscal Stability Treaty was signed
in 2012, the Euro Summits’ role has been set out in law.

##  The Eurogroup

The [ Eurogroup ](https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/council-eu/eurogroup/)
brings together the finance ministers of the countries in the euro area. It is
responsible for:

  * Preparing the Euro Summit meetings and their follow up 
  * Help coordinate the economic policies of the euro area member states 

The Eurogroup usually meets every month. Meetings are also attended by the
commissioner for economic and financial affairs, taxation and customs, and the
president of the ECB.

##  The European Stability Mechanism

The [ European Stability Mechanism (ESM) ](https://www.esm.europa.eu/)
provides assistance to countries in the euro area that are having severe
financial problems. It gives assistance if the financial problems of the
country concerned threaten to damage the financial stability of the euro area
as a whole.

Countries can only receive help from the ESM if they have ratified the [
Fiscal Stability Treaty
](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/other/mb201203_focus12.en.pdf) .

Ireland received financial assistance from the EU and others in 2010. This was
referred to as ‘the bailout’, EU financial assistance was provided by the
European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) and the European Financial
Stability Mechanism (EFSM). The ETSF has been replaced by the ESM.
