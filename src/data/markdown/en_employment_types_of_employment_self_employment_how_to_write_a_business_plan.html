  * Guides and templates 
  * More information on starting a business 

##  What is a business plan?

A business plan is a document that outlines your business goals and how you
expect to achieve them. If you are starting a business, you will need a
business plan to approach a financial institution for a loan, apply for a
small business grant, or pitch to investors.

##  What to include in your business plan

There is no standard format when writing a business plan. You can include any
information that you consider important for your business. It is recommended
that at a minimum, your business plan should include:

###  **An executive summary**

This is where you describe your business and why you think it will succeed. It
must show that a market exists for your product or service. You should explain
how you plan to market the business to customers.

###  **Your business and products**

This section should include your main products and services, the legal status
of the business and your long-term business goals.

###  **Market research**

Include any market analysis you have completed and your sales strategy. You
should also include the price of your product or services.

###  **Management and organisation structure**

This section should include an outline of the management structure of the
business. Include any requirements in terms of staff, equipment and machinery.

###  **Financial plan**

This section should include projections for expected income and costs, and
your funding requirements.

##  Guides and templates

There is no fixed template for setting out your business plan. Each bank or
support institution may have their own template.

You can use the [ outline of a business plan for start-ups and micro
businesses ](https://www.localenterprise.ie/DublinCity/Start-or-Grow-your-
Business/Starting-a-Business/Business-Plan/Writing-a-Business-Plan/) on the
Local Enterprise Office website.

You can also go to Enterprise Ireland for information on [ business strategy
frameworks ](https://www.enterprise-ireland.com/en/insights-webinars/business-
strategy-frameworks) .

Teagasc has a [ workbook to help prospective farmers organise their ideas
](https://www.teagasc.ie/rural-economy/farm-management/financial-
analysis/farm-business-planning/) , before they develop a full business plan.
