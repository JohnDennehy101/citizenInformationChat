##  What is a quad bike?

A quad bike or all-terrain vehicle (ATV) is a four-wheel powered vehicle
designed to be driven off-road, for example, on a farm.

##  Are quad bikes legal on public roads in Ireland?

Yes. A quad bike is treated the same as any other vehicle on the road. You
must have tax, insurance, a driving licence, and your [ quad should be
registered with Revenue ](https://www.revenue.ie/en/vrt/vehicle-registration-
tax/index.aspx) . You must display number plates. Contact Revenue for
information on the documents you need.

You must be 16 to drive a light quad of 350kg or less with a maximum design
speed of not more than 45 km/h. To drive a heavier quad, you must be at least
17 years old.

###  **Quads only used on farms (Not on public roads)**

If you only use your quad on the farm, it does not need to be taxed and
insured. Minors using quad bikes on private property fall under the [ Health
and Safety Authority ](http://www.hsa.ie/) .

###  **New quad bike regulations**

Several fatalities have occurred in recent years and your safety is important.
[ New rules ](https://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2021/si/619/made/en/print)
have been in place since 20 November 2023 to help protect drivers such as:

  * Compulsory training 
  * Wearing a helmet 

##  Quad bike training

Since November 2023, it is compulsory for anyone driving a quad to complete a
training course with a registered training provider. This applies even if you
only drive your quad on a farm.

There are one-day and 2-day training courses available. The costs can vary
slightly and depend on your driving experience. You may get a discount for
group bookings. Check with the course provider directly.

You must ensure the training provider is registered (for example, LANTRA, City
& Guilds NPTC, QQI or an equivalent). The training course must meet the [
minimum standard in the QQI ATV and quad bike training
](https://qsdocs.qqi.ie/sites/docs/AwardsLibraryPdf/5N1752_AwardSpecifications_English.pdf)
.

The training combines theory and practice. After successfully completing the
course, you will receive a certificate, which is generally valid for 5 years.

See the table before for a summary of quad training costs.

**Course type** |  **Duration** |  **Cost range**  
---|---|---  
Experienced drivers  |  1 day  |  €250 - €300   
Less experienced drivers  |  2 days  |  €450 - €535   
  
Tasks covered in the QQI standard training should include:

  * Safety assessments (hazards, risks and controls) 
  * Routine checks before starting 
  * Identifying functions and understanding controls 
  * Safe starting procedures 
  * Terrain assessment 
  * Safe speed management 
  * Manoeuvring a quad and trailer in a confined area in varied conditions 
  * Hitching trailers correctly 
  * Smooth take-off and speed control 

##  Quad bike helmets

Under the new rules, you must wear a helmet when using a quad. The helmet is
typically a motorcycle helmet or a specialist ATV (all-terrain vehicle)
helmet. The type of helmet chosen must be based on an assessment of the
circumstance in which the quad bike will be used, such as the types of surface
travelled over and anticipated speeds. The harder the surface and higher the
speed, the greater the degree of protection needed.

The helmet should:

  * Have a chinstrap 
  * Be capable of being used with suitable eye protection 
  * Fit comfortably and securely 

Standard industrial hard hats, forestry helmets or cycling helmets are not
acceptable helmets.

##  Can I tow a trailer with a quad on a public road?

Yes. The quad must be taxed, insured and roadworthy. You must have an
appropriate driving licence for that vehicle combination and the loaded weight
of the trailer must not exceed the quad’s towing capacity.

##  Can I carry a passenger on a quad?

You cannot carry a passenger on a quad. The only exception is if the quad was
originally manufactured to carry a passenger.

Carrying children on the back of a quad is illegal.
