##  Marriage registration

The process of registering a marriage in Ireland is the same whether you are
marrying in a registry office, or having a religious or secular ceremony. Read
about the [ different types of marriage ceremonies in Ireland ](/en/birth-
family-relationships/getting-married/different-legal-ways-of-getting-married/)
.

##  Before you get married

Before you get married, you and the person you want to marry must give
_notification of your intention to marry_ to the Registrar at your local [
Civil Registration Service ](https://www2.hse.ie/services/births-deaths-and-
marriages/contact-a-civil-registration-service.html) . You must do this in
person, at least 3 months before the date of your marriage. Read more about [
notification requirements for marriage ](/en/birth-family-
relationships/getting-married/notification-requirements-for-marriage/) .

If you are already in a civil partnership and wish to marry, you should
contact the Registrar who will guide you through the process. The notification
can be given to any Registrar. [ Find your local Civil Registration Service
](https://www2.hse.ie/services/births-deaths-and-marriages/contact-a-civil-
registration-service.html) .

##  What is a Marriage Notification Form?

When you give _notification of your intention to marry_ , and if there is no
impediment (barrier) to your marriage, the Registrar will issue you with a
Marriage Registration Form (MRF) which gives you permission to marry. You need
an MRF in order to get married in Ireland. The MRF is also needed to register
your marriage, so it is an important document.

You should give the MRF to the person who will be solemnising your marriage
before the marriage ceremony. Immediately after the marriage ceremony the MRF
should be signed by you and your spouse, the two witnesses and the person
solemnising the marriage.

##  Registering your marriage

If you get married by civil ceremony, the Registrar who solemnised the
marriage will register the marriage with the information on the MRF as soon as
possible after the ceremony.

If you get married by religious or secular ceremony, you should give the MRF
to a Registrar at a [ Civil Registration Service
](https://www2.hse.ie/services/births-deaths-and-marriages/contact-a-civil-
registration-service.html) within 1 month for the marriage to be registered.
It does not have to be returned to the same Registrar who gave it to you.

You cannot get your marriage certificate until your marriage is registered.

##  Registration of marriages outside Ireland

Marriages of Irish citizens abroad are normally registered in the country
where they happen. The [ General Register Office
](http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/General-Register-Office.aspx) (central civil
repository for records relating to births, deaths and marriages in Ireland)
has no role in the registration of marriages of Irish citizen(s) that take
place abroad, or in advising on such marriages. Marriages that take place
outside the State are not registered in Ireland.

Your foreign marriage certificate will usually be accepted for official
purposes in Ireland where you need to show evidence that you are married. If
the certificate is in a foreign language, you must provide an official
translation or a translation from a recognised translation agency.

##  Rates

There is no fee charged for the registration of a marriage, or for the
correction of errors on a marriage certificate. Fees are charged for copies of
certificates.

The fees charged for a certificate are as follows:

  * €20 for a full standard certificate 
  * €5 for an uncertified copy of an entry in the Register 
  * €10 to have a certificate authenticated (only available from the General Register Office) 
  * €0 for a Multilingual Standard Form (MSF) 

A Multilingual Standard Form (MSF) can be requested for birth, death, marriage
and civil partnership certificates. A MSF is a translation of the certificate
that you can present to authorities in other EU member states. You must choose
which EU language you want for the MSF, and it must be requested at the same
time as when you apply for the certificate.

##  Getting a copy of your marriage certificate

To get a copy of a marriage certificate, you will need to give the date (or
approximate date if not known) and place of the marriage, and the full names
of the couple before they married.

If you got married in Ireland (whether by civil, secular or religious
ceremony) you can order a copy of your marriage certificate [ online
](https://certificatespublic-webapp-
prod.azurewebsites.net/Certs/ApplicantDetails) (full standard certificates
only), [ by post using an application form (pdf)
](https://assets.gov.ie/41368/54a468251ce84642b6d14043ca5a481c.pdf) , by phone
or in person at any [ Civil Registration Service
](https://www2.hse.ie/services/births-deaths-and-marriages/contact-a-civil-
registration-service.html) .

You must pay €2 for postage of online orders in Ireland, and €3 per order
outside of Ireland. Delivery time depends on how long it takes to locate the
certificate and where it is being posted to. You will get a full refund if the
record cannot be found.

##  Family research

The General Register Office has a family research facility known as the [ GRO
Research Room ](https://www.gov.ie/en/organisation-information/55ccbe-general-
register-office-gro-research-facility/) at Werburgh Street, Dublin 2, where
