##  Travelling to Ireland to study

Citizens of certain countries who wish to pursue a course of study in Ireland
must apply for a visa to enter Ireland before they travel here. Read about [
Visa requirements for entering Ireland ](/en/moving-country/visas-for-
ireland/visa-requirements-for-entering-ireland/) .

If you are a non-EEA national coming to study in Ireland you must be enrolled
in a full-time course on the [ Interim List of Eligible Programmes (ILEP)
](https://www.irishimmigration.ie/coming-to-study-in-ireland/what-are-my-
study-options/a-third-level-course-or-a-language-course/#eligiblecourses) .
You can find out more in our page on [ the immigration rules for non-EEA
students ](/en/moving-country/moving-to-ireland/studying-in-
ireland/immigration-nonEEA-students/) .

Visa applicants must apply online for their visa - see 'How to apply'. If you
wish to study in Ireland for less than 3 months you should apply for a 'C
study visa'. If your course lasts longer than 3 months, you should apply for a
'D study visa'.

You will need to provide the following with your visa application. (Please
remember, **original documents** are required and **must be in English** or
accompanied by a notarised translation):

  * Letter of acceptance from a recognised school or college or university in Ireland confirming that you have been accepted on a course of study. This course of study must be full-time (lasting an academic year) and have a minimum of 15 hours per week study time. 
  * Evidence of your academic ability to pursue the chosen course through the English language (unless it is an English language course). 
  * Evidence that the fees for the course have been paid in full. 
  * Evidence that you have enough funds (€10,000) to maintain yourself for the initial part of your stay. 
  * Evidence that you or a sponsor have access to **at least €10,000 for each subsequent year** of your studies, in addition to the course fees for each of those years. 
  * Evidence that you have private medical insurance 
  * An explanation of any gaps in your educational history 
  * Confirmation that you intend to return to your country of permanent residence when you leave Ireland. 

Remember, the granting of a student visa to study in Ireland **does not
confer** the automatic right of anyone to join or visit you in Ireland
(whether they are a relative or not).

You will find more detailed [ information on the exact requirements for a
student visa ](https://www.irishimmigration.ie/coming-to-study-in-
ireland/what-are-my-study-visa-options/) on the website of the Department of
Justice.

###  If I don't need an entry visa to enter Ireland, do I need a student visa
to study?

No. If you do not need an entry visa to enter Ireland, you do not need a
student visa to study in Ireland. However, all non-EEA nationals, including
those with visas, must get permission to enter the State by reporting to an
Immigration Officer at the port of entry. (The members of the EEA are the 27
countries of the European Union (EU), together with Iceland, Norway and
Liechtenstein). You must still register at your local immigration office after
you arrive. You need to get an Irish Residence Permit (IRP) if you are
studying for more than 3 months.

You should have all documentation relating to your studies on your person when
coming through immigration. In other words, you should have your letter of
offer of a place at the school, or educational institution ready for
inspection at immigration. You can read more in our page on [ permission to
land in Ireland ](/en/moving-country/visas-for-ireland/permission-to-land-in-
ireland/) .

###  Permission to stay

Students from a non-EEA country who intend studying in Ireland for a period of
more than 3 months must register, after they arrive, with the [ local
immigration officer ](https://www.irishimmigration.ie/registering-your-
immigration-permission/how-to-register-your-immigration-permission-for-the-
first-time/) for the district in which they are living ( [ Burgh Quay
Registration Office ](https://www.irishimmigration.ie/burgh-quay-
appointments/) if living in Dublin, Cork, Kildare, Limerick, Meath or
Wicklow).

Your passport will be endorsed with the conditions and period of time for
which they have permission to remain.

Students who plan to study for up to 6 months must have access to €700 per
month or €4,200 (whichever is the lesser) when they first register.
Information on what documentation students require when applying for
permission is available on the [ website of the Department of Justice.
](https://www.irishimmigration.ie/coming-to-study-in-ireland/what-are-my-
study-visa-options/how-to-apply-for-long-term-study-visa/#guide)

Non-EEA students coming to Ireland for the first time may not get permission
to stay in Ireland if they have their children with them or intend their
children to join them later on.

You can find out how to register in our page on [ Registration of non-EEA
nationals in Ireland ](/en/moving-country/moving-to-ireland/rights-of-
residence-in-ireland/registration-of-non-eea-nationals-in-ireland/) .

###  Student visa/permission renewals

You can renew your permission with the [ local immigration officer
](https://www.irishimmigration.ie/registering-your-immigration-permission/how-
to-renew-your-current-permission/) for the district in which you live. If you
live in Dublin, Cork, Kildare, Limerick, Meath or Wicklow you can [ renew your
student permission online ](https://www.irishimmigration.ie/registering-your-
immigration-permission/how-to-renew-your-current-permission/registration-
renewal-dublin-kildare-meath-or-wicklow/) . Your Irish Residence Permit will
be sent to you by post.

If your registration is refused and you believe that you have exceptional
circumstances, you can [ apply for an extension of your student permission by
post ](https://www.irishimmigration.ie/introduction-of-application-form-for-
extension-of-student-permission/) only.

**Summer 2024: If you are waiting for a course to start**

English Language students who have successfully completed a second English
language course on or after 1 July 2024, or a third English language course,
and have enrolled for a Higher Education Programme (HEP) which starts by the

stamp-2-bridging-permission-2024-update/) to stay in Ireland until 30

ends on 30 September 2024.

###  Access to employment while in Ireland on a student visa

my-study-options/a-third-level-course-or-a-language-course/#eligiblecourses)
you will have _stamp number 2_ endorsed on your passport when you register
with your local immigration officer. You will be allowed to take up [ casual

You can read information on [ employment rights of part-time workers in
Ireland ](/en/employment/types-of-employment/rights-of-part-time-workers/) .

###  What do I do if I want to leave for a short while?

A visa required national with a valid Irish Residence Permit (IRP) or GNIB
card will not need a [ re-entry visa ](/en/moving-country/visas-for-
ireland/visa-requirements-for-entering-ireland/) when traveling to and from
Ireland. Your IRP card and passport will be accepted.

If you want to travel to Northern Ireland, you may need a visa. You can get
more information from [ UK Visas and Immigration ](https://www.gov.uk/contact-
ukvi-outside-uk) .
