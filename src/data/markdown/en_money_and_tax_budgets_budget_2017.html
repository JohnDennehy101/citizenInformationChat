##  Taxation

###  Income tax

The Home Carer's Tax Credit that is given to married couples or civil partners
where one spouse or civil partner works in the home caring for a dependent
person is increasing from €1,000 to €1,100.

The Earned Income Credit (pdf) for taxpayers earning self-employed trading or
professional income in certain cases and for business owner/managers who are
ineligible for a PAYE credit on their salary income is increasing from €550 to
€950. **** ****

The residential rental property relief available for qualifying interest
payments on monies borrowed to purchase, improve or repair residential rental
property is being increased from 75% to 80%. This measure will apply to both
new and existing mortgages.

The ceiling for exemption from income tax under the Rent a Room scheme for
income received from the letting of a room or rooms in a person’s principal
private residence is being increased from €12,000 to €14,000 for 2017 and
subsequent years. ****

An income tax rebate incentive for first-time buyers of new homes is being
introduced to help fund the deposit required under the Central Bank macro-
prudential rules. It will consist of a rebate of income tax paid over the
previous four years up to 5% of the purchase price of up to €400,000. Where
new homes are valued between €400,000 and €600,000 the maximum relief of
€20,000 will continue to be available. The house must be a new build and
applicants must take out a mortgage of at least 80% of the purchase price. The
scheme will run until the end of 2019.

The Home Renovation Incentive (HRI), which provides an income tax credit to
homeowners who carry out renovation and improvement works on their principal
private residences, is being extended until 31 December 2018.

The Living City Initiative, which aims to assist the regeneration of retail
and commercial districts and encourage families to live in historic buildings
in city centres is being amended to encourage an increase in the take-up of
the scheme. This involves extending the availability of the scheme to
landlords, while for residential applicants it removes the restriction on the
maximum floor size of the property, removes the requirement that the property
must have been previously used as a dwelling, and reduces the minimum amount
of expenditure needed to qualify.

A new **Fishers Tax Credit** is being introduced to assist the viability of
the fishing sector. Fishers who have fished for wild fish or wild shellfish
for at least 80 days in a tax year can claim an income tax credit of €1,270
per annum.

Foreign Earnings Deduction (FED) is being extended until the end of 2020. In
addition:

  * Qualifying countries are being extended to include Colombia and Pakistan 
  * The minimum number of days for travel is being reduced to 30 per annum 

The Special Assignee Relief Programme (SARP) is being extended for a further 3
years until the end of 2020.

The Start Your Own Business tax relief is being extended for 2 years until the
end of 2018.

###  Universal Social Charge (USC)

Incomes of €13,000 or less will continue to be exempt from USC in 2017. Once
your income is over this limit, you will pay the relevant rate of USC on all
of your income as follows:

  * €0 to €12,012 @ 0.5% 
  * €12,012.01 to €18,772 @ 2.5% 
  * €18,772.01 to €70,044 @ 5% 
  * €70,044.01 to €100,000 @ 8% 
  * PAYE income in excess of €100,000 @ 8% 
  * Self-employed income in excess of €100,000 @ 11% 

Medical card holders and individuals aged 70 years and over whose aggregate
income does not exceed €60,000 will pay a maximum USC rate of 2.5%.

###  Deposit Interest Retention Tax (DIRT)

The rate of Deposit Interest Retention Tax will decrease by 2% each year for
the next 4 years until it reaches 33%.

###  Capital Acquisitions Tax (CAT)

The Capital Acquisitions Tax tax-free thresholds are being increased as
follows:

  * The Group A threshold applying to gifts and inheritances from parents to children is being raised from €280,000 to €310,000 
  * The Group B threshold applying to gifts and inheritances made to parents, siblings, nieces, nephews or grandchildren is being raised from €30,150 to €32,500 
  * The Group C threshold applying to gifts and inheritances made to all others (except spouses and civil partners who are exempt) is being raised from €15,075 to €16,250 

These increases apply in respect of gifts or inheritances received on or after
12 October 2016.

###  Excise duties

The excise duty on a **packet of 20 cigarettes** is being increased by 50
cents (including VAT) with a pro-rata increase on the other tobacco products,
with effect from midnight on 11 October 2016.

The Vehicle Registration Tax (VRT) reliefs available for the purchase of
hybrid electric vehicles and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, are being
extended to 31 December 2018. Reliefs available for electric vehicles and
electric motorcycles are being extended to 31 December 2021\. ****

The special relief reducing the standard rate of Alcohol Products Tax by 50%
on **beers produced in microbreweries** which produce not more than 30,000
hectolitres per annum is being extended to apply to microbreweries which
produce not more than 40,000 hectolitres per annum. Relief is still available
on the first 30,000 hectolitres of beer produced.

The fuel inputs used to create **high efficiency electricity in combined heat
and power plants** are being fully exempted from carbon tax.

###  Capital Gains Tax (CGT)

A reduced Capital Gains Tax rate of 10% will apply to the **disposal in whole
or in part of a business** up to an overall limit of €1 million in qualifying
chargeable gains.

Payments under the new **raised bog restoration incentive scheme** to relevant
owners and rights holders will be exempt from Capital Gains Tax.

###  Agri Measures

The Farmer’s Flat-Rate Addition will increase from 5.2% to 5.4% with effect
from 1 January 2017. Farmers not registered for VAT add a Flat-Rate percentage
to their sales of produce and agricultural services to VAT registered
customers who are entitled to reclaim such VAT in their VAT returns. The flat-
rate scheme compensates the farmers for VAT incurred on their farming inputs.

The scheme of accelerated capital allowances for energy efficient equipment is
being made available to sole traders and non-corporates.

The **Income Averaging regime** allows a farmer’s taxable profit to be
averaged out over a 5-year period. This is being amended to allow an “opt out”
in a single year of unexpectedly poor income, and, instead, pay only the tax
due on a current year basis with any deferred tax liability becoming payable
over subsequent years. This may be availed of for the 2016 tax year.

**Farm restructuring CGT relief** is available where the first transaction in
the restructuring (e.g. sale, purchase or exchange of land) is carried out by
31 December 2016 with the restructuring to be completed within 24 months. The
deadline for the completion of the first restructuring transaction is being
extended to 31 December 2019.

##  Housing, Employment and Business, Education and Childcare

###  Housing

A total of €1.2 billion is allocated to the Department of Housing, Planning,
Community and Local Government for Housing in 2017. This will allow for
continued implementation of the Housing Action Plan. Under the Plan, it is
intended that 47,000 new social housing units will be delivered by 2021.

The total includes an Exchequer allocation of €50 million for the €200 million
**Local Infrastructure Housing Activation Fund** , to accelerate the provision
of public infrastructure to support the development of sites for private
housing in urban areas. It is hoped that this fund will facilitate the
delivery of up to 20,000 private houses by 2019.

In addition, local authorities will use €92 million from surplus Local
Property Tax receipts to fund a range of housing services.

####  Social housing support

A total capital provision of €732m has been allocated in 2017 to support the
delivery of 4,450 **social housing units** . These will be provided through
construction and acquisitions by local authorities and approved housing
bodies; Rapid Builds; Part V mechanisms; bringing an expected 800 vacant units
back into use; and delivering new units under the National Regeneration
Programme.

Under the **Social Housing Current Expenditure Programme** , a provision of
€84 million is to support the delivery of 600 direct leased units in 2017.

An additional €105 million is allocated for the Housing Assistance Payment

price will be available. For homes costing between €400,000 and €600,000, the
