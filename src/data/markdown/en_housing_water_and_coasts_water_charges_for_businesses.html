##  Introduction

Non-domestic water users must pay for the water they use. These charges differ
depending on whether the [ water supply
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/environment/water_services/water_supply.html)
comes from a group water scheme or the public water system. A new system of
charges has been approved and came into effect on 1 October 2021, see details
below in ‘Recent changes to non-domestic water charges’.

##  Commercial water charges

All commercial organisations and non-domestic customers must pay water charges
if water is being supplied for their use. Examples of non-domestic customers
includes hospitals, health centres, schools and clubs.

There are two types of accounts for commercial water charges, metered and
unmetered.

###  Unmetered accounts

This flat-rate charge is paid to Irish Water. The rate is calculated by
estimating how much water (and wastewater) your business uses. The volume of
water and wastewater will differ, depending on the type of business and the
number of employees. For example, a newsagent will be charged less than a
hairdresser because it uses less water. There is no minimum charge set down in
legislation. The rates were previously set by each local authority and
reviewed each year.

###  Metered accounts

A metered account involves a meter being fitted to monitor commercial water
usage. Commercial metered accounts are subject to a standing charge for water
and wastewater for the meter itself. The standing charge is usually paid on a
quarterly basis.

A domestic allowance is available where the water supply is used jointly for
domestic and commercial use. The domestic allowance can vary between local
authorities.

##  Businesses in group water schemes

Commercial premises (like farms or other rural businesses) that are members of
[ group water schemes ](/en/housing/water-and-coasts/water-charges-for-group-
schemes/) have to pay for the water they use for running their businesses.
They get a _standard domestic allowance_ to cover their domestic water usage.
In most cases, this usage is monitored by a water meter. The _standard
domestic allowance_ is deducted from the total usage to determine how much
water was used by the business.

If the business owner is in a public group water scheme, the local authority
will charge the business according to their usage at the set commercial rate.
If the business owner is in a private group water scheme, the group may charge
them according to their usage. Alternatively they can agree a fixed rate with
other group members.

##  Paying water charges

All commercial premises must pay their water charges, unless a personal
hardship waiver applies. If you do not pay, Irish Water can take you to the
District Court to recover the charges from you. Alternatively, it can
disconnect or restrict your water supply. However, this is rarely done because
of implications for health and safety.

Payments are now collected by Irish Water (previously the local authorities).

**Group water schemes** are responsible for monitoring themselves. Commercial
members of group schemes who do not pay their share of the maintenance costs
must be dealt with by the group and its trustees. It is up to the members and
trustees of group schemes to decide who should pay what and the grounds on
which charges can be waived or reduced.

If you are in a private group scheme and you are finding it difficult to make
your payments, you should discuss this with the trustees of the group.

###  **Recent changes** to non-domestic water charges

In 2019, Irish Water agreed a new [ Non-Domestic Tariff Framework
](https://www.water.ie/for-business/billing-explained/charges/) with the
Commission for Regulation of Utilities (CRU). This framework standardises non-
domestic water charges across local authorities and town councils, meaning
businesses will pay the same amount for their water nationwide. This new
system of charges have applied since 1 October 2021.
