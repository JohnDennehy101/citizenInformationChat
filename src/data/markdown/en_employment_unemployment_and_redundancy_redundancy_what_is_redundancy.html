##  When does redundancy happen?

Where you lose your job because your employer is closing the business or
reducing the number of staff, this is known as redundancy. It happens when
your job in the company no longer exists, you are let go and are not replaced.

###  Redundancy is a last option

Your employer must consult with you before deciding to make you redundant.
Redundancy is a last option and there must be valid economic, technical, or
organisational grounds justifying changes in the workforce.

Before your employer makes you redundant, they might offer you another job in
the business. This is known as ‘ [ alternative work
](/en/employment/unemployment-and-redundancy/redundancy/alternatives-to-
redundancy/) ’.

##  What counts as genuine redundancy?

Your employer must be able to justify that there is a genuine reason for
making you redundant.

A genuine redundancy is one where your employer has a real business reason to
make you redundant.

Reasons for redundancy include:

  * **Financial difficulties** within the business: for example, your employer needs to cut costs and this means staff numbers must be reduced. 
  * **Lack of work** : for example, your employer no longer needs or has a reduced need for employees with your skills or new technology has made your job unnecessary. 
  * **Reorganisation** within the business: for example, your employer has decided to carry on the business with fewer or no staff or the job you do no longer exists. 
  * **Business closure** : the business is closing down or moving. 

##  The difference between redundancy and dismissal

###  Redundancy

Redundancy is dismissal from your job, caused by your employer needing to
reduce the workforce resulting in your job no longer existing.

The burden of proof is on your employer to show that a legitimate redundancy
situation exists and that therefore the dismissal is fair.

For the dismissal to be fair, your employer must also show that you were [
fairly selected for redundancy ](/en/employment/unemployment-and-
redundancy/redundancy/redundancy-procedures/) and that fair procedures were
followed.

If you do not agree that the dismissal is fair, you need to show one or more
of the following:

  * That there is no economic justification for the redundancy 
  * The reasons you have been given for redundancy are not genuine 
  * You have been replaced 
  * Fair procedures have not been followed 
  * You were unfairly selected for redundancy (for example because of your age or race) 

###  Dismissal for other reasons

Your employer must have reasons that justify your dismissal. You may be
dismissed from your job for one of the following reasons:

  * Capability 
  * Competence 
  * Qualifications 
  * Conduct 

If you don’t think that your employer’s reasons are justified, you can bring a
claim for [ unfair dismissal ](/en/employment/unemployment-and-
redundancy/dismissal/unfair-dismissal/) .

##  Compulsory and non-compulsory redundancy

Before an employer formally goes through the redundancy procedure required by
legislation (compulsory redundancy), they can decide to offer a package to
encourage employees to volunteer to leave their roles.

This is sometimes known as non-compulsory redundancy. It is used to avoid the
compulsory redundancy process altogether or to reduce the numbers of employees
who will ultimately have to be made compulsorily redundant.

###  Compulsory redundancy

Compulsory redundancy is where your employer needs to reduce the workforce and
decides to make redundancies. The employer identifies which employees will be
made redundant but must make sure they use fair selection criteria.

###  Non-compulsory redundancy

Non-compulsory redundancy can be through voluntary redundancy or early
retirement.

####  Voluntary redundancy

This is where your employer needs to reduce the workforce and asks employees
if they would like to volunteer for redundancy.

There must be a fair and transparent selection process. You may not
automatically be selected just because you applied.

####  Early retirement

This is where your employer offers incentives to retire early. You are
typically allowed to start receiving some pension payments earlier than you
would have in a normal retirement situation. It can be used as an alternative
to voluntary redundancy.

##  Collective redundancies

You may be part of a _collective redundancy_ if your employer is making a
certain number of employees redundant during any period of 30 consecutive
days.

It is a collective redundancy where there is:

  * **5 employees** made redundant out of a workforce of **21 to 49** employees 
  * **10 employees** made redundant out of a workforce of **50 to 99** employees 
  * **10%** of employees made redundant out of a workforce of **100 to 299** employees 
  * **30** employees made redundant out of a workforce of **300** employees 

###  Rules on collective redundancies

Your employer must follow certain rules if there is a collective redundancy
situation.

####  Requirement to consult

Your employer must enter into consultations with a view to agreement with your
representative. These consultations must take place as soon as possible and at
least 30 days before the notice of redundancy is given. The aim of the
consultation is to consider whether there are any alternatives to the
redundancies.

These rules are set out in the [ Protection of Employment Acts 1977-2024
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1977/en/act/pub/0007/index.html) .

If your employer makes you redundant before the 30-day notice period ends, you
have the right to seek redress from the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC).

The [ Employees (Provision of Information and Consultation) Act 2006
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2006/en/act/pub/0009/index.html) also
requires employers to consult with employees on substantial changes in the
workplace, including proposals for collective redundancies. The Act applies to
employers of 50 people or more.

####  Information your employer must provide

Your employer must provide the following information in writing to your
representatives:

  * The reasons for the redundancy 
  * The number and descriptions of the employees affected 
  * The number and descriptions of employees normally employed 
  * The period in which the redundancies will happen 
  * The criteria for selection of employees for redundancy 
  * The method of calculating any redundancy payment 

Your employer must also inform the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and
Employment **in writing** of the proposed redundancies **at least 30 days
before the occurrence of the first redundancy** . [ SI 324/2024
](https://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2024/si/324/made/en/) sets out the
information your employer must provide to the Minister.

####  If your employer is insolvent

If your employer’s business becomes insolvent, a liquidator, provisional
liquidator, receiver or any other person, may be appointed by the courts to
manage the business.

They are called the ‘responsible person’, and they take the place of your
employer in the consultations.

The rules on collective redundancies which apply to your employer, also apply
to the responsible person.

Responsible persons can continue consultations started by your employer. They
don’t have to restart the 30-days’ notice after their appointment.

These rules are set out in the [ Employment (Collective Redundancies and
Miscellaneous Provisions) and Companies (Amendment) Act 2024
](https://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2024/act/14/enacted/en/index.html) .

You can read more in the [ Information Handbook: Rights and Remedies available
to Employees Facing a Collective Redundancy Situation
](https://enterprise.gov.ie/en/publications/publication-files/information-
handbook-rights-and-remedies-available-to-employees-facing-a-collective-
redundancy-situation.pdf) .

##  Lay off and short-time working

If there is a lack of work available or changes to the financial circumstances
of the business, your employer may lay you off or reduce your working hours
(put you on short-time) for a number of weeks.

A lay-off is when your employer tells you that they expect you to have **no
work** for a temporary period and you will not be paid.

Short-time working is when your hours and pay **are reduced** due to a
decrease in work.

In some cases when you have been in a [ lay off or short-time working
](/en/employment/unemployment-and-redundancy/redundancy/lay-off-short-time-
working-and-redundancy/) situation for a certain length of time you may be
entitled to claim redundancy.

##  Redundancy during sick leave, maternity leave and carer’s leave

###  You are made redundant on sick leave

If your employer decides to make you redundant while you are on sick leave,
you may be able to bring a claim for [ unfair dismissal
](/en/employment/unemployment-and-redundancy/dismissal/unfair-dismissal/) .

Unless your employer can prove there was a [ genuine redundancy situation
](/en/employment/unemployment-and-redundancy/redundancy/redundancy-
procedures/) and that fair procedures were followed, your dismissal may be
found to be unfair.

Even if a genuine redundancy situation exists, you may bring a claim for
unfair dismissal if you think that you were unfairly selected for redundancy.
Your employer should apply selection criteria that are reasonable and are
applied in a fair way.

###  You are made redundant on maternity leave

You cannot be made redundant while on [ maternity leave or additional
maternity leave ](/en/employment/employment-rights-and-conditions/leave-and-
holidays/maternity-leave/) . You may be made redundant when you return to work
or while you are pregnant before you go on maternity leave.

If you are selected for redundancy because you are pregnant, you may be able
to bring a claim for unfair dismissal. Selection for redundancy based on
certain grounds such as pregnancy is considered unfair under the unfair
dismissals legislation.

###  You are made redundant on carer’s leave

If you are dismissed on grounds of redundancy, while on [ carer’s leave
](/en/employment/employment-rights-and-conditions/leave-and-holidays/carers-
leave/) , under the Carer’s Leave Act 2001 it would be considered unfair
dismissal.

If your employer does not allow you to return to work at the end of your
carer’s leave you may be able to bring a claim under the unfair dismissals
legislation. However you may be made redundant after you have returned to
work.

##  I think I was unfairly selected or there wasn’t a genuine redundancy
situation

If you feel that your employer has selected you unfairly, or that there was no
genuine redundancy situation, you can bring a claim for unfair dismissal.

###  You think you were unfairly selected

Your employer should use fair and reasonable selection criteria in choosing
people to make redundant.

Examples where your selection could be unfair include:

  * Where the custom and practice in your workplace has been last in, first out and your selection did not follow this procedure 
  * Where your employment contract sets out criteria for selection which were not followed 

Your redundancy is unfair if your employer has [ discriminated in selecting
you ](/en/employment/equality-in-work/equality-in-the-workplace/) for
redundancy. For example if they make you redundant because you’re pregnant or
on maternity leave.

Your employer could also have chosen you for an unfair reason. Unfair reasons
include making you redundant because you’ve asked for one of your legal
rights, made a health and safety complaint or been on an official strike.

###  You think there was no genuine redundancy situation

A genuine redundancy is one where your employer has a real business reason to
make you redundant.

Signs your redundancy might not be a genuine include:

  * Your employer has recently hired new employees to do similar work 
  * You have a bad relationship with your employer or other people at work 
  * You are singled out or treated differently from other people at work 

##  The laws on redundancy

The laws on redundancy are set out in the [ Redundancy Payments Acts 1967–2014
](http://www.lawreform.ie/_fileupload/RevisedActs/WithAnnotations/HTML/EN_ACT_1967_0021.htm)
.

The requirements to consult on collective redundancies are set out in the [
Protection of Employment Acts 1977-2024
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1977/en/act/pub/0007/index.html) as amended,
and the [ Employees (Provision of Information and Consultation) Act 2006.
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2006/en/act/pub/0009/index.html)
