##  What is the Local Authority Purchase and Renovation Loan?

The [ Local Authority Purchase and Renovation Loan
](https://www.gov.ie/en/press-release/97db0-local-authority-purchase-and-
renovation-loan-to-support-first-time-buyers-turn-vacant-or-derelict-
buildings-into-new-homes/) (LAPR) is a government-backed mortgage and loan
that helps you to buy and renovate a derelict or uninhabitable home.

The loan is for first-time buyers, and ‘fresh start applicants’, who have been
unable to get funding from commercial lenders. It is an extension of the [
Local Authority Home Loan ](/ga/housing/owning-a-home/help-with-buying-a-
home/local-authority-mortgages/) .

You must qualify for the [ Vacant Property Refurbishment Grant
](/ga/housing/housing-grants-and-schemes/local-authority-housing-grants-and-
supports/vacant-property-refurbishment-grant/) to get this loan.

The loan has 2 parts, a fixed rate mortgage loan and a variable rate bridging
loan. The interest-only bridging loan is for the amount you’ve been approved
for the Vacant Property Refurbishment Grant. You pay the bridging loan back as
soon as you get the grant.

The [ Local Authority Purchase and Renovation Loan website
](https://purchaseandrenovationloan.ie/) has more information about the loan
including an [ FAQ ](https://purchaseandrenovationloan.ie/faq/) and a [ loan
calculator ](https://purchaseandrenovationloan.ie/calculator/) .

##  How much can I borrow?

The amount you can borrow depends on:

  * Your household’s borrowing capacity. You need to show that you can afford your monthly mortgage repayments, which must be less than 35% of your net household income. 
  * The loan to value for the home you are buying 
  * The Vacant Property Refurbishment Grant amount you have been approved for 
  * The level of renovation work you need for your home and the project viability 
  * The estimated value of your home 

The value of your home for this loan is taken as the projected value of the
property after the renovations are done. This value cannot exceed the maximum
market property values for the Local Authority Home Loan in your area.

The maximum value is different depending on where your home is located:

  * €360,000 in Dublin, Kildare, Wicklow 
  * €330,000 in Cork, Galway, Louth, Meath 
  * €300,000 in Clare, Kilkenny, Limerick, Waterford, Westmeath, Wexford 
  * €275,000 in Carlow, Cavan, Donegal, Kerry, Laois, Leitrim, Longford, Mayo, Monaghan, Offaly, Roscommon, Sligo, Tipperary 

There are also 3 project types for the loan:

  * **Vacant property and minor works:** you can apply for 90% of the purchase price and renovation work for these projects. 
  * **Vacant property and major works:** you can apply for 85% of the purchase price of the home and 90% of the renovation costs for these projects 
  * **Derelict:** you must qualify for the derelict top-up of the Vacant Homes Refurbishment Grant for this type. You can apply for 80% of the purchase price of the home and 90% of the renovation costs. 

There are different maximum amounts you can borrow depending on the project
type you are applying for. See [ these limits on the Local Authority Purchase
and Renovation Loan website ](https://purchaseandrenovationloan.ie/borrowing/)
.

You can use the [ calculator on the Purchase and Renovation Loan website
](https://purchaseandrenovationloan.ie/calculator/) to get an estimate of how
much you can borrow and what your repayments will be.

##  What are the interest rates?

The Local Authority Purchase and Renovation Loan is made up of 2 parts, a
mortgage and a bridging loan. The mortgage and the bridging loan have
different terms and interest rates.

**1\. Interest rates for the mortgage part of the loan are fixed at:**

  * 4.00% for loans up to 25 years (APR 4.07%) 
  * 4.05% for loans over 25 years and up to 30 years (APR 4.13%) 

**Note:** The interest rates for the Local Authority Purchase and Renovation
Loan can change from time to time. You will get the interest rate that is
available when you drawdown your loan and this rate is set for the term of
your loan.

A fixed interest rate means that your monthly repayments remain the same for
the term of the loan. You can pay off all or part of your mortgage, but you
may have to pay a breakage fee.

You must sign up to the local authority collective Mortgage Protection
Insurance (MPI) scheme. You pay MPI monthly in addition to your loan
repayments.

**2\. Interest rates for the bridging loan are:**

  * 3.5% interest only variable rate for 2 years 

The bridging loan is an interest only loan. You can get your bridging loan for
the amount you’ve been approved for with the Vacant Property Refurbishment
Grant. The bridging loan must be repaid once the grant is paid out.
