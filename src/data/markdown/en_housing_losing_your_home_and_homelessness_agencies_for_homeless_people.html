##  Introduction

This page lists a number of agencies and organisations that provide services
to people who are homeless or at risk of homelessness. While they are listed
under the main type of service provided, many of these bodies provide multiple
supports to homeless people, including advice and information on other options
available to them.

A growing number of people are either homeless or at risk of losing their
homes. Most of them are in the cities. There are dedicated services for
homeless people in Dublin and Cork.

###  Housing First

The [ Housing First Service ](https://www.housingagency.ie/housing-
information/housing-first) provides street outreach to people who are sleeping
rough and helps them to access emergency accommodation. It also works to
secure longer-term accommodation with wrap-around supports for people who are
sleeping rough or have been in emergency accommodation for a long time. These
wrap-around supports can include health supports to help with addiction or
mental health issues.

##  Accessing social welfare payments

In general, you make any claims for social welfare payments such as [
Jobseeker’s Allowance ](/en/social-welfare/unemployed-people/jobseekers-
allowance/) ; for [ illness and disability payments ](/en/social-
welfare/disability-and-illness/benefits-to-people-who-are-sick-or-have-a-
disability/) ; for [ Rent Supplement ](/en/social-welfare/supplementary-
welfare-schemes/rent-supplement/) and for other [ Supplementary Welfare
Allowance ](/en/social-welfare/supplementary-welfare-schemes/) payments in the
normal way.

In Dublin, there is a Homeless Persons Unit (HPU) to deal with claims for
Supplementary Welfare Allowance. The unit can also provide information on
other services that may be relevant to your circumstances.

**Homeless Persons Unit - Dublin**

Community Welfare Service, Department of Social Protection, Elizabeth
O’Farrell House, North Cumberland Street, Dublin 1, D01 NX32.

**You must make an appointment to access this service.** Freephone 1800 724
724 to make an appointment. If you need an in-person appointment, it will be
scheduled between 9:30am – 1pm.

You can collect an application pack at the HPU without an appointment.

If you have a question about this service, email: [ HPU@welfare.ie
](mailto:HPU@welfare.ie) .
