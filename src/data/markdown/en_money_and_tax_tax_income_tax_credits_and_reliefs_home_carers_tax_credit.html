#  Home Carer Tax Credit

  * Introduction 
  * Rules 
  * Rates 
  * How to apply 

##  Introduction

If you are married or in a civil partnership and you care for a dependent
person, you can apply for the Home Carer Tax Credit. You must be [ jointly
assessed for tax ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/money-and-
tax/tax/income-tax/taxation-of-married-people/#0b1920) as a couple.

When you get a tax credit, it reduces the tax you pay by the amount of the
credit.

Read more about [ how your tax is calculated ](/en/money-and-tax/tax/income-
tax/how-your-tax-is-calculated/) .

##  Rules

The full amount of the Home Carer Tax Credit can be claimed when:

  * A married couple or civil partners are jointly assessed for tax 
  * One spouse or civil partner cares for one or more dependent people (see below) 
  * The home carer’s own income is under €7,200. A reduced tax credit applies if their income is between €7,200 and €10,800 (€10,600 in 2023). 

[ Carer’s Allowance ](/en/social-welfare/carers/carers-allowance/) or [
Carer's Benefit ](/en/social-welfare/carers/carers-benefit/) are **not** taken
into account when determining the home carer’s income but they are taxable
sources of income. This means that if you are claiming Carer's Allowance or
Carer's Benefit, it will make up part of your jointly assessed income.

###  Who is a dependent person?

A dependent person is a:

  * Child who you get [ Child Benefit ](/en/social-welfare/families-and-children/child-benefit/) for 
  * Person aged 65 or over 
  * Person who is permanently incapacitated due to a disability 

A dependent person you are caring for **cannot be a spouse or civil partner.**
They can however, be a relative by marriage, or someone for whom you act as a
legal guardian.

###  Does the person being cared for have to live in our home?

If you care for a person who is not a relative, and not a relative of your
spouse or civil partner, then they do have to live in your home.

If the dependent person is a relative, they can be cared for outside your
home. However, if the person is not living with you they must live either

  * Next door in a neighbouring residence 
  * On the same property 
  * Within 2 kilometres of your home 

There must be a direct communication link between you (for example, telephone
or alarm system).

##  Rates

The Home Carer Tax Credit is €1,800 (€1,700 in 2023).

If the home carer has an income of up to €7,200 in their own right for the tax
year, the full tax credit may be claimed.

**Reduced tax credit**

If the home carer's income exceeds €7,200, the amount of their income over
€7,200 is halved and the tax credit is reduced by that amount. The following
table gives examples of how the tax credit is calculated for different levels
of income in 2024.

If the home carer's income is €10,800 or more, then you cannot claim the tax
credit.

**Income of Home Carer, €** |  **Tax credit, €** |  **Reduction in tax credit, €**  
---|---|---  
7,200  |  1,800  |  No reduction - the full tax credit is due   
7,450  |  1,675  |  7,450 - 7,200 = 250 ÷ 2 = 125   
7,700  |  1,550  |  7,700 - 7,200 = 500 ÷ 2 = 250   
7,950  |  1,425  |  7,950 - 7,200 = 750 ÷ 2 = 375   
8,200  |  1,300  |  8,200 - 7,200 = 1,000 ÷ 2 = 500   
8,450  |  1,175  |  8,450 - 7,200 = 1,250 ÷ 2 = 625   
8,700  |  1050  |  8,700 - 7,200 = 1,500 ÷ 2 = 750   
8,950  |  925  |  8,950 - 7,200 = 1,750 ÷ 2 = 875   
9,200  |  800  |  9,200 - 7,200 = 2,000 ÷ 2 = 1,000   
9,450  |  675  |  9,450 - 7,200 = 2,250 ÷ 2 = 1,125   
9,700  |  550  |  9,700 - 7,200 = 2,500 ÷ 2 = 1,250   
9,950  |  425  |  9,950 – 7,200 = 2,750 ÷ 2 = 1,375   
10,200  |  300  |  10,200 - 7,200 = 3,000 ÷ 2 = 1,500   
10,400  |  200  |  10,400 - 7,200 = 3,200 ÷ 2 = 1,600   
10,600  |  100  |  10,600 – 7,200 = 3,400 ÷ 2 = 1,700   
10,800  |  0  |  10,800 – 7,200 = 3,600 ÷ 2 = 1,800   
  
You cannot claim the increased Standard Rate Cut-Off Point for dual income
couples **and** the Home Carer Tax Credit **.** Your Revenue office can help
you decide which is better for you **.**
