  * How can WEEE damage the environment? 
  * Recycling WEEE 
  * Will local authorities take my WEEE? 
  * How is the WEEE recycling scheme funded?

##  What is Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE)?

Anything that needs a battery or a power supply to work is considered
electrical and electronic equipment (EEE). Waste Electrical and Electronic
Equipment (WEEE) is electrical and electronic equipment that is broken or not
wanted anymore.

It is important to dispose of anything that runs on electricity, or that
contains electrical parts, responsibly to avoid damaging the environment.

Common electrical and electronic waste items include:

  * Large household appliances, such as fridges, freezers, washing machines, dishwashers 
  * Small household appliances, such as toasters, coffee makers, irons, hairdryers 
  * Information technology (IT) and telecommunications equipment, such as PCs, phones, laptops, printers, scanners, photocopiers 
  * Consumer equipment, such as TVs, stereo equipment, electric toothbrushes 
  * Lighting equipment, such as fluorescent lamps 
  * Electrical and electronic tools, such as handheld drills, saws, screwdrivers 
  * Toys, leisure and sports equipment 
  * Medical equipment systems (except implanted or infected products) 
  * Monitoring and control instruments 
  * Automatic dispensers 
  * Batteries and accumulators 

##  How can WEEE damage the environment?

The main risks to the environment from WEEE are the depletion of natural
resources and the release of dangerous substances.

If we send electrical and electronic products to landfill sites instead of
recycling them, we miss the opportunity to recover and reuse millions of
tonnes of materials. If we recycle these materials, this means we need to
extract less raw material to manufacture new products.

Some electronic equipment contains substances that are considered dangerous to
the environment and human health if they arenâ€™t disposed of properly.

Although these dangerous substances are usually present in only small amounts,
they may leak into the soil, water or air and can cause serious environmental
damage.

##  Recycling WEEE

###  **Where can I recycle WEEE?**

Companies that produce electrical and electronic goods must cover the cost of
collecting, treating, recovering and disposing of WEEE in an environmentally
friendly way.

This means you can return your household WEEE free of charge, either to a shop
when buying a replacement item, or to another authorised collection point,
such as a local authority civic amenity site.

WEEE Ireland have an [ interactive map ](https://www.weeeireland.ie/household-
recycling/where-can-i-recycle/) which can help you find the best place to go
to recycle your WEEE. Mywaste.ie also have a similar [ interactive map
](https://www.mywaste.ie/waste-service-locator/) which you can use.

WEEE should **not** be put in landfill sites because of the harmful substances
it contains.

###  **Will electrical shops take back my WEEE?**

Retailers must take back your old electrical and electronic equipment in store
for free on a one-for-one, like-for-like basis. This means the old product
must be the same type or have the same purpose as the new item you are
purchasing.

Retailers in large stores (with an electrical-goods sales area greater than
400 square metres) must accept your small appliances (less than 25 cm high)
for recycling without insisting you buy anything.

You can return certain types of waste batteries at various shops for free, as
well as any local authority civic amenity site.

###  **Recycling batteries**

Batteries should be disposed of carefully and not sent to landfill because
they are classed as hazardous waste.

You can return used batteries free of charge at:

  * Any local authority civic amenity site 
  * Any shop selling the same type of battery 

However, you can also bring them to a Blue Battery Box to be recycled. You can
find Blue Battery Boxes in:

  * Local recycling centres 
  * Newsagents 
  * Supermarkets 
  * Schools 
  * Workplaces 

Retailers must take back batteries of a type they supply, even if you did not
get the batteries from them. You do not have to buy anything from the shop
when you are depositing waste batteries.

However, retailers do not have to take back batteries of a type they do not
supply. For example, they do not have to take back a car battery if they only
sell batteries suitable for a torch or remote control.

Retailers do not have to accept contaminated waste that could be a health and
safety risk to their staff, such as leaking batteries.

###  **Recycling vapes and e-cigarettes**

Most vapes and e-cigarettes have batteries so they should not be put in your
bin at home. Instead, you should bring them to a Blue Battery Box to be
recycled.

You may also be able to return your vape or e-cigarette to the store where you
bought it.

This recycling service is free and is provided by [ Waste Electrical and
Electronic Equipment (WEEE) Ireland ](https://www.weeeireland.ie/) .

Disposable vapes do not need to be taken apart to be recycled. However, to
recycle rechargeable vapes or e-cigarettes, you need remove the tank where the
liquid is stored before you recycle it.

WEEE has [ more information about how to recycle vapes and e-cigarettes
](https://www.weeeireland.ie/vape-e-cigarette-device-recycling/) .

###  **What if I want something delivered to my home?**

If you are having an electrical appliance delivered to your home, you can have
the old item collected at the same time for no extra cost.

The retailer cannot charge for collecting the waste equipment, although they
can charge a delivery fee for the new item.

Retailers must give 24 hoursâ€™ notice of delivery and you must have the old
item ready to be collected. This means the item must be clean, empty and
disconnected from all electrical, gas or water systems (if appropriate).

If a retailer has not given 24 hoursâ€™ notice of delivery and an old appliance
is not ready for collection, they must return to collect it within 15 days.

If you donâ€™t want to use the free collection service when your new equipment
is delivered, you can return your old item to the shop at any time.

##  Will local authorities take my WEEE?

Local authorities have initiatives for handling WEEE in their general waste
management plans.

You can take your WEEE free of charge to your local civic amenity site, where
it will be collected for recycling instead of being sent to a landfill site.

For information on initiatives in your area and for advice on how to deal with
WEEE, contact your [ local authority
](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/942f74-local-authorities/) .

##  How is the WEEE recycling scheme funded?

Visible Environmental Management Costs (vEMCs) are standardised charges added
to the price of certain new items to help cover the costs of recycling them.

You will see a vEMC on the price display on all:

  * Refrigeration units 
  * Large household appliances 
  * TVs larger than 73cm 
  * Gas discharge lamps 
  * LEDs 

The retail price of the item includes the vEMC. The vEMCs displayed on the
goods you buy cannot be more than the actual costs of recycling them.

These charges fund:

  * WEEE Ireland 
  * European Recycling Platform 

These schemes ensure that all household WEEE is handled without causing harm
to the environment when it is returned to retailers or deposited at landfill
sites or civic amenity sites.

The rate is approved by the [ Producer Register Ltd
](https://www.producerregister.ie/what-we-do) , which is an industry-based but
independently managed national registration body.

For more information on EMCs, go to the [ Product Register
](https://www.producerregister.ie/) .

##  More information on WEEE

WEEE Ireland have [ more information about how WEEE is managed and recycled
](https://www.weeeireland.ie/) .

There is specific legislation for WEEE. This includes the [ WEEE Directive
2012/19/EU ](http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-
content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32012L0019) , which updated the first WEEE Directive
( [ Directive 2002/96/EC ](http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-
content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32002L0096) ).
