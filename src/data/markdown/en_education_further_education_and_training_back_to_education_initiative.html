##  What is the Back to Education Initiative?

The Back to Education Initiative (BTEI) provides part-time further education
courses mainly for young people and adults who have not completed the Leaving
Certificate or an equivalent qualification. The courses are free from some
participants - see 'Free courses' below.

It gives you the opportunity to combine learning with family, work and other
responsibilities. Anyone who has left full-time education can take part in a
course, but priority will be given to those without a Leaving Certificate.

BTEI courses are usually level 3 and 4 on the [ National Qualification
Framework (NFQ) ](http://www.nfq.ie/nfq/en/FanDiagram/nqai_nfq_08.html) . The
[ BTEI ](https://www.gov.ie/en/service/24e75-back-to-education-initiative/)
allows you to study part-time (up to 400 hours per year). It is possible to
get a major award at NFQ levels 1-6 when part-time courses are combined to
complete a major award.

##  Who can qualify for the Back to Education Initiative?

The Back to Education Initiative (BTEI) provides part-time courses for adults
and young people aged over 16 who left school with few or no formal
qualifications or low literacy levels.

The groups given priority access to the BTEI are listed in the [ Back to
Education Initiative Operational Guidelines (pdf)
](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/f4113d-operational-guidelines-back-to-
education-part-time-education-option/) . Within these groups, priority is
given to people most educationally disadvantaged.

You can also take part in BTEI if you are working and on a low income. The aim
of BTEI is to give people an opportunity to combine their learning with
family, work and other commitments.

###  Free courses

You will qualify for free tuition with BTEI if you:

  * Have less than upper-second level education or 
  * Are getting a jobseeker’s payment or means-tested social welfare payment (there is a list of eligible payments in the [ BTEI Operational Guidelines (pdf) ](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/f4113d-operational-guidelines-back-to-education-part-time-education-option/) ) or 
  * Are getting [ Working Family Payment ](/en/social-welfare/families-and-children/working-family-payment/) or 
  * Have a [ medical card ](/en/health/medical-cards-and-gp-visit-cards/medical-card/) or 
  * Are eligible to participate on [ VTOS ](/en/education/further-education-and-training/vocational-training-opportunities-scheme/) or [ Youthreach. ](/en/education/further-education-and-training/youthreach/)

All other participants are charged a fee. For information about fees, you
should contact your local [ Education and Training Board
](http://www.etbi.ie/etbs/directory-of-etbs/) .

##  Training allowances for Back to Education Initiative

In general, a training allowance is not paid, but a pro-rata training
allowance may be paid to a participant who is not entitled to a social welfare
payment but is eligible for [ Youthreach ](/en/education/further-education-
and-training/youthreach/) .

If you are getting a social welfare payment, you can keep your payment and
participate in BTEI as long as you continue to satisfy the conditions attached
to your payment. If you are getting a jobseeker’s payment you will need to
apply for the [ Part-Time Education Option ](/en/social-welfare/back-to-
education/part-time-education-option/) .
