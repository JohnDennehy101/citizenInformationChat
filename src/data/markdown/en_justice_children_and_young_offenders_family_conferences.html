##  Introduction

When a [ child is charged with an offence ](/en/justice/children-and-young-
offenders/children-and-the-criminal-justice-system-in-ireland/) , the court
can order that a family conference be held. A family conference is a meeting
run by [ Young Persons Probation ](/en/justice/probation-and-welfare-
services/probation-service/) . The meeting includes the child charged with the
offence, members of the child’s family, the victim(s) and other relevant
people. At the meeting, everyone will talk about the offence and its effect on
the victim, the community and on the child’s family. The goal is to come up
with a plan that will help the child avoid getting into trouble in the future.

The legislation governing family conferences is the [ Children Act, 2001-2021
](https://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2001/act/24/enacted/en/index.html)

##  Ordering the family conference

When the court (usually the [ Children Court ](/en/justice/courts-
system/children-court/) ) orders a family conference to be held the court
proceedings are adjourned until the conference is completed.

The Court orders a family conference when:

  * The child accepts responsibility for their criminal behaviour 
  * The court believes that an action plan should be devised 
  * The child and the child’s parents or guardians agree to participate in the conference 

##  Conference meeting

A probation officer must arrange the family conference within 28 days of being
told to do so by the court. The child and the child’s family attend the
meeting. The victim may attend. Other relevant people may also attend, such as
a teacher or social worker.

At the meeting, the group will talk about how the child’s offence affected the
victim, the community and the child’s family. Then the group will think of
ways that the child can take responsibility for their behaviour and make good
the harm done. The process is based on the principles of [ restorative
justice. ](https://restorativejustice.ie/)

##  Action plan

During the meeting, the child and their family meet privately to draft an
action plan that is designed to make amends and to help the child stay out of
trouble. The draft action plan is then discussed by the full group at the
meeting and agreed. If the group cannot agree on an action plan the court may
write their own or resume the court proceedings.

The agreed action plan is submitted to court for approval. The court can amend
the plan. If the court approves the plan it may be supervised by a probation
officer.

The court will set a date no more than 6 months later to review if the child
has completed the action plan. If the court rules that the plan is not
completed the court can deal with the case in some other way, for example [
detention ](/en/justice/children-and-young-offenders/detention-of-children/)
or [ community sanctions ](/en/justice/children-and-young-offenders/community-
sanctions-for-young-offenders/) . If the court is satisfied that the child has
completed the plan, it may dismiss the charge against the child.
