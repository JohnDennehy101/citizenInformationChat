  * Further Information 

##  Introduction

If you have a medical condition covered by the Long-Term Illness Scheme, you
can get free drugs, medicines and medical and surgical appliances for the
treatment of that condition.

You must be [ ordinarily resident ](/en/health/health-system/entitlement-to-
public-health-services#l2b820) in Ireland to qualify. This means that you are
living here and intend to live here for at least one year. Students from
outside the EU do not qualify for the Long-Term Illness Scheme.

The Long-Term Illness Scheme does not depend on your income or other
circumstances. You may also be eligible for a [ Medical card
](/en/health/medical-cards-and-gp-visit-cards/medical-card/) or [ GP visit
card ](/en/health/medical-cards-and-gp-visit-cards/gp-visit-cards/) ,
depending on your circumstances.

##  Rules for the Long-Term Illness Scheme

The medical conditions that qualify under the Long-Term Illness Scheme are:

  * Intellectual disability 
  * Mental illness (for people under 16 only) 
  * Diabetes insipidus 
  * Diabetes mellitus 
  * Haemophilia 
  * Cerebral palsy 
  * Phenylketonuria 
  * Epilepsy 
  * Cystic fibrosis 
  * Multiple sclerosis 
  * Spina bifida 
  * Muscular dystrophies 
  * Hydrocephalus 
  * Parkinsonism 
  * Acute leukaemia 
  * Conditions arising from use of Thalidomide 

If you qualify, you will get a long-term illness card.

You do not have to pay a prescription charge for drugs you are approved for
under the Long-Term Illness Scheme. Other drugs and medicines not related to
the specified condition must be paid for in the normal way

If your doctor or [ occupational therapist ](/en/health/health-services/care-
in-your-community/occupational-therapy-services/) prescribes a medical or
surgical appliance, it will be supplied to you from your Local Health Office.

This scheme is administered by the Health Service Executive (HSE), under [
Section 59 of the Health Act 1970.
](https://revisedacts.lawreform.ie/eli/1970/act/1/section/59/revised/en/html)

###  Drug Payment Scheme

If you don't have a medical card, or a GP visit card or a medical condition
listed above, you can use the [ Drugs Payment Scheme ](/en/health/drugs-and-
medicines/drugs-payment-scheme/) to limit your expenses on prescription drugs.
