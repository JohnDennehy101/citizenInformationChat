##  Introduction

Irish citizens do not have an automatic entitlement to bring [ family members
who are not nationals ](/en/moving-country/moving-to-ireland/rights-of-
residence-in-ireland/residence-rights-of-family-members#l65f35) of the [
European Economic Area (EEA) ](https://www.efta.int/eea) , EU, UK or
Switzerland to live in Ireland. If you are returning to Ireland with your non-
EEA spouse or non-EEA civil partner, your spouse or civil partner must get
permission from the Irish Immigration Service Delivery (ISD) to live with you
in Ireland.

If your spouse or civil partner is a citizen of Ukraine, they **do not need a
visa or preclearance** . You can read [ coming to Ireland from Ukraine
](/en/moving-country/asylum-seekers-and-refugees/the-asylum-process-in-
ireland/coming-to-ireland-from-ukraine/) for more information.

This page is a step-by-step guide to the immigration process for your non-EEA
spouse or civil partner. We also have a [ step by step guide if you are
returning with your non-EEA de-facto partner ](/en/returning-to-
ireland/residency-and-citizenship/returning-to-ireland-with-your-de-facto-
partner/) .

You can no longer register a civil partnership in Ireland. Civil partnerships
registered abroad after 16 May 2016 are not recognised as civil partnerships
in Ireland. Under the [ Marriage Act 2015
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2015/act/35/enacted/en/html) , same-sex
couples can get married in Ireland. Same-sex marriages which were registered
abroad before the Marriage Act 2015 are also recognised in Ireland.

##  Step 1: Check if your partner needs a visa to enter Ireland

If your spouse or civil partner is a citizen of a non-EEA country, they may
need to apply for a visa before they can travel to Ireland . You can use the
ISD website to [ check if they need a visa.
](https://www.irishimmigration.ie/visa-non-visa-required-nationalities/)

If your spouse or civil partner needs a visa, they must apply for a [ Join
Family Member (D) visa ](https://www.visas.inis.gov.ie/avats/OnlineHome.aspx)
online. If your spouse’s or civil partner’s visa application is refused, they
can [ appeal this decision ](https://www.irishimmigration.ie/appeal-a-
negative-decision/) .

If they do not need a visa, they can travel to Ireland without a visa or
preclearance. However, all citizens of non-EEA countries, whether they need a
visa or not, must go through border control at point of entry (which is
usually the airport) when they arrive in Ireland, see 'Prepare for border
control' below.

##  Step 2: Send in the visa application

If your spouse or civil partner needs a visa, they must complete the [ online
application form ](https://www.visas.inis.gov.ie/avats/OnlineHome.aspx) . They
will need to print it out, sign it and gather several [ supporting documents
](https://www.irishimmigration.ie/coming-to-join-family-in-ireland/joining-an-
irish-national/join-family-visa/#guidehttps://www.irishimmigration.ie/coming-
to-join-family-in-ireland/joining-an-irish-national/de-facto-partner-of-an-
irish-national/) to send in with the application.

Your partner must submit these documents and signed application form **within
30 days** of submitting the online application. Some embassies and consulates
have [ additional requirements ](https://www.vfsglobalirelandvisa.com/) . At
the end of the online application they will be given a summary application
form.

This will include:

  * The address to send the signed form and supporting documents to (usually the Irish Embassy or Consulate nearest to them) 
  * Details of the [ fee ](https://www.irishimmigration.ie/preclearance-and-entry-visas-fees/) and how to pay 
  * The reference number for their application 

####  How do I apply for my children?

Children (under the age of 18) apply for a visa in a similar way to adults
using the online form. Their birth certificate must be submitted with the
application. ISD has information on [ visa applications for children aged
under 18 ](https://www.irishimmigration.ie/coming-to-join-family-in-
ireland/joining-an-irish-national/join-family-visa/#app) .

####  **Checking the progress of the application**

Your spouse or partner can use their reference number to check the progress of
the application. [ Decisions at the Dublin Visa Office are published on the
ISD website ](https://www.irishimmigration.ie/visa-decisions/) by reference
number. If their application was sent to a [ visa office outside of Ireland
](https://www.irishimmigration.ie/visa-offices/) , they should contact that
office for processing information.

Your partner should be aware of processing times for preclearance and visa
applications. They are advised **not to make any travel arrangements until
they get a decision on their visa or preclearance** .

If your partner’s application is refused, they can appeal this decision within
8 weeks of the date of the refusal letter. The appeal process is free and they
can appeal once. The appeal should address the reasons for refusal stated in
the refusal letter and provide extra supporting documents if possible. The
refusal letter will say where your appeal should be sent.

Your partner cannot travel to Ireland until their visa is granted or their
preclearance letter is received.

##  Step 3: Prepare for border control

All citizens of non-EEA countries, whether they need a visa or not, must go
through border control at point of entry (which is usually the airport) when
they arrive in Ireland. At border control an immigration officer examines your
spouse’s or civil partner’s documents. The immigration officer will then
decide if your spouse or civil partner is allowed to enter the country.

Your spouse or civil partner should tell the immigration officer that they
plan to apply for residency in Ireland, based on their relationship with you.

At border control, your spouse or civil partner will be asked for the
following documents at a minimum:

  * Valid passport 
  * D Visa (if they are from a visa-required country) 
  * Marriage or civil partnership certificate 

If your spouse or civil partner is allowed to enter Ireland, the immigration
officer will place a landing stamp in their passport. The landing stamp gives
them permission to stay in Ireland up to the date indicated or to a maximum of
3 months.

You can read more about [ getting permission to enter Ireland ](/en/moving-
country/visas-for-ireland/permission-to-land-in-ireland/) .

##  Step 4: Register with immigration and apply for residency

Your spouse or civil partner must be **in Ireland** before they can register
with immigration authorities and apply for residency permission. Residency
permission allows your non-EEA spouse or civil partner to live with you in
Ireland.

Your spouse or civil partner must register with the immigration authorities
within 90 days of their arrival in Ireland or within the time specified on the
landing stamp (which may be for less than 90 days) provided at border control.

####  **Registering**

If your spouse or civil partner is [ living in Cork, Dublin, Kildare,
Limerick, Meath, or Wicklow ](https://www.irishimmigration.ie/registering-
your-immigration-permission/how-to-register-your-immigration-permission-for-
the-first-time/information-on-registering-if-living-in-dublin-kildare-meath-
or-wicklow/) , they must phone 1800 800 630 to [ make an appointment
](https://burghquayregistrationoffice.inis.gov.ie/) to register at the [ Burgh
Quay Registration Office ](https://www.irishimmigration.ie/burgh-quay-
appointments/) . This Freephone number is open from 9am to 5pm, Monday to
Friday. To make an appointment they will need their passport and a valid email
address.

If your spouse or civil partner is [ living outside Cork, Dublin, Kildare,
Limerick, Meath, or Wicklow ](https://www.irishimmigration.ie/registering-
your-immigration-permission/how-to-register-your-immigration-permission-for-
the-first-time/information-on-registering-if-living-outside-of-dublin-kildare-
meath-and-wicklow/) , call or email the [ local registration office
](http://www.garda.ie/stations/default.aspx) for an appointment.

You and your spouse/civil partner are required to attend the appointment
together and should bring the following:

  * Your original marriage or civil partnership certificate (not a photocopy) 
  * Your original passport (not a photocopy) 
  * Your spouse’s or civil partner’s original passport (not a photocopy) 
  * Evidence of your joint address in Ireland 
  * Evidence of financial means 
  * Registration fee of €300 

At the appointment, your partner will have their fingerprints and photo taken.
ISD provides more information about [ what happens at the registration office
](https://www.irishimmigration.ie/registering-your-immigration-permission/how-
to-register-your-immigration-permission-for-the-first-time/information-on-
registering-if-living-outside-of-dublin-kildare-meath-and-wicklow/#during) .

**If residency permission is granted**

The Registration Officer will put a [ Stamp 4
](https://www.irishimmigration.ie/registering-your-immigration-
permission/information-on-registering/immigration-permission-stamps/) in your
spouse’s or civil partner’s passport. Your spouse or civil partner then has
permission to live and work in Ireland for the length of time stated on the
stamp.

**If residency permission is not granted**

In some cases, a Stamp 4 may not be given, for example if more information is
needed about identity, criminal history or relationship history. If this
happens, your partner may be asked to make a written application for residency
to ISD. Your partner is not entitled to work in Ireland until they have a
Stamp 4.

##  Step 5: After residency permission is granted

If your spouse or civil partner is given permission to live with you in
Ireland, they will get Stamp 4 in their passport. Stamp 4 allows them to live
and work in Ireland for the length of time stated on the stamp.

Your spouse or civil partner will also be issued with a registration
certificate called an [ Irish Residence Permit (IRP)
](https://www.irishimmigration.ie/registering-your-immigration-
permission/information-on-registering/irish-residence-permit/) . This is a
credit-card sized plastic card that displays basic information about the card
holder.

After permission is granted, your non-EEA spouse or civil partner must inform
ISD of any change of address within 2 days of moving. Also, if their family
circumstances change (for example, if your relationship breaks down) they must
tell ISD.

**Make a note of when the residency permit must be renewed**

Your spouse or civil partner’s [ Stamp 4 permission will usually be valid for
3 years ](http://www.inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/Pages/WP07000024) . In order to stay
in Ireland, your spouse or civil partner will need to [ renew this permission
](https://www.irishimmigration.ie/registering-your-immigration-permission/how-
to-renew-your-current-permission/) before it expires.
