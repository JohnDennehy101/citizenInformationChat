##  Introduction

Cycling is a popular and environmentally friendly way to get around in
Ireland. If you cycle to work, you can get tax relief under the [ Cycle to
Work Scheme ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/travel-and-
recreation/cycling/cycle-to-work-scheme/) to buy a new bike and equipment.

There are separate cycle paths in towns and cities, popular recreational
routes and a growing network of rural greenways.

You can [ find some excellent cycling routes in Ireland

###  **Can I bring a bike on public transport?**

In many cases, you can bring bicycles on public transport in Ireland.

You can bring a bike on any Irish Rail train for free, although there are some
restrictions during busy periods (such as sporting fixtures and concerts).

##  Bike sharing schemes

If you don’t bring a bike on your journey, you can combine public transport
with bike hire at your destination. A bike sharing scheme allows you to use
bikes affordably and take or leave them at various docking stations across a
city.

Ireland has many private bike hire companies with information available
locally. There are 5 major bike share schemes.

###  **Dublin**

Dublin Bikes are available to anyone over the age of 14.

You can hire a Dublin Bike by:

  * Buying either a 1-day ticket, or a 3-day ticket 
  * Taking out an annual subscription. 

See [ dublinbikes.ie ](https://www.dublinbikes.ie/en/home) for details and
pricing.

You can link a [ Transport for Ireland Leap Card
](https://www.leapcard.ie/Home/index.html) to a Dublin Bikes account by
registering at [ Dublinbikes.ie ](http://www.dublinbikes.ie/) .

[ Bleeper ](https://www.bleeperactive.com/) is a stationless bike sharing
scheme available in Dublin. You can unlock a BleeperBike using a smartphone
app. This allows you to pick up a BleeperBike at any public cycle parking area
and return it to any other public cycle parking location within the city.
Users are charged per bike ride. Monthly membership of €17.50 allows for up to
one-hour unlimited bike rides every day. (Fees are charged at the pay-as-you-
go rate after the first hour.)

###  **Cork, Galway and Limerick**

Cork, Galway and Limerick run their own city-wide bike sharing schemes. Bikes
are available for rent at docking stations around the city. An annual
subscription costs €10 with 3-day passes for €3. The first 30 minutes of your
bike ride is free and hourly charges apply afterwards.

See [ bikeshare.ie ](https://www.bikeshare.ie/) for more details on where to
find the bikes and how to sign up for the bike share scheme.

###  **Can I use an electric bike in Ireland?**

##  Greenway trails

Some of Ireland’s greenways were built along the routes of old railways in
Mayo, Waterford, Westmeath, and Limerick.

You can [ find a list of routes on Cycling Ireland
](https://www.cyclingireland.ie/get-involved/find-a-route/) .

###  **Mayo**

Ireland’s first dedicated greenway, the [ Great Western Greenway
](https://www.greenway.ie/great-western-greenway/) opened in 2012 and runs for
44 km, following the route of the Westport to Achill railway line which closed
in 1937.

###  **Waterford**

The [ Waterford Greenway ](https://waterfordgreenway.com/) opened in 2017 and
runs 46 km from Waterford City to Dungarvan.

###  **Limerick**

In Limerick the [ Great Southern Trail ](http://www.southerntrail.net/) runs

The 40km [ Old Rail Trail
](http://www.westmeathcoco.ie/en/ourservices/artsandrecreation/greenways/oldrailtrail-
routemap/) in the midlands, links Athlone to Mullingar. At the Mullingar end,
the Old Rail Trail joins the Royal Canal Greenway, which follows the route of
the Royal Canal out of Dublin north to Clondra in Co Longford.

The [ Royal Canal Greenway ](https://greenwaysireland.org/royal-canal-
greenway/) is Ireland’s longest greenway. Cyclists can start their greenway
cycling in Dublin and bike to the midlands, going north on the Royal Canal
Greenway to Longford or continuing west along the Old Rail Trail to Athlone.
