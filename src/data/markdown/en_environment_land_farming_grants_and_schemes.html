#  Farming grants and schemes

  * Introduction 
  * Pillar 1 – Direct payments and market measures 
  * Pillar 2 – Rural development 
  * Grants for forestry 
  * Grants for buildings and structures 
  * Other grants and schemes 

##  Introduction

If you are a farmer, there are a number of grants and schemes available to
you. For example, there are payments to subsidise your income and grants to
help modernise your farm and make it more sustainable.

Most schemes have their own qualifying criteria and application process.
However, you can apply for some of the schemes when [ applying for BISS
](/en/environment/land/basic-income-support-for-sustainability-scheme-for-
farmers/) , which is the main income subsidy for farmers.

Some of the schemes may be closed to new applicants, but it is important that
you know the terms and conditions of any scheme you are claiming to make sure
you are following the scheme rules.

Most schemes for farmers in Ireland come from the Common Agricultural Policy
(CAP) for all EU countries.

However, there are some separate schemes and grants that are helpful for
farmers, including certain schemes that encourage farmers develop forests.

###  **What is the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP)?**

The Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) is a policy for all EU countries which
includes key objectives for farmers. These include things like:

  * Ensuring a fair income for farmers 
  * Preserving landscapes and biodiversity 
  * Increasing competitiveness in farming 
  * Supporting generational renewal 
  * Protecting food and health quality 
  * Fostering knowledge and innovation 
  * Caring for the environment and meeting climate change goals 

Ireland has a [ CAP Strategic Plan
](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/76026-common-agricultural-policy-cap-
post-2020/) which runs from 2023-2027. This plan explains how CAP works in
Ireland and what schemes are available to farmers.

Under this plan, the schemes are divided into 2 different pillars:

  * Pillar 1: Direct payments and market measures 
  * Pillar 2: Rural development including the Targeted Agriculture Modernisation Schemes 3 (TAMS 3) 

##  Pillar 1 – Direct payments and market measures

Direct payments give farmers financial support to subsidise their farming
income and provide a safety net for them if there are market issues. They
include:

  * [ Basic Income Support for Sustainability (BISS) ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/environment/land/basic-income-support-for-sustainability-scheme-for-farmers/)
  * [ Complementary Income Support for Young Farmers (CIS-YF) ](https://www.gov.ie/en/service/38d46-complementary-income-support-for-young-farmers/)

  * National Reserve: [ Young Farmer category ](https://www.gov.ie/en/service/bb30b-national-reserve-young-farmer-category/) and [ New Farmer category ](https://www.gov.ie/en/service/5b7788-national-reserve-new-entrant-category/)
  * [ Protein Aid Scheme ](https://www.gov.ie/en/service/a6ed7f-protein-aid-scheme/)
  * [ Sectoral Intervention in the Fruit and Vegetables Sector ](https://capnetworkireland.eu/schemes/sectoral-intervention-in-the-fruit-and-vegetables-sector/)

##  Pillar 2 – Rural development

These schemes help support rural development by providing grants for:

  * Modernising and improving farms 
  * Farming sustainably 
  * Protecting the environment 

They include:

**Targeted Agriculture Modernisation Schemes (TAMS 3)**

improve farm buildings and equipment. These come under the Pillar 2 CAP
schemes. TAMS 3 follows on from TAMS 1 and TAMS 2.
