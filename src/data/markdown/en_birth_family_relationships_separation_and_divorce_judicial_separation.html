##  What is judicial separation?

When a couple cannot agree the terms by which they will live separately,
either person can apply to the courts for a 'decree of judicial separation'.
The decree confirms that the couple no longer have to live together as a
married couple. The court may also make orders in relation to custody and
access to children, the payment of maintenance and lump sums, the transfer of
property, the extinguishment of succession rights, etc.

Before the court grants you a decree of judicial separation, it must be
satisfied that:

  * The grounds for the application exist (see Grounds for judicial separation below) 
  * The couple has been advised about counselling and [ mediation ](/en/birth-family-relationships/separation-and-divorce/family-mediation-separating-couples/)
  * Proper provision has been made for the welfare of any _dependants_ (children) 

You can apply for a judicial separation in either in the [ Circuit Court
](/en/justice/courts-system/circuit-court/) or the [ High Court
](/en/justice/courts-system/high-court/) . As in all family law matters, cases
are heard in private (also known as 'in camera) and the public is not allowed
into the courtroom.

A couple must be living apart from one another for at least 1 year before
applying for a judicial separation – see ‘Living apart’ below. This is set out
in the [ Family Law Act 2019 (pdf)
](https://data.oireachtas.ie/ie/oireachtas/act/2019/37/eng/enacted/a3719.pdf)
.

A decree of judicial separation does not give you the right to remarry. To
remarry, you must [ get a divorce ](/en/birth-family-relationships/separation-
and-divorce/divorce-decrees/) .  

##  Grounds for judicial separation

You cannot apply for a judicial separation when you already have a [
separation agreement ](/en/birth-family-relationships/separation-and-
divorce/separation-agreement/) in place which has been made an order of court.

An application for a judicial separation must be based on one of the following
6 grounds:

  * You or your spouse has committed adultery. 
  * One of you has behaved in such a way that it would be unreasonable to expect you both to continue to live together. 
  * One of you has deserted (left) the other for at least one year at the time of the application. 
  * You have lived apart from one another for at least one year at the time of the application for the decree (whether or not both parties agree to the decree being granted) - see ‘Living apart’ below. 
  * The court considers that a normal marital relationship has not existed between you for at least one year before the date of the application (this is the most common ground on which the decree is granted, as neither party has to be shown as being at fault). 

**Living apart**

The [ Family Law Act 2019
](https://data.oireachtas.ie/ie/oireachtas/act/2019/37/eng/enacted/a3719.pdf)
provides a definition of ‘living apart’ to give certainty to the
interpretation of the term in the Irish courts. A married couple who live in
the same home as one another are considered to be ‘living apart’ if they are
not living together as a couple in an intimate and committed relationship. The
Act also states that a relationship does not stop being an intimate
relationship just because the relationship is no longer sexual in nature.

##  How to apply for a judicialseparation

When you are applying for a judicial separation you must submit 4 documents to
the [ Circuit Court ](/en/justice/courts-system/circuit-court/) :

  * An application form (known as a [ family law civil bill ](https://www.courts.ie/acc/alfresco/7cac125a-79bf-4593-8123-8a56044f4439/Form%202N%20-%20Family%20Law%20Civil%20Bill.pdf/doc/1) ). This document describes both you and your spouse, your occupations and where you live. It also sets out when you married, for how long you have been living apart and the names and birth dates of your children. 
  * A sworn statement of means ( [ Form 37A ](https://www.courts.ie/content/affidavit-means-family-law-acts) ). This document sets out your financial situation. This includes your assets, your income, your debts and liabilities, and your outgoings. 
  * A sworn statement relating to the welfare of your children ( [ Form 37B ](https://www.courts.ie/content/affidavit-welfare-family-law-acts) ). This document sets out the personal details of the children of the marriage. It describes where they live and with whom. It also describes their education and training, their health, childcare arrangements and maintenance and access arrangements. 
  * A document certifying that you have been advised of the alternatives to judicial separation ( [ Form 37D ](https://www.courts.ie/content/statutory-declaration-pursuant-section-5-or-section-6-judicial-separation-and-family-law) ). This document is sworn by a solicitor and it certifies that you have discussed the options of reconciliation (getting back together), [ mediation ](/en/birth-family-relationships/separation-and-divorce/family-mediation-separating-couples/) and [ separation agreements ](/en/birth-family-relationships/separation-and-divorce/separation-agreement/) . 

When both you and your spouse have filed all of the necessary documents, you
will be given a date for the court hearing. The hearing will be held in
private. You can read more about the [ factors considered by a court in a
judicial separation case here ](/en/birth-family-relationships/separation-and-
divorce/factors-in-separation-divorce/) .

If all the conditions are met and you have grounds for a judicial separation,
the court will grant you a decree of separation.

[ Further information on applying for a judicial separation
](https://www.courts.ie/judicial-separation) is available on the Courts
Service website.

##  Going to court

Legal advice and representation is always recommended. A solicitor who
specialises in family law can help you by explaining the process and your
options. You and your spouse should not use the same solicitor. Find [ contact
information for solicitors throughout Ireland
](https://www.lawsociety.ie/Find-a-Solicitor) on the Law Society website.

You can:

  * Find out about [ case progression ](https://www.courts.ie/case-progression) (the management of your case before the actual hearing) 
  * Watch a video on [ how to prepare for your family law hearing ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xRlTh-_2-w&t=3s) , and 
  * Watch a video on what happens on [ the day you attend the family court ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9r-MwSXvlo)

The Courts Service also has information on the use of interpreters, [ who and
what to expect in the courtroom ](https://courts.ie/what-expect-courtroom) ,
and [ what happens at the end of a hearing ](https://courts.ie/what-expect-
courtroom) .

##  Getting legal advice

You are not legally required to use a [ solicitor
](/en/justice/courtroom/solicitors/) or a [ barrister
](/en/justice/courtroom/barristers/) . In fact, if you wish, you can choose to
represent yourself. However, there may be complex issues which may make it
very difficult to apply for a judicial separation without any professional
help.

To enquire whether you are [ eligible for Legal Aid ](/en/justice/legal-aid-
and-advice/civil-legal-advice-and-legal-aid/) , you can [ contact your nearest
law centre
](http://www.legalaidboard.ie/lab/publishing.nsf/Content/Law_Centres) . Legal
Aid is not free and everyone must pay a contribution towards costs.

If you choose to hire a private solicitor, you should be aware that there is
no fixed rate of charges for legal fees. You are advised to get some quotes
before deciding on a legal firm. [ Contact information for solicitors firms
throughout Ireland ](https://www.lawsociety.ie/Find-a-Solicitor/Solicitor-
Firm-Search/) is available on the Law Society website.
