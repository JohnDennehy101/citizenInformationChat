](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/social-welfare-
payments/disability-and-illness/disability-benefit/) on the days that you get
SSP. If your first illness in 2024 is less than 5 days and you qualify for
Statutory Sick Pay, you don't need to apply for Illness Benefit. For illnesses
lasting more than 5 days, Illness Benefit starts from day 6. If you use your 5
days of SSP in 2024 and you become ill again in the same year, you'll get
Illness Benefit from day 4 of your illness, which is after the normal 3
waiting days.
