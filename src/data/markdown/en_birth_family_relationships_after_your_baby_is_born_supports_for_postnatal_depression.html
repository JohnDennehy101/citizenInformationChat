#  Supports for postnatal depression

  * Introduction 
  * Supports for postnatal depression 
  * Advice for family and friends 

##  Introduction

Postnatal depression affects 10 to 15% of women within the first year of
giving birth. The symptoms of postnatal depression sometimes start as baby
blues and then get worse. For some women, the symptoms take time to develop
and may be most obvious when your baby is 4 to 6 months old.

[ Symptoms of postnatal depression ](https://www2.hse.ie/conditions/mental-
health/postnatal-depression/postnatal-depression.html) vary from person to
person. You may have mild or severe symptoms. No matter what symptoms you
have, there are supports available to help.

##  Supports for postnatal depression

If you think you are experiencing postnatal depression, it is important to [
ask for help ](https://www2.hse.ie/conditions/mental-health/postnatal-
depression/getting-help.html) . You can [ contact your public health nurse
](https://www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/2/healthcentres/) or [ call your GP
](https://www2.hse.ie/services/find-a-gp/) anytime to discuss how you are
feeling. If you do not feel up to calling your GP, you can ask someone you
trust (such as a partner, friend or family member) to make an appointment for
you.

Other organisations, including charities and parent support groups, are
available too.

Some private health insurance companies include cover for counselling services
under their mother and baby plans. Check with your insurer to see what is
available to you.

##  Advice for family and friends

If you think someone you care about is suffering from postnatal depression, it
is important to [ recognise the symptoms
](https://www2.hse.ie/conditions/mental-health/postnatal-depression/postnatal-
depression.html) and remember that it is treatable.

You will need to provide lots of support, help and encouragement during this
time. As with all illnesses, recovery may be slow and there will be good and
bad days. Try to be patient and understanding.

The HSE has [ advice for partners, friends and families
](https://www2.hse.ie/conditions/mental-health/postnatal-depression/advice-
for-partners-and-families.html) , or you can contact your GP for advice on how
to help. The Nurture Health website also has information on [ how to support
someone with postnatal depression ](https://nurturehealth.ie/pnd-support-
others/) .

###  Mind yourself too

Supporting someone with postnatal depression can be worrying and stressful.
Remember to look after yourself during this time too.

Speak to your friends or family about how you are feeling, and ask them for
help if you need it. Or, you can [ contact your GP
](https://www2.hse.ie/services/find-a-gp/) to chat about any concerns you
have.
