#  Political system at national level

  * Introduction 
  * The Oireachtas (the Irish Parliament) 
  * Legislation 
  * Policy making 

##  Introduction

The [ Constitution ](/en/government-in-ireland/irish-
constitution-1/constitution-introduction/) is the fundamental legal document
that sets down how Ireland should be governed. It establishes the [ President
](/en/government-in-ireland/houses-of-the-oireachtas/president-introduction-
to-the-president-of-ireland/) as the head of State, branches of government,
the courts and it also sets out how those institutions should be run.

The Constitution also describes the [ fundamental rights ](/en/government-in-
ireland/irish-constitution-1/constitution-fundamental-rights/) that every
Irish citizen is entitled to.

##  The Oireachtas (the Irish Parliament)

The [ Dáil ](/en/government-in-ireland/houses-of-the-oireachtas/dail-eireann/)
and [ Seanad ](/en/government-in-ireland/houses-of-the-oireachtas/the-seanad/)
(Senate) are collectively known as the Houses of the Oireachtas. The [
Government ](/en/government-in-ireland/how-government-works/national-
government/government-of-ireland/) is chosen by and is collectively
responsible to the Dáil. There must be a minimum of 7 and a maximum of 15
Ministers. The Taoiseach, the Tanaiste and the Minister for Finance must be
members of the Dáil. It is possible to have 2 Ministers who are members of the
Senate but this rarely happens.

The Government's main functions are to propose legislation, manage the public
finances and [ administer the government departments ](/en/government-in-
ireland/how-government-works/national-government/departments-of-state/) .

The Government is responsible to the Dáil. It is not responsible to the
Senate. However, Ministers have a right to attend the Senate and it is normal
practice for the relevant Minister or Minister of State to be present when the
House is dealing with their areas of responsibility.

###  Committees

Much of the work of the Dáil and Senate is done in Committees. Each House may
form Committees for particular purposes. Select Committees have the power to
take oral and written evidence and seek documents. Joint Committees are Select
Committees of each House sitting and voting together. Special Committees do
not have the same powers as Select Committees.

Committees deal with Estimates of Expenditure, Committee Stages of Bills
relevant to their terms of reference and related reports. It is common for
Committees to invite voluntary and community organisations and/ or experts to
make submissions to them on various issues and it is also common for such
organisations to ask to make a submission.

###  Controlling the public finances

Each year, the Government prepares the _Estimates of the Receipts and
Expenditure of the State_ . This is an outline of the costs of running each
Department and Office of State. The Estimates are published before the annual
Budget. The Dáil and the relevant Committees debate the Estimates in detail.
The Estimates are passed by the Dáil and are given statutory effect by the
_Appropriation Act_ . The Budget is given immediate legal effect by financial
resolutions of the Dáil on the evening of the Budget speech. The Finance Act
must be passed within 4 months of the Budget.

Budgeting is on an annual basis. You can [ view the full text of Ireland's
Budget here ](http://www.budget.gov.ie/) .

The [ Comptroller and Auditor General ](/en/government-in-ireland/how-
government-works/standards-and-accountability/comptroller-and-auditor-
general/) is appointed under [ the Constitution ](/en/government-in-
ireland/irish-constitution-1/constitution-introduction/) to control on behalf
of the State all disbursements and to audit all accounts of moneys
administered by or under the authority of the Oireachtas. The Comptroller's
functions are set out in legislation.

##  Legislation

It is almost always the Government of the day that propose new laws. A
Minister presents a _Bill_ to the Dáil or Seanad for discussion and decision.
A _Bill_ is proposed [ legislation ](/en/government-in-ireland/houses-of-the-
oireachtas/legislation/) \- after it is passed and signed by the President, it
is called an _Act._ Sometimes, a TD or Senator presents a [ Private Member's
Bill ](/en/government-in-ireland/houses-of-the-oireachtas/private-members-
bills/) . It is very rare for such a Bill to get beyond the first stage - the
reasons for this are political rather than legal. However, some important
legislation in recent years has resulted from Private Members' Bills - notably
The Judicial Separation and Family Law Reform Act 1989. The procedure is the
same whether the Bill is proposed by the Government or by a Member.

Usually, a Bill is presented by a Minister to the Dáil. Occasionally the
process is started in the Seanad but any Bills dealing with taxation or
related matters must start in the Dáil. Each Bill has to go through a number
of _stages_ or _readings_ . It can be defeated at any of these stages and, if
this happens in the Dáil, the process ends there. The Seanad can only obstruct
a Bill. In practice, Government Bills are not often defeated. You can view [
all Irish legislation 1922 to date here ](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/) .

###  Secondary legislation

Subordinate legislation is a lesser form of legislation than Acts. The most
common is a Statutory Instrument (SI). There must be specific power laid down
in an Act in order to allow a Statutory Instrument to be effective. Usually an
Act authorises a Minister to make Regulations dealing with details. The Act
itself sets out the general law. The Statutory Instrument cannot deviate in
any way from what is laid down in the Act - if they do, they are what is
called _ultra vires_ . That means "beyond the powers" - that is, the Minister
does not have the power to do what he is purporting to do.

Statutory Instruments do not usually have to be passed by the Oireachtas.

###  The role of Ministers

Under the Constitution, [ Departments of State ](/en/government-in-
ireland/how-government-works/national-government/departments-of-state/) are
administered by members of the Government (Ministers) and the Minister is in
charge of the Department. This means that final responsibility rests with the
Minister but many of the functions of the Department and responsibility for
various actions are assigned to [ civil servants ](/en/government-in-
ireland/how-government-works/national-government/the-civil-service/) .

##  Policy making

###  Green Papers, White Papers and discussion documents

A Green Paper is a discussion document, usually written by civil servants, in
which an issue is outlined, various options are suggested and the advantages
and disadvantages of those options may be set out. Generally, the public is
asked for submissions on the options proposed. After this process is complete,
a White Paper is drawn up - this sets out the Government's policy on the issue
and what it intends to do. The proposals in the White Paper are then
implemented.

Sometimes this process occurs but the titles Green and White Papers are not
used; they are called discussion documents or something similar. Sometimes a
White Paper is published without a preceding Green Paper. Sometimes the
process is carried through and then nothing happens after the White Paper is
published. Sometimes papers are published which have the same effect as a
White Paper but are called strategy documents or similar. The actual public
consultation process varies as well.
