##  Introduction

The new National Home Energy Upgrade Scheme provides grants to upgrade the
energy efficiency of your home. When the work is completed your home should
have an energy efficiency rating of B2 or above.

The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) administers the grants and
a private company manages the work for you. These companies are called [ One
Stop Shops ](https://www.seai.ie/grants/home-energy-grants/one-stop-shop/) ,
and the scheme is also known as the One Stop Shop Service.

The SEAI also provides [ individual energy upgrade grants
](/ga/housing/housing-grants-and-schemes/grants-for-home-renovations-and-
improvements/better-energy-homes-scheme/) , if you only want to do certain
home energy upgrades, and would prefer to manage the process yourself. There
is also a [ free home energy upgrade scheme ](/ga/housing/housing-grants-and-
schemes/grants-for-home-renovations-and-improvements/warmer-homes-scheme/) for
people on low incomes.

##  How the process works?

You need to use a private company registered with the SEAI to access this
grant (also known as [ One Stop Shops ](https://www.seai.ie/grants/home-
energy-grants/one-stop-shop/) ). They will manage the whole project for you,
bringing your home up to a BER rating of B2 or above.

The company will:

  * Complete an initial energy assessment of your home and advise you on the upgrades you need to bring it up to a B2 BER rating or higher 
  * Apply and accept the SEAI grants for your home 
  * Assign a contractor to do the work on your home 
  * Manage the works at your home ensuring that everything is up to standard 
  * Complete the final BER assessment when the work is done 

These companies deduct the grants from the cost of the works in advance, so
you only pay what is outstanding. Some of these operators also provide finance
options, so you have different ways to pay for the outstanding cost of the
works.

##  Do I qualify for the grants?

To qualify for a grant you must:

  * Be the owner of a property built and occupied before 2011 for insulation, heating control systems and renewable systems grants 
  * Have a home with a BER of B3 or lower before the work 
  * Reach a BER of at least B2 after the work and have a BER improvement of 100kWh/m2 per year 
  * Not have already used grants for the same energy upgrades 
  * Use an SEAI registered company ( [ One Stop Shop ](https://www.seai.ie/grants/home-energy-grants/one-stop-shop/) ) to manage the process, work and applications 

##  What energy upgrade grants can I get under the scheme?

Under this scheme, you can get grants for:

  * Attic insulation 
  * Rafter insulation 
  * Wall insulation - including cavity wall, internal dry lining and external insulation 
  * Floor insulation 
  * Heating controls 
  * Solar thermal solutions (solar hot water) 
  * Solar PV panels 
  * Heat pump systems and central heating system for heat pump 
  * New windows 
  * New external doors 
  * Mechanical ventilation 
  * Air tightness 
  * Home energy assessment 
  * Project management 

##  How much are the grants?

The table below shows the grant amount available for each energy upgrade. The
amount you get for each upgrade can depend on the type of home you have. For
example, the grant you get to insulate a detached house is more than the grant
you get to insulate an apartment.

The One-Stop-Shop will assess your home and recommend the work needed to get
your home up to a BER B2 rating.
