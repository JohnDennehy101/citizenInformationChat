  * How your income is assessed for Farm Assist 
  * Rates 
  * How to apply for Farm Assist 

##  What is Farm Assist?

Farm Assist (FA) is a means-tested payment for low-income farmers.

There is a similar social welfare payment for fishermen and women called [
Fish Assist ](https://www.gov.ie/en/service/bbdf0f-fish-assist/) .

##  How to qualify for Farm Assist

To qualify for Farm Assist, you must:

  * Be a farmer 
  * Be farming land in Ireland 
  * Be aged between 18 and 66 
  * Pass a means test – see ‘how your income is assessed for Farm Assist’ below. 

You are considered a farmer, if you farm land that you own or lease and that
you use for the purpose of _husbandry_ . Husbandry means working the land with
the aim of taking produce from the land.

##  How your income is assessed for Farm Assist

In a means test the Department of Social Protection examines all your sources
of income. To get FA, your income must be below a certain amount.

The some of the items included in the means test are:

  * **Cash income** that you or your spouse, civil partner or cohabitant may have. There is [ some cash income not included in the means test ](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/means-test-for-social-welfare-payments/cash-income-not-included-in-the-social-welfare-means-test/) . 
  * **Capital** , for example, the value of savings, investments, shares or any property you have (but not your own home). The first €20,000 of your capital is not taken into account. Find out more about [ capital not included in the means test ](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/means-test-for-social-welfare-payments/how-to-assess-your-means-from-capital-for-social-welfare-payments/) . 
  * **Maintenance** paid to you. More information is available in our document about [ how maintenance is assessed as means ](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/means-test-for-social-welfare-payments/maintenance-and-social-welfare-payments/) . 

On the page we look at how income from farming and certain schemes such as the
Rural Environmental Protection Scheme (REPS) and employment is assessed.

You can find detailed information on how all sources of income are assessed in
the [ means test for Farm Assist
](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/3c0a96-operational-guidelines-farm-
assist/#introduction) on gov.ie.

###  Farm income and other income from self-employment

Farm income and other income from off-farm self-employment is assessed at 70%
(down from 100% since March 2017), with additional annual disregards of €254
for each of the first two children and €381 for the third and other children.
(The disregards for dependent children are applied first and 70% of the
balance is assessed.)

Your income from farming is assessed as gross income that you, your spouse,
civil partner or cohabitant may be expected to receive minus any expenses you
incur to earn that income. Your income from the previous 12 months is used to
assess your likely future earnings. However, it is not simply assumed that
your previous year’s earnings will be repeated the following year as farmers
can have significant variations in income from year to year.

When you apply for Farm Assist, a social welfare inspector will call to see
you and ask to see various documents. For example, accounts prepared for tax
purposes, creamery returns, cattle registration cards, details of headage
payments and area aid. They will also want information on the sale of crops,
cattle, milk and other produce. The inspector will then assess the costs
actually and necessarily incurred in connection with the running of the farm.
These costs may include rent, annuities, the cost of inputs like feed and
fertiliser and the depreciation of farm machinery. Labour costs are taken into
account, with the exception of the labour of the farmer and their spouse,
civil partner or cohabitant. You are entitled to receive a copy of this farm
income calculation.

If you or your spouse, cohabitant or civil partner has other income from self-
employment, this is also assessed, taking into account the costs incurred in
the business. The income from farming and other forms of self-employment is
added together and the costs involved are deducted.

You may be liable to pay [ Class S contributions ](/en/social-welfare/irish-
social-welfare-system/social-insurance-prsi/class-s-prsi/) on your income from
self-employment.

###  Income from farm schemes and direct payments

Payments from certain farm schemes, for example, the Rural Environmental
Protection Scheme (REPS), the Agri-Environmental Options Scheme (AEOS), the
Special Area of Conservation (SAC) or the [ Green Low-Carbon Agri-Environment
Scheme (GLAS) ](http://www.agriculture.gov.ie/farmerschemespayments/glas/) are
treated as follows:

  * The first €5,000 per year of payments is disregarded then 
  * 50% of the balance is also disregarded 
  * Expenses incurred in complying with these measures are deducted 

And

  * The balance is assessed as means. 

You can find a [ full list of farm schemes that qualify for the disregard on
gov.ie ](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/3c0a96-operational-guidelines-farm-
assist/#direct-payment-scheme) .

Under the Direct Payment system, a farmer’s payment can be a combination of
payments under 4 separate schemes. These are the Basic Payment Scheme (BPS),
the Greening Payment, the Young Farmer’s Scheme (YFS) and Aid for Protein
Crops. Direct payments do not get the above disregards.

###  Income from leasing of land

If you have leased part of your land, the income from the leasing is assessed
in full. It is not included in the assessment of income from farming as
described above. If you have leased all your land, you are not eligible for
Farm Assist.

###  Income from employment

Your income from a job is assessed. Your assessable weekly earnings (gross
income less PRSI, union dues and superannuation fees) are usually assessed on
the basis of the 13 weeks before you claim. Not all of your income is taken
into account. €20 per day (up to a maximum of €60) is deducted from your
assessable weekly earnings and then 60% of the balance is assessed as weekly
means.

Any income from an occupational pension is assessed in full. If you have
seasonal work, you are assessed on your earnings only during the period you
are actually working.

Your spouse, civil partner or cohabitant's income from employment is assessed
in the same way (€20 per day with a maximum of €60 is deducted and 60% of the
balance is assessed as weekly means).

People who were getting Farm Assist before 26 September 2007 and who were
still in payment on 26 September 2007 may be assessed differently.

##  Rates

**Weekly** **Farm Assist rates 2024**

**Maximum weekly personal rate** |  **Increase for an adult dependant** |  **Increase for a child dependant**

welfare-payment-for-an-adult-dependant/) . If you do not qualify for an
