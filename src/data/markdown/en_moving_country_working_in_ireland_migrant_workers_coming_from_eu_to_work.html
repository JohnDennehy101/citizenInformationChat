#  Coming from the EU/EEA to work

  * Introduction 
  * Residence rights for you and your family 
  * Your right to be treated equally 
  * Looking for work 
  * Social security and tax 
  * Employment rights 

##  Introduction

As an EU citizen you can come to Ireland to look for work, and you can take up
employment or self-employment without needing an employment permit. This also
applies to citizens of European Economic Area (EEA) and Switzerland.

The [ EEA ](/en/government-in-ireland/european-government/european-
union/european-union/) is made up of the member states of the EU, plus Norway,
Iceland and Liechtenstein.

UK citizens can live and work in Ireland as part of the [ Common Travel Area
](/en/government-in-ireland/ireland-and-the-uk/common-travel-area-between-
ireland-and-the-uk/) .

##  Residence rights for you and your family

EU, EEA and Swiss citizens can [ travel to Ireland ](/en/government-in-
ireland/european-government/european-union/freedom-of-movement-in-the-eu/)
without a visa. You must have a passport or national identity card to enter
Ireland. Ireland is not part of [ the Schengen Area ](/en/government-in-
ireland/european-government/european-union/schengen-area/) .

You can stay in Ireland for up to 6 months to look for work. You do not have
to register with Immigration Service Delivery (the Irish immigration
authorities). If you have not found work after 6 months, you can stay in
Ireland if you are able to support yourself. You are not entitled to social
welfare assistance while you are looking for a job.

However, if you were getting an unemployment payment in another EU/EEA
country, you may continue to get this paid. You should ask for a form U2 from
the country that pays you before you come to Ireland.

You can [ remain in Ireland ](/en/moving-country/moving-to-ireland/rights-of-
residence-in-ireland/residence-rights-eu-national/) for over 6 months if:

  * You are employed or self-employed 
  * You have enough resources to support yourself and your dependents 
  * You are a student, have enough resources to support yourself, and you have comprehensive health insurance 

###  Your family

Your EU, EEA, UK or Swiss citizen family members can reside with you in
Ireland.

If you have [ family members ](/en/moving-country/moving-to-ireland/rights-of-
residence-in-ireland/residence-rights-eu-national/) that are from outside the
EU, EEA, UK or Switzerland, they must [ apply for residence
](https://www.irishimmigration.ie/coming-to-join-family-in-ireland/joining-an-
eea-or-swiss-national/eu-treaty-rights/) . If they are from a country whose
citizens need a [ visa to enter Ireland ](/en/moving-country/visas-for-
ireland/visa-requirements-for-entering-ireland/) , they must apply for a visa
before travelling to Ireland. If the family member has a residence card issued
by another EEA country under EU law, they can enter Ireland without a visa.

###  Returning to Ireland

Our ‘ [ Returning to Ireland ](/en/returning-to-ireland/overview-of-returning-
to-ireland/) ’ section has information on rights and entitlements for
returning Irish citizens.

##  Your right to be treated equally

You have the right to be treated equally to Irish citizens and you should not
be discriminated against because you are not an Irish citizen. This means, you
should have the same rights as an Irish worker regarding:

  * [ Working rights ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/employment/employment_rights_and_conditions/) and conditions 
  * [ How you are taxed ](/en/money-and-tax/tax/income-tax/how-your-tax-is-calculated/)
  * Social insurance contributions ( [ PRSI ](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/social-insurance-prsi/paying-social-insurance/) ) 
  * Access to training 
  * Membership of [ trade unions ](/en/employment/employment-rights-and-conditions/industrial-relations-and-trade-unions/trade-unions/)
  * Access to [ education ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/education/) (including schools for your children) 
  * [ Access to healthcare ](/en/health/health-system/entitlement-to-public-health-services/)

##  Looking for work

You can find work in a number of ways:

  * Online at websites like [ JobsIreland ](https://jobsireland.ie/) . There are also lots of [ private recruitment agencies ](https://nrf.ie/how-to-join/agency-directory/) online 
  * On social media 
  * On company websites 

You can read more about [ looking for work in Ireland
](/en/employment/starting-work-and-changing-job/training-and-looking-for-
work/finding-and-getting-a-job/) .

You may have to [ get your professional qualifications recognised
](/en/returning-to-ireland/starting-work/Recognition-of-professional-
qualifications-in-ireland/) in Ireland.

##  Social security and tax

When you are offered a job, or if you want to start your own business, you
will need to get a [ Public Personal Services Number ](/en/social-
welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/personal-public-service-number/) (PPS
number). You also must register with Revenue. Find out more about [ starting
work in Ireland ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/employment/starting-
work-and-changing-job/starting-work/tax-and-starting-work/) .

As an employee, your employer will make deductions from your pay for tax and
social insurance. The [ amount you pay ](/en/money-and-tax/tax/income-tax/how-
your-tax-is-calculated/) depends on your salary and your circumstances (for
example, if you are married). Your employer must give you a [ payslip
](/en/employment/employment-rights-and-conditions/pay-and-employment/pay-
slip/) , which will set out these deductions:

  * PAYE: _Pay As You Earn_ – this is income tax 
  * USC: _Universal Social Charge_ – this is another tax 
  * PRSI: _Pay Related Social Insurance_ – this is social insurance 

PRSI contributes to your pension, and if you become unemployed or ill, you may
be able to claim a social welfare payment based on your PRSI contributions.
You can [ combine social insurance contributions ](/en/social-welfare/irish-
social-welfare-system/claiming-a-social-welfare-payment/social-insurance-
contributions-from-abroad/) that you made in another EEA country to qualify
for Irish benefits.

If you are self-employed, you must [ pay your own taxes ](/en/money-and-
tax/tax/income-tax/taxation-of-self-employed-people/) and social insurance by
making an annual tax return.

###  Family benefits

While you are employed or self-employed in Ireland you can claim family
benefits for your dependent children. This includes children that continue to
live in another EU/EEA country.

You can continue to get these payments for a period if you lose your job or
cannot work due to sickness or incapacity.

country/working-in-ireland/migrant-workers/migrant-workers-and-unemployment/)

  * [ Minimum wage ](/en/employment/employment-rights-and-conditions/pay-and-employment/minimum-wage/)
  * [ Rest periods and breaks ](/en/employment/employment-rights-and-conditions/hours-of-work/work-breaks-and-rest-periods/)
