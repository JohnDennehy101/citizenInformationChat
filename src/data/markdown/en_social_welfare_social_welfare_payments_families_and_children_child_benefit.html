##  What is Child Benefit?

Child Benefit is a monthly payment to the parents or guardians of children
under 16.

You can also get Child Benefit for children aged 16, 17 and 18 if they:

  * Are in full-time education or full-time training, or 
  * Have a disability and cannot support themselves. 

Full-time education includes:

  * Primary and post-primary level 
  * Further education and training courses 
  * Third-level colleges and institutions (there are some exceptions – see ‘What counts as full-time education?’ below). 

You don’t pay tax on Child Benefit.

##  Can I get Child Benefit?

The Department of Social Protection pays Child Benefit to the child’s mother
or stepmother. However, if you are the child’s father or stepfather, you can
get the payment if the child does not live with their mother or step-mother.

If you are caring for a child who is not living with their parents (or not
being maintained by their parents), you may get Child Benefit.

If your child lives between 2 separate households (for example, if the parents
are separated), the DSP pays Child Benefit to the parent who lives with the
child most of the time. If the child lives an equal amount of time with each
parent, the mother gets Child Benefit.

###  **Rules to get Child Benefit**

To get Child Benefit, you must be living in Ireland and meet the [ Habitual
Residence Condition (HRC) ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-
welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/social-assistance-payments/habitual-
residence-condition/) .

Your child must be under 16, or:

  * Aged 16, 17 or 18 and in full-time education or training 
  * Aged 16, 17 or 18, have a disability, and be unable to support themselves. 

You cannot claim Child Benefit for a child in [ a detention facility
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/justice/children-and-young-
offenders/detention-of-children/) .

###  **What counts as full-time education?**

Full-time education includes primary and post-primary schools, further
education and training courses, and third-level courses.

However, full-time education does not include courses:

  * That are part of an employment, apprenticeship, or work experience programme 
  * Which arise from employment 
  * Where the period of paid work experience is more than the time spent in the classroom 
  * Run by Teagasc where, in an academic year, the period of work experience is more than the time spent in the classroom 

##  Non-Irish citizens and Child Benefit

###  **Working or living in the UK**

The rules for getting Child Benefit continue as they did before [ the UK left
the EU (Brexit) ](/en/government-in-ireland/ireland-and-the-uk/what-is-
brexit/) .

This means:

  * If you work in the UK and live in Ireland, you can continue getting your UK Child Benefit and a top-up of Irish Child Benefit. 
  * If you work in Ireland and live in the UK, you can continue getting your Irish Child Benefit. 
  * If you work and live in Ireland with your children, and your partner (spouse, civil partner, or cohabitant) works in the UK, you should apply for Child Benefit in Ireland. 

###  **EU and EEA citizens**

If you are an [ EU or EEA citizen
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/government-in-ireland/european-
government/european-union/european-union/) working in Ireland (employed or
self-employed), you automatically meet the [ habitual residence condition
(HRC) ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/irish-social-
welfare-system/social-assistance-payments/habitual-residence-condition/) .

You also meet the HRC if you have been working in Ireland but become
unemployed and get [ Jobseeker’s Benefit
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/unemployed-
people/jobseekers-benefit/) .

If your child is living in a different EU or EEA country from you, you should
also apply for any family benefit payments you are entitled to in the country
where they live.

###  **Non-EU and non-EEA citizens**

If you are not an EU or EEA citizen, you must meet the [ habitual residence
condition (HRC) ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/irish-
social-welfare-system/social-assistance-payments/habitual-residence-
condition/) to quality for Child Benefit in Ireland. Your child must be living
in Ireland, but they do not have to be an Irish citizen.

If you are not an EU or EEA citizen and are legally working in Ireland, you
**may** qualify for Child Benefit if your child is resident in Ireland or in
another EU state.

##  How much is Child Benefit?

Child Benefit is €140 a month for each child. It is a ‘universal’ payment.
This means you can get it regardless of your income and social insurance
(PRSI) record.

**Monthly** **Child Benefit rate 2024**

**Family size** |  **Monthly rate of Child Benefit**  
---|---  
1 child  |  €140   
2 children  |  €280   
3 children  |  €420   
4 children  |  €560   
5 children  |  €700   
6 children  |  €840   
7 children  |  €980   
8 children  |  €1,120   
  
###  **Twins or triplets**

If you have twins, you get one-and-a-half times the normal monthly rate of
Child Benefit for each child.

For triplets and other multiple births, Child Benefit is paid at double the
normal monthly rate for each child.

###  **I don’t want to get Child Benefit**

You don’t have to claim Child Benefit. If you decide not to claim it for a new
baby, or decide to stop getting it for your children, you can contact the
Child Benefit Section. See ‘Contact details’ below.

##  When will I be paid Child Benefit?

You will be paid Child Benefit on the first Tuesday of every month.

If you have never received Child Benefit before and then you have a baby,
you’ll get your first payment at the start of the month after your child is
born.

###  **If your child is aged 16-18 and in full-time education**

If your child is 16, 17 or 18 and in full-time education, you will get Child
Benefit until June in each academic year.

In August, the Child Benefit section will send you an application form. You
must complete it when your child returns to full-time education in September.

Once your child returns to education in September, you will get a back-payment
of Child Benefit for July and August.

If your child turns 19 in July or August and returns to full-time education in
September, you will get a back-payment of Child Benefit up until the month
they turn 19.

If you don’t get a form in the post from the Child Benefit section, you can
download and complete [ Child Benefit form CB2 (pdf)
](https://assets.gov.ie/27240/b0ecba21ca62497581edabcc313955b2.pdf) in
September. See ‘How to apply for Child Benefit’ below.

##  When to apply for Child Benefit

Depending on your situation, you should apply for Child Benefit within 12
months of:

  * Your baby being born 
  * The child becoming a member of your family 
  * Your family coming to live in Ireland 
  * You starting work in Ireland (if your children are living in another EU country) 

##  How to apply for Child Benefit

###  **Applying for Child Benefit when your baby is born**

If your baby is born in Ireland, you must [ register their birth
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/birth-family-relationships/after-your-
baby-is-born/registering-birth-your-baby/) within 3 months. After you do this,
the Department of Social Protection (DSP) will:

  * Give a [ Personal Public Service (PPS) number ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/personal-public-service-number/) to your baby, and 
  * Start a Child Benefit claim for your child (see more below). 

####  **If claiming for your first child**

If you’re not claiming Child Benefit for any other children and you [ register
the birth of your baby ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/birth-family-
relationships/after-your-baby-is-born/registering-birth-your-baby/) within 3
months, the Child Benefit Section of the DSP will send you a partly completed
[ Child Benefit form CB1 (pdf)
](https://assets.gov.ie/27239/42f7099b15a3431b9ef0a46e23948ae9.pdf) .

The form will include information on how you can claim for your new baby
online. You can claim online only if you are invited to do so by the DSP.

####  **If already claiming for other children**

If you are already claiming Child Benefit for another child and you register
the birth of your new baby within 3 months, your new baby will be added to
your Child Benefit claim.

The DSP will write to you confirming when payment will start.

####  **Child born abroad, or not registered within 3 months**

If your child was not born in Ireland, or if you did not register their birth
within 3 months, you must complete [ Child Benefit form CB1 (pdf)
](https://assets.gov.ie/27239/42f7099b15a3431b9ef0a46e23948ae9.pdf) and send
it to the Child Benefit Section. See contact details under ‘More information’
below.

###  **Applying for Child Benefit for a child aged 16, 17 or 18**

You can continue getting Child Benefit for a child aged 16, 17 or 18 if they:

  * Have a disability, or 
  * Are in full-time education or full-time training. 

You must complete [ Child Benefit form CB2 (pdf)
](https://assets.gov.ie/27240/b0ecba21ca62497581edabcc313955b2.pdf) one month
before your child’s 16th birthday. The form must also be signed and officially
stamped by either:

  * The school or college, if your child is in full-time education 
  * The training organisation, if your child is in full-time training 
  * A doctor, if your child has a disability and cannot financially support themselves. 

####  **If you already get Child Benefit for this child**

The DSP will send you a partly completed application form. You must confirm
that your child is still in full-time education or full-time training, or has
a disability and cannot support themselves.

####  **If it’s your first time claiming Child Benefit for this child**

You should complete both application forms:

  * [ Child Benefit form CB1 (pdf) ](https://assets.gov.ie/27239/42f7099b15a3431b9ef0a46e23948ae9.pdf)
  * [ Child Benefit form CB2 (pdf) ](https://assets.gov.ie/27240/b0ecba21ca62497581edabcc313955b2.pdf)

###  **Change in circumstances**

You must tell the Department of Social Protection (DSP) in writing about any
changes in your circumstances which could affect your Child Benefit claim.

For example, you should tell the DSP if:

  * You change your address 
  * Your child no longer lives with you (or is not in your care) 
  * You start using a different bank or post office for your benefit payments 
  * Your child who is aged 16, 17 or 18 leaves full-time education 
  * You or your children leave Ireland (move abroad) 
  * You or your partner start work in another country 

Use [ Form CB56 ](https://www.gov.ie/en/form/69c3e8-child-benefit-change-of-
events-cb56/) to tell the DSP of any changes to your circumstances.

###  **Fraudulent claims**

If you make false or misleading statements to try to get Child Benefit for
yourself, or for any other person, you may be prosecuted. This could result in
a fine or a prison term, or both.
