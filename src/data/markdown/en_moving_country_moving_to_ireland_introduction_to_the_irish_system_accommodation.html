#  Housing

  * Introduction 
  * How to apply 
  * Where to apply 

##  Introduction

You should arrange accommodation before you arrive in Ireland. Organise in
advance to stay with friends or book yourself in to a hotel or a hostel in
order to give yourself time to look around and get to grips with the
accommodation situation in the area in which you plan to live.

###  Buying a house

If you are thinking of [ buying a house
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/housing/owning_a_home/buying_a_home/)
, you need to be aware of the price trends in this country, the process by
which houses are bought and sold and the initial [ costs ](/en/housing/owning-
a-home/buying-a-home/costs-of-buying-a-home/) that are involved.

###  Renting accommodation

[ Rented accommodation
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/housing/renting_a_home/) comes in many
forms. You can choose from houses, flats, apartments, house-shares and bed-
sits, according to what suits your needs and your budget. You will need to
know where and how rental properties are advertised, such as accommodation
websites, accommodation sections of newspapers and advertisements in shops and
colleges. It is also important to understand the rental process and what your
[ rights and responsibilities are as a tenant ](/en/housing/renting-a-
home/tenants-rights-and-responsibilities/tenants-rights-and-obligations/) .

###  Social housing

Local authorities are the main providers of [ social housing
](/en/housing/local-authority-and-social-housing/applying-for-local-authority-
housing/) for people who cannot afford to buy their own homes. Non-Irish
nationals must have a [ legal right to remain in the State ](/en/moving-
country/moving-to-ireland/rights-of-residence-in-ireland/residence-rights-eu-
national/) on a long-term basis to be eligible to apply for social housing.
Detailed rules are contained in [ Circular Housing 41/2012 Access to social
housing supports for non-Irish nationals (pdf).
](https://www.housing.old.gov.ie/sites/default/files/migrated-
files/en/Publications/DevelopmentandHousing/Housing/FileDownLoad,29412,en.pdf)
