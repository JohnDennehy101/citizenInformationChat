#  Local elections in Ireland

  * Introduction 
  * Can I vote in a local election? 
  * Standing for election 
  * Rules for candidates 

##  Introduction

Local elections allow people to elect councillors to represent them in their [
local authorities ](/en/government-in-ireland/how-government-works/local-and-
regional-government/functions-of-local-authorities/) . The elections are held
every 5 years, in the month of May or June. The last local election was on 7
June 2024.

There are 31 local authorities in Ireland, including County Councils, City
Councils, and City and County Councils. Each county, city, and city and county
council is divided into [ local electoral areas
](https://boundarycommittee.ie/) . Each local electoral area has a certain
number of councillors to elect.

The polling date is set by the Minister for Housing, Local Government and
Heritage. The polling period must last at least 12 hours between 7am and
10.30pm and be held on the same day in all of the local authority areas.

##  Can I vote in a local election?

You do not have to be an Irish citizen to vote in a local election. However,
you must be ordinarily resident in Ireland to vote. You may not vote in both a
county council and a city council election.

To vote in a local election, you must:

  * Be over 18 years of age 
  * Live in the local electoral area 
  * Be on the electoral register 

To find out if your name is on the electoral register, you can [
checktheregister.ie ](https://www.checktheregister.ie/en-IE/) .

You can read more about [ registering to vote
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/government-in-ireland/elections-and-
referenda/voting/registering-to-vote/) .

ireland/elections-and-referenda/voting/voting-in-a-local-election/) .

##  Standing for election

If you wish to stand for election to a local authority in Ireland, you must be
nominated.

You may nominate yourself or be nominated by a person who is registered to
vote in the local authority area.

You may be nominated to stand in more than one local authority area. However,
if you are elected to more than one local authority area, you must declare in
writing which area you want to represent within 3 days of the public notice of
the results of the election.

###  Nomination process

If you wish to stand for election to a local authority in Ireland, you must be
nominated during the week that takes place 4 weeks before the polling day. You
can check when nominations will be accepted by the [ local authority
](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/942f74-local-authorities/) .

[ Nomination forms (pdf) ](https://www.sdcc.ie/en/download-it/apply-for-
it/form-le1.pdf) (LE1) are available from the local authority returning
officer. When you have completed your nomination form, return the form to the
returning officer within the date set for receiving nominations by the [ local
authority ](https://www.gov.ie/en/organisation-information/fd139-local-
government-councils-and-
councillors/?referrer=https://www.housing.gov.ie/local-
government/administration/local-authorities/local-authorities) .

If you are affiliated with a political party, you must submit a Certificate of
Party Affiliation with your nomination form.

Both independent and party affiliated candidates can include a photograph to
be included on the ballot paper. You can find the photo size and other
requirements detailed in the [ nomination form (pdf)
](https://monaghan.ie/planning/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2019/04/Nomination-
form-English.pdf) .

The returning officer must rule on whether your nomination paper is valid
within one hour of when you submit it.

###  Non-party or independent candidates

If you have no party affiliation, you may describe your nomination as 'Non-
Party' or leave the question blank on the nomination form.

If you are an independent candidate, you must submit your nomination form,
along with one of the following, to the returning officer:

  * The completion of [ statutory declarations by 15 assenters (pdf) ](https://www.waterfordcouncil.ie/elections/forms/LE1A-Statutory%20Declaration%20English.pdf) (people that support your nomination), or 
  * Lodge a deposit of €100 with the returning officer 

Assenters must be people who are registered to vote in the local electoral
area.

The statutory declaration must be witnessed by one of the following:

  * [ Commissioner for oaths ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/justice/civil-law/commissioners-for-oaths/)
  * A [ peace commissioner ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/justice/civil-law/peace-commissioners/)
  * A [ notary public ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/justice/civil-law/notaries-public/)
  * A member of the [ Garda Síochána ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/justice/law-enforcement/garda-siochana-national-police-force/)
  * An official of the registration authority 

##  Rules for candidates

###  Candidate spending limit

election campaign. This amount varies depending on the population size of the
local electorate area.

**Local electoral area** |  **Candidate spending limit**  
---|---  
Population over 35,000  |  €15,350   
Population between 18,001 and 35,000  |  €13,600   
Population of 18,000 or less  |  €11,500   
  
Candidates must disclose how much they spent to the local authority within 90
days after polling day. The Minister sets the start date of the campaign
spending period, which must be between 50 and 60 days before polling day.

###  Donations

The following rules apply to candidates:

  * A candidate may accept no more than €1,000 from a specific donor in a calendar year 
  * Details of donations over €600 must be given to the local authority 
  * A candidate who receives a donation over €100 must open and maintain a bank account specifically for their political donations

  * For corporate donations over €200 the donor must be registered with the [ Standards in Public Office Commission ](https://www.sipo.ie/en/) and evidence that the donation was approved by the corporate body must be provided 

###  Local election posters and signs

The [ Litter Pollution Act 1997
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1997/act/12/enacted/en/html) , as amended
by the [ Electoral (Amendment) (No. 2) Act 2009
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2009/act/9/enacted/en/html) allows people
to display election posters for a certain period. They can be displayed from
the date the Minister appoints the polling day by order, or 30 days before
polling day, whichever is shorter. They must be taken down within 7 days after
the polling day.

If an election poster is causing a hazard to motorists or pedestrians, you can
inform your local authority about these safety concerns.
