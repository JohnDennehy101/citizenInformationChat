##  Introduction

Local elections allow people to elect councillors to represent them in their [
local authorities ](/en/government-in-ireland/how-government-works/local-and-
regional-government/functions-of-local-authorities/) . The elections are held
every 5 years, in the month of May or June. The last local election was on 7
June 2024.

There are 31 local authorities in Ireland, including County Councils, City
Councils, and City and County Councils. Each county, city, and city and county
council is divided into [ local electoral areas
](https://boundarycommittee.ie/) . Each local electoral area has a certain
number of councillors to elect.

The polling date is set by the Minister for Housing, Local Government and
Heritage. The polling period must last at least 12 hours between 7am and
10.30pm and be held on the same day in all of the local authority areas.

##  Can I vote in a local election?

you must be ordinarily resident in Ireland to vote. You may not vote in both a
county council and a city council election.

](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2009/act/9/enacted/en/html) allows people
to display election posters for a certain period. They can be displayed from
the date the Minister appoints the polling day by order, or 30 days before
polling day, whichever is shorter. They must be taken down within 7 days after
the polling day.

If an election poster is causing a hazard to motorists or pedestrians, you can
inform your local authority about these safety concerns.
