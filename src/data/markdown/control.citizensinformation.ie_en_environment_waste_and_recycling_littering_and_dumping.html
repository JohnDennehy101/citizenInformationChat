##  What is litter

Litter is any type of rubbish left lying in an open or public place. This
includes everything from disposable vapes to dog poo and unwanted furniture.

Local authorities can [ penalise
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1997/act/12/enacted/en/html) you if you
litter. The Gardaí can also issue on-the-spot fines for litter offences.

##  Who is responsible for keeping places litter-free?

###  Local authorities and litter prevention

Local authorities are responsible for keeping public places in their area
clear of litter. Their duties include:

  * Street cleaning 
  * Providing and emptying litter bins 
  * Enforcing fines 
  * Enforcing littering rules and regulations and taking legal action against people who don't follow the law 

Local authorities also:

  * Prepare litter management plans, in consultation with the local community. A plan must set out how the local authority will prevent and control litter and make people more aware of litter 
  * Carry out litter pollution surveys and send the data to the [ National Litter Monitoring System ](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/5a64c-national-litter-pollution-monitoring-scheme/) , which assesses changes over time 
  * Offer grants for anti-litter and anti-graffiti awareness projects, such as the [ TidyTowns competition ](https://www.tidytowns.ie/)

###  Litter and public places

If you own or are responsible for a place that is open to the public you have
a legal duty to keep the place litter-free, regardless of how the litter got
there. These public places include:

  * School grounds 
  * Public parks 
  * Train or bus stations 
  * The area around shopping centres 

###  Dog fouling

You are responsible for removing your dog’s poo from public places and
disposing of it properly. If you don't, you could get a €150 on-the-spot fine.
Find out more about [ dog control penalties
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/environment/pets-and-wildlife/control-
of-dogs/#ed14e2) .

###  Litter and private property

If you own or live in a property, you must keep any outdoor areas on your
property that can be seen from a public place litter-free. If you don't, you
can be fined or prosecuted by your local authority.

###  Litter blackspots

If you let litter build up in an area that is visible from a public place, the
local authority can tell you to remove the litter. If you don't comply, the
local authority can do whatever is necessary to remove the litter and you will
have to pay the costs for this.

###  Litter control at major events

The promoters or organisers of major events (such as football matches and
music festivals) must ensure that litter control measures are in place around
the venue before, during and after an event. The local authority can do this
for them, but the promoter or organiser must pay for it.

###  Mobile food outlets

If you run a mobile food outlet selling drinks or food, or an outlet such as a
stall selling farm produce, you must provide suitable litter bins. You must
also clean up any litter resulting from your sales, within a 100-metre radius.

##  Littering rules for posters, signs, flyers and plastic bags

###  Posters and signs

It is illegal to put up posters or signs on poles or other structures in
public places, unless you have written permission in advance from the owner of
the pole or structure. Any poster, sign or advertisement must have either the
name and address of:

  * The person promoting or arranging the event being advertised 
  * The person on whose behalf the poster, sign or advertisement is being put up 

Political parties or candidates must remove posters within 7 days of the
election. If posters are not removed by this deadline, the local authority
will remove them and issue an on-the-spot fine of €150 for each offence. Your
local authority has more information on the rules on election posters.

###  Advertising flyers

If you want to distribute advertising leaflets in the street, you should check
with the local authority to see if there are any local litter restrictions. It
is illegal to place advertising leaflets on car windscreens.

###  Plastic bags

Shops that supply plastic bags must charge customers a levy on each shopping
bag. This is to encourage people to use reusable bags. Revenue generated from
the levy goes into the [ Circular Economy Fund
](https://www.localgov.ie/services/waste-management/littering-and-illegal-
dumping) .

The charge is 22 cent per bag and this must be itemised on any invoice, till
receipt or docket you receive. Reusable shopping bags are exempt from the
levy, as long as the retailer charges at least 70 cent for the bag.

To make a complaint about a retailer who is not charging for plastic bags, you
should contact the Environmental Awareness Officer of your [ local authority
](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/942f74-local-authorities/) . Find out more
about the [ plastic bag levy
](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/28528-plastic-
bags/#:~:text=The%20levy%20is%20remitted%20into,at%2022%20cent%20per%20bag.) .

##  Littering fines

Leaving or throwing litter in a public place is an offence and if you are
caught, you may be fined. These fines include:

  * On-the-spot fines of €150 
  * Up to €4,000 if you are convicted in the [ District Court ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/justice/courts-system/district-court/)
  * Up to €600 for every day you continue to litter after a conviction 
  * [ On-the-spot fines of up to €130,000 ](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2003/act/27/enacted/en/html) for causing environmental pollution, and €10,000 per day for continuing offences 

Local authority litter wardens and the Gardaí can issue on-the-spot fines.

If you are convicted of a litter offence, you may have to pay the local
authority’s legal costs.

##  How do I report illegal dumping?

If you notice illegal dumping, you can report it to the local authority. They
can then investigate it and take action. Alternatively, you can report it to
the 24-hour National Environmental Complaints Line – see ‘More information on
litter’ below.

The complaints line will pass your report to the appropriate body, which may
be:

  * A local authority 
  * An Garda Síochána 
  * The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) 

The EPA website provides more information on [ how to make an environmental
complaint ](http://www.epa.ie/enforcement/report/#.VIhHB4lybhl) .

If a local authority can find out who owns material that has been illegally
dumped, the owner can be prosecuted, even if they haven’t been caught in the
act of dumping. Local authorities can also require you, as a householder or
business operator, to say how and where you are disposing of your waste. They
can do this if you do not use a refuse collection service or bring your waste
to an authorised disposal facility.

**Abandoned vehicles and bikes**

**Abandoned vehicles**

If you think a car has been abandoned, you should report it to your local
authority. They will look into it and remove the car, if needed. When you
report it, you should let them know the:

  * Exact location of the car 
  * Make and model of the car 
  * Car registration (if possible) 

The local authority will contact the car owner to see if the car has been
abandoned. They may also put a notice on the car to say it is considered
abandoned and may be removed.

**Abandoned bicycles**

You can report a bicycle that you think is abandoned. A bike is usually
considered abandoned if it:

  * Is in poor condition with missing or broken parts 
  * Has been left unused for a long time 

When reporting it, you should tell the local authority:

  * The exact location of the bike 
  * The bike’ make, model and colour 
  * Any other distinguishing features 

The local authority will investigate and may put a tag on the bike to let the
owner that it may be removed.

##  Getting household rubbish collected

You should put your rubbish in a wheelie-bin or other sturdy refuse bin for
collection, or in strong plastic bags. You should not leave it out too long
before it is due to be collected, as it may attract birds or animals and
create litter.

It is an offence to put your household waste in street litter bins. If you do
this, the local authority can prosecute you. [ Burning household waste
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/environment/waste-and-
recycling/burning-household-waste/) in your garden or home is illegal. Find
out more about [ disposing of household waste
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/environment/waste-and-
recycling/domestic-refuse/) .

##  Litter and The Tidy Towns competition

Litter control is an important part of the national Tidy Towns competition,
which is organised by the [ Department of Rural and Community Development
](https://www.gov.ie/en/organisation/department-of-rural-and-community-
development/) . Towns that take part in the competition are rated on all
aspects of their local environment, including the amount of litter in the
area.

The Tidy Towns competition is launched each year in March or April. Judging
takes place in June, July and August and the results are announced in
September. The Tidy Towns competition is open to every village, town and city
area. If you would like to get involved and help keep your area litter-free,
you should contact your local [ Tidy Towns group
](https://www.tidytowns.ie/get-involved/find-your-local-committee/) .

Find out more about the [ Tidy Towns competition ](https://www.tidytowns.ie/)
