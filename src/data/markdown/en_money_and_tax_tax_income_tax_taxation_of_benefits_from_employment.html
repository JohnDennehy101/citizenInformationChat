#  Taxation of benefits from employment

  * Introduction 
  * How benefits are taxed 
  * Benefits that are exempt from tax 

##  Introduction

Most benefits from employment that you get in addition to your salary are
taxed.

Generally, there are two types of benefits you can get from your employer in
addition to your salary:

  * Money or other benefits that can be turned into money. Examples include tickets to events, vouchers or having your bills paid by your employer. 
  * Benefits-in-kind. These are benefits that cannot be converted into cash but have a cash value. They are usually something that an employee has the use of without owning it. Examples include loans at a special rate or the use of a company car or accommodation. 

##  How benefits are taxed

Most benefits are added to your pay and taxed in the same way. Your employer
deducts income tax, Universal Social Charge (USC) and Pay Related Social
Insurance (PRSI) on the value of the benefit.

The rules applying to benefits-in-kind vary. Generally, the value of the
benefit is the higher of:

  * The cost to the employer 
  * The market value of the benefit 

If the employee contributes an amount towards the benefit, the taxable value
of the benefit is reduced by that amount.

Special rules apply to the following benefits-in-kind:

  * [ Use of a car ](https://www.revenue.ie/en/employing-people/benefit-in-kind-for-employers/private-use-company-cars/index.aspx)
  * [ Use of a van ](https://www.revenue.ie/en/employing-people/benefit-in-kind-for-employers/private-use-of-company-vans/index.aspx)
  * [ Use of other assets ](https://www.revenue.ie/en/employing-people/benefit-in-kind-for-employers/free-use-of-assets/index.aspx)
  * [ Preferential loans ](https://www.revenue.ie/en/employing-people/benefit-in-kind-for-employers/other-benefits/preferential-loans.aspx)
  * [ Accommodation ](https://www.revenue.ie/en/employing-people/benefit-in-kind-for-employers/free-or-subsidised-accommodation/index.aspx)

##  Benefits that are exempt from tax

Benefits are usually not taxable if you earn less than €1,905 from your
employer in the tax year . This exemption does not apply to company directors.

There are some types of [ benefits that are not taxable
](https://www.revenue.ie/en/jobs-and-pensions/taxation-of-employer-
benefits/non-taxable-employer-benefits.aspx) . These include:

  * [ Travel passes ](https://www.revenue.ie/en/employing-people/benefit-in-kind-for-employers/travel-passes-and-air-miles/index.aspx)
  * Bike and safety equipment under the [ Cycle to Work Scheme ](/en/travel-and-recreation/cycling/cycle-to-work-scheme/)
  * [ Certain employee share schemes and profit-sharing schemes ](/en/money-and-tax/tax/tax-on-savings-and-investments/employee-share-option-schemes/)
  * Canteen facilities 
  * [ Some types of accommodation ](https://www.revenue.ie/en/employing-people/benefit-in-kind-for-employers/free-or-subsidised-accommodation/index.aspx)
  * Employer contributions to approved pension schemes 
  * Phones and computer equipment for business use (where any private use is incidental) 

###  Small benefit exemption

The [ small benefit exemption ](https://www.revenue.ie/en/employing-
people/benefit-in-kind-for-employers/valuation-of-benefits/small-benefit-
exemption.aspx) allows you to get some vouchers or other non-cash benefits
each year without paying tax on them.

From 1 January 2022, you can get up to 2 benefits each year, up to a total
value of €1,000. If more benefits are given in a year, only the first 2
benefits qualify.

The vouchers or benefits can only be used to purchase goods or services. They
cannot be exchanged for cash.
