#  Payments to carers

  * Introduction 

##  Introduction

Carers may be entitled to a number of supports from the Department of Social
Protection. If you are caring for someone, a disabled child or adult or an
older person, you may qualify for a carer's payment. The two main social
welfare payments for carers providing full-time care are Carer's Allowance and
Carer's Benefit. You may also qualify for an annual Carer's Support Grant.

[ Carer's Benefit ](/en/social-welfare/carers/carers-benefit/) is a short-term
payment paid for up to 24 months to people who give up employment to care on a
full-time basis for someone who requires full-time care and attention. After
one year's service, employees may take unpaid [ Carer's Leave
](/en/employment/employment-rights-and-conditions/leave-and-holidays/carers-
leave/) of up to 2 years to provide full-time care for someone who needs it.
Carer's Benefit may be paid during this time. Additional payments are made if
you are looking after more than one person. If you do not qualify for Carer's
Benefit you may qualify for Carer's Allowance.

[ Carer's Allowance ](/en/social-welfare/carers/carers-allowance/) is a
payment for people who are caring on a full-time basis for someone who
requires full-time care and attention and will require it for at least 12
months. You must satisfy a means test and the habitual residency condition. [
A half-rate Carer's Allowance ](/en/social-welfare/carers/half-rate-carers-
allowance/) is payable with certain other social welfare payments, this means
that you can keep your main social welfare payment and get half-rate Carer's
Allowance as well. If you get Carer's Allowance you are entitled to a [ Free
Travel Pass ](/en/social-welfare/extra-social-welfare-benefits/free-travel/) .

If the person you are caring for is under 16 you must be getting Domiciliary
Care Allowance to qualify for Carer's Allowance.

[ Domiciliary Care Allowance ](/en/social-welfare/disability-and-
illness/domiciliary-care-allowance/) is a monthly payment made to the carer of
a child with a severe disability who lives at home. When your child reaches 16
years of age he or she may qualify for Disability Allowance. If you continue
to provide full-time care and attention for your child you can retain your
carer's payment.

If you are caring for a dependent child you may be entitled to an [
Incapacitated Child Tax Credit
](http://www.revenue.ie/en/tax/it/leaflets/it18.pdf) . If you are employing a
carer, you may be entitled to claim a [ tax allowance for employing a carer
for a disabled person ](http://www.revenue.ie/en/tax/it/leaflets/it47.pdf) .

[ The Car ](/en/social-welfare/carers/carers-support-grant/) [ er's Support
Grant ](/en/social-welfare/carers/carers-support-grant/) is an annual payment
made to carers, aged 16 or over, providing full-time care for at least 6
months a year. However, this period must include the first Thursday in June.
You are allowed to work for a certain number of hours each week. A Carer's
Support Grant is paid for each person being cared for. If you are getting
Carer's Allowance, Carer's Benefit or Domiciliary Care Allowance you do not
need to apply for the grant, it is automatically paid to you in June. [
Respite care ](/en/health/health-services/health-services-for-people-with-
disabilities/respite-care/) can allow any carer to take a break from caring.

Under the [ Homemaker's Scheme ](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-
system/social-insurance-prsi/homemakers-scheme/) or the [ HomeCaring Periods
Scheme ](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/social-insurance-
prsi/homecaring-periods-scheme/) a certain period of time caring will not
affect any entitlement you may have to the State Pension (Contributory).
