##  Introduction

The breakdown of a marriage or relationship can be a difficult and traumatic
process, particularly where children are involved. It changes the family
structure and can reduce the daily presence and availability of one parent. It
is important to support your children’s well-being and rights throughout the
process, to help them adjust to the separation or divorce.

Some children will need extra support to deal with the emotional impact of the
change and sense of loss. Parents and children dealing with relationship
breakdown can get support from:

  * [ One Family ](https://onefamily.ie/)
  * [ Treoir ](https://www.treoir.ie/)
  * [ Rainbows Ireland ](https://www.rainbowsireland.ie/)
  * [ Barnardos ](https://www.barnardos.ie/)
  * [ Childline ](https://www.childline.ie/)
  * [ ISPCC ](https://www.ispcc.ie/)
  * [ Family Mediation Service ](https://www.legalaidboard.ie/en/our-services/family-mediation/)

If you have decided to separate or divorce and children are involved, you will
need to consider certain issues such as guardianship, custody, access and
child maintenance.

##  Guardianship

Guardianship is where parents have the legal responsibility to make decisions
on behalf of their child and perform duties in relation to their child's
upbringing. Married parents are automatically joint guardians of their
children. Neither separation nor divorce changes this.

However, a father who is not married to the mother of his child does not have
automatic guardianship rights in relation to that child. You can read more
about the [ guardianship status of fathers ](/en/birth-family-
relationships/married-couples/guardianship-status-of-fathers/) .

##  Custody

Custody refers to the day-to-day care, residency and upbringing of children
who are regarded as _dependent children_ . In custody matters, dependent
children are children who are under the age of 18. In cases of [ judicial
separation ](/en/birth-family-relationships/separation-and-divorce/judicial-
separation/) or [ divorce ](/en/birth-family-relationships/separation-and-
divorce/divorce-decrees/) , one parent is usually granted custody. The
children live permanently with the parent who has custody and the other parent
is granted access to the children at agreed times (which can include overnight
access). Read more about access below.

It is possible for parents to continue having joint custody of their children
after separation or divorce and for the children to spend an equal amount of
time with each parent, if the parents can agree and arrange this.

##  Access

Access refers to your child's right to have direct contact with the parent
they do not live with. It can include the child staying overnight either
occasionally, on alternate weekends or during school holidays. It can also
include the parent and child going on holidays together.

The parents may informally agree between themselves the arrangements for
custody and access to the child.

If an agreement cannot be reached, either parent may apply to the court to
decide which parent will have custody of the child and what access the non-
custodial parent will have. You can make an application to the District Court,
or can apply for [ judicial separation ](/en/birth-family-
relationships/separation-and-divorce/judicial-separation/) or [ divorce
](/en/birth-family-relationships/separation-and-divorce/divorce-decrees/) in
the [ Circuit Court ](/en/justice/courts-system/circuit-court/) .

In an application for custody or access, the child’s welfare is the most
important factor the court will consider. Your child has a right to see both
parents, and access by the non-custodial parent will only be denied if the
court believes it is not in the best interest of the child. The court can set
out the time, place and duration of access visits. The court can also order
supervised access where another adult is present during visits, if it
considers it appropriate.

If you want to get an access order, you can go to your local [ District Court
](/en/justice/courts-system/district-court/) and get the Court Clerk to issue
an application for access, which will be served on the other spouse. You are
advised to get legal advice and representation for this process.

##  Child maintenance

There is a legal responsibility on parents, whether married or unmarried, to
maintain dependent children in accordance with their means. A dependent child
is a child who is under the age of 18, or 23 if they are in full-time
education. Maintenance can be paid periodically (for example, weekly,
fortnightly or monthly) or in a lump sum. Paying maintenance does not give a
parent access or guardianship rights.

Child maintenance can be a private arrangement between you and the other
parent, or if you can't come to an agreement, either person can apply to the
court for a maintenance order.

You can bring an application for maintenance either in the [ District Court
](/en/justice/courts-system/district-court/) or [ Circuit Court
](/en/justice/courts-system/circuit-court/) (or, in exceptional cases, in the
[ High Court ](/en/justice/courts-system/high-court/) ).

##  Get help agreeing

[ Family mediation ](/en/birth-family-relationships/separation-and-
divorce/family-mediation-separating-couples/) can help you and your ex-partner
agree on child arrangements. A mediator is independent and does not take
sides.

Mediation is not relationship counselling. If you know there is no possibility
of reconciliation, mediation can help you agree on the details of how you’ll
look after your children, such as:

  * Where they live 
  * When they spend time with each parent 
  * When and what other types of contact take place (phone calls, for example) 
  * Child maintenance payments 

Mediation allows you and your ex-partner to make your own decisions, rather
than going to court and having a judge make them for you. Mediation can be an
effective, cheaper and quicker alternative to court.

At the end of mediation, you will get a document showing what you agreed. This
agreement is not legally binding. The mediated agreement is not a legal
agreement, however, you can bring this document to a solicitor to be drawn
into a legal contract or deed of separation. You may also use it as the basis
for a decree of divorce.

You can read more about [ family mediation for separating couples ](/en/birth-
family-relationships/separation-and-divorce/family-mediation-separating-
couples/) . You can also find more details on what mediation is and how it
works in [ Mediation for separating couples (pdf)
](https://www.themii.ie/ckeditor_uploads/files/mii_separating_couples.pdf) ,
published by the [ Mediators’ Institute of Ireland ](https://www.themii.ie/) .

##  Going to court

If you cannot agree on your child arrangements, you can apply to the court for
the court to decide. Your child’s welfare is the most important factor the
court will consider.

Some family law issues are resolved without legal representation but it is
always recommended you get legal advice. A solicitor who specialises in family
law can help you by explaining the process and your options. Find [ contact
information for solicitors throughout Ireland
](https://www.lawsociety.ie/Find-a-Solicitor) on the Law Society website.
