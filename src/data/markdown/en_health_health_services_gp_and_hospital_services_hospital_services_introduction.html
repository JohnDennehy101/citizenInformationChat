##  What types of hospitals are available in Ireland?

There are 3 different types of hospitals in Ireland:

  * **Public hospitals** run by the State through the [ Health Service Executive ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/health/health-system/health-service-executive/)
  * **Voluntary public hospitals,** are mainly state-funded but are sometimes owned by private bodies. For example, religious orders. Other voluntary public hospitals are run by boards often appointed by the Minister for Health 
  * **Private hospitals** receive no state funding 

##  How to get treatment in a hospital in Ireland

You will need a letter of referral from your GP (family doctor) if you need
hospital treatment.

You can go to the Emergency Departments (also called Accident and Emergency)
in most general hospitals and some specialist hospitals without a letter of
referral, but you may be [ charged for your visit ](/en/health/health-
services/gp-and-hospital-services/hospital-charges/) .

[ View contact information for public hospitals in your area
](http://www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/3/acutehospitals/hospitals/) .

Read about [ health services for visitors to Ireland
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/health/health-system/health-services-
and-visitors-to-ireland/) and your [ entitlement to health services
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/health/health-system/entitlement-to-
public-health-services/) in Ireland.

##  Public hospital patients

If you are a public patient you do not have to pay for consultants' services
and you do not have a choice of consultants.

In many areas, there can be waiting lists for non-emergency services. You can
check information on [ waiting times for in-patient treatment
](http://www.ntpf.ie/home/nwld.htm) .

You can get public health services in [ HSE hospitals and
](http://www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/3/acutehospitals/hospitals/) in public
voluntary hospitals. Most of these hospitals also provide private health care
but they must clearly distinguish between public and private hospital beds.

##  Private patients

If you choose to be a private patient in a public hospital, you become the
private patient of the consultant treating you and you must pay for all the
treatments and services you get from them. There is also a set [ daily charge
for private patients in public hospitals. ](/en/health/health-services/gp-and-
hospital-services/hospital-charges/)

Private hospitals can set their own charges for patients. [ Private health
insurance ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/health/health-
system/private-health-insurance/) may cover some or all of the cost.

##  What services can I get in a hospital?

####  **Acute services**

If you are seriously ill or injured you can go to an acute hospital for
diagnoses, treatment and care. Acute hospital services are in HSE hospitals,
public voluntary hospitals and private hospitals. Some hospitals are
specialist, for example, maternity or psychiatric hospitals, while others are
general.

####  **General, regional and local hospitals**

You can get treatment for many issues at large general and regional hospitals.
Smaller local hospitals may not be able to cater for all illnesses and
treatments and you may be transferred to a larger hospital or to a specialist
hospital. You can [ find the location and contact details of your local
hospital ](https://www2.hse.ie/services/hospitals/) .

**Inpatient or day-case**

If you are getting planned (scheduled) care or emergency (unscheduled) care,
this is known as inpatient care. This includes care needing an overnight stay
the hospital as well as care provided through the day case services.

**Out-patient services**

If you have an out-patient appointment, you will not be staying overnight in
the hospital. Your family doctor can refer you for a planned appointment in an
**out-patients** department of a public hospital. This will be with a
consultant or their team or for diagnostic assessments (for example, x-rays,
laboratory tests, physiotherapy).

**Emergency Department**

If you have serious injuries or life-threatening emergencies, you can go to
the Emergency Department (sometimes called Accident and Emergency Department).
This is usually as an out-patient. They are open 24 hours a day, every day of
the year. [ Find your local Emergency Department.
](https://www2.hse.ie/services/emergency-departments/)

Phone 112 or 999 if you need urgent medical help or you're not sure what to
do.

**Minor injury unit**

If you have a minor injury, [ check if your local minor injury unit may be
able treat you ](https://www2.hse.ie/emergencies/when-to-visit-an-injury-
unit/#What-injury-units-can-treat) . There is a â‚¬75 charge to attend an injury
unit. There is no charge for patients with a medical card, or a medical or GP
referral letter.

Minor injuries are unlikely to require admission to a hospital. You can [
check where the nearest minor injury unit is to you
](https://www2.hse.ie/services/injury-units/) .
