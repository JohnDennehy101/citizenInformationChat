##  Information for school leavers

The Citizens Information Board has published a booklet, [ Information for
school leavers (pdf)
](https://www.citizensinformationboard.ie/en/publications/information/leaflets.html)
. It covers many of the questions about education and employment you may have
when you leave school. It also has information on managing your money, paying
tax and accessing health services.

##  I want to go to university

If you intend [ going on to third-level education ](/en/education/third-level-
education/colleges-and-qualifications/going-to-college/) when you leave
school, you can find out [ how to apply to college ](/en/education/third-
level-education/applying-to-college/application-procedures-and-entry-
requirements/) . The Central Applications Office (CAO) offers places based on
Leaving Certificate results. If you have a disability you may be eligible for
the [ DARE access route ](/en/education/third-level-education/applying-to-
college/third-level-admissions-scheme-for-students-with-disabilities/) and if
you come from a disadvantaged background you may be eligible for [ HEAR
](/en/education/third-level-education/applying-to-college/third-level-
admissions-scheme-for-students-from-disadvantaged-backgrounds/) .

A new pathway to a degree is provided by the [ Tertiary education programme
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/education/third-level-
education/applying-to-college/tertiary-education-programme/) . You do not
apply through the CAO. You start your degree programme in a further education
college and finish it in a higher education (third level) college or
university.

You can find out about [ fees and supports for third-level education
](/en/education/third-level-education/fees-and-supports-for-third-level-
education/) .

##  I want to learn skills for work

Another option when you leave school is a [ further education and training
(FET) course ](/en/education/further-education-and-training/training-courses/)
. FET courses can give school leavers the skills for work.

You can apply for an [ apprenticeship
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/education/vocational-education-and-
training/apprenticeships/) to be trained in a traditional craft apprenticeship
such as plumbing or carpentry or a new apprenticeship such as accounts
technician.

[ Post Leaving Certificate (PLC) courses ](/en/education/further-education-
and-training/post-leaving-certificate-courses/) can develop your technical and
practical skills for an industry-recognised qualification.

[ Youthreach ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/education/vocational-
education-and-training/youthreach/) also runs paid training courses for early
school-leavers.

The [ Right Course ](https://www.gov.ie/en/campaigns/f205a-the-right-
course/?referrer=http://www.gov.ie/therightcourse/) is an online portal with
information on further education and training places, higher education courses
and information if you are on a social welfare payment and want to begin a
course.

If you are planning to learn or work in Europe, you can use [ Europass
](/en/education/european-education-programmes/europass/) to search for
qualifications, courses and learning opportunities in other EU countries.

##  Starting work

If you are taking up a job, you should familiarise yourself with your [
employment rights
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/employment/employment-rights-and-
conditions/) . Find out about [ minimum rates of pay
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/employment/employment-rights-and-
conditions/pay-and-employment/minimum-wage/) , [ contracts of employment
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/employment/employment-rights-and-
conditions/contracts-of-employment/contract-of-employment/) , [ holidays and
leave ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/employment/employment-rights-
and-conditions/leave-and-holidays/) , particularly if you are [ starting work
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/employment/starting-work-and-changing-
job/) for the first time. You may also plan to [ work abroad.
