  * Vaccine catch-up program 
  * More information 

##  Introduction

Immunisation is a safe and effective way to help your body prevent or fight
off certain diseases. You can get immunisation through vaccinations.

You can get your child vaccinated under the:

  * [ Childhood Immunisation Programme ](https://www.hse.ie/eng/health/immunisation/pubinfo/pcischedule/immschedule/) , 
  * [ School Immunisation Programme ](https://www.hse.ie/eng/health/immunisation/pubinfo/schoolprog/)
  * HSE catch-up program 

Check the table below to see what age to get your child vaccinated.

###  **How much do these vaccinations cost?**

These vaccinations are free of charge.

###  **Parental consent for vaccines**

If you are under 16, you must get your parent or guardian's consent for
vaccinations.

Vaccination is not compulsory but is strongly advised by the Department of
Health. You should discuss any concerns you may have with your GP (family
doctor) before making a decision about your childâ€™s immunisation.

##  Where to get your child vaccinated in Ireland

You are usually offered your child's vaccinations by:

  * The hospital where your baby was born 
  * The HSE 
  * Your GP 
  * The School Immunisation Programme or 
  * The HSE catch-up program 

You can also contact your [ Local Health Office
](http://www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/1/LHO/) or your GP directly.

**Vaccines for babies**

You will usually be offered vaccines for your baby from your GP (family
doctor) until they are 13 months, as part of the [ Primary Childhood
Immunisation Schedule
](https://www.hse.ie/eng/health/immunisation/pubinfo/pcischedule/) . You can
also get your baby vaccinated in hospitals and health clinics.

You should make sure your baby gets their vaccinations on time, or as soon as
possible after they are due. If your baby is due to have a routine
vaccination, you should phone your GP to arrange it.

####  RSV vaccine for newborns 2024-2025

If your baby is born between September 2024 and February 2025, the HSE will
offer your baby the vaccine to protect against RSV (respiratory syncytial
virus).

This is a temporary programme run by the HSE. You can find more information on
the [ RSV vaccine on the HSE website
](https://www2.hse.ie/conditions/rsv/immunisation/) .

Read more [ information about vaccines available for your baby (pdf).
](https://www.hse.ie/eng/health/immunisation/pubinfo/pcischedule/engyourchildsimm.pdf)

**Vaccines at school**

When your child starts school, they can get more vaccinations under the [
School Immunisation Programme
](https://www.hse.ie/eng/health/immunisation/pubinfo/schoolprog/) .

During winter, you can usually get the flu vaccine for your child if they are
aged from 2 to 17. The [ flu vaccine for children
](https://www2.hse.ie/conditions/flu/childrens-flu-vaccine/) is given by nasal
spray rather than injection.

##  Vaccine catch-up program

If you or your child missed certain vaccines when they were offered, the HSE
can sometimes provide these vaccines later in life. Catch-up programs are
often only available to certain age groups and during a specific time period.

###  MMR catch-up program

Your child will usually be offered the MMR (measles, mumps and rubella)
vaccine when they are 12 months old, followed by a second dose when they are
aged 4-5 years old in junior infants.

Usually, children can get the MMR until they are aged under 10 years, but
currently you can book an appointment for an MMR vaccine at any age if you or
your child has missed the MMR vaccine. This is known as the [ MMR catch-up
program
](https://www.hse.ie/eng/health/immunisation/news/mmrcatchupprogramme.html) .

Adults born in Ireland before 1978 are likely to have had measles infection
and so would not need to get the MMR vaccination.

###  **HPV catch-up program**

The HPV catch-up program ended on 31 December 2023.

[ Read more about the HPV vaccine on the HSE website
](https://www.hse.ie/eng/health/immunisation/pubinfo/schoolprog/hpv/about/about.html)

##  More information

You can get information about all immunisations from your GP, public health
nurse or [ Local Health Office ](https://www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/1/lho/)
