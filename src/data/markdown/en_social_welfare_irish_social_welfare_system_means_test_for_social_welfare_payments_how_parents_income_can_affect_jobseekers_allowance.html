#  How parents' income can affect Jobseeker's Allowance

  * How to calculate benefit and privilege 
  * An example showing how to calculate benefit and privilege 

##  Introduction

When you apply for Jobseeker's Allowance, your [ means ](/en/social-
welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/means-test-for-social-welfare-
payments/means-test/) are assessed to see whether you will qualify. If you are
24 years of age or under and you are living with a parent or a step-parent in
the family home, your parents' income is also taken into account. The
Department of Social Protection call this an assessment of the _benefit and
privilege_ you get from living with your parents.

This means, while you may have no income, your parents' income can affect your
social welfare payment. If however your only means are from the benefit of
your parents' income and those means are **less** than the personal rate of
Jobseeker's Allowance, the minimum weekly payment you are entitled to is €40.

Some people may still refer to _benefit and privilege_ as 'board and
lodgings'.

##  Rules

To be assessed for benefit and privilege you must:

  * Be 24 years of age or under 
  * Be living with a parent or step-parent in the family home 
  * Have applied for [ Jobseeker’s Allowance (JA) ](/en/social-welfare/unemployed-people/jobseekers-allowance/) or [ Supplementary Welfare Allowance (SWA) ](/en/social-welfare/supplementary-welfare-schemes/supplementary-welfare-allow/) . 

**If you are living with your spouse, civil partner or cohabitant and living
with your parents you will not be assessed for benefit and privilege, even if
you are under 25 years of age.**

**If you have lived elsewhere in Ireland (or abroad) independent of your
parents for at least 3 years, benefit and privilege is assessed as €7.**

##  How to calculate benefit and privilege

**Step 1** , add together your parents' net income from all sources. (Net
income is your gross income less income tax, PRSI, [ Universal Social Charge
](/en/money-and-tax/tax/income-tax/universal-social-charge/) , private health
insurance contribution, superannuation and union dues).

For example, your parents' net income includes income from:

  * Insurable employment 
  * Self-employment 
  * Community Employment (CE) schemes and [ Further Education and Training (FET) training allowances ](/en/education/further-education-and-training/training-allowances/)
  * Maintenance payments 
  * An occupational pension 
  * All social welfare payments with the exception of the following: Fuel Allowance, Child Benefit, Guardian's Payment, Domiciliary Care Allowance and Carer's Support Grant. 
  * All Health Service Executive Payments with the exception of the following: Blind Welfare Allowance and Foster Care Allowance. 
  * Net income from property other than the family home. So, for example, rental income (less expenses such as mortgage repayments, insurance costs and repairs) is taken into account. The capital value of property is not taken into account. 

Capital assessment: Capital usually includes saving, investments and property
(other than your home). Capital which belongs to your parents is not taken
into account in the assessment of benefit and privilege.

**Step 2** , deduct the following from your parent’s net income to get their
assessable income:

  * Rent or mortgage repayments 
  * Standard weekly allowance of €600 for a two-parent family or €470 for a one-parent family 
  * €30 for each child up to 18 years of age and for all children over 18 years in full-time education. However, you cannot deduct €30 for a child who is getting a social welfare payment in his/her own right. For example, if there is a child 17 years of age and getting Disability Allowance in the household, you cannot deduct €30 from parental weekly income for this child. The child's social welfare payment is **not** included as income. 

**Step 3** , after you have calculated your parents' assessable income, get
34% of this income. Only **34%** of your parents' assessable income is taken
into account and assessed as benefit and privilege. You subtract this amount
from the standard rate of Jobseeker's Allowance for your circumstances to find
out how much, if any, you qualify for.

##  An example showing how to calculate benefit and privilege

Example 1

A one-parent family with 4 children. Two of the children are still in school,
one child in an apprenticeship and the claimant (The claimant is 24 years of
age and applying for Jobseeker's Allowance).

Parent’s net weekly income €590  
Less deductions from net income ***** €630  
Total -€40

***** Less weekly mortgage repayments of €100 and weekly disregard for
children of €60 (€30 x 2 children) and one-parent standard weekly allowance of
€470 (€100 + €60 + €470 = €630).

In this case, parental income of €590 is less than the total amount of
deductions, which is €630. Therefore, parental income is assessed as NIL and
will not affect the Jobseeker's Allowance claim.

Example 2

If we take the same situation of a one-parent family with 4 children. Two of
the children are still in school, one child in an apprenticeship and the
fourth is the claimant (who is 24 years of age and applying for Jobseeker's
Allowance). If we increase the parent's income to €800 per week, benefit and
privilege is calculated as follows:

Parent’s net weekly income €800  
Less deductions from net income* €630  
Total €170

***** Less weekly mortgage repayments of €100 and weekly disregard for
children of €60 (€30 x 2 children) and one-parent standard weekly allowance of
€470 (€100 + €60 + €470 = €630).

34% of the above total of €170 = €58 (rounded up from €57.80)

Maximum weekly Jobseeker's Allowance payment €141.70 less €58 = €83.70 (see
'Note' below)

**Amount of Jobseeker's Allowance payable to claimant = €83.70**

**Note:** People under 25 get an age-related rate of Jobseeker's Allowance.
More information on the JA rates for people under 25 can be found in our page
on [ Jobseeker's Allowance ](/en/social-welfare/unemployed-people/jobseekers-
allowance/) .
