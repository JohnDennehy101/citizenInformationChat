  * Immigration detention 
  * Further information 

##  Introduction

The [ Minister for Justice
](http://www.justice.ie/en/JELR/Pages/our_ministers) is responsible for the
prison system in Ireland. However, [ the Irish Prison Service
](https://www.irishprisons.ie/) , an executive office established [ within the
Department of Justice
](http://www.justice.ie/en/JELR/Pages/irish_prison_service_role) , controls
the day-to-day operation of Irish prisons.

The Irish Prison Service is responsible for the safe and secure custody of all
those committed to it by the courts. This includes people [ held on remand
](/en/justice/arrests/detention-after-arrest/) , [ detained on immigration
matters
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2015/act/66/section/20/enacted/en/html#sec20)
and [ sentenced to imprisonment ](/en/justice/criminal-law/criminal-
trial/types-of-sentences#le06e6) .

In addition to ensuring that convicted people properly serve their sentences,
the Irish Prison Service is responsible for providing prisoners with
appropriate resources and opportunities to reduce the likelihood of their
reoffending and assisting prisoners with [ reintegrating into their
communities upon release ](https://www.irishprisons.ie/prisoner-
services/reintegration/) .

This document provides practical information about the structure and operation
of the prison system in Ireland. It includes information on:

  * Prison facilities in Ireland 
  * Committal and admission procedures 
  * Prison transfers 
  * Supports for families of prisoners; and 
  * Detention on immigration matters 

The Irish Prison Service deals exclusively with offenders who are **18 years
of age or over** . You can find out more about [ children and the criminal
justice system in Ireland ](/en/justice/children-and-young-offenders/children-
and-the-criminal-justice-system-in-ireland/) .

Section 35 of the [ Prisons Act 2007
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2007/en/act/pub/0010/index.html) provides for
the making of rules for the regulation and good government of prisons. [
Prison Rules 2007 (SI 252/2007)
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2007/en/si/0252.html) , as [ amended
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/ResultsSITitle.html?q=Prison+Rules&q=2013&q=2014&search_type=si&button=Search)
, sets out, among other things, the rules in relation to admissions and
transfers.

##  Prison facilities in Ireland

There are 12 institutions in the Irish prison system. Ten are traditional
closed facilities with both internal and perimeter security, while 2 are open
centres with reduced security measures.

Open prisons operate a regime based on the voluntarily accepted discipline of
the prisoners. By providing prisoners with more independence and
responsibility, as well as increased access to educational, employment and
developmental opportunities, open centres are designed to prepare offenders
for their reintegration into civil society upon release.

The majority of female prisoners are accommodated in [ the purpose built
Dóchas Centre ](https://www.irishprisons.ie/prison/dochas-centre/) in [
Mountjoy Prison in Co. Dublin ](https://www.irishprisons.ie/prison/mountjoy-
prison/) , with the remainder accommodated in [ Limerick Prison
](https://www.irishprisons.ie/prison/limerick-prison/) .

##  Admission and committal to prison

If you have been convicted of a crime and [ sentenced to a term of
imprisonment ](/en/justice/criminal-law/criminal-trial/sentence/) , or if you
have been [ remanded in custody ](/en/justice/arrests/detention-after-arrest/)
pending a further court appearance, a judge will issue a warrant addressed to
the Governor of one of the committal prisons listed above.

The type of prison to which you are committed depends on multiple factors,
including:

  * The nature of your offence and your previous offending record 
  * Your previous behaviour in custody and the level of risk you are understood to pose to other prisoners and prison staff 
  * Prison availability 
  * Security concerns in relation to you 
  * Access relevant rehabilitation facilities; and 
  * Proximity to your family home 

You can [ access detailed information ](https://www.irishprisons.ie/prisons/)
on all the prison facilities in Ireland on the Irish Prison Service website.
You can also find out more about your [ rights and entitlements
](/en/justice/prison-system/prisoners-rights/) as a prisoner.

###  Committal process

You can only be committed to prison with a valid committal order from a court,
which the Garda or prison officer must give to the relevant prison Governor.

In most cases, upon being committed to prison, you will be brought the
reception area where your name, address, date of birth, nearest relative,
occupation, religion and other details will be recorded. If you have been
convicted of a crime, your photograph, fingerprints and palm prints will be
taken and sent to the Gardaí.

You will be searched by a prison officer of your own gender. Your decency,
privacy and dignity should be respected during the search. If you refuse to be
searched, the prison officer may only use such force as is reasonably
necessary to carry out the search.

A list of all your personal property will be made when you enter prison. Any
banned items, such as prohibited substances or weapons, will be confiscated,
while valuable items, such as jewellery or mobile phones, will be noted and
stored safely in the General Office for return upon your release.

Any money taken from you will be lodged in an account in the General Office.
Friends and family members [ can put money into this account
](https://www.irishprisons.ie/lodging-money-prisoner-account/) for you and
they will be given a receipt. If you do not spend all your money in prison you
will get it back when you are released.

You will be weighed and measured. Details of any marks or scars on your body
should be put in your personal prison file. You will be asked to disclose any
history of substance abuse or mental illness in order that appropriate
supports can be arranged. If you believe it is not safe for you to be among
other prisoners or, if you wish to be placed on protection, you should tell
the prison staff.

The Garda or prison officer who brought you to prison must give the Governor
any medication or prescriptions belonging to you and pass on any information
they have about your health. If possible, you should be examined by a doctor
on the day of your committal, or as soon as possible thereafter.

The prison Governor, or somebody who represents them, should meet with you
within 24 hours of your committal to prison. You should be provided with a
booklet explaining the prison’s rules, your rights and entitlements as a
prisoner, and your responsibilities to prison staff and other inmates. If you
are a foreign national, you should, if possible, be given a copy of the prison
booklet in a language you can understand.

You will be allowed to tell a family member or some other person where you are
as soon as possible.

The Irish Council for Civil Liberties and the Irish Penal Reform Trust [ have
published detailed guidance (PDF) ](https://www.iccl.ie/wp-
content/uploads/2017/11/ICCL_Prisoners_rights_BW_2012.pdf) on your rights as a
prisoner, including information on what you can expect upon being committed to
prison.

##  Prison transfers

When you are sentenced to prison, or remanded in custody pending a further
court appearance, you will be committed to the prison named for the court area
where you appeared. However, the prison where you are to serve your sentence
may be changed at any time by the Minister for Justice.

As a prisoner, you have no legal right to serve your sentence in a prison of
your choice. However, you can apply to the Governor for a transfer to another
prison if you have a good reason. In most cases, the Prison Service will try
to make sure you are in a prison as close to your home as possible.

If you are transferred from one prison to another, you should be allowed, as
soon as reasonably possible, to let a family member or friend know that you
have been transferred.

###  International transfers

If you are a foreign national serving a term of imprisonment in Ireland, you
can apply for a transfer to complete your sentence in your home state.

Ireland is a signatory to the [ Council of Europe Convention on the Transfer
of Sentenced Persons ](https://www.coe.int/en/web/conventions/full-
list/-/conventions/treaty/112) . The Treaty, ratified by 66 countries
including 19 states outside the [ Council of Europe ](/en/government-in-
ireland/european-government/eu-institutions/council-of-the-european-union/) ,
provides for the extradition of non-nationals convicted of a criminal offence
to their home country. If a country is not a signatory to the Convention a
transfer will require a bilateral agreement between the two states.

For a transfer to take place, there must be 3-way consent. The prisoner, the
sentencing country and the prisoner’s home country must all agree to the
transfer.

Additionally, you must meet 4 conditions to be eligible to apply for a
transfer:

  1. You must be regarded as a national of the country you wish to be transferred to. 
  2. Your sentence must be final. You cannot apply for transfer before you face trial or until after all appeals have been heard. 
  3. There must be at least 6 months left to serve on your sentence. 
  4. The crime for which you were convicted must also be recognised as a crime in your home country. 

An application for a transfer usually begins with a prisoner informing the
prison authorities of their desire to complete their sentence in their home
country. Alternatively, you can communicate this wish directly to the Minister
for Justice. The Irish Council for Prisoners Overseas have [ produced a
valuable factsheet (PDF) ](https://www.icpo.ie/wp-
content/uploads/2019/10/Repatriation-factsheet-October-2019_FINAL.pdf) on the
process of applying for an international transfer.

The legal complexity of the international transfer process is such that most
applications take a long time. The Minister for Justice produces an [ annual
report (PDF) ](https://www.icpo.ie/wp-
content/uploads/2019/10/Transfer_of_sentenced_persons_-Annual_Report_2018.pdf)
on the operation of the transfer scheme which shows the number of prisoners
transferred in and out of Ireland each year.

##  Supports for families of prisoners

While there is no national organisation responsible for providing information
or support to families affected by imprisonment, there are several voluntary
organisations that perform such a function:

  * The [ Irish Penal Reform Trust (IPRT) ](http://www.iprt.ie/) is a non-governmental organisation that campaigns for the rights of prisoners. The IPRT does not provide a direct service; however, you can access a range of helpful publications, including [ information for prisoners and their families ](http://www.iprt.ie/practical-information) . 
  * [ Care After Prison ](http://careafterprison.ie/family-support/) is a charity organisation which provides support for offenders, their families and victims of crime. They also work closely with families and loved ones of people under sentence and awaiting sentencing. 
  * The [ Childhood Development Initiative (CDI) ](https://www.cdi.ie/) is a Tallaght-based organisation which works to improve outcomes for children, families and communities in Tallaght and throughout Ireland. 
  * [ St Nicholas Trust ](http://www.stnicholastrust.ie/) is a Cork-based organisation that offers help and support to people affected by imprisonment. 
  * [ Bedford Row Family Project ](http://www.bedfordrow.ie/) is based in Limerick and supports family members affected by the imprisonment. It works towards the re-integration of ex-prisoners into their families, their communities, and society in general. 

##  Immigration detention

In general, asylum seekers and irregular immigrants who may be detained under
Irish law include:

  * Non-nationals who arrive in Ireland and are refused leave to land 
  * International protection applicants who are deemed to be in one of the categories set out in Section 20(1) International Protection Act (see below) 
  * International protection applicants being transferred to another EU Member State under the Dublin Regulation who are at risk of absconding 
  * Non-nationals with outstanding deportation orders; and 
  * Non-nationals awaiting trial for a criminal immigration-related offence 

[ Section 20(1) of the International Protection Act 2015
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2015/act/66/enacted/en/print#sec20)
provides that international protection applicants may be detained by an
immigration officer or a member of Garda Síochána and arrested without warrant
if it is suspected that they:

  * Pose a threat to public security or public order in Ireland 
  * Have committed a serious non-political crime outside Ireland 
  * Have not made reasonable efforts to establish their identity (including non-compliance with the requirement to provide fingerprints) 
  * Intend to leave Ireland without lawful authority enter another state 
  * Have acted or plan to act in a manner that would undermine the system for granting persons international protection in Ireland or any arrangement relating to the [ Common Travel Area ](/en/government-in-ireland/ireland-and-the-uk/common-travel-area-between-ireland-and-the-uk/)
  * Have, without reasonable excuse, destroyed identity or travel documents or is in possession of fake identity documents 

There are currently no specialised detention centres for asylum seekers or
irregular migrants in Ireland. If detained under section 20(1) of the
International Protection Act 2015, you can be detained at a Garda station or
Cloverhill Prison. If detained at Cloverhill Prison, you should be separated
from the general prison population. Persons under 18 years of age cannot be
detained.

There is no maximum duration for the detention of protection applicants set
out in the International Protection Act. Section 20(12) indicates that a [
District Court ](/en/justice/courts-system/district-court/) judge can,
provided the relevant criteria are met, apply for detention for consecutive
21-day time periods with no upper limit.

The [ Irish Refugee Council ](https://www.irishrefugeecouncil.ie/) has
published [ detailed guidance and information
](https://www.asylumineurope.org/reports/country/republic-ireland/detention-
asylum-seekers/general) on immigration detention procedures in Ireland. You
can also read more about [ refugee status and leave to remain
