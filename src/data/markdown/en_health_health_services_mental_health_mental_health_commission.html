##  Introduction

The Mental Health Commission is an independent body set up under the [ Mental
Health Act 2001 ](/en/health/health-services/mental-health/mental-health-
act-2001/) .

The Mental Health Commission's role is to:

  * Promote, encourage and foster high standards and good practices in the delivery of mental health services 
  * Protect the interests of people who are detained in approved psychiatric centres 
  * Regulate in-patient mental health services 

##  What does the Mental Health Commission do?

###

The Mental Health Commission (MHC) has a number of responsibilities under the
Act including:

  * Appointing mental health tribunals to review the detention of patients involuntarily detained and appointing a legal representative for each patient. 
  * Establishing and maintaining a [ Register of Approved Centres ](https://www.mhcirl.ie/what-we-do/regulation/approved-centres) that are in-patient facilities providing care and treatment for people with a mental illness and mental disorder. 
  * Making rules regulating the use of specific treatments and interventions such as ECT (Electroconvulsive Therapy), seclusion and mechanical restraint. 
  * Developing [ codes of practice, guidance, standards ](https://www.mhcirl.ie/what-we-do/guidance) for people working in mental health services and enable them to provide high quality care and treatment to service users. 
  * Appointing the [ Inspector of Mental Health Services ](/en/health/health-services/mental-health/inspector-of-mental-health-services/) to inspect approved psychiatric centres annually and report to the MHC. 

The MHC's role was extended by the [ Assisted Decision Making (Capacity) Act
2015 ](/en/health/legal-matters-and-health/assisted-decision-making-act/) ,
which established the Decision Support Service. The Decision Support Service
is for adults who require help, now or in the future, to exercise their right
to make decisions about their personal welfare, property or affairs.

You can read more information on Assisted Decision-Making in our section on [
legal matters and health ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/health/legal-
matters-and-health/) .

](https://www.mhcirl.ie/about/our-board) with responsibility for developing
and implementing the organisation’s strategic plan. The current [ strategic

content/uploads/2023/04/MHR-23-STRATEGIC-PLAN-SCREEN.pdf) runs from 2023 up to

  * General health 
  * Psychiatry 
  * Nursing
