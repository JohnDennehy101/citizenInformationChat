##  What is noise pollution?

Noise pollution can come from different sources, and can be broadly defined as
noise which:

  * Is considered a nuisance 
  * Is dangerous to human health 
  * Could damage property 
  * Could damage the environment 

There are no universal noise standard laws that apply in Ireland but your
local authority may refer to particular noise standards.

Noise pollution is outlined in the [ Environmental Protection Agency Act 1992
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1992/en/act/pub/0007/index.html) .

##  Who do I complain to about noise pollution?

While the law does not mention an exact level or standard of noise that is
illegal, if noise is affecting your quality of life, then you have a right to
complain. Who you complain to depends on the source of the noise.

Your first step should generally be to contact the person causing the noise to
try to fix the issue. If this doesn’t work, you can take the necessary next
steps to make your complaint.

There are different bodies who deal with these complaints, but the 2 main
places to make your complaints are:

  * Local authorities 
  * The [ District Court ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/justice/courts-system/district-court/)

###  **Local authorities**

You can report a noise nuisance to the Environment Section of your [ local
authority ](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/942f74-local-authorities/) , who
can take actions to prevent or limit noise.

Read more detail about [ the role of the local authorities in noise complaints
](https://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1992/act/7/section/108/enacted/en/html#sec108)
.

###  **District Court**

If you are still concerned about excessive noise, you can make a formal
complaint to the District Court. This should be the last step you take to
resolving the issue. This is outlined in [ regulations made under the Act
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1994/en/si/0179.html) .

You can get a complaint form in your local district court office and will have
to pay a fee to process the complaint.

###  **Other organisations for noise complaints**

Depending on the source of the noise, you may complain elsewhere. Other places
where you can lodge a complaint include:

  * [ An Garda Síochánna ](/en/justice/law-enforcement/garda-siochana-national-police-force/)
  * The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) 
  * [ Residential Tenancies Board (RTB) ](/en/housing/renting-a-home/resolving-disputes/residential-tenancies-board/)
  * Transport Infrastructure Ireland (TII) 

You can read the gov.ie [ Guide to Noise Regulations
](https://www.gov.ie/en/service/make-a-noise-nuisance-complaint/) on the steps
you can take if you are experiencing a nuisance caused by noise.

##  How to make a noise complaint

If you plan to complain about excessive noise, try to keep a detailed list of:

  * The times when the noise occurred 
  * How long the noise lasted 
  * The levels of noise involved (if possible) 

###  **Step 1: Try to resolve the issue yourself**

You should first contact the person or business causing the noise, explain
that it is a nuisance and try to solve the issue together.

###  **Step 2: Contact your local authority or the EPA**

If this doesn’t work, you can contact your local authority or the EPA who may
be able to advise you on how to deal with the noise complaint.

The local authority or the EPA are not likely to get involved in disputes
between neighbours.

But if it is coming from an industrial or commercial source, the EPA or the
local authority may serve a notice to those causing the noise.

###  **Step 3: Apply to the District Court**

If this does not work, you can make a noise complaint to the District Court,
following the steps outlined below. There is [ a small fee
](https://www.courts.ie/content/general-summons-copy-information-application-
order-notice-appeal) attached.

**How to apply to the District Court with a noise complaint**

  1. **Get an appointment for a hearing** : Ask the local [ District Court ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/justice/courts-system/district-court/) Clerk about an appointment for a hearing. You will need to refer exactly to the legislation under which you are making the complaint: 
    1. [ Section 108 of the Environmental Protection Agency Act 1992 ](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1992/act/7/section/108/enacted/en/html)
    2. The [ Environmental Protection Agency Act (Noise) Regulations 1994 ](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1994/en/si/0179.html)
  2. **Inform the other party** : At least 7 days before the date of your hearing, you must inform the person or business you are complaining about that you have made a complaint to the District Court about them. 
  3. **Fill in the form** : The District Court will give you a form for making the complaint, which you must fill out in full. 
  4. **Attend the hearing date** : You must then attend court at your appointment time to present you complaint. 

**Outcome of District Court noise complaints**

If the person is making noise during trade or business, they may have a
defence if they can show that:

  * They took all reasonable care to prevent the noise 
  * The noise is in line with a licence issued under [ the Act ](https://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1994/si/179/made/en/print)

If you win the case, the Court can order those responsible for the noise to
take measures to prevent or limit the noise. These orders must be obeyed.

##  What is environmental noise?

Environmental noise means unwanted or harmful outdoor sound created by human
activities. This can come from a variety of sources and includes noise from:

  * Transport 
  * Road traffic 
  * Rail traffic 
  * Air traffic 
  * Industrial sites 

You can experience environmental noise anywhere, for example in or around:

  * Built-up areas 
  * Public parks or other quiet areas within built-up areas 
  * In quiet areas in open country 
  * Schools 
  * Hospitals 
  * Other noise-sensitive buildings and areas 

###  **What is not considered environmental noise?**

In Ireland, environmental noise does not apply to noise:

  * From domestic activities 
  * Created by neighbours 
  * At workplaces 
  * Inside transport vehicles 
  * Due to military activities in military areas 
  * Caused by the person exposed to the noise 

This is outlined in the [ European Communities (Environmental Noise)
Regulations 2018
](https://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2018/si/549/made/en/print) .

###  **What are the impacts of environmental noise?**

If you are exposed to environmental noise long-term, it can have negative
effects on your health. It can:

  * Impact your sleep 
  * Contribute to heart disease 
  * Impact your mental health and wellbeing 
  * Cause annoyance and interfere with your daily activities 
  * Cause cognitive impairment (damage to your ability to think) 
  * Cause hearing problems including [ tinnitus ](https://www2.hse.ie/conditions/tinnitus/)

The EPA have more [ information on the potential impacts of long-term exposure
to environmental noise ](https://www.epa.ie/environment-and-you/noise/noise-
and-your-health/) .

###  **Noise from fireworks**

If there are fireworks being set off where you live, you can report it to [
your local Garda station ](https://www.garda.ie/en/Contact-Us/Station-
Directory/) , or you can call the Garda confidential line on 1800 666 111.

If your pet is distressed by fireworks, [ dogstrust.ie have firework advice
and resources available ](https://www.dogstrust.ie/help-advice/advice-for-
owners/fireworks) .

##  Noise from homes

Domestic noise is noise from a domestic setting, like a home. Depending on the
cause of the noise, you will complain in a different way. This is outlined
below.

If the noise is coming from a person’s home, the Gardaí can ask them to lower
noise but they can’t enter the property with the sole intention of asking them
to lower the noise.

If the noise continues, you can complain to the District Court (see above).

There is useful information in the [ leaflet on neighbour disputes (pdf)
](http://www.flac.ie/download/pdf/neighbour_disputes.pdf) published by [ FLAC,
the Free Legal Advice Centres ](http://www.flac.ie/) .

###  **Noise from rented properties**

If there is noise coming from a rented home, you should approach the tenant
first and ask them to lower the noise. If this doesn’t work, you can complain
to the landlord. This may be a:

  * Private landlord 
  * Local authority 
  * Housing association 

People who are renting from private landlords or [ housing associations
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/housing/local-authority-and-social-
housing/approved-housing-bodies/) have certain [ obligations
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/housing/renting-a-home/tenants-rights-
and-responsibilities/tenants-rights-and-obligations/) . These include not
engaging in anti-social behaviour, which includes persistent noise that
affects others around them.

You can complain to the [ Residential Tenancies Board (RTB)
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/housing/renting-a-home/resolving-
disputes/residential-tenancies-board/) if a private landlord or housing
association doesn’t enforce these obligations.

If the tenant is renting from a local authority housing, they must avoid
causing any nuisance such as noise to other properties around you. If they do
make excessive and persistent noise, they are breaking the tenancy agreement
and the local authority can take steps to make sure they follow the terms of
the agreement. You can read the [ legislation on noise from rented properties
](https://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2009/act/22/enacted/en/html) .

###  **Noise from alarms**

All alarm installers must have licences from the [ Private Security Authority
](https://www.psa.gov.ie/) . To get a licence, they have to follow certain
standards. This includes a limit on the length of time an external alarm can
sound for – the maximum under the European standard is 15 minutes.

The local authority, the EPA or an individual may take action under the EPA
Act to deal with breaches of these standards.

You can read about car alarms in the [ Noise from transport
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/environment/environment-and-the-
law/noise-regulations/#774dad) section below.

###  **Noise from dogs**

If your neighbour’s dog is barking, you should go to your neighbour directly
to try resolve the issue. If this doesn’t work, you can complain to the
District Court.

You can do this by completing a Section 108 Form, which you can get from your
local authority or District Court. Before you do this, you must let the dog
owner know that you are making a complaint.

To deal with noise from a dog, the Court can:

  * Order the dog owner (or occupier of the house where the dog is kept) to exercise control over the dog to reduce the barking 
  * Limit the number of dogs that can be kept on a property 
  * Order that the dog warden takes the dog to the dog shelter 
  * Make the owner pay a fine for the noise and cost of taking and keeping the in the shelter. 

You can find out more about owning a dog on our page [ Dog licences and
ownership ](/en/environment/pets-and-wildlife/control-of-dogs/) .

###  **Noise from bird scarers (such as crow bangers)**

Bird scarers are used by farmers to keep birds away from their crops. They can
work by making a loud noise to scare away any birds or pests in the area.

Some bird scarers, such as crow bangers, can be extremely loud. There are no
laws in place to deal with bird scarers specifically.

If you want to complain about the noise from a crow banger, follow the steps
in the [ How to make a noise complaint
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/environment/environment-and-the-
law/noise-regulations/#dd9a0d) section above.

##  Noise from entertainment venues and events

Contact your local authority if you want to complain about noise coming from:

  * Bars 
  * Restaurants 
  * Nightclubs 
  * Concerts 
  * Other out-door events 

Your local authority may serve a notice to the organisers of the entertainment
to prevent or limit noise. Then if the organisers do not stop or limit the
noise, the local authority may prosecute them.

If you want to complain about noise from outside a premise or event, for
example, anti-social behaviour, you should contact An Garda Síochánna. The
Gardaí have the power to arrest a person for breach of the peace in a public
place.

##  Noise from transport

###  **Noise from motor vehicles**

All vehicles with an internal combustion engine must be fitted with a silencer
or a similar device to reduce the noise. This does not apply to vehicles
taking part in a trial, competition or race carried out on a closed road. Read
the [ laws on vehicle noise
](https://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1963/si/190/made/en/print) .

This does not apply to [ electric vehicles ](/en/travel-and-
recreation/motoring/buying-or-selling-a-vehicle/electric-vehicles/) , as they
don’t have an internal combustion engine; they have an electric engine.

You can’t drive a vehicle that causes excessive noise in a public place. The [
National Car Test ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/travel-and-
recreation/vehicle-standards/national-car-test/) (NCT) assess how effectively
the silencer reduces exhaust-related noise.

**Beeping a car horn**

You should only beep or use a horn to warn other road users of oncoming
danger, or to make them aware of your presence for safety reasons.

You shouldn’t use a horn in a built-up area between 11pm and 7am unless there
is a traffic emergency.

Contact the [ Gardaí ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/justice/law-
enforcement/garda-siochana-national-police-force/) if you wish to complain
about breaches of these rules.

**Car alarms**

No standards have been set in Ireland for the operation of car alarm noise.
The EU standards for car alarms set minimum and maximum time limits for the
sounding of the alarm (25 seconds minimum and 30 seconds maximum).

###  **Noise from aircrafts**

If you want to make a complaint about aeroplane noise, you can make it
directly to the airport in question. The [ Aircraft Noise Competent Authority
](https://www.fingal.ie/aircraftnoiseca) is responsible for managing noise
regulation at Dublin airport.

You can read more about [ making a noise complaint to Dublin Airport
](https://www.dublinairport.com/corporate/corporate-social-
responsibility/noise/complaints-procedure) .

The [ Irish Aviation Authority ](https://www.iaa.ie/) (IAA) is responsible for
controlling noise from aircraft.

[ Check the law
](https://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2019/act/12/enacted/en/print) on noise
from aircrafts in Dublin airport.

##  Commercial or industrial noise

If there is excessive noise coming from commercial or industrial works, you
may be able to make a complaint to the [ Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
](http://www.epa.ie/) or your local authority.

###  **Sites licenced by the EPA**

You can [ search for a licenced premise on the EPA website
](https://www.epa.ie/our-services/licensing/licencesearch/) . If the
commercial or industrial work site is licenced with the [ EPA
](http://www.epa.ie/) , they can take steps to make sure the site is following
the terms of a notice to control noise. The EPA can then recover the cost of
doing this.

The EPA can tell the person or body to take specific action to prevent or
limit noise. If those causing the noise don’t comply, they can be prosecuted.

The EPA usually deals with waste disposal activities and activities that
require [ Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control (IPPC)
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/environment/climate-change/pollution-
prevention-and-control/) licences.

###  **Sites not licenced with the EPA**

If the premise is not licenced with the EPA, you can report it to your local
authority.

Local authorities have similar powers to the EPA and can also serve notices.
This notice requires the person in charge to follow instructions set out in
the notice to prevent or limit noise.

The local authority can prosecute you if you fail to comply with the notice.

Or, it may take steps itself to ensure compliance and then recover the costs
from the person in charge.

###  **Noise from within your workplace**

If you want to make a complaint about noise at work, you should contact your
HR department first.

If this doesn’t work, you can [ contact the Health and Safety Authority (HSA)
](https://www.hsa.ie/eng/contact_us/hsa_contact_centre/) . The HAS deals with
queries regarding [ noise in the workplace
](http://www.hsa.ie/eng/Topics/Physical_Agents/Noise/) and it has [ FAQs on
this issue ](http://www.hsa.ie/eng/Topics/Physical_Agents/Noise/Noise_-
_Frequently_Asked_Questions/) .

You can read more in [ our page on health and safety at work
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/employment/employment-rights-and-
conditions/health-and-safety/health-safety-work/) .

##  Planning permission and noise complaints

When granting [ planning permission
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/housing/planning-permission/planning-
permission/) for a building, the local authority can include conditions to
prevent or reduce noise. These conditions can relate to the construction or
building phase and/or to the use of the building when it is complete.

You can appeal to [ An Bord Pleanála
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/housing/planning-permission/an-bord-
pleanala/) against these requirements (or the absence of them).

##  Further information and contacts

Contact [ your local authority ](https://www.housing.gov.ie/local-
government/administration/local-authorities/local-authorities) for more
information on noise complaints.

Contact your [ local Garda station ](https://www.garda.ie/en/contact-
us/station-directory/) .
