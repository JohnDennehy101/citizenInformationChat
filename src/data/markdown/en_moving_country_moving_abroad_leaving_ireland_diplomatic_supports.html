#  Diplomatic supports for Irish people abroad

  * Introduction 
  * Help available 
  * Contacts 

##  Introduction

The Department of Foreign Affairs offers [ consular assistance
](https://www.ireland.ie/en/dfa/overseas-travel/assistance-abroad/consular-
assistance-charter/) to Irish citizens abroad. If you need help while you are
abroad, you can contact the [ Irish embassy or consulate
](https://www.ireland.ie/en/dfa/embassies/) in that country.

If you are in a country where there is no embassy or consulate, you can
contact embassies or consulates of other European Union countries for
assistance.

##  Help available

Embassies and consulates can be of assistance if:

  * You need an [ emergency passport ](https://www.dfa.ie/travel/assistance-abroad/lost-or-stolen-passport-abroad/)
  * You have been the [ victim of crime ](https://www.ireland.ie/en/dfa/overseas-travel/assistance-abroad/victim-of-crime/) or illness or have had a serious accident 
  * You have been [ arrested or imprisoned ](https://www.ireland.ie/en/dfa/overseas-travel/assistance-abroad/arrest-detention/) while abroad 
  * You are facing [ deportation ](https://www.ireland.ie/en/dfa/overseas-travel/assistance-abroad/deportation/)
  * You need help in transferring funds from home 
  * A family member or friend is [ missing abroad ](https://www.ireland.ie/en/dfa/overseas-travel/assistance-abroad/missing-person-abroad/)
  * There is a [ death abroad ](https://www.ireland.ie/en/dfa/overseas-travel/assistance-abroad/death-abroad/) and the remains need to be returned to Ireland. 

There is a limit to what the embassy or consulate can do. For example, if you
have been [ ill or in an accident ](https://www.ireland.ie/en/dfa/overseas-
travel/assistance-abroad/sick-or-injured/) , they can:

  * Contact your family or friends in Ireland 
  * Help you find English-speaking doctors, translators, and medical services 
  * Liaise with local medical services on your behalf 
  * Transfer funds from family and friends to you. 

However, they cannot pay your medical bills or other medical expenses. They
also cannot get involved in commercial or legal disputes, give legal advice or
pay your legal bills.

Further information about the [ range of services relating to the consular
protection of Irish citizens ](https://www.ireland.ie/en/dfa/overseas-
travel/assistance-abroad/) is available from the Consular Section of the
Department of Foreign Affairs – see 'Where to apply' below.
