##  Introduction

Ireland is a _constitutional republic_ , which means that the fundamental
rules that determine how the State behaves, how laws are made, and how power
should be used are set out in a written constitution.

It also means that the people of Ireland elect who they want to represent
them, govern them, and make laws on their behalf.

The [ Irish Constitution ](/en/government-in-ireland/irish-
constitution-1/constitution-introduction/) establishes and describes the main
institutions of the State. The power to run the State is divided into 3
separate branches:

  * The _Legislature_ (or _legislative branch_ ) 
  * The _Executive_ (or _executive branch_ ) 
  * The _Judiciary_ (or _judicial branch_ ) 

The Constitution tries to keep these powers separate to guarantee that there
is not too much power in the hands of one institution of the State.

##  Separation of powers

The Irish Constitution says that all of the power of the State comes from the
Irish people.

It also says that that the power to govern is divided between the Legislature,
the Executive and the Judiciary.

The Legislature has law-making power. Only the [ Oireachtas
](https://www.oireachtas.ie/) (the national parliament), with the [ President
](/en/government-in-ireland/houses-of-the-oireachtas/president-introduction-
to-the-president-of-ireland/) as its head, can make laws in Ireland. See ‘The
Legislature' below.

The Executive has the power to enforce the law, run the departments of the
State and set the agenda of the Oireachtas. The [ Government ](/en/government-
in-ireland/how-government-works/national-government/government-of-ireland/) ,
led by the Taoiseach, has the executive power of the State. See ‘The
Executive’ below.

The Judiciary has the power to interpret the law. The Irish [ courts system
](http://www.courts.ie/) has this power, which includes the power to decide if
a piece of legislation or law is _unconstitutional_ . See ‘The Judiciary’
below.

The Constitution sets out how these state powers should work, and puts in
place checks and balances to prevent institutions from having too much power.

##  The Legislature

The legislative power is the power to make laws. The Oireachtas does this
through introducing and changing [ legislation ](/en/government-in-
ireland/houses-of-the-oireachtas/legislation/) . Articles [ 15 to 27
](https://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/cons/en/html#part4) of the Constitution
give this power to the national parliament or the Oireachtas. The Oireachtas
comprises:

  * The [ Dáil ](/en/government-in-ireland/houses-of-the-oireachtas/dail-eireann/)
  * The [ Seanad ](/en/government-in-ireland/houses-of-the-oireachtas/the-seanad/)
  * The [ President ](/en/government-in-ireland/houses-of-the-oireachtas/president-introduction-to-the-president-of-ireland/)

The main function of the Oireachtas is to make new laws and amend existing
laws. New laws start as Bills, and must be debated by the Dáil and Seanad and
passed by both Houses before the President can sign the bill into law. If the
Seanad does not pass a bill, the Dáil can still enter the bill into law, but
must pass a resolution declaring that the Bill is deemed to have been passed
by both Houses. When a bill becomes law, it is known as an [ Act of the
Oireachtas ](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/acts.html) .

Any sitting TD ( _Teachta Dála_ , the name given to elected members of the
Dáil) or Senator can publish a Bill and try to have it passed by the House,
but the Bill must have the Government’s support if it involves spending public
money _._

The President has the power to refer a bill to the [ Supreme Court
](/en/justice/courts-system/supreme-court/) to seek a judgment that the law is
constitutional.

TDs are elected in [ general elections ](/en/government-in-ireland/elections-
and-referenda/types-of-elections-and-referendums/the-general-election/) ,
which must be held at least every 5 years. Senators are either appointed by
the Taoiseach, or elected in Seanad elections, which take place after a
general election has been held.

The Oireachtas also elects the Government and passes budgets for Government
Departments.

##  The Executive

[ Article 28 ](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/cons/en/html#part5) of the
Constitution gives executive power to [ the Government ](/en/government-in-
ireland/how-government-works/national-government/government-of-ireland/) .

Executive power includes the power to execute or carry out laws with the
assistance of the [ civil service ](/en/government-in-ireland/how-government-
works/national-government/the-civil-service/) , police force and military. The
head of Government is the Taoiseach, who is nominated by the [ Dáil
](/en/government-in-ireland/houses-of-the-oireachtas/dail-eireann/) . The
Taoiseach nominates a deputy (the Tánaiste) and a cabinet of ministers to take
responsibility for the [ Departments of Government ](/en/government-in-
ireland/how-government-works/national-government/departments-of-state/) .

The Government is usually formed by the largest party in the Dáil after a [
general election ](/en/government-in-ireland/elections-and-referenda/types-of-
elections-and-referendums/the-general-election/) . A Government formed from
two or more parties is called a [ coalition government ](/en/government-in-
ireland/how-government-works/national-government/government-of-ireland/) .

The Government must have at least 7 members (which must include the Taoiseach,
the Tánaiste and the Minister for Finance), and at most 15 members. A maximum
of 2 senators can be appointed as Ministers.

The Government is answerable to [ Dáil Éireann ](/en/government-in-
ireland/houses-of-the-oireachtas/dail-eireann/) , and will not survive without
the support of the majority of TDs.

##  The Judiciary

The judicial power is the power to interpret and apply the law to disputes and
conflicts that arise between the State and the individual and disputes and
conflicts that arise between individuals. Articles [ 34 to 37
](https://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/cons/en/html#part11) of the Constitution
give this power to the [ courts ](/en/justice/courts-system/courts/) .

Under [ Article 35 ](https://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/cons/en/html#part11)
, judges of the courts are independent of the Government and can only be
removed through a resolution of both houses of the Oireachtas for misbehaviour
or incapacity.

Judges are appointed by the [ President ](/en/government-in-ireland/houses-of-
the-oireachtas/president-introduction-to-the-president-of-ireland/) , who acts
on the advice of the Government. The [ Judicial Appointments Advisory Board
](http://www.jaab.ie/) advises the Government on suitable candidates for the
bench.
