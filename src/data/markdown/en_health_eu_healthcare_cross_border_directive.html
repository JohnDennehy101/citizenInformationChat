#  Cross-Border Healthcare Directive

  * Introduction 
  * UK and Northern Ireland 
  * Rules 
  * How to apply 
  * Where to apply 

##  Introduction

If you are entitled to public health services in Ireland, you may choose to
access those services in another member state of the [ European Union (EU)
](/en/government-in-ireland/european-government/european-union/european-
union/) or European Economic Area (EEA), which also includes Iceland,
Liechtenstein and Norway, and be repaid the cost if you meet the requirements.
This is provided for by the Cross-Border Healthcare Directive ( [ EU Directive
2011/24/EU, pdf ](http://eur-
lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2011:088:0045:0065:en:PDF) ).

You will be repaid the cost of the public healthcare treatment in Ireland, or
the cost of your treatment abroad, if that is less. It does not include other
costs such as travel.

Treatments that qualify for the [ Treatment Abroad Scheme ](/en/health/eu-
healthcare/treatment-abroad-scheme/) are not covered under the Cross-Border
Healthcare Directive. The Treatment Abroad Scheme covers treatments that are
not available in Ireland while the Cross-Border Healthcare Directive only
covers treatments that are publicly funded and available in Ireland. [ Read
about the differences between the two schemes ](/en/health/eu-
healthcare/travelling-for-healthcare/) .

##  UK and Northern Ireland

You can no longer use the Cross-Border Healthcare Directive to access
healthcare in the UK.

The [ Northern Ireland Planned Healthcare Scheme
](https://www2.hse.ie/services/schemes-allowances/niphs/) is a temporary
scheme that allows you to receive healthcare in Northern Ireland in a similar
way to the Cross-Border Healthcare Directive. The healthcare must be publicly
available in Ireland. You must pay for the healthcare and then claim the cost
from the HSE.

The Scheme is available until a permanent statutory scheme is approved.
Residents of Northern Ireland can access healthcare in Ireland under the [
Republic of Ireland Reimbursement Scheme
](http://www.hscboard.hscni.net/travelfortreatment/roi-reimbursement/) .

If you have started your healthcare in the UK and began to receive that
healthcare before 2021, you may still be able to apply for [ reimbursement
under the Cross- Border Healthcare Directive
](https://www2.hse.ie/services/cross-border-directive/apply-for-cross-border-
directive-repayment.html#UK) .

##  Rules

Funding will only be reimbursed for healthcare that is publicly funded and
available in Ireland but the referral may be to a public or private health
service in the other country. You pay the costs of treatment and then apply
for a refund when you return to Ireland.

Examples of healthcare that is available under the scheme include:

  * Day, in-patient and out-patient care in acute hospital services, including psychiatric services 
  * Community-based out-patient care 
  * Dental and orthodontic services (with some exceptions, such as dental screening services in schools) 
  * Speech and language services 
  * Occupational therapy services (with some exceptions, such as assessment for aids at home) 
  * Psychology services 
  * Physiotherapy services 
  * Disability services 
  * Ophthalmic services 
  * Mental health services 
  * Methadone programme 
  * Addiction care 

Some health services are not included, for example, organ transplantation and
long-term care such as nursing home care.

The HSE has provided a list of [ Frequently Asked Questions
](http://www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/1/schemes/cbd/faqs/) about the Cross-
Border Healthcare Directive.

##  How to apply

To use health services in another country and be refunded under the Cross-
Border Healthcare Directive you must:

  * Be referred to the health service abroad 
  * Get prior authorisation if it is required for your treatment 
  * Apply for a refund of your costs 

###  Referral to healthcare abroad

In the same way that you would be referred to public health services in
Ireland, you must be referred to the health service you require abroad. This
may be, for example, by your GP (family doctor) or public hospital consultant.
In the case of some community-based services the appropriate referral could be
by a Health Service Executive (HSE) professional such as a public health
nurse, community dentist or HSE orthodontist.

The referral letter should specify the healthcare required, the health
professional abroad you are being referred to and their clinic, hospital or
other location. You, or the person referring you, should be satisfied that the
healthcare provider abroad is qualified and suitable. If you wish to access
information on services or service providers abroad please contact the [
National Contact Point for the other EU/EEA State.
](https://europa.eu/youreurope/citizens/health/planned-healthcare/get-more-
info/index_en.htm)

Make sure that the service you are seeking to access abroad is covered by the
Cross-Border Healthcare Directive. Your referring clinician can advise you
about this but if you are in doubt you can contact the [ National Contact
Point in Ireland ](http://www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/1/schemes/cbd/contact/)
to check.

###  Prior authorisation

If the treatment involves an overnight stay in hospital then it will need to
be authorised in advance by the HSE. For other treatment it is advisable to
check whether prior authorisation is required by contacting the National
Contact Point.

The [ application form for prior authorisation (pdf)
](http://www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/1/schemes/cbd/appreimbursement/HSE_CBD_Application_for_Prior_Authorisation_.pdf)
must be completed by you and by the medical professional who is referring you
for treatment abroad. Completed applications take 15 to 20 working days to
process and you will be notified of the decision by letter.

Prior authorisation is also required for healthcare that involves:

  * Highly specialised and cost-intensive medical infrastructure or equipment 
  * Treatments presenting a particular risk for the patient or the population 
  * A healthcare provider that could give rise to serious and specific concerns relating to the quality or safety of the care 

###  Applying for a refund of costs

To get a refund of the costs that you pay for your treatment, you and your
healthcare provider abroad must complete the [ HSE Cross-Border Healthcare
Directive Pro-Forma Invoice (pdf)
](http://www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/1/schemes/cbd/appreimbursement/HSE_Cross_Border_Directive_Pro-
Forma_Invoice.pdf) and submit it with the invoice from the healthcare provider
and receipt.

The refund will only be made to the patient (or to the parents of a child
patient).

The HSE has published the [ refund amounts for different treatments
](https://www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/1/schemes/cross-border-
directive/appreimbursement/) . Treatments are listed according to a code – you
can get the code for your treatment from the healthcare professional who has
referred you. If you prefer, or if your treatment is not listed, you can get
details of the refund rates from the [ National Contact Point
](http://www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/1/schemes/cbd/contact/) .

The maximum refund for a hospital outpatient consultation is €130. If you have
more than one consultation on the same day with consultants in the same
speciality, the daily limit is €130.

For in-patient treatment, the [ charges for public in-patients in public
hospitals in Ireland ](/en/health/health-services/gp-and-hospital-
services/hospital-charges/) will apply. These charges will be deducted from
the amount of the refund.

###  Appeals

If your application is refused you can appeal to the Assistant National
Director of the Contracts Department of the HSE – contact the [ National
Contact Point ](http://www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/1/schemes/cbd/contact/) .
