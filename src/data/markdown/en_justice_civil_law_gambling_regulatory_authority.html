##  Introduction

The [ Gambling Regulatory Authority of Ireland (GRAI)
](https://www.gov.ie/en/campaigns/5693a-gambling-regulatory-authority-of-
ireland/) is a new statutory body that will be responsible for the licensing
and regulation of gambling services in Ireland. The GRAI will be independent
in the performance of its functions.

The GRAI has not been established yet. The new regulator will focus on public
safety and wellbeing, will cover gambling online and in person, and will have
powers to regulate advertising, gambling, websites, and apps.

Licensing and regulation of gambling in Ireland is currently based on several
pieces of legislation. The new legislation, which will establish the GRAI,
will repeal existing laws and will streamline the approach to licensing and
regulation of gambling in Ireland.

The National Lottery will not be covered by the new legislation and will
remain separately regulated.

##  Members of the GRAI

The GRAI will comprise seven members, including an appointed Chairperson, with
relevant experience in related matters, including:

  * Legal or compliance in a regulated setting 
  * Gambling activities 
  * Consumer affairs 
  * The pathology and treatment of addiction, particularly gambling addiction 
  * Information and communications technology 
  * Financial services, including audit and forensic accounting practice 

The members will comprise no fewer than 3 men and no fewer than 3 women. The
members will be appointed by the Minister for Justice following a competition
held by the Public Appointments Service.

##  Functions of the GRAI

The GRAI will have a wide variety of functions, including:

  * Regulating the provision of gambling services and activities, both online and in person 
  * Developing safeguards to protect consumers from problem gambling, [ particularly to protect children ](https://www.gov.ie/en/organisation-information/fd193-information-for-licensees/#safeguards-and-protections) from accessing places or services where gambling activities are offered 
  * Establishing both a [ National Gambling Exclusion Register ](https://www.gov.ie/en/organisation-information/2ceb2-information-for-the-public/#the-national-gambling-exclusion-register) and a [ Social Impact Fund ](https://www.gov.ie/en/organisation-information/2ceb2-information-for-the-public/#social-impact-fund) to finance research, training, and education on gambling addiction 
  * [ Licensing of gambling services and activities ](https://www.gov.ie/en/organisation-information/fd193-information-for-licensees/) , including maintaining a register of all licensed operators and determining license fees 
  * Ensuring compliance by gambling providers with restrictions imposed on [ advertising ](https://www.gov.ie/en/organisation-information/2ceb2-information-for-the-public/#advertising) and [ sponsorship ](https://www.gov.ie/en/organisation-information/2ceb2-information-for-the-public/#sponsorship-and-inducements) , including a statutory watershed prohibiting gambling advertising between the hours of 5.30am and 9.00pm on television, radio or on-demand audio-visual media 
  * Receiving, investigating and addressing complaints about gambling providers 
  * Ensuring compliance by gambling providers with the Criminal Justice (Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing) Act 2010, and addressing [ money laundering ](/en/money-and-tax/personal-finance/banking/money-laundering-in-ireland/) activities in the context of gambling services 
  * Keeping the Minister of Justice informed of developments relating to the regulation and licensing of gambling services and making recommendations on policies 
  * Promoting public awareness and providing information to the public about regulation and licensing of gambling activities 

###  Types of gambling licenses

The GRAI will oversee the introduction of 3 types of licenses for both in-
person and online or remote betting:

  1. Business to Consumer Gaming, Betting and Lottery Licenses 
  2. Business to Business Licences 
  3. Gambling licenses for Charitable/Philanthropic Causes 

You can read more about the [ statutory powers of the GRAI
](https://www.gov.ie/en/organisation-information/e240d-powers-of-the-gambling-
regulatory-authority/) .

##  When will the GRAI be established?

###  The Gambling Regulation Bill 2022

The [ Gambling Regulation Bill 2022 (pdf)
](https://data.oireachtas.ie/ie/oireachtas/bill/2022/114/eng/initiated/b11422d.pdf)
is a draft of the proposed new law which will establish the GRAI. This was
published in December 2022. The Bill is progressing through the different [
stages of legislation ](/en/government-in-ireland/houses-of-the-
oireachtas/legislation#l11326) necessary to become law. You can see the
progress of the Bill on the [ House of Oireachtas website
](https://www.oireachtas.ie/en/bills/bill/2022/114/) .

The Department of Justice has established a Programme Board to ensure
legislation and operational preparations are progressed at the same time so
that, once the Bill becomes law, the GRAI can commence operations as soon as
possible.

It is expected that the GRAI will be established and operational in 2024. You
can [ read more about the GRAI
](https://www.gov.ie/en/campaigns/5693a-gambling-regulatory-authority-of-
ireland/) on its website.

##  Help for problem gambling

There are [ addiction treatment services ](/en/health/health-services/alcohol-
and-drug-treatment-services/alcohol-addiction-services/) available with
different options depending on your needs.

The Department of Justice has also [ published
](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/52611-gambling-regulatory-authority-of-
ireland/#help-for-problem-gambling) a list of contact details for external [
Problem Gambling Support Services (pdf)
](https://www.gov.ie/pdf/?file=https://assets.gov.ie/233859/b7ac3cb9-8c15-4f90-923d-a9937071e233.pdf#page=null)
