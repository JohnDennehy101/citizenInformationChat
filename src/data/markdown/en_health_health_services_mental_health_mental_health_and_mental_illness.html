##  Introduction

If you have a mental illness, your entitlement to care and treatment is the
same as if you are suffering from another illness. You have the same [
entitlement to general health services ](/en/health/health-system/entitlement-
to-public-health-services/) and to [ community care services
](/en/health/health-services/care-in-your-community/) .

The Health Service Executive (HSE) has further information including:

  * Advice on [ how to help your mental health during difficult life situations ](https://www2.hse.ie/mental-health/life-situations-events/)
  * A list of different [ mental health supports and services ](https://www2.hse.ie/mental-health/life-situations-events/)
  * How to [ get help for your mental health ](https://www2.hse.ie/mental-health/services-support/)
  * [ Supporting somebody experiencing mental health problems ](https://www2.hse.ie/mental-health/helping-someone-else/)

##  Mental Health Commission

The [ Mental Health Commission ](/en/health/health-services/mental-
health/mental-health-commission/) has overall responsibility for:

  * The standards and practices of mental health services 
  * Regulating in-patient mental health services 
  * Protecting the interests of people who are involuntarily admitted. 

The [ Inspector of Mental Health Services
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/health/health-services/mental-
health/inspector-of-mental-health-services/) carries out inspections of mental
health facilities.

##  Mental health care in Ireland

####  **Care in the community**

The overall aim of mental health services is to ensure that you can get care
for mental health issues while continuing in society or within the community.

There are specific [ mental health professionals
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/health/health-services/mental-
health/mental-health-professionals/) who specialise in the provision of [
mental health services ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/health/health-
services/mental-health/mental-health-services/) .

####  **In-patient mental health services**

You can access in-patient services for mental illness in approved psychiatric
centres. These are mainly psychiatric hospitals and psychiatric units in
general hospitals.

####  Admission to mental health services and your rights

You can check the rules about [ admission to psychiatric hospitals
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/health/health-services/mental-
health/admission-to-a-psychiatric-hospital/) which are set out in the [ Mental
Health Act 2001 ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/health/health-
services/mental-health/mental-health-act-2001/) .

You can read about the [ rights of psychiatric patients
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/health/health-services/mental-
health/rights-of-psychiatric-patients/) .

##  Further information

The Mental Health Commission provides [ information for mental health patients
](https://www.mhcirl.ie/what-we-do/mental-health-tribunals/information-
patients) and their families.
