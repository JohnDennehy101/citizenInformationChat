#  Classification of crimes in criminal cases

  * Introduction 
  * Summary and indictable offences 
  * Minor and non-minor offences 
  * Serious and non-serious offences 
  * Arrestable and non-arrestable offences 

##  Introduction

A crime is defined as an act which can be punished by the State. The way a
criminal offence is investigated and prosecuted depends on the type of crime.
Criminal offences can be:

  * Summary offences 
  * Indictable offences 
  * Minor offences 
  * Serious offences 
  * Arrestable offences 

##  Summary and indictable offences

In Irish law [ criminal offences can be tried ](/en/justice/criminal-
law/criminal-trial/criminal-trial/) in two ways:

  * In the lower court ( [ District Court ](/en/justice/courts-system/district-court/) ) in front of a [ judge ](/en/justice/courtroom/judge/) without a [ jury ](/en/justice/courtroom/jury/)
  * In the higher courts ( [ Circuit Criminal Court ](/en/justice/courts-system/circuit-court/) , [ Central Criminal Court ](/en/justice/courts-system/high-court/) ) in front of a judge and jury 

A summary offence is an offence which can only be dealt with by a judge
sitting without a jury in the District Court. While offences which can or must
be tried before a judge and jury are called indictable offences.

All common-law offences are indictable offences as the common law did not
distinguish between indictable and non-indictable offences. However, criminal
statutes or criminal laws that have been passed into law do differentiate
between types of crimes and how they will be dealt with by the courts.

When the District Court deals with an offence, the judge can only impose a
certain length of sentence for an offence. The [ Criminal Justice Act 1984
(Section11)
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1984/en/act/pub/0022/sec0011.html#zza22y1984s11)
states that the District Court can impose a maximum sentence of 2 years
imprisonment when it is sentencing for a number of offences at the same time.
Similarly, the District Court cannot exceed a [ maximum sentence of 1 year for
1 offence ](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1951/en/act/pub/0002/sec0004.html)
.

Examples of summary offences include the following public order offences:

  * Begging in an intimidating or threatening manner. The penalty for being found guilty of this offence is a [ class E fine ](/en/justice/criminal-law/criminal-trial/fines-for-criminal-offences/) or up to one month in prison or both a fine and a term of imprisonment. 
  * Threatening abusive or insulting behaviour in a public place. The penalty for a person found guilty of this offence is a class D fine or up to 3 months in prison or both a fine and a term of imprisonment. 

###  Are all indictable offences tried in the higher courts?

Indictable offences are serious charges which can or must be tried before a
judge and jury in the Circuit Court or the Central Criminal Court. However,
not all indictable offences are tried before a jury. Indictable offences can
be divided into the following 3 categories:

  * Offences which must always be tried on indictment in front of a judge and jury 
  * Offences which can be tried summarily or by indictment at the request of the Director of Public Prosecutions, the judge or the accused 
  * Offences which can be tried either summarily or on indictment at the request of the Director of Public Prosecutions, as long as the District Court judge agrees 

**Offences which must always be tried on indictment in front of a judge and
jury**

There are a number of offences which must be tried before a judge and jury and
these offences are listed in the [ Criminal Procedure Act 1967
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1967/en/act/pub/0012/index.html) and the [
Criminal Law (Rape) (Amendment) Act 1990
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1990/en/act/pub/0032/index.html) . These
include:

  * Offences under the [ Treason Act 1939 ](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1939/en/act/pub/0010/index.html)
  * Murder, attempted murder, conspiracy to murder 
  * Piracy 
  * Rape 
  * Aggravated sexual assault 

There are also a number of other offences which cannot be dealt with in the
District Court (summary disposal) and must be dealt with on indictment, for
example:

  * Assault causing serious harm. The penalty on conviction for this offence is a fine or imprisonment for life or both. The [ statute (or piece of law) ](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1997/en/act/pub/0026/sec0004.html#zza26y1997s4) for this offence does not allow for this offence to be dealt with summarily. 
  * Riot. The [ piece of law ](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1994/en/act/pub/0002/sec0014.html#zza2y1994s14) covering this offence states that it can only be dealt with on indictment. 

**Offences which can be tried summarily or by indictment at the request of the
Director of Public Prosecutions, the judge or the accused**

[ Certain offences
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1951/act/2/schedule/1/enacted/en/html#sched1)
can be dealt with in the District Court if the following 3 conditions are met:

  1. The court is of the opinion that the facts proved or alleged constitute a minor offence fit to be tried summarily (in the District Court) 
  2. The accused person does not object to being tried in the District Court, even when told of their right to be tried by a judge and a jury 
  3. The [ Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) ](http://www.dppireland.ie/) consents to the accused being tried summarily for the offence 

In practice, the judge looks to see what the DPP has directed and then asks
the prosecuting Garda for an outline of the facts of the case. The judge then
decides whether or not they are willing to hear the case or send it forward to
a higher court to be dealt with. If the judge decides to hear the case in the
District Court, the accused is allowed choose if they want to be dealt with in
the District Court or the Circuit Court. Normally, if an accused is given this
choice they ask to be dealt with in the District Court, as the maximum penalty
in the District Court is less than that available in the Circuit Court.

Examples of some of the offences that can be dealt in this way are:

  * Offences under Section 7(2) and Section 8 of the [ Criminal Law Act 1997 ](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1997/en/act/pub/0014/index.html)
  * Offences under the [ Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act 2001 ](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2001/act/50/enacted/en/html)

**Offences which can be tried either summarily or on indictment at the request
of the Director of Public Prosecutions, subject to the agreement of the
District Court judge**

Certain offences can be dealt with in the District Court if the following 2
conditions are met:

  1. The court is of the opinion that the facts proved or alleged constitute a minor offence fit to be tried summarily (in the District Court) 
  2. The [ Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) ](https://www.dppireland.ie/) consents to the accused being tried summarily for the offence 

The offences in this category are created by statute (piece of law), and the
statute outlines the different punishments for the offences on summary
conviction and on indictment. Examples of these offences include:

  * Assault causing harm under Section 3 of the [ Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act 1997 ](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1997/act/26/enacted/en/html)
  * Reckless discharge of a firearm under Section 8 of the F [ irearms and Offensive Weapons Act 1990 ](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1990/act/12/enacted/en/html)

In practice, the DPP issues instructions stating whether the offence should be
dealt with in the District or Circuit Court. If the DPP directs summary
disposal (District Court), the District Court judge hears a summary of the
facts from the prosecuting Garda and then decides if they will allow the case
to be dealt with in their court. If the judge is not satisfied that the
offence is a minor offence they can refuse to deal with the case and send it
forward to the Circuit Court to be dealt with on indictment.

##  Minor and non-minor offences

Under Article 38.2 of the [ Constitution of Ireland ](/en/government-in-
ireland/irish-constitution-1/constitution-introduction/) minor offences can be
tried in courts of summary jurisdiction, that is, the District Court. The
Constitution does not define what a minor offence is, although minor offences
are often set down by the actual law. Minor and non-minor offences equate more
or less with the statutory distinction drawn between summary and indictable
offences.

The Supreme Court has however considered the issue of what constitutes a minor
offence. The most important case in this area is a case called _Melling v Ó
Mathghamhna [1962] IR 1_ . In examining the criteria or rules when deciding
whether an offence was minor the Supreme Court laid out the following test:

  * The severity or seriousness of the punishment 
  * Moral guilt of the accused 
  * The law in 1937 when the Constitution was adopted, and 
  * Public opinion 

Of these four tests, the most important one is the severity or seriousness of
the sentence.

All that can be said with certainty is that an offence is minor where the
punishment is less than six months imprisonment ( _Conroy v Attorney General
[1965] IR 411_ ), whereas an offence is non-minor where the punishment is two
years or more ( _Mallon v Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry [1996] 1
IR 517_ ). It appears, however, that the courts have come to the belief that
an offence with a maximum prison sentence of twelve months constitutes a minor
offence. It can be said as a result that any offence that carries a penalty of
more than twelve months imprisonment is considered a non-minor offence.

##  Serious and non-serious offences

The [ Bail Act 1997
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1997/en/act/pub/0016/index.html) created a
new distinction between serious and non-serious offences. It states that bail
can be refused where an accused is charged with a serious offence and it can
be established that they are likely to commit further serious offences if
released on bail. The Bail Act 1997 defines a serious offence as an offence
that you could be punished by imprisonment for 5 years or more, if you are
convicted.

##  Arrestable and non-arrestable offences

The [ Criminal Law Act 1997
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1997/en/act/pub/0014/index.html) defines an
arrestable offence as an offence that you could be punished by imprisonment
for 5 years or more, similar to the definition of a serious offence mentioned
above.

This distinction holds great importance for the Gardaí. [ Section 4 of the
Criminal Law Act 1997
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1997/en/act/pub/0014/sec0004.html#zza14y1997s4)
allows a Garda to arrest anyone that they have reasonable cause to believe is
guilty of committing an arrestable offence. They can do this without a
warrant.

Anyone arrested for an arrestable offence without a warrant can be detained in
a Garda station for up to 24 hours for questioning, before being charged or
released. In certain circumstances if you remain silent when questioned by
Gardaí, assumptions can be drawn from your silence in any proceedings against
you for an arrestable offence. [ Further information on your right to silence
is available here ](/en/justice/arrests/right-to-silence-in-criminal-cases/) .
