WELCOME TO SUSI

###  Applying for a grant? Find all the information you need right here.

[ How to Apply  ](/how-to-apply/)

##  How SUSI Works

With SUSI, you can quickly and easily work out where you stand when it comes
to your grant application and what you need to do next. It’s as easy as 1, 2
and 3.

[ Start An Application  ](https://grantsonline.ie/auth/esr.elogin)

  1. ###  Get an indication of your eligibility 

If you are unsure about your eligibility, then check out our Eligibility
Indicator first. Answer a series of questions to get an indication of your
eligibility for a student grant.

  2. ###  Submit your application 

Once the Eligibility Indicator suggests that you might be eligible for a
student grant, you can then begin your application. First, register an account
in the SUSI student portal and then complete the application form and submit
it to SUSI for assessment. Starting the application process is simple but make
sure you have all information about your circumstances beforehand.

  3. ###  Receive your decision 

Following assessment, you will either receive a letter detailing the outcome
of your application or a checklist letter requesting documents to support your
application. And remember, you can track the progress of your application in
your SUSI student portal.
