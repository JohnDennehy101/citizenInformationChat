##  Your consumer rights

When you buy a new car from a garage or car dealer, you are entering into a
consumer contract. You have the same consumer rights as when you [ buy any
other products ](/en/consumer/shopping/rights-when-buying-in-a-shop/) from a
business.

You can expect the car to meet certain conditions of quality and durability
and match what was set out in the contract. You are entitled to certain
_remedies_ if something goes wrong after you buy. Remedies could be a repair,
replacement, refund or price reduction. Read more about [ your consumer rights
](/en/consumer/consumer-laws/your-consumer-rights/) and [ problems with faulty
goods ](/en/consumer/shopping/problems-with-faulty-goods/) .

Consumer rights only apply to deals between a _consumer_ (a person who buys
something for personal use or consumption) and a _trader_ (a person who sells
goods or services as part of their trade, business or profession).

##  Using car finance

There are different car finance options available if you need to get a loan to
pay for your new car.

###  Personal loan

Many banks, building societies and credit unions offer car loans. You borrow
the money and own the car immediately. You pay back the money in monthly
instalments and usually pay fees and [ interest ](/en/money-and-tax/personal-
finance/savings-and-investments/comparing-interest-on-savings-and-
investments#l9e60a) to the lender.

###  Hire purchase (HP) agreements

HP is a type of credit that is often offered by garages and car dealers. Under
HP, you rent the car, and pay the cost in regular instalments to your lender
(who is usually a bank, a building society or finance companies). You can use
the car but cannot sell it without the lender’s permission. The lender owns
the car until you make the final payment. Read more about [ hire purchase
](/en/money-and-tax/personal-finance/loans-and-credit/hire-purchase/) .

###  Personal Contract Plans (PCPs)

A PCP is similar to a HP agreement. You pay regular instalments and do not own
the car until you have made the final payment. The main difference is that you
pay lower monthly instalments but owe more money at the end of the PCP
agreement. The Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC) has [
more information about PCPs
](https://www.ccpc.ie/consumers/money/loans/paying-for-your-car/pcp/) .

###  Shop around for the best deal

You should always shop around, compare prices and make sure you know what you
are agreeing to before signing a car finance contract. If a garage or car
dealer is offering to arrange finance, they are acting as an agent (or a
_credit intermediary_ ) for a finance company and will earn commission for
arranging the loan. Agents must be authorised by the CCPC. The CCPC keeps a [
register of credit intermediaries ](https://www.ccpc.ie/business/credit-
intermediaries/authorised-credit-intermediaries/) .

The CCPC has more information about [ paying for your car
](https://www.ccpc.ie/consumers/cars/paying-for-your-car/) and what you can do
if you have problems making the payments for [ HP or PCP agreements
](https://www.ccpc.ie/consumers/money/debt/problems-making-car-repayments/) .

##  Electric vehicle grants

You may be able to get a grant from the Sustainable Energy Authority Ireland
(SEAI) if you buy a battery-powered electric vehicle (BEV) that meets specific
standards.

Since 1 July 2023, you can get a grant of up to €3,500 for battery-powered
electric vehicles (BEV). (Previously, the grant was €5,000).

The grant for BEVs **only applies to cars with a full price of between €14,000
and €60,000** .

Your car dealer will apply for the grant for you, and then deduct the grant
amount from the total price of your car.

Since 1 January 2022, the grant of €2,500 for plug-in hybrid electric vehicles
(PHEV) has been removed.

Read more about [ electric vehicles
](https://www.seai.ie/technologies/electric-vehicles/) and [ grants for
electric vehicles ](https://www.seai.ie/grants/electric-vehicle-grants/) on
the SEAI website. You can also read about [ other financial supports for
owners of electric vehicles ](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/fabfa-
electric-vehicles/#supports-available) , such as toll reductions and Vehicle
Registration Tax (VRT) relief.

###  Home charging grants

You can also apply for the [ Home Charger Grant Scheme
](https://www.seai.ie/grants/electric-vehicle-grants/electric-vehicle-home-
charger-grant/) , for up to €300 towards the installation costs of a home
charger.

##  Trade-ins

If you are replacing your old car, trading it in can help to bring down the
cost of a new one. You should shop around and see what different garages or
car dealerships will offer for your old car as a trade-in.

Find out what your car is worth before taking it to a dealer. You can get
independent expert advice on this from a qualified mechanic or by doing your
own research online on [ motorcheck.ie ](https://www.motorcheck.ie/faqs/what-
is-the-value-of-the-car/) . Note that a garage or car dealer is likely to pay
less for it than if you sell it yourself. The CCPC has more tips about [
trade-ins ](https://www.ccpc.ie/consumers/cars/before-you-buy-car/) .

##  Registration and Vehicle Registration Tax (VRT)

When you buy a car in Ireland, or import it, you must meet a number of legal
requirements.

For example, all new vehicles, except those brought in temporarily by
visitors, are subject to [ Vehicle Registration Tax (VRT) ](/en/moving-
country/moving-to-ireland/coming-to-live-in-ireland/importing-car-into-
ireland#lf752b) and must be [ registered with Revenue
](https://www.revenue.ie/en/importing-vehicles-duty-free-allowances/guide-to-
vrt/index.aspx) . VRT must be paid when you first register your car.

###  Vehicle Registration Tax (VRT)

If you buy the car from a dealer, they will register it and pay the VRT to
Revenue. This means the total you pay for the vehicle should include the cost
of VRT. [ Value Added Tax (VAT) ](/en/money-and-tax/tax/duties-and-vat/value-
added-tax/) is also charged on the sale of most products.

After the dealer registers the car and pays the VRT, they will get:

  * A receipt for the VRT paid, showing the car’s registration number 
  * An RF100 form 

When buying a car, make sure the dealer gives you the correct VRT receipt and
RF100 form. You will need this when applying to your local motor tax office.

###  Registering a car yourself (without a dealer)

In all other cases (for example, where you buy a car abroad and bring it into
Ireland), you are responsible for registering the vehicle at a [ National Car
Testing Service Centre (NCTS) ](https://www.ncts.ie/) . You can book an
appointment online or over-the-phone. The following timeframes apply:

  * **Booking an appointment for vehicle testing:** this must be done within 7 days of the vehicle entering Ireland 
  * **Registering the vehicle:** this must be done within 30 days of it arriving into Ireland 

Find out more about [ importing a vehicle to Ireland ](/en/moving-
country/moving-to-ireland/coming-to-live-in-ireland/importing-car-into-
ireland/) .

###  Tax relief and exemptions

There are different reductions, reliefs and exemptions from VRT.

Visit Revenue’s website for information on [ VRT reliefs and exemptions
](http://www.revenue.ie/en/tax/vrt/reliefs-exemptions.html) and [ VRT
reductions for certain electrical vehicles
](https://www.revenue.ie/en/vrt/calculating-vrt/electric-hybrid-vehicles.aspx)
.

You may also claim tax relief under the [ Disabled Drivers and Disabled
Passengers Scheme ](/en/travel-and-recreation/transport-and-disability/tax-
relief-for-disabled-drivers-and-disabled-passengers/) .

###  Registration plates

If you buy your car from a dealer, they must register it and give you [
registration plates ](/en/travel-and-recreation/vehicle-standards/vehicle-
registration-numbers/) when you collect your car. You must display the plates
on your car **within 3 days** from the registration date.

The dealer must also have the new registration plates fitted before you take
it away.

If you register the car yourself at an NCT centre and your VRT payment has
been accepted, Revenue will give you the registration number assigned to the
vehicle. You can buy Irish number plates at the NCT centre on the day of the
inspection.

You must register the vehicle before you can pay motor tax. It is an offence
to drive an unregistered vehicle in Ireland.

###  Vehicle registration certificate

The [ vehicle registration certificate ](https://www.gov.ie/en/policy-
information/1ba443-motor-taxvehicle-registration/) for your car is issued by
the Department of Transport. This will be posted out to you after you have
applied to your local motor tax office to pay motor tax on your vehicle.

##  Motor tax

By law, you must pay motor tax for your vehicle. You can pay motor tax for a
new vehicle:

  * By post 
  * In person at your [ local motor tax office ](https://www.gov.ie/en/service/1fc151-find-your-local-motor-tax-office/)
  * Online at [ motortax.ie ](https://www.motortax.ie/OMT/) . 

The amount of tax depends on the type of car you have bought. For new cars,
motor tax is calculated on the vehicle’s CO2 emissions. When taxing a new or
imported car, you will need to provide the RF100 form (from the motor dealer).

Find out more about [ motor tax ](/en/travel-and-recreation/motoring/motor-
tax-and-insurance/motor-tax-rates/) .

##  Motor insurance

By law, you must have motor insurance before you can drive in a public place
and you must display the insurance disc on the windscreen. It is a serious
offence to drive without insurance. If you do, you could be fined, have [
penalty points ](/en/travel-and-recreation/motoring/driving-offences/penalty-
points-for-driving-offences/) put on your driving licence, or be disqualified
from driving.

Find out more about [ motor insurance ](/en/travel-and-
recreation/motoring/motor-tax-and-insurance/motor-insurance/) .

##  Vehicle labelling

A colour-coded labelling system for new cars shows their carbon dioxide (CO2)
emissions. These labels are displayed on, or near, any new car for sale.

The first section of the label shows the emission band for the vehicle. The
second section of the label tells you:

  * How much fuel the vehicle will use over 18,000km 
  * The annual motor tax 
  * The rate of VRT 

Other sections give information such as the make, engine capacity, and fuel
type of the car.  

##  If things go wrong

If you have a problem with a new car, contact the seller (the garage or car
dealership) so that they can fix the problem. If you can't resolve the problem
or you are not satisfied with the response, you can contact:

  * [ The Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC) ](https://www.ccpc.ie/consumers/) for advice about consumer issues, such as faulty cars, regulation of credit intermediaries and unfair commercial practices. 
  * [ The Society of the Irish Motor Industry (SIMI) ](https://www.simi.ie/en) who are the representative body for the motor industry in Ireland. [ SIMI members ](https://www.simi.ie/en/find-a-member) include dealers, repairers, wholesalers, retailers and vehicle testers. All SIMI members must follow a code of ethics. It may be able to help you, through its [ consumer complaints mediation service ](https://www.simi.ie/en/consumer-help/complaints-service) .
