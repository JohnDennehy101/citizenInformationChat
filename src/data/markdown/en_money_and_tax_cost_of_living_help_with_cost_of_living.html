  * Managing your income 
  * Once-off payments in Budget 2024 

##  Introduction

Prices have been rising and you may be struggling to pay for the everyday
things you need to support yourself and your family.

This page has advice on some of the supports that are available and
information about how you can manage your money.

##  Claiming social welfare

You may be able to get social welfare assistance even if you work full-time or
have never claimed a payment before. There are many [ types of social welfare
payment
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/)
and you can find the rules of each payment in our [ social welfare section
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/)
.

###  Additional Needs Payment

The [ Additional Needs Payment ](/en/social-welfare/supplementary-welfare-
schemes/additional-needs-payment/) can help you with an expense that you
cannot pay from your weekly income. The amount that you can get depends on
your circumstances and the type of help you need. You can get the Additional
Needs Payment for:

  * An increase in your fuel or electricity costs 
  * Essential repairs to property, including motor vehicles and replacing household appliances and furniture 
  * Funeral costs 
  * Deposits for private rented accommodation 
  * Bedding and cooking utensils, if you are setting up home for the first time 
  * Food, clothing and shelter after an emergency event such as a fire or flood 
  * Recurring travel costs to hospital 
  * Visiting a relative in hospital or prison 

This is not a complete list, other expenses can be covered too.

###  Working Family Payment

[ Working Family Payment (WFP) ](/en/social-welfare/families-and-
children/working-family-payment/) is a weekly payment for employees with
children. It supports people who are on low pay who work at least 38 hours per
fortnight. The amount you get depends on how many children you have and the
amount of money you take home.

###  Other social welfare supports

You can get information about:

  * [ Payments to families and children ](/en/social-welfare/families-and-children/payments-to-families-and-children/)
  * [ Benefits for people who are sick or have a disability ](/en/social-welfare/disability-and-illness/benefits-to-people-who-are-sick-or-have-a-disability/)
  * [ Losing your job ](/en/employment/unemployment-and-redundancy/losing-your-job/losing-job-entitlements/)

##  Housing costs

You could qualify for help with paying your rent through the Housing
Assistance Payment. If you have difficulties paying your mortgage, you should
talk to your mortgage provider as soon as possible. You can get advice from
the [ Money Advice and Budgeting Service (MABS) ](https://mabs.ie/contact/) .

###  Housing Assistance Payment (HAP)

The [ Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) ](/en/housing/renting-a-home/help-with-
renting/housing-assistance-payment/) is a social housing support for people
who have a long-term housing need. The rent must be within set rent limits
that depend on the size of your family. Local authorities can now go up to 35%
above the [ HAP rent limits. ](/en/housing/renting-a-home/housing-assistance-
payment#l5e5ea)

###  Rent increases

If you live in a [ Rent Pressure Zone ](/en/housing/renting-a-home/rent-
increases#lcfdd0) , your landlord cannot increase the rent by more than 2% per
year. [ Outside of Rent Pressure Zones ](/en/housing/renting-a-home/rent-
increases#l4c97b) , your landlord can increase rent in line with the current
market value for similar properties in the area.

Your landlord cannot [ increase the rent ](/en/housing/renting-a-
home/landlords-rights-and-responsibilities/rent-increases-in-private-rented-
housing/) more than once per year. Disputes about rent increases can be
referred to the Residential Tenancies Board.

  * [ Problems paying your rent ](https://mabs.ie/tackling-debt/rent-problems/)

###  **Mortgage interest tax credit**

A new temporary [ mortgage interest tax credit ](/en/housing/owning-a-
home/buying-a-home/mortgage-interest-relief/) was announced in Budget 2024 for
homeowners who had an outstanding mortgage balance of between €80,000 and
€500,000 on their primary home on 31 December 2022.

The Mortgage Interest Tax Relief is available on the increased interest you
pay on your mortgage in 2023 when compared with the amount you paid in 2022.
The tax relief on the increase is 20%, which is the standard income tax rate.
The relief is capped at €1,250.

This tax credit only applies to tax assessments for 2023.

###  Rent Tax Credit

A new [ Rent Tax Credit ](/en/money-and-tax/tax/housing-taxes-and-
reliefs/rent-tax-credit/) was introduced in December 2022. The Rent Tax Credit
will be available for the years 2022 to 2025.

##  Childcare and back to school

The [ Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) ](/en/education/pre-school-
education-and-childcare/early-childhood-care-and-education-scheme/) programme

school child ](/en/education/primary-and-post-primary-education/going-to-post-

school child ](/en/education/primary-and-post-primary-education/going-to-post-
primary-school/post-primary-school-transport-scheme/) , up to a limit of €125
per family.

households. If you are worried about paying your [ gas

](/en/housing/housing-grants-and-schemes/grants-for-home-renovations-and-
improvements/grants-for-a-home-energy-upgrade/) and improve the BER rating of

solar-panels/) .
