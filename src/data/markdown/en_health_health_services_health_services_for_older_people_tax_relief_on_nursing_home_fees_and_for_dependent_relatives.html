#  Tax relief on nursing home fees and for dependent relatives

  * Introduction 

##  Introduction

Income tax relief is available on fees paid for nursing homes.

There also are a number of other tax reliefs for carers and people with
disabilities.

###  Tax relief on nursing home fees

You claim tax relief for nursing home fees under the general scheme for tax
relief on medical expenses.

You can claim this relief at your highest rate of [ income tax
](http://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/money_and_tax/tax/income_tax/) if the
nursing home provides 24-hour on-site nursing care.

If you are paying the charges for a nursing home you can claim the tax relief
whether you are in the nursing home yourself or you are paying for another
person to be there.

For further information, including how to apply, see [ taxation and medical
expenses ](/en/money-and-tax/tax/income-tax-credits-and-reliefs/taxation-and-
medical-expenses/) .

###  Other tax reliefs

You can claim [ tax relief on the cost of employing a carer ](/en/money-and-
tax/tax/tax-credits-and-reliefs-for-people-with-disabilities/tax-relief-for-
employing-a-home-carer/) for yourself or for another family member.

If you are caring for a dependent relative you may qualify for the [ Dependent
Relative Tax Credit ](/en/money-and-tax/tax/tax-credits-and-reliefs-for-
people-with-disabilities/dependent-relative-tax-credit/) .

A deed of covenant is a legally binding agreement that is written down and
agreed between two people stating that one agrees to pay money to the other
without getting any benefit in return. [ Tax relief on a Deed of Covenant
](/en/money-and-tax/tax/income-tax-credits-and-reliefs/deeds-of-covenant/) is
available if it is made to a permanently incapacitated minor, permanently
incapacitated adult, or person over 65 years of age.

There are also a number of other [ tax reliefs for people with disabilities
](http://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/money_and_tax/tax/tax_credits_and_reliefs_for_people_with_disabilities/)
.
