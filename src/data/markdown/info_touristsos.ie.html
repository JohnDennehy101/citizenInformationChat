##  Success Stories

Here’s some examples of feedback we have received from international visitors
we have supported

###  Assisted in getting me a replacement ID

“I wanted to thank you again for your help with my lost ID! Tourists in Dublin
can be really glad to have you. So thank you very very much.”

Visitor, Germany

###  Put my mind at ease when I couldn’t get home

“Thanks to your precious intervention, I was able to take the Ryanair flight
back to Beauvais yesterday. I just want to thank you very much for your
assistance and kindness. ”

Visitor, France

###  You and the Dublin police helped me a lot

“I visited Dublin and I had a problem because someone stole my wallet. Both
you and the Dublin police helped me a lot - I am going to remember you and
your wonderful city all my life. This weekend I'm going back to Dublin”

Visitor, Spain

###  Thank you all so much for your quick help

“Thank you all so much for your quick help. If it wasn’t for you we would have
found ourselves in huge troubles. We can’t thank you enough.”

Visitor, Poland

###  When I first walked into the police station, I thought for sure that my
student and I would have to stay behind in Dublin

“When I first walked into the police station, I thought for sure that my
student and I would have to stay behind in Dublin when the rest of the group
went home. I never would have thought it possible that we'd be able to make
our flight. When I walked out of your office, I was optimistic and my student
felt confident and relieved as well. You really did work miracles and we are
beyond grateful! ”

Visitor, Germany

###  I just want to thank you again for your help and all the valuable
information

“I just want to thank you again for your help and all the valuable information
you gave us. It's so kind. And despite all the events we will come back in
Irlande, no doubt of that : you have a beautiful country and the Irish are so
kind ”

Visitor France
