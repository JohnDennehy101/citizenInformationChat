##  Third-level educational institutions

The third-level education sector in Ireland is broadly divided into the:

  * University sector 
  * Technological sector 
  * Colleges of education 

There are also a number of independent private colleges.

The [ Higher Education Authority ](http://www.hea.ie/) is the statutory agency
responsible for the effective governance and regulation of the higher
education system. It has an advisory role in relation to the whole sector of
third-level education.

###  University sector

The universities in Ireland are:

  * The National University of Ireland (NUI) which is the umbrella university covering [ University College Dublin (UCD), ](http://www.ucd.ie/) [ University of Galway (UG) ](http://www.nuigalway.ie/) , [ University College Cork (UCC), ](http://www.ucc.ie/en/) and [ National University of Ireland, Maynooth ](http://www.maynoothuniversity.ie/) . 
  * The University of Dublin, which is generally known as [ Trinity College Dublin (TCD) ](http://www.tcd.ie/)
  * [ The University of Limerick (UL) ](http://www.ul.ie/)
  * [ Dublin City University (DCU) ](http://www.dcu.ie/)
  * [ RCSI University of Medicine and Health Sciences ](https://www.rcsi.com/dublin/)

Most universities in Ireland are State-funded, but they are generally
autonomous. The Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland (RCSI) is a private
university.

###  Technological sector

The technological sector includes:

  * Technological universities (TUs) 
  * Institutes of technology (ITs) 

The [ Technological Universities Act 2018
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2018/act/3/enacted/en/html) allows
institutes of technology to apply to become a new type of higher education
institution with technological university status. TUs and ITs provide
programmes of education and training in areas such as business, science,
engineering, linguistics and music to certificate, diploma and degree levels.

There are 5 technological universities:

  * [ Technological University Dublin (TU Dublin) ](https://www.tudublin.ie/) – formerly Dublin, Tallaght and Blanchardstown institutes of technology 
  * [ Munster Technological University MTU) ](https://www.mtu.ie/) – formerly Cork and Tralee institutes of technology 
  * [ Technological University of the Shannon: Midlands Midwest (TUS) ](https://tus.ie/) – formerly Limerick and Athlone institutes of technology 
  * [ Atlantic Technological University (ATU) ](https://www.atu.ie/) – formerly Galway-Mayo, Sligo and Letterkenny institutes of technology 
  * [ South East Technological University (SETU) ](https://www.setu.ie/) – formerly Carlow and Waterford institutes of technology 

There are 2 institutes of technology:

  * [ Institute of Art, Design and Technology (IADT) ](http://www.iadt.ie/en/) , Dun Laoghaire 
  * [ Dundalk Institute of Technology ](http://ww2.dkit.ie/)

###  Colleges of education

Several colleges of education in Ireland provide specialised training for
primary school teachers. They offer a 3-year Bachelor of Education degree and
an 18-month postgraduate diploma.

Post-primary teachers generally do a primary degree, followed by a
postgraduate diploma.

Read more about [ teacher qualifications ](/en/education/primary-and-post-
primary-education/teachers-and-schools/teacher-qualifications/) .

###  Other colleges

In addition to State-funded colleges, a number of fee-paying third-level
educational institutions offer courses, mainly in professional vocational
training and business.

Some of these colleges are linked to universities or professional associations
and their qualifications may be accredited accordingly (see 'Third-level
qualifications' below).

##  Third-level qualifications

The [ National Framework of Qualifications (NFQ) ](https://www.qqi.ie/what-we-
do/the-qualifications-system/national-framework-of-qualifications) is a system
of 10 levels which allows the different standards and levels qualifications to
be compared. The NFQ is aligned to the [ European Framework of Qualifications.
](https://www.cedefop.europa.eu/en/events-and-projects/projects/european-
qualifications-framework-eqf) The NFQ can also help you to compare a foreign
qualification with its Irish equivalent and can help with the recognition of
Irish qualifications abroad.

You can see a [ diagram of the NFQ ](https://www.qqi.ie/what-we-do/the-
qualifications-system/national-framework-of-qualifications) on the website of
the [ Quality and Qualifications Ireland (QQI) ](https://www.qqi.ie/) . Third-
level qualifications are Levels 6-10 in the Framework.

###  Award of qualifications

In the university sector, the awarding bodies are:

  * National University of Ireland (UCD, UG, UCC and Maynooth) 
  * Trinity College Dublin 
  * University of Limerick 
  * Dublin City University 
  * RCSI University of Medicine and Health Sciences 

Technological universities (TUs) make their own awards.

[ Quality and Qualifications Ireland (QQI) ](https://www.qqi.ie/) is the
awarding body for:

  * Third-level educational institutions outside the university sector 
  * Further education and training 
  * Higher Certificates (NFQ Level 6) 

Read more about [ further and higher education qualifications.
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/education/third-level-
education/colleges-and-qualifications/fet-qualifications/)

####  Universities

The State-supported universities all award their own degrees and other awards.

University students generally graduate with an:

  * Ordinary Bachelors degree (NFQ Level 7), or 
  * Honours Bachelors degree (NFQ Level 8) 

Universities also offer Masters degrees (NFQ Level 9) and Doctoral degrees
(NFQ Level 10).

####  Technological sector

Technological universities (TUs) make their own awards. Institutes of
technology (ITs) grant degrees, diplomas and certificates from NFQ Level 6 to
Level 10, which are validated by QQI.

####  Other colleges

The other State-supported colleges generally grant awards that are validated
by QQI.

The private colleges make awards, some of which are validated by foreign
universities and some of which are validated by QQI.

####  Progression in education

Progression is a feature of the National Framework of Qualifications (NFQ).
Often a Level 6 certificate awarded by QQI can offer the opportunity to
continue on to a NFQ Level 7 or Level 8 degree.

The [ Higher Education Links Scheme ](https://www.qqi.ie/what-we-do/qqi-
awards/going-to-higher-education-using-my-qqi-award-learner) allows people
with a QQI Level 5 and Level 6 (NFQ) qualification to progress to higher
education.

####  Listed awarding bodies

There are some awarding bodies whose qualifications are not included on the
National Framework of Qualifications (NFQ), for example, professional bodies
in areas of law and accountancy.

QQI has created a new category for these bodies called ‘listed awarding bodies
(LABs)’.

Under a new scheme, these bodies can apply for voluntary, regulated access to
the NFQ. The LABs scheme is expected to open in 2024 on a phased basis.

Read more about [ listed awarding bodies on the QQI website
](https://www.qqi.ie/what-we-do/the-qualifications-system/listed-awarding-
bodies) .

##  How to apply for third-level education

If you are thinking of [ going to college
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/education/third-level-
education/colleges-and-qualifications/going-to-college/) , you can search the
[ Qualifax website ](http://www.qualifax.ie/) for details of courses and the
entrance requirements.

Applications for undergraduate courses in Ireland are usually made through the
[ Central Applications Office (CAO). ](http://www.cao.ie/)

](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/education/third-level-
education/applying-to-college/tertiary-education-programme/) offers another
route to third-level education. You start your course in a further education
college and you then progress to third level to complete your degree in a

##  Postgraduate study

Postgraduate study can be a taught course or based on research and generally
falls into one of the following categories:

  * Postgraduate diploma 
  * Masters degree 
  * PhD (Doctorate degree) 

####  Postgraduate diploma

Often this is a vocational course, linked to professions such as teaching or
librarianship. The subject may be different from the primary degree.

####  Masters degree

This can be a taught course or based on research. It lasts 1-2 years and
usually involves course work and a thesis.

####  PhD

This is a doctorate awarded for a thesis based on research. It takes at least
3 years' study, and it must be an original contribution to knowledge.

###  Funding postgraduate study

In general, you will have to pay fees for postgraduate courses. You may be
able to get [ tax relief on the fees.
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/education/third-level-education/fees-
and-supports-for-third-level-education/tax-relief-for-third-level-fees/)

If you got a third-level grant for your undergraduate course, you may qualify
for [ a grant for postgraduate study in Ireland, including Northern Ireland
](/en/education/third-level-education/fees-and-supports-for-third-level-
education/postgraduate-student-grant/) .

There are different sources of funding for postgraduate students. Institutions
running postgraduate courses may offer financial support, or you may need to
apply to an external body for funding.

A number of research bodies provide funding for postgraduate research in
Ireland, including:

  * The [ Irish Research Council ](https://research.ie/)
  * [ Science Foundation Ireland ](http://www.sfi.ie/)

Scholarships for study abroad are awarded annually by governments to Irish
students who have completed, or are currently studying, a third-level course
abroad.

[ studying outside Ireland
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/education/third-level-
education/studying-abroad/studying-outside-ireland/) .
