##  What is the Housing Assistance Payment?

The Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) is a social housing support for people
who have a long-term housing need.

The scheme is administered by the local authorities, who pay your landlord
directly.

The rent you are charged for the accommodation must be within the limits for
your household type in your local authority’s area – see ‘ [ What are the HAP
rent limits ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/housing/renting-a-
home/help-with-renting/housing-assistance-payment/#f60791) ’.

When you are a HAP tenant you pay a weekly HAP rent contribution to the local
authority, based on your income and ability to pay. **Under the HAP scheme you
can take up full-time employment and keep your housing support.**

There is detailed information about HAP on [ hap.ie ](http://hap.ie/) ,
including booklets for [ landlords (pdf)
](http://hap.ie/uploads/files/pdf/landlord-booklet-english.pdf) and [ tenants
(pdf) ](http://hap.ie/uploads/files/pdf/tenants-booklet-english.pdf) , along
with a [ general information leaflet (pdf)
](http://hap.ie/uploads/files/pdf/hap-info-leaflet-english.pdf) .

##  Who can get the HAP payment?

To get the Housing Assistance Payment, you must be on the [ local authority’s
housing list ](/en/housing/local-authority-and-social-housing/social-housing-
waiting-lists/) . This means that you qualify for social housing support.

To qualify for social housing support, you must:

  1. **Have a legal right to remain in the State on a long-term basis** . People who have temporary protection, such as Ukrainians fleeing the war, cannot apply for social housing as their right to remain is short-term. 
  2. **Be** **eligible** **for social housing** . Your income must be below a certain amount, and you must not have suitable alternative accommodation. 
  3. **Be** **in need of** **social housing**

Our page [ applying for local authority/social housing ](/en/housing/local-
authority-and-social-housing/applying-for-local-authority-housing/) has
details of how the local authority assesses you for social housing support.

You cannot transfer from any other form of social housing to HAP. However, you
may be asked to transfer from Rent Supplement to HAP – see ‘ [ How do I apply
for HAP ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/housing/renting-a-home/help-
with-renting/housing-assistance-payment/#9ea5bb) ’.

##  How does the HAP scheme work?

You must find your own private rented accommodation within the HAP rent
limits. The local authority will not find the accommodation for you.

You [ cannot be discriminated against when renting because you are getting
certain payments, ](https://www.ihrec.ie/your-rights/advertising/housing-
assistance-payment/) including HAP, so landlords cannot state that HAP is not
accepted when advertising accommodation.

The local authority pays the landlord each month and you pay a weekly rent
contribution to the local authority. However, you are not a local authority
tenant. The rental agreement is between you and your landlord and your tenancy
is covered by residential tenancies legislation. This means that you have
certain [ rights and responsibilities ](/en/housing/renting-a-home/tenants-
rights-and-responsibilities/tenants-rights-and-obligations/) , as will [ your
landlord ](/en/housing/renting-a-home/landlords-rights-and-
responsibilities/landlords-rights-and-obligations/) . Your tenancy must be [
registered with the Residential Tenancies Board ](/en/housing/renting-a-
home/landlords-rights-and-responsibilities/registering-a-tenancy/) every year.

You may be able to claim HAP if you are [ sharing accommodation with your
landlord ](/en/housing/renting-a-home/tenants-rights-and-
responsibilities/sharing-accommodation-with-your-landlord/) .

##  What are the HAP rent limits?

In general, the rent must be within the [ HAP rent limits
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2017/si/56/made/en/print) for your
household size and the area you live in.

However, local authorities have flexibility to go above the HAP rent limits,
if you can’t find accommodation within the limits. They do this on a case-by-
case basis and can:

  * Go up to 35% above the rent limits. This [ flexibility was increased from 20% to 35% on 11 July 2022 ](https://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2022/si/342/made/en/pdf) and applies to new and existing HAP tenancies. 
  * Increase the HAP rates for a single person to the rates allowed for couples. This has been allowed since 11 July 2022 and applies to new HAP tenancies. 

There is also flexibility, on a case-by-case basis, for eligible homeless
households in the Dublin region, see [ What is Homeless HAP
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/housing/renting-a-home/help-with-
renting/housing-assistance-payment/#1f24b0) .

The table below shows the maximum monthly rent limits in each local authority
area for different types of household. If you have 4 or more children in your
household, contact your local authority to discuss your HAP rate.

##  What if I find accommodation in another local authority area?

If you qualify for social housing support in one local authority area, but
find suitable rented accommodation in another area, you may be able to get HAP
from the first local authority to help pay for it. This means you won’t have
to be reassessed for social housing support or reapply for HAP in the new
area.

This process is known as Inter-Authority Movement of Housing Assistance
Payment (HAP) Scheme Applicants.

To qualify, one of the following must apply:

  * The [ income limit for social housing support ](https://www.gov.ie/pdf/?file=https://assets.gov.ie/236056/59ecede4-f862-4c5d-bf5a-e1a1d4ff9a63.pdf#page=null) in the new local authority area is the same or higher than the limit in the area where you qualified. (There are 3 different qualifying income limits for social housing support, with different limits applying to different locations.) 
  * Your income is below the social housing support limit in the new local authority area, if the income limit in that area is lower than in the area where you qualified. This will be verified by the local authority. 
  * Both local authority areas offer ‘shared areas of choice’ in their housing allocations schemes. 

You may also need to meet other criteria to qualify. The local authority will
decide on your case.

###  **How does it work?**

Your original local authority will treat you as if you are renting
accommodation in their area. Their housing allocations scheme will apply to
you and you can be added to their social housing transfer list.

However, the new local authority will be responsible for inspecting the
property and the HAP rent limits for the new area will apply to the property.

If you have questions about this process, you should contact your [ local
authority ](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/942f74-local-authorities/) for
more information.

##  What is Homeless HAP?

The [ Homeless HAP scheme ](https://www.homelessdublin.ie/homeless-hap) is
operated by the Dublin Region Homeless Executive (DRHE) for the Dublin local
authorities. It provides discretion to exceed the HAP rent limits by up to 50%
for homeless households, if this is necessary to source suitable
accommodation. To qualify for Homeless HAP, a household must be accepted as
homeless within the meaning of [ section 2 of the Housing Act 1988
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1988/act/28/section/2/enacted/en/html) by
one of the 4 Dublin local authorities.

A Homeless HAP Place Finder Service is available in all local authority areas.
This Service helps homeless households or households at immediate risk of
homelessness, who are finding it difficult to get a HAP tenancy. The local
authority can help with any deposit or advance rental payments needed to get
accommodation under the HAP scheme.

The [ Dublin Place Finder Service
](https://councilmeetings.dublincity.ie/documents/s2209/HAP%20Dublin%20Place%20Finder.pdf)
also supports homeless households in the Dublin region to find a tenancy using
HAP. You should contact the housing section of [ your local authority
](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/942f74-local-authorities/) for further
information on this.

##  What happens when you are a HAP tenant?

When you have qualified for social housing support and are getting HAP, you
will continue to get the payment, even if you no longer meet all the
qualifying criteria of the social housing assessment. For example, if your
income rises above the income threshold for social housing, you will remain
eligible for HAP. However, you must inform the local authority if your income
changes, so they can recalculate the differential rent you pay, see Rent
contribution below.

The local authority will inspect your accommodation within 8 months of the
first HAP payment to your landlord, unless the accommodation has already been
inspected in the last twelve months. An inspector will check that the
accommodation meets the [ minimum standards for rented housing
](/en/housing/renting-a-home/tenants-rights-and-responsibilities/minimum-
standards-for-rented-homes/) .

Your housing needs have now been met under HAP and you will no longer be on
the local authority’s [ housing waiting list ](/en/housing/local-authority-
and-social-housing/social-housing-waiting-lists/) . However, if you still want
to be considered for local authority housing or housing provided by an [
approved housing body ](/en/housing/local-authority-and-social-
housing/approved-housing-bodies/) , you can apply to the local authority to be
placed on the transfer list.

###  How much rent do I pay the local authority?

The weekly rent contribution that you pay will be based on the current
‘differential rent scheme’ for your local authority. This scheme links the
rent contribution a household must pay to the household income and the ability
to pay. If your income increases so does your rent contribution, and if your
income decreases, the weekly rent contribution decreases.

You must notify the local authority of any changes in your income or household
size, so that your rent contribution can be recalculated. If you take up a job
or increase your working hours, you will still be eligible for HAP, as there
is no income limit for HAP once you have qualified for the scheme. Check with
[ your local authority ](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/942f74-local-
authorities/) for the details of their differential rent scheme.

###  How do I pay rent to the local authority?

Your weekly rent contribution to the local authority should be paid using
either:

  * The [ Household Budget Scheme ](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/claiming-a-social-welfare-payment/household-budget-scheme/) at the post office 
  * A standing order with your bank 

If your rent is not automatically paid in these 2 ways, you can pay it:

  * [ Online using the Housing Assistance Payment Portal ](https://happayments.limerick.ie/#/login)
  * Using the [ HAP app (pdf) ](https://www.hap.ie/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/HAPAppHowToGuide.pdf)
  * By phone on 061 529 654 
  * Using a HAP Bill Pay Card in any Post Office or shop that uses [ PostPoint ](https://www.postpoint.ie/)

You can also get a statement of your HAP payments online or using the HAP app.

If you overpay your rent by mistake, you can [ apply for a refund
](https://www.hap.ie/tenants/howtoapplyrefund/) .

###  Paying your landlord

The local authority will make the HAP payment to your landlord on the last
Wednesday of each month. This payment is subject to certain [ conditions
](https://www.hap.ie/tenants/terms/) :

  * You must pay your weekly HAP rent contribution to the local authority – if not, the local authority will stop paying your landlord 
  * If you get a social welfare payment at a post office, you must pay your HAP contribution through the [ Household Budget Scheme ](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/claiming-a-social-welfare-payment/household-budget-scheme/)
  * The accommodation must meet [ minimum standards for rented housing ](/en/housing/renting-a-home/tenants-rights-and-responsibilities/minimum-standards-for-rented-homes/)
  * Your landlord must have current evidence of tax compliance 
  * You and anyone in your household must not engage in [ anti-social behaviour ](/en/housing/local-authority-and-social-housing/anti-social-behaviour-and-rent-arrears-in-social-housing/)

Find more information about these [ terms and conditions on hap.ie
](https://www.hap.ie/) .

All local authorities use the HAP Shared Services Centre, which is based in
Limerick, to collect rents from HAP tenants and make HAP rental payments to
landlords.

###  Additional rent payments and deposits

If your rent is more than the HAP limits allowed for your household, you must
pay the additional amount directly to your landlord. However, your local
authority must make sure that your tenancy is sustainable, so you will not get
a HAP payment if you can’t afford the rent.

If your landlord needs a deposit, you will have to pay this yourself. The
local authority will not pay it for you. In certain circumstances, you may be
able to get [ assistance from the Department of Social Protection
](/en/social-welfare/supplementary-welfare-schemes/) to help with paying your
deposit. If you are in emergency homeless accommodation, your local authority
may help with a deposit.

###  What if I need to end my HAP tenancy?

You will be expected to stay in your HAP accommodation for at least 2 years,
but in some situations you may be able to apply for a new HAP payment
somewhere else. For example, if you are offered a job in another town or if
your family grows too large for the property. You will need to contact your
local authority if you are thinking of moving.

If a tenant or a landlord wants to end a residential tenancy, they must [
comply with the relevant legislation ](/en/housing/renting-a-home/tenants-
rights-and-responsibilities/if-your-landlord-wants-you-to-leave/) . Read more
on [ Threshold’s website ](http://www.threshold.ie/advice/ending-a-tenancy/) .

##  How do I apply for HAP?

If you are not yet on your local authority’s housing list, you will need to [
apply for social housing support ](/en/housing/local-authority-and-social-
housing/applying-for-local-authority-housing/) in the usual way.

If you are already on the housing list, you can ask your local authority for a
HAP application form. This form only needs to be filled in when you have found
suitable accommodation, or if you are already in private rented accommodation
and eligible to transfer to HAP. Your landlord will need to complete and sign
part of the HAP application form.

If you are a tenant and in any doubt about whether your tenancy arrangement
qualifies for HAP, check with your local authority.

If you are homeless in the Dublin region, contact the Dublin Place Finder
Service on [ placefinders@dublincity.ie ](mailto:placefinders@dublincity.ie)
or contact the homeless section of your [ local authority
](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/942f74-local-authorities/) to apply for
HAP.

If you are getting Rent Supplement and qualify for social housing support, you
can apply for HAP for your existing accommodation.

If you have been getting Rent Supplement for a long time (generally 18 months
or more) you may get a letter from the Department of Social Protection, asking
you to contact your local authority to apply for social housing support (which
includes HAP). You may then be transferred to HAP or to another form of social
housing support.

If you are approved for HAP, you then sign a Rent Contribution Agreement with
the local authority. You may be asked for a copy of the rental agreement with
your landlord.

##  How do I make a complaint?

You can complain if you don’t agree with a decision your local authority made
about your HAP application or payment, or you are unhappy with how they dealt
with you.

You complain to your [ local authority
](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/942f74-local-authorities/) first. They
should have an internal complaints procedure on their website with information
about:

  * How you can make a complaint 
  * How your complaint will be dealt with 
  * How long it will take to respond to you about your complaint 
  * How to appeal, if there is an internal appeals process 

If you are not happy with how your local authority deals with your complaint,
or you think you have been unfairly treated, you can take your complaint to
the Ombudsman. The [ Office of the Ombudsman
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/government-in-ireland/how-government-
works/standards-and-accountability/office-of-the-ombudsman/) investigates
complaints about local authorities and other public bodies.
