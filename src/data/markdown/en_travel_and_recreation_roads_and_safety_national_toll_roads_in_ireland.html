##  Introduction

Toll roads are roads that drivers must pay to use.

Many major new road developments are funded through _public private
partnerships_ . This means that the funding for the building **and**
maintenance of the road comes from the Irish State and private businesses.

These private businesses charge money for vehicles to use the roads they have
helped to build, and the charging is carried out through tolling.

[ Transport Infrastructure Ireland (TII) ](http://www.tii.ie/) oversees the
implementation of tolling in Ireland. TII is responsible for planning,
supervising constructing and maintaining all national roads.

TII can charge and collect tolls from vehicles under the [ Roads Act 1993
](http://revisedacts.lawreform.ie/eli/1993/act/14/revised/en/html) . For a new
toll charge to be introduced, bye-laws must be introduced.

The registered owner of a vehicle is legally responsible for paying the toll,
which means that you may be fined or prosecuted for not paying a toll, even if
you were not driving the vehicle.

##  New toll road schemes

Each time a toll scheme is proposed for a road, TII must:

  * Publish a public notice informing citizens in the area about the proposed road 
  * Produce a _Draft Toll Scheme_ that must be available for one month 
  * Serve a notice to the local authorities in the area where the toll road will be located 

Objections to the scheme must be made in writing on or before the specified
date.

The Draft Toll Scheme for a particular road and its accompanying _Explanatory
Statement_ will be prepared under the statutory provisions of the [ Roads Act
1993 ](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1993/en/act/pub/0014/index.html) , as
amended by the [ Planning and Development Act 2000
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2000/en/act/pub/0030/index.html) .

If objections to the Draft Toll Scheme are received and not withdrawn, TII
will arrange an oral hearing. The report and recommendations of the person
appointed to hold the hearing will be considered by the Board of TII before
deciding whether to adopt the Draft Toll Scheme.

TII may adopt the Draft Toll Scheme with or without modifications or may
refuse to adopt it.

The decision of TII on the Toll Scheme proposal will be published.

##  Exemptions from toll charges

Certain vehicles are exempt from toll charges, including vehicles belonging to
and used for official purposes by the [ Defence Forces ](/en/government-in-
ireland/security-and-emergency-services/defence-forces/) , vehicles used by [
An Garda Síochána ](/en/justice/law-enforcement/garda-siochana-national-
police-force/) , [ fire brigade ](/en/government-in-ireland/security-and-
emergency-services/fire-services/) vehicles and [ ambulances.
](/en/health/health-system/emergency-health-services-in-ireland/)

###  Adapted vehicles

Vehicles adapted for disabled drivers or passengers are also entitled to an
exemption from toll fees.

The [ Disability Toll Exemption Scheme (DTES) ](https://dtes.ie/dtes-scheme/)
allows drivers of qualifying vehicles to travel toll free on all Irish roads
using their DTES disc. Only one application is needed under this scheme.

To qualify, your vehicle must be eligible for tax relief under the [ Drivers
and Passengers with Disabilities Scheme ](/en/travel-and-recreation/transport-
and-disability/tax-relief-for-disabled-drivers-and-disabled-passengers/) .

You can apply for a DTES disc and read more information about the rules of the
scheme on [ dtes.ie. ](https://dtes.ie/dtes-scheme/)

If your vehicle is adapted and qualifies for tax relief, but you have not
applied for a DTES disc, you can still travel toll free by going to the manned
tollbooth and showing your tax disc.

###

##  How to pay a toll charge

Generally, toll charges are paid at the barrier to the toll road. You can pay
in cash, or by using an eToll tag. For the M50, if you do not have an account
you must [ pay online ](http://eflow.ie/) , by phoning Locall 0818 50 10 50 or
through [ Payzone outlets ](http://www.payzone.ie/) .

To get an eToll tag, contact one of the [ companies that provide electronic
tolling tags. ](https://www.etoll.ie/getting-a-tag/irish-tag-companies/) If
you have a complaint about a toll road operator or your electronic tag
provider, you should contact the company to find out how to make a complaint.

The [ toll rates for the toll roads are available on tii.ie
](https://www.tii.ie/roads-tolling/tolling-information/toll-locations-and-
charges/) .

If you are registered for VAT, you can reclaim VAT paid on tolls.

###  Electronic tolling (eTolls)

Electronic tolling uses a small electronic tag that is placed in the vehicle
and is detected each time your vehicle passes through the toll. The toll is
then debited against the customer's account. The electronic tolling system
automatically recognises the correct toll for the class of vehicle you are
driving.

There are several companies providing electronic tags to motorists. All these
providers use the same system, which means you only need one tag for all
tolling facilities. Information on suppliers of electronic tags and the
different types of tag accounts is available at [ etoll.ie
](https://www.etoll.ie/getting-a-tag/account-types/)

###  M50

The M50 operates a barrier-free tolling scheme called eFlow. This allows all
motorists to pass through the toll at motorway speed. There are a few ways you
can pay the tolls, including using an electronic tag from eFlow or another
supplier. Charges vary depending on the method used. You cannot pay the toll
with cash at the M50, but the toll must be paid by 8pm the next day. You can
find out more about the toll scheme at [ eflow.ie
](https://www.eflow.ie/frequently-asked-questions/) .

###  Dublin Port Tunnel

The Dublin Port Tunnel imposes a toll on cars, taxis, motorcycles, vans and
light commercial vehicles only. Commercial vehicles above 3.5 tonnes laden
weight and buses with more than 25 seats do not pay tolls.

##  What happens if I don’t pay a toll?

If you do not pay your tolls, these tolls and penalties can be recovered
through a criminal or civil procedure.

###  Criminal procedure

You can be charged with an offence for not paying your toll or not obeying the
instruction of a person authorised to manage and operate a toll road. The
penalty on [ summary conviction ](/en/justice/criminal-law/criminal-
trial/fines-for-criminal-offences/) is a fine of up to €5,000 or a term of
imprisonment of up to 6 months, or both.

On the M50, the bye-laws set out penalties for those who fail, refuse or
neglect to pay toll fees. The penalty charge will increase after a certain
number of days if you do not pay. You can [ get more information about these
charges from TII ](https://www.tii.ie/roads-tolling/tolling-information/toll-
locations-and-charges/) .

###  Civil procedure

The number of tolls and penalties due are recoverable as a contract debt.

**The registered owner of a vehicle is responsible even if they are not
driving the vehicle.**
