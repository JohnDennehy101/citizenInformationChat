##  Introduction

Secondary school in Ireland is similar to ‘high school’ in other countries. In
general, children start secondary school when they are 12 or 13.

Depending on your child’s age when you return to Ireland, they will start
secondary school in one of 6 years. See the table below for the general age
range of students in each school year:

**Secondary school year** |  **Student age range**  
---|---  
First year  |  12-13   
Second year  |  13-14   
Third year  |  14-15   
Fourth year  |  15-16   
Fifth year  |  16-17   
Sixth year  |  17-18   
  
All children in Ireland are entitled to free secondary school education. Most
children attend public secondary schools that are funded by the State.

##  Private secondary school and home-schooling

While most children attend public secondary schools, you can choose to send
your child to private school or educate them at home.

###  **Private school**

There are a small number of private secondary schools around the country.
Private schools are not free so you must pay annual tuition fees. Check with
the school directly for details of their fees and curriculum.

Private secondary schools are also called ‘independent schools’ and ‘non-
recognised schools’. If you send your child to an independent school, you must
[ register with the Alternative Education Assessment & Registration Service
(AEARS) ](https://www.tusla.ie/services/family-community-support/alternative-
education-assessment-and-registration-service/independent-schools/) in Tusla.
The AEARS regulates education outside of recognised schools.

###  **Home-school**

You have a right to educate your child at home, rather than send them to
school. Depending on your child’s age, you may need to [ apply for
registration to home school from the Alternative Education Assessment &
Registration Service ](https://www.tusla.ie/services/family-community-
support/alternative-education-assessment-and-registration-service/home-
education/) (AEARS) in Tusla, before you begin home-schooling. The AEARS
regulates education outside of recognised schools.

You do not need a formal teaching qualification to home-school your child and
you don’t need to follow the national curriculum. However, you must give your
child a ‘certain minimum education’. See our page ‘ [ Teaching your child at
home ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/education/the-irish-education-
system/home-education/) ’ for more information.

##  Step 1: Choose a school type

Depending on where your family settles in Ireland, you may have a choice of
secondary schools nearby. The schools may be public (funded by the state) or
private (fee-paying).

Each school’s board of management or patron decides how it is run. For
example, a school can have a particular:

  * Religious ethos (for example, Catholic or multi-denominational) 
  * Language of instruction (English or Irish) 
  * Gender (all girls, all boys, or mixed) 

###  **Other differences**

All State-funded secondary schools must follow the national curriculum for:

  * [ Junior Cycle ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/education/primary-and-post-primary-education/going-to-post-primary-school/junior-cycle/) (for students in first, second and third year) 
  * [ Senior Cycle ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/education/primary-and-post-primary-education/going-to-post-primary-school/senior-cycle/) (for students in fifth and sixth year) 

But, secondary schools can vary in the subjects they provide. For example,
some schools offer a wider choice of international languages, while others
offer a wider range of practical subjects, like engineering and construction
studies.

Some schools give students the option to skip [ Transition Year
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/education/primary-and-post-primary-
education/going-to-post-primary-school/transition-year/) (fourth year), by
going directly from third year to fifth year. In other schools, Transition
Year is compulsory, and in some schools it’s not offered at all.

While all schools must teach to the Leaving Certificate (also called the
Established Leaving Certificate), some secondary schools also offer:

  * [ Leaving Certificate Applied ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/education/state-examinations/leaving-certificate-applied/)
  * [ Leaving Certificate Vocational Programme ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/education/state-examinations/leaving-certificate-vocational-programme/)

##  Step 2: Find schools in your area

You can [ search for secondary schools in your area using the Government’s
online directory ](https://www.education.ie/en/Find-a-School/) . You can
filter your search results by religious ethos, language of instruction, and
gender. You can then click into each individual school for their enrolment
numbers, contact details and inspection reports.

Most schools also have a website with information about their ethos, policies,
curriculum, and extra-curricular activities. If you can’t find the information
online, you can contact the school directly.

##  Step 3: Check if there is a place available

Contact the school directly to see if there is a place available for your
child. Every school has specific admission dates during which you can apply,
but schools can also accept students later in the year, if there are places
available.

If the school does not have enough places, it will give priority according to
its [ admissions policy ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/education/the-
irish-education-system/admissions-policies-in-primary-and-secondary-schools/)
.

###  Visit the school

When you find a school with a place available, you might want to arrange a
visit. Most schools can arrange a visit on a typical school day, to make sure
you and your child like it.

##  Step 4: Apply to the school

Always apply for a school place in writing. Check if the school has an
application form. If not, write a letter of application and address it to: The
Secretary, Board of Management, name and address of school. Remember to write
the date on your application.

Schools may ask for additional documents, such as previous school reports, a
birth certificate, and an educational assessment. Schools cannot ask for a
baptismal certificate as part of your application (as set out under the [
Education (Admission to Schools) Act 2018
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2018/act/14/enacted/en) ).

Keep a copy of your completed application form or letter, and copies of any
documents you submit with the application.

If you apply to a school mid-year or after the admissions period has passed,
the school should accept your child if they have a place available.

##  Step 5: Accept an offer

The school must reply to you in writing, to let you know whether your child
has been accepted or placed on a waiting list.

If you get an offer from the school, you must formally accept it. Schools
usually have a deadline by which you must accept their offer.

After you accept a place for your child, you must sign a declaration to state
that you accept the school’s behaviour policy and that you will do your best
to ensure your child complies with the policy.

If the school refuses your application to enrol your child, see ‘how to appeal
the decision’ below.

##  Step 6: Give additional documents to the school

The school might request documents from you to determine what class to put
your child in, or what level of support they need. They may ask for:

  * Copies of report cards 
  * Relevant assessments and reports of special educational needs 
  * A list of current textbooks and course outlines 
  * Results of standardised tests 
  * Examples or copies of your child’s latest classroom work 

The school also might request your child's immunisation records. This is so
your child can be included in the [ School Immunisation Programme
](https://www.hse.ie/eng/health/immunisation/pubinfo/schoolprog/) .

###  Exemption from learning Irish

Depending on how long your child has lived abroad, they may not have to study
Irish in school. You must apply to the school’s principal for [ the exemption
from Irish ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/education/the-irish-
education-system/exemption-from-irish/) and include proof of your child's age
and previous schooling.

##  How to appeal a decision

If a school refuses to enrol your child because they are over-subscribed, you
can ask the school’s board of management to review the decision. If the board
reviews the decision but your child still does not get a place, then you can
formally [ appeal the decision
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/education/the-irish-education-
system/admissions-policies-in-primary-and-secondary-schools#lc788f) .

You can also [ appeal to the Department of Education
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/education/the-irish-education-
system/admissions-policies-in-primary-and-secondary-schools/#dd86cf) if a
school refuses to admit your child for a reason other than the school being
oversubscribed.

##  I can’t find a school place

If a school tells you that your child is on a waiting list, ask where they are
on the waiting list and how you will be informed of any changes to their place
on the list.

If you cannot find a school place for your child, contact Tusla’s [
Educational Welfare Office ](https://www.tusla.ie/get-in-touch/education-and-
welfare/#EWO) in your area.
