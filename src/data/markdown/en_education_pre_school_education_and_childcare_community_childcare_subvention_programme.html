including the CCSP Saver Programme. If you are already on the CCSP Saver
Programme, you can choose to stay on this as long as you are eligible, or
until you transfer to another scheme.

childcare-subvention-plus-ccsp-and-training-and-employment-childcare-tec-
programme-rules-2020-2021/) helps disadvantaged parents and parents in
training, education or low-paid employment to get childcare at reduced rates.
