  * Boat licences 
  * Safety rules 
  * Certification and training 
  * Where to apply 

##  Introduction

Recreational boats in Ireland are regulated in different ways depending on
their size and what they are used for. This page describes how to get a boat
licence and whether you need one and covers the rules governing safety
equipment and radios on boats.

##  Boat licences

###  Passenger Boat Licence

A passenger boat is a boat that can carry up to 12 passengers. Passenger boats
need to get a [ Passenger Boat Licence
](http://www.dttas.ie/maritime/maritimesafetydirectorate/maritimesafety/passengerboats/passenger-
boats) . Smaller vessels that can carry up to 3 passengers may not need a
licence, see the [ Passenger Boat Regulations
](http://www.dttas.ie/maritime/english/passenger-boat-regulations-0) for more
information and exemptions.

A Passenger Boat Licence (including the passenger boat survey) costs €144.
Licences are valid for 2 years. The cost of renewal is €29. When you renew
your licence, you also need a renewal survey.

To apply for a Passenger Boat Licence you must complete a [ survey application
form ](https://assets.gov.ie/24771/6ddd9162959f45fcbbaf884d55d54b88.pdf) . See
_'Where to apply_ ' for more information.

###  Inland waterways

You do not need a licence if you are sailing your boat on an [ inland waterway
](https://www.waterwaysireland.org/places-to-go/) . However, you may need to
register your boat and get a permit on certain inland waterways if your boat
is over a certain size.

###  Passenger ship certificate

Passenger ships are vessels that can carry more than 12 passengers. Passenger
ships are required to get a [ Passenger Ship Certificate
](https://www.gov.ie/en/service/21fe88-apply-for-a-passenger-boat-licence/)
before they can operate.

When you apply for this certificate, you will also need a Passenger Ship
Survey. The fee for a Passenger Ship Survey is based on the vessel’s tonnage
or number of passengers. This is set out by the [ Merchant Shipping (Fees)
Regulations 2010
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2010/si/595/made/en/print) . Passenger
Ship Certificates are valid for 1 year. When you renew the certificate, you
must also carry out a renewal survey.

To apply for a passenger ship certificate you must complete a [ survey
application form
](https://assets.gov.ie/24771/6ddd9162959f45fcbbaf884d55d54b88.pdf) . See
_‘Where to apply’_ below for more information.

##  Safety rules

###  Safety rules for boats

All boats, regardless of size, must carry lifejackets (or personal flotation
devices) for everyone on board.

All passengers on board a boat or watercraft of less than 23 feet (7 metres)
in length must wear a lifejacket (or personal flotation device).

If your passenger ship is licensed to carry more than 12 people, it must pass
an annual safety inspection carried out by the Department of Transport.

###  Safety rules for pleasure crafts

Pleasure craft include motorboats, powerboats, fast powerboats and jet skis.

Every motorboat and powerboat (other than personal watercraft such as jet
skis) must have a suitable lifejacket for every person on board.

A suitable lifejacket is defined in the regulations as:

  * Sufficient to give a person using it a positive buoyancy in waters which are likely to be encountered where the vessel on which it is required to be used. 
  * Appropriate to the body weight of the person who is to wear it. 
  * Marked with the initials “CE”. 

Anyone using a jet ski must wear a lifejacket at all times. Anyone being towed
behind a motorboat or powerboat must also wear a lifejacket at all times.

Anyone under 16 years old, must wear a lifejacket at all times on all pleasure
craft. You must be 16 or over to operate or control a fast powerboat or a jet
ski.

Anyone under 12 years old, cannot operate or control any mechanically
propelled pleasure craft with an engine more powerful than 3.7 kilowatts.

If you are operating any type of pleasure craft, you must not consume alcohol
or drugs.

If you are a passenger on board any mechanically propelled pleasure craft, you
may only consume alcohol or drugs in a manner that does not affect safety or
cause a disturbance to the person in control of the craft.

The [ Code of Practice for the Safe Operation of Recreational Craft
](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/66ff7e-safe-operation-of-recreational-
craft/) provides all users with safety information, advice, and best
practices.

The above rules are set out by the [ Pleasure Craft (Personal Flotation
Devices and Operation) (Safety) Regulations 2005
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2005/en/si/0921.html) as amended by [
Pleasure Craft (Personal Flotation Devices and Operation) (Safety) (Amendment)
Regulations 2012 (S.I. No. 349 of 2012)
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2012/si/349/made/en/print) and further
amended by [ S.I. 400 of 2018
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2018/si/400/made/en/print) .

If you commit an offence under these regulations, you will receive a fine of
€150.

###  Safety rules for fishing boats

The use of safety equipment on fishing boats is regulated by the [ Fishing
Vessel (Personal Flotation Devices) Regulations, 2001
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2001/en/si/0586.html) as amended by [ S.I.
No. 401 of 2018 ](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2018/si/401/made/en/pdf)
.

Under these regulations, a lifejacket (or personal flotation device) must be
provided for every crew member on any fishing vessel registered and licensed
in Ireland.

The crew members must wear a lifejacket (or personal flotation device) at all
times when on an exposed deck or at all times on open vessels that do not have
internal accommodation. This applies equally whether the boat is at sea, in
harbour or coming to and from moorings.

Each lifejacket (or personal flotation device) should be marked with the
initials "CE". You can get more information on [ lifejackets and personal
floatation devices
](https://www.hsa.ie/eng/your_industry/fishing/further_information/lifejackets/#:~:text=Every%20lifejacket%20is%20a%20Personal,Be%20SOLAS%20approved.)
on the Health and Safety Authority website.

###  Radio licences

The Department of Transport is responsible for issuing radio licences for
boats. The licence lasts for the lifetime of the vessel and costs €100.

**Merchant ships:** Under the Merchant Shipping (Radio) Rules 1992, every
passenger ship or cargo ship of 300 Gross Tons or above is required to carry a
radio installation in compliance with the requirements of the Global Maritime
Distress and Safety System (GMDSS).

**Fishing vessels:** Under the Merchant Shipping Fishing Vessel (Radio
Installations) Regulations 1998, every registered fishing vessel must carry a
radio installation in compliance with the requirements of the Global Maritime
Distress and Safety System (GMDSS).

The radio installation must be capable of transmitting and receiving different
types of radio communications such as distress alerts and messages, urgency
and safety messages, meteorological information and public correspondence. In
addition, the installation must be capable of transmitting and receiving
locating signals.

The Maritime Radio Affairs Unit (MRAU), which is a unit within the Marine
Survey Office of the Department of Transport is responsible for the
implementation of these Rules and Regulations and is responsible for surveying
and inspecting radio installations and the issuing of Safety Radio
Certificates.

The MRAU may also survey or inspect Foreign Registered vessels and in such
cases, carries out these tasks in accordance with the standards of the [
Safety of Life at Sea Convention (SOLAS)
](https://www.imo.org/en/About/Conventions/Pages/International-Convention-for-
the-Safety-of-Life-at-
Sea-\(SOLAS\),-1974.aspx#:~:text=The%20main%20objective%20of%20the,ships%2C%20compatible%20with%20their%20safety.)
of the [ International Maritime Organization (IMO) ](http://www.imo.org/) .
Where a vessel is found to be contravention of any of the above Rules,
Regulations and standards and the deficiency is deemed by a Radio Surveyor to
have a potentially major impact on the safety of the vessel at sea, the
Surveyor has the power to detain the vessel until such time as the deficiency
is remedied.

###  Radio licence regulation

The licensing of maritime radio systems is regulated by the Wireless
Telegraphy Act, 1926. Every ship that has a radio system installed must also
carry a Ship Radio Licence.

While owners of recreational craft, (yachts, sail cruisers and motor cruisers
etc.) are not required to install a radio system, nevertheless if they opt to
install a radio system on a voluntary basis, they must also carry a Ship Radio
Licence on board.

Ship Radio Licences are issued by the MRAU. An applicant for a licence must
submit the technical details of the radio equipment installed on the vessel.
You [ apply online ](https://www.irishmaritimeradiolicencesystem.gov.ie/) .
See the [ FAQs for more information
](https://www.irishmaritimeradiolicencesystem.gov.ie/faqs) .

If you have a query about radio licence applications and EPIRB (Emergency
Position Indicating Radio Beacon) registration contact [
IMRAD@transport.gov.ie ](mailto:IMRAD@transport.gov.ie) . If you have a query
about radio operator certificates, contact [ admin@seafarers.ie
](mailto:admin@seafarers.ie) .

Every vessel that is equipped with radio equipment must also carry at least
one qualified marine radio operator. The qualification(s) of the operator(s)
depends on a number of factors, including the level of radio equipment
installed and the trading area of the vessel. Details of Ships Radio Licence
Training Course Providers are available from the Maritime Safety Directorate
in the Department of Transport.

###  Inland waterways

You do not need a licence if you are sailing your boat on an inland waterway,
but some waterways require you to be registered and/or to have a permit if
your boat is over a certain size.

[ Waterways Ireland ](https://www.waterwaysireland.org/things-to-do/boating;
/53/boat-registration-and-permits) is responsible for the enforcement of the
rules applying to the waterways under its remit.

##  Certification and training

The Department of Transport provides information on different certificates
required for operating certain marine radios, their syllabi or course content
and a list of course providers and radio examiners around the country.

[ Seafarers.ie ](https://www.seafarers.ie/Home) provides maritime education
and training in Ireland.

The Irish Sailing Association (ISA) is the national governing body
representing sailing, windsurfing, power-boating and personal watercraft in
Ireland. It advises on all aspects of boating safety and has a network of
teaching establishments that offer [ training for all leisure craft
](https://www.sailing.ie/Training/Training) in Ireland. This training includes
courses in how to operate dinghies, keelboats, catamarans, powerboats,
personal watercraft or jet skis and windsurf boards. There are also courses
offered in how to become a sea-based or shore-based 'Yachtmaster'.

The Irish Sailing Association provides information on all ISA-approved courses
run by sailing clubs, sailing schools and watersport centres around the
country.
