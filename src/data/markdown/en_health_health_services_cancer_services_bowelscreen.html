##  Introduction

BowelScreen is the National Bowel Screening Programme which offers free bowel
screening to people aged 59 to 69 every 2 years.

Bowel screening aims to detect signs of bowel cancer at an early stage, where
there are no symptoms.

####  How much does the test cost?

The test is free and is done by you at home. You need to be on the bowel
screening register to be sent an invitation to receive a home screening test
kit. See ‘ [ How to register for BowelScreen ](/en/health/health-
services/cancer-services/bowelscreen#lbfb48) ’ below.

Contact your GP if you have any [ symptoms of bowel cancer
](https://www2.hse.ie/conditions/bowel-
cancer/?gclsrc=aw.ds&gclid=Cj0KCQiAosmPBhCPARIsAHOen-
Mr3YAazmeDkwCVxjtiqdY1DLaAYyKfb25yIdOyYFz0gfQ9DwwotPwaAtxHEALw_wcB) . Never
ignore symptoms, even if you have had a recent normal screening result.

##  The BowelScreen test

You will be sent a screening test kit that includes step-by-step instructions
for self-administration of the test at home. The HSE will post the free test
to you.

You then send the completed test back to BowelScreen using the pre-paid
envelope provided. Your test results will be sent to you within 4 weeks. If
you have registered your GP details, they will also receive a copy of your
results.

If you [ get an abnormal result from your sample
](https://www2.hse.ie/screening-and-vaccinations/bowel-screening/bowel-
screening-information.html#after) , you’ll be offered a colonoscopy
appointment.

##  How to register for BowelScreen

Bowel cancer screening is available to all people aged 59 to 69 living in
Ireland.

BowelScreen puts together a register of people eligible for screening from
details supplied by the Department of Social Protection, General Medical
Services and private health insurance providers. However, some people are not
included on any of these lists.

If you haven’t received an invitation for bowel screening, you can [ check if
you are on the register online ](https://apps.bowelscreen.ie/bowel-
screening/verify-you-are-registered-with-
bowelscreen.609.cbsregistrationpublic.html?_ga=2.175137956.702499547.1642944254-1056890493.1611917890&_gac=1.249986548.1643304152.Cj0KCQiAosmPBhCPARIsAHOen-
