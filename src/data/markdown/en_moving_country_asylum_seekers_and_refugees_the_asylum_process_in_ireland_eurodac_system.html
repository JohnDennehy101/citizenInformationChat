##  Introduction

Eurodac is an EU database that stores the fingerprints of international
protection applicants or people who have crossed a border illegally. It is
used by the countries of the EU and also Norway, Iceland, Lichtenstein and
Switzerland.

The purpose of Eurodac is to give member states information to help them to
decide which country is responsible for a person’s [ international protection
application ](/en/moving-country/asylum-seekers-and-refugees/the-asylum-
process-in-ireland/international-protection-terms/) . If your fingerprint data
is stored on Eurodac because you previously applied for international
protection in another country, you may be returned to that country under the [
Dublin Regulations ](/en/moving-country/asylum-seekers-and-refugees/the-
asylum-process-in-ireland/dublin-convention/) .

Eurodac is equipped with a central database for comparing the fingerprints of
asylum applicants and a system for electronic data transmission between member
states and the database.

##  What information is stored by Eurodac?

In addition to fingerprints, data sent by member states include the member
state of origin (the state sending the data), the place and date of the
international protection application (if applicable), the person’s gender and
a reference number. Data is collected for anyone over 14 years of age and is
encoded directly into the database, either by the Central Unit or by the
member state of origin.

In the case of asylum seekers, data is kept for 10 years unless the individual
obtains the citizenship of one of the member states, when their particulars
are immediately erased. Data relating to foreign nationals apprehended when
attempting to cross an external border irregularly is kept for 2 years from
the date on which the fingerprints were taken. Data is immediately erased
before the end of 2 years if the foreign national either:

  * Receives a residence permit or 
  * Has left the territory of the member states 

In the case of foreign nationals found illegally present within a member
state, Eurodac makes it possible to check their fingerprints against those in
the central database to determine whether the individual had previously lodged
an international protection application in another member state. After the
fingerprints have been transmitted for comparison purposes, they are not
stored by Eurodac.

###  Data protection

The member state of origin must ensure that all operations are performed
lawfully, such as the taking of fingerprints, as well as all operations
involving the use, transmission, conservation or erasure of the data. The Data
Protection Commissioner is the [ national supervising authority
](https://www.dataprotection.ie/en/eurodac) in Ireland.

##  Application of Eurodac in Ireland

When you make an application for international protection, you and your
dependent minors will have your photograph taken. You will also have your
fingerprints taken. Fingerprints of your dependent minors may also be taken.
Your fingerprints may be disclosed in confidence to the relevant Irish
authorities and to international protection authorities of other countries.

You must allow your fingerprints to be taken. If you do not allow your
fingerprints to be taken, you may be detained.
