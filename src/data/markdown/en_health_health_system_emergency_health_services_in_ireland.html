  * Entitlement of visitors to Ireland to emergency health services 

##  Introduction

Emergency health services in Ireland provide medical attention for illnesses
or injuries requiring immediate treatment. Typical examples of injuries that
may require emergency health services include those resulting from accidents,
heart attacks or other sudden illnesses.

Emergency health services are usually delivered by a general practitioner
(GP), ambulance personnel or by attendance at the Accident and Emergency
Department of an acute hospital.

The Department of Health has overall responsibility for policy on accident and
emergency health services in Ireland. The Health Service Executive (HSE) has
responsibility for the delivery of public health emergency health services.  

##  Ambulance services

In the public health service, the National Ambulance Service provides
ambulance services for transporting seriously ill people to hospitals or
between hospitals. The Dublin Fire Brigade provides an emergency ambulance
service for the greater Dublin area.

These ambulance services are free, and you will not be charged by the National
Ambulance Service or the Dublin Fire Brigade.

You can contact emergency ambulance services by telephoning 999 or 112. (The
112 number applies throughout the EU). All calls are free.

If you are being brought to or from non-urgent healthcare, other vehicles may
be used if appropriate (for example taxis or minibuses). The Intermediate Care
Service provides vehicles for transport of patients between hospitals and
other medical facilities to ensure emergency ambulances are available to
respond to emergencies.

If you are using a private ambulance service, including air ambulance services
you will have to pay for their services. This may happen if you are
transferred to a private hospital. If you have private health insurance this
may help pay for some of the cost of the private ambulance.

There are also a number of volunteer ambulance organisations. They are
generally used to provide immediate assistance at public events.

The [ Pre-Hospital Emergency Care Council ](https://www.phecit.ie/) is the
national body with responsibility for the professional regulation of ambulance
personnel and for education and training in the area of pre-hospital emergency
care in Ireland.

##  Family doctor (GP) emergency care

If you wish to attend your family doctor (GP) as a result of an emergency you
can:

  * Attend at a surgery operated by your GP during specific hours. You can find out what these hours are by contacting your GP. 
  * Phone your GP and ask for them to visit you during the time set aside for house calls. 
  * Phone your GP outside normal hours â€“ the answering machine will usually indicate the number to ring in emergencies. This number may be a locum service or out-of-hours service. A locum service is one in which another doctor (not your GP) calls to the home of patients outside normal hours. 
  * Visit a GP out-of-hours co-operative. 

##  GP out-of-hours co-operatives

In parts of Ireland, GPs have come together to form co-operatives providing a
medical service outside normal working hours. These co-operatives receive
financial assistance from the State. The co-operative may be based in a health
centre, public hospital or in another location, often provided by the Health
Service Executive. Participating GPs provide this service on a rota basis in
the evenings, at weekends and on bank and public holidays.

Generally the service is available to the patients of the GPs participating in
the co-op. It is necessary to telephone a contact number to access the service
and the appropriate care may be telephone advice by a nurse or doctor. Care
may also include attendance at a treatment centre or a visit to your home by
the doctor on duty.

Medical card and GP visit card holders don't have to pay for the services
provided by the GP out-of-hours co-operatives. Other patients have to pay a
fee.

](http://www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/3/outofhours/GPOOH.html) .

##  Accident and Emergency Departments of public hospitals

Most public hospitals provide accident and emergency services. Anybody in
Ireland with a medical emergency is entitled to attend their Accident and
Emergency Departments. You may have to pay [ charges for public hospital
services ](/en/health/health-services/gp-and-hospital-services/hospital-
charges/) .

People attending the Accident and Emergency Department of a public hospital
are prioritised on the basis of medical need. You may be required to wait for
treatment if you have a non-urgent injury or illness.

Some hospitals have [ injury units for minor injuries
](https://www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/3/injuryunits/) that are unlikely to
require admission to hospital.

Some private hospitals and clinics offer emergency services. You will be
charged the full cost of care in private facilities.

##  Entitlement of visitors to Ireland to emergency health services

If you are a national of a member state of the European Union (EU), European
Economic Area (EEA), Switzerland or the UK and you are travelling or staying
temporarily in Ireland, you are entitled to receive medical care if you become
ill or have an accident.

See [ Health services for visitors to Ireland ](/en/health/health-
system/health-services-and-visitors-to-ireland/) for further information.

There is a [ reciprocal agreement on medical treatment for temporary visitors
between Ireland and Australia ](https://www.gov.ie/en/press-
release/0e0e58-reciprocal-agreement-on-medical-treatment-for-temporary-
visitors-bet/) . Under the agreement, Australian visitors who access emergency
public treatment pay the [ hospital charges ](/en/health/health-services/gp-
and-hospital-services/hospital-charges/) that apply to people who are
ordinarily resident in Ireland. If you are on a temporary visit to Ireland and
are not covered under EU regulations, you will have to pay the cost of
attendance at an Accident and Emergency Department. If you are not a national
of an EU/EEA member state, or from Switzerland or Australia, you may also be
charged the full economic cost of any further treatment, including medical
care in an acute hospital. Therefore taking out private medical travel
insurance before travelling is recommended.
