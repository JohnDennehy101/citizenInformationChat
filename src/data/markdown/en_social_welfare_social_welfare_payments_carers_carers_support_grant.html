##  What is the Carer's Support Grant?

The Carer’s Support Grant is paid to carers once a year by the Department of
Social Protection (DSP). It used to be called the Respite Care Grant.

You can use the grant in whatever way you like. You can use it to pay for
respite care, but you don't have to. Read our page about [ breaks and respite
care for carers ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/health/health-
services/health-services-for-people-with-disabilities/respite-care/) .

In June of each year (usually on the first Thursday of the month), the DSP
pays the grant automatically to carers getting:

  * [ Carer's Allowance ](/en/social-welfare/carers/carers-allowance/)
  * [ Carer's Benefit ](/en/social-welfare/carers/carers-benefit/)
  * [ Domiciliary Care Allowance ](/en/social-welfare/disability-and-illness/domiciliary-care-allowance/)

Only one Carer’s Support Grant can be paid for each person getting care.

The Carer’s Support Grant was paid on 6 June 2024.

##  Can I get the Carer's Support Grant?

The Carer’s Support Grant is paid automatically to people getting:

  * Carer’s Allowance (both full rate and half-rate) 
  * Carer’s Benefit 
  * Domiciliary Care Allowance. 

The Carer’s Support Grant is not a means-tested payment.

###  I don't get the payments listed above

If you are not getting one of these payments, you can still qualify for the
Carer’s Support Grant.

You must be:

  * Aged 16 or over 
  * Ordinarily resident in Ireland 
  * Caring for the person on a full-time basis 
  * Caring for the person for at least 6 months (this 6-month period must include the first Thursday in June) 
  * Living with the person being cared for (or [ if you don't live with them, you must meet certain criteria ](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/461f37-operational-guidelines-carers-support-grant/#definition-of-carer) \- for example, the person must be able to contact you quickly and directly) 

During this 6-month caring period, you cannot:

  * Work more than 18.5 hours per week (as an employee or in self-employment) 
  * Take part in an education or training course for more than 18.5 hours a week 
  * Get [ Jobseeker's Allowance ](/en/social-welfare/unemployed-people/jobseekers-allowance/) or [ Jobseeker's Benefit ](/en/social-welfare/unemployed-people/jobseekers-benefit/)
  * Sign on for [ credited contributions ](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/social-insurance-prsi/credited-social-insurance-contributions/)
  * Live in a hospital, convalescent home or similar institution 

###  Caring for more than one person

If you are caring for more than one person, a grant is paid for _each_ person
you care for.

###  Caring for a baby or child in hospital

If your baby or child is in hospital or other institution to get medical
treatment, you may qualify for the Carer’s Support Grant. To get the grant,
your baby or child must qualify for [ Domiciliary Care Allowance
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/social-welfare-
payments/disability-and-illness/domiciliary-care-allowance/) .

##  How much is the Carer's Support Grant?

In June 2024, the Carer's Support Grant was €1,850.

It is paid once a year for each person you are caring for. It was paid on 6
June 2024.

It is not taxable. Read about [ the taxation of social welfare payments
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-
system/claiming-a-social-welfare-payment/taxation-of-social-welfare-payments/)
.

##  How to apply

If you are getting Carer's Allowance, Carer's Benefit or Domiciliary Care
Allowance, you do not need to apply for the Carer's Support Grant. You will
automatically get it in June.

If you are not getting one of the above payments, you should fill in a [
Carer's Support Grant application form (pdf)
](https://assets.gov.ie/46552/3089ce6fa8d74561aad4c57dbdccd7ec.pdf) for each
person you are caring for.

  * [ Intreo Centre or Social Welfare Branch Office ](https://www.gov.ie/en/directory/category/e1f4b5-intreo-offices/) , or 
  * [ Citizens Information Centre ](http://centres.citizensinformation.ie/)

##  When to apply

that year until 31 December of the following year.
