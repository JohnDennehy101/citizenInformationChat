  * Further information 

##  What is the Rent Tax Credit?

If you pay rent, you may qualify for the Rent Tax Credit. [ The tax credit
reduces the income tax you owe by the amount of the credit
](../income_tax_credits_and_reliefs/introduction_to_income_tax_credits_and_reliefs.en.html#lb4129)
.

You can [ claim the tax credit ](rent_tax_credit.en.html#l98018) for rent
payments you made in 2022 or 2023 by [ making an income tax return
](rent_tax_credit.en.html#l98018) . You can also claim the tax credit for
payments made in 2024 if you are a [ PAYE taxpayer
](https://www.revenue.ie/en/jobs-and-pensions/what-is-paye/index.aspx) .

The Rent Tax Credit will be available for the years 2022 to 2025.

##  How much is the Rent Tax Credit?

The amount of the credit is 20% of your rent payments in the year, up to a
maximum credit of:

  * €750 for an individual 
  * €1,500 for a couple who are [ jointly assessed for tax ](../income_tax/taxation_of_married_people.en.html#l83f01)

If a smaller amount would reduce your income tax to zero, that amount is the
maximum credit you can get.

For 2022 and 2023, the credit was €500 for an individual and €1,000 for a
couple.

If a number of tenants pay the rent for a property, each individual or couple
can claim the Rent Tax Credit for the rent they pay.

You cannot claim for payments for:

  * A security deposit 
  * Repairs or maintenance 
  * Board, laundry, utilities or other services 

##  Can I claim the Rent Tax Credit?

You can claim the credit for rent payments you have made for:

  * Your home 
  * A second home in Ireland that you use to take part in your work or [ an approved course ](https://www.revenue.ie/en/personal-tax-credits-reliefs-and-exemptions/education/tuition-fees-paid-for-third-level-education/approved-colleges-and-courses.aspx)
  * A property that is used by your child to take part in [ an approved course ](https://www.revenue.ie/en/personal-tax-credits-reliefs-and-exemptions/education/tuition-fees-paid-for-third-level-education/approved-colleges-and-courses.aspx) , if they are under 23 at the start of the year in which they begin the course 

The rent payments must be for a home that is in Ireland.

You cannot claim for rent payments on a property that you get housing support
for, including:

  * [ The Housing Assistance Payment ](/en/housing/renting-a-home/help-with-renting/housing-assistance-payment/)
  * [ Rent Supplement ](/en/social-welfare/supplementary-welfare-schemes/rent-supplement/)
  * [ The Rental Accommodation Scheme ](/en/housing/local-authority-and-social-housing/rental-accommodation-scheme/)
  * [ Cost rental housing ](/en/housing/renting-a-home/help-with-renting/cost-rental-housing/)

This is the case even if you make a top-up payment in addition to the housing
support you get.

###  Registration of your tenancy

Your tenancy must be registered with the Residential Tenancy Board (RTB),
unless it is a type of tenancy where this is not required, called a [ licence
arrangement ](https://www.rtb.ie/register-a-tenancy/is-your-property-exempt-
from-registration-1) . This includes where you are [ sharing with the owner
](/en/housing/renting-a-home/tenants-rights-and-responsibilities/sharing-
accommodation-with-your-landlord/) in a [ rent-a-room ](/en/housing/owning-a-
home/home-owners/renting-a-room-in-your-home/) or digs arrangement.

In some cases, only the types of tenancies that are required to be registered
with the RTB are eligible for the credit, so rent-a-room or digs arrangements
are not included. This applies if:

  * You are related to your landlord or 
  * You are claiming for a property that is used by your child 

You can [ check the register with the RTB ](https://www.rtb.ie/check-register)
.

It was announced in [ Budget 2024 ](/en/money-and-tax/budgets/budget-2024/)
that this will change so that you will be able claim for rent for digs or
rent-a-room arrangements if you pay rent for your child who is attending an
approved course. This change will also apply retrospectively for 2022 and
2023.

If your tenancy is registered, the RTB has information on [ how to find the
Registered Tenancy (RT) number ](https://www.rtb.ie/beginning-a-tenancy/types-
of-tenancy-agreements-and-leases) . You will be asked for the RT number when
you apply for the tax credit. If you cannot provide the RT number when you
apply, Revenue may ask you for it later.

[ Find out more about registration of tenancies ](/en/housing/renting-a-
home/landlords-rights-and-responsibilities/registering-a-tenancy/) .

###  Your landlord

Your landlord must not be:

  * A housing association or approved housing body 
  * A local authority 
  * Your parent 
  * Your child 

If the property is used by your child to attend a course, the landlord cannot
be any relation to you or your child.

When you apply, you will be asked to provide information about your landlord
including:

  * Their name and address 
  * Their PPS number or Tax Reference number 
  * The property’s Local Property Tax number 

If your landlord prefers, they can give this information to Revenue directly
through [ myEnquiries ](https://www.revenue.ie/en/online-
services/services/manage-your-record/myenquiries.aspx) . They should also give
the Registered Tenancy number.
