#  Types of residence permission for non-EEA nationals

  * Introduction 
  * General types 
  * Special situations 

##  Introduction

If you are not a citizen of the [ European Economic Area (EEA) or Switzerland
](/en/government-in-ireland/european-government/european-union/european-
union/) , there are various types of residence rights or permission to remain
that allow you to live in Ireland. Permission to remain is granted by the
Department of Justice and Equality and consists of a special stamp endorsed on
your passport. This is usually called a residence stamp. The various types of
stamp and their meanings are covered in detail below.

You can read more about the general rules on residence in our document on [
residence rights for non-EEA nationals ](/en/moving-country/moving-to-
ireland/rights-of-residence-in-ireland/residence-rights-of-non-eea-nationals-
in-ireland/) . The Immigration Service Delivery (ISD) also publishes extensive
information on its website, [ https://www.irishimmigration.ie/
](https://www.irishimmigration.ie/) .

##  General types

###  Employment permit holders

If you have an [ employment permit ](/en/moving-country/working-in-
ireland/employment-permits/overview-employment-permits/) , you have permission
to remain in Ireland for as long as your employment permit is valid. You will
get a _stamp number 1_ on your passport. This stamp gives you permission to
remain on condition that you do not enter any employment unless you or your
employer have obtained an employment permit.

###  Investors and entrepreneurs

The [ Immigrant Investor Programme ](https://www.irishimmigration.ie/coming-
to-live-in-ireland/i-want-to-invest-in-ireland/) provided investment options
(with a minimum investment of €1 million) which allowed approved non-EEA
investors and their immediate family to enter Ireland on multi-entry visas and
to remain here for up to 5 years. **The Immigrant Investor Programme closed to
new applicants on 15 February 2023.** You can read [ 'frequently asked
questions' ](https://www.irishimmigration.ie/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/FAQs-
closure-of-IIP-Feb-2023-1.pdf) on the closure of the scheme and what it means
for existing projects and investors.

The [ Start-up Entrepreneur Programme
](https://www.irishimmigration.ie/coming-to-live-in-ireland/i-want-to-invest-
in-ireland/) allows non-EEA participants with an innovative business proposal
and funding or financial backing of at least €50,000 to come and set up a
business in Ireland. This scheme does not apply to retail, catering, personal
services or similar businesses.

Successful applicants to both programmes will be granted a residence
permission for 2 years initially. You can read more about [ coming to set up a
business or invest in Ireland ](/en/moving-country/working-in-ireland/migrant-
workers/coming-to-set-up-a-business-in-ireland/) .

###  Students

If you are a [ non-EEA national coming to study in Ireland ](/en/moving-
country/moving-to-ireland/studying-in-ireland/immigration-nonEEA-students/)
you must be enrolled in a full-time course on the [ Interim List of Eligible
Programmes (ILEP) ](https://www.irishimmigration.ie/coming-to-study-in-
ireland/frequently-asked-questions-for-students/) . If you are attending a
course on the ILEP you will have _stamp number 2_ endorsed on your passport.
You will be allowed to take up casual employment of up to 20 hours part-time
work per week in term time or up to 40 hours per week during holiday periods
(June to September and 15 December to 15 January). If you are not attending a
course on the Interim List of Eligible Programmes, you will not be entitled to
take up part-time work or engage in any business or profession. You will get
_stamp number 2A_ on your passport.

**Third Level Graduate Scheme:** Non-EEA students who have graduated with a
degree at level 8 or above from an Irish third-level institution and have a
current Certificate of Registration may be permitted to apply for the [ Third
Level Graduate Scheme ](https://www.irishimmigration.ie/my-situation-has-
changed-since-i-arrived-in-ireland/third-level-graduate-programme/) . This
scheme provides an extension of their permission to remain for 12 or 24 months
to allow them to seek employment and obtain a [ Critical Skills Employment
Permit ](/en/moving-country/working-in-ireland/employment-permits/green-card-
permits/) or [ General Employment Permit ](/en/moving-country/working-in-
ireland/employment-permits/work-permits/) . If they are granted permission to
remain, [ they will get stamp 1G
](https://www.irishimmigration.ie/registering-your-immigration-
permission/information-on-registering/immigration-permission-stamps/) .

###  Spouse or civil partner of an Irish national

If you are a non-EEA national married to, or in a [ recognised civil
partnership ](https://www.irishimmigration.ie/my-situation-has-changed-since-
i-arrived-in-ireland/spouse-civil-partner-of-irish-national-scheme/) with, an
Irish national **you do not have an automatic right to live in Ireland.**
Depending on your current immigration status, you apply for permission to live
in Ireland as follows:

  * If you **currently have permission** to live in Ireland, you should go with your Irish national spouse or civil partner to register with [ your local immigration officer ](https://www.irishimmigration.ie/registering-your-immigration-permission/frequently-asked-questions-for-registration/) as the spouse or civil partner of an Irish national. 

Or

  * If you **do not have permission** to live in Ireland, you must apply in writing to the Marriage to Irish National Section of the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service – see 'Where to apply' below. 

You can find [ details of the application procedures for spouses and civil
partners of Irish nationals on www.irishimmigration.ie
](https://www.irishimmigration.ie/my-situation-has-changed-since-i-arrived-in-
ireland/spouse-civil-partner-of-irish-national-scheme/) . Once you have
permission to live in Ireland on the basis of marriage or civil partnership
with an Irish national you may get a _stamp 4_ on your passport and you do not
need an employment permit or business permission.

###  EU Treaty Rights

If you are a non-EEA family member of an EEA or Swiss citizen, who meets the
requirements as laid out in the [ European Communities (Free Movement of
Persons) Regulations 2015,
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2015/si/548/made/en/print) you must apply
to the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service for permission to remain
under [ EU Treaty Rights ](https://www.irishimmigration.ie/coming-to-join-
family-in-ireland/joining-an-eea-or-swiss-national/eu-treaty-rights/) .

When you [ register with your local registration office ](/en/moving-
country/moving-to-ireland/rights-of-residence-in-ireland/registration-of-non-
eea-nationals-in-ireland/) the Certificate of Registration that you receive
will be a residence card with the wording 4 EU FAM (that is, the residence
card of a family member of an EU citizen). As a holder of this card 4 EU FAM,
you will be visa-exempt even if you are a visa-required national and you do
not need an employment permit or business permission.

###  De facto relationships

Non-EEA nationals who are in de facto relationships must have permission to
remain in the State. They can apply for a [ de facto partnership immigration
permission ](https://www.irishimmigration.ie/my-situation-has-changed-since-i-
arrived-in-ireland/de-facto-partner-of-an-irish-or-non-eea-national/) .

A non-EEA national whose partner is an Irish national or an Irish resident
must provide proof of cohabitation of at least 2 years. If the resident is a
non-EEA national, they must have a _stamp 1, 4_ or _5_ residence permission to
sponsor an application. Non-EEA nationals with _stamp 2_ or _3_ permission are
not eligible to be sponsors.

You can find the [ application form ](https://www.irishimmigration.ie/wp-
content/uploads/2021/05/application-for-permission-de-facto-partner.pdf) , the
guidelines for applicants, details of the evidence to be submitted and a list
of frequently asked questions on the website [ irishimmigration.ie
](https://www.irishimmigration.ie/my-situation-has-changed-since-i-arrived-in-
ireland/de-facto-partner-of-an-irish-or-non-eea-national/#faqs) .

ISD will not accept an application for de facto partnership immigration
permission if you are in Ireland on a [ short stay C visa
](https://www.irishimmigration.ie/coming-to-study-in-ireland/what-are-my-
study-visa-options/how-to-apply-for-a-short-c-visit-study-visa/) or the [
Irish Short Stay Visa Waiver Programme
](https://www.dfa.ie/media/dfa/alldfawebsitemedia/travel/info-note-short-stay-
visa-waiver-programme.pdf) .

If you intend to travel to Ireland on or after 1 November 2019 to join your de
facto partner who is an Irish national, you must have [ immigration
preclearance ](https://www.irishimmigration.ie/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Non-
EEA-De-Facto-Partners-of-Irish-Nationals.pdf) before you travel to Ireland.
This process applies to both non-visa required and visa required non-EEA
nationals. You can read about [ returning to Ireland with your de facto
partner ](/en/returning-to-ireland/residency-and-citizenship/returning-to-
ireland-with-your-de-facto-partner/) .

If you are a non-EEA national whose partner is an EU national (but not an
Irish national) you can apply for a [ residence card under EU Treaty Rights
](https://www.irishimmigration.ie/coming-to-join-family-in-ireland/joining-an-
eea-or-swiss-national/eu-treaty-rights/) if you have proof of living together
in a durable relationship of at least 2 years.

###  Visitors and others who are not allowed to work

If you are coming to Ireland as a visitor, a tourist, the spouse, partner or
dependant of an employment permit holder, or in order to receive medical
treatment, you will get a _stamp number 3_ on your passport. You will not be
entitled to work or engage in any business or profession while in Ireland. The
length of time that this stamp is valid will depend on your circumstances.

However, a spouse or de-facto partner of a [ Critical Skills Employment Permit
](/en/moving-country/working-in-ireland/employment-permits/green-card-
permits/) , General Employment Permit, Hosting Agreement or an Intra-Corporate
Transferee permit can get a Stamp 1G on their passport which allows them to
work. To get a Stamp 1G, you must be legally resident and granted permission
to live in Ireland under the Non-EEA Family Reunification Policy. Find out
more about [ employment permits and family members ](/en/moving-
country/working-in-ireland/employment-permits/spousal-work-permit-scheme/) .

[ Guidelines to the immigration arrangements for ministers of religion and lay
volunteers are on irishimmigration.ie

options-for-working-in-ireland/coming-to-work-for-more-than-90-days/minister-

.

##  Special situations

###  Doctors

All non-EEA doctors registering with their local immigration office on or
after 1 March 2014, whether for the first time or renewing their immigration
permission, must have an employment permit. Their stamp 1 immigration
permission will be for 6 months or 12 months subject to the duration of their
employment contract. Doctors who already have _stamp 4_ can have their stamp 4
renewed for 2 years. You can read about the [ immigration arrangements for
non-EEA doctors, including locum doctors, on irishimmigration.ie
](https://www.irishimmigration.ie/coming-to-work-in-ireland/what-are-my-work-
visa-options/applying-for-a-long-stay-employment-visa/atypical-working-
scheme/atypical-working-scheme-for-locum-hospital-doctors/) .

###  Stamp 0

The immigration permission stamp 0 is granted to people who are coming to
Ireland for a limited and specific stay. They must be self-sufficient and may
not get State benefits if they have stamp 0 permission. They include:

  * **Visiting academics:** They may work here for less than 9 months and must be paid from outside the State 
  * **Older dependent relatives:** The financial criteria to sponsor an older dependent relative are set out in Chapter 18 of the [ family reunification policy document (pdf) ](http://www.justice.ie/en/JELR/Family%20Reunification%20Policy%20Document.pdf/Files/Family%20Reunification%20Policy%20Document.pdf)
  * **Persons of independent means:** They must have an annual income of at least €50,000 and access to a lump sum to cover any unforeseen large expenses 

[ More information about the stamp 0 permission
](https://www.irishimmigration.ie/registering-your-immigration-
permission/information-on-registering/immigration-permission-stamps/) is
available on irishimmigration.ie.

###  Parents of Irish citizen children

Under the [ Irish Born Child Scheme (IBC/05)
](https://www.irishimmigration.ie/my-situation-has-changed-since-i-arrived-in-
ireland/irish-born-child-renewals/) non-EEA national parents of children born
in the State **prior to 1 January 2005** can apply for permission to remain
based on parentage of an Irish citizen child.

The European Court of Justice (ECJ) ruled in the Zambrano case [ C 34/09
](https://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document.jsf?text=&docid=80236&pageIndex=0&doclang=EN&mode=lst&dir=&occ=first&part=1&cid=3314741)
, that an EU member state may not refuse the non-EU parents of a dependent
child who is a citizen of, and resident in, an EU member state the right to
live and work in that member state. Non-EEA parents who meet the [ Zambrano
criteria ](http://www.inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/Pages/WP16000113) may be given [
permission to live and work in Ireland as the parent of an Irish citizen child
](https://www.irishimmigration.ie/my-situation-has-changed-since-i-arrived-in-
ireland/the-parent-of-an-irish-citizen-child/) .

###  Victims of domestic violence

Some foreign nationals who are victims of domestic violence may currently have
an immigration status which is dependent on the person carrying out the
domestic violence. In these cases the foreign national may apply for
independent immigration status as a victim of domestic violence. You can read
the [ immigration guidelines for victims of domestic violence (pdf)
](https://www.irishimmigration.ie/my-situation-has-changed-since-i-arrived-in-
ireland/immigration-guidelines-for-victims-of-domestic-violence/) .

###  Victims of human trafficking

A non-EEA national who has been identified as a suspected [ victim of human
trafficking ](/en/justice/crime-and-crime-prevention/human-trafficking/) may
be granted permission to remain in Ireland for up to 60 days. In certain cases
such a non-EEA national may be granted further periods of temporary residence
in Ireland.

The person must have been identified as a suspected victim by a superintendent
or higher-ranked Garda in the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB). Full
details are in [ Administrative Immigration Arrangements for the Protection of
Victims of Human Trafficking (pdf)
](http://www.inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/Administrative%20Immigration%20Arrangements%20for%20the%20Protection%20of%20Victims%20of%20Human%20Trafficking%20-%20March%202011.pdf/Files/Administrative%20Immigration%20Arrangements%20for%20the%20Protection%20of%20Victims%20of%20Human%20Trafficking%20-%20March%202011.pdf)
