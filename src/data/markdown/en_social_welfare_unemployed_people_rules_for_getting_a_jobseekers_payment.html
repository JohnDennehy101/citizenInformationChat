##  Jobseeker’s payments

[ Jobseeker’s Benefit ](/en/social-welfare/unemployed-people/jobseekers-
benefit/) and [ Jobseeker’s Allowance ](/en/social-welfare/unemployed-
people/jobseekers-allowance/) are payments for people who are unemployed and
looking for work.

To get Jobseeker’s Benefit (JB), you must have enough social insurance (PRSI)
contributions. To get Jobseeker’s Allowance (JA), you must pass a means test.
You can find out more about [ the difference between JB and JA ](/en/social-
welfare/unemployed-people/signing-on/) .

To get either of these jobseeker’s payments, you’ll need to be capable of
work, available for work and looking for full-time work or your payment can be
reduced or stopped.

##  Rules for getting a jobseeker's payment

To qualify for a jobseeker’s payment, you must be 18 years or over and under
66 years of age.

You must meet certain PRSI conditions to get [ Jobseeker's Benefit (JB)
](/en/social-welfare/unemployed-people/jobseekers-benefit/) . You must pass a
means test and habitual residency conditions for [ Jobseeker's Allowance (JA)
](/en/social-welfare/unemployed-people/jobseekers-allowance/) .

For JA and JB, you must also be:

  * Unemployed (you must be fully unemployed or unemployed for at least 4 days out of 7) 
  * Capable of work 
  * Available for work 
  * Genuinely seeking work 

While you are getting a jobseeker’s payment, you must attend meetings and take
part in appropriate employment schemes, training, or work experience if
requested by the Department of Social Protection (DSP). See ‘Sanctions for not
meeting the jobseeker’s payment rules’ below.

###  Unemployed

To get a jobseeker’s payment you must be unemployed for at least 4 days out of
7. This means that you can work for up to 3 days in a 7-day period and still
qualify for a jobseeker’s payment for the days you are not working. You can
also take up to [ 2 weeks’ holiday in a year ](/en/social-welfare/irish-
social-welfare-system/claiming-a-social-welfare-payment/going-abroad-and-
social-welfare-payments/) and continue to get your payment.

If you work 36 hours or more in a week, you will be treated as being in full-
time employment. However, people who work a lower number of hours (perhaps as
low as 30 hours, depending on the job) in a week may also be treated as being
in full-time employment. People in full-time employment do not qualify for a
jobseeker’s payment.

###  Part-time work

If you can only find part-time work or if your employer reduces your days at
work to 3 days a week or less, you may get a jobseeker’s payment for the other
days. You must meet the other conditions that apply to the payment, for
example, you must continue to look for full-time work. In the case of
Jobseeker’s Allowance, any income from work is assessed in the means test.

Read about:

  * [ Jobseeker’s Allowance and work ](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/means-test-for-social-welfare-payments/work-and-jobseekers-allowance/)
  * [ Jobseeker’s Benefit and work ](/en/social-welfare/social-welfare-payments-and-work/jobseekers-benefit-and-work/)
  * [ Benefit of Work Estimator ](https://www.mywelfare.ie/benefitofworkjsestimator)

###  Retained firefighters and jobseeker’s payments

If you are employed as a part-time retained firefighter, you may qualify for a
jobseeker’s payment. If you are working as a part-time fire fighter, you do
not have to sign off for the days you are on call, firefighting or training.
This means that you can be paid a jobseeker’s payment for days that you are on
call, firefighting, or training.

Retained firefighters must live within 2.4 kilometres (1.5 miles) of the fire
station and commit to being ready for firefighting duties in 5 minutes. This
requirement is not considered a restriction on your availability for work, so
long as you are satisfying the conditions of the scheme. You have to be
available for full-time work and you must not restrict your search for
employment to the 2.4km limit.

If you are getting Jobseeker’s Allowance, the income you get will be assessed
in the normal way and any means will be set against your payment.

If you had a previous Jobseeker’s Benefit claim, you can requalify for JB once
you pay 13 PRSI contributions and you meet all the other conditions. The
substantial loss condition does not apply to the employment as a firefighter.
However, if you have other employment, then the substantial loss condition
applies to that other employment.

###  Voluntary work

You may be able to do voluntary work and continue to get a jobseeker’s
payment. You must continue to satisfy the conditions of the payment, which
means that you must be available and looking for full-time work. You must also
get permission from a Deciding Officer at your Intreo Centre or Social Welfare
Branch Office. Find out more about [ voluntary work and social welfare
payments ](/en/social-welfare/voluntary-work-and-social-welfare-payments/) .

###  On strike

If you are on strike, you are not considered unemployed and will not get a
jobseeker’s payment. However, if you are out of work as a result of a strike
(for example, you have been laid off because of the strike), you may get a
jobseeker’s payment. You may get a jobseeker’s payment if you are "not
participating in or directly interested in the trade dispute which caused the
stoppage at work". If you are on strike, your family may get [ basic
Supplementary Welfare Allowance ](/en/social-welfare/supplementary-welfare-
schemes/supplementary-welfare-allow/) .

###  Capable of work

You must be capable of work to qualify for a jobseeker’s payment. You are
considered capable of work unless you can produce medical evidence to prove
that you are not able to work. If you have spent some time incapable of work,
you must produce a final medical certificate to prove that you are now fit for
work.

If you are ill and incapable of work, you may be entitled to [ Disability
Allowance ](/en/social-welfare/disability-and-illness/disability-allowance/)
or [ Illness Benefit ](/en/social-welfare/disability-and-illness/illness-
benefit/) . If you are pregnant, you are considered to be capable of work
unless you have complications during your pregnancy or you are ill. You can
read more in our page on [ pregnancy and social welfare payments ](/en/social-
welfare/families-and-children/pregnancy-and-social-welfare-payments/) .

###  Available for work

You are considered available for work if:

  * You state that you are available for work 
  * You do all that is asked to show compliance with this availability condition 
  * There is no evidence you are not available for work 

The Department of Social Protection considers that you are available for work
if you are prepared to accept any offers of suitable employment immediately.
In addition, the employment must be suitable, having regard to your age, sex,
physique, education, normal occupation, where you live, rate of pay offered
and your family circumstances.

However, you can be regarded as not being available for work and therefore not
entitled to a jobseeker’s payment if you put unreasonable restrictions on the
following:

  * The nature of the employment 
  * The hours of work 
  * The rate of pay 
  * The duration of the employment 
  * The location of the employment 

If a Deciding Officer thinks that you have placed unreasonable restrictions,
you will be interviewed and given the opportunity to respond. Note that if you
refuse a suitable offer of work, you can be disqualified from a jobseeker’s
payment.

For example, you are considered unavailable for work in the following
circumstances:

  * You are looking for a particular type of work only. 
  * You state that you are looking for part-time work only. However, if you cannot get suitable full-time employment, you can still accept part-time work. 
  * You are only available during hours which are not typical of the employment you are looking for, for example, looking for clerical office work in evenings only. 
  * You are unwilling to take up an offer of reasonable short-time employment, for example, relief work or employment under a short-term contract. 
  * You move to a location where your prospects of getting suitable employment are significantly reduced. However, the reasons for the move will be taken into account. 
  * You are placing unreasonable restrictions on the distance which you are willing to travel to find work. However, access to public and private transport is taken into account. 
  * You may also be asked about your responsibilities at home, for example, who is looking after your child dependents. This question must be asked all applicants. 

If you are looking after a sick or older person and are not available for work
you may be entitled to a [ carer’s payment ](/en/social-
welfare/carers/payments-to-carers/) .

You can read more about the 'available for work' condition in the Department
of Social Protection’s guidelines for [ Jobseeker's Allowance
](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/1a5134-operational-guidelines-jobseekers-
allowance/#qualifying-conditions) and [ Jobseeker's Benefit
](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/e95f88-operational-guidelines-jobseekers-
benefit/#available-for-full-time-work) .

###  Genuinely looking for work

You must also show that you are genuinely looking for work. A day is not
treated as a day of unemployment unless on that day you are genuinely seeking
suitable full-time work. If you are in part-time employment and getting a
jobseeker's payment, you must show that you are trying to get full-time
employment on the days you are not working.

You must be able to show that you are making genuine efforts to secure
employment. You need to provide examples seeking work. Steps which show that
you are genuinely seeking work may include:

  * Making oral or written applications for work 
  * Looking for information on the availability of employment from employers, advertisements, and employment agencies 
  * Taking up reasonable training opportunities 
  * Acting on the advice given by a DSP Case Officer or other placement agency, such as the Local Employment Service (LES) 
  * Taking positive, well-advised steps towards establishing yourself in self-employment, such as researching possible areas of self-employment 
  * Preparing business plans for a self-employment project 
  * Attending relevant "start your own business" courses or seeking information, advice or guidance in relation to any of these steps 

You can read more about the 'genuinely looking for work' condition in the
Department of Social Protection's guidelines for [ Jobseeker's Allowance
](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/1a5134-operational-guidelines-jobseekers-
allowance/#qualifying-conditions) and [ Jobseeker's Benefit
](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/e95f88-operational-guidelines-jobseekers-
benefit/#available-for-full-time-work) .

##  Sanctions for not meeting the jobseeker’spayment rules

You can be _refused_ a jobseeker’s payment if you do not meet all the rules
that apply to the payment. You can be _disqualified_ from a payment for a
period of time in certain circumstances. You can also have your _payment
reduced_ (and subsequently stopped altogether for a period of time) if you do
not attend meetings or participate in appropriate employment schemes, training
or work experience.

###  Disqualification from a jobseeker’s payment

You may be disqualified from getting a jobseeker’s payment for up to 9 weeks
if you:

  * Left work voluntarily and without just cause 
  * Lost your job through misconduct 
  * Refused or failed to engage with activation measures where a penalty rate applied (see below) 

You can be disqualified from Jobseeker’s Benefit if you are aged under 55 and
get a redundancy payment of more than €50,000. The exact length of your
disqualification (up to 9 weeks) will depend on the amount of redundancy
payment you get.

You can also be disqualified from a jobseeker’s payment if you do not co-
operate with the [ Department’s identity checking procedures for issuing you
with a Public Services Card ](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-
system/public-services-card/) .

You can [ appeal a decision to disqualify you from a payment
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-
system/social-welfare-appeals/) to the Social Welfare Appeals Office.

###  Reduction in payment

Depending on your personal profile, you may be given an appointment for a
further meeting with a DSP Case Officer. At this meeting your Case Officer
will discuss your options with you and agree your Personal Progression Plan to
prepare you to find employment. You will get ongoing advice and support to
help you meet the goals in your Personal Progression Plan. You can read about
the [ employment services the Department of Social Protection offers to
jobseekers ](/en/social-welfare/unemployed-people/employment-supports/) .

If you do not keep to the other conditions of your jobseeker’s payment, your
payment can be reduced and eventually stopped altogether.

You can be paid a _penalty rate_ of JA or JB if you do not:

  * Attend meetings requested by the DSP or 
  * Participate in an appropriate employment support scheme, work experience or training 

If you have been placed on a penalty rate and you continue not to meet the
rules, you can be disqualified from your jobseeker’s payment for up to 9
weeks. You cannot be disqualified immediately – a penalty rate must apply
first for at least 21 days.
