##  The Register of Political Parties

Candidates at elections who are members of a registered political party can
add their party’s name to their own name on the ballot paper.

If the party that you belong to is not a registered political party, you are
described as a _non-party candidate_ on the ballot paper.

[ An Coimisiún Toghcháin ](/en/government-in-ireland/elections-and-
referenda/voting/electoral-commission/) (the Electoral Commission) is
responsible for the Register of Political Parties. Its Chief Executive is the
Registrar.

Under [ Section 43 of the Electoral Reform Act 2022
](https://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2022/act/30/section/43/enacted/en/html)
, you can apply to registrar your own political party in any of the following
elections in Ireland:

  * Dáil elections 
  * European elections 
  * Local elections 

##  Criteria for registration

To register a political party, you must satisfy the Registrar that your party
is organised to contest elections.

You can register a party’s name and an emblem.

You can register a political party to contest all elections or to contest only
local elections. Different rules apply if you want to register to contest
local elections only.

The [ Register of Political Parties
](https://www.electoralcommission.ie/publications/register-of-political-
parties/) is available online. Anyone can inspect the complete Register of
Political Parties by contacting [ An Coimisiún Toghcháin ](/en/government-in-
ireland/elections-and-referenda/voting/electoral-commission/) (the Electoral
Commission).

Candidates from unregistered parties can run in elections, but the party's
name will not appear on the ballot paper.

###  Number of party members or elected representatives

|  **Either** |  **Or**  
---|---|---  
**All elections** |  At least 300 recorded members  |  One TD or MEP at the time of registration   
**Local elections only** |  At least 100 recorded members  |  3 councillors at the time of registration   
  
Members must be 18 or over and at least half of them must be [ registered to
vote ](/en/government-in-ireland/elections-and-referenda/voting/registering-
to-vote/) .

You can register a party to contest an election in a particular region of
Ireland only (for example, a party campaigning for extra local services). In
this case, you need to have at least 100 members.

###  Constitution and administration

In addition, the party must have a constitution, a memorandum or another
document or set of rules that have been adopted by the party and that provide
for:

  * An annual or other periodic meeting or conference of the party 
  * An executive committee or similar body elected by the party, which administers the business of the party. 

###  Other rules for registration

A party will not be registered if its name:

  * Is identical to the name, abbreviation or acronym of the name of any registered party or so closely resembles the name, abbreviation or acronym of the name of a party as to be likely to confuse the public 
  * Consists of more than 6 words 

In the case of a party operating in a particular part of the country, the name
must make it clear that it only operates in that area.

###  Party emblems

An application to register a political party emblem will not be granted if the
emblem:

  * Is likely to be confused by voters with a registered emblem used by another party 
  * Is obscene or offensive 
  * Is of such a character that its publication would be likely to amount to the commission of an offence 
  * Includes a word or expression, which if it was or was part of the party's name, would prevent the party from being registered. 

##  Information for the Register of Political Parties

The following details are entered in the Register of Political Parties:

  * The name of the party, including any abbreviation or acronym 
  * The emblem, if an application for its registration has been granted 
  * The address of the party's headquarters 
  * The name or names of the officer or officers of the party who are authorised to sign certificates authenticating the party's candidates at elections 
  * The type or types of election that the party is registered as being organised to contest 
  * Where the party is registered as organised to contest elections in a specified part of Ireland, a reference to that fact and to the part of the country concerned 
  * The name of any political group with which the party is affiliated 
  * The name and address of each accounting unit (for example, branch) of the political party and the name and address of the person (for example, treasurer) who is responsible for dealing with donations   

##  Registration refusals and appeals

When the Registrar has considered your application for registration, you will
be notified of the decision. If the application is refused, the Registrar will
inform you of the reasons for refusal and details of how to appeal the
decision.

Notices of decisions are published in [ Iris Oifigiúil
](https://www.irisoifigiuil.ie/) (the Irish Government official gazette).

Appeals must be lodged within 21 days of the publication of the decision in
Iris Oifigiúil, to the Chairperson of the Electoral Commission together with a
deposit of €500.

The deposit is returned to the person making the appeal unless the appeal
board decides that the appeal was frivolous (not serious) or vexatious
(intended to cause annoyance).

Parties ](https://ec-cdn-live.s3.eu-
