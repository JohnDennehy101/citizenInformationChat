#  Rounding of cash transactions

  * Introduction 
  * Rules 
  * Further information 

##  Introduction

Rounding was introduced for cash transactions in Ireland in 2015. Rounding
means that the total amount of a bill will be rounded up or down to the
nearest 5 cent.

It applies only to cash payments and does not apply to bills paid
electronically, for example, by debit card, credit card or by store card.

Rounding aims to reduce the need for 1 and 2 cent coins which cost more to
produce than they are worth. However, 1 and 2 cent coins will continue to be
legal tender.

Rounding is voluntary for retailers and customers. The retailer can apply
rounding automatically without asking you but you can choose not to have
rounding applied and use exact change.

##  Rules

If a bill total is being paid in cash and the number of cent does not end in
zero or 5, the amount of change paid will be rounded to the nearest 5 or 10
cent:

  * 1 or 2 is rounded down to zero 
  * 3 or 4 is rounded up to 5 
  * 6 or 7 is rounded down to 5 
  * 8 or 9 is rounded up to 10 

####  Examples

A bill total of:

  * €10.21 or €10.22 would be rounded to €10.20 
  * €10.23 up to €10.27 would be rounded to €10.25 
  * €10.28 or €10.29 would be rounded to €10.30 

For 3 individual items priced at €2.99, €4.49 and €8.18, the prices will be
added together and the total bill (€15.66) would be rounded down to €15.65.
