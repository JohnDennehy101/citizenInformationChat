##  Introduction

If you live in Ireland ( [ are ordinarily resident ](/en/health/health-
system/entitlement-to-public-health-services/) ), you can get free or
subsidised approved prescribed drugs, medicines and certain medical and
surgical aids and appliances.

You can get some drugs and medicines without a prescription such as [
emergency contraception ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/health/health-
services/reproductive_health/contraception/#24d4cc) (morning-after pill) and
treatments for conditions including:

  * Colds 
  * Pain relief 
  * Hay fever 
  * Rashes 
  * Temperatures 

These are sometimes called over-the-counter medicines.

##  Getting a prescription

If you need specific drugs and medicines, certain healthcare professionals can
give you a prescription for them, such as a GP, a consultant, a dentist or a
nurse.

A nurse must be employed by a health service provider to be able to give you a
prescription. Nurses can only prescribe drugs and medicines relevant to the
area they work in. There are specific restrictions on certain controlled
drugs.

GPs and specialists can email prescriptions to pharmacists.

##  How long is my prescription valid for?

If your prescription was issued before 1 March 2024, it is only valid for a
maximum of 6 months.

From 1 March 2024, you may get a prescription that is valid for up to 12
months from your doctor or other prescriber.

From September 2024, you may ask your pharmacist to extend your 6-month
prescription if you got it on 1 March 2024 or after.

###  Pharmacist extension of prescriptions

If your prescription was issued **before 1 March 2024** , the maximum legal
validity of your prescription is 6 months. Pharmacists may extend
prescriptions for up to 3 months if they think it safe and appropriate

If your 6-month prescription is dated **1 March 2024 or later,** a pharmacist
may extend this prescription to 12 months in total.

This means that from 1 September 2024, if you have a 6-month prescription you
can request an extension to if from your pharmacist if it is dated from 1
March 2024.

Prescriptions written after 1 March 2024 for other periods cannot be extended
by a pharmacist.

So, when your 6-month prescription is due to end you can ask your pharmacist
to extend it. This means that you may not need to visit your doctor for a
repeat prescription.

However, extensions will not be automatically granted. Your pharmacist will
use their clinical judgement to decide if it is safe to extend your
prescription.

Certain medications will not be eligible for prescription extension.

[ Read more about these changes on gov.ie.
](https://www.gov.ie/en/campaigns/87eb1-pharmacy-services/)

##  Where to get prescription drugs and medicines

###  Pharmacy (also called a chemist)

You can get your prescribed drugs and medicines in a retail pharmacy
(chemist's shop). [ Find your local pharmacy
](https://registrations.thepsi.ie/search-register/) . Most pharmacies have
agreements with the Health Service Executive (HSE) to provide services under
the [ Primary Care Reimbursement Services scheme ](/en/health/health-
system/general-medical-services-payments-board/) .

###  Other providers

You may be given medicines, drugs, aids or appliances as part of your
treatment in hospital or in another healthcare facility.

GPs may give drugs and medicines directly to patients if the GP has only one
practice centre and it is three miles or more from the nearest retail
pharmacist. Doctors who give drugs and medicines under these arrangements are
sometimes called _dispensing doctors_ .

The rules about when drugs and medicines are free or subsidised are the same
regardless of who provides them.

####  Approved drugs and medicines

Drugs and medicines must be approved and controlled before they can be sold.
The [ Health Products Regulatory Authority ](http://www.hpra.ie/) (HPRA) tests
drugs and medicines for safety, quality and efficacy and provides licenses.
HPRA approval does not mean that the drugs and medicines will be approved for
the free and subsidised schemes. There are other factors involved in the
approval process, including costs.

##  Free or subsidised schemes

The HSE Primary Care Reimbursement Service (PCRS) provides a [ list of
medicines or aids provided under the medical card or Drugs Payment Scheme
](http://www.hse.ie/eng/staff/PCRS/items/) . These products are approved for
the schemes by the HSE.

Some items that can be bought over the counter are not included in the free or
subsidised schemes.

###  Medical card

If you have a [ medical card ](/en/health/medical-cards-and-gp-visit-
cards/medical-card/) , drugs and medicines prescribed for you are discounted.
You will still need to pay some [ prescription charges ](/en/health/drugs-and-
medicines/prescription-charges-for-medical-card-holders/) .

###  Long Term Illness Scheme

If you have certain conditions, you may be able to apply for the [ Long Term
Illness Scheme ](/en/health/drugs-and-medicines/long-term-illness-scheme/) .
Under the scheme, you can get free drugs, medicines and medical and surgical
appliances for the treatment of that condition.

###  Health Amendment Act Card

If you contracted Hepatitis C directly or indirectly through the
administration of blood products or transfusions, you can get drugs and
medicines using the [ Health Amendment Act Card ](/en/health/health-
services/blood-and-organ-donation/hepatitis-c-and-health-amendment-act-cards/)
.

###  Drugs Payment Scheme

If you are not eligible for any of the schemes listed above and do not have a
medical card, you can register for the [ Drugs Payment Scheme
](/en/health/drugs-and-medicines/drugs-payment-scheme/) which limits the
monthly cost of prescription medicines.

###  Discretionary Hardship Scheme

If you have a medical card and are prescribed an item that is not on the PCRS
list, your pharmacist or Local Health Office can apply for it to be paid for
by the Discretionary Hardship Scheme.

If the hardship scheme does not cover the cost of the medicine and you have to
pay for it, you may want to check with your doctor to see if there is an
alternative medicine. You can get more information about the scheme from your
pharmacist or [ Local Health Office
](https://www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/1/lho/) .

###  Tax relief

You can claim [ tax relief on medical expenses ](/en/money-and-tax/tax/income-
tax-credits-and-reliefs/taxation-and-medical-expenses/) for prescribed drugs
and medicines.

##  Generic drugs and reference pricing

Sometimes the pharmacist may give you a different brand name of the medicine
you are prescribed. This is because there is a less expensive version of the
brand name medicine called a generic version. The pharmacist is allowed do
this if the medicines are included in the [ list of interchangeable drugs
published by the HPRA ](http://www.hpra.ie/homepage/medicines/special-
topics/generic-and-interchangeable-medicines/list-of-interchangeable-
medicines) . The list includes all medicines which can be substituted for one
another.

The HPRA has published an [ information leaflet about generic medicines (pdf)
](http://www.hpra.ie/docs/default-source/publications-forms/information-
leaflets/generic-medicines_web.pdf?sfvrsn=4) .

####  Reference pricing

The HSE sets one price that it will pay for each group of the generic
medicines on the approved list. This is known as the [ reference price
](https://www.sspcrs.ie/druglist/pub) .

If you have a [ medical card ](/en/health/medical-cards-and-gp-visit-
cards/medical-card/) , the HSE will pay the reference price for any generic
medicine. If you choose to buy the more expensive brand of the medicine, you
must pay the difference between the reference price and the retail price.

If you are on the [ Drugs Payment Scheme ](/en/health/drugs-and-
medicines/drugs-payment-scheme/) , the HSE will use the reference price to
calculate your monthly drugs costs. If you choose a more expensive brand of a
[ medicine that is covered ](https://www.hse.ie/eng/staff/pcrs/items/) under
the Scheme, you must pay the extra cost.

If you need a particular brand of medicine for medical reasons, your doctor
can write 'Do not Substitute' on the prescription. If you have a medical card,
you pay the prescription charge and do not have to pay the difference between
the reference price and the retail cost. If you have a Drugs Payment Scheme
Card, you pay up to the monthly threshold as normal.
