##  Our Story

Welcome to A Little Lifetime Foundation ( formerly isands - irish stillbirth
and neonatal death society) which was founded in 1983 by a group of bereaved
parents who searched for support after their baby died. At A Little Lifetime
Foundation, we understand the profound impact of such loss and are dedicated
to providing compassionate assistance to those who need us.

Our mission is to empower families to navigate the grieving process with
dignity and resilience. Through our programs, support groups, and online
resources, we strive to create a safe and nurturing environment where
individuals can find solace and connection.

##  How We Help You

  * ###  **Emotional Support**

A Little Lifetime Foundation provides compassionate emotional support to those
affected by baby loss. Through one to one counselling, support groups,
creative workshops and remembrance services we offer a safe space for
individuals to express their grief, share experiences, and find understanding
and empathy.

  * ###  **Making Decisions in a Time of Grief**

We understand that the days and weeks following the loss of your baby can be
overwhelming and brings with it many difficult choices.Our information pack is
designed to support you through these decisions with clear explanations and
resources. We cover topics such as what to expect physically after childbirth,
spending time with your baby and creating precious memories, ways to honour
your baby, options for funerals and memorial services and understanding the
process and benefits of a post-mortem

  * ###  **Awareness and Advocacy**

A Little Lifetime raises awareness about stillbirth and neonatal loss through
educational campaigns, public events, and engagement with policymakers,
continuously striving to break the silence and stigma surrounding babyloss.
