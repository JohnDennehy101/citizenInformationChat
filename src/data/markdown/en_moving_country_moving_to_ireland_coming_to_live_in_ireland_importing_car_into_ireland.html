##  Introduction

If you are moving to Ireland, you may decide to bring your vehicle with you.
You must register the vehicle in Ireland and you may have to pay additional
charges and taxes. You can find more information on our page about [ bringing
your vehicle to Ireland ](/en/returning-to-ireland/planning-your-journey-
home/bringing-your-vehicle-back-to-ireland/) .

If you live in Ireland and decide to buy a car from another country, you
should check all the extra costs that are involved in registering and taxing
the vehicle in Ireland.

This page guides you on the steps involved to bringing a vehicle and
registering it in Ireland if you are doing it for yourself, rather than using
a car dealer.

Revenue provides detailed information about [ importing a vehicle to Ireland
](https://www.revenue.ie/en/vrt/index.aspx) .

##  Types of vehicles

There are many different types of motorised vehicle. For the purposes of
Vehicle Registration a _vehicle_ is:

  * Designed for road use 
  * Powered by mechanical or electrical means (or a combination of both) 

The following are types of mechanically propelled vehicles and their VRT
categories:

**Vehicle classification** |  **VRT category**  
---|---  
All cars, including SUVs  Mini bus with up to 10 seats  |  A   
Commercial vehicles like vans and trucks up to 3.5 tonnes  |  B   
Commercial vehicles like vans and trucks, over 3.5 tonnes  Tractors  Buses with more than 10 seats  |  C   
Road construction transportation vehicles  Ambulances and fire engines  |  D   
Motorbikes  |  M   
  
Other types of vehicles may be classified as mechanically propelled for VRT,
depending on certain factors.

Ebikes or battery powered scooters are mechanically propelled if they can move
without you pedalling or scooting them. If the power only works after you have
got the scooter or bike moving by cycling or scooting it, it is not classed as
mechanically propelled.

##  Importing a vehicle from the UK

If you decide to buy a new or used car from the United Kingdom (UK) directly
(not through a dealer in Ireland), you must arrange to pay the additional
charges yourself.

You must pay:

  * A customs duty if the vehicle is arriving from Great Britain, and not Northern Ireland (see ‘Customs declarations and duties’ below). 
  * VRT when the vehicle is registered (unless it is exempt) 
  * VAT on all new cars, and on used cars imported from Great Britain (including vehicles imported to Northern Ireland from Great Britain). 

If you are buying a vehicle from Northern Ireland which was previously
registered in Great Britain, you should make sure that you get documents to
show that customs duties were paid on arrival into Northern Ireland.

Revenue provides detailed information on [ importing a vehicle from the UK or
Northern Ireland ](https://www.revenue.ie/en/vrt/registration-of-imported-
used-vehicles/index.aspx) .

###  Customs declarations and duties

Under the trade agreement between the UK and the EU, items that have their
origin in the UK can be exported to the EU (including Ireland) without customs
duties or tariffs. But the rules on country of origin are complicated and mean
that even new vehicles bought from Great Britain may be liable to customs
charges if, for example, the vehicle was imported into Great Britain from
another country before being sold.

Northern Ireland continues to be treated as part of the EU under the trade
agreement. This means vehicles imported from Great Britain to Northern Ireland
have to go through customs and may have customs duties applied to them.

If you import a vehicle from Great Britain, you must make a customs
declaration.

  * **If the vehicle’s country of origin is the UK** , you do not have to pay customs duty if it is a new vehicle. Customs charges apply to all used vehicles imported from Great Britain. 
  * **If the vehicle’s country of origin is the EU or a third country** (for example Japan or USA), you have to pay customs duty 

If you buy a vehicle from Northern Ireland, you do not have to make a customs
declaration. But you must have proof that a customs declaration was made when
the vehicle arrived in Northern Ireland from Great Britain (if applicable).

###  Paying the customs charge

You must pay the customs charge at the time the vehicle arrives in Ireland
from Great Britain. This means you have to declare the vehicle with customs
when you are entering Ireland or Northern Ireland at the ferry port. If you
are importing the car using a shipping company, the shipping company should
arrange the customs declaration and charge.

You can [ claim a relief from customs ](https://www.revenue.ie/en/importing-
vehicles-duty-free-allowances/transfer-of-residence/index.aspx) if you are
transferring your residence to Ireland from the UK and your vehicle meets
certain conditions, for example, you were using the vehicle for more than 6
months in the UK before you moved to Ireland.

###  VAT

You have to [ pay VAT ](https://www.revenue.ie/en/vrt/calculating-vrt/vat-
customs-duty.aspx) on all used and new cars imported from Great Britain. You
have to pay VAT on a new car bought in Northern Ireland. You may not have to
pay VAT on a used car bought in Northern Ireland, if it has been in private
ownership in Northern Ireland for a reasonable period of time. An extra VAT
charge could apply if the vehicle was not properly imported from Great Britain
to Northern Ireland. Visit Revenue's website for more [ information about
importing used cars from Northern Ireland and VAT
](https://www.revenue.ie/en/vrt/registration-of-imported-used-
vehicles/registering-vehicles-from-ni.aspx) .

You can [ claim a VAT relief ](https://www.revenue.ie/en/importing-vehicles-
duty-free-allowances/transfer-of-residence/index.aspx) if you are transferring
your residence to Ireland from the UK and your vehicle meets certain
conditions, for example, you were using the vehicle for more than 6 months in
the UK before you moved to Ireland.

###  VRT and registration

You have to register your vehicle in Ireland within 30 days. You have to pay
Vehicle Registration Tax unless the vehicle is exempt.

You register the vehicle at a National Car Test (NCT) centre. You have to [
book an appointment online ](https://www.ncts.ie/1195) or by phoning
01-4135975. Before taking your vehicle for registration you must register the
[ certificate of conformity ](https://www.revenue.ie/en/online-
services/services/vehicle-services/electronic-certificate-conformity.aspx)
with Revenue.

When you go to register you should have the following documents:

  * A completed Vehicle Purchase Details [ VRTVPD2 form ](https://www.revenue.ie/en/importing-vehicles-duty-free-allowances/documents/vrt/form-vrtvpd2.pdf) if it is a vehicle for private (non- commercial) use 
  * The vehicle logbook (also called a V5C) 
  * A certificate of conformity (for new vehicles) 
  * An invoice with the date of purchase clearly shown 
  * Proof of your name and address 
  * Proof of your identity 
  * Proof of your PPS number 
  * An exemption certificate issued by Revenue if you are claiming an exemption from VRT 

If the vehicle was imported from Northern Ireland and your invoice is dated
more than 30 days before your appointment, you must have details of where the
vehicle was stored. If the vehicle was imported to Northern Ireland from the
EU, you must have the shipping details that show the date the vehicle arrived.
If the vehicle was imported from Great Britain, or another non-EU country, you
need the ‘single administrative number’ and the date it was issued by customs
at the point of entry.

You can buy your registration plates at the test centre and pay the VRT that
is due.

The NCT website provide useful answers to [ frequently asked questions about
registering your imported vehicle ](https://www.ncts.ie/vrt-home/vrt-faq/) .

###  Foreign registration documents

Most used cars imported into the State are bought in the United Kingdom (UK).
It is essential that you get the [ UK registration certificate, the V5C
](https://www.gov.uk/taking-vehicles-out-of-uk) , when you are buying your
vehicle in the UK.

When purchasing a vehicle abroad, you should not purchase a vehicle you intend
to import to Ireland unless you can get its accompanying foreign registration
documents. You should not return a vehicle's registration documents in full to
other States before registration in Ireland is complete. If you do not present
the relevant Foreign Registration Certificate, registration will be refused.

###  Motor tax, NCT and insurance

You have to pay [ motor tax ](/en/travel-and-recreation/motoring/motor-tax-
and-insurance/motor-tax-rates/) and the vehicle may have to have a [ National
Car Testing ](/en/travel-and-recreation/vehicle-standards/national-car-test/)
certificate. You must have [ motor insurance ](/en/travel-and-
recreation/motoring/motor-tax-and-insurance/motor-insurance/) to drive in
Ireland.

##  Importing a vehicle from the EU

If you are importing a car from the EU, you have to:

  * Register the vehicle 
  * Pay VRT unless you are exempt 
  * Pay VAT unless the vehicle is exempt 
  * Pay [ motor tax ](/en/travel-and-recreation/motoring/motor-tax-and-insurance/motor-tax-rates/)
  * Get [ motor insurance ](/en/travel-and-recreation/motoring/motor-tax-and-insurance/motor-insurance/)

###  VAT

If you are importing a new car from another EU country you have to pay VAT
(Value Added Tax), usually when registering the car. A new car means a car
that has been in service for 6 months or less, or has been driven for 6,000
kilometres or less. For example:

  * Vehicle is 5 months old with 8,000km - chargeable to VAT 
  * Vehicle is 7 months old with 5,000km - chargeable to VAT 
  * Vehicle is 7 months old with 8,000km - not chargeable to VAT 

The VAT is payable even where you have paid VAT in the other country. You may
get a refund of the VAT you paid in the other country. Find out more about [
buying cars in the EU ](https://taxation-customs.ec.europa.eu/buying-and-
selling-cars_en) .

###  NCT

If the vehicle is 4 years or older, you must have it [ tested by the National
Car Testing Service ](/en/travel-and-recreation/vehicle-standards/national-
car-test/) . You can use an EU Road Worthiness Certificate in Ireland until it
expires. You have to take the NCT when your Certificate expires.

###  Foreign registration documents

When purchasing a vehicle abroad, you should not purchase a vehicle you intend
to import to Ireland unless you can get its accompanying foreign registration
documents. You should not return a vehicle's registration documents in full to
other States before registration in Ireland is complete. If you do not present
the relevant Foreign Registration Certificate, registration will be refused.

##  Importing a vehicle from outside the EU

If you are importing a car from outside the EU you have to:

  * Pay a customs duty 
  * Register the vehicle 
  * Pay VRT unless you are exempt 
  * Pay VAT unless the vehicle is exempt 
  * Pay [ motor tax ](/en/travel-and-recreation/motoring/motor-tax-and-insurance/motor-tax-rates/)
  * Get [ motor insurance ](/en/travel-and-recreation/motoring/motor-tax-and-insurance/motor-insurance/)

The customs charge must be paid when the vehicle enters the EU (including
Ireland) or Northern Ireland.

If the vehicle is 4 years or older, you must have it [ tested by the National
Car Testing Service ](/en/travel-and-recreation/vehicle-standards/national-
car-test/) . If the vehicle has a current EU Roadworthiness Certificate, you
can have the time remaining on the certificate recognised in Ireland. This
means you will not have to take an NCT, until your certificate expires.

##  Vehicle Registration Tax

Vehicle Registration Tax (VRT) is a tax you must pay when you first register
your vehicle in Ireland. If you have imported a vehicle, you must pay VRT and
get the vehicle's registration certificate showing that you have paid VRT. If
you delay in registering your vehicle or paying Vehicle Registration Tax you
have to pay a penalty. Your vehicle could be also be seized.

You must register the car and pay the VRT at a National Car Testing Service
(NCTS) centre. The inspector examines your car to make sure that you are
paying the correct VRT. In the case of cars and small vans, the amount of VRT
payable is based on a percentage of the recommended retail price, which
includes all taxes. This price is known as the Open Market Selling Price
(OMSP). You can get an estimate of the VRT due from the [ Revenue Vehicle
Registration Online Enquiry System
](https://www.ros.ie/VRTEnquiryServlet/ShowVRT) .

Revenue has a [ guide to VRT ](https://www.revenue.ie/en/vrt/index.aspx) which
is a list of frequently asked questions about VRT in Ireland.

If you feel you are being over-charged, you can appeal it with Revenue using
the [ VRT appeals procedure ](http://www.revenue.ie/en/tax/vrt/leaflets/vrt-
appeals.html) .

###  How to register your vehicle

You must [ book an appointment with the NCTS ](https://www.ncts.ie/1230/)
within 7 days of your car's arrival into Ireland and you must complete the
registration process within 30 days of your arrival.

Your vehicle must have an [ electronic Certificate of Conformity
](https://www.revenue.ie/en/online-services/services/vehicle-
services/electronic-certificate-conformity.aspx) (e-CoC) before it is
registered. If you only have a paper version of your e-CoC, you must manually
[ input the details ](https://www.revenue.ie/en/vrt/documents/vrt/ecoc-
procedures-manual.pdf) onto the Revenue system.

You must have a [ Personal Public Service Number ](/en/social-welfare/irish-
social-welfare-system/personal-public-service-number/) (PPS number), proof of
identity (for example your passport or driving licence) and other specified
documents in order to register and pay the VRT. There is a [ list of the
documents required ](https://www.revenue.ie/en/vrt/guide-to-vrt/vehicle-
registration-tax/procedure-at-ncts-centre.aspx) on revenue.ie. You must have
the relevant Foreign Registration Certificate. **If you do not have it,
registration of the vehicle in Ireland will be refused.**

You must also be able to locate the Vehicle Identification Number (VIN number,
this is sometimes called the chassis number) for the vehicle inspector when
presenting the vehicle for inspection.

Once the vehicle has been registered and the VRT paid, you will get:

  * A receipt for the VRT paid showing the registration number assigned to your car. You must display the registration number within 3 days. You can get vehicle registration plates from the NCTS centre or any motor accessories dealer. 
  * A Form RF100 for use when you are applying to pay motor tax. To pay motor tax, you will need to insure the car and have your insurance details. You can pay motor tax online at motortax.ie or at the Motor Taxation Office of your local authority. After you have paid the motor tax, the Vehicle Registration Certificate will be issued to you by the Department of Transport. 

###  Vehicle registration plates

When you register and pay the VRT, a registration number will be assigned to
your car. You must display the registration number within 3 days. You are
committing an offence if you fail to display the new registration number and
you can be fined by An Garda Síochána. You can get [ vehicle registration
plates ](/en/travel-and-recreation/vehicle-standards/vehicle-registration-
numbers/) from the NCTS centre or any motor accessories dealer.

##  Exemptions from VRT

There are different reliefs and exemptions from VRT. Even if you do not have
to pay VRT, you must still register your vehicle when you come to Ireland. You
can find information on [ VRT reliefs and exemptions
](https://www.revenue.ie/en/importing-vehicles-duty-free-allowances/guide-to-
vrt/reliefs-and-exemptions/index.aspx) , and [ VRT reduction for certain
electrical vehicles ](https://www.revenue.ie/en/vrt/guide-to-vrt/calculating-
vrt/electric-hybrid-vehicles.aspx) for certain electric vehicles, on Revenue’s
website.

**Transferring residence:** If you are moving to live in Ireland, when you
apply for a VRT exemption, you must meet certain requirements as regards your
vehicle and your residency both here and abroad. You can find information
about when to apply for exemption, the evidence you need and the application
forms in the Revenue leaflet, [ Transfer of Residence
](https://www.revenue.ie/en/importing-vehicles-duty-free-allowances/guide-to-
vrt/reliefs-and-exemptions/transfer-of-residence.aspx) .

**Temporary exemptions:** In certain cases foreign-registered vehicles may be
imported into Ireland temporarily by a non-resident without the requirement to
pay VRT or register the vehicle. You can find information about [ Foreign
Registered Vehicles Temporary Exemptions
](https://www.revenue.ie/en/importing-vehicles-duty-free-allowances/guide-to-
vrt/reliefs-and-exemptions/temporary-exemption.aspx) on the Revenue website.

If you are moving to Ireland and are among those exempt from paying VRT you
cannot sell your vehicle for more than 12 months after the vehicle is
registered. If you are required to pay VRT, then you can sell your vehicle
here in Ireland when you wish, once it has been registered.

If you have a query about VRT exemptions, appeals or transfer of residence, [
contact Revenue ](http://www.revenue.ie/en/tax/vrt/contact-details.html) .

###  Export repayment scheme

If you are permanently removing or exporting a car from Ireland, you may be
able to claim a repayment of the VRT that had been paid previously.
Information about the [ Export Repayment Scheme and claim forms
](https://www.revenue.ie/en/importing-vehicles-duty-free-allowances/guide-to-
vrt/export-repayment-scheme/index.aspx) are available on revenue.ie.  

##  VRT rates

Vehicle Registration Tax (VRT) is based on the Open Market Selling Price
(OMSP) of the vehicle. The OMSP depends on the market value, engine size,
year, model and roadworthiness condition of the vehicle.

After the vehicle has been inspected the rate of [ VRT is calculated by
Revenue ](https://www.ros.ie/evrt-enquiry/vrtenquiry.html?execution=e1s1) .
The VRT is collected by the NCTS on behalf of Revenue.

VRT for cars (Category A) is based on the level of carbon dioxide (CO2)
emissions from the car and the car’s nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions.

**CO2 charge for Category A vehicles from 1 January 2022**

**CO2 emissions levels** |  **VRT rates**  
---|---  
0 - 50 grams per kilometre  |  7% of OMSP (minimum €140)   
50 – 80 grams per kilometre  |  9% of OMSP (minimum €180)   
80 –85 grams per kilometre  |  9.75% of OMSP (minimum €195)   
85 –90 grams per kilometre  |  10.5% of OMSP (minimum €210)   
90 –95 grams per kilometre  |  11.25% of OMSP (minimum €225)   
95 - 100 grams per kilometre  |  12% of OMSP (minimum €240)   
100 –105 grams per kilometre  |  12.75% of OMSP (minimum €255)   
105 - 110 grams per kilometre  |  13.5% of OMSP (minimum €270)   
110 – 115 grams per kilometre  |  15.25% of OMSP (minimum €305)   
115 – 120 grams per kilometre  |  16% of OMSP (minimum €320)   
120 – 125 grams per kilometre  |  16.75% of OMSP (minimum €335)   
125 – 130 grams per kilometre  |  17.5% of OMSP (minimum €350)   
130 – 135 grams per kilometre  |  19.25% of OMSP (minimum €385)   
135 – 140 grams per kilometre  |  20% of OMSP (minimum €400)   
140 - 145 grams per kilometre  |  21.5% of OMSP (minimum €430)   
145 – 150 grams per kilometre  |  25% of OMSP (minimum €500)   
150 – 155 grams per kilometre  |  27.5% of OMSP (minimum €550)   
155 – 170 grams per kilometre  |  30% of OMSP (minimum €600)   
170 - 190 grams per kilometre  |  35% of OMSP (minimum €700)   
More than 190 grams per kilometre  |  41% of OMSP (minimum €820)   
  
A Nitrogen Oxide (NOx) charge is combined with the existing CO2 charges to
form the VRT payable.

You have to give evidence of the vehicle’s NOx emissions to finalise
registration. If you do not give this information, you will be charged a flat
rate.

The NOx charge is calculated according to the following table:

NOx emissions (NOx mg/km or mg/kWh)  |  Amount payable per mg/km or mg/kWh   
---|---  
The first 0-40 mg/km or mg/kWh  |  €5   
The next 40 mg/km or mg/kWh up to 80 mg/km or mg/kWh  |  €15   
The rest above 80 mg/km or mg/kWh  |  €25   
  
If you do not give enough information about the NOx emissions these maximum
charges will apply:

  * Diesel vehicles: **€4,850**

or

  * All others: **€600**

The NOx charge replaces the 1% VRT surcharge on all diesel engine passenger
cars that was in place in 2019.

**Vehicle Registration Tax rates for all other categories**

**Category** |  **Vehicle** |  **VRT rate**  
---|---|---  
B  |  Commercial vehicles, designed and constructed for the carriage of goods and not exceeding 3.5 tonnes  |  13.3% of OMSP (subject to a minimum tax of €125)   
C  |  Other vehicles such as tractors, large vans, lorries, vintage cars (over 30 years old), minibuses (minimum 12 passenger seats)  |  Flat rate of €200   
|  Motor caravans/motor homes  |  13.3% of OMSP
