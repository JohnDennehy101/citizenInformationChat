##  What is Work and Access?

[ Work and Access ](/en/employment/employment-and-disability/work-and-access-
programme/) is a scheme to support inclusive employment by offering funding to
adjust workplaces and make them more accessible for people with disabilities.

Funding is available to qualifying job candidates, employees, self-employed
people, and employers.

There are 7 categories of Work and Access support:

  * [ Workplace Needs Assessment ](/en/employment/employment-and-disability/work-and-access-workplace-needs-assessment-grant/)
  * Communication Support 
  * [ In-Work Support ](/en/employment/employment-and-disability/work-and-access-in-work-support-grant/)
  * [ Personal Reader ](/en/employment/employment-and-disability/personal-reader-grant/)
  * [ Work Equipment ](/en/employment/employment-and-disability/work-and-access-workplace-equipment-grant/)
  * [ Workplace Adaptation ](/en/employment/employment-and-disability/workplace-equipment-adaptation-grant/)
  * [ Disability Equality and Inclusion Training ](/en/employment/employment-and-disability/disability-equality-and-inclusion-training-grant/)

This page explains the Communication Support Grant Grant. Depending on your
needs, you may be entitled to more than one support at the same time. Check
the [ Work and Access Programme
](https://control.citizensinformation.ie/en/employment/employment-and-
disability/work-and-access-programme/) details in full before you apply for
any support.

##  What is the Communication Support Grant?

If you are deaf, hard of hearing, have a speech impairment or another
disability that requires communication support, you can apply for funding to
pay for an interpreter under the Communication Support Grant.

The funding covers communication assistance during job interviews, job
inductions, in-work meetings, or performance reviews.

The Communication Support grant is only available to assist with jobs in the
private sector. If you have a public sector job or interview, it is up to the
organisation to interview or employ you to provide an interpreter.

##  Who can apply?

Employees, job candidates, employers and self-employed people can apply for
funding. You can make the application yourself or someone else can apply on
your behalf.

**How to qualify**

To qualify for communication support, you must meet one of the following
criteria:

  * Be deaf or hard of hearing, needing an [ Irish Sign Language ](https://www.risli.ie/) interpreter, lip-speaker, or other deaf interpreter. 
  * Have a disability or health condition that requires communication support. 

You must also meet the [ general eligibility criteria
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/employment/employment-and-
disability/work-and-access-programme/#3f40fb) for the Work and Access
programme.

##  Types of support available

You can apply for funding for communication support in the areas below. You
can apply for all the support available.

**Support around an interview**

  * 1 hour for familiarisation and interview preparation 
  * 3 hours for interpreter support during the interview itself 

Applications for interview support should be processed quickly because
interview notices are often short, and it can be difficult to find
interpreters quickly.

You can apply for support for as many interviews as you like.

**Job induction support**

  * Up to 12 hours of interpreter support for job induction during the first 12 months of your new job, for example, reviews. 

**In-work communication support**

  * Up to 24 hours of interpreter support over a 12-month rolling period 
  * 10 hours of communication support for a workplace needs assessment 
  * Up to 30 hours of communication support, if recommended by a workplace needs assessment 

The interpreter, lip-speaker, or communication support worker can provide
services either in person or remotely. If possible, your preferred format
should be accommodated.

##  Finding an interpreter

The job candidate, employee, or advocate must find a qualified interpreter,
lip-speaker, or communication support worker.

Providers must be either:

  * Registered as an Irish Sign Language interpreter with the Register of Irish Sign Language Interpreters ( [ risli.ie ](https://www.risli.ie/) ) 
  * Registered with a recognised interpreter service in Ireland 

Providers must also be tax-compliant and provide a Tax Clearance Certificate
(TCC) or a Tax Clearance Access Number (TCAN). Make sure the interpreter
understands these requirements before you hire them.

If you do not already have an interpreter, the [ Sign Language Interpreting
Service ](http://slis.ie/) can help you find a professional interpreter.

##  How much is the grant?

The grant amount depends on the interpreter’s qualifications and experience.

If you hire an interpreter through an agency, the payment usually goes to the
agency rather than directly to the interpreter.

##  How to apply

The Department of Social Protection (DSP) is developing an online application
process, which will be available soon.

In the meantime, follow the process below.

  * Final approval is required before purchasing any support. 
  * Applications submitted after purchasing supports cannot be processed or paid. 

###  **Appeals**

Work and Access is an administrative scheme, so you have no right to appeal a
particular decision on your application.

If you are unhappy with the decision, you can ask to have your case reviewed
by another DSP officer who was not involved in the original decision.

Write to the Department of Social Protection within 21 days of the decision,
explaining why you think the decision is wrong and provide any proof you have
to support your argument.
