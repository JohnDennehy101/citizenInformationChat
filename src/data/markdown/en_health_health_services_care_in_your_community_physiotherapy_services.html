##  What is physiotherapy?

Physiotherapy is used to treat pain, injury, disability and illnesses that can
affect you at any age.

A physiotherapist is a healthcare professional who:

  * Uses physical treatments such as exercise, acupuncture, and massage therapy 
  * Can prescribe a tailored exercise programme to suit your needs and health conditions 

You can pay for physiotherapy privately. You can also get physiotherapy
through the public health service ( [ Health Service Executive (HSE))
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/health/health-system/health-service-
executive/) in [ hospitals
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/health/health-services/gp-and-
hospital-services/hospital-services-introduction/) on an in-patient or out-
patient basis.

##  How much does physiotherapy cost?

####  Private physiotherapy

If you visit a physiotherapist as a private patient, you must pay fees. Fees
for private physiotherapy can vary, so you should contact the physiotherapist
directly for details of their charges. You may be offered a reduced fee if you
have a medical card or student card. You may be able to claim [ tax relief for
medical expenses ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/money-and-
tax/tax/income-tax-credits-and-reliefs/taxation-and-medical-expenses/) .

####  Physiotherapy through the HSE

You may be prioritised for free physiotherapy in your community from the [
Health Service Executive
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/health/health-system/health-service-
executive/) (HSE) if you have a:

  * [ Medical card ](/en/health/medical-cards-and-gp-visit-cards/medical-card/)
  * [ Health Amendment Act Card ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/health/health-services/blood-and-organ-donation/hepatitis-c-and-health-amendment-act-cards/)

##  Physiotherapy in your community from the HSE

The HSE may have physiotherapy services in your community, but this is not
available in all areas. You can contact your [ local health centre or clinic
](https://www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/2/healthcentres/) to check if there is
community physiotherapy in your area.

Your local health office may also provide physiotherapy in your home if you
have a disability.

##  How to apply for physiotherapy through the HSE

You need a referral from your family doctor (GP), [ public health nurse
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/health/health-services/care-in-your-
community/public-health-nurses/) or hospital to get physiotherapy as a public
patient.

Contact your [ Local Health Office
](http://www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/1/LHO/) or health centre for more
information on the availability of physiotherapy services in your area.

You can also refer yourself to a physiotherapist.

##  More information

Practising physiotherapists must be registered with the Physiotherapists
Registration Board at [ CORU, the regulator for health and social care
professionals ](/en/health/health-system/registration-of-health-and-social-
care-professionals/) .

The [ Irish Society of Chartered Physiotherapists (ISCP)
](https://www.iscp.ie/) is the body representing chartered physiotherapists. A
chartered physiotherapist is a physiotherapist that has a university degree
and hospital-based training.

You can read more about physiotherapy, including contact information for
chartered physiotherapists nationwide, on the ISCP website.
