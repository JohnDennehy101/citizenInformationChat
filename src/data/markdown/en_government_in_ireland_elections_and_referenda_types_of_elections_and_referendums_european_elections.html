##  Introduction

Direct elections to the [ European Parliament ](/en/government-in-
ireland/elections-and-referenda/types-of-elections-and-referendums/european-
elections/) are held every 5 years. In these elections, EU citizens choose who
will represent their interests in the European Parliament.

European Parliament elections take place within a 4-day period, normally in
June, all over the European Union. In Ireland the day for the election is set
by the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage. The last election
was held on 7 June 2024.

##  Who can vote in a European election?

Every Irish citizen aged 18 and over can vote in the European election. If you
are an Irish citizen but you are living in another EU country you can vote in
that country.

If you are from another EU Member State but are living in Ireland you can vote
in the European election in Ireland. To do so your name has to be on the [
register of electors ](/en/government-in-ireland/elections-and-
referenda/voting/registering-to-vote/) . If you are an EU citizen but have not
registered to vote at a previous European election in Ireland you must apply
for registration and complete a statutory declaration form, EP1 (available
from your local authority). The statutory declarations are sent to your home
Member State to make sure people are not voting twice.

You cannot vote in the European election in more than one constituency or
country.

##  How are candidates nominated for election to the European Parliament?

You may nominate yourself as a candidate or be nominated by a voter from the
constituency. A candidate may only be nominated in one constituency.

To be nominated or nominate yourself for membership of the European
Parliament, you must do one of the following:

  * Produce a Certificate of Party Affiliation 
  * Produce 60 statutory declarations of assentors who are registered voters in the constituency (Form EP2A must be completed by assentors and witnessed by a Commissioner for Oaths, Peace Commissioner, Notary Public, member of the Garda Síochána or official of the registration authority) 
  * Pay a deposit of €1,800 

To apply, you must get a nomination paper from the returning officer for your
constituency. You can get contact information for the returning officer for
your constituency from the Franchise Section of [ your local authority
](/en/government-in-ireland/how-government-works/local-and-regional-
government/functions-of-local-authorities/) . The returning officer must rule
on whether a nomination paper is valid within one hour of receiving it.

The period for the nomination of candidates starts about 6 weeks before
polling day and lasts 1 or 2 weeks depending on the nationality of the
candidate.

##  How are MEPs replaced?

There are no by-elections for the European Parliament. If an MEP dies or
resigns, the vacancy is filled from a replacement list. Before the close of
European election nominations, each registered political party or independent
candidate may submit a list of up to 6 replacement candidates to the returning
officer.

If an MEP dies or resigns, the person who is at the top of his or her
replacement list and is willing to become an MEP fills the vacancy.

##  Candidate spending and donation limits

###  Spending limits

The spending limit for a candidate in a European election is €230,000. A
statement in writing of all election expenses must be submitted to the
Standards in Public Offices Commission within 56 days of polling day.

###  Donation limits

An MEP or a candidate at a European election may not accept a donation greater
than €1,000 in any year from the same donor. Any donations over €600 must be
reported to the [ Standards in Public Office Commission (SIPO)
](https://www.sipo.ie/) . Candidates are not allowed to accept anonymous
donations greater than €100 - any such donations must be surrendered to SIPO.
