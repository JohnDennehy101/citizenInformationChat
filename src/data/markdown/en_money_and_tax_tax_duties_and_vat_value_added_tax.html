##  Introduction

Value Added Tax (VAT) is a tax charged on the sale of goods or services and is
usually included in the price of most products and services.

If you order or bring goods into Ireland from outside the European Union (EU),
you may be charged VAT when the goods arrive into Ireland.

##  How VAT is charged

VAT is a tax on consumer spending, so everyone who pays for goods and services
pays VAT. It is built into the cost of many commonly consumed items such as
clothing and petrol, so you don’t see what percentage of VAT you are paying.
However, when you are buying some items or services, such as electricity and
professional services, you may see the amount of VAT and the rate at which you
are being charged on your bill.

VAT is charged at every stage of sale where the cost of an item is increased.

The [ current standard rate ](https://www.revenue.ie/en/vat/vat-rates/search-
vat-rates/current-vat-rates.aspx) of VAT is 23%.

**Example**

A manufacturer sells a television to a wholesaler for €100 and charges him VAT
on that amount at 23%. Therefore, the wholesaler pays €123 for the television.
The manufacturer then pays the VAT of €23 to the government.

The wholesaler goes on to sell the television to a retailer for €200. He adds
on VAT at 23%, so the retailer pays a total of €246. The wholesaler must pay
the government the VAT of €46, but he can reclaim the €23 VAT he has already
paid to the manufacturer, leaving €23, which he pays to the government.

When the retailer comes to sell the television to a consumer, he must also add
on VAT to his selling price. He sells the television for €300, plus VAT at
23%, making a selling price of €369 for the consumer. The retailer must pay
the VAT to the government but he can claim back the €46 VAT that he paid to
the wholesaler, leaving €23 for the government.

The government has now received 23% on the price paid for the television by
the consumer (€69). The retailer, wholesaler and manufacturer only paid the
amount of VAT they charged to the next group down the line.

##  VAT on imports

This section only deals with VAT for consumers who buy goods for personal use.

In general, you have to pay VAT and import duty on any goods you are bringing
into Ireland from outside the European Union (EU). This includes goods
purchased online and by mail order. You will have to pay VAT at the same rate
as applies in Ireland for similar goods.

Within the EU, VAT is usually paid in the member state you purchased the
goods, however, there are some exceptions - see below.

###  If you buy online

**From outside the EU**

From 1 July 2021, the VAT exemption on goods up to a value of €22 from outside
the EU no longer applies. All goods arriving into Ireland from non-EU
countries are subject to VAT.

Some online retailers are registered with the [ Import One Stop Shop (IOSS)
](https://www.revenue.ie/en/vat/vat-ecommerce/import-oss/index.aspx) so that
VAT can be included in the price you pay for the goods. Before you make a
purchase, check whether the advertised price includes tax and duty costs.

Customs duty is charged on goods with a value over €150.

Excise Duty is payable on alcohol and tobacco products and is separate from
Customs Duty.

Revenue has a guide to [ buying goods from outside the EU for personal use
](https://www.revenue.ie/en/customs/individuals/buying-online-
personal/outside-eu.aspx) including information on how to calculate what you
owe in duties and taxes.

**From another EU Member State**

If you buy goods online or by mail from another EU member state you may pay
VAT at the rate that applies in Ireland. However, if the supplier that you are
buying the goods from has not exceeded the [ Distance Sales Threshold
](http://www.revenue.ie/en/vat/goods-and-services-to-and-from-abroad/distance-
sales/index.aspx) in Ireland then you will pay VAT at the rate that would
apply in the country of purchase. You will usually be told the amount of VAT
payable at checkout.

Excisable products (for example, alcohol, tobacco and oil) purchased within
the EU via the internet or by mail are subject to [ excise duty ](/en/money-
and-tax/tax/duties-and-vat/excise-duties/) and VAT.

###  Travelling with your purchases

**From outside the EU**

You can buy and bring your goods (other than tobacco and alcohol products)
from a non-EU State into Ireland without paying any taxes, if their value is
no more than:

  * €430 if you are aged over 15 
  * €215 if you are aged under 15 

You will have to pay VAT and customs duty on anything over these amounts.

If you bring in an item worth more than the €430 or €215 limit, you must pay
import charges on the full value. Revenue has [ information on duties and
taxes if you are arriving in Ireland from outside the EU
](https://www.revenue.ie/en/customs/individuals/info-travelling-duty-
free/from-outside-eu/index.aspx) .

**From another EU Member State**

There are no limits on what you can buy and take with you when you travel
between EU countries, as long as the products you bought are for your own
personal use and not for resale.

VAT is included in the price of the product in the EU member state and no
further payment of taxes including VAT can be charged here in Ireland. The
exception to this is where you are [ importing a vehicle ](/en/moving-
country/moving-to-ireland/coming-to-live-in-ireland/importing-car-into-
ireland/) from the EU.

Special rules apply in the case of goods subject to excise duty, such as
alcohol and tobacco products. Revenue has [ information on duties and taxes if
you are arriving in Ireland from within the EU
](https://www.revenue.ie/en/customs/individuals/info-travelling-duty-
free/from-within-eu/index.aspx) .

###  Gifts from outside the EU

You can receive a gift from outside the EU up to the value of €45 without
paying import charges. However, the gift must be correctly declared. More
information is available in Revenue’s [ guide to relief available for imports
from non-EU countries ](http://www.revenue.ie/en/importing-vehicles-duty-free-
allowances/gifts-and-consignments-of-low-value/rules-for-duty-relief-on-gift-
consignments.aspx) .

##  VAT on residential property

If you:

  * Buy a new house from a builder or developer, you will be charged VAT at 13.5% 
  * Buy or sell an ‘old’ or existing property, you do not have to pay VAT 
  * Buy a site for a house from a landowner, you do not have to pay VAT unless you have an agreement with both the landowner and a builder to develop the site   

If a new property is resold within 5 years of its completion, it is taxable
for VAT if it has not been lived in for at least 2 years. Revenue has [
detailed information about when a property is taxable for VAT (pdf)
](https://www.revenue.ie/en/tax-professionals/tdm/value-added-
tax/part11-immovable-goods/supply-of-property/supply-of-property.pdf) .

If you are a landlord, you cannot charge VAT on rent from residential
property.

If you paid VAT on your house (because you bought it from a developer or
builder) you only have to pay [ stamp duty ](/en/housing/owning-a-home/buying-
a-home/stamp-duty/) on the base price of the house – before the VAT was added.
So, for example, if you paid €227,000 (including VAT) for your new house, this
is made up of the base price of €200,000 plus 13.5% VAT (€27,000) and you only
pay stamp duty on the base price of €200,000.

##  Rates

VAT is charged at different rates for various goods and services. Revenue has
[ information on the different rates of VAT that apply
](https://www.revenue.ie/en/vat/vat-rates/index.aspx) . Some examples are
included below.

**23%** is the standard rate of VAT. All goods and services that do not fall
into the reduced rate categories are charged at this rate. They include
alcohol, audio-visual equipment, car parts and accessories, CDs, computers,
consultancy services, cosmetics, detergents, diesel, fridges, furniture and
furnishings, hardware, jewellery, lawnmowers, machinery, office equipment, pet
food, petrol, paper, tobacco, toys, tools, bottled water, washing machines and
most medicines (non-oral).

**13.5%** is a reduced rate of VAT for items including coal, heating oil, vet
fees, building and building services, agricultural contracting services,
short-term car hire, cleaning and maintenance services.

**9%** is a second reduced rate. Gas and electricity were reduced to this rate
from 1 May 2022 and extended to 31 October 2024 by [ Budget 2024 ](/en/money-
and-tax/budgets/budget-2024/) .

The VAT rate for the hospitality and tourism sector also decreased from 13.5%
to 9%, for the period 1 November 2020 to 31 August 2023. This applied to
various entertainment services such as admission to cinemas, theatres,
museums, fairgrounds and amusement parks. VAT at 9% also applies to
hairdressing and certain printed materials such as brochures, maps and
programmes.

**4.8%** is a reduced rate of VAT specifically for agriculture. It applies to
livestock (excluding chickens), greyhounds and the hire of horses.

**0%** (Zero) VAT rating includes all exports, tea, coffee, milk, bread,
books, children’s clothes and shoes, vegetable seeds and fruit trees,
fertilisers, large animal feed, oral medicine for humans and animals,
disability aids such as wheelchairs, crutches and hearing aids. It was
announced in Budget 2023 that the 0% rate would be extended from 1 January
2023 to newspapers (including digital editions), defibrillators, period
products and non-oral medicines for Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT) and
nicotine replacement therapy. It was announced in Budget 2024 that the rate
for ebooks and audio books would be reduced to 0% (from 9%) from 1 January
2024.

**Exempt from VAT**

You do not have to pay any VAT on financial, medical or educational services.
You may also not pay VAT for live theatrical and musical performances (except
those where food or drink is served during all or part of the performance).

**Difference between exemption and zero-rating**

If a business person supplies taxable goods or services, including zero-rated
ones, they can claim VAT back from the government on their taxable business
purchases. However, if someone only supplies exempt goods or services, they
cannot reclaim VAT.

##  Claiming back VAT

**People not registered for VAT  
** Under certain circumstances, people can claim back VAT. People with
disabilities can claim a [ VAT refund on certain aids and appliances
](/en/money-and-tax/tax/tax-credits-and-reliefs-for-people-with-
disabilities/vat-refunds-on-aids-and-appliances-used-by-people-with-
disabilities/) .

**People registered for VAT  
** A business person must register for VAT to fulfil tax obligations to the
government. Registering for VAT also allows a business to reclaim VAT on
purchases.
