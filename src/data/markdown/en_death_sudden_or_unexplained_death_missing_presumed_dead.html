#  Missing, presumed dead

  * Introduction

##  Introduction

When people are [ reported missing ](/en/justice/crime-and-crime-
prevention/reporting-a-missing-person/) in Ireland, most are found and safely
reunited with their families, but a small minority remain on the [ Garda
National Missing Persons List ](https://www.garda.ie/en/missing-persons/) .

The following information explains the legal situation in Ireland regarding
the estate and possessions of a missing person if they are presumed dead.

If someone is thought to be dead but there is no body (for example, because a
person was lost at sea), all of their assets and property are usually frozen.
Two exceptions to this are:

  * Where the property is jointly owned 
  * Where someone has [ Power of Attorney ](/en/death/before-a-death/power-of-attorney/) to deal with their property or money in their absence 

##  Dealing with the missing person's property

The [ Civil Law (Presumption of Death) Act 2019
](https://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2019/act/23/enacted/en/print) allows a
court to make a "presumption of death order" if it is satisfied that the
person's death is either virtually certain, or highly probable. You no longer
have to wait 7 years.

If such an order is made and not successfully appealed, it has the same status
as a death certificate.

###  When to apply for an order

There is no minimum waiting period before an application can be made if the
applicant can provide enough evidence to satisfy the court that the person is
virtually certain to have died.

However, if the applicant can only produce evidence to satisfy the court that
it is highly probable that the missing person is dead, then they must wait one
year.

###  Presumption of death order

A wide category of people can apply for a presumption of death order,
including:

  * All family members 
  * Dependants 
  * Cohabitants 

This allows beneficiaries to seek death-related entitlements and ends the
marriage or civil partnership of the missing person. Any person applying for a
presumption of death order must notify all the other persons potentially
affected by any order.

The application will normally be made in the [ Circuit Court
](/en/justice/courts-system/circuit-court/) but in certain cases will need to
be made in the [ High Court ](/en/justice/courts-system/high-court/) .

In addition, if an order is made, the applicant must take out insurance
against any losses arising if the person returns. However, the cost of this
insurance will be charged to the missing personâ€™s estate. The court can also
waive this requirement.

A court must take into account all the circumstances surrounding the
disappearance and absence of the missing person in deciding whether to make an
order, including:

  * Abandonment of valuable property 
  * Searches made after the disappearance 
  * Any possible motive for disappearing 
  * Any possibility of foul play 
  * Life insurance recently taken out by the missing person 
  * Any prior history of fraud on the part of the missing person 

There is also scope for a presumption of death order to be varied or revoked
if there is new evidence suggesting the person is alive.

##  Unidentified remains

The Department of Justice has collated data from coroners about the number of
unidentified remains in the State. This data has been made available to the
public as it may help resolve unsolved missing persons cases.

You can view the [ unidentified human remains datasheet
](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/ae2ea-unidentified-human-remains/) on the
Department of Justice website. You should contact the relevant [ coroner
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/death/sudden-or-unexplained-
death/coroners/) if you have any queries relating to the data.

###  **DNA database**

DNA profiling can help make breakthroughs in missing persons cases thanks to
the DNA database. [ Forensic Science Ireland ](https://forensicscience.ie/)
manage the [ DNA database
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/justice/evidence/dna-evidence/#l6b752)
in the State.
