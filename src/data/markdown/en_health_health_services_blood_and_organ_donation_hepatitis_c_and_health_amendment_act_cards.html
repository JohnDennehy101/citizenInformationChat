##  What is a HAA card?

If you have contracted [ Hepatitis C
](https://www2.hse.ie/conditions/hepatitis/#hepatitis-c) from Human
Immunoglobulin-Anti-D or another blood product or blood transfusion in Ireland
you can get a Health Amendment Act (HAA) Card (see [ How to apply for a HAA
card below ](/en/health/health-services/blood-and-organ-donation/hepatitis-c-
and-health-amendment-act-cards#ld6801) ).

With a HAA card you can get the following services for free even if you need
them for non-Hepatitis C-related illnesses:

  * General practitioner (doctor) [ services ](/en/health/health-services/gp-and-hospital-services/gp-services-to-medical-card-holders/) (any GP is eligible) 
  * Public in-patient and out-patient hospital services 
  * [ Prescribed drugs and medicines ](/en/health/drugs-and-medicines/prescribed-drugs-and-medicines/) and medical and surgical aids and appliances 
  * Home nursing and [ home support services ](/en/health/health-services/health-services-for-older-people/home-support-service/)
  * [ Dental ](/en/health/health-services/dental-aural-and-optical-services/dental-services/) , [ ophthalmic ](/en/health/health-services/dental-aural-and-optical-services/sight-tests-and-eye-health/) and [ aural services and appliances ](/en/health/health-services/dental-aural-and-optical-services/hearing-and-ear-health/)
  * [ Physiotherapy services ](/en/health/health-services/care-in-your-community/physiotherapy-services/)
  * Counselling services for both you and your family 
  * A range of other services such as chiropody and podiatry service 

You can read more about these services in the [ HSE handbook of services Under
the Health (Amendment) Act, 1996 (pdf) ](https://www.hse.ie/eng/national-
hepatitis-c-treatment-programme/haa-information-guide.pdf) or get more
information from your Hepatitis C Liaison Officer in your [ Local Health
Office ](https://www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/1/lho/) .

The HSE arranges for the supply of certain medical and surgical appliances
that are not available from a pharmacist.

##  Hepatitis C Liaison Officers and Clinical Nurse Specialists

You have access to a local HSE Hepatitis C Liaison Officer. They will help you
get all the non-hospital (primary care) services that you are entitled to.
Find the [ contact details of your local Hepatitis C liaison officer
](https://www.hse.ie/eng/about/who/primarycare/guidetohepcservices.html) on
the HSE website.

You can also access Clinical Nurse Specialists in the liver units of the eight
designated hospitals. They will help you get the hospital services you are
entitled to.

##  How to apply for a HAA card

You can apply for a Health Amendment Act (HAA) Card if you got Hepatitis C in
Ireland directly or indirectly by:

  * The administration of Human Immunoglobulin-Anti-D or 
  * Another blood product or a blood transfusion 

To apply for a HAA Card contact your [ Hepatitis C Liaison Officer
](https://www.hse.ie/eng/about/who/primarycare/guidetohepcservices.html) in [
your Local Health Office ](http://www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/1/LHO) or the
National Hepatitis C Office.

You will have a HAA card for life, including access to all of the health
services listed above.

##  Hepatitis C Insurance Scheme

If you were infected with Hepatitis C and/or HIV from Human Immunoglobulin-
Anti-D or another blood product or blood transfusion in Ireland, you can
access the Hepatitis C Insurance Scheme. This provides access to life
assurance, mortgage protection and travel insurance.

If you are part of this scheme, you only pay the average basic premium that an
uninfected person of the same age and gender would pay. The scheme pays the
additional premiums levied or covers the additional risks that would otherwise
prevent a policy being taken out

###  How to apply for the Hepatitis C Insurance Scheme

You need an Eligibility Certificate to get the Insurance Scheme.

To get an Eligibility Certificate contact the HSE Insurance Scheme
Administrator (details below), who will send you an application pack.
Eligibility is based on certain criteria.

If you have a HAA Card or have received an award from the Hepatitis C
Compensation Tribunal you are automatically entitled to take out insurance
under the scheme.
