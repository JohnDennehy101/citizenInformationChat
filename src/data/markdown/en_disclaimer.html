##  Introduction

By means of this website, the Citizens Information Board provides information
concerning public and social services.

Every reasonable effort has been made to ensure that the information provided
by this website is reasonably comprehensive, accurate and clear.

However, the information provided on or via this website may not necessarily
be completely comprehensive or accurate, and, for this reason, it is provided
on an "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" basis.

If you think you may have noticed any error or omission, please let us know by
contacting [ ciofeedback@ciboard.ie ](mailto:ciofeedback@ciboard.ie) . It is
our policy to correct errors or omissions as soon as any error or omission has
been established to our satisfaction.

##  General Information Only

While the Citizens Information Board makes every reasonable effort to provide
information that is as comprehensive, accurate and clear as possible, the
information provided on this site is necessarily of a general nature and may
not address the specific circumstances of a particular individual.

##  Simple Descriptions

Responses to queries, and the contents of, and documents on, or available
from, this site describe schemes and services as simply as possible. These
schemes and services may involve technically complex issues (for example,
legal issues). The information provided or the simple descriptions available
on, or via, this site may not address all such issues, or address them in
sufficient detail for your particular needs.

##  Your Particular Circumstances

If you wish to find out what your particular position is in your own
particular circumstances, or if have an enquiry about any particular
entitlements or services that may be available to you, you may need to seek
appropriate professional, or other, advice and/or contact the particular
agency or agencies responsible.

##  No Legal or Other Professional Advice Given

In particular, the information provided on this site is not legal advice or
professional advice of any other kind, and should not be considered to be
such, or relied or acted upon in that regard. If you need legal or other
professional advice, you should consult a suitably qualified person.

##  Information Only

The Citizens Information Board provides information on, and on the

or services, nor for the way in which such schemes or services may be operated
and administered in practice.

rights of any person, or any liability arising out of any information or

##  General Disclaimer, Representations, Warranties and Terms

To the extent permitted by law, the Citizens Information Board and the State,
and their respective servants or agents, assume and accept no responsibility
for, and give no guarantees, undertakings or warranties concerning, the
accuracy, clarity, comprehensiveness, completeness, timeliness, fitness-for-
purpose, up-to-date nature, reliability, or otherwise, of the information
provided on this website, and do not accept any liability whatsoever in
respect of, or arising from, any errors or omissions or any reliance on, or
use of, such information.

Whilst we have taken reasonable care in compiling this website, to the extent
permitted by law, we accept no responsibility for any loss or damage claimed
to arise from any reliance on, or action taken by any person or organisation,
wherever they are based, as a result, direct or otherwise, of, information
