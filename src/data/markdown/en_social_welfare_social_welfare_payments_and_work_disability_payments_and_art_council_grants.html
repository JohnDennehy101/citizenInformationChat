#  Disability payments and the Arts and Disability Connect fund

  * What is the Arts and Disability Connect (ADC) fund? 
  * Invalidity Pension and the ADC fund 
  * Disability Allowance, Blind Pension and the ADC fund 

##  What is the Arts and Disability Connect (ADC) fund?

If you are an artist with a disability, you may be eligible for the Arts and
Disability Connect (ADC) fund. The ADC fund can help you to develop your
practice and to connect with art organisations and professionals in Ireland.

Applications to the [ Arts and Disability Connect
](https://www.artscouncil.ie/Funds/Arts-and-Disability-Connect/) fund are
decided by [ Arts and Disability Ireland ](https://adiarts.ie/) .

####  **Effect on disability payments**

If you are an artist and getting a [ disability payment
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/disability_and_illness/)
from the Department of Social Protection (DSP), any income you get including
funding from [ The Arts Council ](https://www.artscouncil.ie/home/) may affect
your payment.

You will be considered as self-employed by the DSP, if you get ADC funding and
one of the following social welfare payments:

  * Disability Allowance 
  * Blind Pension 
  * Invalidity Pension 

##  Invalidity Pension and the ADC fund

If you are getting an [ Invalidity Pension ](/en/social-welfare/disability-
and-illness/partial-capacity-benefit/) and accept ADC funding, you must
transfer to [ Partial Capacity Benefit (PCB) ](/en/social-welfare/disability-
and-illness/partial-capacity-benefit/) . Your rate of PCB is determined by
your capacity for work. Your rate of PCB is not affected by your ADC funding.

##  Disability Allowance, Blind Pension and the ADC fund

ADC funding is assessed as self-employment income in the means test for
Disability Allowance (DA) and Blind Pension (BP). The means test examines all
your sources of income to find out if you qualify for DA or BP.

[ Allowable work-related expenses
](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/11f23e-means-assessment-guidelines/#cash-
income) can be deducted from the ADC grant when your means are assessed.

If your ADC funding stops within 12 months, you can return to your Disability
Allowance or Blind Pension payment. Your means may be reassessed.

####  **How ADC funding is assessed**

The total amount of ADC funding that you are awarded is divided by the number
of weeks in the award period to give a weekly amount.

This weekly amount is then assessed as income from self-employment, as
follows:

  * The first €165 of funding is disregarded (not counted) 
  * 50% of funding between €166 and €375 is assessed 
  * Funding over €375 is assessed in full 

####  Example for Blind Pension

I am getting a weekly Blind Pension of €220. I was awarded Arts and Disability
Connect funding of €15,000 over 12 months. How will my Blind Pension be
affected?

  * Blind Pension is €220 per week 
  * ADC funding is €288.46 per week 
  * The first €165 is not counted in the means test (€288.46 - 165 = €123.46) 
  * 50% of funding between €166 and €375 is assessed (€123.46/2 = €61.73) 
  * Means of €61.73 will give you a new Blind Pension of €165 per week, see [ SW19 ](https://www.gov.ie/en/collection/1af6ca-rates-of-payment-sw19/) for how means affects BP 

Your new income is €453.46 per week. This includes your Blind Pension of €165
and ADC funding of €288.46 per week.

####  Example for Disability Allowance

I am getting a weekly Disability Allowance of €220. I was awarded Arts and
Disability Connect funding of €15,000 over 12 months. Will my Disability
Allowance be affected?

  * Disability Allowance is €220 per week 
  * ADC funding is €288.46 per week 
  * The first €165 is not counted in the means test (€288.46 - 165 = €123.46) 
  * 50% of earnings between €166 and €375 is assessed (€123.46/2 = €61.73) 
  * Means of €61.73 will give you a new Disability Allowance of €165 per week, see [ SW19 ](https://www.gov.ie/en/collection/1af6ca-rates-of-payment-sw19/) for how means affects Disability Allowance 

Your new income is €453.46 per week. This includes Disability Allowance of
€165 and ADC funding of €288.46 per week.
