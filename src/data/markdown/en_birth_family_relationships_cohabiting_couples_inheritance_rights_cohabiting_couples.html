##  Introduction

If you are at least 18 years old and of sound mind, you may [ make a will
](/en/death/before-a-death/making-a-will/) . If you later get married or if
you entered a civil partnership, that will is automatically cancelled unless
it was made with that marriage or civil partnership in mind. However, if you
enter into cohabitation (that is, move in to live with a partner), it has no
effect on your pre-existing will.

##  Rules

If you are married or in a civil partnership, the [ Succession Act 1965
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1965/en/act/pub/0027/index.html) gives your
surviving spouse/civil partner a legal right to a share of your estate (your
possessions) when you die, no matter what you have said in your will.

This does not apply to cohabiting couples. If you are in a cohabiting
relationship and you die without a will, your partner has no automatic right
to any share of your estate no matter how long you have been together. Items
which were jointly owned by cohabitants will automatically pass though to the
surviving cohabitant and not form part of the deceased’s estate. However, [
Capital Acquisitions Tax ](/en/money-and-tax/tax/capital-taxes/capital-
acquisitions-tax/) may be payable.

If you are or have been married or in a civil partnership, your spouse or
civil partner may be legally entitled to a share of your estate even though
you are now separated from him or her.

Many people are not aware of these issues. It is very important to know your
rights if you are cohabiting.

##  Cohabitants and inheritance tax

Even if your partner has provided for you in their will, you will be treated
as strangers for [ Capital Acquisitions Tax ](/en/money-and-tax/tax/capital-
taxes/capital-acquisitions-tax/) purposes in terms of your inheritance.
Cohabiting partners pay tax at 33% on gifts/inheritance over €16,250.

In the case of a cohabiting couple where the surviving partner inherits the
family home, the surviving partner may be liable for inheritance tax, unless
the surviving partner qualifies for [ dwelling house tax exemption
](https://www.revenue.ie/en/gains-gifts-and-inheritance/cat-
exemptions/dwelling-house/index.aspx) .

##  If your partner has not made a willor has not provided for you

A financially dependent cohabitant may be able to apply to the courts for
provision to be made for you from the estate of your deceased partner if the
relationship ends as the result of death or otherwise. This is known as the [
redress scheme for cohabiting couples ](/en/birth-family-
relationships/problems-in-marriages-and-other-relationships/redress-scheme-
for-cohabiting-couples/) . If you get redress by a court under this scheme,
you may be exempt from paying Capital Acquisition Tax.

###  Qualified cohabitant

In order to apply for redress you must be a qualified cohabitant, that is, you
must have been:

  * Living with the person for at least 5 years in an intimate and committed relationship or 
  * Living with the person for 2 years in an intimate and committed relationship if you have had a dependent child with your partner 

If you do qualify to apply under the redress scheme, you still may not be
entitled to any provision or share of your partner’s estate if they die. Much
will depend on the financial relationship between you and your partner, each
partner’s financial circumstances, whether your partner was still married or
had children and the size of the estate your partner leaves.

##  Cohabitants' agreement

Cohabitants can enter into a “cohabitants’ agreement” which will govern your
financial responsibilities to one another. To be valid, the cohabitants’
agreement must be in writing and signed by both cohabitants. Both of you must
have received legal advice before entering into the agreement. Preferably,
each cohabitant will have received separate legal advice.

A cohabitant’s agreement can specify that either party cannot make an
application under the redress scheme. However, a court can override this in
exceptional circumstances where it would cause serious injustice.

It is very important to discuss the matter of inheritance during your
relationship with your partner and seek legal advice.

##  Making a will

[ Making a will ](/en/death/before-a-death/making-a-will/)

can ensure that proper arrangements are made for your partner and dependants
and that your property is distributed in the way you wish after you die,
subject to certain rights of spouses/civil partners and children. Tax planning
advice can help reduce or minimise the amount of tax your beneficiaries must
pay. A solicitor can help you draft a will or you can draft one yourself.

##  Children's inheritance rights

Children, whether born inside or outside marriage or adopted, have the same
inheritance rights in respect to their parents' estate. There is more
information on inheritance rights in the [ document on what happens the
deceased's estate ](/en/death/the-deceaseds-estate/what-happens-the-deceaseds-
estate/) .
