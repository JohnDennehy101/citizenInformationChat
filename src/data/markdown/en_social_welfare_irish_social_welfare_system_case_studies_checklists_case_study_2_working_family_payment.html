#  Case study 2: Working Family Payment (WFP)

  * Case study 

##  Case study

###  **This is an example showing how income is assessed for Working Family
Payment in 2024**

John is living with his partner Mary and their 4 children. He has been working
for a company for some time but his hours are irregular, varying from 30 to 48
hours per week. As a result, he can earn between €330 and €528 gross per week.

Mary is getting [ Carer’s Allowance
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/social-welfare-
payments/carers/carers-allowance/) of €248 and also works part-time as a home-
help for the Health Service Executive (HSE) earning €96 per week.

Their daughter is 15 years old and has a part-time job at the weekend, earning
€45 per week.

John and Mary get [ Child Benefit
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/social-welfare-
payments/families-and-children/child-benefit/) of €560 per month for their 4
children.

####  **Working Family Payment calculation**

Weekly net income from employment ( **See note 1 below** ) €398 plus €96 =
€494

**Add** weekly net income from self-employment 0

**Add** social welfare payments ( **See note 2 below** ) €248

**Add** Income from occupational pensions 0

**Total income €742**

The maximum income limit for a family with 4 children is €938. The difference
between €938 and €742 is €196.

60% of the difference is €117.60

**John will get Working Family Payment of €118 each week (rounded up to
nearest euro).**

**Note 1**

John’s hours are irregular and therefore the amount he earns can vary from
week to week. To find his total weekly income, the Department can average his
income over a period of 6 to 8 weeks. In this case, his income averaged out
over six weeks is €398.

John’s income from employment is assessed and Mary’s casual income from
working as a home-help for the HSE is also assessed. Their daughter’s income
is not assessed because she is under 22 years of age and in full-time
education.

**Note 2**

Child Benefit is not included in the assessment of Working Family Payment.
However, all of Mary's Carer's Allowance will be assessed as income.
