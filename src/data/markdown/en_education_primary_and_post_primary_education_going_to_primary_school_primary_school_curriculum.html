#  Curriculum in primary schools

  * What is the school curriculum? 
  * What do children learn at school? 
  * Further information 

##  What is the school curriculum?

The curriculum sets out the subjects children study in school.

It sets out what your child is taught and how their learning is assessed in
each subject.

Ireland's primary and post-primary school curricula are set by the Minister
for Education who is advised by the [ National Council for Curriculum and
Assessment (NCCA) ](https://ncca.ie/en) .

##  What do children learn at school?

The primary school curriculum consists of 7 curricular areas. Some areas are
further divided into subjects. The 7 areas are:

  * Language: [ Gaeilge (pdf) ](https://www.curriculumonline.ie/getmedia/920c3fd9-1f53-4163-a045-90f07ebb6b71/PSEC01b-Gaeilge_curriculum.pdf) , [ English (pdf) ](https://www.curriculumonline.ie/getmedia/5b514700-e65c-46a7-a7d0-c8e05e115bf9/PSEC01a_English_Curriculum.pdf)

  * Religious Education is the responsibility of the school patron 

The curriculum aims to provide all children with learning opportunities that
recognise and celebrate their uniqueness and develop their full potential.

The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA) provides [
information for parents ](https://www.curriculumonline.ie/Primary) about the
curriculum. It also provides advice on how you can support your child's
learning at school and at home.

###  Assessment of children in school

An assessment gathers information about how your child learns and what they
learn. The assessment can show how your child is progressing and developing.

Schools must regularly evaluate students and periodically report the results
of the evaluation to students and their parents.

Children's learning and achievements are assessed in primary schools using a
variety of tests and other methods.

All Irish primary schools must carry out three [ standardised tests of
students in English and Mathematics ](https://s3-eu-
west-1.amazonaws.com/govieassets/14911/56cab197b2c14c60a222cfdd4219c1ee.doc)
during primary school. They are tested:

  * At the end of first class or at the beginning of second class and 
  * At the end of fourth class 
  * At the beginning of sixth class 

The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment has published [ Assessment
in the Primary School Curriculum: Guidelines for Schools (pdf)
](https://www.ncca.ie/media/1351/assessment-guidelines.pdf) . It has also
published [ explanatory leaflets for parents about the standardised tests
](https://www.ncca.ie/en/primary/resources-for-parents#) .

Students will not be tested in special schools, if the school principal
considers that a student’s disability prevents them from attempting the test.
