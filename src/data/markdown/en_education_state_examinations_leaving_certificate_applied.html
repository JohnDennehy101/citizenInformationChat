##  What is the Leaving Certificate Applied?

The Leaving Certificate Applied (LCA) is a 2-year Leaving Certificate
programme which prepares students for adult and working life.

The programme helps students apply what they learn to the real world.

The 2-year programme consists of 4 half-year blocks called sessions.
Achievements are credited in each session.

The [ established Leaving Certificate ](/en/education/state-
examinations/leaving-certificate/) is a different programme covering a wide
range of subjects taken over 2 years.

You can read about the [ Assessment Arrangements For Junior Cycle and Leaving
Certificate Examinations 2025 (pdf)

. This document sets out the adjusted assessment arrangements for students
taking State examinations in the 2024/25 school year.

##  Leaving Certificate Applied courses

Courses are offered in 3 main areas:

  * Vocational preparation, involving work experience, enterprise and communication 
  * General education, offering life skills, the arts, social education, leisure and language 
  * Vocational education 

###  Course structure

Each course consists of a [ number of modules
](https://www.curriculumonline.ie/Senior-cycle/LCA/) . Each module takes place
over half a year. There is also a wide range of practical courses, called
vocational specialisms, from which the student can choose.

###  Assessment and examinations

Students are assessed continuously throughout the course and there is a final
examination.

Students are assessed on the completion of modules and practical activities
that allow you to integrate learning from different courses.

The final examination must be taken in:

  * English and communication 
  * Two vocational specialisms 
  * Mathematical applications 
  * Language 
  * Social education 

There are written and oral examinations in all languages. There are practical
examinations in the vocational specialisms. The written examinations usually
take place in June, at the same time as the examinations for the established
Leaving Certificate.

Since September 2022, students taking the LCA programme can choose to take the
established Leaving Certificate Mathematics and an established Leaving
Certificate Modern Language.

Read more about [ how the Leaving Cert Applied is assessed
](https://www.curriculumonline.ie/Senior-cycle/LCA/) .

###  The certificate awarded

Students who successfully complete the programme are awarded a Leaving
Certificate from the Department of Education. The certificate is awarded at
three levels:

Level  |  Marks and Credits Required   
---|---  
Pass  |  60-69% (120-139 credits)   
Merit  |  70-84% (140-169 credits)   
Distinction  |  85-100% (170-200 credits)   
  
Candidates who get less than 60% (120 credits) or who do not complete the
course, are awarded a record of experience.

##  Leaving Certificate Applied, further education and third-level

If you are awarded the Leaving Certificate Applied, you can go on to a wide
range of [ Post-Leaving Certificate courses (PLCs) ](/en/education/further-
education-and-training/post-leaving-certificate-courses/) . PLCs take place in
your Education and Training Board (ETB) schools, colleges and education
centres.

Courses offered include Art and Design, Business, Science, Services and
Leisure, and Communications and Media studies.

PLC courses can lead to an award recognised by the National Framework of
Qualifications (NFQ). You can [ find out if your course is recognised by NFQ
](http://www.qualifax.ie/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=19&Itemid=21)
.

Students cannot go directly to nursing but may be eligible to apply as a
mature student with certain qualifications or relevant experience.

Students with the Leaving Certificate Applied can also go on to [
apprenticeship programmes ](/en/education/further-education-and-
training/apprenticeships/) . Many students go directly to employment.

###  Leaving Certificate Applied and the CAO

Students with the Leaving Certificate Applied cannot gain direct entry through
the [ Central Applications Office (CAO) system ](/en/education/third-level-
education/applying-to-college/application-procedures-and-entry-requirements/)
to the universities or institutes of technology.

Many PLC courses lead to either a level 5 or level 6 award. In some cases, you
can progress with this award to a third level course in a higher education
institution such as an institute of technology or a university. You should
discuss your options for progression with your course provider.
