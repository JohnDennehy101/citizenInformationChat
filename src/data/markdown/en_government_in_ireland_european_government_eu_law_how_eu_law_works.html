##  Introduction

The primary laws of the [ European Union ](/en/government-in-ireland/european-
government/european-union/european-union/) (EU) are contained in the treaties
agreed between member states.

These treaties set out how the EU is structured and governed. They also give
powers to EU institutions to make and change secondary laws.

The EU has 3 legislative (or law making) institutions:

  * The [ European Commission ](/en/government-in-ireland/european-government/eu-institutions/european-commission/) proposes new laws 
  * These proposals must be passed by both the [ European Parliament ](/en/government-in-ireland/european-government/eu-institutions/european-parliament/) and the [ Council of the European Union ](/en/government-in-ireland/european-government/eu-institutions/council-of-the-european-union/)

Disputes about the interpretation of these laws may be referred to the [ Court
of Justice of the European Union ](/en/government-in-ireland/european-
government/eu-institutions/european-court-of-justice/) .

The EU uses 3 principles to decide in which areas it can make laws:

  * _Conferral_ – the EU’s authority is conferred on it by the Treaties. It cannot act beyond this authority 
  * _Proportionality_ – the EU should not go beyond what is necessary to achieve the aims of the Treaties 
  * _Subsidiarity_ – if national governments can act, then the EU should only act if a better outcome would result from an EU law 

##  The primacy of EU law

EU law is superior to national law. This means that Ireland (along with other
member states) cannot pass national laws that contradict EU laws. It also
means that an EU law can over-rule an Irish law, even if that Irish law was
enacted before the EU law came into effect.

###  **Direct effect**

As well as being superior to national law, some EU law has direct effect on
its citizens. This means that you can rely on EU law in court even in
situations where there is no national law in place. Direct effect only applies
to EU laws that are binding (see ‘Types of EU laws’ below), clear, precise and
unconditional.

##  How EU laws are made

The EU uses different procedures which depend on the type of law that is being
enacted.

###  The _ordinary legislative procedure_

This is the procedure used unless the treaties state that another procedure
should be used (see ‘Special legislative procedure’ below)

EU laws begin at the European Commission (this is called the _right of
initiative_ ). The European Commission _proposes_ laws, either of its own
choosing or based on consultations with other EU institutions, member states
or public consultations.

####  First reading

The proposed law is sent to the European Parliament for its first reading, and
is given to the relevant committee to examine. Amendments may be made to the
proposed law. The European Parliament votes to either:

  * Approve the proposal 
  * Approve the proposal with amendments 
  * Reject the proposal 

This is known as the _parliament’s first reading position_ .

At the same time, the proposal is also sent to the Council of the European
Union for its first reading. The Council takes its position (the _council’s
position_ ) after the parliament’s position is known. At this stage, the
Council can:

  * Approve the proposal by a _qualified majority_ . This may involve the Council accepting any amendments approved by the European Parliament. 
  * Take a 1st reading position of its own. This may be because it disagrees with some parts of the proposal, or the Parliament’s amendments. In this instance, the proposal is sent back to Parliament with reasons and explanations. 
  * Reject the proposal by a qualified majority. 

####  Qualified majority voting (QMV)

In order to have a decision passed by the Council:

  * At least 55% of member states must agree and 
  * The member states in agreement must represent at least 65% of the EU population 

To block the proposal at least 4 member states representing at least 35% of
the population of the EU must vote against it.

####  Second reading

If the proposal has been sent back to Parliament for a second reading,
Parliament may approve or reject it, or may propose amendments and send it
back to the Council for a second reading.

If Council does not accept these changes, a **Conciliation Committee** is
formed from an equal number of MEPs and Council representatives. This
Committee tries to agree on a text. If it succeeds, the proposal is sent back
to the Parliament and Councils for third readings **.**

At this stage, the text of the proposal cannot be amended. **It must be passed
by both the Parliament and the Council to pass into law** .

###  The _special legislative procedures_

In certain cases, the treaties allow for a different procedure than the
ordinary legislative procedure.

In some situations, the European Parliament and the Council of the European
Union must both pass a proposal without the power to make amendments.

####  Consent procedure

In this procedure, the Parliament and Council must pass the proposal before it
can become law, and neither institution has the power to amend the proposal.
This procedure is used where:

  * The EU needs the approval of the European Parliament but is not proposing legislation (for example, it wishes to sanction a member state for breaking EU rules) **or**
  * Where legislation on combating discrimination is proposed 

####  Consultation procedure

This is used in instances where the Treaties allow the Council to pass a law
without the law having to pass the European Parliament. The Parliament must
give its advice on the matter, but the Council may choose to pass the law even
if the Parliament advises against it.

####  Discharge procedure

This is used to assess the implementation of the approved budget by the
Commission. While the Council can offer a recommendation, the ultimate ability
to approve the implementation (the discharge) is made by the Parliament.

##  Types of EU Law

**_Treaties_ ** are the fundamental laws of the EU. All treaties must be
ratified (passed and agreed) by member states.

Treaties set out the rules for how the institutions of the EU function. The EU
was founded on a number of treaties, and its expansion and development has
been underpinned by the agreement of treaties between the member states.

[ **_The European Charter of Fundamental Rights_ ** ](/en/government-in-
ireland/european-government/eu-law/charter-of-fundamental-rights/) has the
same legal value as the treaties.

**_Regulations_ ** are laws that apply to all member states. They become part
of national law and can be enforced through the national courts of each member
state from the time they come into force.

**_Directives_ ** are laws that set goals for member states to implement.
Member states can introduce laws that _transpose_ directives into national
law. Directives normally have deadlines for countries to adopt them into
national law.

**_Decisions_ ** are only relevant to specified bodies. For example, the EU
Commission might issue a decision that Ireland is acting in breach of EU law.
The decision has a direct effect on the country, company or organisation that
the decision is issued against.

**_Recommendations_ ** and **_Opinions_ ** are not binding, and EU member
states can follow the advice of these recommendations if they wish to or they
can choose not to change anything.

##  EU laws and Ireland

The [ Constitution of Ireland ](/en/government-in-ireland/irish-
constitution-1/constitution-introduction/) recognises that EU law is superior
to all national law.

The EU is the only body that can pass laws regarding:

  * Customs union 
  * Competition rules in the single market 
  * Monetary policy in the Eurozone 
  * International trade agreements 
  * Marine plants and animals 

Membership of the EU has had a profound effect on Irish law. Some examples of
where EU regulations and directives have effected rights of Irish citizens are
below.

###  Worker’s rights

Many important employment laws in Ireland either began as or incorporated
aspects of EU directives or regulations. Some examples are:

[ Equality ](../../../employment/equality_in_work/equality_in_the_workplace.en.html) |  It is unlawful to discriminate in the workplace on certain grounds  |  The _Employment Equality Acts 1998 – 2015_ transposed and expanded upon [ Directive 2000/78 ](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex%3A32000L0078)  
---|---|---

[ Maternity leave ](../../../employment/employment_rights_and_conditions/leave_and_holidays/maternity_leave.en.html) |  Ireland’s maternity leave and maternity protection laws are based in part on EU directives  |  _Maternity Protection Act 1994_ transposed [ Directive 91/533/EEC ](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=CELEX%3A31991L0533)  
[ Parental Leave ](../../../employment/employment_rights_and_conditions/leave_and_holidays/parental_leave.en.html) |  Parents must be given leave from work regardless of their gender  |  _Parental Leave Acts 1998-2019_ transposed and expanded on [ Directive 96/34/EEC ](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=CELEX%3A31996L0034)  
[ The working week ](../../../employment/employment_rights_and_conditions/hours_of_work/working_week.en.html) |  Maximum working hours, rest periods, breaks and annual leave entitlements  |  _Organisation of Working Time Act 1997_ transposed [ Directive 2003/88/EC ](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex%3A32003L0088)

###  Environment

Many of Ireland’s environmental laws have come from the EU, including the
rights of access to information on environmental matters and public
participation in environmental decisions under the [ Aarhus Convention
](/en/environment/environment-and-the-law/aarhus-convention/) .

Ireland also has targets to reduce emissions that have been set as part of its
membership of the EU and through the Kyoto Protocol.

The European Court of Justice has made important rulings regarding Ireland’s
management of its environment.

You can read more on ‘ [ European environmental law
](/en/environment/environment-and-the-law/eu-environmental-law/) ’.

###  Consumer

Consumers are protected under EU law when purchasing goods and services from
other EU countries. Read more about this in ‘ [ Consumer rights in the
European Union’
](/consumer/consumer_laws/your_rights_as_consumer_in_ireland.html ) .
