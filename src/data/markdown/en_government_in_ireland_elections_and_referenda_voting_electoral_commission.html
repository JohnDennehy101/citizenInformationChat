##  Who regulates elections in Ireland?

An Coimisiún Toghcháin (the Electoral Commission) is the independent statutory
body that oversees elections in Ireland.

Established on 9 February 2023, the make-up and functions of the Commission
are set out in [ The Electoral Reform Act 2022
](https://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2022/act/30/enacted/en/print.html) .

An Coimisiún Toghcháin has [ replaced the Referendum Commission
](https://www.electoralcommission.ie/our-work-on-referendums/) .

##  Functions of An Coimisiún Toghcháin

The functions of the Commission are set out in the [ Electoral Reform Act 2022
](https://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2022/act/30/enacted/en/print#sec30) ,
and include:

  * Informing the public about [ referendums ](/en/government-in-ireland/elections-and-referenda/types-of-elections-and-referendums/constitutional-referendum-in-ireland/)
  * Reviewing constituencies and constituency boundaries for general, European and local elections 
  * Telling the public about how to vote and encouraging people to vote in referendums and elections 
  * Maintaining the [ Register of Political Parties ](/en/government-in-ireland/elections-and-referenda/running-for-office/registering-a-political-party/)

  * Regulating online political advertising 

###  **Constituency review 2023**

In August 2023, An Coimisiún Toghcháin published its [ review of Ireland's
electoral constituencies ](https://www.electoralcommission.ie/constituency-
reviews.html) . The report recommends that:

  * The number of TDs in [ Dáil Eireann ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/government-in-ireland/houses-of-the-oireachtas/dail-eireann/) is increased to 174 (from 160) 
  * The number of Dáil constituencies is increased to 43 (from 39) 

These changes will not take place without legislation. You can read the [ full
report and its recommendations (pdf) ](https://ec-report.s3.eu-
