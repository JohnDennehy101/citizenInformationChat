##  Leaving A Gift In Your Will

Donating to the Irish Kidney Association is a meaningful and enduring act of
generosity. Your gift will continue to benefit renal patients and their
families and carers, living with and affected by end-stage renal disease
throughout Ireland, ensuring your legacy creates positive change for years to
come.

We have teamed up with FreeWill.ie to provide you with a free online service
