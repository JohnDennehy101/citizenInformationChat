#  Children and rights in Ireland

  * Introduction 
  * Education and employment 
  * Travel and recreation 
  * Health and relationships 
  * Legal rights 
  * Further information 

##  Introduction

In Ireland under the [ Child Care Act 1991
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1991/en/act/pub/0017/index.html) , the [
Children Act 2001
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2001/en/act/pub/0024/index.html) and the [
United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child
](http://www.ohchr.org/EN/ProfessionalInterest/Pages/CRC.aspx) a child is
defined as anyone under the age of 18. What a child is allowed to do is
restricted by their age.

##  Education and employment

###  Education system

The Irish education system is made up of primary, second-level, third-level
and further education. Children can attend primary school from the age of 4.
To attend second-level they must be aged 12 on 1 January in the first school
year of attendance.

There is also an [ Early Childhood Care and Education Scheme
](/en/education/pre-school-education-and-childcare/early-childhood-care-and-
education-scheme/) for children of pre-school age. To be eligible for the
scheme they must be at least 2 years and 8 months of age.

###  School attendance

Attendance at school (or receiving an education) is compulsory from the age of
6 up to age 16 or until students have completed 3 years of second-level
education, whichever is the later.

There is no compulsory [ early childhood education ](/en/education/pre-school-
education-and-childcare/early-childhood-education/) .

[ Tusla - the Child and Family Agency ](http://www.tusla.ie/) is the national
agency established to ensure that every child attends school regularly, or
otherwise receives an appropriate minimum education. The Board:

  * Monitors school attendance, and takes a range of measures where children do not attend school 
  * Maintains a register of children who are not attending a recognised school 
  * Maintains a register of children aged 16 and 17 who leave school early to take up employment and makes arrangements for their continuing education and training in consultation with providers and employers 

Parents and guardians have a legal obligation to ensure that their child
attends a school or otherwise receives an education. If Tusla considers that
the parents are failing in their obligation, it sends the parents a School
Attendance Notice warning and if the parents fail to comply, they may be
prosecuted. Further information is available in our document on [ school
attendance ](/en/education/primary-and-post-primary-education/attendance-and-
discipline-in-schools/school-attendance/) .

The Board also intervenes in relation to proposed school expulsions.

Further information is available in our page, [ Overview of the Irish
education system ](/en/education/the-irish-education-system/overview-of-the-
irish-education-system/) .

###  Working

The law sets out different rules for young workers, depending on your age.
Workers aged 14 and 15 are classed as ‘children’. Workers aged 16 and 17 are
classed as ‘young persons’.

Under the [ Protection of Young Persons (Employment) Act 1996
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1996/en/act/pub/0016/index.html) employers
cannot employ children under age 16 in regular full-time jobs. Children under
age 14 cannot be employed. Children aged 14 and 15 may be employed as follows:

  * Doing light work during the school holidays – they must have at least 21 days off work during this time 
  * As part of an approved work experience or educational programme where the work is not harmful to their health, safety or development 
  * In film, cultural, advertising work or sport under licences issued by the government. 

Children aged 15 may do 8 hours a week light work in school term time. The
maximum working week for children outside school term time is 35 hours or up
to 40 hours if they are on approved work experience.

The maximum working week for children aged 16 and 17 is 40 hours with a
maximum of 8 hours a day.

Further information is available in our pages [ Hours of work for young people
](/en/employment/starting-work-and-changing-job/young-people-at-work/working-
hours-rest-breaks-young-people/) and [ Rights of young workers
](/en/employment/starting-work-and-changing-job/young-people-at-work/rights-
of-young-workers/) .

###  Minimum wage

The [ National Minimum Wage Act 2000
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2000/en/act/pub/0005/index.html) provides for
the minimum wage rate. From 1 January 2024, the national minimum wage rate is
€12.70 an hour. Wage rates are based on age, for example, an employee under
age 18 is entitled to €8.89 per hour or 70% of the minimum wage. An employee
aged 18 is entitled to €10.16 or 80% of the minimum wage, and an employee aged
19 is entitled to €11.43 or 90% of the minimum wage.

An employer can pay more and this should be written in your contract of
employment.

You can find out more about the National Minimum Wage in our page [ Minimum
rates of pay in Ireland ](/en/employment/employment-rights-and-conditions/pay-
and-employment/minimum-wage/) .

###  Apprenticeships and other careers

The minimum age you can pursue certain careers is as follows:

  * You can become a SOLAS apprentice at age 16 
  * You can become an apprentice in the Army or Air Corps at age 18 
  * You can join the Army, Air Corps and Naval Service at age 18 
  * You can join the Garda Síochána at age 18 

###  Babysitting

There is no legal minimum age for babysitting. (The babysitter's level of
maturity and competence are the main attributes a parent should consider)

###  Unemployment payments

When working, you start paying [ social insurance contributions ](/en/social-
welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/social-insurance-prsi/social-insurance/)
from 16 years of age. However, you cannot claim an unemployment payment, such
as [ Jobseeker’s Benefit ](/en/social-welfare/unemployed-people/jobseekers-
benefit/) or [ Jobseeker’s Allowance ](/en/social-welfare/unemployed-
people/jobseekers-allowance/) , until age 18. You must also meet other
criteria in order to qualify.

###  Tax

There is no minimum age at which you are liable to pay [ tax ](/en/money-and-
tax/tax/income-tax/how-your-tax-is-calculated/) or the [ Universal Social
Charge ](/en/money-and-tax/tax/income-tax/universal-social-charge/) .

##  Travel and recreation

###  Motoring

There are certain [ categories of vehicles ](/en/travel-and-
recreation/motoring/driver-licensing/categories-of-motor-vehicles-and-minimum-
age-of-drivers-in-ireland/) that a child under 18 is permitted to drive
provided they have a [ learner permit or driving licence ](/en/travel-and-
recreation/motoring/driver-licensing/) . The categories are:

**Vehicle categories** **Category** |  **Vehicle type** |  **Minimum age of driver**  
---|---|---  
AM  |  Mopeds and tricycles with a maximum speed of 45kph and light quadricycles  |  16 years   
A1  |  Motorcycles of 11kW or less and 125cc or less, with a maximum power/weight ratio of 0.1kW/kg, and motor tricycles of 15kW or less  |  16 years   
B  |  Vehicles with seats for up to 8 passengers and a maximum weight of 3,500kg (includes pulling a trailer where the maximum weight of the trailer when fully loaded is 750kg or less)  |  17 years   
W  |  Work vehicles with or without a trailer, such as a land tractor or JCB  |  16 years   
  
You must pass the [ driver theory test ](/en/travel-and-
recreation/motoring/driving-tests/driver-theory-test/) before applying for a
first learner permit. You can take a driver theory test at any age. However,
you must apply for your first learner permit within two years of passing the
theory test or the test certificate will have expired. If you have a [ Public
Services Card (PSC) ](https://psc.gov.ie/) and a verified [ MyGovID account
](https://www.mygovid.ie/en-IE/HowDoISignUp) , you can [ apply for your first
learner permit online ](https://www.ndls.ie/learner-driver/my-first-learner-
permit.html) .

Alternatively, you can visit an [ NDLS centre ](https://www.ndls.ie/how-to-
apply/applying-in-person.html#centre-locations) and make an application in
person.

###  Boating

You cannot drive any craft with an engine over 3.7kW (5hp) unless you are at
least 12 years of age.

You have to be at least 16 years of age before you can drive a personal
watercraft (jet ski) or a powerboat/motorboat that is capable of 17 knots or
more.

###  Travelling abroad

Children cannot book a holiday or a flight until they are 18 years of age.
Many carriers will not allow children under 16 years of age to travel
unaccompanied – contact your carrier to check what its policy is.

A child under 18 years of age must have their own passport to travel. If your
child has never had a passport before, or if their last passport was issued
more than 15 years ago, you need to apply on their behalf as a first-time
applicant.

[ Passports for children ](/en/travel-and-recreation/passports/passports-for-
children/) under 18 years of age are valid for 5 years. Parental consent is
required when applying. You can make a [ first-time application online for a
passport ](https://www.ireland.ie/en/dfa/passports/passport-online/) for
someone under 18 years of age from anywhere in the world using [ Passport
Online ](https://www.ireland.ie/en/dfa/passports/passport-online/) .

You can also use [ Passport Online
](https://www.ireland.ie/en/dfa/passports/passport-online/) to [ renew a
child's passport online ](https://www.ireland.ie/en/dfa/passports/how-to-
apply-for-a-passport/renew-child-passport/) .

You can apply for a ten-year passport when you are 18 years of age or over.

###  Alcohol

Under the [ Intoxicating Liquor Act 2003
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2003/act/31/section/13/enacted/en/index.html)
, it is an offence to buy alcohol or for someone to buy it for you, if you are
under age 18. It is also an offence for you to drink alcohol unless you are in
a private residence and have your parents’ consent.

It is an offence for you to be in an off-licence unless you are with a parent
or guardian.

Children are only allowed on licensed premises if they are with a parent or
guardian, but this provision carries certain restrictions. If accompanied by a
parent/guardian, a child may remain on the premises up to 9pm (10pm from May
to September) unless the licence holder feels this is harmful to the child's
health, safety and welfare. Children aged between 15-17 years may remain on
the premises after 9pm where they are attending a private function at which a
substantial meal is served.

Under the [ Intoxicating Liquor Act 2008
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2008/en/act/pub/0017/sec0014.html) the Gardaí
have the power to seize alcohol in the possession of a child under 18 years of
age where the Gardaí have reasonable cause to believe that the alcohol will be
consumed by a child under 18 years in a public place.

Further information is available in our document [ Alcohol and the law
](/en/justice/criminal-law/criminal-offences/alcohol-and-the-law/) .

###  Cigarettes

Under the [ Public Health (Tobacco) Act 2002
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2002/en/act/pub/0006/index.html) it is an
offence to sell cigarettes or other tobacco products to anyone under the age
of 18.

If you are under 18 years of age, you cannot smoke in a car. Also, no one else
can smoke while you are in the car.

###  Vaping

It is an offence to sell nicotine inhaling products such as e-cigarettes
(commonly referred to as vapes) to anyone under the age of 18.

###  Gambling

You cannot buy a Lotto ticket or make a bet until you are 18 years of age.
Under the [ Betting Act 1931
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1931/en/act/pub/0027/index.html) it is an
offence for a child under age 18 to be in a bookmakers. Under the [ Gaming and
Lotteries (Amendment) Act 2019
](https://eur03.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.irishstatutebook.ie%2Feli%2F2020%2Fsi%2F227%2Fmade%2Fen%2Fpdf&data=02%7C01%7CSean.Donnelly%40ciboard.ie%7Ce9ff2c21a03c4ecceca708d81d0bcdd2%7Cbb4e61ce39a3414abb5d6a0290c95fd9%7C1%7C0%7C637291283869479767&sdata=56AHypab4Z3zqBtV9Nq1l19DoDF2cW5HFGOBvvGLf0U%3D&reserved=0)
, you must be 18 to engage in gaming at an amusement hall or funfair.

###  Films and computer games

####  **Films**

What films you can watch in the cinema depends on the film’s classification.
The film classifications currently in use are as follows:

  * G: The film is suitable for everyone including children of school going age 
  * PG: While the film may be watched by unaccompanied children, parental guidance is recommended as to its suitability for children under 12 years of age 
  * 12A: While the film is considered suitable only for children aged 12 or over, a child under age 12 may be admitted to see the film if he/she is accompanied by a parent or guardian 
  * 15A: While the film is considered suitable only for children aged 15 or over, a child under age 15 may be admitted to see the film if he/she is accompanied by a parent or guardian 
  * 16: The film is considered to be suitable for children aged 16 or over. Children under this age cannot be admitted to screenings 
  * 18: The film is considered suitable for persons age 18 or over 

####  **Computer games**

Ireland uses the [ Pan-European Game Information (PEGI)
](https://pegi.info/what-do-the-labels-mean) age rating system for the
classification of computer games. It is a voluntary system that retailers
selling computer games are expected to follow. The classifications are as
follows:

  * 3+: The game content is suitable for all age groups 
  * 7+: The game content is suitable for children aged 7 or over 
  * 12+: The game content is suitable for children aged 12 or over 
  * 16+: The game content is suitable for children aged 16 or over 
  * 18+: The game content is suitable for people aged 18 or over 

The age rating does not take into account the difficulty level or skills
required to play a game.

You can read more about [ censorship of films, DVDs and computer games
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/government-in-ireland/irish-
constitution-1/censorship/#07e0c3) .

###  Pet ownership

Under the [ Control of Dogs Act 1986
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1986/en/act/pub/0032/index.html) you cannot
keep a dog unless you have a [ dog licence ](/en/environment/pets-and-
wildlife/control-of-dogs/) for it and the dog is microchipped. A local
authority does not issue a dog licence to anyone under 16 years of age.

If you have your dog out in public you must keep it under control, such as on
a lead. Certain breeds of dog must be muzzled at all times in public. These
dogs must be led by someone over the age of 16 and kept on a strong chain or
lead that is no longer than 2 metres.

You do not require a licence to own other pets and there is no legislation
specifying a minimum age at which you can own a pet.

###  Horse ownership

Horses may not be sold to anyone under 16 years of age. If a person under 16
owns a horse, the head of the household in which they live is considered to be
the owner.

You must have a [ horse license ](/en/environment/pets-and-wildlife/control-
of-horses/) if your horse is kept in a control area. A control area is a place
that is designated by a local authority in their Control of Horses Byelaws.

###  Drones and model aircraft

You must be over 16 years of age to register as a drone operator.

Drones and model aircraft weighing more than 250g and less than 25kg, must be
registered with the [ Irish Aviation Authority ](https://www.iaa.ie/general-
aviation/drones/drone-register) (IAA). To fly a drone that weighs more than
25kg, you must apply for an Operational Authorisation from the Irish Aviation
Authority. When calculating the weight, fuel is not included. However, any
articles or equipment installed in or attached to the aircraft at the start of
its flight, including cargo, are included. For more information, read more on
[ Owning and operating drones in Ireland ](/en/travel-and-recreation/sport-
and-leisure/owning-and-operating-a-drone/) .

###  Firearms

You have to be aged 16 or over before you can apply for a firearms
certificate. You have to be aged 14 or over before you can apply for a
firearms training certificate. A firearms training certificate does not allow
you to own a firearm but it does allow you to possess a firearm while carrying
and using it under the supervision of the person who holds a firearm
certificate for that firearm and is over 18 years of age.

The requirement to have a firearm certificate also applies to crossbows,
spearguns and all airguns above a certain muzzle velocity (including paintball
markers).

###  Knives

There is no set minimum age at which you can own a knife. However, it is an
offence to have a knife in a public place without a good reason, such as for
work.

##  Health and relationships

###  Health services

There is a range of services specifically for children and certain services
are provided free of charge even if their parents do not have a medical card.
These services are generally provided as part of [ maternity and infant
welfare services ](/en/health/health-services/reproductive_health/maternity-
and-infant-welfare-services/) , [ health services for preschool children
](/en/health/health-services/children-s-health/health-services-for-preschool-
children/) and [ school health services ](/en/health/health-services/children-
s-health/school-health-services/) . Children are also entitled to [
vaccination and immunisation services ](/en/health/health-services/children-s-
health/vaccinations-for-children/) free of charge. You can also find out about
[ unplanned pregnancy ](/en/health/health-
services/reproductive_health/unplanned-pregnancy/) , [ reproductive health and
the services and supports available ](/en/health/health-
services/reproductive_health/) .

###  Surgical procedures

In general, parental consent is required for children to have medical and
surgical tests and procedures and to receive vaccinations and inoculations.
Under the [ Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act 1997
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1997/en/act/pub/0026/sec0023.html#zza26y1997s23)
, children aged 16 and over may themselves give consent to surgical
procedures.

###  Body piercing and tattooing

There is no legislation regulating body piercing and tattooing. As a result
there is no legal minimum age at which you can get a body piercing or tattoo.

###  Teeth whitening

Under [ Directive 2011/84/EU of 20 September 2011 (pdf) ](http://eur-
lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2011:283:0036:0038:en:PDF) you
must be aged 18 or over to have your teeth whitened.

###  Sunbeds

Under the [ Public Health (Sunbeds) Act 2014
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2014/en/act/pub/0012/index.html) you must be
aged 18 or over to use a sunbed.

###  Giving blood

You cannot become a blood donor until you are aged 18.

###  Contraceptive services

There is no set minimum age in Ireland at which [ contraceptive advice and
prescriptions ](/en/health/health-services/reproductive_health/contraception/)
may be provided. The age of consent to sexual activity is 17 and it may be a
criminal offence to have sex with a person under 17 years of age. This means
that providers of contraceptive services are entitled to refuse to provide
those services to people under 17.

###  Sexual activity

Under [ Section 3 of the Criminal Law (Sex Offences) Act 2006
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2006/act/15/section/3/enacted/en/html#sec3)
as amended by [ Section 5 of the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) (Amendment)
Act 2007
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2007/act/6/section/5/enacted/en/html#sec5)
it is a criminal offence to engage or attempt to engage in a sexual act with a
child under 17 years of age. It is not a defence to show that the child
consented to the sexual act. However, the [ Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act
2017 ](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2017/act/2/enacted/en/html)
recognises the reality of under age, consensual, peer relationships through
the introduction of a ‘proximity of age’ defence. Under this provision, a
person charged with an offence of engaging in a sexual act with a person
between the ages of 15 and 17 years can use consent as a defence if the person
charged is younger or is less than two years older. They must not be in
authority over the child or be intimidatory or exploitative.

The consent of the [ Director of Public Prosecutions
](http://www.dppireland.ie/) is required for any prosecution of a child under
the age of 17 years for this offence. A girl under the age of 17 who has
sexual intercourse may not be convicted of an offence on that ground alone.

It is an offence for a person in authority to engage or attempt to engage in a
sexual act with a child under 18 years of age.

###  Recognition of preferred gender

An application can be made for a [ gender recognition certificate
](https://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/GRC1.aspx) on behalf of a child aged 16
years or over if a court order is obtained that exempts the child from meeting
the age requirement. You can read more in our document on the [ Legal
recognition of your preferred gender ](/en/birth-family-relationships/legal-
recognition-of-preferred-gender/) .

###  Marriage

If you are ordinarily resident in Ireland, the minimum age at which you can
marry is 18 years. This is the case even if you marry outside of Ireland.

Further information is available in our documents on [ the legal requirements
for marriage ](/en/birth-family-relationships/getting-married/legal-
requirements-for-marriage/) .

###  Maintenance

A parent is required to maintain a dependent child. A dependent child is a
child who:

  * Is under 18 years old or 
  * Is over 18 and under 23 years old but is still in full-time education 

If a court decides that the parent of a dependent child has failed to provide
maintenance for the child as is _proper in the circumstances_ , it may order
that parent to make periodical maintenance payments to support the child. The
court may also order a parent to pay a lump sum.

Further information is available in our documents, [ Maintenance orders and
agreements ](/en/birth-family-relationships/separation-and-
divorce/maintenance-orders-and-agreements/) and [ Maintenance and unmarried
couples ](/en/birth-family-relationships/parenting-alone/maintenance-lone-
parents/) .

###  Leaving home

You can leave home at age 16, provided you have your parents’ consent. No
consent is required at age 18.

If you leave home before you are 18 without your parents’ consent and you are
considered to be homeless or at risk, [ Tusla ](http://www.tusla.ie/) may be
asked to intervene. you can read more information on the powers available to
Tusla in our document [ Children in care ](/en/birth-family-
relationships/services-and-supports-for-children/children-in-care/) .

###  Tracing your birth family or relatives

If you are adopted and wish to have contact or share information with your
birth family, you can have your details entered in the [ Contact Preference
Register ](https://www.birthinfo.ie/what-options-do-i-have/register-or-update-
my-contact-preferences) under the Birth Information and Tracing Act 2022.
However, you must be 18 years of age or over. If you are an adopted child
under 18, an adoptive parent may join on your behalf.

##  Legal rights

###  Criminal responsibility

The age of criminal responsibility is 12 years of age. This means that
children who have not reached the age of 12 cannot be charged with an offence.
There is an exception, however, for children aged 10 or 11, who can be charged
with murder, manslaughter, rape or aggravated sexual assault.

Where a child under 14 years of age is charged with an offence, no further
proceedings can be taken without the consent of the [ Director of Public
Prosecutions ](http://www.dppireland.ie/) .

**Children under 12  
** Where the Gardaí have reasonable grounds for believing that a child under
12 years of age has committed an offence with which the child cannot be
charged due to his/her age, the Gardaí must take the child to his/her parents
or guardian. Where this is not possible, the Gardaí will arrange for the child
to be taken into the custody of the [ Child and Family Agency (Tusla)
](http://www.tusla.ie/) services for the area in which the child normally
resides. It is possible that children under 12 years of age who commit
criminal offences will be dealt with by Tusla and not the criminal justice
system. Information on the powers available to Tusla is available in our
document, [ Children in care ](/en/birth-family-relationships/services-and-
supports-for-children/children-in-care/) .

###  Detention in a Garda station

When a child is [ detained in a Garda station ](/en/justice/children-and-
young-offenders/treatment-of-child-suspects-in-garda-custody/) it is the duty
of the Garda in charge of the station to ensure that, as far as possible, the
child is not allowed meet with or associate with adult suspects being detained
in the station at the same time. A child may not be interviewed in a Garda
station except in the presence of his/her parent or guardian. It may be
permitted where there are very special circumstances, for example, where a
delay in questioning would involve a risk of death or injury.

###  Children Court

Children being charged with a crime are dealt with by the [ Children Court
](/en/justice/courts-system/children-court/) . The court can impose a period
of detention on a child. Children between the ages of 10 and 17 sentenced by
the courts to a period of detention are sent to the [ Oberstown Children
Detention Campus ](https://www.oberstown.com/) . The court can only impose a
detention order where it is satisfied that it is the only suitable way to deal
with the child and a place in a children detention school is available.
Oberstown is funded by the [ Irish Youth Justice Service
](http://www.iyjs.ie/en/IYJS/Pages/Home) . People aged 18 years or over may be
sent to prison.

Apart from detention there are also diversion programmes and community
sanctions available to the court.

There is more information on children and the criminal justice system in our
section on [ children and young offenders ](/en/justice/children-and-young-
offenders/) .

###  Elections

In order to vote in an [ election or referendum ](/en/government-in-
ireland/elections-and-referenda/) in Ireland, you must be [ registered to vote
](/en/government-in-ireland/elections-and-referenda/voting/registering-to-
vote/) . To be eligible to be included on the Register of Electors, you must
be at least 18 years old and ordinarily resident in Ireland at the time of
making the application.

If you are 16 or 17 years old, you can apply to be included in the 'pending
elector list' but you are not entitled to vote until you reach 18, at which
point you will automatically be added to the Register of Electors. In the
event that an election is called, if you are included in the pending elector
list you will be included in the Register of Electors in force for that
election even if you turn 18 on polling day.

The pending elector list is not part of the register, and it is not available
for inspection.

You cannot stand as a candidate in an election until you are at least 18 years
of age. You must be:

  * Age 18 for local elections 
  * Age 21 for national and European elections 
  * Age 35 for presidential elections 

###  Contracts

You cannot enter a legally binding contract until you are aged 18. The
exception to this is _contracts for necessaries_ and _beneficial contracts of
service_ which are in your best interests. _Contracts for necessaries_ usually
include contracts for food, clothing and lodging, but may also cover contracts
for items connected with education and training such as school books and
training uniforms.

Beneficial contracts of service usually involve contracts for apprenticeships
or contracts with agents or managers. These contracts of service are only
enforceable if they are to your advantage and in your best interests.

###  Bank accounts

Accounts for children of primary school age are usually simple, easy to use
savings or deposit accounts. You can open them with a very small amount of
money.

Accounts for secondary school students usually offer ATM cards or debit cards,
but you have to keep the account in credit at all times. They do not offer an
overdraft facility and there is a limit to how much you can withdraw. Usually
you do not have to pay transaction fees and charges.

You cannot open a standard current account until you are aged 18.

When opening an account each provider has different procedures. Some providers
require that a parent or guardian sign the account opening form if you are
under 16 years of age. Other providers only require parental permission if you
are under 13 years of age.

More information is available in our documents [ Opening and switching a bank
account ](/en/money-and-tax/personal-finance/banking/opening-a-bank-account/)
and [ Basic Bank Accounts ](/en/money-and-tax/personal-
finance/banking/standard-bank-account/) .

###  Jury service

You cannot [ sit on a jury in a court ](/en/justice/courtroom/jury-service/)
until you are aged 18. If you are 18 and your name is on the [ Register of
Electors ](/en/government-in-ireland/elections-and-
referenda/voting/registering-to-vote#l82302) the day the Register comes into
force (15 February), you may be eligible for [ jury service
](/en/justice/courtroom/jury-service/) . You can add your name to the draft
Register before you turn 18.

###  Making a will

You cannot [ make a will ](/en/death/before-a-death/making-a-will/) until you
are aged 18.

###  Changing your name

The surname of a child can be changed in the [ Register of Births ](/en/birth-
family-relationships/after-your-baby-is-born/registering-birth-your-baby/) but
only in certain circumstances. However, the surname of a child can also be
changed by deed poll or common usage.

Children aged between 14 and 17 years can execute the Deed Poll themselves but
need the consent of both parents. Where a child is under the age of 14 years,
one of the child's parents must execute the Deed Poll with the consent of the
other parent.

You can [ change your name by deed poll ](/en/birth-family-
relationships/problems-in-marriages-and-other-relationships/changing-your-
name/) without consent when you are aged 18 or over.
