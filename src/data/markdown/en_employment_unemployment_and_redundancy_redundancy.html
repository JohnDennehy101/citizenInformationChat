#  Redundancy

  * [ What is redundancy? ](/en/employment/unemployment-and-redundancy/redundancy/what-is-redundancy/)

Where you lose your job because your employer is closing the business or
reducing the number of staff, this is known as redundancy.

  * [ Being selected for redundancy ](/en/employment/unemployment-and-redundancy/redundancy/redundancy-procedures/)

Your employer should use a fair and objective way of selecting people to make
redundant.

  * [ Alternatives to redundancy ](/en/employment/unemployment-and-redundancy/redundancy/alternatives-to-redundancy/)

Before your employer makes you redundant, they might offer you another job in
the business. This is known as ‘alternative work’.

  * [ Redundancy notice periods ](/en/employment/unemployment-and-redundancy/redundancy/redundancy-notice-periods/)

If you are being made redundant, your job won’t end straight away. By law, you
are entitled to a minimum paid notice period.

  * [ Do I have a right to redundancy pay? ](/en/employment/unemployment-and-redundancy/redundancy/right-to-redundancy-pay/)

If you lose your job you may be eligible for redundancy pay. This page
summarises the rules on qualifying for a redundancy payment.

  * [ How much redundancy pay will I get? ](/en/employment/unemployment-and-redundancy/redundancy/redundancy-payments/)

Find out about redundancy pay and how your statutory redundancy is calculated.

  * [ Problems getting your redundancy pay ](/en/employment/unemployment-and-redundancy/redundancy/problems-getting-redundancy-pay/)

Your employer should pay the redundancy lump sum to you when your employment
ends. Get advice if you are having problems getting your redundancy pay.

  * [ Lay-off, short-time working and redundancy ](/en/employment/unemployment-and-redundancy/redundancy/lay-off-short-time-working-and-redundancy/)

If your employer has no work available for you, or less work available than
usual, you may be put on a lay off or short time working arrangement.

  * [ Worksheet on calculating your redundancy payment ](/en/employment/unemployment-and-redundancy/redundancy/worksheet-on-calculating-your-redundancy-payment/)

Your redundancy lump sum is calculated according a certain formula based on
your years of service in an employment. This worksheet is to help you work it
out for yourself.

  * [ Taxation of lump sum payments ](/en/employment/retirement/income-tax-in-retirement/retirement-lump-sum-taxation/)

Lump sum payments in compensation for loss of employment are subject to tax.
How is tax calculated and what are your entitlements?
