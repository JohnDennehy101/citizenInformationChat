##  Introduction

[ Zero Emission Vehicles Ireland ](https://www.gov.ie/en/campaigns/18b95-zero-
emission-vehicles-ireland/) has a target under the [ Climate Action Plan 2023
](https://secure-
web.cisco.com/1INdjmADUN0qMhFXRVrRa3f23SPSTAiW1-rjBP2x5FS4cYLvOsJUu6-j0qgGNcXuYmBpuzpLQKyAB2Oq5rM7saIEfPeR5FZmbMekqY7EZav7Ne4-uB0wt6DYTTyelKJ-
toG0bdRkCDy-R7qFFk0AFi23Zzp03RNe1b1IycPwfESfk-OS5G9A3xUKXFi-
AdqO91zyeyixZsfiLfUXBVJiKG2wzfJ1XplcCenJJuE-
FYBoETXMdRRaeCE4TYIZHAp_mZ8USQcRIIMvZcS9RFHKyvH_LiU8sZIi2psorB9llxnH-
cc3TCEw_bgwnsUJJFtnb/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gov.ie%2Fen%2Fpublication%2F7bd8c-climate-
action-plan-2023%2F) to have 30% of our private car fleet switched to electric
by 2030.  This page gives an overview of some of the grant supports and
information available for electric vehicle owners and buyers.  An electric
vehicle (EV) has an electric motor that is powered by a battery which is
charged by an external source of electricity.  There are 2 main types of EVs:

  * Battery electric vehicles (BEVs) –are powered by a battery only. 
  * Hybrid electric vehicles –have an engine and electric motor – one powered by a battery and the other is fuel-powered and generally uses petrol or diesel. 

##  Electric vehicle grants

You may be able to get a grant from the Sustainable Energy Authority Ireland
(SEAI) if you buy a battery-powered electric vehicle (BEV) that meets specific
standards.  Since 1 July 2023, [ you can get a grant of up to €3,500 for
battery-powered electric vehicles (BEV) ](https://www.seai.ie/grants/electric-
vehicle-grants/grant-amounts/) . (Previously, the grant was €5,000).  The
grant for BEVs only applies to new cars with a full price of between €14,000
and €60,000.  Your car dealer will apply for the grant for you, and then
deduct the grant amount from the total price of your car.  The grant of €2,500
for plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEV) has been removed.

###  **Electric vehicle grants for taxis, hackneys, and limousines (SPSV)**

If you drive a small public service vehicle (SPSV), you may get a grant from
the National Transport Authority (NTA). Grants of up to €20,000 or €25,000 for
wheelchair accessible EV’s are available. The amount of the grant you get
depends on the car’s age, specifications, and mileage.  The application
closing date is 13 December 2024 or earlier if notified by the NTA or if no
more funding is available. You can find out more information on the [ National
Transport Authority website ](https://www.nationaltransport.ie/taxi/forms-and-
guides/) .

###  **Electric vehicle grants for heavy duty vehicles**

If your business wants to buy zero-emission heavy-duty vehicles (ZEHDVs), you
may qualify for a grant. The Zero-Emission Heavy Duty Vehicle Purchase Grant
Scheme offers grants to help companies buy ZEHDVs instead of diesel vehicles.
The grant amount is calculated as a percentage of the price difference between
the ZEHDV and a diesel version.  The amount of grant you get depends on the
vehicle type, the size of your company and whether you have received previous
grants under the scheme. The maximum amount of funding available is €500,000.
To apply, complete the application form and submit it by email to [
zehdvgrant@pierse.ie ](mailto:zehdvgrant@pierse.ie) . More information,
including the scheme rules and calculation examples, is available on the [
Transport Infrastructure Ireland website ](https://www.tii.ie/en/roads-
tolling/alt-fuel-projects-unit/zero-emission-heavy-duty/) .

##  Electric vehicle home charging grants

###  Home Charger Grant Scheme

Since 1 January 2024, you can also apply for the [ Home Charger Grant Scheme
](https://www.seai.ie/grants/electric-vehicle-grants/electric-vehicle-home-
charger-grant/) , for up to €300 towards the installation costs of a home
charger. (Previously, the grant was €600).

###  EV Apartment Charging Grant

The [ EV Apartment Charging Grant ](https://www.seai.ie/grants/electric-
vehicle-grants/apartment-charging-grant/) is for dwellings which do not have
access to a driveway such as apartments, duplexes as well as mixed
developments.

###

###  Charging an electric vehicle away from home

External charge points throughout the country are available through the [ ESB
ecars network ](https://esbecars.esb.ie/ecars/charge-point-map) . There are
several private charge point operators with sites in Ireland.

##  Motor tax

The annual [ motor tax ](/en/travel-and-recreation/motoring/motor-tax-and-
insurance/motor-tax-rates/) rate for an electric vehicle is €120 per year for
a Battery Electric Vehicle. Electric vehicles are the lowest tax band for
motor tax.
