#  Adult literacy

  * What is literacy? 
  * How can I improve my literacy? 
  * Your local Education and Training Board (ETB) 
  * National Adult Literacy Agency (NALA) 

##  What is literacy?

Literacy is more than just reading and writing. Literacy skills include:

  * Listening 
  * Speaking 
  * Using numbers 
  * Using everyday technology 

We all need literacy skills to communicate, access services, and make informed
choices. Literacy skills help us to enjoy a good quality of life within our
families, in our communities, and at work.

###  **Literacy and numeracy challenges in Ireland**

Many adults in Ireland feel they could improve their reading, writing, maths,
and digital skills.

  * 1 in 6 Irish adults finds reading and understanding everyday texts difficult. 
  * 1 in 4 Irish adults has problems doing maths. 
  * Almost half of Irish adults do not have the digital skills to use everyday technology. 

This means that many people find everyday tasks difficult, such as:

  * Filling in forms 
  * Paying bills 
  * Helping children with their homework 
  * Reading the instructions on a medicine bottle 
  * Shopping online 

But, you can improve your reading, writing, maths, and digital skills at any
age.

##  How can I improve my literacy?

People of every age and from every background can have literacy needs. It does
not matter if you have finished school or done exams, you can improve your
skills at any time for any reason.

You can get free adult literacy classes locally, by phone, or online.
