##  What are my rights when travelling by bus or coach?

You have passenger rights when you travel on most buses or coaches in the EU.

These cover delays, cancellations, lost luggage and injury to passengers.

_Travel operators_ must:

  * Give you information about your rights and what help you are entitled to 
  * Treat you and other passengers fairly and equally 
  * Resolve issues caused by delays or cancellations 

Travel operators include transport companies (which run buses) and companies
that operate terminals such as bus stations.

##  Travel services covered

You have certain rights when travelling by bus or coach within the EU. These
EU rules apply to:

  * Journeys that begin and end within the EU 
  * Regular services that run along specified routes with scheduled stopping points 

###  Rules for bus companies

Bus companies running regular bus services of any distance must:

####  Sell tickets without any discrimination

Operators cannot discriminate based on your nationality or where you live. For
example, they must not set different prices for people of different
nationalities.

####  Provide information

Throughout the journey, operators must provide information on your rights and
contact details for the Irish National Transport Authority. If travelling in
another EU country, they must provide details for another national enforcement
body (NEB).

####  Be able to receive complaints

They must provide a complaints system so you can claim your rights.

When travelling on a regular bus service with a scheduled distance of more
than 250km, you must also be given a ticket (paper copy or an e-ticket) or
another document giving you the right to travel.

##  Cancellations, delays and compensation

When travelling on a regular bus service with a scheduled distance of more
than 250km, you have additional rights if your departure is delayed or
cancelled.

You are entitled to:

  * Information 
  * Re-routing or refund 
  * Care and assistance 
  * Compensation and help if there is an accident 

###  Information

The bus company must tell you about the situation within 30 minutes of the
time the bus was due to leave. They should also tell you:

  * The time it is likely to leave 
  * Alternative ways to get to your destination if you will miss a connection 

###  Re-routing or refund

Where the service has been over-booked, cancelled or delayed by more than 2
hours, you have the right to choose:

  * Re-routing to your final destination **or**
  * To get a full refund 

If you were not offered this choice, you have the right to a refund plus
additional compensation of 50% of the ticket price.

###  Care and assistance

If your service was due to last more than 3 hours and is delayed by more than
90 minutes, you have extra entitlements.

The bus company must offer you:

  * Free snacks, meals and refreshments in line with the length of the delay 
  * Accommodation if you have to stay overnight for up to 2 nights (to the maximum value of €80 a night) and transport to and from the accommodation 

###  Compensation and help if there is an accident

You are entitled to compensation for death or personal injury and for luggage
that is lost or damaged due to an accident. You also have the right to
reasonable assistance immediately after an accident. This can include
accommodation, food, clothes, transport and first aid.

##  Support for passengers with disabilities and reduced mobility

If you have a disability or reduced mobility, you have specific rights when
you travel by bus or coach.

You have the right to:

  * Be treated fairly and equally 
  * Be given information about your rights and the accessibility of the service 
  * Get help if you need it 

You also have the following extra rights:

###  Your right to access and a ticket

You have the right to get a ticket, book a seat and use transport services in
the same way as other passengers. You should not be discriminated against or
charged extra.

You can only be refused travel if the service cannot be provided safely. For
example, due to the layout of the bus or coach, the boarding points, or the
type of seats or luggage racks.

In most cases, if the bus company refuses you a ticket or a reservation, or
requires you to bring a helper, they must immediately tell you why. If you ask
for written confirmation, they must send it to you within 5 working days.

###  Your right to assistance

Assistance means extra help because you have a disability or have reduced
mobility. You must tell the bus company what help you will need before you
travel. The bus company should then give the assistance free of charge.

If you will need help at a bus terminal and on board the coach, you must give
at least 36 hours’ notice before you plan to travel.

If you need someone to come with you to help you, they must be allowed to
travel for free. You must inform the bus company, before you travel, about
your specific requirements.

You can get a refund or re-routing if you have a ticket or a reservation, and:

  * You told the bus company about your specific needs 
  * You are not allowed to travel because of your disability or reduced mobility 

###  Your mobility equipment is lost or damaged

If your medical or mobility equipment is lost or damaged (and the bus company
is at fault), you are entitled to compensation. The bus company should do
their best to provide suitable temporary replacement equipment.

Your Europe has more information about [ rights for travellers with reduced
mobility ](https://europa.eu/youreurope/citizens/travel/transport-
disability/reduced-mobility/index_en.htm) .

##  Making a complaint

If you are not satisfied with how a bus company has handled an issue, you
should complain to them directly.

Contact the bus company to find out exactly how to make a complaint to them.

Follow their instructions to make a complaint. You must make your complaint
within 3 months of the incident. You must receive a reply within 1 month,
telling you that the complaint has been accepted or rejected or if it is still
being considered.

###  Taking your complaint further

If you are not satisfied with the response, you can take your complaint to the
[ National Transport Authority (NTA) ](https://www.nationaltransport.ie/) .

If you cannot resolve your complaint or the bus company refuses to pay
compensation, you can consider court action. If your claim for compensation is
€2,000 or less, you use the [ small claims procedure ](/en/justice/courts-
system/small-claims-court/) .

For cross-border disputes within the EU for €5,000 or less, you can use the [
European small claims procedure ](/en/justice/courts-system/european-small-
claims-procedure/) .
