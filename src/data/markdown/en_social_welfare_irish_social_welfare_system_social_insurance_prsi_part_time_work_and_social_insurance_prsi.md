#  Part-time work and social insurance (PRSI)

##  Introduction

Part-time workers over 16 years of age and earning over €38 in each _PRSI
contribution_ week are liable to pay social insurance. It is called [ Pay
Related Social Insurance (PRSI) ](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-
system/social-insurance-prsi/social-insurance/) because the amount of social
insurance you pay depends on your earnings and the type of work you do.

If you are a part-time worker you may not be making the maximum amount of PRSI
contributions each year. The tax year and the PRSI contribution week start 1
January every year. As a result, the **PRSI contribution week** can differ
from the **working week** _._ If you are in part-time work you need to be
fully aware of the possible effect this can have on your social insurance
entitlements.

##  How many PRSI contributions do part-time workers pay?

You pay a PRSI contribution for each PRSI contribution week you work. You must
be **working on at least 1 day in each PRSI contribution week** to pay a
contribution.

If you have a week-on, week-off work pattern, you may not pay a contribution
in the week you are off if it coincides with the PRSI contribution week. This
can happen whether you work a full 5 days every second week (such as Monday to
Friday) or if you work a split week, such as Wednesday to Friday one week,
followed by Monday and Tuesday the next. It all depends on the starting day of
the PRSI contribution week, which is determined by where 1 January falls each
year.

###  **Example: PRSI contribution week runs from Monday**

In a year when 1 January falls on a Monday, then each PRSI contribution week
in that year runs from Monday to the following Sunday. If your work pattern is
week-on, week-off, Monday to Friday, you miss paying PRSI in every second PRSI
contribution week, as you are not working at all during each of those weeks.
In this situation, you would pay only 26 contributions in the year.

Similarly, if your pattern is Monday to Friday for 3 weeks, with 1 week off,
you would pay 39 contributions in the year.

However, if you work Wednesday to Friday in one week, followed by Monday and
Tuesday the next, you will pay the full 52 contributions in the year, as you
will have worked during each Monday-Sunday PRSI contribution week.

###  Situation in 2024

In 2024, 1 January fell on a Monday which means that each PRSI contribution
week runs from Monday to Sunday. For example, if your part-time work
arrangement requires that you work part of every week between the days Monday
to Friday, you will get your full 52 PRSI contributions for 2024.

**2024** : PRSI contribution week runs from Monday to Sunday.

###  Situation in previous years when 1 January fell on different days

In 2023, 1 January fell on a Sunday which meant that each PRSI contribution
week ran from Sunday to Saturday. For example, if your part-time work
arrangement required that you work at least one day every week between the
days Monday to Friday, you will have received your full 52 PRSI contributions
for 2023. For more examples see table below.

In 2022, 1 January fell on a Saturday which meant that each PRSI contribution
week ran from Saturday to Friday. For example, if your part-time work
arrangement required that you work at least one day every week between the
days Monday to Friday, you will have received your full 52 PRSI contributions
for 2021. For more examples see table below.

In 2021, 1 January fell on a Friday which meant that each PRSI contribution
week ran from Friday to Thursday. For example, if your part-time work
arrangement required that you work at least one day every week between the
days Monday to Friday, you will have received your full 52 PRSI contributions
for 2021. For more examples see table below.

##  How much PRSI do part-time workers pay?

To determine the rate of PRSI you and your employer pay, your gross pay is
divided by the number of contribution weeks that is covered by your pattern of
work. More information can be found in our page about [ your liability to pay
PRSI ](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/social-insurance-
prsi/social-insurance/) .

  
If you earn between €38 and €352 you do not have to pay PRSI. However, your
employer pays PRSI. More information can be found in our page about [ your
employer's duty to pay social insurance ](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-
welfare-system/social-insurance-prsi/paying-social-insurance/) .
