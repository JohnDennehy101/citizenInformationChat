#  Extra social welfare benefits

  * Information 

##  Information

If you are getting a social welfare payment from the Department of Social
Protection, you may be entitled to additional or extra benefits depending on
your personal circumstances.

In some cases, you can get a benefit even if you are not getting a social
welfare payment. For example, everyone over 66 is entitled to avail of the
Free Travel Scheme.

To get an extra benefit you must satisfy the qualifying criteria. For example,
to get the Living Alone Increase you must be getting a certain social welfare
payment and be living alone.

In some cases you automatically get an additional benefit. For example, if you
get Invalidity Pension you automatically get free travel. However, for most
additional benefits you must apply separately.

You may be entitled to the following additional social welfare benefits:

children/back-to-school-clothing-and-footwear-allowance/) , and [ Heating
Supplements ](/en/social-welfare/supplementary-welfare-schemes/diet-and-
heating-supplements/) .

[ Free Travel Scheme ](/en/social-welfare/extra-social-welfare-benefits/free-
travel/) allows people on certain social welfare payments to access public
transport services for free. If you live on a specified island off the Irish
