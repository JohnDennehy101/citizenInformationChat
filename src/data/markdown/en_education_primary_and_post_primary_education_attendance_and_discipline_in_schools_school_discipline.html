##  Introduction

Schools must have a code of behaviour for students. It is drawn up by the
board of management with help from parents and staff.

The code of behaviour sets out how students are expected to behave. It also
sets out how students will be disciplined, if they do not follow the code.

If you want to appeal a suspension or expulsion, you must appeal in writing
within 42 days of the decision by the board of management. You can read more
about 'How to appeal a suspension or expulsion from school' below.

##  Code of behaviour for students

When your child starts school, the principal must give you a copy of the
school’s code of behaviour. You may also be asked to agree to make all
reasonable efforts to ensure that your child complies with the code.

The code of behaviour in a school sets out the:

  * Standards of behaviour that the student attending the school must follow 
  * Disciplinary measures that may be taken 
  * Procedures to follow before a student is suspended or expelled 
  * Grounds for lifting a suspension 

Department of Education guidelines recommend that the [ prevention of bullying
](/en/education/primary-and-post-primary-education/attendance-and-discipline-
in-schools/bullying-in-schools-in-ireland/) should be a fundamental part of
the written code of behaviour and discipline in all schools.

Codes are drawn up with input from teachers, parents and the educational
welfare officer. Educational welfare officers work for [ Tusla (the Child and
Family Agency) ](http://www.tusla.ie/services/educational-welfare-services/)
and they help co-ordinate all policies around [ attendance
](/en/education/primary-and-post-primary-education/attendance-and-discipline-
in-schools/school-attendance/) and broader educational welfare.

There are [ Guidelines for Schools on Developing a Code of Behaviour (pdf)
](http://www.tusla.ie/uploads/content/guidelines_school_codes_eng.pdf) and [
information for parents and guardians about schools
](https://www.tusla.ie/tess/information-for-parents-and-guardians-tess/) on
the Tusla website.

##  Discipline in schools

Schools have considerable independence in the area of discipline. However,
they must use fair procedures. This includes hearing the student's case.

It is assumed that parents agree to the punishments set out in the code of
behaviour, if they are told about the code when their child starts school. As
a result, if the punishment is detention, the parents or student cannot claim
that the student has been falsely imprisoned.

The Department provides [ guidelines to primary schools about developing
policy on school discipline
](https://assets.gov.ie/15651/0cfe8a4e2f8a4daf97e0a9f45dc25f70.pdf) and [
guidelines to second-level schools about developing policy on school
discipline ](https://www.gov.ie/en/circular/35916bd98c30416abf63e1a9242f8d4a/)
.

###  Corporal punishment

Under Section 24 of the [ Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act 1997
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1997/en/act/pub/0026/index.html) , corporal
punishment of students may be a crime. However, Sections 18 and 20 of the Act
permit the justifiable use of force in certain circumstances, for example,
self-defence or defence of others.

##  What happens if my child is suspended from school?

If there has been serious misbehaviour, the school’s board of management or
the school principal may decide to suspend your child. The process for
suspension should be set out in the school’s code of behaviour.

The school will notify the parents of the suspension. If your child is
suspended they will keep their place in the school. This means that they can
return to the school at the end of their suspension.

A child should not be suspended for more than 3 days at a time, except in
exceptional circumstances.

If your child is suspended from school for 20 days or more in a school year,
you have the right to appeal this decision to the Department of Education. You
must appeal within 42 days of the decision to suspend your child – see ‘How to
appeal a suspension or expulsion from school’ below.

##  What happens if my child is expelled from school?

Before your child is expelled, the school must tell the educational welfare
officer in writing of its decision. The educational welfare officer may then
try to find a solution. Your child cannot be expelled until 20 days after the
educational welfare officer has been notified about the case.

If your child is expelled they will lose their place at the school.

You can appeal the decision to expel your child from school to the Department
of Education. You must appeal within 42 days of the decision – see ‘How to
appeal a suspension or expulsion’ below.

##  How to appeal a suspension or expulsion from school

If your child is expelled from school or suspended for 20 days or more in a
school year, you have the right to appeal the decision under [ Section 29, of
the Education Act 1998
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1998/act/51/section/29/enacted/en/html) .

**You must appeal in writing within 42 days of the decision by the board of
management.**

The following people can make an appeal:

  * The student’s parent(s) 
  * The student, if they are aged over 18 
  * Tusla may in certain cases appoint an independent person to appeal the suspension or expulsion of a student 

You must complete and return a [ Section 29 Appeal form
](https://assets.gov.ie/97232/45221182-a823-4768-8649-f06a8c2eb2ec.pdf) to the
Section 29 Appeals Administration Unit within 42 days of the date of the
decision by the board of management – see ‘Where to send your appeal’ below.

The Department of Education has information about [ how to appeal an expulsion
or suspension ](https://www.gov.ie/en/service/90de23-appeal-against-permanent-
exclusion-suspension-or-refusal-to-enrol/) .

###  Appeal hearing

You will be asked to attend an appeal hearing. You can bring 2 other people
with you. However, they cannot make a statement at the hearing unless the
appeals committee allows them to do so.

If the student is aged over 18, he or she can attend the hearing.

The hearing is normally held within 21 days of the Department getting your
completed Section 29 appeal form.

At the hearing, your appeal will be heard by an appeals committee of 3 people.
You and the school can present your case and have a right of reply. Members of
the appeal committee may ask you questions.

The appeals committee may invite people with relevant expertise to attend or
make a statement such as Tusla or the [ National Council of Special Education
](https://ncse.ie/) .

The committee is appointed by the Minister of Education, but independent of
the Department. In making its decision, the appeal committee must consider
factors such as the:

  * Nature of the behaviour 
  * Explanation offered 
  * Efforts made by the school to help the student 
  * Educational interests of your child 
  * Effect on other students. 

They will also consider any safety, health and welfare issues for students and
staff.

**Outcome of your appeal**

After the hearing, the appeals committee will write to you and the other
participants with their preliminary decision and the reasons for their
decision.

You and the other participants have an opportunity to respond in writing
within 7 days of the preliminary decision being issued.

The appeals committee will then make its final decision. You will be sent a
copy of the final decision and the reasons for the decision.

###  If your appeal is allowed

If the final decision of the appeal committee is to allow your appeal, your
child will be readmitted to the school.

The suspension or expulsion will be removed from your child’s school record.

###  If your appeal is refused

If the appeal committee agrees with the decision to suspend your child from
school, your child can return to their school at the end of their suspension.

If the appeal committee agrees with the decision to expel your child from
school, your child cannot return to their school. However, [ Tusla’s Education
Support Services (TESS) ](https://www.tusla.ie/tess/) can assist you in
getting a new school placement for your child.

##  Where to send your appeal

You must complete and return a [ Section 29 Appeal form
](https://assets.gov.ie/97232/45221182-a823-4768-8649-f06a8c2eb2ec.pdf) to the
Section 29 Appeals Administration Unit within 42 days of the date of the
decision by the board of management.
