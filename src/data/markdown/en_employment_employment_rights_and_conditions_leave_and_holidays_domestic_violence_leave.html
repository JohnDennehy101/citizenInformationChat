##  What is domestic violence leave?

If you are experiencing domestic violence and abuse, you may need to take time
off work for urgent and essential matters relating to your situation.

This could be for medical visits, legal proceedings, counselling, looking for
alternative accommodation or accessing domestic violence services. It might
not be possible to do these things outside your work hours or you may need to
keep them hidden from your abuser.

From 27 November 2023, you have a legal right to **5 days of paid domestic
violence leave** if you need to take time off work because of the abuse.

You do not need to be working in your job for a certain amount of time to
qualify.

You do not have to give your employer notice to take the leave in emergency
circumstances. However, you should give notice if you are able to.

The domestic violence can be ongoing or have occurred in the past.

The entitlement to domestic violence leave comes from the [ Work Life Balance
and Miscellaneous Provisions Act 2023.
](https://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2023/act/8/enacted/en/html)

##  If you are supporting someone

You can also take this leave if you are supporting a ‘relevant person’ such as
a partner.

If [ you are worried about someone you know ](https://www.womensaid.ie/get-
help/helping-someone-else/) , you can call the Women’s Aid **24 hour National
Freephone Helpline on 1800 341 900** .

The Woman’s Aid website has [ simple steps to provide emotional and practical
support. ](https://www.womensaid.ie/get-help/helping-someone-else/)

##  Types of abuse

Domestic violence and abuse includes violence, or threat of violence,
including emotional, physical, sexual, digital, and economic abuse and
coercive control. Abuse can happen to anyone at any age and in any type of
relationship. You can read more about [ domestic violence and abuse
](/en/birth-family-relationships/problems-in-marriages-and-other-
relationships/domestic-violence-and-abuse/) , [ court protections ](/en/birth-
family-relationships/problems-in-marriages-and-other-relationships/barring-
safety-and-protection-orders/) , and [ organisations and services that can
help you ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/birth-family-
relationships/problems-in-marriages-and-other-relationships/domestic-violence-
and-abuse/#6911f0) .

If you think you, or someone you know, is a victim of domestic abuse you can
get information on [ recognising an abusive relationship
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/birth_family_relationships/problems_in_marriages_and_other_relationships/signs_of_abusive_relationship.html)
and where you can [ get help ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/birth-
family-relationships/problems-in-marriages-and-other-relationships/signs-of-
abusive-relationship/#6911f0) .

##  Who can apply?

All employees who have experienced or are currently experiencing abuse are
entitled to domestic violence leave.

You are eligible if the person perpetrating the domestic violence and abuse is
your:

  * Spouse or civil partner 
  * Cohabitant 
  * Current or former intimate partner (current boyfriend or girlfriend or ex) 
  * Child who is over 18 and not financially dependent on you 

You are also eligible for domestic violence leave if you are supporting a
'relevant person'. A ‘relevant person’ is someone who has experienced or is
experiencing domestic violence or abuse and that person is your:

  * Spouse or civil partner 
  * Cohabitant 
  * Intimate partner 
  * Child who is under 18 
  * Another dependent person 

You do not need to be working in your job for a certain amount of time to
qualify for the leave.

###  How to use the domestic violence leave

The leave can be taken to allow you, or the person you are supporting, to do
any of the following:

  * Get medical help 
  * Access services from a victim services organisation 
  * Access counselling 
  * Relocate temporarily or permanently 
  * Get a safety order from the courts 
  * Get help or advice from a legal practitioner like a solicitor 
  * Get help from the Garda Síochána 
  * Access any other relevant services 

##  How much domestic violence leave is available?

You have a right to 5 days of domestic violence leave in any consecutive 12
months. This is the _statutory entitlement_ (that means the legal minimum).
Your employer can give you more than the statutory entitlement and they may
give you additional paid or unpaid special leave if needed.

If you work part-time, you are entitled to domestic violence leave on a _pro-
rata basis_ . This means, for example, if you work 50% of a normal working
week, you are entitled to 2.5 days’ leave.

The leave does not need to be taken all at once. It can be taken as single or
multiple days. An absence for part of a day is counted as one day.

##  Will my pay be affected?

Domestic violence leave is paid by your employer at your full rate of pay.

You must be paid at your **normal daily rate of pay** . Your employer should
not make any reference to domestic violence leave on your payslip.

###  **What is normal daily pay?**

Your normal daily pay includes any regular bonus or allowance which does not
change from week to week (but excludes overtime or commission).

If your **pay changes from week to week** , your pay for domestic violence
leave is the average of your pay over the 13 weeks before you are on leave.
This could be, for example, because of regular bonus payments or allowances.

##  How to apply

Check if your employer has a workplace domestic violence policy and follow the
process to apply for the leave and other supports available.

###  Do I need to give notice to my employer?

You do not have to give your employer notice to take domestic violence leave
in emergency circumstances.

You should give notice if you are able to, or as soon as you practically can
after taking it.

###  Disclosing your experience to your employer

Getting support from your employer means you need to disclose your experience
to someone at work. In most jobs, employees usually tell their direct manager
about absences.

Or, your employer may assign a specific or _designated_ person to handle
matters related to domestic violence leave and other available support. The
designated person could be a HR manager or the business owner.

Your employer should make sure the designated person is well-trained to handle
employee disclosures properly.

###  Can my employer ask for proof?

You are not required to give your employer any supporting information or
evidence when requesting domestic violence leave.

There might be exceptional situations where your employer could ask for
supporting documents, but this would be rare and is not in line with the
intentions of the law.

##  Confidentiality

Your employer should treat any information you disclose about domestic
violence with the utmost sensitivity and confidentiality.

They should only share the information with those who need it for safety plans
or administering domestic violence leave. Ideally, your employer should get
your written permission before sharing any information.

Sharing information does not always mean breaking confidentiality. Your
employer can find ways to share details without revealing your identity or the
fact that you disclosed domestic violence.

##  Your employment rights

In general, you will be treated as if you are in work during domestic violence
leave.

This means:

  * Your time on domestic violence leave does not break your continuous service. It also counts as service when calculating entitlements such as annual leave and public holidays. 
  * You must not be dismissed for taking or asking to take domestic violence leave. 
  * You must not be [ victimised ](/en/employment/enforcement-and-redress/victimisation-at-work/) for taking or asking to take domestic violence leave. Your employer cannot penalise or treat you unfairly by, for example, giving you worse conditions of employment or selecting you for redundancy. 

##  Enforcing your rights

If you have a complaint or dispute with your employer over domestic violence
leave, you should raise it with your employer first.

If you cannot resolve the issue directly with your employer, you can [ make a
formal complaint to the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC)
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/employment/enforcement-and-
redress/adjudication-employment-rights-disputes-and-complaints/#e4bfaf) .

##  Other supports at work

After you tell your employer about the situation, your employer may discuss
other ways to ensure your safety at work.

Possible ways to keep you safe include changes to work duties, location,
contact details and other enhanced security measures. Any workplace safety
plan is confidential and shared on a need-to know basis.

If there is a serious threat to your life or health, your employer may take
action to refer you to a specialist organisation such as [ Safe Ireland
](https://www.safeireland.ie/get-help/where-to-find-help/) . Your employer
should talk to you first before deciding whether a situation is a serious
threat.

You or your employer can refer to the DV at Work [ detailed guidance note
](https://dvatwork.ie/) for different support options available. It covers:

  * Travelling to and from work 
  * Safety on and off site 
  * Working from home 
  * Workplace communication 
  * Flexible working arrangements 
  * Financial needs 
  * Performance and behaviour 
  * Employee absence 
  * Perpetrator presence or contact 
  * Specialist support 
  * Sharing information

get support.**
