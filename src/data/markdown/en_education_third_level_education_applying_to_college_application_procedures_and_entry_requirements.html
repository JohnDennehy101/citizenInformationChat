  * CAO application fees 
  * How to apply to college 
  * CAO contact details 

##  Applying to college in Ireland

You apply for almost all full-time [ third-level education
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/education/third-level-
education/colleges-and-qualifications/third-level-education-in-ireland/)
undergraduate courses through the Central Applications Office (CAO).

Undergraduate courses available in universities and institutes of technology
include:

  * Higher Certificates (Level 6) 
  * Ordinary Bachelor degrees (Level 7) 
  * Honours Bachelor degrees (Level 8) 

You can find a list of the courses on offer and information on how to apply in
the [ CAO handbook ](https://www.cao.ie/handbook.php) .

You can apply to study in third-level institutions through the [ CAO portal
](https://www.cao.ie/apply.php) .

###  **Courses outside of the CAO**

The [ tertiary education programme
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/education/third-level-
education/applying-to-college/tertiary-education-programme/) is a new pathway
to get a degree. You don’t need to apply through the CAO. Read how to apply on
the [ National Tertiary Office (NTO) website ](https://nto.hea.ie/courses/) .

You can apply for [ Post-Leaving Certificate (PLC) courses
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/education/further-education-and-
training/post-leaving-certificate-courses/) directly to the individual
colleges. You don’t apply through the CAO.

##  Key dates for CAO applications

###  **CAO applications for 2024-2025**

CAO applications for 2024-2025 opened on 6 November 2023 and closed on 1
February 2024 (see ‘Table of key dates for CAO applications 2024-2025’ below).

###  Late applications

Late applications for CAO 2024-2025 closed on 1 May 2024.

You will not be considered for [ HEAR
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/education/third-level-
education/applying-to-college/third-level-admissions-scheme-for-students-from-
disadvantaged-backgrounds/) or [ DARE
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/education/third-level-
education/applying-to-college/third-level-admissions-scheme-for-students-with-
disabilities/) , or assessed as a mature student, if you made a late
application.

####  **Restricted-application courses**

Some courses are ‘restricted-application’ courses.

These courses have early assessment procedures, sometimes as early as
February. If you want to apply for such a course, you must include it in your
CAO application in time, so that the relevant higher education institution
(HEI) can arrange the early assessment.

This means you can’t make a late application. See the CAO’s [ calendar of
restricted-application tests and interviews
](http://www.cao.ie/index.php?page=testandinterviews) .

###  Changing your mind

You can change your course choices online, free of charge, from 7 May 2024
until 5pm on 1 July 2024.

###  Courses in medicine

For courses in medicine, you must take the Health Professions Admissions Test
(HPAT). You can find information and important dates [ on the HPAT-Ireland
website. ](https://hpat-ireland.acer.edu.au/about-hpat-ireland)

You can also read about [ graduate entry programmes in medicine in 2024

##  College entry requirements

###  Leaving Cert points

Students who have taken the [ Leaving Certificate examination
](/en/education/state-examinations/leaving-certificate/) get points for the
results they get in their 6 best subjects at a single sitting of the Leaving
Certificate.

The points awarded depend on the level of achievement in the subject. You can
use the [ points calculator ](https://www.qualifax.ie/points-calculator) on
qualifax.ie to work out what points you get for any set of results.

The [ State Certificate ](/en/education/state-examinations/leaving-cert-
accredited-grades/) offered to students for Leaving Certificate 2021 has the
same status as the Leaving Certificates awarded to students in previous years.

The number of entry-level points you need for a course depends on:

  * The number of places available, and 
  * The number of applicants for those places. 

The entry level varies from year to year. You get higher points for Higher-
Level exam papers than for Ordinary-Level papers.

Some universities may allocate [ extra bonus points for Higher-Level
mathematics ](https://www.cao.ie/index.php?page=scoring&s=lcepointsgrid) .

The CAO publishes the [ minimum points required for admission to courses
](http://www.cao.ie/index.php?page=points) as each round of offers is made.
You can also check the points required in previous years.

####  **Disability Access Route to Education**

If you meet certain criteria, you may qualify for the Disability Access Route
to Education (DARE) scheme, which aims to improve access to [ higher education
for school-leavers with disabilities ](/en/education/third-level-
education/applying-to-college/third-level-admissions-scheme-for-students-with-
disabilities/) .

####  **Higher Education Access Route**

If you meet certain criteria, you may qualify for the [ Higher Education
Access Route (HEAR) ](/en/education/third-level-education/applying-to-
college/third-level-admissions-scheme-for-students-from-disadvantaged-
backgrounds/) admissions scheme. This scheme allocates a number of third-level
places on a reduced points basis to school-leavers from socially disadvantaged
backgrounds.

###  Specific academic entry requirements

A student must also have the particular academic entry requirements (also
called 'matriculation requirements') for the course they want to take.

You can get detailed information about the academic entry requirements from
each university, college, or institute.
