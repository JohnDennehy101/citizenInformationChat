##  Introduction

Judicial review is a way for the High Court to supervise the lower courts, [
tribunals ](/en/government-in-ireland/how-government-works/tribunals-and-
investigations/tribunals-introduction/) and other administrative bodies to
ensure that they make their decisions properly and in accordance with the law.
The [ High Court ](/en/justice/courts-system/high-court/) has the power or
_jurisdiction_ called "judicial review".

Judicial review is primarily concerned with the decision-making process rather
than with the substance of the decision. There is, however, a limited scope
for review of the substance of a decision as well.

To apply for judicial review, you must show that you were affected in some way
by the decision you are challenging. You must also show that your case has
grounds.

There are 2 types of judicial review:

  * **Conventional judicial review** : Procedure governing conventional judicial review is set out in [ Order 84 of the Rules of the Superior Courts ](http://www.courts.ie/rules.nsf/8652fb610b0b37a980256db700399507/a53b0f76ffc6c5b780256d2b0046b3dc?OpenDocument) . 
  * **Statutory judicial review** : Some legislation sets out rules about how statutory reviews of decisions made under the legislation should be governed. Statutory schemes apply to such areas as asylum, pollution control, planning and the takeover of companies. 

##  Types of decisions covered by judicial review

Decisions made by administrative bodies and the lower courts may be judicially
reviewed by the High Court. In a judicial review, generally the court is not
concerned with the merits of the decision but rather with the lawfulness of
the decision-making process. This includes reviewing how the decision was made
and the fairness of it.

Judicial review of a decision of the lower courts is generally not the same as
appealing the decision. An appeal against a decision of a lower court is often
based on the substance of the decision, rather than just how the decision was
made. However, in many cases where a judicial review is available, there also
may be the option of appeal.

Some examples of judicially reviewable decisions include:

  * Decisions of the District and Circuit Courts 
  * [ Inquest ](/en/death/sudden-or-unexplained-death/inquests-and-inquest-reports/) verdicts 
  * Decisions of tribunals (for example, the Labour Court, the Residential Tenancies Board, and the International Protection Appeals Board) 
  * Discharge of a member of the defence forces or An Garda Síochána 
  * Decisions of the [ Social Welfare Appeals Office ](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/social-welfare-appeals/)
  * Refusals of an Irish passport, marriage certificate, or visa 
  * Deportation orders 
  * Decisions of [ An Bord Pleanála ](http://www.pleanala.ie) relating to planning permission 
  * Decisions of Government bodies that require an Environmental Impact Assessment and/or an Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control (IPPC) licence. 
  * Decisions of the [ Legal Aid Board ](http://www.legalaidboard.ie) and the [ Law Society ](http://www.lawsociety.ie) . 
  * Decisions of a public administrative body relating to the environment. 

##  Basic principles of public decision-making

There are some basic principles that public bodies must follow for their
decisions to be deemed fair. The decision maker must comply with all legal
requirements governing the decision and its making.

###  Authority to make the decision

The decision-maker must have authority to make the decision that affects you.
If the decision-maker has the authority to make the decision, it must not go
beyond the limits of its authority. Going beyond its limits is called acting
_ultra vires_ .

###  The right to be heard and impartiality

You are entitled to fair procedures in how the decision is reached. This means
that the decision-maker must not be biased and the decision-maker must give
you a fair hearing. You must be given an adequate opportunity to present your
case. You must be informed of the matter and you must be given a chance to
comment on the material put forward by the other side.

##  What can the High Court order?

If the decision-maker does not have authority or does not give you fair
procedure, you may bring judicial review proceedings in the High Court to
challenge the decision. The High Court can grant reliefs and remedies in any
of the following ways:

###  Order of Certiorari

The High Court can cancel the original decision by granting an Order of
Certiorari. The original decision maker generally must then re-examine the
case and issue a new decision.

###  Order of Mandamus

If the adjudicating body has yet to issue a decision, the High Court can
compel them to make a decision by issuing an Order of Mandamus.

###  Order of Prohibition

The High Court can prevent the adjudicating body from issuing a decision by
issuing an Order of Prohibition. For instance, the High Court may prohibit a
criminal trial from going ahead in the Circuit Court.

###  Declaration

The Court may issue a declaration of the rights of the parties.

###  Injunction

An injunction can either prevent an action or compel an action.

###  Damages

The Court can award damages if it believes that this is a suitable remedy.

##  Judicial review procedure

The conventional judicial review procedure is governed by [ Order 84 of the
Rules of the Superior Courts
](http://www.courts.ie/rules.nsf/8652fb610b0b37a980256db700399507/a53b0f76ffc6c5b780256d2b0046b3dc?OpenDocument)
.

###  Leave stage

The first step is to make an application for leave to bring judicial review
proceedings. The leave stage is used to identify and filter out, at an early
stage, claims which may be trivial or without merit. At the leave stage you
must show that you have "sufficient interest" in the matter. In other words,
you must demonstrate that you are affected in some way by the decision you are
challenging.

The application to the court is based on a statement of grounds. This
statement should set out the reasons a judicial review is sought. It should be
accompanied by an affidavit.

If leave to proceed is granted, the applicant may then bring judicial review
proceedings. A notice of motion should be prepared and, along with the court
order granting leave to proceed with the judicial review and both the
statement of grounds and the affidavit prepared for the earlier stage, served
on all persons directly affected by the application.

###  Statement of Opposition

A respondent who wishes to oppose an application for judicial review is
required to file a Statement of Opposition, and may file a replying affidavit
contesting the facts set out by the applicant. Once the pleadings have closed,
the matter proceeds to a hearing.

###  Notice parties

Any person who may be affected by the judicial review proceedings and judgment
should be notified or may apply to be heard as a notice party. For example
where a person challenges a planning permission granted by An Bord Pleanála
(the respondent) the applicant for the planning permission would also be
entitled to be heard in the proceedings as a notice party as the proceedings
will have an impact on their planning application.

###  Time limits

Order 84, Rule 21 (1) of the Rules of the Superior Courts provides that an
application for leave to apply for judicial review shall be made within 3
months from the date when grounds for the application first arose.

Where the relief sought is an order of certiorari in respect of any judgement,
order, conviction or other proceeding, the date when grounds for the
application first arose is the date of that judgement, order, conviction or
proceeding.

However Order 84, Rule 21 (3) provides for an extension of time for an
application for judicial review but the court shall only extend such period if
it is satisfied that:

  * There is good and sufficient reason for doing so, **and**
  * The circumstances that resulted in the failure to make the application for leave within the three month time period either: 

(i) Were outside the control of, or

(ii) Could not reasonably have been anticipated by the applicant for such
extension.

The court may have regard to the effect that an extension of the period may
have on a respondent or third party.

An application for an extension shall be grounded upon an affidavit sworn by
or on behalf of the applicant which shall set out the reasons for the
applicant’s failure to make the application for leave within the three month
period and shall verify any facts relied on in support of those reasons.

###  Statutory schemes

Statutory judicial review schemes supplement Order 84 of the Rules of the
Superior Courts with their own specific procedural rules. These statutory
schemes narrow the availability of review through such features as:

  * Time limits for an application for leave are shorter 
  * Requirements to notify the decision-maker of the leave application 
  * Higher thresholds applied by the High Court when considering whether to allow leave, for example, substantial grounds rather than arguable case. 

Examples of statutory schemes are available in our document: [ Judicial review
in planning and environmental matters ](/en/environment/environment-and-the-
law/judicial-review-in-planning-and-environmental-matters/) .

##  Further information and costs

If you wish to begin judicial review proceedings, you should contact a [
solicitor ](/en/justice/courtroom/solicitors/) who will in turn brief a
barrister to draft the papers for the case. It is also possible for you to
represent yourself if you wish to keep your legal costs down.

###  Costs

There is no fixed rate of charges for legal fees so you should get some quotes
before deciding on legal representation. Your solicitor must advise you in
writing of their fees. If it is not possible to give you a definite sum, they
must estimate a sum or give you information about how charges or fees will be
calculated.

Information on costs in judicial review cases on decisions concerning certain
environmental matters is available in our document: [ Judicial review in
planning and environmental matters ](/en/environment/environment-and-the-
law/judicial-review-in-planning-and-environmental-matters/) . See courts.ie
for [ information on the court fees payable ](https://www.courts.ie/judicial-
review) .
