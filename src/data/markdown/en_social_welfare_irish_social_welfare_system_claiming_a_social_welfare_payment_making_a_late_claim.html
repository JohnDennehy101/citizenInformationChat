##  Time limit to apply for a social welfare payment

To get a social welfare payment, you must apply to the Department of Social
Protection (DSP) for that payment. In general, you must complete an
application form (claim form) within a certain time limit.

The time limit to apply varies, depending on which payment you’re applying
for. In general, the time limits are quite short for short-term payments and
are longer for long-term pensions.

The DSP considers the day it get your application as the day you applied.

###  **Examples of time limits to apply for a payment**

In the case of Jobseeker’s Benefit, you must apply on the day you become
eligible.

But in the case of Illness Benefit, you can apply within 6 weeks of becoming
ill.

###  **When to apply for a payment**

You should apply for a payment as soon as you think you might be entitled to
it. See [ a table showing the timeframe to apply for various payments
](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/723465-operational-guidelines-claims-and-
late-claims/#claiming-within-the-prescribed-
time:~:text=entitled%20to%20it.-,Table%20showing%20the%20prescribed%20time%20for%20making%20a%20claim%20and%20the%20late%20claim%20disqualification%20for%20each%20scheme%3A,-\(Article%20182%20of)
on Gov.ie.

If you apply late, you may get a payment from the date you sent your
application to the DSP.

You may not get your payment backdated to the **time you were entitled to it
but did not apply** .

##  What if I’m late to apply for a payment?

If you are late to apply for a payment, you may get it backdated. Depending on
the payment you are applying for and the reason for your late claim, you may
get your payment backdated to:

  * The time you became entitled to it, or 
  * At least 6 months before you applied. 

###  **Automatic backdating of payments**

The following payments can be backdated by up to 6 or 12 months, without you
needing a reason for applying late:

  * [ State Pension (Contributory) ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/older-and-retired-people/state-pension-contributory/) (6 months) 
  * [ Invalidity Pension ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/disability-and-illness/invalidity-pension/) (6 months) 
  * [ Widow’s, Widower’s, or Surviving Civil Partner’s (Contributory) Pension ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/death-related-benefits/widowed-persons-contrib-pension/) (6 months) 
  * [ Guardian’s Payment (Contributory) ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/death-related-benefits/guardian-and-orphan-payments/) (6 months) 
  * [ Medical Care ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/disability-and-illness/medical-care-scheme/) (12 months) 

The [ Household Benefits Package
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/extra-social-welfare-
benefits/household-benefits-package/) can be [ backdated in some cases.
](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/3bacea-operational-guidelines-household-
benefits-package/#appendices)

Further backdating beyond the set time will be allowed only if:

  * The reason you didn’t apply resulted from incorrect information being supplied by the Department of Social Protection, or 
  * The delay was due to your incapacity. 

###  **Backdating your claim with good reason**

If your payment is not automatically backdated, you must give the DSP a 'good
reason' why you didn't apply [ within the normal time limit
](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/723465-operational-guidelines-claims-and-
late-claims/#claiming-within-the-prescribed-
time:~:text=Table%20showing%20the%20prescribed%20time%20for,12%20months%20before%20date%20of%20claim)
. There is little information about what is a good reason, but if you were
sick or in hospital this might be considered as a good reason for not making
your claim on time.

Generally, the fact that you did not know that you were entitled to a payment
is not considered to be a good reason for not making your claim on time.

The following social welfare schemes can be backdated if you have a good
reason for applying late:

  * [ Adoptive Benefit ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/families-and-children/adoptive-benefit/)

##  How to make a late application

When applying for your social welfare payment, you must state why your
application is late. For some payments, the application form lets you explain
why the application is late (for example, Illness Benefit).

For other payments, you should send an accompanying letter and supporting
evidence with your claim form.

##  Where to send your application form

You should send your claim form (application form), with details about why
your application is late, to the section in the Department of Social
Protection responsible for that payment. The address will be on the bottom of
your claim form.

You can also find information about how to apply for specific payments on [
citizensinformation.ie ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/) . For
example, for information on how to apply for ‘Illness Benefit’, search for
‘Illness Benefit’ on our homepage.

##  How to appeal a decision

If you apply late for a social welfare payment and you are unhappy with the
decision, you can appeal to the Social Welfare Appeals Office (SWAO).
