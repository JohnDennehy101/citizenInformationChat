##  What is Injury Benefit?

Injury Benefit is one of the benefits you can get under the [ Occupational
Injuries Benefit Scheme ](/en/social-welfare/disability-and-
illness/occupational-injuries-benefit-overview/) . It is a weekly payment. You
can get it if you are unfit for work due to:

  * An accident at work 
  * An accident while travelling directly to or from work (on an unbroken journey) 
  * An occupational disease. This is a disease you get from the work that you do. The Department Social Protection (DSP) has a [ list of Prescribed Occupational Diseases ](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/dfb66f-operational-guidelines-injury-benefit/#prescribed-diseases) . 

To get Injury Benefit, you must be unfit for work for more than 3 days as a
result of the accident or disease. The 3 days do not include Sundays and paid
holiday leave.

If you are unfit for work for 3 days or less, you can get a declaration that
you had an occupational accident. It is important to get this declaration in
case your injury or disease causes illness or disability at a later date. It
safeguards your future rights to benefits under the Occupational Injuries
Benefit Scheme.

[ Injury Benefit is taxable ](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-
system/claiming-a-social-welfare-payment/taxation-of-social-welfare-payments/)
but you are unlikely to pay tax if it is your only income.

##  Statutory Sick Pay and Injury Benefit

From 1 Jan 2024, [ Statutory Sick Pay (SSP) ](/en/employment/employment-
rights-and-conditions/leave-and-holidays/sick-leave-and-sick-pay/) increased
from 3 to 5 days a year. You cannot get Injury Benefit on the days that you
get SSP.

If you are unfit for work for 3 days or less, you can still register an Injury
Benefit claim to create a record of the occupational accident (see ‘Number of
days ill or incapacitated’ below).

If your injury or illness lasts more than 5 days, your Injury Benefit starts
from day 6.

If you use your 5 days of SSP in 2024 and you become ill again in the same
year, you'll get Injury Benefit from day 4 of your illness (after the normal 3
waiting days).

See [ examples of how SSP affects Injury Benefit
](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/8c924-illness-benefit-and-statutory-sick-
leave-in-2024/#examples) on gov.ie.

##  How to qualify for Injury Benefit

###  Social insurance (PRSI) contributions

To get Injury Benefit, you must be in employment [ insurable at PRSI Class A,
D, J or M ](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/social-insurance-
prsi/social-insurance-classes/) . At class M, only employees aged under 16 are
covered.

You do not need a certain number of PRSI contributions to qualify for Injury
Benefit.

You will qualify if you are unfit for work because of an occupational disease
or an accident at work or an accident while travelling to or from work.

Civil servants who started work before April 1995 and are insured at Class B
do not qualify for Injury Benefit. But you can get a declaration that an
occupational accident occurred and you may qualify for other benefits under
the Occupational Injuries Benefits Scheme.

###  Number of days ill or incapacitated

Your illness or incapacity must last for more than 3 days (not counting
Sundays and paid holiday leave).

####  If you are unfit for work for 3 days or less

If you are unfit for work for 3 days or less, and you would otherwise qualify
for Injury Benefit, you can still register a claim for Injury Benefit (see
‘How to apply for Injury Benefit’ below).

This creates a record of the workplace-related injury, which you can use to
benefit under the [ Occupational Injuries Benefit Scheme ](/en/social-
welfare/disability-and-illness/occupational-injuries-benefit-overview/) , if
illness or disablement develops at a later date.

###  Work and training

While you are on Injury Benefit, to [ help you to rehabilitate or recover
](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/dfb66f-operational-guidelines-injury-
benefit/#rules-to-be-observed-and-conditions-for-permission-to-work) you can
do:

  * Light work that you are not paid for (and that is not normally paid, such as voluntary work) 
  * Work that is part of your treatment while you are in hospital (or a similar place) where you earn under €50 a week 
  * Work for a charity where you earn under €50 a week 

###  Partial Capacity Benefit

If you want to go back to work and you have transferred from Injury Benefit to
Illness Benefit, you can apply for [ Partial Capacity Benefit
](/en/social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/disability_and_illness/partial_capacity_benefit.html)
.

##  How long is Injury Benefit paid?

Injury Benefit is not paid for the first 3 days of your illness or incapacity
(when you are unfit to work).

You can get Injury Benefit for up to 26 weeks (6 months).

If you are still unable to work after 26 weeks, you may get [ Illness Benefit
](/en/social-welfare/disability-and-illness/illness-benefit/) , [ Disability
Allowance ](/en/social-welfare/disability-and-illness/disability-allowance/)
or [ Supplementary Welfare Allowance ](/en/social-welfare/supplementary-
welfare-schemes/supplementary-welfare-allow/) .

If you lose physical or mental ability as a result of the accident or disease,
you may also get [ Disablement Benefit ](/en/social-welfare/disability-and-
illness/disablement-benefit/) . If you are getting Disablement Benefit and do
not qualify for Illness Benefit or another social welfare payment, you may be
able to get Incapacity Supplement.

If you are getting a [ Working Family Payment (WFP) ](/en/social-
welfare/families-and-children/working-family-payment/) and cannot work because
of an occupational illness or disease, you can continue to get WFP with your
Injury Benefit for up to 36 days (6 weeks).

If you are getting [ Back to Work Family Dividend (BTWFD) ](/en/social-
welfare/families-and-children/back-to-work-family-dividend/) , you can
continue to get BTWFD with your Injury Benefit for 36 days (6 weeks).

##  Rate of Injury Benefit

**Weekly** **Injury Benefit rate in 2024**

**Maximum personal rate** |  **Increase for an adult dependant** |  **Increase for a child dependant**  
---|---|---  
€232  |  €154  |  Child aged under 12  €46 (full rate), €23 (half rate)  Child aged 12 and over  €54 (full rate), €27 (half rate)   
  
You may get an increase in your payment for an [ adult dependant ](/en/social-
welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/claiming-a-social-welfare-
payment/claiming-an-increase-in-your-social-welfare-payment-for-an-adult-
dependant/) and [ dependent children ](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-
welfare-system/claiming-a-social-welfare-payment/claiming-and-increase-in-
your-payment-for-a-child-dependant/) .

##  How to apply for Injury Benefit

You should apply for Injury Benefit within 6 weeks of becoming unfit for work.
If you apply after 6 weeks, you may not get the payment.

To apply, you need to get:

  1. An Injury Benefit claim form (IB1) from your doctor 
  2. A medical certificate (Certificate of Incapacity for Work) from your doctor 

If your doctor submits your medical certificate online, you will get a receipt
for your records. If your doctor cannot complete the medical certificate
online, they will give you a paper copy.

A medical certificate must be sent every week for as long as you are unfit to
work.

You can send your completed form (and medical certificate if not submitted
online) by Freepost to the Injury Benefit Section – see ‘Where to apply’
below.

####  Closing your claim

Your doctor should mark your last medical certificate as ‘final’ before you go
back to work. If they don’t, you should tell the Injury Benefit section by
email at [ ClosemyIBclaim@welfare.ie ](mailto:ClosemyIBclaim@welfare.ie) , or
by phone (see ‘Where to apply’ below).
