##  What is a Public Services Card?

A Public Services Card proves your identity to help you access a range of
public services such as getting social welfare payments.

A Public Services Card is usually issued when you are allocated a [ PPS number
](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/personal-public-service-
number/) . If you apply for, or are getting a social welfare payment
(including Child Benefit), you will be asked to register for your Public
Services Card.

###  What information does a Public Services Card display?

The front of the card has your name, photograph and signature, and the card
expiry date. The back of the card has your PPS number and a card number. It
also holds a magnetic stripe to enable social welfare payments such as
pensions to be collected at post offices.

If you are entitled to [ free travel ](/en/social-welfare/extra-social-
welfare-benefits/free-travel/) , the card will also display this information
in the top left-hand corner.

  * If **FT-P** is written on the card, the holder is entitled to free travel. 
  * If **FT+S** is written on the card, the holder can travel with their spouse, partner or cohabitant for free. 
  * If **FT+C** is written on the card, the holder can have a companion (aged over 16) travel with them for free. 

##  Using your PSC to apply for social welfare payments online

If you have a Public Services Card, you can set up a MyGovID **verified
account** to access a range of [ public services online
](https://www.mygovid.ie/) .

Your mobile phone number must be verified by the Department of Social
Protection (DSP) to set up a MyGovID **verified** **account** .

If you have a Public Services Card and want to get your mobile phone number
verified by the DSP, you can call 0818 927 999.

##  Registering for a Public Services Card

You can register for a Public Services Card:

  * Using the [ MyGovID app ](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/f61b1-mygovid-app/)
  * In-person at a [ Public Services Card (PSC) Centre ](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/be29c7-psc-online-registration-centres/)

The MyGovID app allows you to verify your identity using your smartphone.

IE) app on your smartphone, if you:

  * Are resident in Ireland 
  * Hold a current Irish passport 
  * Are aged 16 years and over 
  * Have a [ basic MyGovID ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/government-in-ireland/how-government-works/egovernment/mygovid/#dcd9ee) account 
  * Have not already completed the SAFE Registration process 

Once your online application has been approved, you will get:

  * A Public Services Card (PSC) in the post 
  * A [ verified MyGovID ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/government-in-ireland/how-government-works/egovernment/mygovid/#3de5eb) account 

If the DSP is unable to process your online application, you will be notified
of what information you need to bring with you to complete the SAFE
registration process at a [ PSC Centre
](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/be29c7-psc-online-registration-centres/) .

##  What is SAFE and SAFE registration?

SAFE stands for Standard Authentication Framework Environment. SAFE
registration is the process the Department of Social Protection uses to check
and confirm a personâ€™s identity. Once your identity has been verified, you can
be issued with a Public Services Card (PSC).

Contact your local [ PSC/SAFE Registration Centre
](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/be29c7-psc-online-registration-centres/)
to make an appointment to get registered. Your local registration centre is
usually your [ local Intreo Centre
](https://www.gov.ie/en/directory/category/e1f4b5-intreo-offices/) . Some [
PSC Centres ](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/be29c7-psc-online-
registration-centres/) have a walk-in service and no appointment is necessary.
Check before you go.

###  How long does SAFE registration take?

SAFE registration takes about 15 minutes to complete. It is important that you
attend for your appointment. It will help to avoid any potential difficulty
with access to social welfare payments in the future. During this appointment
your photograph will be taken and your signature recorded for your new Public
Services Card, which will be posted to your home address. You will also be
asked to provide answers to some security questions.

You must bring certain documents to your appointment to prove your identity
and address. You should also bring the letter confirming your appointment and,
if you have one, your mobile phone. Having your mobile phone with you means
that your number can be verified by the Department. You will need phone
verification to access [ public services online ](https://www.mygovid.ie/) .
If you currently have a Social Services Card (a swipe card used to collect
social welfare payments), bring that with you too.

You must prove your identify to receive a social welfare payment or benefit.
If you comply with the SAFE registration process when requested, you are
considered to have authenticated your identity. If you do not comply with the
SAFE registration process, your social welfare payments (including Child
Benefit) and/or your social welfare entitlements (such as Free Travel) may be
suspended.

###  Documents to bring to your SAFE registration appointment

####  1\. Evidence of identity:
