#  Breaks and respite care for carers

  * What is respite care? 
  * Where will the respite care be provided? 
  * Respite care for children with disabilities 
  * How to apply for respite care 
  * Further supports for carers 

##  What is respite care?

If you are a carer you may need to take breaks. Respite care is when you can
take a break from caring, and the person you care for is looked after by
someone else. It can be covered by family members or an organisation so you
can take a short break, a holiday or a rest. Respite care can be for carers of
older people or people with different disabilities.

Respite care can cover different lengths of time such as:

  * A very short time, for example for an evening 
  * Or a much longer arrangement, for example for a holiday 

Respite care schemes are sometimes called 'Breakaway' or 'Friendship' schemes.

##  Where will the respite care be provided?

The person you care for will get respite care or temporary care in the
community or in an institution. The availability of respite care depends on
where you are located in the country –the respite care can be organised by
your local [ Health Service Executive (HSE)
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/health/health-system/health-service-
executive/) area or by local or national voluntary organisations.

Respite care for older people may be in nursing homes or other institutional
organisations.

##  Respite care for children with disabilities

Children with disabilities may be cared for in different ways during respite
care, including:

  * With a family 
  * One-to-one care with a carer 
  * Overnights at residential facilities 
  * At summer camps (this is included in the cost covered by the HSE) 

Read more about [ caring for a child with a disability.
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/health/health-services/children-s-
health/caring-for-a-child-with-a-disability/)

##  How to apply for respite care

Respite care is organised through your [ public health nurse
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/health/health-services/care-in-your-
community/public-health-nurses/) or family doctor (GP).

Contact [ your local HSE Health office
](https://www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/1/lho/) or Public Health Nurse to
arrange an assessment of the health needs of the person you care for.

You can also go to a voluntary organisation for information on the respite
care they provide.

##  Further supports for carers

You can apply for the [ Carer's Support Grant
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/social-welfare-
payments/carers/carers-support-grant/) (formerly called the Respite Care
Grant). This is a payment, you can get every year from the Department of
Social Protection.

The Carer’s Support grant is paid automatically to carers getting [ Carer's
Allowance ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/social-
welfare-payments/carers/carers-allowance/) , [ Carer's Benefit
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/social-welfare-
payments/carers/carers-benefit/) , or [ Domiciliary Care Allowance
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/social-welfare-
payments/disability-and-illness/domiciliary-care-allowance/) . If you are not
getting one of these payments, you can still qualify for the Carer’s Support
Grant.

Only one Carer’s Support Grant can be paid for each person getting care.

Family Carers Ireland has a network of carer groups across the country. You
can find your local [ Family Carers Ireland - Network of Carer Group
](http://www.familycarers.ie/help-and-advice/carer-groups/)

Care Alliance Ireland runs the [ Online Family Carer Support Group
](https://www.facebook.com/groups/FamilyCarerOnlineSupportGroupIreland/) on
Facebook offering support to carers across Ireland. You can find out more on
the [ Care Alliance website
](https://www.carealliance.ie/OnlineFamilyCarerSupportGroup) .
