##  What is Work and Access?

The new [ Work and Access ](https://www.gov.ie/en/service/47db8-work-and-
access-supports/?referrer=https://www.gov.ie/workandaccess/) employment
programme offers various supports to help people with disabilities find or
keep a job.

The programme aims to remove or reduce workplace barriers and help employers
provide reasonable steps to accommodate the needs of employees and job
applicants with disabilities (known as _reasonable accommodation_ ).

###  **Programme background**

The Work and Access Programme replaces the Department of Social Protection’s
Reasonable Accommodation Fund and the Disability Awareness Support Scheme.

##  Who can apply?

An employee, employer or a self-employed person can apply for Work and Access
supports. The eligibility criteria are set out below.

###  **Individuals**

To qualify, you must:

  * Be over 18 and within the legal working age 
  * Have the right to work in Ireland 
  * Be working or looking for work in the Republic of Ireland, excluding work in the public sector 
  * Have a disability or health condition expected to last longer than 12 months, with professional evidence or qualifying for long-term disability payments 

###  **Work status**

You must be either:

  * Working full-time or part-time (at least 8 hours a week or 32 hours a month) 
  * Self-employed 
  * On work experience, internship, or apprenticeship (at least 6 months) 
  * Holding a job offer or interview confirmation 

###  **Employers or self-employed people**

####  **Employers**

private sector, community and voluntary sectors, and not-for-profit
organisations.

Specific conditions may apply based on the type of support you are requesting.

####  **Self-employed people**

Self-employed people can also qualify. You are considered self-employed if
you:

  * Run your own business alone or with a partner 
  * Work for someone under a self-employed contract 
  * Run a franchised business as a self-employed person 

Some other specific qualifying criteria apply (see [ Appendix 2 of the
Operational Guidelines ](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/429d6-operational-

(TCAN). They must be a legal entity or a charity (or both) recognised by
Revenue.
