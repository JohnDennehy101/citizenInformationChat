##  Setting up a business

This page gives a step-by-step guide to starting a business in Ireland. It is
important that you meet all the requirements when starting a business to avoid
unnecessary delays, charges, and penalties.

If you are not an EU, EEA, UK or Swiss national and you want to open a
business in Ireland, you must apply for permission. Read about [ coming to set
up a business in Ireland as a non-EEA, UK or Swiss national
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/moving-country/working-in-
ireland/migrant-workers/coming-to-set-up-a-business-in-ireland/#lac4a4) .

##  Step 1: Develop your idea

The Local Enterprise Office (LEO) runs a [ free Start Your Own Business
programme ](https://www.localenterprise.ie/Discover-Business-
Supports/Training-Programmes/Start-Your-Own-Business-Programme/) which can
help you develop your business idea.

LEO has also published a [ 10-step-guide to starting your own business (pdf)
](https://www.localenterprise.ie/Documents-and-Publications/Ten-Step-Guide-to-
Starting-a-Business.pdf) . This guide includes information on business
development, assessing the viability of your business idea, the requirements
for your business such as staff, and how to write your business plan.

Find out [ how to get funding
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/employment/types-of-employment/self-
employment/starting-a-business/#6c48a3) to start your own business. You can
also get information on business grants below.

##  Step 2: Write your business plan and choose a business name

When you’re satisfied that your business idea is viable, the next step is [
developing a business plan ](/en/employment/types-of-employment/self-
employment/how-to-write-a-business-plan/) . A business plan outlines your
company’s goals and how you expect to achieve them. You will need a business
plan if you are applying for a loan or a business grant, or if pitching to
investors.

###  **Choose a business name**

If your company conducts its business under a name that is different to your
own name, you must register the business name with the Companies Registration
Office (CRO).

Find more information on [ registering your business name
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/employment/types-of-employment/self-
employment/becoming-self-employed/#ad8994) .

##  Step 3: Choose a legal structure

The legal structure of your business is important as it determines the type of
taxes you must pay and your personal liability for your business debts.

Types of legal structures in Ireland include:

  * Self-employed or sole trader 
  * Partnership 
  * Limited company 

Read about [ deciding on a legal structure for your business
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/employment/types-of-employment/self-
employment/starting-a-business/#9960e7) , including your tax and legal
obligations.

You can also read our [ guide to becoming self-employed
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/employment/types_of_employment/self_employment/self_employment_as_an_individual.html)
.

##  Step 4: Understand your tax

All businesses must pay tax. The amount of tax your business must pay depends
on its legal structure.

###  **Types of legal structures**

####  **Sole trader**

As a sole trader, you must pay the following taxes on your profits:

  * Income Tax 
  * Pay-Related Social Insurance (PRSI) 
  * Universal Social Charge (USC) 

####  **Partnership**

If you register as a partnership, each partner must pay income tax, PRSI and
USC on their share of the business profits.

####  **Limited company**

If you register as a limited company, you must pay [ Corporation Tax
](https://www.revenue.ie/en/companies-and-charities/corporation-tax-for-
companies/corporation-tax/index.aspx) , Income Tax, PRSI and USC on the
company profits.

Read more about [ deciding on the legal structure of your business
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/employment/types-of-employment/self-
employment/starting-a-business/#9960e7) .

###  **Other types of tax**

####  **VAT**

Whether you are a sole trader, a partnership, or a limited company, you must
charge [ Value Added Tax (VAT) ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/money-
and-tax/tax/duties-and-vat/value-added-tax/) on the sale of your goods and
services.

####  **Employers PRSI**

If you employ staff, you must pay Employers’ PRSI to Revenue for all employees
aged 16 and over.

Get more information on [ paying tax as a limited company
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/employment/types-of-employment/self-
employment/starting-a-business/#7469fc) , or read about [ paying tax as a sole
trader (including the tax reliefs available)
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/employment/types-of-employment/self-
employment/becoming-self-employed/#2845a6) . You can also read our page on [
understanding your tax as a business owner ](/en/employment/types-of-
employment/self-employment/understanding-your-tax-as-a-business-owner/) .

##  Step 5: Register employees

If you employ staff, you must register as an employer with Revenue. You can do
this by telling Revenue of your name, address and intention to pay staff.

You must register as an employer before you pay your employees, using the
MyEnquiries service on the [ Revenue Online Service (ROS)
](https://www.ros.ie/oidc/login?client_id=rosint_rp) .

Read more in our page on [ employing people in your business
](/en/employment/types-of-employment/self-employment/employing-people-in-your-
business/) .

##  Grants and other supports

There are several government agencies and organisations dedicated to
supporting new businesses across Ireland.
