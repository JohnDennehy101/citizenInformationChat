##  Introduction

The Taxsaver Commuter Ticket Scheme reduces the cost of using public
transport. Employers can make PRSI savings of up to 10.75%. Employees can save
between 28.5% and 52% of travel costs due to tax, PRSI and USC savings. The
ticket covers [ bus ](/en/travel-and-recreation/public-transport/bus-services-
in-ireland/) , [ rail ](/en/travel-and-recreation/public-transport/rail-
services-in-ireland/) , and the [ Luas tram system ](/en/travel-and-
recreation/public-transport/luas/) .

You can talk to your employer about participating in the scheme. Your employer
will then apply and buy your ticket. Employees cannot apply for the scheme or
buy the ticket themselves.

The Taxsaver scheme is run (in conjunction with the [ Revenue Commissioners
](http://www.revenue.ie/) ) by:

  * Dublin Bus 
  * Bus Éireann 
  * Luas 
  * Irish Rail 
  * Approved transport providers 

Employees can get tickets as part of their salary package (salary sacrifice)
instead of an annual cash bonus or as a benefit-in-kind.

Taxsaver tickets are not subject to tax, PRSI or USC. Employees must only pay
tax, PRSI, and USC on the ‘money’ portion of their salary. Employer PRSI is
also calculated on the ‘money’ portion of the employee's salary.

##  Taxsaver tickets and temporary reduction in fares

There is a 20% average reduction in Taxsaver fares from 1 April 2022 to the
end of 2024. This applies to all monthly and yearly tickets provided by
Iarnród Éireann, Bus Éireann, Dublin Bus, Luas, and Go-Ahead Ireland.

See [ taxsaver.ie ](https://www.taxsaver.ie/) for more information or contact
your employer to order a ticket.

##  How the Taxsaver scheme works

###  Who can apply for a Taxsaver ticket?

Employees, including company directors, can participate in the TaxSaver scheme
if their employer applies for and provides commuter tickets.

###  Contract between employer and employee

Employees who want to join the TaxSaver scheme [ select the ticket
](https://www.taxsaver.ie/Ticket-Types/) type they need. Employers and
employees then sign a contract setting out the terms of the Taxsaver scheme.
The Taxsaver contract (between the employer and employee) must be agreed upon
and signed before the employer applies for a Taxsaver ticket. Both parties
must review the conditions of the contract. For example, the contract should
state what happens if an employee leaves the company before the ticket expiry
date.

A signed Taxsaver contract usually lasts for 12 months. If, for example, an
employee goes on holiday during that time, they cannot return the ticket, or
get a refund for the time spent away and reclaim the ticket upon returning.

If an employee returns a ticket to an employer before the 12 months is up,
they can rejoin the scheme again after the 12-months have expired. However,
the company may get a refund for the portion of the year not used by the
employee.

Tickets are strictly non-transferable and cannot be exchanged for cash
benefits.

Once a contract between the employer and employee has been signed, the
employer applies the tax conditions set out below and applies to the relevant
transport provider.

###  Tax conditions

The terms and conditions of employment must be changed to refer to the
Taxsaver ticket (to highlight that you are choosing a benefit instead of
salary). The change must not be retrospective and must be in writing.

Employees cannot exchange the benefit for cash.

The choice to accept benefit instead of cash cannot be made more than once a
year, and then only with the consent of the employer.

###  Taxsaver payment options

Employees can participate in the scheme in one of 3 ways:

**Salary sacrifice**

Employees can get TaxSaver commuter tickets as part of their basic salary
package by choosing salary sacrifice.

**Example of salary sacrifice**

If the annual cost of a bus and rail ticket is €1,800 and an employee earns
€30,000 per annum: Instead of buying the ticket for €1,800, the employee can
agree to a ‘salary sacrifice’. So, their salary is reduced by €1,800 a year,
or €34.62 per week, to cover the cost of the annual ticket (€1,800 divided by
52 weeks).

The employee will not be charged tax, PRSI, or USC on the portion of salary
they sacrificed (€1,800). Instead, they only pay tax, PRSI and USC on €28,200.
(€30,000 minus €1,800).

The employer will claim an expense for salary paid to employees.

If an assumed 10.75% rate applies, the employer PRSI would be €3,031.5.
(10.75% of €28,200).

The employer will pay and claim €28,200 salary (plus employer PRSI) using
salary sacrifice. This comes to €3,031.5 (this is where the employer saves),
plus a deduction of €1,800 (the cost of the ticket).

The cost of the ticket is now regarded as an allowable expense for Section 118
(5A) of the Tax Consolidation Act 1997 as amended by [ Section 8 of the
Finance Act 2005
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2005/en/act/pub/0005/sec0008.html#parti-
chapii-sec8) .

**Example without salary sacrifice**

The employer will pay €30,000 in salary and claim an expense of €30,000 (plus
the employer PRSI). The employer PRSI would be €3,225. (10.75% of €30,000).

**Cash Bonus**

As an alternative to salary sacrifice, an employer can offer employees
TaxSaver commuter tickets instead of a cash bonus. As cash bonuses are taxed
and commuter tickets are not, tickets provide better value to employees than
cash bonuses.

**Benefits-in-kind**

A third way for employers and employees to benefit from the scheme is for
employers to offer employees TaxSaver commuter tickets as a benefit-in-kind.
For example, instead of a parking space at work, or as an incentive for an
employee to stay with the company.

##  Ticket types and prices

There are different [ types of monthly and annual tickets
](https://www.taxsaver.ie/Ticket-Types/) available. Tickets can also be used
for personal travel outside of office hours.

Monthly tickets are valid for one calendar month and can be bought up to 2
weeks in advance. Annual tickets are valid for one year from the first day of
any month and can be bought anytime.

##  How to apply

####  **Applying for the scheme**

  * Employees choose the TaxSaver commuter ticket type. 
  * The employer and employees sign a contract, subject to the rules of the scheme. 
  * The employer applies the required Tax Conditions and registers with the public transport provider. 
  * The employer makes a group application on behalf of employees by post, e-mail or online. 
  * Companies must keep a receipt of purchases and a copy of the ticket for their tax records.
