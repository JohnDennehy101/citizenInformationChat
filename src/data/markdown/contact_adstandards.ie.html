##  Frequently asked questions

Who is the Advertising Standards Authority?

We are an organisation who set the standards for Advertising in Ireland. Read
more here: [ About Us ](https://adstandards.ie/about-us/)

What does self-regulation mean?

Self-regulation is a system by which the advertising industry actively  
regulates itself. It contributes to responsible advertising and helps  
build consumer trust.

How do I make a complaint?

If you would like to inform us about an advertisement that you feel does not
comply with the Code, you can choose between completing an anonymous feedback
form or making a formal complaint.

Both forms can be found [ here  ](https://adstandards.ie/make-a-complaint/)

We do not except complaints via phone, in person or social media.

What marketing communications are covered under the Code?

The Code of Standards for Advertising and Marketing Communications in Ireland
applies to ALL commercial marketing communications and to sales promotions
that promote the sales of goods or services.

Can I make a complaint about an advertisement outside of Ireland?

We deal with complaints regarding advertisements in Ireland only. However, if
you wish to complain about an advertisement that appeared in media in another
country, you can get in touch with an advertising regulator in that country
e.g. for complaints relating to ads in the UK, including Northern Ireland, you
can contact [ ASA UK ](https://www.asa.org.uk/) , or for complaints relating
to ads appearing in France, you can contact [ The ARPP
](https://www.arpp.org/the-arpp/) . A full list of advertising regulators in
Europe can be found on [ EASA’s website ](https://www.easa-alliance.org/type-
of-member/self-regulatory-organisations/) .

Who can make a complaint?

Anyone can complain about any advertisement in Ireland.

How is the Advertising Standards Authority funded?

The self-regulatory system is funded entirely by the advertising industry and
involves no charge to consumers or to the State. Costs are shared across the
industry, ensuring that all advertising sectors participate but that none
exercises any special influence over our operations. This independent status
is a key factor in maintaining public confidence in the self-regulatory
system.

Do you provide a Copy Advice Service

Advertisers, agencies, media and promoters can obtain copy advice from the
Advertising Standards Authority on whether a proposed marketing communication
or sales promotion conforms to the Code. Copy advice is communicated
confidentially, is non-binding and is given free of charge. It is not
definitive advice as to whether a proposed marketing communication or sales
promotion would, if later complained about, lead to a finding by the
Complaints Committee that it did or did not conform to the Code. Rather, it is
an authorative opinion, given by the Executive, which does not bind the
Advertising Standards Authority.

The Advertising Standards Authority will be in no way liable for any
consequences that flow from a decision to heed or ignore Copy Advice.

What happens if an advertisement is found in breach of the code

If an advertisement is found to be in breach of the Irish advertising Code, it
must be removed and/or amended.

In addition, decisions are released to the Irish media and often receive
considerable media attention.
