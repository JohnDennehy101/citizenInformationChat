##  Introduction

Driving offences in Ireland are set out in the [ Road Traffic Acts 1961 (as
amended)
](https://revisedacts.lawreform.ie/eli/1961/act/24/front/revised/en/html) .

Penalties on conviction for a driving offence vary and are determined
principally by the severity of the offence and the number of offences you have
committed in the past. They can include monetary fines, endorsement of your
driving licence [ with penalty points ](https://www.rsa.ie/en/RSA/Licensed-
Drivers/Penalty-points/How-it-works-why-it-matters/) , disqualification from
driving and, in the most severe cases, [ imprisonment ](/en/justice/criminal-
law/criminal-trial/types-of-sentences/) .

This page outlines the rules governing the disqualification of driving licence
holders in Ireland.

It includes information on:

  * The operation of disqualification orders 
  * The various types of disqualification orders; and 
  * How to apply for the restoration of your licence after being disqualified 

The disqualification of drivers and the enforcement of the various provisions
is a [ shared responsibility
](http://www.justice.ie/en/JELR/Pages/RoadTrafficMatters) of the [ Road Safety
Authority (RSA) ](https://www.rsa.ie/) , the [ Department of Transport
](https://www.gov.ie/en/organisation/department-of-transport-tourism-and-
sport/) , the [ Courts Service ](https://www.courts.ie/) and [ An Garda
Síochána ](https://www.garda.ie/en/) .

You can read more about different types of [ driving offences and their
associated penalties ](/en/travel-and-recreation/motoring/driving-
offences/driving-offences/) . You can also get information on [ penalty points
for driving offences ](/en/travel-and-recreation/motoring/driving-
offences/penalty-points-for-driving-offences/) .

##  Operation of disqualification orders

In general, there are 2 ways you can be disqualified from driving.

Either:

  * You get too many penalty points (endorsements) on your licence or learner permit within a set period of time; or 
  * You are convicted of a driving offence for which the penalty imposed requires you to be disqualified from driving 

###  Disqualification through penalty points

A [ penalty point ](/en/travel-and-recreation/motoring/driving-
offences/penalty-points-for-driving-offences/) is essentially a formal
reprimand by the Gardaí endorsed on your driving licence record that shows you
are guilty of a specific driving offence.

Penalty points are recorded on your driving licence when:

  * You are convicted in court of a driving offence that attracts penalty points; or 
  * You pay [ a fixed charge notice ](/en/travel-and-recreation/motoring/driving-offences/driving-offences/) that was issued to you for an offence that also carries penalty points 

If you get 12 penalty points in any 3 year period, you are automatically
disqualified from driving for 6 months.

Similarly, [ learner permit drivers ](/en/travel-and-
recreation/motoring/driver-licensing/learner-driving-permits-for-cars-and-
work-vehicles/) and new drivers who are within two years of receiving their
first full licence are disqualified if they get 7 penalty points.

If you exceed your penalty point threshold, you will receive a letter from
either the Courts Service or the RSA indicating the date on which your period
of disqualification will begin and requesting that you surrender your licence
within 14 days of that date (for more see, ‘Surrendering your licence’ below).

###  Disqualification through conviction

Not all driving offences resulting in an automatic disqualification require
you to attend court. In most cases, a Garda will issue you with [ a fixed
charge notice ](https://www.garda.ie/en/Roads-Policing/Fixed-Charge-Notices/)
setting out the fine payable and you have the option of paying the fixed
charge and accepting the associated period of disqualification or allowing the
matter to proceed to court.

For example, if you hold a valid licence or learner permit at the time of
committing [ a drink driving offence ](/en/travel-and-
recreation/motoring/driving-offences/drink-driving-offences-in-ireland/) and
your alcohol level is below a certain limit, you may be issued with a fixed
charge. If you pay the fine stated on the notice within 28 days, the
disqualification order associated with the offence will be imposed but you
will not have to go to court.

However, the Gardaí do [ have the power to arrest you
](/en/justice/arrests/arrests/) for some offences, such as drink driving or
dangerous driving, and a small number of very serious offences result in [
automatic summons to court ](/en/justice/criminal-law/criminal-trial/summons/)
without the option of paying a fixed charge.

You can find out more about how [ criminal trials ](/en/justice/criminal-
law/criminal-trial/criminal-trial/) work. You can also read about [ criminal
legal aid ](/en/justice/legal-aid-and-advice/criminal-legal-aid/) and the
services available from [ Free Legal Advice Centres (FLAC) and Citizen
Information Services ](/en/justice/legal-aid-and-advice/free-legal-advice-
centre/) .

###  Surrendering your licence

Depending on the type of disqualification order made by the court (for more,
see 'Types of disqualification orders'), you will be required to surrender
your licence to the [ National Driver Licence Service (NDLS)
](https://www.ndls.ie/about-us.html) within 10 or 14 days of the order
commencing.

Upon receiving your licence, the NDLS updates your driver record to reflect
the fact that your licence has been received. If it is not received, no
amendment is made. Upon being disqualified from driving, your record will also
be updated on the [ National Vehicle and Driver File (NVDF)
](https://www.gov.ie/en/policy-information/1ba443-motor-taxvehicle-
registration/) . The NDLS retain your driving licence until the expiration of
your period of disqualification, or until the removal of your disqualification
order, and return it to you.

It is an offence not to surrender your licence, which carries a maximum fine
of €1,000 on first conviction and up to €2,000 on a second or further
conviction.

The penalty for driving while disqualified is a fine of up to €5,000 and/or a
prison term of 6 months.

###  Making an appeal

If you are convicted of a driving offence and disqualified from driving, you
generally have 14 days to appeal the decision to [ the Circuit Court
](/en/justice/courts-system/circuit-court/) .

To [ initiate an appeal ](https://courts.ie/appeals-circuit-court) , you
should lodge a notice of appeal together with a statutory declaration of
service with [ the District Court Clerk in the court area
](https://courts.ie/content/find-us) where the decision to disqualify you was
made. If you decide to appeal the conviction, your disqualification will be
suspended pending the outcome of your appeal.

##  Types of disqualification orders

There are 3 types of driver disqualification orders in Ireland. Which order
you receive depends on the nature of the offence which led to your
disqualification.

###  1\. Consequential disqualification

Consequential disqualification arises as a matter of course if you are
convicted of an offence for which the law mandates automatic disqualification.
The court does not have discretion in relation to convictions in this
category.

For example, penalties on conviction for dangerous driving causing death are
the same as penalties for manslaughter and also carry a mandatory
disqualification from driving for a minimum of 4 years. Similarly, since
October 2011, all convictions in the District Court for drink driving offences
carry a mandatory disqualification from driving for a minimum of 6 months.

If a consequential disqualification order is made by a court, the driver
generally has 10 days to surrender their licence. If, however, the
disqualification follows from having too many penalty points, the driver has
14 days to surrender their licence.

###  2\. Ancillary Disqualification

An ancillary disqualification is within the discretion of the court to apply
and can be imposed as a penalty for any offence under the Road Traffic Act
1961 which does not mandate consequential disqualification. The court will
decide how long the disqualification order will last based on the severity of
the offence and the perceived likelihood of the perpetrator re-offending.

For example, if you are convicted of driving without due care and attention,
the law does not require that you be disqualified from driving (a
consequential disqualification). But if you have a record of driving offences,
the court may determine it proportional to impose an ancillary
disqualification order.

If an ancillary disqualification order is made by a court, the driver
generally has 10 days to surrender their licence.

###  3\. Special Disqualification

The District Court has the discretion to disqualify a driver as a consequence
of an application made to it by a member of An Garda Síochána submitting that
a person is unfit to driver a motor vehicle by reason of:

  * Physical disease; 
  * Physical or mental disability; or 
  * Incompetence 

Special disqualification orders occur infrequently, with only a handful of
such cases being taken each year. If a special disqualification order is made
by a court, the driver generally has 14 days to surrender their licence or
make an appeal to the Circuit Court.

##  What happens if I commit a driving offence abroad?

Penalty points and endorsements on driving licences received in other
countries (including EU/EEA member states) do not transfer between states.
This means that if you got penalty points abroad or already have endorsements
on your driving licence before coming to Ireland, these penalty points or
endorsements will not transfer over to an Irish driving licence.

If, however, you have been disqualified from driving in another country and
this was **in addition to a prison sentence** for driving offences it may not
be possible for you to [ exchange your full foreign driving licence
](/en/travel-and-recreation/motoring/driver-licensing/exchanging-foreign-
driving-permit/) for a full driving licence here in Ireland.

The situation is different between Ireland and the UK (including Northern
Ireland) for [ driving disqualifications for specified offences
](https://www.rsa.ie/services/licensed-drivers/mutual-recognition-of-
disqualifications-ireland-and-uk) . This is provided for by [ Section 40 of
the Road Traffic Act 2016
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2016/act/21/section/40/enacted/en/html#sec40)
.

Under this agreement between Ireland and the UK, if you hold an Irish licence
and you are disqualified from driving for committing a serious offence in the
UK, you may also be disqualified from driving in Ireland.

The District Court can make an order to disqualify you from driving in Ireland
for the offence that was committed in the UK. The same rules apply if you are
driving in Ireland on an UK licence, although the UK authorities can
disqualify you without taking separate court action.

##  How to apply for the restoration of your licence

If you have been disqualified from driving, [ you can apply for your driving
licence to be restored ](https://courts.ie/restoring-driving-licence) .

You make the application [ to the District Court
](https://courts.ie/content/find-us) where the order to disqualify you was
made. An application costs €55. You must be more than halfway through your
disqualification period before you can make an application.

Your driving licence will not be restored if:

  * The disqualification is for 2 years or less 
  * You have been given another disqualification in the past 10 years 

The court can reduce the period of disqualification to two-thirds of the
original period of disqualification or to 2 years, whichever is the greater.

When a court is considering an application for the restoration of a driving
licence it will look at the nature of the offence, the character of the
applicant and the conduct of the applicant after conviction.

You can get further information and the forms you need from the District Court
clerk.
