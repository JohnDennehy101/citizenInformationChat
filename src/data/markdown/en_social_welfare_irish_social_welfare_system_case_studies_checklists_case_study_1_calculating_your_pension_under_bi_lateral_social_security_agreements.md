#  Case study: Calculating your pension under EU social security agreements

  * Case study 

##  Case study

###  This example shows how entitlement to State Pension (Contributory) is
calculated under EU social security agreements.

###  Case study

Peter is turning 66 years of age in 2024 and wants to know if he will qualify
for a State Pension (Contributory).

Peter entered insurable employment 40 years ago. He started his working life
in Ireland and worked in Ireland for 2 years in total. He has worked in
Ireland for the last 5 years and before that he worked in Germany for 23 years
and paid 1,196 contributions there.

He doesn't have any breaks in his employment record in Germany, that is, he
worked in Germany continuously for 23 years immediately before coming back to
Ireland. He therefore has 364 Irish contributions and 1,196 German
contributions.

Peter's wife Maria is 61 years of age, her only income is from work. She earns
€250 per week.

####  **Step 1**

First, you must check whether Peter would qualify for an Irish State Pension
based on his Irish contributions alone.

You can calculate this by dividing the total number of Irish contributions
(364) by the total number of years worked (40) since entering insurable
employment.

**Yearly average number of contributions calculation** Peter’s Irish contributions  |  364   
---|---  
Total number of years worked*  |  40   
Yearly average number of contributions  |  364 ÷ 40 = **9.1**  
  
*since entering into insurable employment to the end of the last complete tax year before reaching pension age 

Peter's yearly average number of contributions is 9.1. He would not qualify
for an Irish State Pension (Contributory).

####  **Step 2**

Second, you must calculate Peter’s ‘notional rate of pension’. This is the
rate of State Pension (Contributory) Peter would be entitled to if all his
contributions were assessed as Irish contributions.

You can calculate this by dividing the total number of contributions, both
Irish and foreign (1,560), by the total number of years worked since entering
insurable employment (40).

**Yearly average number of contributions calculation** Total assessable contributions  |  364 Irish contributions + 1,196 German contributions = 1,560   
---|---  
Total number of years worked*  |  40   
Yearly average number of contributions  |  1,560 ÷ 40 = **39**  
  
*since entering insurable employment to the end of the last complete tax year before reaching pension age 

Peter's yearly average number of contributions is 39, so his notional rate of
pension is €249.30 (in 2024, this is the rate paid for people with a yearly
average of 30-39 contributions).

However, Peter is also entitled to an increase in his payment for his wife,
but he is not entitled to the maximum rate of increase for a qualified adult
because she is earning €250 per week.

The rate of qualified adult increase payable is tapered for earnings between
€100 and €310. The increase for his wife as a qualified adult is €71.70.

To get Peter’s total notional pension rate, add the first notional rate of
pension (€249.30) to the increase he gets for his wife (€71.70).

**Total notional pension rate calculation** Notional rate of pension (calculated above)  |  €249.30   
---|---  
Increase for a qualified adult  |  €71.70   
Total notional pension rate  |  €249.30 + €71.70 = **€321**  
  
Peter’s total notional pension rate is €321.

####  **Step 3**

Third, you calculate what pension Peter would get under EU social security
agreements. You can do this by applying the following formula:

  * (A x B) ÷ C = rate of State Pension (Contributory) 

**Figures for pension calculation** A = Notional rate of pension (calculated in step 2)  |  €321   
---|---  
B = Number of Irish contributions  |  364   
C = Total number of contributions (Irish and foreign)  |  1,560   
  
First, you multiply the notional rate of pension (A) by the total number of
Irish contributions (B):

  * €321 x 364 = €116,844 

Then, you divide €116,844 by the total number of Irish and foreign
contributions (C):

  * €116,844 ÷ 1,560 = €74.38 

**Peter’s rate of State Pension (Contributory), calculated under EU security
agreements and including an increase for his wife as a qualified dependant, is
€74.38.**
