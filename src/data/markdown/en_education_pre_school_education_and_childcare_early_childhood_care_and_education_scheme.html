  * How to apply for ECCE 
  * Where to apply for ECCE 

##  Introduction

The Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) Scheme provides early childhood
care and education for children of pre-school age.

Children can start ECCE when they are 2 years and 8 months of age and continue
until they transfer to primary school (provided that they are not older than 5
years and 6 months at the end of the pre-school year) - see 'Is my child
eligible for ECCE' below.

The State pays participating playschools and daycare services a set amount per
child for the ECCE service. In return, participating centres and playschools
provide a pre-school service free of charge to all children within the
qualifying age range. The service is for a set number of hours over a set
period of weeks see ‘How the ECCE scheme is provided’ below.

You may get financial support from the National Childcare Scheme (NCS) towards
the cost of childcare for the hours spent outside of ECCE.

Your child cannot be enrolled in the ECCE Programme and [ Early Start
Programme ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/education/pre-school-
education-and-childcare/early-start/) at the same time.

##  Is my child eligible for ECCE?

**Eligible age range**

The programme is available to children who have turned 2 years and 8 months of
age before 1 September. Children can continue in the programme until they
transfer to primary school if they are not older than 5 years and 6 months at
the end of the pre-school year on 30 June.

The Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth
(DCEDIY) has an [ eligibility calendar showing when your child can participate
in the ECCE programme ](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/2459ee-early-
childhood-care-and-education-programme-ecce/) .

**Exemptions from age limit**

If your child has special needs they may get an exemption from the ECCE upper
age limit. For more information and to apply for an exemption contact [
EYQueries@equality.gov.ie ](mailto:EYQueries@equality.gov.ie) .

There are no exemptions to the lower age limit.

###  How the ECCE scheme is provided

The childcare provider must provide ECCE for 3 hours a day, 5 days a week for
38 weeks a year.

**Sessional services**

If your child attends a half-day or “sessional” service, such as a playschool,
naíonra, Montessori or parent and toddler group, the normal pattern for the
free ECCE scheme school year is 3 hours a day for 5 days a week over the
school year. If your child attends for more than this, you will be charged for
the extra time.

A small number of sessional services that cannot open for 5 days a week
provide 3 hours and 30 minutes a day for 4 days a week over the school year.
This only applies to services which have already been granted permission.

**Daycare services**

For full-time or part-time daycare services, the normal pattern for the free
ECCE scheme is 3 hours per day for 5 days a week. If your child attends for
longer than this each day, you will be charged for the extra time.

**If your child does not attend**

Your child may lose their ECCE place, if they have not attended ECCE for 4
consecutive weeks. In special circumstances, a child can keep their place if
they are absent for more than 4 consecutive weeks. For example, in the case of
a prolonged illness a place can be kept for up to 12 weeks. A place may be
kept for up to 6 weeks in the case of a bereavement.

###  Content and quality of service

Childcare services taking part in the ECCE scheme must provide an appropriate
pre-school educational programme which adheres to the principles of [ Síolta
](http://www.siolta.ie/) and [ Aistear,
](https://ncca.ie/media/4152/aistear_siolta_similarities_differences_.pdf) the
national frameworks for early years care and education. Síolta co-ordinators
and staff of the local City/County Childcare Committee (CCC) will support
participating services with assistive visits and advice.

The website of the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration
and Youth has [ further information on the ECCE scheme
](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/2459ee-early-childhood-care-and-education-
programme-ecce/) .

###  Children with special needs

The [ **Access and Inclusion Model (AIM)** ](https://aim.gov.ie/) supports
children with disabilities to access the ECCE programme. The model is based on
the needs of the child and does not require a diagnosis of disability.

AIM has 7 levels of support, moving from universal to targeted support
depending on the needs of the child and the pre-school provider. The model
offers tailored, practical supports based on a child’s needs.

All children can access Levels 1 – 3 of the model. These involve a suite of
universal supports which are designed to promote and support an inclusive
culture within pre-school settings by means of educational and capacity-
building initiatives for providers and practitioners.

Where a pre-school service provider, along with the parent, considers that
additional support may be necessary to meet a child’s needs, they can apply
for one or more additional targeted supports under levels 4 – 7 of the model.

Additional targeted supports may include:

  * Expert educational advice and mentoring – Level 4 
  * Specialised equipment, appliances and minor alterations – Level 5 
  * Therapeutic supports – Level 6 
  * Additional capitation to fund extra assistance in the ECCE pre-school room – level 7. 

When you have identified a pre-school for your child, your service provider,
in consultation with you, will consider what supports may be needed to ensure
your child’s participation in pre-school.

Where it is considered that your child needs additional support, your pre-
school service provider can apply, in partnership with you, for targeted
supports under AIM.

The [ AIM website ](https://aim.gov.ie/) provides [ information for parents
](https://aim.gov.ie/parents/) and [ Frequently Asked Questions
](http://www.preschoolaccess.ie/faqs/) on supports available. Your local City
or County Childcare Committee will also be able to provide you with
information and guidance on AIM.

##  Is there a charge for ECCE?

There is no charge to parents for the playschool or daycare hours provided
under the ECCE scheme. The Department pays the playschool or daycare service
to provide these ECCE hours. However, if your child attends for extra hours,
you will have to pay for these extra hours in the normal way.

A service may charge parents for extra activities. However, these must be
optional and the service must provide other appropriate activities to children
who don’t take part in the optional activity being charged for.

**Booking deposits**

The service may ask you for a booking deposit, which cannot be more than 4
weeks of ECCE capitation payments. Any deposit you pay must be repaid to you
by the end of October of the year your child starts.

**Rates for service providers**

For providers of daycare and sessional services, the Department pays a weekly
fee for each child over the school year. Daycare and sessional playschools
with more highly qualified staff may be able to qualify for a higher fee.

##  How to apply for ECCE

To get a place for your child, apply to a participating playschool or daycare
centre. You can get a list of participating services from your local City or
County Childcare Committee (CCC) – see ‘Where to apply’ below.

You will need to provide a copy of your child's birth certificate or passport
and [ PPS number ](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/personal-
public-service-number/) .

**Supports for children with special needs**

If your child needs additional support, your pre-school provider can apply, in
partnership with you, for targeted supports under AIM. Applications are made
through the Programmes Implementation Platform (PIP) on the Pobal website.
Your pre-school service provider will be familiar with the Pobal website and
with PIP.

The application process is open and will remain open throughout the year.

Applications can only be made with your full consent.

For advice and support from the Early Years Specialist Service (Access and
Inclusion) contact (01) 511 7222 or e-mail: Onlinesupport@pobal.ie
