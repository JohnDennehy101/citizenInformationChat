##  Introduction

A learner permit is a document issued by the [ National Driver Licensing
Service (NDLS) ](https://www.ndls.ie/index.php) . It allows you to learn to
drive on public roads in Ireland and you must always have it with you when you
are driving.

You cannot take driving lessons without a valid learner permit and, in most
cases, you cannot take a driving test until you have had your first learner
permit for [ at least 6 months ](https://www.rsa.ie/en/RSA/Learner-
Drivers/Safe-Driving1/6-Month-Rule/) . Read more about how to [ arrange and
prepare for a driving test in Ireland ](/en/travel-and-
recreation/motoring/driving-tests/driving-test/) .

This page provides practical guidance and advice on learner driving permits in
Ireland. It includes information on learner permits for:

  * Cars 
  * Motorcycles 
  * Buses and trucks 
  * Trailers

##  Learner permits for cars

A Category B learner permit entitles you to learn to drive a car on public
roads in Ireland. However, it is not a full driving licence and you must keep
to certain restrictions.

###  **Rules** :

  * You must always have someone with a full driving licence in the car with you when you are driving on a learner permit. This person must have had their driving licence for at least 2 years. If the Gardaí stop you, and you are not accompanied by a qualified driver, they can detain the car. 
  * You must display L-plates to the front and rear of the vehicle at all times while driving. The plate should be a red ‘L’ on a white background and should not be less than 15cm high with a border of at least 2cm. 
  * You must keep to a [ reduced drink driving limit ](/en/travel-and-recreation/motoring/driving-offences/drink-driving-offences-in-ireland/) and [ penalty point disqualification threshold ](/en/travel-and-recreation/motoring/driving-offences/penalty-points-for-driving-offences/) . 
  * You must not drive on a motorway. 
  * You must not to draw a trailer. 
  * You must not act as an accompanying driver. 
  * You must not carry other people for reward. 

If you own a car, you will be guilty of an offence if you let someone drive it
in a public place when they:

  * Don’t have a driving licence or learner permit; or 
  * Have a learner permit but drive your car without being accompanied by a qualified driver 

For further information, consult the learner permit section of the Road Safety
Authority’s [ ‘Rules of the Road’ (pdf) ](https://www.rsa.ie/docs/default-
source/services/s1.8-learner-driver-resources/rules-of-the-
road-2020.pdf?sfvrsn=6d948b39_2) handbook.

###  **Essential Driver Training**

All holders of their first learner permit issued from 4 April 2011 must
undertake Essential Driver Training (EDT) with an RSA Approved Driving
Instructor (ADI). You can access [ details of ADIs
](http://www.rsa.ie/en/RSA/Learner-Drivers/Finding-an-instructor/Find-an-
instructor/) located across the country.

EDT is a training course that teaches fundamental driving skills to learner
car drivers. The RSA has published [ detailed guidance (pdf) on EDT
](https://www.rsa.ie/docs/default-source/services/s1.2-get-
qualified/essential-driver-training-a5-mar19-v4.pdf?sfvrsn=4f5a68f2_5) . The
course is made up of 12 individual 1 hour sessions.

At each EDT session, your ADI will check your learner permit and record the
session with a stamp and signature in your official EDT logbook. You will be
required to produce your completed [ EDT logbook
](https://www.rsa.ie/docs/default-source/services/s1.2-get-qualified/edt-
learner-logbook.pdf?sfvrsn=210f2346_5) on the day of the driving test.

You can also [ nominate a sponsor ](https://www.rsa.ie/services/learner-
drivers/driving-lessons/car-driving-lessons-\(edt\)) to accompany you during
your EDT sessions. Typically a family member or close friend, your sponsor
should be an experienced licence-holder who can support you in preparing for
your test.

If you have a full driving licence from a country that does not have a [
licence exchange agreement with Ireland ](/en/travel-and-
recreation/motoring/driver-licensing/exchanging-foreign-driving-permit/) , you
will only be required to complete 6 EDT sessions before taking the Irish
driving test. The RSA have published a [ detailed handbook on Reduced EDT
(pdf)
](https://www.ndls.ie/images/Documents/Forms/169030%20RSA%20Foreign%20Licence%20\(Reduced%20EDT\)%201305_Web_HR.pdf)
.

##  Learner permits for motorcycles

To drive a motorcycle on a public road, you must hold at least a learner
driving permit for the [ appropriate category of motorcycle ](/en/travel-and-
recreation/motoring/driver-licensing/categories-of-motor-vehicles-and-minimum-
age-of-drivers-in-ireland/) . The following table shows the categories of
motorcycles, with the driver’s minimum age:

**Category** |  **Vehicle type** |  **Minimum age of driver**

###  **Initial Basic Training**

Once you have passed your theory test and obtained a motorcycle learner
permit, you are not permitted drive on a public road until you have completed
your Initial Basic Training (IBT).

IBT is a 16-hour mandatory training course, broken into [ 4 separate modules
](https://www.rsa.ie/services/learner-drivers/driving-lessons/motorcycling-
lessons-\(ibt\)) , that teaches basic riding skills to learner motorcyclists.
IBT courses are only available at RSA approved IBT training centres and may
only be delivered by [ RSA approved IBT instructors
](https://www.rsa.ie/services/learner-drivers/driving-lessons/find-an-
instructor/ibt) .

You can [ read detailed information (pdf) ](https://www.rsa.ie/docs/default-

lessons-\(ibt\)) .

###  **Rules**

Once you get your IBT Certificate of Satisfactory Completion, you are allowed
to drive unaccompanied on public roads.

However, a learner permit is not a full motorcycle driving licence and there
are specific rules you must keep to until you pass your driving test:

  * You must display L plates. The L plates for a motorcyclist are displayed on a yellow fluorescent hi-viz tabard (a bib or sleeveless top with open side-seams). The letter L must be in red, measure at least 15cm in height on a white background, and be visible on the front and back of your body. 
  * You cannot drive on a motorway 
  * You cannot carry pillion passengers (passengers on the back of your motorcycle)

The RSA have [ published videos
](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhHyUMSn31s&list=PLi8nqrsVU6htP1YK5ndBd7qr2WRgji530)
on trailer licencing and safety, including a [ video of a trailer test
](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2ZjT5Hrg8c) . You can read more about how
to book and prepare for a driving test.

You can also access [ a comprehensive handbook (pdf)
](https://www.rsa.ie/docs/default-source/road-safety/r3-education/road-safety-
advice-for-drawing-light-trailers.pdf?sfvrsn=10e95c38_3) on driver licensing
rules for drawing light trailers and read [ information on load security
](https://www.rsa.ie/road-safety/road-users/professional-drivers/vehicle-
safety-legislation/light-trailers/loading-and-load-security) .

###  **Rules**

While driving with a learner permit, you must:

  * Always be accompanied by someone with a current driving licence for the same category of drawing vehicle plus trailer (and they must have had their driving licence for at least 2 years). 
  * Always display L plates to the front and rear of the vehicle you are driving. The plate should show a red L on a white background and should be at least 15cm high with a border of at least 2cm. 

While driving with a learner permit, you must not:

  * Drive on a motorway 
  * Act as an accompanying driver for that category 
  * Carry other people for reward or payment 

The drink driving limit for drivers with trailers with learner permits or full
driving licences is 20mg per 100ml of blood. Further information on [ drink
driving limits ](https://www.drinkdriversdestroylives.ie/drink-driving-fast-
facts/) is available from the RSA.

Finally, remember that the maximum speed limit for a vehicle towing a trailer
is 80km/h, and this also applies on roads where the posted road sign speed
limit is higher. As always drivers are subject to the lowest posted speed sign
so it will not always be possible to travel at 80km/h.
