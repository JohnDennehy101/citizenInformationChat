##  Introduction

The Irish Constitution (or Bunreacht na hÉireann) was ratified by the Irish
people in 1937. It is the fundamental law of the State.

Every part of the Constitution is set out in both the Irish and English
languages. [ Article 8
](https://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/cons/en/html#part2) states that the
Irish language is the first official language and that the English language is
recognised as a second official language.

The Constitution establishes the branches or [ organs of government
](/en/government-in-ireland/irish-constitution-1/main-institutions-of-the-
state/) , it establishes the courts and sets out how those institutions should
be run. It also describes the [ fundamental rights ](/en/government-in-
ireland/irish-constitution-1/constitution-fundamental-rights/) of every Irish
citizen.

The Constitution is also part of a wider _human rights framework_ in Ireland.
This refers to all legal and other human rights commitments made by Ireland,
including treaties under the [ United Nations
](http://www.un.org/en/index.html) , the European Convention on Human Rights
and the [ Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union
](/en/government-in-ireland/european-government/eu-law/charter-of-fundamental-
rights/) .

##  Structure of the Constitution

The Constitution contains 50 articles.

[ Articles 1-39 ](https://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/cons/en/html#part1)
define the [ functions of the State and its agencies ](/en/government-in-
ireland/irish-constitution-1/main-institutions-of-the-state/) and set out the
separation of powers in the State.

[ Articles 40-44 ](https://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/cons/en/html#part13)
provide for the [ fundamental rights of Irish citizens ](/en/government-in-
ireland/irish-constitution-1/constitution-fundamental-rights/) .

The remaining articles are:

[ Article 45 ](https://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/cons/en/html#part14) ,
which sets out directive principles of social policy

[ Article 46 ](https://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/cons/en/html#part15) ,
which sets out how the Constitution may be amended

[ Article 47 ](https://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/cons/en/html#part16) ,
which governs referendums

[ Articles 48-50 ](https://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/cons/en/html#part17) ,
which repealed the previous Constitution (of Saorstát Éireann) and ensured the
continuance of laws

##  The Constitution and legislation

One of the most important Articles of the Constitution is [ Article 15.4
](https://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/cons/en/html#part4) , which states that
the Oireachtas must not enact any law that is _repugnant_ to the Constitution
(conflicts with the Constitution). This means that the Constitution is
superior to all other law.

If any element of an existing law is found to be repugnant to the
Constitution, that element of the law is invalid (Article 15.4.2).

If a proposed new law would be repugnant to the Constitution, it cannot be
enacted unless the Constitution has been amended accordingly – see 'Amending
the Constitution' below.

[ Article 25 ](https://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/cons/en/html#article20)
provides that Bills passed by both houses of the Oireachtas should be
presented to the President for signature. Once a Bill has been signed by the
President, it becomes law. However, Article 26 provides that the President may
refer the Bill to the Supreme Court to decide if it is [ repugnant to the
Constitution ](/en/government-in-ireland/how-government-works/standards-and-
accountability/unconstitutional-legislation-and-decisions/) . The President
will not sign the Bill into law if the Supreme Court decides against it.

Every law that is enacted is presumed to be constitutional until it is proven
not to be. The High Court has the power or jurisdiction to cancel any law or
part of any law that is repugnant to the Constitution.

##  Amending the Constitution

The consent of the Irish people is needed before the Constitution can be
amended. This means that amendments to the Constitution can only be made by
way of a [ constitutional referendum ](/en/government-in-ireland/elections-
and-referenda/types-of-elections-and-referendums/constitutional-referendum-in-
ireland/) . To date, 40 constitutional referendums have been held, of which 32
resulted in amendments to the Constitution. A [ list of the amending Acts
](https://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/cons/en/) is at the front of the
Constitution published on irishstatutebook.ie.

If no petition challenging the result is presented to the High Court within 7
days of its publication, the certificate becomes final. The President will
then sign the Bill to change the Constitution and the Constitution will be
amended.
