##  Introduction

A solicitor is a type of lawyer who is qualified to offer legal advice and
services.

Unlike barristers, solicitors are allowed to join together to form [
partnerships ](https://www.lsra.ie/for-law-professionals/limited-liability-
partnerships/) and they are allowed to advertise their services.

Experienced and/or specialist solicitors can also [ apply to become a senior
counsel ](https://www.lsra.ie/for-law-professionals/applications-for-senior-
counsel/) and use the letters SC after their name. Solicitors who are
appointed senior counsel remain solicitors.

##  What does a solicitor do?

Solicitors have a wide range of different functions.

###  Legal advice

A solicitor may give you legal advice about:

  * Property matters, such as [ buying a house or flat ](/en/housing/owning-a-home/buying-a-home/steps-involved-buying-a-home/) , referred to as ‘conveyancing’ 
  * Bereavement matters, such as [ drafting a will ](/en/death/before-a-death/making-a-will/) , [ powers of attorney ](/en/death/before-a-death/power-of-attorney/) or [ dealing with the estate of somebody who has died ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/death/the_deceaseds_estate/)
  * Disputes or disagreements you have with another party, for example, with your family, employer or [ neighbour ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/justice/neighbour_disputes/)
  * Taking or defending a case, for example if you have been involved in an accident or traffic collision 
  * Any other legal matter you bring before them 

Your solicitor may represent you in any of these matters and deal with the
other party in the case on your behalf.

###  Solicitors in court

If you are involved in a court case, your solicitor will manage the case and
represent you when dealing with the other party.

Your solicitor will:

  * Send letters to the other party on your behalf 
  * File all necessary court documents 
  * Contact any [ witnesses ](/en/justice/witnesses/being-a-witness/) called to give [ evidence ](/en/justice/evidence/evidence-introduction/) in the case 

If it is necessary to involve a [ barrister
](/en/justice/courtroom/barristers/) in the case, your solicitor will brief
the barrister by sending them all of the necessary documents and information.

Your solicitor may also actually represent you in court, although in the [
High Court ](/en/justice/courts-system/high-court/) and the [ Supreme Court
](/en/justice/courts-system/supreme-court/) , a barrister will usually be
engaged. Solicitors do not have to wear any special clothes when in court.

If there is a barrister involved in the case, the solicitor will usually sit
facing the barrister in the bench under the [ judge
](/en/justice/courtroom/judge/) . If the barrister needs a matter to be
clarified, he or she can then lean over to ask the solicitor.

You can read more about the [ functions and duties of different individuals in
a court of law. ](/en/justice/courtroom/functions-and-duties-of-individuals-
in-a-court-of-law#l4b249)

##  How much does a solicitor cost?

Solicitors’ fees vary depending on the nature of the legal work completed.

You are legally entitled to clear written information about the costs of legal
services you receive. This usually comes in two parts.

###  1\. Costs Notice, or Notice of Costs

Your solicitor is required to set out the likely costs of the legal services
to be provided before you agree to proceed further. This is called a Costs
Notice, or a Notice of Costs.

If your solicitor is not able to provide you with the exact costs, they must
still give you a Costs Notice which explains how the costs will be calculated.
They must update you in writing with details of the actual costs as soon as
they become aware of this.

###  2\. Bill of Costs

When the legal services have been provided and it is time for you to pay, your
solicitor must give you a breakdown of all the charges. This is called a Bill
of Costs.

This should contain a summary of the legal services you received, details of
the charges incurred, details on how you can challenge any aspect of the bill,
and other information relating to the case and calculation of costs.

You usually have 30 days to pay the bill, or, if you are not satisfied with
any aspect of the bill, you have 21 days to write to your solicitor and
outline your concerns which they must try to resolve informally with you.

###  No foal, no fee

Many solicitors take on cases on a "no foal, no fee" basis. This means that
you will not be charged a fee by your solicitor if you do not win the case.
This is most common in personal injuries cases (where you have been injured in
an accident).

You can read more about legal fees on the websites of [ the Law Society
](https://www.lawsociety.ie/public/Legal-guides/you--your-solicitor/legal-
charges) and [ the Legal Services Regulatory Authority (LSRA)
](https://www.lsra.ie/for-consumers/your-legal-bill-explained/) .

##  How to become a solicitor

To become a solicitor, you must complete an apprenticeship of at least 2 years
and you must pass exams set by [ the Law Society ](https://www.lawsociety.ie/)
at Blackhall Place in Dublin. You can read about [ how to become a solicitor
](http://www.lawsociety.ie/Public/Become-a-Solicitor/) on the Law Society
website.

If you are a qualified lawyer from outside of Ireland, you can [ convert your
qualifications ](https://www.lawsociety.ie/education--cpd/Become-a-
Solicitor/Foreign-Lawyers) to practice as a solicitor in Ireland.

##  Where to find a solicitor

The Law Society maintains a list of solicitors who hold a practicing
certificate in Ireland. You can search the Law Society website to [ find a
solicitor or firm ](https://www.lawsociety.ie/Find-a-Solicitor/Solicitor-Firm-
Search) .

The Law Society also maintains a list of solicitors who are willing to [ take
legal action against another solicitor
](https://www.lawsociety.ie/public/Complaints-against-solicitors/Negligence-
Panel/?_t_id=1B2M2Y8AsgTpgAmY7PhCfg%3d%3d&_t_q=negligence+panel&_t_tags=language%3aen%2csiteid%3a63dca8c7-aed9-407b-a839-adac8f566da7%2candquerymatch&_t_ip=137.191.252.98&_t_hit.id=EngagedWeb_LawSociety_Web_UI9_Models_Pages_Standard2ColumnPage/_d3bf7e24-0bc9-4973-aabb-c7b84e38b96c_en-
IE&_t_hit.pos=2) .

##  How do I complain about a solicitor?

The Law Society sets down rules and regulations about how solicitors may
conduct their business. Before 7 October 2019, complaints about solicitors
were [ made to the Law Society ](https://www.lawsociety.ie/Public/Complaints-
against-solicitors/) .

Since 7 October 2019, if you have a complaint about inadequate services,
excessive costs or alleged misconduct against solicitors, you can make a
complaint to the [ Legal Services Regulatory Authority (LSRA)
](/en/justice/courts-system/legal-services-regulatory-authority/) .

Complaints about solicitors provided by the [ Legal Aid Board
](/en/justice/legal-aid-and-advice/legal-aid-board/) should be made as per the
[ Legal Aid Board's complaints procedure
](http://www.legalaidboard.ie/en/About-the-Board/Customer-Charter/Complaints-
Procedure/) .
