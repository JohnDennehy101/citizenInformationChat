##  What is the State Pension (Contributory)?

You can get the State Pension (Contributory) from the age of 66 if you have
enough [ social insurance (PRSI) contributions
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-
system/social-insurance-prsi/social-insurance/) . It is sometimes called the
old-age pension.

The State Pension (Contributory) is not means tested. You can get it even if
you have other income, such as an occupational pension.

As the social insurance (PRSI) conditions are very complex, you should apply
for a State Pension (Contributory) if you have ever worked in Ireland and have
paid PRSI contributions (stamps) at any time.

If you [ retire early ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-
welfare/social-welfare-payments/older-and-retired-people/early-retirement/) ,
make sure you continue [ paying PRSI contributions
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-
system/social-insurance-prsi/voluntary-prsi-contributions/) , or that you are
getting [ credited contributions
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-
system/social-insurance-prsi/credited-social-insurance-contributions/) (if you
are eligible). This can help you get a contributory pension when you reach
pension age.

###  Applying for State Pension (Contributory) from 2025

If you apply for your State Pension (Contributory) from 2025, there will be
changes to how your pension is calculated. Read 'Changes to the State Pension
(Contributory) 2025' below.

##  What age can I get a State Pension (Contributory)?

You must be at least 66 to qualify for a State pension.

You can choose to [ defer claiming your State Pension (Contributory) up to age
70 ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/social-welfare-
payments/older-and-retired-people/deferring-your-state-pension-contributory/)
.

###  **Retiring early**

If you retire at 65, you may qualify for a [ benefit payment until you reach
66 ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/social-welfare-
payments/older-and-retired-people/payment-for-people-retired-at-65/) .

You can also read our pages about [ early retirement
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/older-and-retired-
people/early-retirement/) , and [ retiring from work
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/employment/retirement/retiring-from-
work/) .

##  How to qualify for a State Pension (Contributory)

To qualify for a State Pension (Contributory), you must be aged 66 or over,
and have enough Class A, E, F, G, H, N, or S [ social insurance contributions
(PRSI) ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/irish-social-
welfare-system/social-insurance-prsi/social-insurance-classes/) . These are
also called full-rate PRSI contributions.

You must meet 3 conditions, including:

###  **1\. You have paid PRSI contributions before a certain age**

To get a State Pension (Contributory) at 66, you must have started paying PRSI
before the age of 56. If you are [ deferring your pension ](/en/social-
welfare/older-and-retired-people/deferring-your-state-pension-contributory/) ,
you must have started paying PRSI at least 10 years before you drawdown your
pension.

####  **Entry into insurance**

The date you first started paying PRSI is called your date of ‘entry into
insurance’. Your date of entry into insurance is also important when you
calculate your yearly average number of PRSI contributions – see ‘Yearly
average or total number of contributions’ below.

Your ‘entry into insurance _’_ is the date of the first paid PRSI contribution
made when you started your first job. However, this may not be the case if you
either:

  * Have mixed PRSI contributions 
  * Were self-employed. 

####  **Mixed PRSI**

There are special rules if you have mix of full-rate PRSI contributions and
modified-rate contributions. Modified-rate social insurance contributions are
PRSI contributions at Classes B, C and D (paid by civil and public servants).

If you have mixed PRSI contributions and you paid your first full-rate
employment contribution before 6 April 1991 and before you were 56, your entry
into insurance can be the date you first started paying the full rate of PRSI,
if that would be to your advantage.

If you started to pay full-rate PRSI after 6 April 1991, your entry into
insurance is the date you first paid any social insurance.

####  **Self-employed**

There are special rules on entry into insurance for self-employed people. PRSI
for self-employed people was introduced on 6 April 1988. If you started paying
self-employed PRSI on 6 April 1988 and had previously paid employee PRSI at
any time, then your date of entry into insurance can be either 6 April 1988,
or the date when you first paid employee PRSI, whichever would give you a
higher rate of pension.

If you started paying self-employed PRSI after 6 April 1988, your date of
entry into insurance will be the date your first contribution was paid.

###  **2\. You have a certain number of paid PRSI contributions**

The number of paid PRSI contributions you need for the State Pension
(Contributory) depends on your retirement date.

If you reach pension age **on or after** **6 April 2012** , you need to have
520 full-rate PRSI contributions (10 years’ contributions).

If you reached pension age **between** **6 April 2002 and 5 April 2012** , you
needed to have 260 full-rate contributions (5 years’ contributions).

If you reached pension age **before** **6 April 2002** , you needed 156
qualifying full-rate paid contributions (3 years’ contributions).

####  **Check your social insurance record**

If you have a MyGovID account, you can [ request a copy of your contribution
statement ](https://services.mywelfare.ie/en/topics/statements-refunds-and-
calculators/contribution-statement/) through MyWelfare.ie. To do this, you
need your [ PPS (Personal Public Service) number
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-
system/personal-public-service-number/) .

Your contribution statement shows:

  * How many social insurance contributions you have, up to the end of the last tax year 
  * Any [ credited contributions ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/social-insurance-prsi/credited-social-insurance-contributions/) you have. 

###  **3\. You have a 'yearly average' or total number of contributions**

The DSP will calculate your PRSI contributions differently, depending on
whether you reached pension age before, or after, 1 September 2012.

###  **If you reached pension age before 1 September 2012**

If you reached pension age **before 1 September 2012** , you must have a
yearly average number of PRSI contributions (paid or [ credited contributions
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-
system/social-insurance-prsi/credited-social-insurance-contributions/) ) from
the year you first started paying PRSI, to the end of the tax year before you
reach pension age.

This is probably the most complex aspect of qualifying for a State Pension
(Contributory). There is the ‘normal average rule _’_ and the ‘alternative
average rule’.

####  **Normal average rule**

The normal average rule states that you must have a yearly average of at least
10 qualifying contributions paid or credited, from the year you first entered
insurance, to the end of the tax year before you reach pension age.

You need an average of 10 contributions a year to get a minimum pension, and
you need an average of 48 a year to get the maximum pension.

Your yearly average will be rounded to the nearest number. For example, 9.4 is
rounded down to 9 and 47.5 is rounded up to 48.

####  **Alternative average rule**

The ‘alternative average rule’ says you must have an average of 48 Class A, E,
F, G, H, N or S contributions (paid or credited) for each contribution year.
This rule applies from the 1979-1980 tax year to the end of the tax year
before you reach pension age.

If you have this average of 48 contributions, you are entitled to the maximum
pension. You cannot get a reduced pension when this alternative average is
used.

####  **How your average is assessed**

The DSP assesses your pension application using both the normal average and
the alternative average.

The alternative average will probably be looked at first because it is easier
to assess. Most employed or formerly employed people will be able to meet the
alternative average rule of 48 contributions.

If you do not have an average of 48 contributions from 1979, then the DSP will
assess your application using the normal average rule. You may get a reduced
pension. If you do not meet the alternative average, it is almost impossible
for you to have an average of 48 using the normal average rule.

####  **If you spent time working in the home (caring)**

The DSP can ‘disregard’ (not take into account) up to 20 years spent as a
homemaker when calculating your yearly average. This [ Homemakers’ Scheme
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-
system/social-insurance-prsi/homemakers-scheme/) can only be used when
calculating your yearly average number of contributions. See ‘Carers and the
State Pension (Contributory)’ below.

###  **If you reach pension age on or after 1 September 2012**

If you reach pension age **on or after 1 September 2012** , you can be
assessed using either the average rules (see above) or the [ Total
Contributions Approach ](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/b6193-how-to-
calculate-your-state-pension-contributory-rate/#using-the-total-contributions-
approach) (TCA).

The Total Contributions Approach, also known as the _Aggregated Contributions
Method_ , does not use a yearly average to calculate the rate of pension.
Instead, the rate is based on the total number of contributions you have paid
before you reach the age of 66 or the [ age you defer your pension to
](/en/social-welfare/older-and-retired-people/deferring-your-state-pension-
contributory/) .

Using the TCA, you will qualify for the maximum personal rate of State Pension
(Contributory) if you have 2,080 or more PRSI contributions (or 40 years’ of
employment).

The TCA calculation includes the [ HomeCaring Periods Scheme
](http://homecaring%20periods%20schemehomecaring%20periods%20scheme/) and
Long-Term Carers Contributions, which can help you to either qualify for the
SPC, or get a higher rate. See ‘Carers and the State Pension (Contributory)’
below.

You can also have up to 10 years [ credited contributions ](/en/social-
welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/social-insurance-prsi/credited-social-
insurance-contributions/) used as part of your pension calculation. **However,
your combined HomeCaring Periods and credited contributions cannot total more
than 1,040 (20 years).**

If your combined total of paid contributions, HomeCaring Period and credited
contributions is less than 2,080, you will qualify for a reduced rate of
pension.

For example, a combined total of 1,040 paid contributions, made up of
HomeCaring Period and credited contributions, would entitle you to 50% of the
maximum pension (1,040 / 2,080 = 50%).

##  Carers and the State Pension (Contributory)

If you were a homemaker or took time out of work to care for someone, you may
be entitled to pension caring supports. Depending on your circumstances, you
can use these supports to qualify for a State Pension (Contributory), or to
get a higher rate of State Pension (Contributory).

There are 3 pension caring supports:

  * [ The Homemaker’s Scheme ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/social-insurance-prsi/homemakers-scheme/) (only used when averaging contributions to calculate SPC rate) 
  * [ HomeCaring Periods Scheme ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/social-insurance-prsi/homecaring-periods-scheme/) (used when using TCA to calculate SPC) 
  * [ Long-Term Carers Contributions ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/social-insurance-prsi/long-term-carers-contributions/) (used when using TCA to calculate SPC) 

You can use Long-term Carers Contributions and HomeCaring Periods Scheme
together, as long as the periods of care don’t overlap.

You don’t need to apply for each scheme separately. You only need to fill in
one application form, called the PCS1 form. This form is not available to
download, but you can ask the Pension Caring Supports Section of the DSP to
send you a form by post (see contact details below).

If you have a MyGovID account, you can also [ apply for the pension caring
support schemes online at MyWelfare.ie
](https://services.mywelfare.ie/en/topics/pensions-and-older-people/caring-
periods/) .

###  **I already get a pension, can my weekly rate be reviewed?**

If you are over 66 and already get a pension, but you think you may be
entitled to pension caring supports, you can ask to have your pension
reviewed. See contact details below:

**Yearly average PRSI contributions** |  **Personal rate per week** |  **Increase for a qualified adult (under 66)** |  **Increase for a qualified adult (66 and over)**  
---|---|---|---  
48 or over  |  €277.30  |  €184.70  |  €248.60

**These qualified adult rates apply to claims made from 6 April 2001.

The [ State Pension is taxable ](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-
system/claiming-a-social-welfare-payment/taxation-of-social-welfare-payments/)
, but you are unlikely to pay tax if it is your only income.

###  Adult dependants

You can get an [ increase in your payment for an adult dependant
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-
system/claiming-a-social-welfare-payment/claiming-an-increase-in-your-social-
welfare-payment-for-an-adult-dependant/) (called an increase for qualified
adult or IQA). An adult dependant is your spouse, civil partner or [
cohabitant ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/birth-family-
relationships/cohabiting-couples/rights-of-cohabiting-couples/#e6e823) .

Your income is **not** taken into account in the assessment for an IQA.

The DSP takes any income your adult dependant has from employment, self-
employment, savings, investments and capital (for example, any property except
your own home) into account. If you have joint savings or investments with
your adult dependant, only half is taken into account.

If you are getting a State Pension (Contributory), the IQA is automatically
paid directly to your adult dependant.

###  **Child dependants**

You can also get an [ increase in your payment for child dependants
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-
system/claiming-a-social-welfare-payment/claiming-and-increase-in-your-
payment-for-a-child-dependant/) (known as an Increase for a Qualified Child or
IQC).

However, you cannot get an IQC with your State Pension (Contributory) if your
partner has an income of over €400 a week. You get a half-rate IQC if partner
earns between €310 and €400 a week. This only applies to claims made after 6
July 2012.

###  **Other** **benefits**

You are automatically paid an extra allowance of €10 per week when you turn
80. This increase is not paid to adult dependants.

If you live alone, you may be entitled to the [ Living Alone Increase
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/social-welfare-
payments/extra-social-welfare-benefits/living-alone-allowance/) .

You may also be eligible for other benefits. Read about:

  * [ Medical cards ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/health/medical-cards-and-gp-visit-cards/medical-card/)
  * The [ Household Benefits Package ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/social-welfare-payments/extra-social-welfare-benefits/household-benefits-package/)
  * [ Fuel Allowance ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/social-welfare-payments/extra-social-welfare-benefits/fuel-allowance/)

###  Pro-rata pensions

You can read our page about [ pro-rata pensions ](/en/social-welfare/older-

###  **Brexit and your pension**

On [ 31 January 2020 the UK exited the EU.
](https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2020/01/30/brexit-
council-adopts-decision-to-conclude-the-withdrawal-agreement/) However, you
will still get your Irish State Pension (Contributory) or UK State Pension, as
before. Irish and UK citizens living in Ireland can still benefit from social
insurance contributions made when working in the UK.

###  Pensions Commisson

The [ Pensions Commission ](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/02859-about-the-
pensions-commission/) was set up under the [ Programme for Government 2020
](https://www.finegael.ie/app/uploads/2020/06/ProgrammeforGovernment_Final_16.06.20-1.pdf)
to examine sustainability and eligibility issues with State pensions and the
Social Insurance Fund.

##  Changes to the State Pension (Contributory) 2025

From 1 January 2025, if you were born on or after 1 January 1959, your pension
rate will be calculated using either:

  1. Only the ‘Total Contribution Approach (TCA)' 
  2. A combination of the ‘yearly average method’ and ‘Total Contribution Approach (TCA)’. 

You will get whichever rate is greater.

Read about these methods under ‘How your pension application is assessed’
above.

Over the following 10 years (from 2025 to 2034), the ‘yearly average method’
will be phased out. By 2034, all pensions for people born on or after 1
January 1968, will be calculated using only the TCA.

###  **Table showing how State Pension (Contributory) is calculated using
combination of ‘Yearly Average’ and ‘TCA’**

**The year you draw down your pension** |  **The percentage calculated using 'yearly average'** |  **Plus, the** **percentage calculated using** **Total Contributions Approach (TCA)**  
---|---|---  
2025  |  90%  |  10%   
2026  |  80%  |  20%   
2027  |  70%  |  30%   
2028  |  60%  |  40%   
2029  |  50%  |  50%   
2030  |  40%  |  60%   
2031  |  30%  |  70%   
2032  |  20%  |  80%   
2033  |  10%  |  90%   
2034  |  0%  |  100%   
  
###  **Example of how the rate of SPC is calculated in 2027**

**Example of how someone’s rate of State Pension (Contributory) is calculated
in 2027**  
---  
Mary will be 69 when she applies for her State Pension (Contributory) in 2027.
The Department of Social Protection (DSP) will calculate her rate of pension
using both the:  • Total Contribution Approach, and  • The yearly average
method  
**Step 1:** The DSP checks the total number of Mary’s contributions, using the
TCA.  
**Step 2:** The DSP then calculates Mary’s ‘yearly average’.  If her rate of
pension using the TCA is higher than when using the yearly average, Mary gets
the rate from the TCA calculation.  But, if the yearly average calculation
gives a higher rate, the DSP continues their calculations (see Step 3).  
**Step 3:** In 2027, the DSP will add 70% of the SPC rate Mary will get using
the yearly average, and 30% of her TCA pension rate.  70% (YA) + 30% (TCA) =
Mary’s final SPC rate.  
  
To get a State Pension (Contributory), you must have started paying PRSI **at
least 10 years** before you reach the age of 66 or the [ age you defer your
pension to ](/en/social-welfare/older-and-retired-people/deferring-your-state-
pension-contributory/) .
