##  Introduction

After your baby is born, you and your baby will have medical check-ups. These
are known as postnatal check-ups. Your postnatal check and your baby's 6-week
check can be done by your GP during the same appointment.

There are many [ physical and emotional symptoms you may experience after
giving birth ](https://www2.hse.ie/wellbeing/pregnancy-and-birth/birth/health-
after-birth/body-changes-recovery/) . It is important you allow your body time
to recover.

However, you should contact your GP, midwife or public health nurse if you
feel worried about any of these symptoms or that something is not right.

If your new lifestyle with a young baby is making you feel low, you can [ get
help and support ](/en/birth-family-relationships/after-your-baby-is-
born/supports-for-postnatal-depression/) .

###  Get help in an emergency

If you have any thoughts of harming yourself or your baby, [ contact your GP
](https://www2.hse.ie/services/find-a-gp/) or [ your local GP out-of-hours
service ](https://www2.hse.ie/services/find-a-gp-out-of-hours/) immediately.
**You can also call the emergency services on 112 or 999.**

##  Postnatal check-up for you

If you have had a normal delivery, you will have a [ postnatal check-up
](https://www2.hse.ie/wellbeing/babies-and-children/parenting-advice/health-
mental-wellbeing/postnatal-check-up/) after 6 weeks. This is usually carried
out either by your GP or your obstetrician. Your GP or obstetrician will
discuss any health problems with you. They may also examine your wound if you
had a caesarean section or a tear.

Your postnatal check may also include:

  * Checking your blood pressure, particularly if you had high blood pressure during or after your pregnancy 
  * Weighing you – if your body mass index (BMI) is high, your doctor will give you some advice on ways to reduce this 

You may also want to ask your doctor for advice on [ breastfeeding
](/en/birth-family-relationships/after-your-baby-is-born/breastfeeding/) .

Your GP or obstetrician can advise you on options for contraception. If you
are due a [ cervical screening ](/en/health/health-services/cancer-
services/cervical-screening-programme/) , they may schedule a screening for 3
months after the birth.

##  Protecting your mental health

You may experience emotional symptoms after giving birth. This is quite normal
after having a baby and is sometimes called ‘the baby blues’. You can discuss
your feelings with your doctor during your appointment.

You can also contact your GP, midwife or public health nurse before your
postnatal check-up if you feel worried about your mental health or that
something is not right. [ Postnatal depression
](https://www2.hse.ie/conditions/mental-health/postnatal-depression/postnatal-
depression.html) affects 10 to 15% of women within the first year of giving
birth. Whether you have mild or severe symptoms, there are [ postnatal
supports ](/en/birth-family-relationships/after-your-baby-is-born/supports-
for-postnatal-depression/) available to help.

##  Postnatal check-ups for your baby

Under the [ Maternity and Infant Care Scheme ](/en/health/health-
services/reproductive_health/maternity-and-infant-welfare-services/) (the
scheme that provides free antenatal and postnatal care), your GP will examine:

  * Your baby at 2 weeks, **and**
  * Both mother and baby at 6 weeks 

###  The 2-week check

The visit at 2 weeks is mainly to re-establish contact with your GP and to
check how you and your baby are getting on.

###  The 6-week check

You can either go to your GP or your maternity hospital for the 6-week check.

Your GP or hospital paediatrician will examine your baby to check their
development. They will check your baby's weight, length, head circumference
and hips. They will also discuss your baby's feeding patterns and general
health with you, and allow you to discuss any concerns you might have.

Your public health nurse (PHN) will continue to carry out [ developmental
checks on your child ](https://www2.hse.ie/wellbeing/babies-and-
children/checks-milestones/developmental-checks/overview/) at different
stages:

  * [ 6 months ](https://www2.hse.ie/babies-children/checks-milestones/health-checks/until-6-months/)
  * [ 6 to 11 months ](https://www2.hse.ie/babies-children/checks-milestones/health-checks/6-12-months/)
  * [ 18 to 24 months ](https://www2.hse.ie/babies-children/checks-milestones/health-checks/1-2-years/)
  * [ 3-5 years ](https://www2.hse.ie/babies-children/checks-milestones/health-checks/3-5-years/)

Developmental checks find out if your child is growing properly. They also
check if your child is able to do things that children of the same age are
able to do.

These checks are sometimes called _examinations_ . Your Public Health Nurse
will contact you to arrange a time for each of these appointments when they
are due.

If you or your Public Health Nurse have any concerns they may ask you or your
child to come back for another check, or they might also refer you and your
child to a specialist for further assessment.
