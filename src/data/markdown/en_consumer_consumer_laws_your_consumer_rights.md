##  Introduction

When you buy something in Ireland or the EU, you have strong rights.

The laws are designed to:

  * Make you feel confident when shopping in stores or online 
  * Make sure you have enough information to make informed decisions (based on facts) 
  * Provide redress options if things go wrong 

By law, sellers or suppliers (known as ‘traders’) must treat you fairly, for
example, by making sure products and services are safe and of a high standard.

##  Updates to consumer law

The [ Consumer Rights Act 2022
](https://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2022/act/37/enacted/en/html) became law
on 29 November 2022. It simplified and updated consumer protection laws.

The Act introduced new protections, including:

  * Rights for [ digital content contracts ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/consumer/buying-digital-content-and-services/your-rights-when-you-buy-digital-content-or-services/)
  * Rights for [ services contracts ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/consumer/buying-services/your-rights-when-buying-services/)
  * A right to agree a price reduction on faulty products or services 
  * A ‘blacklist’ of [ contract terms ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/consumer/consumer-laws/terms-and-conditions/) that are always unfair 
  * A ban on certain [ aggressive commercial practices ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/consumer/advertising-and-promotions/unfair-sales-practices/) , including fake reviews 

Extra enforcement powers for the Competition and Consumer Protection
Commission (CCPC) You can read more about the [ Consumer Rights Act
](https://www.ccpc.ie/business/ccpc-welcomes-new-rights-for-consumers/) on the
CCPC website.

##  Who are consumers?

Consumer laws only apply to transactions between a _consumer_ and a _trader._

A consumer buys goods or services for personal use.

A trader sells goods or services as a business, trade or profession.

Consumer law does not apply when buying from:

  * A private individual who is not a trader (for example, someone selling you their car but who does not sell cars as a profession). 
  * A seller outside the EU or _European Economic Area_ (Norway, Iceland, and Liechtenstein). 

##  Types of consumer contracts

When you buy goods, services and digital content, you make a contract with the
seller. As parties to the agreement, both you and the seller have certain
legal rights and obligations.

The main types of consumer contracts are:

  * [ Sales contracts ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/consumer/shopping/rights-when-buying-in-a-shop/) and [ online sales contracts ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/consumer/shopping/shopping-online/)
  * [ Contracts for services ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/consumer/buying-services/)
  * [ Digital content services or contracts ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/consumer/buying-digital-content-and-services/)

Contracts can be made verbally, in writing, or by your conduct (for example, a
silent contract where you pay for a good at a self-service supermarket
checkout).

Certain terms can be set by the businesses (for example the price or how a
service is carried out). However, these terms must not go against your
consumer rights.

##  What you can expect from your product or service

When you buy products, services or digital content or services they must be ‘
_in conformity with the contract_ ’. They must meet certain conditions of
quality, performance and durability.

You are entitled to certain remedies, when something you buy does not meet the
conditions or standards. A remedy could be a [ repair, replacement, refund
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/consumer/shopping/problems-with-
faulty-goods/) or a price reduction.

Read more about the standards and conditions you can expect when you [ buy in
a shop ](/en/consumer/shopping/rights-when-buying-in-a-shop/) , [ buy online
](/en/consumer/shopping/shopping-online/) , [ buy a service
](/en/consumer/buying-services/) or [ buy digital content
](/en/consumer/buying-digital-content-and-services/) .

##  Right to information

Consumer law gives you a right to certain information before you buy.

The information you must get depends on whether you bought in a physical shop,
online or on your doorstep.

When you buy [ online ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/consumer/buying-
digital-content-and-services/) or at your [ doorstep
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/consumer/shopping/buying-from-a-
doorstep-seller/) , you must get a copy of the signed contract or order
confirmation. The confirmation should be on paper or through email.

**Key information you must get** |  **Where you bought**  
---|---  
**In store** |  **At your door** |  **Online**  
Seller’s business name, address, phone number  |  Y  |  Y  |  Y   
Seller’s email, other communication channels  |  N  |  Y  |  Y   
Product or service details  |  Y  |  Y  |  Y

Your right to cancel, where it applies  |  Y  |  Y  |  Y   
Conditions applying to deposits (if relevant)  |  N  |  Y  |  Y   
  
##  Right to change your mind and cancel

You have a right to change your mind and cancel when you buy online, over the
phone, by mail order or on your doorstep (known as _distance contracts_ ).

With distance contracts, you do not enter into the contract in person and you
cannot check the products or service before you buy. For this reason, you have
a ‘ _cooling off period_ ’ where you can change your mind and get a refund.

The cooling off period ends 14 days after you receive the goods or service.
For [ doorstep sales
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/consumer/shopping/buying-from-a-
doorstep-seller/) , you have 30 days from when the contract was agreed to
cancel.

Sometimes you do not have a cooling-off period and the seller must tell you
this before you buy. Read more about [ shopping online
](/en/consumer/shopping/shopping-online/) .

The European Consumer Centre Ireland has a useful [ letter template for
returning products bought online within the cancellation period
](https://www.eccireland.ie/letter/returning-products/) .

##  Unfair terms

Contract [ terms and conditions
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/consumer/consumer-laws/terms-and-
conditions/) must be fair and clear. A term is unfair if you are at an unfair
disadvantage.

Consumer law sets out terms that **may be unfair** (the ‘ **grey list** ’) and
ones that are **always and automatically unfair** (the ‘ **blacklist** ’).

There are legal tests of the transparency and fairness of contract terms. It
is up to the seller to prove that terms are transparent and fair.

##  Unfair sales practices

You are protected against unfair, misleading or aggressive sales practices.

Sellers cannot:

  * Make a false or misleading claim about products, services, and prices 
  * Use false or misleading descriptions 
  * Use aggressive tactics to influence you 
  * Present reviews as genuine without checking they are not fake 

There are 36 sales practices that are always banned (prohibited). Read more
about [ unfair sales practices.
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/consumer/advertising-and-
promotions/unfair-sales-practices/)

##  If things go wrong

If something you bought is faulty or does not meet the description, the seller
must offer you a repair, replacement, refund or a reduction in the price.

Find out more about [ faulty products ](/en/consumer/shopping/problems-with-
faulty-goods/) , [ problem with a service ](/en/consumer/buying-
services/problem-with-a-service/) or [ problem with digital content or
services ](/en/consumer/buying-digital-content-and-services/problem-with-
digital-content-or-service/) .

###  Make a complaint

Always approach the seller first, to allow them to put things right.

You can get more advice about [ how to complain. ](/en/consumer/how-to-
complain/how-to-make-a-complaint/)

###  Take your complaint further

If your complaint is not resolved, you can get help and advice from an
independent [ consumer protection organisation
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/consumer/how-to-complain/consumer-
protection-organisations/) .

The [ Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC)
](https://www.ccpc.ie/) has a consumer helpline and website that gives
consumers information on their rights.

If the business is registered in another EU country, Iceland, Norway or the UK
you can [ submit a complaint to the European Consumer Centre Ireland
](https://www.eccireland.ie/submit-a-complaint/) .

Read more about [ taking your complaint further
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/consumer/how-to-complain/how-to-make-
a-complaint/#2e68ba) .

##  Breaches of consumer law

The [ Consumer Rights Act 2022
](https://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2022/act/37/enacted/en/html) strengthens
the enforcement powers of consumer protection agencies like the Competition
and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC) and the Commission for
Communications Regulation (ComReg).

The CCPC can take action against traders who do not give you the remedies or
refunds you are entitled to or who use misleading or aggressive practices.

Companies can be fined by the Courts following enforcement action taken by the
CCPC.
