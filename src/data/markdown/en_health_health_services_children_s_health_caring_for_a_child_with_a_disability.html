##  Introduction

Disability can be diagnosed at any stage during a child’s development. A child
may be found to have a disability before birth or around the time of birth.
Sometimes a disability may not become apparent until later in your child's
life when they have difficulty learning in school. In some cases children
acquire a disability after an illness or accident.

When your child is diagnosed with a disability, it can be an emotional time.
The HSE has [ advice for parents and guardians
](https://www2.hse.ie/services/disability-support-and-services/if-you-have-
just-found-out-your-child-has-a-disability/if-you-have-just-found-out-your-
child-has-a-disability.html) who get this news.

You and your child are entitled to the same services and benefits as all other
families living in Ireland.

This page outlines services, supports and payments for children living with a
disability. They apply whether your child was born with a disability or
acquired it later.

The Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth has
also published a [ directory of services and supports available for children
with additional needs. ](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/65c97-supports-for-
parents-with-children-with-additional-needs/)

If your child is 18 or over, the [ Guide to entitlements for people with
disabilities 2022 (pdf)
](https://www.citizensinformationboard.ie/downloads/guides/guide_to_entitlements_for_people_with_disabilities_2022.pdf)
has detailed information for adults with disabilities and their carers.

##  If you are worried about your child's development

Your GP does free [ developmental examinations ](/en/health/health-
services/reproductive_health/maternity-and-infant-welfare-services/) in the
weeks following your baby’s birth. Your [ public health nurse ](/en/birth-
family-relationships/after-your-baby-is-born/maternity-care-and-public-health-
nurse/) also monitors the development of your baby in their early weeks,
months and years and provides information and support to parents.

Some children develop more slowly than other children. If [ you think that
your child is not developing as they should
](https://www2.hse.ie/services/disability-support-and-services/if-you-are-
worried-your-child-might-have-a-disability.html) , make an appointment with
your GP or public health nurse as soon as possible.

Often there is nothing to be worried about, and many children catch up in
their own time. If the GP or public health nurse is concerned, they can refer
you to the service your child needs.

##  Getting a referral

Children who have mild or moderate difficulties may be referred to health
professionals in their local primary care services. You can find out about
these services at your [ Local Health Centre
](https://www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/2/healthcentres/) .

These services can include:

  * Speech and language therapy 
  * Physiotherapy 
  * Occupational therapy 

###  Education

If your child is having difficulties in school, you should speak to their
teacher or school principal. They will advise you on what to do next. This may
include an [ educational assessment ](/en/education/primary-and-post-primary-
education/educational-supports/psychological-assessment-school/) . Formal
educational assessment of school-going children is generally carried out by
the [ National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS)
](https://www.gov.ie/en/service/5ef45c-neps/) . You can arrange a private
assessment if NEPS psychologists are not available. Some parents choose
private assessments. If your school arranges an assessment through NEPS, there
is no charge for the assessment.

##  Children’s Disability Network Teams

Children with a range of significant difficulties may be referred to a [
Children’s Disability Network Team ](https://www2.hse.ie/services/disability-
support-and-services/childrens-disability-services/childrens-disability-
services.html) . This is a team of professionals with expertise in disability
who work closely together. Other specialists may also be available to the team
if needed.

Children’s Disability Network Teams provide services to children with complex
needs aged from birth to 18 years. (Previously, some of these services were
known as Early Intervention Services and School Age Services.)

The team will assess and identify your child’s needs and, together with you,
develop a plan of action for providing services. This plan may include
individual and group therapy and supports for families.

Children’s Disability Network Teams are led by the HSE or by disability
organisations such as [ Enable Ireland ](https://www.enableireland.ie/) , [ St
Michael’s House ](https://www.smh.ie/) or the [ Brothers of Charity
](https://www.brothersofcharity.ie/) . The HSE has published information on
the [ Children’s Disability Network Teams (pdf)
](https://www.enableireland.ie/sites/default/files/publication/Childrens%20Disability%20Network%20Teams%20Leaflet.pdf)
and how they work.

A Children’s Disability Network Team may include:

  * Psychologists 
  * Nurses 
  * Occupational therapists 
  * Paediatricians (doctors specialising in the medical care of children) 
  * Physiotherapists 
  * Social workers 
  * Speech and language therapists 
  * Other professionals 

Information about [ Children’s Disability Network Teams is available in
different languages ](https://www2.hse.ie/services/disability-support-and-
services/childrens-disability-services/translated-children-s-disability-
network-information.html) .

Your child may be referred to a Children’s Disability Network Team through
your paediatrician, GP, public health nurse or school.

You can also make a referral directly yourself to the [ Children’s Disability
Network Team in your area ](https://www2.hse.ie/services/disability-support-
and-services/childrens-disability-services/find-a-childrens-disability-
service.html) by filling in:

  * The Children’s Services Referral Form 
  * An Additional Information Form for your child’s age group. This gives you an opportunity to describe your child’s development and what your concerns are. 

You can get the [ Children Services Referral Form and the Additional
Information Form on the HSE website ](https://www2.hse.ie/services/disability-
support-and-services/childrens-disability-services/get-a-referral-for-
childrens-disability-services.html) .

Send the forms to the [ Children's Disability Network Team for your area
](https://www2.hse.ie/services/disability-support-and-services/childrens-
disability-services/find-a-childrens-disability-service.html) .

Health professionals will review the information you provide in the forms to
help decide the best service for your child. Unfortunately, there is often a
waiting list for these services. While you wait, you can [ contact
organisations who will provide you with information, advice and support
](https://www2.hse.ie/services/disability-support-and-services/if-you-have-
just-found-out-your-child-has-a-disability/useful-childhood-disability-
websites.html) .

##  Applying for an Assessment of Need

If your child has a disability or you think they may have a disability, you
can apply to an Assessment Officer for an [ Assessment of Need
](/en/health/health-services/health-services-for-people-with-
disabilities/assessment-of-need-for-people-with-disabilites/) . This
identifies your child's health and education needs.

Everyone born on or after 1 June 2002 who has, or may have a disability has a
right to an assessment.

After the assessment, you will get a report and a statement of the services
that will be provided for your child.

**Your child does not need an Assessment of Need to access health services.
You can apply directly to services.**

You can read more about the [ Assessment of Need
](https://www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/4/disability/disability-assessment/)
and how to apply for one on the HSE’s website.

###  Other health services for children with disabilities

Your child may be eligible for a [ medical card ](/en/health/medical-cards-
and-gp-visit-cards/medical-card/) or [ GP visit card ](/en/health/medical-
cards-and-gp-visit-cards/gp-visit-cards/) depending on your circumstances. If
you are getting [ Domiciliary Care Allowance ](/en/social-welfare/disability-
and-illness/domiciliary-care-allowance/) for your child, your child is
eligible for a medical card without a means test.

If your child has a condition that is covered by the [ Long Term Illness
Scheme ](/en/health/drugs-and-medicines/long-term-illness-scheme/) , you can
get free medicines and appliances for the treatment of that condition.

##  Education supports

###  Early-years

Pre-school children with disabilities can generally attend mainstream pre-
schools. All children are entitled to two year’s free pre-school education and
early childhood care under the [ Early Childhood Care and Education Scheme
](/en/education/pre-school-education-and-childcare/early-childhood-care-and-
education-scheme/) . Some specialised pre-school services may be available in
your area and many pre-schools have staff who are trained to work with
children with special needs.

Children with a disability are entitled to an [ Assessment of Need
](/en/health/health-services/health-services-for-people-with-
disabilities/assessment-of-need-for-people-with-disabilites/) of education
supports and services (see above).

###  Primary and secondary school

[ Special needs education ](/en/education/special-education-needs/special-
education/) provides supports to help children with disabilities in [ primary
education ](/en/education/special-education-needs/special-needs-education-
primary-schools/) and [ post-primary education ](/en/education/special-
education-needs/post-primary-education-for-students-with-special-needs/) .

[ Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs) ](https://ncse.ie/seno-contact-
information) are responsible for allocating additional teaching and other
resources such as [ assistive technology ](/en/education/primary-and-post-
primary-education/educational-supports/assistive-technology-grant-students-
with-disabilities/) at local level.

Many areas have [ school transport for children with special needs
](/en/education/special-education-needs/school-transport-for-children-with-
special-needs/) .

The [ Visiting Teacher Service ](/en/education/primary-and-post-primary-
education/educational-supports/visiting-teacher-service/) supports children
who are deaf/hard of hearing or blind/visually impaired and their parents and
families. The [ Summer Provision education programme ](/en/education/special-
education-needs/summer-education-programme/) provides additional educational
supports during the summer to children with complex special needs.

###  Third-level education

There are also [ supports for third-level students with a disability
](/en/education/third-level-education/applying-to-college/third-level-
admissions-scheme-for-students-with-disabilities/) . All third-level colleges
have a disability or access office which is responsible for providing support
and advice to students with disabilities. The [ DARE admissions scheme for
students with disabilities ](/en/education/third-level-education/applying-to-
college/third-level-admissions-scheme-for-students-with-disabilities/) is a
third-level alternative admissions scheme for school leavers whose
disabilities have had a negative impact on their second-level education.

##  Income supports

The Department of Social Protection provides the main [ income supports and
payments for carers and people with disabilities ](/en/social-
welfare/carers/payments-to-carers/) .

###  Carers

The [ Domiciliary Care Allowance ](/en/social-welfare/disability-and-
illness/domiciliary-care-allowance/) is a monthly payment made to the carer of
a child with a severe disability who lives at home. All children getting
Domiciliary Care Allowance are eligible for a [ medical card
](/en/health/medical-cards-and-gp-visit-cards/medical-card/) without a means
test.

The main social welfare payments for full-time carers are [ Carer's Allowance
](/en/social-welfare/carers/carers-allowance/) and [ Carer's Benefit
](/en/social-welfare/carers/carers-benefit/) . You may also qualify for an
annual [ Carer's Support Grant ](/en/social-welfare/carers/carers-support-
grant/) . If you get Carer's Allowance, you are entitled to a [ Free Travel
Pass ](/en/social-welfare/extra-social-welfare-benefits/free-travel/) .

If you get other social welfare payments, you may be able to keep your main
social welfare payment and get [ half-rate Carer's Allowance ](/en/social-
welfare/carers/half-rate-carers-allowance/) as well.

###  When your child reaches 16

When your child reaches the age of 16, they may qualify for [ Disability
Allowance ](/en/social-welfare/disability-and-illness/disability-allowance/) .
If your child takes up employment, it may affect their Disability Allowance.
For more information about this, see our page on [ disability payments and
work ](/en/social-welfare/social-welfare-payments-and-work/disability-
payments-and-work/) .

If your child is getting Disability Allowance, but is not capable of managing
money, the Department of Social Protection may [ appoint you as an agent
](/en/health/legal-matters-and-health/legal-arrangements-for-incapacity/) to
collect your child’s payment and act on their behalf. The money belongs to
your child and you must use it for their benefit. If your child has
substantial money or assets, they may be made a [ Ward of Court
](/en/health/legal-matters-and-health/wards-of-court/) .

If your child is blind or visually impaired, they should apply for the [ Blind
Pension ](/en/social-welfare/disability-and-illness/blind-persons-pension/)
four months before their 18th birthday.

##  Tax credits and reliefs

There are a number of [ tax credits and reliefs that can help with the cost of
disability
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/money_and_tax/tax/tax_credits_and_reliefs_for_people_with_disabilities/)
.

###  Tax credits

The [ Incapacitated Child Tax Credit ](/en/money-and-tax/tax/tax-credits-and-
reliefs-for-people-with-disabilities/incapacitated-child-tax-credit/) is
available to the parents or guardians of children who are permanently
incapacitated. If you have more than one child who is permanently
incapacitated, you can claim a credit for each child.

If you are married or in a civil partnership and you are jointly assessed for
tax, you can claim the [ Home Carer Tax Credit ](/en/money-and-tax/tax/income-
tax-credits-and-reliefs/home-carers-tax-credit/) if you work in the home
caring for a dependent child who is getting [ Child Benefit ](/en/social-
welfare/families-and-children/child-benefit/) .

###  Medical expenses and mobility aids

[ Tax relief on medical expenses ](/en/money-and-tax/tax/income-tax-credits-
and-reliefs/taxation-and-medical-expenses/) is available on the cost of
certain medical expenses such as doctors or consultants visits, physiotherapy
or educational psychological assessments.

You can claim a refund on [ VAT paid for certain aids, appliances and housing
adaptations ](/en/money-and-tax/tax/tax-credits-and-reliefs-for-people-with-
disabilities/vat-refunds-on-aids-and-appliances-used-by-people-with-
disabilities/) needed for your child, for example, a communication aid
designed for a child unable to speak or a special support chair. The relief is
not allowed on services or when renting aids.

###  Disabled drivers and passengers

Under the [ Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers Scheme ](/en/travel-and-
recreation/transport-and-disability/tax-relief-for-disabled-drivers-and-
disabled-passengers/) , tax relief is available for drivers and passengers
with a severe and permanent disability to help with the costs of buying and
running a specially constructed or adapted vehicle.

The scheme also provides:

  * An exemption from the payment of motor tax 
  * An exemption from toll road fees 
  * A fuel grant 

##  Adapting your home

You may qualify for the [ Housing Adaptation Grant for people with a
disability ](/en/housing/housing-grants-and-schemes/housing-supports-for-
older-people-and-people-with-disabilities/housing-adaptation-grant-for-people-
with-disability/) if you need to adapt your home to make it more suitable for
a child with a disability.

Adaptations might include:

  * Adding an extra room 
  * Making the house wheelchair accessible 
  * Putting in a ground-floor bathroom and toilet. 

An occupational therapist's assessment may be required. If you only require
minor work, you can apply for the [ Mobility Aids Grant Scheme
](/en/housing/housing-grants-and-schemes/housing-supports-for-older-people-
and-people-with-disabilities/mobility-aids-grant-scheme/) instead.

##  Planning for the future

Some parents choose to make extra financial provision for their child with a
disability through a will, trust or other arrangement. Although a child with a
disability may be maintained by their parents after the age of 18, this does
not provide them with any special entitlement to provision in a parent’s will.

If you want to make specific provision for your child, get advice from a [
solicitor ](/en/justice/courtroom/solicitors/) or other legal professional.
You may also want to discuss the tax implications with an accountant and
Revenue.

###  Options to protect your child’s future financial well-being

**Deed of covenant:** You may use a [ deed of covenant ](/en/money-and-
tax/tax/income-tax-credits-and-reliefs/deeds-of-covenant/) as a tax-efficient
way to give money to a child aged over 18, but this could affect the child’s
entitlement to [ Disability Allowance ](/en/social-welfare/disability-and-
illness/disability-allowance/) .

**A trust:** Another option is [ a trust ](/en/money-and-tax/tax/tax-credits-
and-reliefs-for-people-with-disabilities/trust-funds-for-permanently-
incapacitated-people/) from which your child may benefit after your death.
Many parents use discretionary trusts to provide for a child with a disability
without affecting entitlement to benefits.

**Appoint a guardian:** You may [ appoint a guardian in your will ](/en/birth-
family-relationships/cohabiting-couples/legal-guardianship-and-unmarried-
couples#l065f5) . This only applies if your child is under 18 when the will
comes into effect. It is not possible to appoint a guardian for an adult
child.

**An occupational pension:** Most public sector [ occupational pension schemes
](/en/money-and-tax/personal-finance/pensions/occupational-pensions/) , and
some private sector schemes, have provisions that allow for the pension
arrangements for permanently incapacitated dependent children to continue for
the child’s lifetime. Check your pension policy to see if this applies in your
case.

##  Enforcing your child’s rights

If you are unhappy about the service you or your child has received, you can
complain to the relevant body.

  * [ Complain about a health service ](/en/health/health-system/making-a-complaint-about-the-health-service-executive/)
  * [ Complain about social welfare ](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/social-welfare-appeals/)
  * [ Complain to the Ombudsman under the Disability Act ](https://www.ombudsman.ie/disability-act/make-a-complaint/)

If you are not satisfied with the outcome of an appeal, contact the [ Office
of the Ombudsman ](/en/government-in-ireland/how-government-works/standards-
and-accountability/office-of-the-ombudsman/) or the [ Ombudsman for Children
](/en/birth-family-relationships/children-s-rights-and-policy/the-ombudsman-
for-children/) which can investigate complaints about certain public services.

##  Where to get help

Children's disability services are for children and young people up to 18
years. The majority of these services are provided by voluntary agencies,
funded by the HSE. Other services are provided directly by the HSE.

###  Primary care services

Your child's needs may be met by [ primary care services
](https://www2.hse.ie/services/disability-support-and-services/childrens-
disability-services/get-a-referral-for-childrens-disability-services.html) at
your Local Health Centre. For example, if they have a speech delay, your local
speech and language therapist can often help.

###  Children’s Disability Network Team

Children who have a range of significant difficulties may need a [ Children’s
Disability Network Team ](https://www2.hse.ie/services/disability-support-and-
services/childrens-disability-services/childrens-disability-services.html) .
Your local Children’s Disability Network Team will include health and social
care professionals, experienced in delivering services for children with
disabilities. Each team member offers expertise in a particular aspect of
child development.

###  Voluntary organisations and agencies

Many of the supports and services for people with disabilities are provided by
disability organisations, funded by the HSE. A wide range of [ national and
local organisations provide information, support and services
](https://www2.hse.ie/services/disability-support-and-services/if-you-have-
just-found-out-your-child-has-a-disability/useful-childhood-disability-
websites.html) independently and on behalf of the HSE.

Children in Hospital Ireland has information to help families [ prepare for
their child having inpatient or outpatient hospital care
](https://informationhub.childreninhospital.ie/) .
