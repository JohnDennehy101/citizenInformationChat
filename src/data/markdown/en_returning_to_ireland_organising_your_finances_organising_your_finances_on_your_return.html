##  Introduction

This page aims to help you organise your finances when you return to Ireland.
It has information on opening a bank account, tax, insurance, social welfare,
borrowing money, the cost of living in Ireland, social welfare and social
insurance.

##  Opening a bank account in Ireland

To [ open a bank account ](/en/money-and-tax/personal-finance/banking/opening-
a-bank-account/) in Ireland, you need to show evidence of your identity and
verify your address. Read about the [ documents you can use ](/en/money-and-
tax/personal-finance/banking/financial-institutions-and-identification#l1f4da)
to do this.

Once you have opened a bank account in Ireland, you can transfer money to
other bank accounts. Another way to transfer money is with private financial
services companies. Before using their services, check if they are [
registered with the Central Bank of Ireland
](http://registers.centralbank.ie/DownloadsPage.aspx) .

If you already have a bank account, but your circumstances have changed, or
you want a better deal, you may want to [ switch your account ](/en/money-and-
tax/personal-finance/banking/switching-your-bank-account/) to another
provider.

##  Tax residence and domicile

Your [ tax residence and domicile ](/en/money-and-tax/tax/moving-country-and-
taxation/tax-residence-and-domicile-in-ireland/) are taken into account for a
number of taxes in Ireland.

Your tax residence depends on the amount of days you spend in Ireland in a tax
year. Staying for 183 days or more in Ireland in the tax year automatically
makes you a tax resident of Ireland. If you return to Ireland and plan on
staying permanently, Ireland is your domicile (home) for tax purposes.

If you are resident and domiciled in Ireland for tax purposes, you must pay
tax in Ireland on all of your income, including income from abroad. However,
If your income is taxable in Ireland and in a country with which Ireland has a
double taxation agreement, you do not pay tax in both countries on the same
income. See ‘Double taxation agreement’ below.

Some taxes you may have to pay in Ireland include:

  * [ Income tax ](/en/money-and-tax/tax/income-tax/how-your-tax-is-calculated/)
  * [ Deposit Interest Retention Tax (DIRT) ](/en/money-and-tax/tax/tax-on-savings-and-investments/deposit-interest-retention-tax/)
  * [ Gift tax ](/en/money-and-tax/tax/capital-taxes/capital-acquisitions-tax/)
  * [ Inheritance tax ](/en/money-and-tax/tax/capital-taxes/capital-acquisitions-tax/)
  * [ Capital Gains Tax ](/en/money-and-tax/tax/capital-taxes/capital-gains-tax/)

Revenue has a guide to [ tax residence ](https://www.revenue.ie/en/jobs-and-
pensions/tax-residence/index.aspx) .

###  Tax reliefs

You may also be eligible for [ income tax credits and tax reliefs ](/en/money-
and-tax/tax/income-tax-credits-and-reliefs/introduction-to-income-tax-credits-
and-reliefs/) .

###  Split-year treatment when you return to Ireland

If you are going to be resident in Ireland for the next calendar year, you can
request split-year treatment the year you arrive.

Split-year treatment means that you are treated as resident in Ireland from
the date you arrive. This means all your employment income from that date is
taxed in Ireland in the normal way. Any employment income earned outside
Ireland before this date is not taxable in Ireland.

If you apply for split-year relief, you can claim the full year’s tax
allowances, credits and rate bands in the same way as an Irish resident, even
though you are only liable for Irish tax from the date you become resident in
Ireland.

Split-year treatment applies to employment income only.

You can apply for split-year treatment in writing:

  * Through MyEnquiries in [ myAccount on the Revenue website ](https://www.ros.ie/myaccount-web/sign_in.html?execution=e2s1&lang=en) , or 
  * To your local [ Revenue office ](https://www.revenue.ie/en/contact-us/index.aspx)

You cannot get split-year treatment if you have lived abroad for less than a
complete tax year before coming back to Ireland.

###  Double taxation agreement

Ireland has a number of [ double taxation agreements ](/en/moving-
country/working-in-ireland/migrant-workers/coming-to-ie-tax#l01933) with other
countries. If your income is taxable in Ireland and in a country with which
Ireland has a double taxation agreement, you do not pay tax in both countries
on the same income.

##  Do I have to pay tax if I transfer my savings to Ireland?

If you have savings from income you earned abroad when you were **non-tax
resident** in Ireland, you can transfer these savings to Ireland without
having to pay Irish tax. If you were tax resident in Ireland when you earned
your foreign income, you may have to pay tax if you transfer these savings to
Ireland.

####  Irish domicile levy

You may have to pay a [ domicile levy ](/en/money-and-tax/tax/moving-country-
and-taxation/tax-residence-and-domicile-in-ireland/) if:

  * You are Irish domiciled 
  * Your worldwide income in the year exceeds €1m 
  * You have Irish property with a value greater than €5m, and 
  * Your Irish income tax for the year is less than €200,000 

##  Transfer social insurance and benefits from abroad

Before you return to Ireland, check if there are any benefits in your current
country of residence which you can [ transfer to Ireland when you move
](/en/moving-country/moving-to-ireland/introduction-to-the-irish-
system/moving-to-ireland-and-your-social-security-entitlements/) .

You may be able to [ combine your insurance records from Ireland and another
country ](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/claiming-a-social-
welfare-payment/social-insurance-contributions-from-abroad/) to qualify for a
pension or social insurance payment in Ireland.

##  Can I transfer my pension to Ireland?

###  EU countries

If you have worked in Ireland and in one or more EU countries, your social
insurance contributions from each EU country may be added to your Irish social
insurance contributions to [ help you qualify for the Irish State pension
](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/claiming-a-social-welfare-
payment/social-insurance-contributions-from-abroad/) .

###  Bilateral agreements

If you have returned from a country with which Ireland has a [ bilateral
social security agreement ](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-
system/claiming-a-social-welfare-payment/social-insurance-contributions-from-
abroad/) , for example the USA, your pension rights from the other country are
protected when you move to Ireland. It is possible to have a State pension
from Ireland and another country.

###  Private pensions

If you return to Ireland and want to transfer your private pension to Ireland
from abroad, you can transfer to an [ approved occupational pension scheme
](https://www.pensionsauthority.ie/en/lifecycle/private_pensions/private_sector_occupational_pension_schemes/)
, [ Personal Retirement Savings Account (PRSA)
](https://www.pensionsauthority.ie/en/lifecycle/private_pensions/personal_retirement_savings_accounts/)
or [ Buy-out bond (BOB)
](https://www.pensionsauthority.ie/en/lifecycle/benefits_payable_on_leaving/transfers_of_benefit/)
.

Your foreign pension must meet [ certain criteria to qualify
](https://www.gov.ie/en/service/9ee188-transfer-of-private-pensions-to-
ireland-for-returning-irish-emigrant/) . You should contact the pension
administrator in the country where you have pension savings.

###  UK

You can transfer your UK state pension to Ireland if you have paid enough UK
National Insurance contributions. You can check your [ UK National Insurance
record online ](https://www.gov.uk/check-national-insurance-record) .

####  UK pension deadline

If you have worked in the UK and have gaps in your National Insurance record,
you can pay voluntary contributions to help you qualify for the [ UK state
pension ](https://www.gov.uk/state-pension) . You have until **5 April 2025**
to pay voluntary contributions to make up for gaps since 2006. After 5 April
2025 , you will only be able to pay contributions to cover the previous 6
years.

##  Buying insurance in Ireland

Insurance can help protect your personal property and your health against
unexpected costs. The Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC)
explain how [ different types of insurance work
](https://www.ccpc.ie/consumers/money/insurance/) .

You should shop around before choosing an insurance provider. Use the [ Health
Insurance Authority's online comparison tool ](https://www.hia.ie/comparison-
tool/#/) to compare private health insurance in Ireland.

Read about [ buying private health insurance when you return to Ireland
](/en/returning-to-ireland/looking-after-your-health/returning-to-ireland-and-
buying-private-health-insurance/) .

**Car insurance**

If you plan on driving in Ireland, you will need car insurance. If you have
been abroad for less than 2 years, your no claims discount will still apply.

Depending on the country you are coming from, insurers may take your [ driving
history
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/returning_to_ireland/getting_around_in_ireland/Getting_motor_insurance_on_return_to_Ireland.html#lbc52a)
in another country into consideration. For more information, see [ getting
motor insurance when you return to Ireland
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/returning_to_ireland/getting_around_in_ireland/Getting_motor_insurance_on_return_to_Ireland.html)
.

##  Borrowing money

When you return home, you may need to [ borrow money ](/en/money-and-
tax/personal-finance/loans-and-credit/borrowing-money-in-ireland/) . Before
you do, make sure you are dealing with a lender that is [ authorised by the
Central Bank ](http://registers.centralbank.ie/) .

If you plan on buying a home in Ireland, you should read about [ taking out a
mortgage ](/en/housing/owning-a-home/help-with-buying-a-home/taking-out-a-
mortgage/) and all the [ steps involved ](/en/housing/owning-a-home/buying-a-
home/steps-involved-buying-a-home/) .

Whether you’re applying for a loan or a mortgage, your [ credit history
](/en/money-and-tax/personal-finance/loans-and-credit/your-credit-history/)
will be taken into consideration by the lender. If you’re returning to Ireland
from abroad, make sure to bring all relevant financial documentation home with
you.

##  The cost of living in Ireland

You may find that the cost of living in Ireland has gone up when you return.
When making the decision to return to Ireland, it can be useful to compare the
cost of living in Ireland with the country you are coming from to help
organise your finances for when you return. Read about the supports available
to [ help you with the cost of living in Ireland
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/money_and_tax/cost_of_living/) .

##  Social welfare

If you need financial support when you return to Ireland, you can apply for a
[ social welfare payment ](/en/returning-to-ireland/applying-for-social-
welfare/accessing-social-welfare-as-a-returning-Irish-emigrant/) . You need to
be [ habitually resident ](/en/returning-to-ireland/applying-for-social-
welfare/habitual-residence-condition/) to be eligible for some social welfare
payments. You may also need to satisfy a means test.

If you have children, you may be able to get [ Child Benefit ](/en/social-
welfare/families-and-children/child-benefit/) .
