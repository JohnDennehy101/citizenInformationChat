##  Introduction

Ireland is a sovereign, independent country and has rules and laws about who
is entitled to Irish citizenship.

Most Irish citizens were automatically [ Irish when they were born
](/en/moving-country/irish-citizenship/irish-citizenship-through-birth-or-
descent/) . Before 1 January 2005, everyone born on the island of Ireland was
an Irish citizen by birth. Following an amendment to the [ Constitution of
Ireland ](/en/government-in-ireland/irish-constitution-1/constitution-
introduction/) , citizenship by birth is no longer an automatic entitlement to
everyone born on the island of Ireland.

If you are born abroad, you are entitled to Irish citizenship if your parent
was born in Ireland. If your grandparents were born in Ireland, you may also
be able to claim citizenship through the [ Foreign Births Register
](/en/moving-country/irish-citizenship/foreign-births-register/) .

Residents of Ireland who have come from abroad can apply to become [ Irish
citizens through naturalisation ](/en/moving-country/irish-
citizenship/becoming-an-irish-citizen-through-naturalisation/) .

Citizens of Ireland are also EU citizens, which means that they can live, work
and study in any other EU member state.

This page describes who can claim or apply for Irish citizenship, the rights
that Irish citizens enjoy and answers some general questions on Irish
citizenship law.

##  Irish citizenship and the law

###  Irish citizenship in the Constitution of Ireland

The Constitution of Ireland is the basic law of the State and was adopted in
1937. It replaced the [ Constitution of the Irish Free State
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1922/act/1/enacted/en/print.html) .

The Constitution of the Irish Free State granted citizenship to anyone living
in the territory of the Irish Free State who:

  * At the time of the enacting of the constitution lived in the territory of the Irish Free State 

and

  * Was born in Ireland, or was the son or daughter of someone who was born in Ireland or 
  * Lived in Ireland for 7 years or more 

It did not give citizenship rights to anyone born after the enacting of the
Constitution of the Irish Free State. Instead, it said that this would be set
out in law.

When this was replaced by the [ Constitution of Ireland
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/cons/en/html) , anyone who was granted
citizenship of the Irish Free State under the provisions of the previous
Constitution became a citizen of Ireland. [ Article 9 of the Irish
Constitution ](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/cons/en/html#part2) says
that the future “acquisition and loss” of Irish citizenship would be done in
accordance with law.

The [ 19th Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1998/ca/19/enacted/en/print.html) was
passed following the Good Friday Agreement in 1998. This put the right to
citizenship by birth in the Constitution.

The [ 27th Amendment of the Irish Constitution
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2011/ca/29/enacted/en/html) was passed by
referendum in 2004. This removed the automatic right to citizenship by birth
for anyone born in Ireland after 1 January 2005 and gave authority back to the
Oireachtas (the Irish parliament) to decide on laws about citizenship by
birth.

###  The Irish Nationality and Citizenship Acts

The Constitution of Ireland allows the Oireachtas to make laws to decide who
can become an Irish citizen after the enactment of the Constitution (in 1937).
The most important citizenship law that was passed after 1937 was the [ Irish
Nationality and Citizenship Act of 1956
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1956/act/26/enacted/en/html) .

This Act had a number of important provisions:

  * Anyone born in Ireland was automatically an Irish citizen. People who were born in Northern Ireland were entitled to be Irish citizens if they chose it. 
  * A Foreign Births Register was established for descendants of Irish citizens born abroad. 
  * Wives of Irish citizens (but not husbands) could claim Irish citizenship by signing a post-nuptial declaration. This practice ended in 2005. 
  * Rules for naturalisation were set out. 

The Act was amended a number of times, most importantly in 2004, following the
[ 27th Amendment to the Constitution
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2004/ca/27/enacted/en/print#sec1) . This
removed the automatic right to Irish [ citizenship by birth ](/en/moving-
country/irish-citizenship/irish-citizenship-through-birth-or-descent/) to all
those born in Ireland.

##  Northern Ireland and Irish Citizenship

The Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956 gave people born in Northern
Ireland the right to claim Irish citizenship if they chose to do so.

The [ Good Friday Agreement ](/en/government-in-ireland/ireland-and-the-
uk/good-friday-agreement/) , which was signed between the Irish and British
governments in 1998, confirmed that people born in Northern Ireland could
choose to be either British or Irish citizens.

Since 1 January 2005, if you are born in Northern Ireland, you can claim Irish
citizenship if your parent (or parents) are either British or Irish citizens,
or one of them has lived on the island of Ireland for at least 3 out of the 4
years immediately before your birth.

You can read more about [ citizenship by birth or descent ](/en/moving-
country/irish-citizenship/irish-citizenship-through-birth-or-descent/) .

citizenship rules of your country of nationality if you are considering

If you are a dual citizen, you can apply to have your non-Irish passport
stamped with a [ Without Condition Endorsement
](https://www.irishimmigration.ie/my-situation-has-changed-since-i-arrived-in-
ireland/without-condition-dual-citizenship/) (also called Stamp 6). This stamp
says that you have a right to live in Ireland without any time conditions.

##  Citizenship by Irish descent or Irish associations

The Minster for Justice can waive some of the conditions of becoming an Irish
citizen where the applicant is of Irish descent or association.

This is at the discretion of the Minister. Irish descent or association means
that you are related by blood or adoption to an Irish citizen, or to someone
entitled to be an Irish citizen. If you are considering making an application
based on Irish descent or association, you should note the following:

  * You should have a reasonable period of legal residence in Ireland (at least 3 years) to show that you have a connection to Ireland. 
  * Applications based on descent from an Irish citizen going further back than a great-grandparent are generally refused. 
  * Applications based on being the parent or grandparent of an Irish citizen (by ‘ascent’), or a sibling, or other relative of an Irish citizen are generally refused. 
  * Applications based on Irish descent or associations can take up to 30 months to process.
