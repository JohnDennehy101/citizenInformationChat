#  Food safety and food poisoning

  * Introduction 
  * What is food poisoning? 
  * Unsafe or unsatisfactory food 
  * How to make a complaint about foodpoisoning 
  * Contact information 

##  Introduction

Food poisoning is an illness caused by eating contaminated food.

If you think you have food poisoning, you can usually treat yourself or your
child at home and get better within a few days. You can contact your family
doctor (GP) for advice. If you do not have a doctor, you can [ find a GP in
your area ](https://www2.hse.ie/services/find-a-gp/) using the Health Service
Executive (HSE) website.

This document explains what food poisoning is, what to do if you suspect you
have eaten contaminated food, and how to make a formal complaint about food
poisoning or an unsafe food premises.

##  What is food poisoning?

Food poisoning happens when you eat or drink contaminated food. The food may
be contaminated by bacteria, or by chemicals. People with weak immune systems
are more vulnerable to food poisoning than others.

Symptoms of food poisoning usually include:

  * Stomach pains 
  * Vomiting 
  * Fever 
  * Diarrhoea 

You can find information on how to [ treat symptoms of food poisoning at home
](https://www.hse.ie/eng/health/az/f/food-poisoning/symptoms-of-food-
poisoning.html#collapse_5) on the HSE website.

Read about [ how to prevent food poisoning in the home ](/en/health/food-
safety/food-safety-in-the-home/) , including how to:  

  * Store food safely in the fridge and freezer 
  * Prepare food safely 
  * Defrost frozen food correctly 
  * Maintain good kitchen hygiene 

##  Unsafe or unsatisfactory food

Food is unsafe or unsatisfactory if it:

  * Leads to vomiting, diarrhoea or stomach pains 
  * Contains a foreign object, such as glass, insects, or hair 
  * Is contaminated by chemicals, such as disinfectants or detergents 
  * Has a bad taste or smell 

If you have eaten or bought food that is unsafe, you have the right to make a
formal complaint.

You can also make a complaint if you are unhappy with the hygiene in a food
premises, including a supermarket or restaurant.

###  If there is something wrong with food you have been served

####  When eating out

Do not accept a meal in a restaurant or café if you think it is
unsatisfactory. Instead, you should send it back or ask for a fresh serving on
a clean plate.

Remember that hot food must be served piping hot.

###  If there is something wrong with groceries you have purchased

Make a note of information such as when and where you purchased the product,
the best before or use by date and the manufacturer's name and address.

##  How to make a complaint about foodpoisoning

You can make a formal complaint about food poisoning by either contacting your
local Environmental Health Officer or by contacting the Food Safety Authority
of Ireland (FSAI).

###  Contact your local Environmental Health Officer

HSE Environmental Health Officers investigate food safety complaints.

If you think you have food poisoning, you should [ contact your local
Environmental Health Officer
](https://www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/1/environ/environmental-health-
officers.html) with:

  * The name and address of the restaurant or supermarket 
  * Your complaint – you should provide as much detail as possible 

###  Contact the Food Safety Authority of Ireland

You can complete a [ complaint form on the FSAI website
](https://www.fsai.ie/makeitbetter) . This form is confidential and will not
be shared with the restaurant or shop you are complaining about.

The FSAI will send your completed form to a HSE Environmental Health Officer
who will then investigate your complaint.

You can also ring the FSAI on **0818 33 66 77** .

###  Analysis of food samples

The [ Public Analyst Laboratory
](https://www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/1/public-analyst-laboratory/) analyses

Environmental Health Service Offices. There is a fee for food sample analysis
if you submit samples directly to the laboratory. [ Read more about food
