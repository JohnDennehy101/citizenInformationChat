##  What is a medical card?

If you have a medical card, you can get certain health services free of
charge. Usually, your dependent spouse or partner and your children can also
get the same range of health services for free.

Your medical card is issued by the [ Health Service Executive (HSE)
](/en/health/health-system/health-service-executive/) .

###  **Who can apply for a medical card?**

If you are ‘ [ ordinarily resident ](/en/health/health-system/entitlement-to-
public-health-services#l2b820) ’ in Ireland you can apply for a medical card.
This means that you are living in Ireland and intend to live here for at least
one year.

To qualify for a medical card, your weekly income must be below a certain
figure for your family size. Cash income, savings, investments and property
(except for your own home) are taken into account in the means test (see ‘How
to qualify for a medical card’ below).

**GP visit cards:** If you do not qualify for a medical card on income
grounds, you may qualify for a [ GP visit card
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/health/medical-cards-and-gp-visit-
cards/gp-visit-cards/) .

**Medical cards for people coming from other countries**

If you are [ coming to Ireland from Ukraine ](/en/moving-country/asylum-
seekers-and-refugees/the-asylum-process-in-ireland/coming-to-ireland-from-
ukraine/) under the Temporary Protection Directive, you may be entitled to a
medical card immediately. There is a special medical card [ application form
(pdf) for people from Ukraine ](https://www.hse.ie/eng/services/healthcare-in-
ireland/medical-card-form-mc1-u-form-ukrainian.pdf) . Read [ information from
the HSE in Ukrainian and Russian ](https://www.hse.ie/eng/services/healthcare-
in-ireland/english/ukrainian-nationals.html) .

If you are coming from a country in the European Union, United Kingdom or
another non-EU country you can [ check if you can get a medical card and your
entitlement to public health services in Ireland. ](/en/health/health-
system/entitlement-to-public-health-services/)

###  What services does the medical card cover?

You are entitled to many health services, other services and some prescription
medicines with a medical card. You can check what is covered on our page [
Services for medical card and GP visit card holders
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/health/health-services/gp-and-
hospital-services/gp-services-to-medical-card-holders/) .

##  How to qualify for a medical card

To qualify for a medical card, your weekly income must be under a certain
amount. The HSE will complete a means test to check your income. Some people
can qualify automatically without a means test, see ‘Qualifying without a
means test’ below.

###  Means test

There are different guidelines for the means test depending on whether you are
aged over or under 70. See:

  * [ Means test rules for people **under 70** years of age ](/en/health/medical-cards-and-gp-visit-cards/medical-card-means-test-under-70s/)
  * [ Means test rules for people **over 70** years of age ](/en/health/medical-cards-and-gp-visit-cards/medical-card-means-test-over-70s/)

The HSE assessment of a couple for medical cards is based on the age of the
older person.

###  Discretionary medical card

If your income is above the limit, you may still be able to get a medical card
if your circumstances would result in financial hardship without one. This is
sometimes called a _discretionary medical card_ .

The [ application process for the discretionary medical card
](https://www2.hse.ie/services/medical-cards/discretionary-medical-cards.html)
is the same as for the means tested medical card, but you should also include
information about your family’s medical expenses in your application.

##  Do you qualify without a means test?

864 7100 or Lo-call 0818 22 44 78, contact your Local Health Office, or email
[ clientregistration@hse.ie ](mailto:clientregistration@hse.ie) .

###  Apply online for a medical card

You can **apply online** for a medical card and GP visit card on [
mymedicalcard.ie ](https://www.mymedicalcard.ie/) . This is the quickest
method of getting the card.

###  Apply by post for a medical card

Or you can **download** a medical card and GP visit card application form:

  * [ MC1 Medical Card and GP Visit Card Application Form (pdf) ](https://assets.hse.ie/media/documents/Medical_Card_and_GP_Visit_Card_Application_Form.pdf)
  * [ MC1(a) Medical Card and GP Visit Card Application Form - People Aged 70 Years or Older (pdf) ](https://assets.hse.ie/media/documents/Medical_Card_and_GP_Visit_Card_Application_Form_-_People_Aged_70_Years_or_Older.pdf) if you are aged over 70 

You can also get the application form and a list of participating GPs from
your local health centre or [ Local Health Office
](https://www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/1/lho/) for your area.

You return the form to the Client Registration Unit (address below), along
with any [ documents required ](http://www.hse.ie/eng/cards-schemes/medical-
card/what-documents-to-submit/) . If you are applying online, you can upload
photos, scans or photocopies of the original documents specified on the form.

You can track the progress of your medical card application on the [ HSE
website ](https://www2.hse.ie/services/medical-cards/after-you-apply-for-a-
medical-card.html) .

###  **Selecting a doctor**

The HSE have [ a list of doctors that accept medical card patients (pdf
](https://www.sspcrs.ie/libr/html/AllGPs_GMSContract.pdf) ).

If you apply online, the HSE will contact the doctor you select and ask them
to accept you as a medical card patient.

If you apply using the printed application form, you can call the GP that you
have chosen from the [ list of participating doctors (pdf)
](https://www.sspcrs.ie/libr/html/AllGPs_GMSContract.pdf) . Usually, the GP
you select must be within 7 miles of where you live. If the GP agrees to
accept you as a patient for [ medical card GP services ](/en/health/health-
services/gp-and-hospital-services/gp-services-to-medical-card-holders/) , you
can send them the form to sign.

If you use the printed application form and you have been a medical card
patient within the last 6 months and you want to keep the same GP, you should
state this on your form.

If your preferred participating GP cannot accept you as a medical card
patient, they may not be currently accepting new patients and you should try
another [ participating GP in your area (pdf)
](https://www.sspcrs.ie/libr/html/AllGPs_GMSContract.pdf) .

If you are refused by 3 GPs, the HSE will assign a doctor to you. State this
on your application, including the 3 names of declining GPs and their clinics.
The GPs need to be based at three different clinics.

##  Medical cards for children and young people

If you have a medical card, your child is included as a dependent on that card
and can get the same [ medical card services
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/health/medical-cards-and-gp-visit-
cards/medical-card/) as you. If you do not qualify for a medical card, your
child may still get a medical card if they:

  * Are in residential care 
  * Living in Direct Provision 
  * Have been diagnosed with cancer within the last 5 years 
  * Are in [ foster care ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/birth-family-relationships/adoption-and-fostering/fostering/)

###  **Adding an infant to your card**

If you have a medical card and you have a baby, you can apply for a card for
them if you are getting [ Child Benefit ](/en/social-welfare/families-and-
children/child-benefit/) for your new baby.

To apply, send a cover note with:

  * Your name, address, 
  * Your phone number, 
  * Your PPS number and your child's PPS number 
  * Your medical card details 
  * A photocopy of the child's birth certificate 

Send your letter to the Medical Card Unit, see below for the address.

###  Medical cards for people aged 16 to 25, including students

If you are aged 16 to 25 and dependent on a parent or guardian, you are
eligible for a medical card if your parent or guardian has a medical card.

**If you are already included on your family's card** , you will be sent your
own card when you turn 16.

**If you are not already included on your family’s card** you must send in
your own [ medical card application form (pdf)
](https://assets.hse.ie/media/documents/Medical_Card_and_GP_Visit_Card_Application_Form.pdf)
and your parents or guardians need to apply for you too. Send both
applications together.

This does not apply if their income is above the means test limit and they
have a discretionary medical card.

####  Applying for a medical card when aged 16 to 25

**If you live with your parent or guardian** and you have an income over the [
medical card income limit for a single person living with family
](/en/health/medical-cards-and-gp-visit-cards/medical-card-means-test-
under-70s/) , you are considered financially independent, and the usual means
test applies. you must complete your own [ medical card application form (pdf)
](https://assets.hse.ie/media/documents/Medical_Card_and_GP_Visit_Card_Application_Form.pdf)
.

**If you are not living with or dependent on a parent or guardian,** then you
are considered as financially independent, regardless of income. You must
complete your own [ medical card application form (pdf)
](https://assets.hse.ie/media/documents/Medical_Card_and_GP_Visit_Card_Application_Form.pdf)
and your application is assessed using the [ means test for people aged under
70 ](/en/health/medical-cards-and-gp-visit-cards/medical-card-means-test-
under-70s/) .

###  Domiciliary Care Allowance

If you have a child for whom you are getting [ Domiciliary Care Allowance
](/en/social-welfare/disability-and-illness/domiciliary-care-allowance/) , the
child is eligible for a medical card, without a means test.

If the child does not have a medical card or GP visit card, you can [ register
the child for a medical card online ](https://www.sspcrs.ie/portal/free-gp-
care-dca-web/pub) or [ download a registration form (pdf)
](http://www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/1/schemes/mc/dca/Final%20Version%20DCA%20Form.pdf)
.

If the child already has a medical card or GP visit card, you do not need to
register; they will be automatically registered for a medical card.

###  **Children diagnosed with cancer**

Children under the age of 18 who have been diagnosed with cancer within the
last 5 years are eligible for a medical card without a means test. The
application form does not require information about income but does require a
medical report. You can download the [ Medical Card Application Form for
Children under 18 years, Form MC1 (b) (pdf). ](https://www2.hse.ie/file-
library/medical-cards/medical-card-application-form-for-children-with-
cancer.pdf)

###  GP visit card for children under 8

If your child does not qualify for a medical card and is under 8, they can get
a [ GP visit card for children under 8
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/health/medical-cards-and-gp-visit-
cards/gp-visit-cards-for-under-8s/) without a means test. If your child is
over 8 years, the [ GP visit card
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/health/medical-cards-and-gp-visit-
cards/gp-visit-cards/) is means tested.

](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/health/health-services/children-s-
health/child-health-services/)

##  Appeals, reviews, renewals and managing your medical card

If your circumstances change, you must tell the HSE as you may no longer be
eligible for a medical card. For example, if your income or family
circumstances change, you must inform the Medical Card Unit as soon as
possible — their contact details are at the end of this webpage.

###  Medical card expiry date

Your medical card is valid for a set period of time. It has a ‘valid to’ date
on it.

Your card will be reviewed by the HSE periodically. The HSE will write to you
at the address you applied with to check if you still qualify for a medical
card.

They will also review your details to check if you qualify before they renew
your card.

###  **Medical card reviews and renewals**

You may be sent a letter with a PIN code from the HSE, inviting you to use the
online medical card application system to review your medical card.

If you do not provide the information they ask for, your application cannot be
re-assessed and your card may not be re-issued.

If you need a paper form, rather than the online review form, complete and
return [ MC1 Medical Card and GP Visit Card Application Form (pdf)
](https://assets.hse.ie/media/documents/Medical_Card_and_GP_Visit_Card_Application_Form.pdf)
. If you are aged over 70, the review notice you get will include a form that
you can use instead of the online review form.

If you complete the review form by the given date but the review process
continues past the expiry date of your card, the card’s validity may be
extended so that you can continue to use it while the review is taking place.
The extension is on a month-by-month basis so you should contact the Client
Registration Unit to confirm that your card has been extended and continues to
be valid.

####  **Your medical card when you** re **turn to work**

If you are getting a social welfare payment for a year or more and [ return to
work ](/en/employment/starting-work-and-changing-job/training-and-looking-for-
work/return-to-work/) , you may be able to keep your medical card for up to 3
years. You will need to submit a new medical card application stating that you
are applying on this basis. Your dependent family members may qualify to keep
their card, even if they become employed during this 3 year period.

People taking part in certain government schemes may keep their medical cards
while they are on the scheme. See the [ assessment guidelines (pdf)
](https://www.hse.ie/eng/staff/pcrs/medical-card-and-gp-visit-card-assessment-
guidelines.pdf) for the list of schemes.

####  **Your medical card if you move house**

You can use your medical card for up to 3 months if you are living temporarily
in a different area. In this case, you can attend any GP in the area
participating in the medical card scheme.

If you are going to be away longer than 3 months, you do not have to re-apply
for a new Medical Card. However, you must tell the HSE that your address has
changed and you will need to change your GP if you have moved area.

Contact your new [ Local Health Office
](http://www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/1/LHO/) or check the list of
participating doctors working in your new area.

####  Changing your address

If your address has changed, you must give the HSE your new address. You can
phone Lo-call 0818 22 44 78 or 01 864 7100 or email [ nmcu.cod@hse.ie
](mailto:nmcu.cod@hse.ie) . You will need to provide:

  * Proof of address such as a utility bill dated within the last 3 months 
  * Name and PPS number for everyone on the card 
  * Name and PPS number of dependants with their own cards living with you 

####  Changing your GP

If you are changing your GP, you complete a [ Change of Doctor Form (pdf)
](https://assets.hse.ie/media/documents/Medical_Card_or_GP_Visit_Card_change_of_GP_Form.pdf)
, giving details of the new doctor. The form is available online or by phoning
Lo-call 0818 22 44 78.

###  **Appealing if you are refused a medical card**

If you have been refused a medical card and are not satisfied with the
decision, you may have it reviewed. Your circumstances may have changed or you
may have left out some relevant information from the original application. The
contact details will also be contained in your letter of refusal.

The Appeals Office will conduct a reassessment of your application. This will
be conducted by HSE staff who were not involved in deciding on your original
application. You can read about [ appealing a medical card decision on the HSE
website ](https://www2.hse.ie/services/schemes-allowances/medical-
cards/applying/appeal/) .
