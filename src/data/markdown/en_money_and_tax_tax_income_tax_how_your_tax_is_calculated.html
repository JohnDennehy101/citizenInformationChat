##  Introduction

Nearly all income is taxable, also known as being _liable_ to tax. Tax is
charged as a percentage of your income, which is called the rate of tax.

However, there are [ income tax reliefs ](/en/money-and-tax/tax/income-tax-
credits-and-reliefs/introduction-to-income-tax-credits-and-reliefs/) that
reduce the amount of tax you have to pay.

This page explains how tax rates and tax reliefs are used to calculate the tax
you pay.

####  What is PAYE?

Tax on income that you earn from employment is deducted from your wages by
your employer on behalf of Revenue. This is known as Pay As You Earn (PAYE).

####  What is USC?

The Universal Social Charge (USC) is another tax on your income. It is charged
on your gross income. Gross income is the total amount of your income before
deductions such as pension contributions or [ PRSI ](/en/social-welfare/irish-
social-welfare-system/social-insurance-prsi/social-insurance/) are taken out.

Unlike income tax, USC is not reduced by tax reliefs (except for certain
capital allowances). [ Find out more about the Universal Social Charge
](/en/money-and-tax/tax/income-tax/universal-social-charge/) .

####  Income that is assessed for tax

Under the PAYE system, income tax is charged on:

  * Wages 
  * Fees 
  * Pensions 
  * Most types of interest 
  * Perks 
  * Profits 

Tax is payable on earnings of all kinds from your employment (including for
example, bonuses, overtime, non-cash pay or [ benefit-in-kind ](/en/money-and-
tax/tax/income-tax/taxation-of-benefits-from-employment/) ).

Money you get that is not liable to income tax may be liable to other taxes.

If you get gifts or inheritances, you may have to pay [ Capital Acquisitions
Tax ](/en/money-and-tax/tax/capital-taxes/capital-acquisitions-tax/) . If you
sell assets such as property or shares you may have to pay [ Capital Gains Tax
](http://www.revenue.ie/en/tax/cgt/leaflets/cgt2.html) .

##  Tax rates, tax bands and the standard rate cut-off point

Tax is charged as a percentage of your income. The percentage that you pay
depends on your income.

The first part of your income, up to a certain amount, is taxed at 20%. This
is known as the _standard rate of tax_ and the amount that it applies to is
known as the _standard rate tax band_ .

The rest of your income is taxed at the _higher rate of tax_ , 40%.

The amount that you can earn before you start to pay the higher rate of tax is
known as your _standard rate cut-off point_ . You can see [ examples of how to
calculate income tax ](/en/money-and-tax/tax/income-tax/case-study-
calculating-your-income-tax-case-studies/) using these tax rates and the
standard rate cut-off point.

If you are married or in a [ civil partnership
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/birth-family-relationships/civil-
partnerships/civil-partnerships/) , it may affect your tax bands and tax
reliefs. [ Read more about taxation of married people and civil partners
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/money-and-tax/tax/income-tax/taxation-
of-married-people/) .

**Standard rate cut-off points** |  **2024** |  **2023** |  **2022** |  **2021 and 2020**  
---|---|---|---|---  
|  **20%** |  **40%** |  **20%** |  **40%** |  **20%** |  **40%** |  **20%** |  **40%**

###  Example of standard rate cut-off point for a married couple or civil
partners with two incomes

In 2024, the standard rate cut-off point for a married couple or civil
partners is €51,000. If both are working, this amount is increased by the
lower of:

  * The income of the lower earner 
  * €33,000 

This means that one person can have a cut-off point of up to €51,000 and the
other person can have a cut-off point of up to €33,000.

Take an example where one person is earning €55,000 and their spouse is
earning €35,000.

The standard rate cut-off point for the couple is €51,000 plus an increase of
€33,000.

The increase in the standard rate band is not transferable between spouses, so
the tax bands for 2024 would be:

  * €51,000 @ 20% (= €10,200) and €4,000 @ 40% (= €1,600) for the first spouse 
  * €33,000 @ 20% (= €6,600) and €2,000 @ 40% (= €800) for the second spouse 

##  Tax credits

Tax credits reduce the amount of tax that you have to pay. After your tax has
been calculated, the amount of the tax credit is deducted from the tax you
owe. This means that a tax credit has the same value whether you pay the
standard or higher rate of tax.

You may be entitled to various tax credits depending on your personal
circumstances. You can get more information about the [ different types of tax
credits and reliefs ](/en/money-and-tax/tax/income-tax-credits-and-reliefs/)
and the [ tax reliefs available for people with disabilities ](/en/money-and-
tax/tax/tax-credits-and-reliefs-for-people-with-disabilities/) .

##  Tax allowances

Tax allowances reduce the amount of tax you must pay. The amount by which a
tax allowance will reduce your tax depends on what your highest rate of tax
is.

This is because the allowance is subtracted from your income before it is
taxed. In effect, it is ‘taken off the top’ of your income. The remainder of
your income is then taxed at the standard rate and, for any amount over  the
standard rate cut-off  , the higher rate of tax.

If, for example, you have a tax allowance of €200 and the highest rate of
income tax you pay is 20%, the amount of your income that is taxed at 20% is
reduced by €200. So your tax is reduced by €40 (€200 x 20%).

If you have the same tax allowance of €200 but the highest rate of tax that
you pay is 40%, then the amount of your income that is taxed at 40% is reduced
by €200. So your tax reduction is €80 (€200 x 40%).

This is known as tax allowance at the _marginal rate_ .

Allowances at the marginal rate include:

  * [ Tax relief on pension contributions ](/en/money-and-tax/personal-finance/pensions/)
  * [ Tax relief on nursing home expenses ](https://www.revenue.ie/en/personal-tax-credits-reliefs-and-exemptions/health-and-age/health-expenses/nursing-home-and-additional-nursing-care-expenses.aspx)
  * [ Tax relief on employing a carer for an incapacitated person ](/en/money-and-tax/tax/tax-credits-and-reliefs-for-people-with-disabilities/tax-relief-for-employing-a-home-carer/)
  * [ Seafarer's Allowance ](/en/money-and-tax/tax/income-tax-credits-and-reliefs/employment-tax-credits-and-reliefs/)

When your employer is calculating your income tax, marginal-rate allowances
are applied by [ raising your standard rate cut-off point
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/money-and-tax/tax/income-tax/how-your-
tax-is-calculated/#61fb30) , which reduces the amount of income taxed at the
higher rate.

##  Calculating your tax

By following these steps, you can calculate your income tax, taking into
account deductions, tax rates, tax credits, and any marginal rate allowances
that may apply.

####  Step 1: Determine your taxable income

Subtract the following from your total income to get your taxable income:

  * Pension contributions 
  * Salary used for a [ Travel Pass Scheme ](/en/travel-and-recreation/public-transport/public-transport-commuter-tickets-and-tax/) or [ Bike to Work Scheme ](/en/travel-and-recreation/cycling/cycle-to-work-scheme/)
  * Payments to a [ Permanent Health Benefit Scheme ](https://www.revenue.ie/en/personal-tax-credits-reliefs-and-exemptions/health-and-age/permanent-health-benefit-contributions/index.aspx) (to a maximum of 10% of income). 

####  Step 2: Consider the marginal rate allowance

If you have any [ tax allowances at the marginal rate
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/money-and-tax/tax/income-tax/how-your-
tax-is-calculated/#d43041) , you can calculate their effect by deducting them
from your taxable pay before calculating the percentages.

The way that your employer may apply marginal-rate allowances is by [
adjusting your standard rate cut-off point
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/money-and-tax/tax/income-tax/how-your-
tax-is-calculated/#61fb30) .

####  Step 3: Calculate the rate of tax

Your taxable income is taxed at:

  * 20% of your income below the  standard rate cut-off point 
  * 40% of your income over the standard rate cut-off point 

Add these two together to get the gross tax.

####  Step 4: Subtract tax credits

Subtract the value of your tax credits from your gross tax to get the amount
of tax that you have to pay.

##  Factors affecting the standard rate cut-off point

Your standard rate cut-off point is shown in your tax credit certificate,
which you can view in [ myAccount ](https://www.ros.ie/myaccount-
web/home.html) . The standard rate cut-off point may vary according to your
personal circumstances.

###  Increased cut-off point

Your standard rate cut-off point may be raised to reduce the amount of tax you
pay at the higher rate, for example, if you have marginal-rate tax allowances.

Marginal-rate tax allowances reduce the amount of tax you pay:

  * At the standard rate, by increasing your tax credits by the amount of the relief at 20% (the standard rate) 
  * At the higher rate, by increasing the standard rate cut-off point to reduce the amount of income taxed at the 40% higher rate 

####  **Example**

A  marginal-rate tax allowance  of €1,000 would reduce your tax by:

  * €200 if you pay income tax at the standard rate of 20% 
  * €400 if you also pay income tax at the higher rate of 40% 

Your standard rate tax credits are increased by €200 (€1,000 x 20% standard
rate). This is the amount of the benefit if you pay tax at the standard rate.

If you also pay tax at the higher rate, the higher rate of relief is applied
by increasing the standard rate cut-off point by €1,000. This means that
€1,000 which would otherwise be taxed at a rate of 40% is instead taxed at
20%, a saving of €200 (€400 – 200). This is in addition to the €200 saved by
the increase in tax credits, giving a total of €400.

This increase in the standard rate cut-off point has no effect if you pay tax
only at the standard rate, so you would only benefit from the increased tax
credits of €200.

###  Decreased cut-off point

Your standard rate cut-off point may be lowered in order to increase the
amount of your income taxed at the higher rate. This could happen, for
example, if most of your income is from your employer but you also have other
sources of income from which tax has not been deducted. By lowering the cut-
off point, the other income is taken into account in your employment
deductions.

**Benefits in kind and non-PAYE income** increase the amount of tax you pay
by:

  * Decreasing tax credits by 20% of the amount of the income (the standard rate) _and_
  * Decreasing the standard rate cut-off point by the amount of the income 

This has the opposite effect to the example above. For example, for €1,000
this would:

  * Decrease the tax credits by €200 (€1,000 x 20%), affecting both standard and higher rate taxpayers and 
  * Decrease the standard rate cut-off point by €1,000, increasing the tax liability for higher rate taxpayers only. The effect of this is that €1,000 would be taxed at 40% instead of 20%, an increase of €200. 

##  Tax credit certificate

Your tax credit certificate shows the rate of tax that applies to your income
and the tax credits you are entitled to. You can view, print or download your
tax credit certificate through [ myAccount ](https://www.ros.ie/myaccount-
web/home.html) .

At the start of the tax year, Revenue will automatically issue you a new tax
credit certificate. Employers are given a [ Revenue Payroll Notification (RPN)
](https://www.revenue.ie/en/employing-people/becoming-an-employer-and-ongoing-
obligations/employer-obligations-from-01-01-2019/revenue-payroll-
notification.aspx) , so they can deduct the correct amount of tax. If your
circumstances change during the year, Revenue will update your tax credit
certificate and RPN.

Your tax credit certificate and RPN tells your employer whether to calculate
the tax you owe using:

  * Cumulative basis 
  * Week 1 basis 
  * Temporary basis or emergency tax 

We explain each below.

###  Cumulative basis

Most people are taxed on a cumulative basis which makes sure that your tax and
USC liability is spread out evenly over the year. Under the cumulative basis,
your tax liability is calculated based on your total income from the start of
the tax year.

If a tax credit or standard rate cut off point (or both) are not used in full
in a pay period, the unused amount can be carried forward and used in the next
pay period within that tax year.

###  Week 1 basis

In certain cases Revenue may tell the employer to deduct tax on a week 1
(people paid weekly) or month 1 basis (people paid monthly). This is sometimes
called the ‘non-cumulative basis’.

It means that the pay for each period is dealt with on its own, separate from
previous weeks or months. Your employer will deduct income tax from your pay
on a week-to-week basis.

Your yearly tax credits and cut off points are not backdated to 1 January and
do not accumulate for each pay period. This means you could be [ overpaying
tax ](/en/money-and-tax/tax/income-tax/paye-overpayments-and-underpayments-of-
tax/) .

Revenue has information on [ how and why you may be taxed on a week 1 basis
](https://www.revenue.ie/en/jobs-and-pensions/starting-your-first-
job/week-1-basis.aspx) .

###  Temporary basis

You may be taxed on a temporary basis called emergency tax if you are changing
job or starting work for the first time. You can check Revenue’s current [
emergency tax and USC rates (pdf) ](https://www.revenue.ie/en/jobs-and-
pensions/documents/emergency-rates.pdf) . To avoid paying emergency tax you
should register the details of the new job with [ Revenue's Jobs and Pensions
online service in myAccount ](https://www.revenue.ie/en/online-
services/services/paye-services/add-job-pension.aspx) . You can get more
information about [ tax and starting work ](/en/employment/starting-work-and-
changing-job/starting-work/tax-and-starting-work/) or [ changing job
](/en/employment/starting-work-and-changing-job/changing-job/change-job-tax-
prsi/) .  

##  Exemptions from income tax

Income that may be exempt from tax includes the following:

  * Payments to approved pension schemes 
  * [ Statutory redundancy payments ](/en/employment/unemployment-and-redundancy/redundancy/what-is-redundancy/)
  * [ Certain social welfare payments ](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/claiming-a-social-welfare-payment/taxation-of-social-welfare-payments/)
  * Scholarship income 
  * Interest from savings certificates and Savings Bonds and National Instalment Savings Schemes, within limits 
  * [ Certain earnings by artists ](/en/money-and-tax/tax/income-tax/artists-exemption-from-income-tax/)
  * Certain payments in respect of disabilities linked with Thalidomide 
  * Wins from licensed lotteries 
  * Certain army pensions and allowances 
  * Payments made by the Health Service Executive to foster parents for the care of foster children 
  * Some compensation payments under employment law 
  * Compensation for personal injury that prevents an individual from maintaining themselves. Income arising from the investment of such a payment is also exempt if it is the main source of income, apart from Invalidity Pension for the injury. 

If you are on low pay, you may not be liable to pay any tax because your tax
credits and reliefs are more than or equal to the amount of tax you are due to
pay.

You are completely exempt from income tax if [ you are over 65 and your income
is below certain limits. ](/en/money-and-tax/tax/income-tax-credits-and-
reliefs/older-peoples-tax-credits-and-reliefs/) Revenue provides information
on [ Tax Exemption and Marginal Relief ](http://www.revenue.ie/en/personal-
tax-credits-reliefs-and-exemptions/marital-and-civil-status/exemption-and-
marginal-relief/index.aspx) which details available exemption limits and tax
relief. If your income is over the limit, then you may benefit from marginal
relief.
