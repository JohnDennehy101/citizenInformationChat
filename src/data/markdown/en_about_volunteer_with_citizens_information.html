##  Volunteer with Citizens Information

Join the team of volunteers who support staff within the Citizens Information
Service to provide information, advice and advocacy to the public. Citizens
Information Services help thousands of people on a range of topics including
social welfare, employment rights, housing and immigration.

If you enjoy meeting people, would like to work as part of a team, and believe
that you can explain services and entitlements to the public in simple
language, then volunteering in your local CIS might be the right fit for you!

Watch this video to find out more about the experience of volunteering in the
Citizens Information Service.

##  What is the Citizens Information Service?

Citizens Information Services (CISs) provide face-to-face services to the
public. Through trained staff and volunteers, CISs provide free, impartial and
confidential information, advice and advocacy services to the public.

Each Citizens Information Service covers a geographical area and delivers the
service through a network of Citizen Information Centres (CICs). There are
eight individual regional Citizens Information Services which are companies
limited by guarantee and are registered charities.

They cover the following areas: North Dublin, Dublin South, North Connacht and
Ulster, North Leinster, North Munster, South Connacht, South Leinster and
South Munster facilitating both rural and urban areas.

CISs provide information on various topics, including;

  * Employment rights 
  * Income support 
  * Social welfare 
  * Family matters 
  * Health services 
  * Housing 
  * Education 
  * Immigration 

Data on the type of information and advice looked for, the range of queries
and concerns raised by the public, and the top information categories and
trends arising each year can be found on the Citizens Information Board's [
DataHub ](https://www.citizensinformationboard.ie/en/data-hub/) .

If you think you would like to join CIS as a volunteer, please:

  * Read this page and watch the information videos 
  * Think about the responsibilities involved 
  * Find out [ what services are recruiting ](https://www.citizensinformationboard.ie/en/news/vacancies.html)

##  If I volunteer with Citizens Information, what will I do?

Citizens Information have a fantastic range of rewarding volunteer roles,
which can vary between local Citizens Information Centres. The main areas you
can expect to volunteer in are:

  * Providing information, advice and client support 
  * Administrative support 
  * Reception and customer service 

You will be asked to commit to either a full day or two half days per week.
Each CIS decides the minimum hours per week required. You will:

  * Work as part of a team with staff and other volunteers 
  * Address a wide range of inquiries from the public 
  * Participate in ongoing training in the main areas of services and entitlements 
  * Develop the expertise to find the right answers and share that information 
  * Take part in regular quality reviews, where the manager sits in with you while you deliver information to the public 
  * Use online systems and databases, so a certain level of computer literacy may be required 

###  Volunteer Board Director

Each Citizens Information Service is managed by a Board of Directors, who are
also volunteers. The overall function of the board is to provide oversight of
the delivery of the Citizens Information Service in accordance with a Service
Level Agreement (SLA) with the funder, the Citizens Information Board (CIB).

High standards of corporate governance in CIS voluntary boards are critical to
ensuring a positive contribution to the delivery of information, advice and
advocacy services.

board member in the Citizens Information Service.
