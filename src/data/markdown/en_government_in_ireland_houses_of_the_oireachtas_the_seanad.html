##  Introduction

Seanad Éireann is the senate of Ireland. It is the Upper House of the
Oireachtas (Ireland’s national Parliament) and is located in Dublin. The lower
house of the Oireachtas is [ the Dáil ](/en/government-in-ireland/houses-of-
the-oireachtas/dail-eireann/) .

The Seanad is composed of 60 members known as Senators. Eleven of the Senators
are nominated by the Taoiseach and 49 are elected in Seanad elections.

One Senator takes the role of _Cathaoirleach_ (Speaker/Chairperson). The
Cathaoirleach chairs proceedings in the House and must act impartially.

Senators are not officially separated into political parties. However, they
usually divide into groups supporting and opposing [ Government
](/en/government-in-ireland/how-government-works/national-
government/government-of-ireland/) business when voting on issues.

##  What does the Seanad do?

The main function of Seanad Éireann is in relation to [ legislation
](/en/government-in-ireland/houses-of-the-oireachtas/legislation/) . A Bill
may start life in either the [ Dáil ](/en/government-in-ireland/houses-of-the-
oireachtas/dail-eireann/) (the Lower House of the Oireachtas) or the Seanad.

The Seanad may propose amendments, reject or pass a Bill. The Dáil has the
power to over-ride the Seanad's rejection of a Bill.

Bills that will result in government spending (known as money bills) must come
from the Dáil and cannot be amended in the Seanad.

The Seanad has other functions, which it shares with the Dáil, such as:

  * The removal from office of the [ President ](/en/government-in-ireland/houses-of-the-oireachtas/president-introduction-to-the-president-of-ireland/) or a judge of the [ Supreme Court ](/en/justice/courts-system/supreme-court/) , [ Court of Appeal ](/en/justice/courts-system/court-of-appeal/) or [ High Court ](/en/justice/courts-system/high-court/)
  * Declaring a state of emergency 
  * Annulling statutory instruments 

##  Who can become a Senator?

To become a Senator you must be:

  * A citizen of Ireland 
  * Over 21 years old 

You must not be:

  * Serving a prison sentence of more than 6 months 
  * A person of unsound mind 
  * A judge 
  * A senior official of the European Union 
  * A civil servant 
  * A member of An Garda Síochána or a full-time member of the Defence Forces 

##  How is the Seanad elected?

Forty nine of the Seanad’s 60 members are elected and 11 are nominated by the
Taoiseach. Of the 49 elected members, 43 are elected from panels of candidates
representing specified vocational interests. The remaining 6 members are
elected by university graduates of certain universities.

A Seanad election takes place up to 90 days after Dáil Éireann has dissolved.
This means that the new Dáil has assembled before the Seanad election takes
place.

###  **Seanad panel candidates**

Candidates for these panels are selected by either a registered nominating
organisation, or by members of the incoming Dáil or outgoing Seanad.

These registered nominating organisations are mainly non-profit making and
must be representative of one of the panels listed below. The register of [
nominating organisations (pdf)
](https://data.oireachtas.ie/ie/oireachtas/electoralProcess/nominatingBodies/seanad/2018/2018-03-21_register-
of-nominating-bodies-2018_en.pdf) is reviewed in February each year.

The following people may vote in an election of panel members:

  * Members of the incoming Dáil 
  * Members of the outgoing Seanad 
  * Members of county councils and city councils 

The panels are formed of candidates who have knowledge and practical
experience in the following areas:

####  **Cultural and educational panel**

People involved with national language, culture, literature, art, education,
law and medicine

####  Agricultural panel

People involved with agriculture and fisheries

####  Labour panel

**** People involved in either organised or unorganised labour

####  Industrial and commercial panel

**** People involved in industry and commerce, banking, finance, accountancy,
engineering and architecture

####  Administrative panel

People involved with public administration and social services including
voluntary social activities

###  **Nominations by the Taoiseach**

The [ Taoiseach ](/en/government-in-ireland/how-government-works/national-
government/government-of-ireland/) of a new Dáil Eireann nominates 11 members
of the Seanad. The Taoiseach has the final say on who is nominated, although
in the case of a coalition Government it is usual for the Taoiseach to
nominate some candidates on the advice of the junior coalition partner.

Under the Constitution, 2 Senators may become members of the Government. They
are nominated by the Taoiseach.

###  **University Candidates**

Six members of the Seanad are elected by university graduates - 3 members are
elected by graduates of the [ University of Dublin (Trinity College)
](https://www.tcd.ie/seanad/) and 3 are elected by graduates of the [ National
University of Ireland (NUI)
](http://www.nui.ie/elections/docs/institutions.pdf) .

The NUI consists of:

  * University College Dublin 
  * University College Cork 
  * National University of Ireland, Galway 
  * Maynooth University 

The NUI also awards degrees in a number of other colleges. The graduates of
these [ recognised colleges (pdf)
](http://www.nui.ie/elections/docs/institutions.pdf) with NUI awards may also
vote in the Seanad elections.

A full list of the institutions in the NUI Seanad Éireann constituency is
available on [ nui.ie ](http://www.nui.ie/elections/docs/institutions.pdf) .

To put yourself forward as a candidate for the Seanad in the university
constituency, you must be nominated by 2 registered electors for a university.
Eight other registered electors for the university concerned must assent to
your nomination. You do not have to be a graduate of the university concerned
or be connected to it in any way. However, you must be eligible to become a
Senator.

Every citizen of Ireland who is at least 18 years old and who has received a
degree, other than an honorary degree, from the university concerned is
entitled to vote in a Seanad election.

You do not have to live in Ireland to be registered to vote for the Seanad.
