  * Who can apply? 
  * Residence rules 
  * Documents you need 
  * Criminal record and national security 
  * Application fee 
  * How to apply 
  * Decisions and appeals 

##  Introduction

A new scheme to allow people who have no immigration status in Ireland to
apply for legal residence opened for applications between 31 January 2022 and
31 July 2022. A separate scheme for international protection applicants was
open until 7 August 2022.

##  Who can apply?

The undocumented scheme closed on 31 July 2022. The international protection
scheme closed on 7 August 2022.

The scheme was for people who had been undocumented in Ireland for at least 4
years at the start of the scheme, or for at least 3 years for families with
children under 18.

###  International protection applicants

International protection applicants, who have been waiting for a decision for
2 years or more, could apply through a separate application process.
Applications opened on 7 February 2022 and closed on 7 August 2022.

##  Residence rules

###  Undocumented applicants

The undocumented scheme has now closed. If you have made an application you
will be contacted with a decision.

###  International protection applicants

The international protection scheme has now closed. If you have made an
application you will be contacted with a decision.

##  Documents you need

You must be able to prove your identity and that you have lived in Ireland for
the required period.

You do not need to prove that you have a particular level of income or
savings.

The [ list of documents is now available
](https://www.irishimmigration.ie/required-documents-guide-regularisation-of-
long-term-undocumented-migrants-scheme/) for undocumented applicants and for [
international protection applicants ](http://www.ipo.gov.ie/en/IPO/IPRSU-
Application-Form-FAQ.pdf/Files/IPRSU-Application-Form-FAQ.pdf) .

##  Criminal record and national security

You could be refused if you have been convicted of serious criminal offences.
You must declare all criminal convictions as part of your application.

Your application could be refused if you are deemed a threat to national
security.

##  Application fee

The application fee is:

  * €700 for a family 
  * €550 for an individual 
  * No fee for international protection applicants 

You must pay the full fee at the time when you make your application.

##  How to apply

###  Undocumented applicants

Applications are now closed.

###  International protection applicants

Applications are now closed.

##  Decisions and appeals

If your application is approved, you will get a letter granting you permission
to remain in Ireland for 2 years. Each member of your family that was part of
your application will get a separate letter.

You must [ register your permission ](/en/moving-country/moving-to-
ireland/rights-of-residence-in-ireland/registration-of-non-eea-nationals-in-
ireland/) and get an Irish Residence Permit. You will get a Stamp 4, which
means you can work without an employment permit. Children under 16 do not have
to register.

After the 2 years your permission can then be renewed.

###  Refusals

If your application is refused, you will get a letter which will tell you the
reasons why it was refused. You can [ appeal this decision
](https://inisonline.jahs.ie/user/login) . If your appeal is successful, you
will be granted permission to remain in Ireland.

If your appeal is not successful, your case will be [ referred to the
Repatriation Unit ](https://www.irishimmigration.ie/my-situation-has-changed-
since-i-arrived-in-ireland/spouse-civil-partner-of-irish-national-
scheme/repatriation-division/) of ISD. If you have a current outstanding
application for international protection, or some other residency, that will
still be processed if you are refused residence under this scheme.

You can read [ more about the Scheme
](https://www.irishimmigration.ie/regularisation-of-long-term-undocumented-
migrant-scheme/) on the ISD website.

The International Protection Office has [ frequently asked questions
](http://www.ipo.gov.ie/en/IPO/IPRSU-Application-Form-FAQ.pdf/Files/IPRSU-
Application-Form-FAQ.pdf) about the scheme for international protection
applicants.
