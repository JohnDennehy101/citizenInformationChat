##  Introduction

The [ Director of Public Prosecutions ](https://www.dppireland.ie/) (DPP) is
responsible for the prosecution of people charged with committing crimes in
the State.

The Chief Prosecution Solicitor acts as solicitor to the DPP. Prosecution
solicitors represent the DPP in all [ courts
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/justice/courts_system/) in Dublin and
local state solicitors represent the DPP in courts outside Dublin.

##  What does the DPP do?

The Director of Public Prosecutions has several duties and is independent in
the performance of their functions.

The DPP’s duties are to:

  * Enforce criminal law in courts on behalf of the people of Ireland 
  * Direct and supervise public prosecutions on [ indictment ](/en/justice/criminal-law/criminal-offences/classification-of-crimes-in-criminal-cases/) in the courts 
  * Give general direction and advice to [ An Garda Síochána ](/en/justice/law-enforcement/garda-siochana-national-police-force/) in relation to [ summary cases ](/en/justice/criminal-law/criminal-offences/classification-of-crimes-in-criminal-cases#l689a5)
  * Give specific direction to the Gardaí in cases where requested 

The DPP's Office is independent. The Government cannot order the DPP to
prosecute or not to prosecute any particular case.  

###  Who decides whether to prosecute or not?

The DPP decides whether to prosecute in serious criminal cases, such as
murder, manslaughter, sexual offences, or fatal road incidents.

The Gardaí may prosecute less serious crimes, but they still prosecute in the
name of the DPP who has the right to tell the Gardaí how to deal with the
case.

You can read further information on [ The Role of the DPP (pdf)
](https://www.dppireland.ie/app/uploads/2022/12/ENG-Role-of-the-DPP-
August-2022.pdf) and [ how prosecution decisions are made
](https://www.dppireland.ie/victims-witnesses/how-we-make-prosecution-
decisions/) . You can also read the DPP’s [ Guidelines for Prosecutors
](https://www.dppireland.ie/publication-category/guidelines-for-prosecutors/)
.

##  If the DPP decides to prosecute

If the DPP decides to prosecute, the Gardaí charge the suspect in the case and
bring them before the District Court. The suspect is known as ‘the accused’ or
‘the defendant’ from this point on.

The Gardaí then compile a book of evidence against the accused. The book of
evidence includes:

  * Statements from the victim and other witnesses 
  * A list of physical evidence that will appear in court, like photographs or weapons 
  * Evidence the prosecution thinks witnesses will give in court 
  * Other relevant documents 

Once the prosecution has gathered all the evidence needed for the trial, it
will give the book of evidence to the accused and the District Court will set
a date for the trial.

###  Will I be told if the DPP decides to prosecute?

If you are the victim in the case, the Gardai will tell you if the DPP decides
to prosecute and will keep you informed of developments. You will be told the
time, date and place of the court hearing.

If the case relates to a sexual offence or a violent crime, the DPP will offer
you a pre-trial meeting with the investigating Garda, the solicitor, and the
barrister dealing with the case. You will be told about the trial process, but
you will not be able to discuss witness evidence.

If the case relates to another type of offence, you can request a pre-trial
meeting.

###  Can I be called as a witness?

If you have information about the crime, you can be called as a [ witness
](/en/justice/witnesses/) at the trial.

###  After the trial

When a court has found the accused guilty, it will decide on the [ sentence
](/en/justice/criminal-law/criminal-trial/sentence/) .

If the DPP considers the court sentence to be too lenient, it may appeal the
sentence to the Court of Appeal. The DPP cannot appeal against a sentence
given in the District Court.

](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/justice/victims-of-crime/your-rights-
as-a-victim-of-crime/#748169) . You can also read more about [ sentencing and
appeals ](https://www.dppireland.ie/criminal-justice-system/sentencing-and-
appeals/) , and [ the criminal justice system
](https://www.dppireland.ie/criminal-justice-system/) on the DPP website.

##  If the DPP decides not to prosecute

If the DPP decides not to prosecute in a particular case, the reasons are
given to the investigating Gardaí and are kept confidential.

The DPP’s office does not meet people to discuss decisions. You can read more
information on the [ decision to prosecute
](https://www.dppireland.ie/criminal-justice-system/decision-to-prosecute/) .

###  Why would the DPP not prosecute?

The most common reason for deciding not to prosecute is a lack of evidence.
The DPP needs to have enough evidence to convince the court beyond a
reasonable doubt that a person is guilty.

There are some circumstances where the DPP may decide it is better not to
prosecute despite having enough evidence, for example, if the offender is
under 18 or is seriously ill.

###  Can I request reasons for the decision?

You can request a summary of the reasons for the decision not to prosecute if
you are:

  * A victim of crime, and the decision was made after 16 November 2015 
  * A family member of a victim in a fatal case, where the death took place after 22 October 2008 
  * A solicitor acting on behalf of either of the above 

You must make your request within 28 days of the date you are told of the
decision not to prosecute.

If the decision not to prosecute was made by the Gardaí, a victim can ask the
Gardaí for a summary of the reasons for the decision.

###  Can I request a review of the decision?

You can request a review of the decision not to prosecute if you are:

  * A victim 
  * A family member of a victim in a fatal case 
  * A solicitor acting on behalf of either of the above 

Your request for a review must be submitted within 56 days of being informed
of the decision, or within 28 days of the date of the summary of reasons
letter if you asked for this.

##  How to request reasons or a review of the decision
