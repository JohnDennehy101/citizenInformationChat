##  Public health care for people coming to Ireland

If you are a national of the [ European Economic Area (EEA)
](http://www.inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/Pages/eu-eea-countries) , the UK or
Switzerland, or if you are normally resident in Ireland, you are entitled to
receive the same level of health care as Irish citizens. Depending on your
income, you may be eligible for a [ medical card ](/en/health/medical-cards-
and-gp-visit-cards/medical-card/) , which entitles you to the full range of
medical services at no cost.

If you are not from an EEA member state or Switzerland, you will be entitled
to certain services free of charge and you will have to pay for the remainder.

If you are coming to live, work, study or retire in Ireland you can find out [
more information on eligibility for public health services

are coming to Ireland on holiday or on a short stay (for example, on
business), you can read [ more information on health services for visitors to
Ireland. ](/en/health/health-system/health-services-and-visitors-to-ireland/)

##  Private health care for people coming to Ireland

In addition to the public health system, people in Ireland can avail of a
range of private health care services. You must pay the full costs of
treatment if you opt for private health care.

There are a number of [ private health insurance ](/en/health/health-
system/private-health-insurance/) companies in Ireland. Providers include [
VHI Healthcare ](https://www.vhi.ie/) , [ Laya Healthcare
](https://www.layahealthcare.ie/) , [ Irish Life Health
](http://www.irishlifehealth.ie/) and [ HSF Health Plan ](http://www.hsf.ie/)
. As long as you are from the EEA or Switzerland or normally resident in
Ireland, you are entitled to the same benefits from your private health
insurance with any of these companies as any other Irish citizen.

Up to €1,000 for adults and €500 for children of your private health insurance
premium attracts [ tax relief ](/en/money-and-tax/tax/income-tax-credits-and-
reliefs/taxation-and-medical-expenses/) at the standard rate (20%). This tax
relief is deducted at source by the health insurance provider.
