##  Staying safe online

Our lives revolve around the internet, computers, smartphones and other
devices.

While the internet has many benefits, it also poses risks. Online safety is
essential for both children and adults.

###  **Keeping users safe online: new and upcoming changes**

In March 2023, Coimisiún na Meán (this means the media commission) became the
new media regulator for online safety, television broadcasting and video-on-
demand services.

Since 17 February 2024, you have the right to [ make a complaint against
online platforms ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/consumer/how-to-
complain/complain-about-online-platforms/) if you encounter harmful or illegal
content, need to report a violation of terms, or have concerns about targeted
ads.

Coimisiún na Meán is currently developing Ireland’s first [ Online Safety Code
(pdf). ](https://www.cnam.ie/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Draft-Online-Safety-
Code-Public-Consultation-QA.pdf)

](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/consumer/buying-digital-content-and-
services/online-safety/#lcc433) below.

##  Keep your child safe online

Understanding the risks your child may face online is crucial.

Dangers include the loss of privacy, exposure to inappropriate content,
cyberbullying and online grooming.

Learn about the apps they use and discuss:

  * Adjusting security and privacy settings 
  * Blocking or unfriending unwanted contacts 
  * Deleting profiles and accounts 
  * Dealing with inappropriate content 

Safeguard your child online by using:

  * **Parental controls** to manage your child’s online activities 
  * **Filters** to restrict their access to specific content, using tools such as SafeSearch 
  * **Time tracker tools** to monitor their social media with available app features

##  Protect yourself online

As adults, staying safe online is essential with the growing number and
sophistication of cybercrimes.

Learn [ how to avoid scams
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/consumer/buying-digital-content-and-
services/scams-and-fraud/) , especially when [ shopping online
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/consumer/shopping/shopping-online/) .
Verify the company is legitimate and only use secure ways to pay. Be
especially careful about transferring money to people or websites you do not
know.

**Online scams**

Internet scams can affect anyone at any time. Be alert and know what to do to
[ help protect yourself from scams
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/consumer/buying-digital-content-and-
services/scams-and-fraud/) .

If you think you have been the victim of a scam or fraud, report it to [ your
local Garda Station ](https://www.garda.ie/en/contact-us/station-directory/) .
Bring any relevant information you have (like emails or bank statements).

**Phishing and malware**

Be cautious about [ unsolicited emails or texts
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/consumer/phone-internet-tv-and-postal-
services/stopping-junk-mail/) . Never click on a link you do not trust or
download suspicious content.

The Europol European Cybercrime Centre has [ information on malware basics
](https://www.europol.europa.eu/activities-services/public-awareness-and-
prevention-guides/malware-basics) .

##  What is illegal content?

Content is illegal if it breaks Irish or EU law.

A person can be guilty of a criminal offence if their online content includes:

  * A serious threat of violence that is believable 
  * A campaign to harass someone (including cyberbullying) 
  * Making threats, being abusive or saying insulting things that could create hate against a group of people based on their race, colour, nationality, religion, ethnic or national origins, membership of the travelling community or sexual orientation 
  * Sending an unwanted picture of someone’s genitals to cause distress, fear or alarm 
  * Engaging in offensive sexual behaviour 
  * Sharing an intimate picture without the person’s permission 
  * Urging someone to try harm themselves or providing information on how to attempt suicide 
  * Creating or sharing materials involving the sexual abuse of children or promoting such materials 
  * Encouraging terrorist activities or making threats to commit acts of terrorism 

Coimisiún na Meán has a useful table showing which pieces of legislation cover
each type of illegal content – see ‘ [ What makes content illegal’
](https://www.cnam.ie/online-safety/) .

##  How to report online crime or threats

###  **Illegal content**

Online platforms must have a way for you to tell them about illegal content.
If you tell them about something illegal, they must review it and act if they
agree. They must do this quickly and tell you what they decide.

If the platform does not delete the content or respond to you, you can [ make
a complaint ](/en/consumer/how-to-complain/complain-about-online-platforms/)
to Coimisiún na Meán.

If you or someone else is in immediate danger or risk of harm, call emergency
services, for free, by dialling 112 from any phone.

You can also report illegal content anonymously and confidentially to the
Internet Service Providers Association (ISPAI) at [ Hotline.ie
](https://www.hotline.ie/) .

###  **Financial transaction disputes**

You can dispute a transaction with your bank or credit card company if you did
not authorise the transaction. Contact your bank or credit card company and [
ask for a chargeback ](https://www.ccpc.ie/consumers/money/credit-
cards/disputed-card-transactions-chargeback/) .

###  **Fraud**

Report fraudulent activity to your [ local Garda station
](https://www.garda.ie/en/Crime/Cyber-crime/I-ve-been-caught-out-by-an-online-
scam-What-should-I-do-.html) or to the [ Garda National Economic Crime Bureau
(GNECB) ](https://www.garda.ie/en/about-us/specialist-units/garda-national-
economic-crime-bureau/) .

###  **Personal information complaints**

Complain about the use of your personal data to the Data Protection Commission
using the [ online form ](https://forms.dataprotection.ie/contact) .

##  The law covering online safety

In December 2022, the [ Online Safety and Media Regulation Act 2022
](https://www.oireachtas.ie/en/bills/bill/2022/6/) was signed into law. It
aims to improve online safety for children.

The Online Safety Commissioner (OSC) is part of Coimisiún na Meán. The OSC
will regulate online services and will have enforcement powers to deal with
disputes.

[ Coimisiún na Meán ](https://www.cnam.ie/) came into operation on 15 March
2023. It is currently developing Ireland’s first [ Online Safety Code (pdf).
](https://www.cnam.ie/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Draft-Online-Safety-Code-
Public-Consultation-QA.pdf)

The Code will:

  * Establish important rules that online platforms (like social media) will have to follow 
  * Make sure platforms are responsible for protecting the safety of their users 
  * Impose severe fines (up to €20 million) on platforms that do not meet these safety requirements
