##  Introduction

Dáil Éireann is one of the Houses of the _Oireachtas_ , the national
parliament. The upper house of the Oireachtas is the [ Seanad
](/en/government-in-ireland/houses-of-the-oireachtas/the-seanad/) .

The elected members of Dáil Éireann are called TDs – _Teachta Dála_ (or
Deputies). TDs are elected directly to the Dáil in a [ general election
](/en/government-in-ireland/elections-and-referenda/types-of-elections-and-
referendums/the-general-election/) . If a vacancy occurs at the Dáil, the seat
will be filled by a [ bye-election ](/en/government-in-ireland/elections-and-
referenda/types-of-elections-and-referendums/by-elections-in-ireland/) .

The [ Constitution ](/en/government-in-ireland/irish-
constitution-1/constitution-introduction/) states that the number of TDs
cannot be more than one for every 20,000 of the population and cannot be less
than one for every 30,000.

There are currently 160 TDs.

Ireland is divided into 39 _constituencies_ and each constituency must elect
at least three members to the Dáil.

The Dáil is part of the legislative (or law making) branch of the Irish State.
Its members also elect the [ Taoiseach and Government ](/en/government-in-
ireland/how-government-works/national-government/government-of-ireland/)
following a general election.

###  **Electoral Commission constituency review 2023**

[ The Electoral Commission ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/government-
in-ireland/elections-and-referenda/voting/electoral-commission/) published its
[ review of Ireland's electoral constituencies
](https://www.electoralcommission.ie/constituency-reviews.html) on 30 August
2023.

Based on its recommendations, the number of TDs and constituencies will be
increased when the current Dáil is dissolved.

The following changes were introduced by the [ Electoral (Amendment) Act 2023
](https://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2023/act/40/enacted/en/print.html) :

  * The number of TDs in the Dáil will increase to 174 (from 160) 
  * The number of Dáil constituencies will increase to 43 (from 39) 

##  Eligibility for Dáil Éireann

To be eligible for membership of the Dáil, you must be:

  * An Irish citizen 
  * At least 21 

You also cannot be **both** a member of the Dáil and:

  * A member of a local authority (until 2003, it was possible to be an elected Councillor and a TD) 
  * A member of the [ European Parliament ](/en/government-in-ireland/european-government/eu-institutions/european-parliament/) (an MEP), or another senior official in an institution of the European Union 
  * A member of the [ Garda Síochána ](/en/justice/law-enforcement/garda-siochana-national-police-force/) or a full-time member of the [ Defence Forces ](/en/government-in-ireland/security-and-emergency-services/defence-forces/)
  * A [ civil servant ](/en/government-in-ireland/how-government-works/national-government/the-civil-service/) , unless your contract specifically allows it 
  * Serving a prison sentence of greater than 6 months 
  * The [ President ](/en/government-in-ireland/houses-of-the-oireachtas/president-introduction-to-the-president-of-ireland/) , a Senator, the [ Comptroller and Auditor General ](/en/government-in-ireland/how-government-works/standards-and-accountability/comptroller-and-auditor-general/) or a judge 

[ The Electoral Act 1992
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1992/act/23/section/41/enacted/en/html)
also says that you cannot be a TD if you are ‘of unsound mind’.

##  The role of TDs

Your TD is your elected representative in Dáil Éireann.

A TD can be part of a political party or independent. Usually, the party with
the most TDs forms [ the Government ](/en/government-in-ireland/how-
government-works/national-government/government-of-ireland/) . Following a [
general election ](/en/government-in-ireland/elections-and-referenda/types-of-
elections-and-referendums/the-general-election/) , if no party has enough TDs
elected to form a government, a smaller party (or parties) might join with a
larger party to form a _coalition government_ , or there might be an agreement
to support a government even though it does not have a majority of TDs (a
_minority government_ ).

A TD that is part of the government might be chosen as [ a Minister of State
](/en/government-in-ireland/how-government-works/national-
government/departments-of-state/) . If a TD is not part of the government,
they might support the government, or be in opposition.

###  The work of a TD locally

TDs have both national and local roles. As your local representative, a TD can
ask questions in the Dáil or raise issues that are important to you or your
local area. Most TDs have constituency clinics, where you can meet them and
discuss issues that might then be raised in the Dáil or in PQs. [ A full list
of current TDs is published on Oireachtas.ie
](https://www.oireachtas.ie/en/members/tds/?term=/ie/oireachtas/house/dail/31)
.

###  The work of a TD nationally

TDs are an important part of the [ law-making function ](/en/government-in-
ireland/houses-of-the-oireachtas/legislation/) of Dáil Éireann. They can
propose new legislation, even if they are not part of the government (in
_Private Member’s Bills_ ). They debate proposed legislation, examine drafts
and suggest amendments. Finally, they vote on the legislation, which, if it
passes, will then go to the Seanad to be debated and voted on.

TDs appoint the Taoiseach and the Government following a general election.

A TD might sit on a [ specialist committee
](https://www.oireachtas.ie/en/committees/32/procedure-dail/our-role/) , which
can advise the Dáil on a broad range of legislative, social, economic and
financial issues. A TD might also sit on a committee that looks at the
Government’s spending, or examines the work of a particular government
department (for example, the Joint Committee on Health). Committees also
examine draft legislation.

##  The Ceann Comhairle

When a new Dáil is formed after a general election, the first thing it does is
elect a _Ceann Comhairle_ from the members of the Dáil (TDs).

The Ceann Comhairle is the chairperson of the Dáil, and is responsible for:

  * Keeping order in the Dáil 
  * Calling on members to speak 
  * Making sure that the business of the Dáil follows the rules for procedure in the Dáil ( _the_ _standing orders_ ) 
  * Running the Committee on Procedure, which considers changes to the standing orders 
  * Supervising voting, counting votes and declaring the results 

Even though the Ceann Comhairle is a member of a political party, he or she
must act impartially and must try to ensure that all parties and independent
members are treated fairly.

The Ceann Comhairle is automatically re-elected to the next Dáil, and does not
have to contest a [ general election ](/en/government-in-ireland/elections-
and-referenda/types-of-elections-and-referendums/the-general-election/) .

The Ceann Comhairle has the casting vote when there is a tie of votes in the
Dáil.

##  Parliamentary Questions (PQs)

TDs can ask the Taoiseach and government ministers questions. These are called
_Parliamentary Questions_ or _PQs_ .

The Taoiseach answers questions on Tuesdays on matters relating to his own
department. Other government ministers reply to questions on a rota basis.
This means that they take turns to answer questions, and the rota is repeated
every 5 weeks or so.

A TD cannot ask more than 2 oral questions to a Minister, or 3 to the
Taoiseach, but there is no limit to the number of written questions that can
be sent. Every day 5 oral questions are given priority.

The Minister must be given 3 days’ notice for priority oral questions and 4
days’ notice for other questions. The Ceann Comhairle may accept questions
about an urgent issue at short notice. These are called private notice
questions and are taken at the end of question time.

[ PQs and replies are published
](https://www.oireachtas.ie/en/debates/questions/) on the Oireachtas website.

##  Dáil privileges

[ The Irish Constitution ](/en/government-in-ireland/irish-
constitution-1/constitution-introduction/) sets out rights and privileges that
apply to TDs and Senators when they are undertaking their work in the
Oireachtas.

TDs may not be arrested when they are going to or returning from the Houses of
the Oireachtas. This does not apply to arrest for treason, felony (a serious
crime that must be tried before a jury) or breach of the peace. This privilege
does **not** mean that TDs are immune from prosecution.

TDs cannot be sued for [ defamation ](/en/justice/civil-law/law-on-
defamation/) based on a speech given in the House. If a member of the public
believes that a TD has defamed them in the Oireachtas, they can make a
submission to the [ Dáil Committee on Parliamentary Privileges and Oversight
](https://www.oireachtas.ie/en/committees/33/privileges-and-oversight-dail/) .
If a TD is found to have abused this privilege, the Committee can discipline
them.

##  Dissolution of the Dáil

The Dáil can sit for a maximum of 5 years. This means that there must be a [
general election ](/en/government-in-ireland/elections-and-referenda/types-of-
elections-and-referendums/the-general-election/) at least every 5 years. There
is no minimum period for the duration of the Dáil.

The Taoiseach can ask the President to dissolve the Dáil at any time. The
President can only refuse to do this if the government does not have the
support of a majority in the Dáil.

A general election may also be called if:

  * The Taoiseach and government have lost a vote of no confidence in the Dáil. Under the [ Constitution of Ireland ](/en/government-in-ireland/irish-constitution-1/constitution-introduction/) , the Taoiseach and government must resign once a new government is formed. 
  * A coalition partner (a smaller party that joins a larger party to form a government) has withdrawn its support for the government. 

In both situations, opposition parties may be able to form a government and
elect a new Taoiseach without a general election taking place.

Once the Dáil has been dissolved, a general election must be held within 30
days.
