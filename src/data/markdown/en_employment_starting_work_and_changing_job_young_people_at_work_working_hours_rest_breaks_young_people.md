##  Young workers

The number of hours you can work and the types of jobs you can do, depends on
your age.

Young workers are people aged 14 to 18, who work for an employer. As young
workers are generally in full-time education, they are protected by different
employment laws than adults. This is to make sure their work does not put
their health or education at risk.

The working hours for young people are regulated by the [ Protection of Young
Persons (Employment) Act 1996.
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1996/en/act/pub/0016/index.html) The Act sets
maximum working hours, rest breaks from work and bans late night working for
young people under 18.

The Act applies to young people under 18. It defines children as being under
16 and young people are between 16 and 17. The Act does not apply to children
or young people who are employed by a close relative.
