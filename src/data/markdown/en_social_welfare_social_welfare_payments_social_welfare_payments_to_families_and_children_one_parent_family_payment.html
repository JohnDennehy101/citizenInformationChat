##  What is the One-Parent Family Payment?

The One-Parent Family Payment (OFP) is a payment for people under 66 who are
bringing children up without the support of a partner.

To get OFP, your children must be under a certain age.

You can work and get OFP. However, to get OFP your income must be below a
certain amount.

###  Extra Benefits

If you get the One-Parent Family Payment, you can use the [ Household Budget
Scheme ](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/claiming-a-social-
welfare-payment/household-budget-scheme/) to help you manage your bills.

You may also get other benefits such as:

  * [ Fuel Allowance ](/en/social-welfare/extra-social-welfare-benefits/fuel-allowance/)
  * [ Working Family Payment ](/en/social-welfare/families-and-children/working-family-payment/)
  * [ Medical card ](/en/health/medical-cards-and-gp-visit-cards/medical-card/)
  * [ Help with your rent ](/en/housing/renting-a-home/help-with-renting/housing-assistance-payment/)

[ Working Family Payment (WFP) ](/en/social-welfare/families-and-
children/working-family-payment/) is not included when your income is assessed
for OFP.

##  How to qualify for the One-Parent Family Payment

To qualify for the One-Parent Family Payment (OFP) you must:

  * Be aged under 66 
  * Be the parent, step-parent, adoptive parent or legal guardian of a child under a certain age (see ‘Age limit for a child’ below) 
  * Be the main carer of at least one child under the age limit. The child must live with you. OFP is not paid if the parents have joint equal custody of a child or children. 
  * Pass a means test. A means test looks at any income you have (see ‘How your income is assessed for the One-Parent Family Payment’ below) 
  * Live in Ireland and meet the [ habitual residence condition ](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/social-assistance-payments/habitual-residence-condition/) (read about [ exemptions from the habitual residency condition ](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/social-assistance-payments/habitual-residence-condition/) ) 
  * Not be living with a spouse, civil partner or [ cohabiting ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/birth-family-relationships/cohabiting-couples/rights-of-cohabiting-couples/#e6e823)

If you are **separated** , **divorced** or **your civil partnership is
dissolved** you must:

  * Have been living apart from your spouse or civil partner for at least 3 months. This does not apply to cohabitants (cohabitants are a couple living together, but not married or in a civil partnership) 
  * Be inadequately (not properly) [ maintained by your spouse or civil partner ](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/7e1920-operational-guidelines-liability-to-maintain-a-family/) (if your civil partner is the parent of the child) 

If your **spouse or civil partner is in prison** :

  * They must be sentenced to at least 6 months in prison, or have spent at least 6 months in custody. 

##  Age limit for a child

To get the One-Parent Family Payment (OFP) you must have at least one child
under 7 years of age.

###  Exceptions to the age limit

You may get OFP for a child aged 7 or over, in the following cases:

  * You are getting Domiciliary Care Allowance, half-rate Carer's Allowance or Blind Pension 
  * After the death of a spouse, partner or civil partner 

####  **Domiciliary Care Allowance**

If you are getting [ Domiciliary Care Allowance (DCA) ](/en/social-
welfare/disability-and-illness/domiciliary-care-allowance/) for a child, you
can get OFP until the child reaches 16 or the DCA stops. You must meet the
other qualifying conditions for OFP.

You will also get an Increase for a Qualified Child (IQC) for any other
children in the family until they reach 18 (or 22 if in full-time education)
while DCA and OFP are paid.

####  **Carer’s Allowance**

If you are getting OFP and providing full-time care and attention to one of
your children or for an adult (such as a sibling or a parent), you can keep
your OFP and also claim [ half-rate Carer’s Allowance ](/en/social-
welfare/carers/half-rate-carers-allowance/) , until your youngest child’s
turns 16. You must meet the conditions for both schemes.

You will also get an [ Increase for a Qualified Child (IQC) ](/en/social-
welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/claiming-a-social-welfare-
payment/claiming-and-increase-in-your-payment-for-a-child-dependant/) for any
other children in the family until they reach 18 (or 22 if in full-time
education) as long as you are getting Carer’s Allowance and OFP.

####  **Death of a spouse, partner or civil partner**

If you applied for the One-Parent Family Payment because you are parenting
alone following the death of your spouse, partner or civil partner, you may
get OFP for 2 years from the date of death. You cannot be paid OFP after your
youngest child reaches 18 even if it is less than 2 years after the date of
death.

####  **Blind Pension**

[ Blind Pension ](/en/social-welfare/disability-and-illness/blind-persons-
pension/) can be paid with OFP. This means that a person who qualifies for OFP
and Blind Pension can get both payments. You can get both Blind Pension and
OFP (and any IQCs paid with both Blind Pension and OFP) until your youngest
child turns 16.

###  What happens when my child is over the age limit?

Your OFP will stop when your youngest child reaches the age limit. The
Department of Social Protection (DSP) will tell you the end date for your
payment.

You may get the [ Jobseeker's Transitional payment ](/en/social-
welfare/unemployed-people/jobseekers-transitional-payment/) . This is a
payment for people parenting alone whose children are aged between 7 and 14
(the payment ends when the youngest child reaches 14).

You can find out more about [ what happens when your OFP ends ](/en/social-
welfare/families-and-children/moving-from-ofp/) .

You can also get information and advice about your options from:

  * Your local [ Intreo Centre or Social Welfare Branch Office ](https://www.gov.ie/en/directory/category/e1f4b5-intreo-offices/) , or 
  * Your local [ Citizens Information Centre ](http://centres.citizensinformation.ie/)

##  How income is assessed for the One-Parent Family Payment

One-Parent Family Payment (OFP) is a means-tested payment.

In a means test, the Department of Social Protection (DSP) examines all your
sources of income. To get OFP, your income must be below a certain amount.

You can check the latest version of the [ SW 19 Social Welfare Rates of
Payment booklet ](https://www.gov.ie/en/collection/1af6ca-rates-of-payment-
sw19/) for the amount of OFP payable with your means.

The main items included in the means test are:

###  **Cash income**

Some [ cash income may not be included in the means test ](/en/social-
welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/means-test-for-social-welfare-
payments/cash-income-not-included-in-the-social-welfare-means-test/) (see
‘Income from work’ below).

###  **Capital**

For example, the value of savings, investments, shares or any property you
have (but not your own home). The first €20,000 of your capital is not taken
into account.

Find out more about [ capital not included in the means test ](/en/social-
welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/means-test-for-social-welfare-
payments/how-to-assess-your-means-from-capital-for-social-welfare-payments/) .

###  **Maintenance**

The DSP also looks at maintenance paid to you. From 6 June 2024, child
maintenance payments are not included in the means test for One-Parent Family
Payment. Some other maintenance may not be included in the means test (see
‘Income from maintenance’ below).

###  **Income from work**

The first €165 of your gross weekly earnings (wages and profit from self-
employment) is not taken into account in the means test.

Half the remainder of your gross earnings per week is assessed as means and
you may get a reduced rate of OFP.

Social insurance contributions, superannuation/PRSA contributions and trade
union subscriptions are not taken into account when calculating your gross
earnings.

####  If your pay from work is reduced

You may get an increase in your One-Parent Family Payment (OFP) if your wages
are reduced. Send a current payslip (showing your reduced pay) with a letter
from your employer, confirming your new work hours and pay, to the Intreo
Centre or Social Welfare Branch Office dealing with your OFP.

If you are also getting the Working Family Payment (WFP), your WFP rate will
stay the same. However, if the number of hours you work is reduced to below 19
hours a week (38 hours a fortnight), you are no longer entitled to WFP.

If you are on the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP), you should contact your
local authority to find out if you can get a reduction in your weekly HAP rent
contribution. If you rent from a local authority or housing association you
should contact them to find out if you can get a reduction in your rent.

If you are not getting a [ medical card ](/en/health/medical-cards-and-gp-
visit-cards/medical-card/) or [ GP visit card ](/en/health/medical-cards-and-
gp-visit-cards/gp-visit-cards/) , you should find out if you now qualify.

###  **Income from maintenance**

Maintenance payments for you are assessed in the means test. However, child
maintenance payments are not included.

If you are getting maintenance from more than one person, all the payments are
added together and the total is assessed. However, only half of your income
from maintenance is assessed as means.

If you have housing costs, your rent or mortgage repayment up to a maximum of
€95.23 per week can be offset against maintenance payments. Half the balance
is then assessed as means. You must provide proof of rent or mortgage
payments.

Read more in our page about [ how maintenance is assessed as means
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-
system/means-test-for-social-welfare-payments/maintenance-and-social-welfare-
payments/) .

##  Education and training

You can keep your One-Parent Family Payment (OFP) if you are in education.

You may have the option to transfer to the [ Back to Education Allowance
(BTEA) ](/en/social-welfare/back-to-education/back-to-education-allowance/) or
to stay on your current payment and apply for a student grant. You need to
find out which option is of greatest benefit to you.

You cannot get BTEA and a student grant together. Find out more about [ social
welfare payments and student grants ](/en/social-welfare/back-to-
education/social-welfare-payments-and-the-student-grant/) .

###  **Childcare**

You can find out if any [ childcare supports ](/en/education/pre-school-
education-and-childcare/your-childcare-options/) are available to you while
studying, training or working.

##  Rate of the One-Parent Family Payment
