##  Introduction

Flu (also known as influenza) is a viral illness that affects your lungs and
upper airways. It is highly infectious and can lead to serious complications
for some people. However, an annual flu vaccine can help to protect you.

The [ 2024/2025 free flu vaccine programme ](https://www.gov.ie/en/press-
release/d3659-minister-for-health-announces-expanded-seasonal-flu-vaccination-
programme-for-20242025/) is extended to people aged 60 years and over. You can
read about the 2024-2025 flu vaccination programme below.

You can [ read more about the 2023/2024 HSE flu programme
](https://www2.hse.ie/conditions/flu/get-vaccine/%22%20/l%20%22who-can-get-a-
free-flu-vaccine) .

##  Can I get the flu vaccine?

You can get a free flu vaccine if you are:

  * [ Aged from 2 to 17 ](https://www.hse.ie/eng/health/immunisation/pubinfo/flu-vaccination/flu-vaccine-for-children/)
  * [ Aged 60 and over ](https://www.hse.ie/eng/health/immunisation/pubinfo/flu-vaccination/flu-65-and-over/)
  * A healthcare worker 
  * Pregnant 
  * Living in a nursing home or other long-term care facility 
  * In regular contact with pigs, poultry or waterfowl 
  * Aged over 6 months and have one of [ these medical conditions ](https://www2.hse.ie/screening-and-vaccinations/flu-vaccine/getting/#who-can-get-a-free-flu-vaccine)
  * A household contact or carer for somebody with underlying conditions or somebody who has Down Syndrome. 
  * The vaccine for children is given by nasal spray rather than injection. [ Read more about the flu vaccine for children aged 2 to 17. ](https://www2.hse.ie/conditions/flu/childrens-flu-vaccine/)

If you are eligible for a free flu vaccine, you will need to provide your PPS
number at your flu vaccine appointment.

You can get your [ COVID-19 booster ](/en/health/health-
services/vaccinations/vaccines-for-covid19/) and flu vaccine at the same time
if you are due a COVID-19 booster.

##  What is flu?

There are different types (or ‘strains’) of flu virus that go around each
year. You should get a new flu vaccine every flu season to make sure you are
protected. The flu season runs from October until April every year.

If you are infected with flu, you can spread it to other people by coughing or
sneezing. You can also spread flu by touching surfaces without washing your
hands.

You can infect other people from 1-2 days before your symptoms develop, and up
to 5 days after your [ symptoms
](https://www.hse.ie/eng/health/immunisation/pubinfo/flu-vaccination/about-
the-flu/#Flu%20and%20cold%20symptoms) develop. [ Read the differences between
the symptoms of flu and COVID-19.
](https://www2.hse.ie/conditions/flu/symptoms-diagnosis/)

###  Who is most at risk?

Flu can affect you at any age, but some people are more at risk and are
strongly advised to get the flu vaccine.

The flu vaccine is free for people that are more at risk (listed above).

##  How to get the flu vaccine

You can usually get your annual flu vaccine from your:

  * GP (family doctor) 
  * Local pharmacist (subject to availability) 
  * Occupational health department 

If you do not have a GP, you can [ find a GP in your area
](https://www2.hse.ie/services/find-a-gp/) .

##  When to get the flu vaccine

The flu vaccine is usually available from early October until late April every
year.

It will protect you against the most common strains of flu going around each
winter. As strains of flu change every year, you should get a new flu vaccine
every flu season.

When you get the flu vaccine, your immune system will start to produce
antibodies. Then, if you come into contact with the flu virus, these
antibodies will fight it and stop you from getting sick.

The flu vaccine does not contain live viruses – this means it cannot give you
flu.

##  Flu vaccine during pregnancy

If you are pregnant, you should get the flu vaccine as soon as possible. This
is because pregnant people are more at risk of complications from flu.

If you are pregnant through two flu seasons (for example, your pregnancy goes
from the end of one flu season to the beginning of another), you may need to
get two flu vaccines (one in each flu season). [ Read more about the flu
vaccine during pregnancy
](https://www.hse.ie/eng/health/immunisation/pubinfo/flu-vaccination/flu-
vaccine-pregnancy/) .

You may be able to get the flu vaccine on the same day as the [ whooping cough
vaccine ](/en/birth-family-relationships/before-your-baby-is-born/antenatal-
visits/) .

##  Cost of the flu vaccine

If you are in one of the [ at-risk groups
](https://www.hse.ie/eng/health/immunisation/pubinfo/flu-vaccination/about-
the-vaccine/#At-risk%20groups) , you can get your flu vaccine for free. This
includes people aged 60 and over, and children aged 2-17 for the 2024/2025 flu
season.

If you do not fall into one of these groups, check the cost with your GP or
pharmacist.
