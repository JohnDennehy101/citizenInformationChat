nationalities that are allowed to vote in elections and referendums in
Ireland.

  * Resident in Ireland **and**
  * [ Registered to vote ](/en/government-in-ireland/elections-and-referenda/voting/registering-to-vote/)

unless you are registered on the _Register of Electors_ . You can [ check the
register ](https://www.checktheregister.ie/en-IE/) to see if you are

oireachtas/the-seanad/) , you must be an Irish citizen who is:

  * A graduate of the [ National University of Ireland ](http://www.nui.ie/elections/seanad.asp) (or an [ NUI recognised college ](http://www.nui.ie/elections/docs/institutions.pdf) ) or

  * An outgoing member of the Seanad 
  * A [ member of a county or city council ](/en/government-in-ireland/how-government-works/local-and-regional-government/functions-of-local-authorities/) (a councillor)

constituencies, even if you are resident outside Ireland.

##  British citizens

British citizens who live in Ireland can vote in:

  * [ General elections ](/en/government-in-ireland/elections-and-referenda/types-of-elections-and-referendums/the-general-election/)
  * [ Local elections ](/en/government-in-ireland/elections-and-referenda/types-of-elections-and-referendums/local-elections/)

British citizens are identified by the letter **'D** ' on the Register of

##  European Union citizens

Citizens of the EU who live in Ireland can vote in:

If you are an EU citizen, other than an Irish citizen, and you were not
registered to vote in previous European elections in Ireland, you must also
complete a declaration on form EP1 (available from your local authority). This
is to guard against double voting in European elections. The local authority
will send the information in your declaration to your country of nationality.

You must be registered at one address only. If you move away from the address
at which you are registered, you will need to contact the local authority and
give them your new address.

If you leave your address but you plan to return there within 18 months, you
can continue to be registered there, as long you do not register at any other
address.

EU citizens are identified by the letter **‘E’** on the Register of Electors.

##  Non-EU citizens

Citizens from outside the European Union can vote in:

  * [ Local elections ](/en/government-in-ireland/elections-and-referenda/types-of-elections-and-referendums/local-elections/)

You can vote in a local election if you are a non-EU citizen, regardless of
the type of residence you hold, or if you are [ seeking asylum ](/en/moving-
country/asylum-seekers-and-refugees/the-asylum-process-in-ireland/rights-and-
obligations-of-asylum-seekers-in-ireland/) and have not had a decision on your
application.

Non-EU citizens are identified by the letter ' **L** ' on the Register of
Electors.

##  What happens if my citizenship changes?

If your citizenship changes, you should update your details on the Register of
Electors.

If you become an Irish citizen, and you are already registered to vote, you
should complete [ form ERF1 ](https://www.checktheregister.ie/en-IE/forms) to
add your new citizenship details to the Register of Electors. You will need to
supply proof that you are now an Irish citizen (either a copy of your
naturalisation certificate, or a copy of the photo page of your Irish
passport).
