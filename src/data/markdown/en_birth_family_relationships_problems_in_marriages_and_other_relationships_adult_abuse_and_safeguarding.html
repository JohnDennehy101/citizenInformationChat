##  What is adult abuse?

Adult abuse happens when a person’s rights, independence or dignity are not
respected. This can be deliberate, or it can be caused by a lack of knowledge,
or omission of care. However, all circumstances of not respecting a person’s
rights are abusive.

Abuse can affect any adult at any stage of life and any person is at risk. It
is more likely to happen when people are more vulnerable – for example people
living with, a physical or intellectual disability, an acquired brain injury,
a mental health condition, or in situations of coercive control or frailty due
to age. A vulnerable person is someone who is not able to protect themselves
from harm or exploitation, or their ability to report instances of harm or
exploitation may be limited.

Abuse can be perpetrated (carried out) by a range of people, such as
strangers, institutions, or family members. It may happen when an older person
or a person with a disability lives alone or with a relative. It may also
happen in residential or day-care settings, in hospitals, home support
services and other places assumed to be safe.

[ Elder abuse ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/birth-family-
relationships/older-people/elder-abuse/) is the abuse of someone aged 65 or
over and it happens in a relationship where there is an expectation of trust.
For information on recognising the signs of child abuse, and the protection of
vulnerable children, see our page [ Child abuse and child protection.
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/birth-family-relationships/services-
and-supports-for-children/child-abuse-and-protection/)

Financial or material abuse  |  Theft, fraud, exploitation, pressure in connection with wills, property or inheritance, or financial transactions, or the misuse or misappropriation of property, possessions or benefits   
Neglect  |  Self-neglect and acts of omission including ignoring medical or physical care needs, the withholding of the necessities of life, such as medication, adequate nutrition and heating   
Discriminatory abuse  |  Ageism, racism, sexism, abuse based on a person’s disability, and other forms of harassment, slurs or similar treatment   
Institutional abuse  |  Poor standards of care, rigid routines, inadequate responses to complex needs occurring in residential care, nursing homes, acute hospitals, and in-patient settings   
Sexual abuse  |  Rape and sexual assault or sexual acts to which the older adult has not consented, or could not consent, or into which they were forced to consent

](https://www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/2/healthcentres/) , your GP, [ public
health nurse ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/health/health-
services/care-in-your-community/public-health-nurses/) or the [ Garda Síochana
](https://www.garda.ie/en/contact-us/station-directory/) .

Alternatively, call the [ HSE’s National Safeguarding Office
](https://www.hse.ie/eng/about/who/socialcare/safeguardingvulnerableadults/safeguardingvuladts.html)
at (061) 461 358. The HSE has [ Safeguarding and Protection Teams

safeguarding@welfare.ie ](mailto:safeguarding@welfare.ie) , or call 071 919

##  Safeguarding your future

Safeguarding risks arise if an adult is prevented from making their own
decisions. Every person is presumed to have the right to make their own
decisions unless deemed not to have capacity, which requires certification by
a healthcare professional.

Safeguarding your future means planning to help reduce the risk of abuse. You
can:

**Choose who can assist you with making decisions**

The [ Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/health/legal-matters-and-
health/assisted-decision-making-act/) is a new law that supports the rights of
people to make their own decisions. [ Decision support arrangements
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/health/legal-matters-and-
health/decision-support-arrangements/) are legally recognised arrangements for
people who need support to make certain decisions. There are 3 types of
support arrangements for people who currently, or may shortly, face challenges
when making certain decisions:

  * [ Decision-making assistance agreement ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/health/legal-matters-and-health/decision-making-assistance-agreement/)
  * [ Co-decision-making agreement ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/health/legal-matters-and-health/co-decision-making-agreement/)
  * [ Decision-making representation order ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/health/legal-matters-and-health/decision-making-representative-order/)

The [ Decision Support Service ](https://www.decisionsupportservice.ie/) has
published an easy-to-read guide on the [ Assisted Decision-Making Capacity Act
2015 (pdf)
](https://decisionsupportservice.ie/sites/default/files/2023-05/DSS%20Easy%20Read%20-%2026%20May%202023.pdf)
and [ My Choices: Getting support to make decisions (pdf)
](https://decisionsupportservice.ie/sites/default/files/2023-04/10919%20MHC%20DSS%20My%20choices%20-%20screen.pdf)
.

**Make an Enduring Power of Attorney**

Make and register an [ Enduring Power of Attorney
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/death/before-a-death/power-of-
attorney/) . This is a legal arrangement that gives authority to a person you
know and trust, to act on your behalf if you lose the capacity to make certain
decisions in the future. These decisions can be about your personal welfare
and property and money matters. For more information, Safeguarding Ireland has
a leaflet that explains [ how an Enduring Power of Attorney can safeguard your
finances, property and welfare (pdf) ](https://www.safeguardingireland.org/wp-
content/uploads/2022/09/6466-SI-Planning-Ahead-A5-FA-web.pdf) .

**Choose a Health Representative**

Make an [ Advance Healthcare Directive
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/health/legal-matters-and-
health/advance-care-directives/) . This arrangement lets you set out your
wishes about healthcare and medical treatment decisions in case you are unable
to make these decisions at some time in the future. You can appoint someone
you know and trust as your designated healthcare representative to ensure your
advance healthcare directive is followed. For more information, the Decision
Support Service has published [ Your guide to an Advance Healthcare Directive
(pdf)
](https://decisionsupportservice.ie/sites/default/files/2023-09/10922%20MHC%20DSS%20Your%20Guide%20to%20an%20Advance%20Healthcare%20Directive%20-%20screen.pdf)
