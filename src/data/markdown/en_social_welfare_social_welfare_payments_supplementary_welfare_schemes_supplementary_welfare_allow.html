##  What is Supplementary Welfare Allowance?

Basic Supplementary Welfare Allowance is a weekly allowance paid to people who
do not have enough income to meet their needs or the needs of their family.

##  Who can get Supplementary Welfare Allowance?

If you have no income, you may get a basic Supplementary Welfare Allowance
(SWA).

If your weekly income is below the Supplementary Welfare Allowance rate for
your family size, a payment may be made to bring your income up to the
Supplementary Welfare Allowance rate for your family.

If you applied for a social welfare payment or pension but it has not yet been
paid and you have no other income, you may get SWA while you are waiting for
your payment. However, the amount paid while you are waiting will be deducted
from the arrears of your social welfare payment.

If you have returned to work, you can claim the basic SWA for up to 30 days
while you are waiting for your wages.

####  People from Ukraine

[ People who have come from Ukraine ](/en/moving-country/asylum-seekers-and-
refugees/the-asylum-process-in-ireland/coming-to-ireland-from-ukraine/) and
who are covered by the [ Temporary Protection Directive
](https://ec.europa.eu/home-affairs/policies/migration-and-asylum/common-
european-asylum-system/temporary-protection_en) can get Supplementary Welfare
Allowance.

##  Rules for getting Supplementary Welfare Allowance

You may get Supplementary Welfare Allowance if you:

  * Are living in the State. 
  * Pass the means test - see 'How your income is assessed for Supplementary Welfare Allowance' below 
  * Have applied for any other social welfare benefit or allowance you may be entitled to 
  * Have registered for work with your local Intreo Centre - if you are of working age 
  * Meet the [ habitual residence condition (HRC) ](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/social-assistance-payments/habitual-residence-condition/) \- see below for exceptions to the HRC 

You will _not_ normally qualify for basic SWA if you are:

  * In full-time work, that is, working for 30 hours or more per week*. 
  * In full-time education. 
  * Involved in a trade dispute. However, you can claim SWA for your dependants. 

* This condition does not apply to your spouse, civil partner or cohabitant. However, any income they have from work is taken into account in the means test. 

###  Habitual Residency Condition

EU/EEA and Swiss migrant workers who have been working in Ireland and have the
right to reside here can access basic SWA and supplements without having to
meet the habitual residency condition.

However, people from the EU/EEA or Switzerland who move to Ireland in search
of employment are subject to the habitual residence condition in the normal
way while looking for work.

##  How your income is assessed for Supplementary Welfare Allowance

SWA is a means-tested payment.

In a means test the Department of Social Protection examines all your sources
of income. To get SWA, your income must be below a certain amount.

If you are married, in a civil partnership or cohabiting, the total income of
the couple is added together in the means test.

The main items included in the means test are:

  * **Cash income** that you or your spouse, civil partner or cohabitant may have. For example, maintenance (except child maintenance), income from employment and income from self-employment. 
  * **Capital** , for example, the value of savings, investments, shares or any property you have (but not your own home). The first €5,000 of your capital is not taken into account. 

###  **Cash income**

Most social welfare and Health Service Executive payments are taken into
account in the means test – see payments not taken into account below.

Generally, all financial compensation is taken into account. However, certain
types of compensation are not assessed as income. You can find a [ list of
compensation payments not assessed as income ](/en/social-welfare/irish-
social-welfare-system/means-test-for-social-welfare-payments/cash-income-not-
included-in-the-social-welfare-means-test/) .

The following payments are **not** taken into account:

  * Child Benefit, Domiciliary Care Allowance, Blind Welfare Allowance, Guardian's Payment (Contributory), Guardian's Payment (Non-Contributory) and the Carer's Support Grant. 
  * [ Foster care allowance ](/en/birth-family-relationships/adoption-and-fostering/fostering/)
  * The [ Consumer Directed Home Support (CDHS) ](/en/health/health-services/health-services-for-older-people/home-support-service/) from the HSE 
  * [ Maintenance grants paid by SUSI ](/en/education/third-level-education/fees-and-supports-for-third-level-education/student-grant-scheme/)
  * Payments under the Department of Education's school transport scheme for children with special educational needs 
  * Payments under the 1916 Bursary Fund from the Department of Education 
  * University payments made under the [ Higher Education Scholarships for Adult Learners ](https://www.uversity.org/) of up to a maximum of €7000 per year 
  * Scholarship payments under UCD’s Cothrom na Féine Scholarship Programme of up to €7000 per year 
  * Payments made by Sport Ireland under the International Carding Scheme 
  * Up to €165 of earnings from employment for people who have applied for, or are getting, Disability Allowance or Blind Pension 
  * Payments made under the [ Mother and Baby Institutions Payment Scheme ](/en/birth-family-relationships/adoption-and-fostering/mother-and-baby-institutions-payment-scheme/)
  * Payments made to people who experienced sexual abuse as a pupil in a recognised day school, before the [ Guidelines for Procedures for Dealing with Allegations or Suspicions of Child Abuse ](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/ef0a6-guidelines-for-procedures-for-dealing-with-allegations-or-suspicions-of-child-abuse/) , and who took legal action against the State as a result 
  * Certain income from rent is not included in the means test – see ‘Income from rent’ below 

###  **Capital**

**The value of investments, savings or property** (but not the value of your
own home) is calculated as follows:

Capital  |  Weekly means assessed   
---|---  
First €5,000  |  not taken into account   
Next €10,000  |  €1 per €1,000   
Next €25,000  |  €2 per €1,000   
Balance  |  €4 per €1,000   
  
###  **Living with your parent**

If you are **24 years of age or under** and you are living with a parent or a
step-parent in the family home, some of your parents' income will also be
taken into account in the assessment for Supplementary Welfare Allowance.

The Department of Social Protection calls this an assessment of the 'benefit
and privilege' you get from living with your parents.

###  Income from rent

You can get up to [ €14,000 per year for renting out a room in your own home
](https://www.gov.ie/en/press-release/4bf45-minister-humphreys-announces-
measures-to-remove-barriers-facing-social-welfare-customers-seeking-to-take-
in-tenants/) without it affecting your Supplementary Welfare Allowance.

The maximum income disregard is €269.23 a week (€14,000 per year).

From 1 December 2023, you can benefit from this income disregard if you are [
a Local Authority tenant and you rent out a room to a third-level student
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/housing/owning-a-home/home-
owners/renting-out-a-room-in-your-home/#1e7720) under the ‘Room for a Student
Local Authority Tenancies Scheme’.

From 1 February 2024, you can benefit from this income disregard if you move
out of your home under the [ Nursing Homes Support Scheme (Fair Deal)
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/health/health-services/health-
services-for-older-people/fair-deal-scheme/) .

####  **Rules about renting the room**

The person renting a room in your home must use the room for a minimum of 28
consecutive days. The income disregard will not apply if you are renting to an
employee or to your immediate family members.

Immediate family members are:

  * Your spouse, civil partner or partner 
  * Your child, or the spouse of your child 
  * Your parent, step-parent or parent-in-law 
  * Your sibling, including step-siblings or siblings-in-law 
  * Your grandparent or your grandchild 
  * Your aunt or uncle 
  * Your nephew or niece 

####  **If you host people coming from Ukraine**

The [ Accommodation Recognition Payment ](/en/moving-country/ukrainian-
refugees-in-ireland/accommodation-recognition-payment/) for hosting refugees
from Ukraine is not assessed in the means test for Supplementary Welfare
Allowance.

##  Rate of Supplementary Welfare Allowance

for you (the applicant) and additional amounts for any adult dependant and
child dependant.

A child dependant is a person under the age of 18 who lives with you and
depends on you for financial support. If you have been getting SWA for at
least 26 weeks, the age limit is 22 for a child dependant in full-time
education or up to the end of the academic year after their 22nd birthday.
