#  Types of insurance

  * Introduction 
  * Complaints 
  * Further information 

##  Introduction

Insurance is a way of protecting yourself from costs due to damage to your
property or your health. A premium is the amount of money you pay to an
insurance company to have an insurance policy to cover you for all or part of
these costs. Insurance companies assess the risk on a particular policy and
then calculate the premium to be charged. You can pay a premium monthly or
annually. The Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC) has [
information that explains how different types of insurance work
](https://www.ccpc.ie/consumers/money/insurance/) .

Insurance policies are generally renewed once a year. Coming up to renewal
date, you should shop around to see if you are getting the best value for
money.

Different policies have different terms and conditions so make sure you know
what the terms and conditions of your policy are. It is important to
understand exactly what your insurance policy covers when you buy it.

###  Home insurance

You are not obliged by law to insure your home but if you have a mortgage most
lenders will insist that your house is properly insured. In general, your
insurance should cover contents as well as the structure of your home.
However, you can get insurance for the contents of your home separately from
insurance for the building, for example, if you are renting and do not own
your home. The CCPC has [ detailed information on home insurance
](https://www.ccpc.ie/consumers/money/insurance/home-insurance/) .

###  Mortgage protection insurance

When taking out a mortgage, you need to think about how it will be paid off if
you die. You will generally be required to take out mortgage protection
insurance. You should also think about how to continue repayments if your
income falls, due to illness, unemployment or other reasons. You can [ find
out more about insurance protection on mortgages ](/en/housing/owning-a-
home/buying-a-home/insurance-protection-on-mortgages/) .

###  Motor insurance

It is a criminal offence for drivers to drive uninsured on public roads in
Ireland. You can [ find out more about motor insurance ](/en/travel-and-
recreation/motoring/motor-tax-and-insurance/motor-insurance/) .

###  Health insurance

Health insurance is used to pay for private care in hospital or from various
health professionals in hospitals or in their practices. There are several
health insurers in Ireland. You can [ find out more about health insurance
](/en/health/health-system/private-health-insurance/) .

###  Travel insurance

Travel insurance can cover you if you become ill or have an accident while you
are on holidays or travelling.

If you are travelling within the [ EEA
](https://www2.hse.ie/services/ehic/countries-in-the-eu-and-eea.html) or
Switzerland, you should have a [ European Health Insurance Card
](http://www.ehic.ie/) which allows you to access health care services. In
general, travel insurance should supplement the services available to people
with a European Health Insurance Card.

You can [ find out more about travel insurance
](https://www.ccpc.ie/consumers/money/insurance/travel-insurance) and other [
things to consider when travelling abroad ](/en/travel-and-recreation/travel-
abroad/travelling-abroad-during-covid/) .

###  Life insurance

A life insurance policy can provide money for dependants if you die. The CCPC
has detailed [ information about life insurance
](https://www.ccpc.ie/consumers/money/insurance/life-insurance/) .  

##  Complaints

If you have any problems with an insurer, you should first take this up with
the customer service department of the insurer (or your broker/agent if you
are using one). The [ Central Bank of Ireland ](/en/consumer/financial-
products/your-rights-when-buying-financial-products/) enforces the [ Consumer
Protection Code ](https://www.centralbank.ie/regulation/consumer-
protection/consumer-protection-codes-regulations#unofficial-consolidation) for
financial services providers (including insurers and intermediaries). The code
sets out how they deal with their customers.

If you are not satisfied with how a financial services provider is dealing
with you, or you believe that they are not following the principles or rules
of the Code, you should first complain to the provider. Under the Code,
financial services providers must have a complaints procedure in place and
must handle your complaint speedily, efficiently and fairly. There are
detailed rules in the Code about how often a firm should contact you to keep
you updated on your complaint. You can read more about the rules around how
firms must handle complaints in the Central Bank of Ireland's [ consumer guide
to the Code (pdf) ](https://www.centralbank.ie/docs/default-
source/regulation/industry-market-sectors/brokers-retail-
intermediaries/guidance/consumer-protection-code-v4.pdf) .

If you cannot resolve your problem or if you are not satisfied with how your
complaint is being handled, you can take your complaint to the [ Financial
Services and Pensions Ombudsman ](https://www.fspo.ie/) . The Ombudsman is an
independent, statutory body that can investigate your complaint.

[ Insurance Ireland ](http://www.insuranceireland.eu/) provides consumer
information and [ a free Insurance Information Service (IIS)
](http://www.insuranceireland.eu/consumer-information/insurance-information-
service) for members of the public. The IIS can help you if you want
information about insurance, or if you need help in resolving a problem with
your insurance company. This service will also investigate complaints that
fall outside the scope of the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman.

The Competition and Consumer Protection Commission gives information and
advice about [ making insurance claims
](https://www.ccpc.ie/consumers/money/insurance/making-an-insurance-claim/)
and [ complaints about financial service providers
](https://www.ccpc.ie/consumers/how-to-complain/complaints-about-financial-
services-providers/) .
