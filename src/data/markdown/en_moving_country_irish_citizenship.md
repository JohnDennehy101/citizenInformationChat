What is Irish citizenship and who can become an Irish citizen?

  * [ Irish citizenship through birth or descent ](/en/moving-country/irish-citizenship/irish-citizenship-through-birth-or-descent/)

You are not automatically an Irish citizen if you were born on the island of
Ireland. You may be entitled to Irish citizenship if your parent(s) or
grandparents were Irish. You may be entitled to Irish citizenship if you were
born outside of Ireland, but you may need to register your birth.

  * [ Becoming an Irish citizen through naturalisation ](/en/moving-country/irish-citizenship/becoming-an-irish-citizen-through-naturalisation/)

Naturalisation is the process through which a foreign national can become an
Irish citizen. Find out more about who is eligible to become an Irish citizen
through naturalisation and how to apply.

  * [ The Foreign Births Register ](/en/moving-country/irish-citizenship/foreign-births-register/)

If your grandparents were born in Ireland, but you were born abroad, your
birth must be registered in the Foreign Births Register to claim Irish
citizenship. This document explains how to do this.
