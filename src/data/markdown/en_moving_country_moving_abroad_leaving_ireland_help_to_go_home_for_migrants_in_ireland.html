##  What help can I get to leave Ireland?

You can get help to return to your home country if you do not have permission
to remain in Ireland. This is known as ‘voluntary return’.

The [ voluntary return programme ](https://www.irishimmigration.ie/my-
situation-has-changed-since-i-arrived-in-ireland/voluntary-returns/) can give
you financial and other support.

It can help you to return to your home country or another country where you
can legally stay.

This programme may be for you, if any of the following apply to you:

  * You are in Ireland illegally 
  * You have withdrawn your application for international protection 
  * You have been refused [ international protection ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/moving-country/asylum-seekers-and-refugees/the-asylum-process-in-ireland/if-your-application-for-refugee-status-is-refused/)
  * You have been notified that you will get a deportation order 

##  Why should I leave Ireland voluntarily?

If you want to return to Ireland or the EU in the future, it is a good idea to
leave Ireland voluntarily rather than be deported.

###  Leaving Ireland voluntarily

If you leave voluntarily, you travel like any other passenger. You can legally
return to Ireland or another EU country in the future.

###  Getting deported

If you are deported from Ireland:

  * The authorities in your home country may be told that you are being deported. 
  * You may not be able to return to Ireland or any country within the EU. Deportation can mean a lifetime ban on entry to Ireland and the EU. 

##  Can I get help from the voluntary return programme?

You can use the voluntary return programme, if any of the following apply to
you.

  * You are in Ireland illegally 
  * You have withdrawn your application for international protection 
  * You have been refused [ international protection ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/moving-country/asylum-seekers-and-refugees/the-asylum-process-in-ireland/if-your-application-for-refugee-status-is-refused/)
  * You have been notified that you will get a deportation order 
  * You are victim of trafficking in Ireland 

You cannot use the voluntary return scheme, if you have already received a
deportation order.

##  What help can I get?

If you leave Ireland voluntarily, you may get financial help, if you need it.

You can get help with the cost of your:

  * Travel to the airport 
  * Flights 
  * Transit visas and food costs 
  * Medical appointments, medication and travel documentation 

You may also get a ‘reintegration grant’ to help you to settle back home.

###  What is the reintegration grant?

The reintegration grant is available to some people who apply to voluntarily
return to their country of origin. For example, the grant can help you to
access education or set up a small business when you return to your home
country.

The reintegration grant provides:

  * €1200 for one person 
  * €2000 for a couple or family 

You can discuss your needs with the Voluntary Return Unit to find out what
financial support you can get.

##  How do I apply for the voluntary return scheme?

To apply for the voluntary return scheme, you can:

##  Leaving Ireland without help

If you leave Ireland without the help of the voluntary returns programme, you
must tell the [ Voluntary Returns Unit of the Department of Justice
](https://www.irishimmigration.ie/my-situation-has-changed-since-i-arrived-in-
ireland/voluntary-returns/#who-do-I-contact) so they can close your case and
stop you getting a deportation order.

You can get a deportation order even if you have left Ireland. If you don’t
tell the Department that you have left Ireland, your case will stay open, and
you will be issued with a deportation order.
