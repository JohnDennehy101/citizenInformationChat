#  Worksheet for calculating Rent Supplement

  * Worksheet 

##  Worksheet

There are 6 steps to calculating your Rent Supplement.

Use the page ‘ [ Calculating Rent Supplement ](/en/social-
welfare/supplementary-welfare-schemes/calculating-rent-supplement/) ’ with
this worksheet.

**Step 1:** Calculate your _gross assessable weekly income_ from all sources.

**Income source** |  **Claimant** |  **Spouse/Partner/Cohabitant**  
---|---|---  
Social welfare payments (note that some payments, such as Child Benefit, are not counted or _disregarded_ )  |  |   
Income from employment or training schemes  |  |   
Education and Training Board (ETB) training allowances  |  |   
Gross income from employment or self-employment  |  |   
Working Family Payment (was called Family Income Supplement)  |  |   
Maintenance (except child maintenance, which is not taken into account)  |  |   
Means from capital (for example, property, savings and investments)  |  |   
Other means (including occupational or foreign pensions)  |  |   
_Total gross assessable weekly income_ |   
  
**Step 2:** Find out what your _income in excess of the_ [ _Supplementary
Welfare Allowance (SWA)_ ](/en/social-welfare/supplementary-welfare-
schemes/supplementary-welfare-allow/) _rate_ is.

To do this, you deduct the Over 65 disregard, the carer’s disregard, travel
costs, PRSI and the appropriate SWA rate for your circumstances from your
gross assessable income to find out what your _income in excess of the SWA
rate_ is.

_Total gross assessable weekly income_ (final figure from Step 1 above)  |  €.................   
---|---  
Subtract Over 65 disregard  |   
Subtract Carer’s disregard  |   
Subtract travel costs to work  |   
Subtract PRSI  |   
Subtract appropriate SWA rate  |   
_Income in excess of SWA rate_ |   
  
**Step 3:** Calculate the _Additional income disregard_ or the _Disability
Allowance (DA)/Blind Pension (BP) earnings disregard._

This step does not apply if you have no additional income, or you are not
working and getting DA or BP.

Additional income = **(A+B) - C** where  |  €...............   
---|---  
**A** = Gross income from:  Training or employment schemes  Full or part-time work  Working Family Payment  Maintenance over €95.23 a week (excluding child maintenance)  |   
**Total A:** |   
**B** = assessable income from other sources:  Carer’s Allowance/Benefit  Occupational pensions  Foreign pensions  All other DSP payments including pensions (total)  Income from leased farm or land  Other income  Means from capital  Subtract Carer’s disregard (to get this: subtract SWA rate (either IQA rate or single rate) from actual carer's payment)  Subtract Over 65 disregard (to get this: State Pension (Contributory) rate minus SWA rate)  |   
**Total B:** |   
**C** = SWA rate for family circumstances  |   
**Total C:** |   
(A+B) – C = Additional Income  |   
Subtract PRSI, pension contributions, income continuance  |   
_Additional Income for disregard_ |   
If _Additional Income for disregard_ is less than or equal to €75 this figure is the Additional income disregard.  If not, do this calculation:  |   
Subtract €75  |   
**Subtotal** |   
25% of subtotal  |   
Add €75 + 25% of subtotal to get _Additional Income disregard_ |   
_Disability Allowance and Blind Pension earnings disregard_ |  €.................   
---|---  
This is €165, if you are getting Disability Allowance or Blind Pension and your income from work is less than €165, use the actual figure  |   
  
**Step 4:** Subtract the _Additional Income disregard_ or the _Disability
Allowance/Blind Pension earnings disregard_ (choose the most beneficial one if
both could apply to you) from your _income in excess of the SWA rate_ (figure
at the end of Step 2). This figure is your _contribution from means_ .

Subtract _Additional Income disregard_ from _income in excess of SWA rate_ (from Step 2) or  Subtract _Disability Allowance/Blind Pension earnings disregard_ from _income in excess of SWA rate_ (from Step 2)  |  €.................   
---|---  
_Contribution from means_ (this is the figure at the end of Step 2 if you have no additional income or you are not working and getting DA or BP)  |   
  
**Step 5:** Find your _total weekly contribution to rent_ by adding your
_contribution from means_ to your _minimum Household Contribution_ .

If there are other non-dependent members of the household their contribution
is included at this stage.

_Contribution from means_ |  €.................   
---|---  
Add _Minimum Household contribution_ (€30 for a single person and €40 for a couple)  |   
Add _Contribution from others_ |   
_Total weekly contribution to rent_ |   
  
**Step 6:** Find your Rent Supplement payment by subtracting your _total
weekly contribution to your rent_ from your weekly rent.

Weekly rent (monthly rent x 12 ÷ 52)  |   
---|---  
Less _your total weekly contribution to rent_ |   
_Total Rent Supplement payable_ |
