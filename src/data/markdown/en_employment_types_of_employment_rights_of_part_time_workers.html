##  Introduction

If you work part-time, you have the right to be treated fairly compared to
your full-time co-workers.

The rights of part-time employees are protected in law. You cannot generally
be treated _less favourably_ – in other words, you must be treated **at least
as well as** comparable full-time employees.

Read more below on ‘ [ the laws on part-time work ](/en/employment/types-of-
employment/employment-rights-of-part-time-workers#l18218) ’.

##  What a part-time worker is

You are a part-time worker if you work less hours than a _comparable_ full-
time worker doing the same type of work.

A comparable full-time worker works for the same employer as you, **and
either** :

  * Does the same job in the same or similar conditions 
  * Is capable of substituting or temporarily replacing you in performing the work 
  * Does the same or similar work with only minor variations in responsibilities and working conditions 
  * Does work of equal or lower value than yours 

For example, a part-time sales assistant can compare themselves to a full-time
sales assistant who is doing the same job, in the same shop.

###  **Agency workers**

Part-time agency workers can only compare themselves to comparable full-time
agency workers. They cannot compare themselves to full-time permanent workers.

###  **Casual workers**

A casual worker is a part-time worker who works on a casual basis. Casual
workers are normally on standby to do work as required without fixed hours or
attendance arrangements.

You are a casual worker if you have less than 13 continuous weeks’ service,
are not in regular or seasonal employment, or are casual based on a collective
agreement.

###  **Job-sharing**

If you job-share, you are a part-time worker and have all the legal
entitlements of part-time workers.

###  **Flexible working**

Flexible hours and other flexible working arrangements are generally at the
discretion of your employer and are not covered by specific legislation.

##  Less favourable treatment

Employers cannot treat a part-time employee less favourably compared to full-
time employees, unless there are valid, objective reasons for doing so (known
as _objective justification_ or _objective grounds_ ).

You can be treated less favourably in relation to pensions, but only in very
specific circumstances – see below.

###  **What are objective grounds for different treatment?**

Employers can treat you less favourably if they have _objective grounds_ .
This means the difference in treatment is appropriate and necessary for a
legitimate business purpose.

An example of objective grounds could be not providing you with health
insurance, even though full-time workers get health insurance. This could be
justified because it’s more costly for your employer to provide insurance to
part-time employees.

Objective grounds for treating part-time workers less favourably than full-
time workers may be different for _casual_ part-time employees.

###  Pensions and part-time workers

Part-time workers should generally have the same access to pension benefits.

However, if you work less than 20% of the normal hours of full-time employees,
your employer does not have to give you the same pension benefits as the full-
time employee.

However, your employer can choose to give you the same pension benefits as a
full-time worker if they want to.

##  Paying tax, PRSI and USC

You may have to pay taxes and social contributions, depending on how much you
earn.

###  **PAYE**

PAYE is an _income tax_ , which is deducted from your wages by your employer
using Revenue’s ‘ [ Pay As You Earn
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/money-and-tax/tax/income-tax/how-your-
tax-is-calculated/) ’ system.

The rate of tax you pay depends on:

  * Your income or salary, and 
  * Your _tax credits_ (tax credits reduce the amount of income tax you must pay) 

Read about [ how your income tax is calculated
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/money-and-tax/tax/income-tax/how-your-
tax-is-calculated/) . If your tax credits are more than your _gross tax_ (your
total tax due), you do not have to pay any income tax.

Read about [ starting work for the first time
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/employment/starting-work-and-changing-
job/starting-work/tax-and-starting-work/) and avoiding emergency tax.

###  **PRSI**

PRSI is your ‘Pay Related Social Insurance’ (also called your _social
insurance contributions_ ). The amount of PRSI you pay is based on your
earnings and the type of work you do.

Read about [ part-time work and social insurance (PRSI)
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-
system/social-insurance-prsi/part-time-work-and-social-insurance-prsi/) .

###  **USC**

The [ Universal Social Charge (USC)
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/money-and-tax/tax/income-
tax/universal-social-charge/) is tax you pay on _gross income_ (this is your
total pay before any money is deducted, including your basic salary and any
overtime, commission or bonus).

If you earn more than €13,000 a year, you pay USC on your full income.

You do not pay any USC if your total income is €13,000 or less a year.

##  Part-time hours and overtime

You are entitled to overtime pay if your full-time co-workers are paid
overtime.

However, your employer can decide that you must work the same number of hours
as a full-time employee before you are entitled to overtime pay.

###  **Example**

Your full-time co-workers must work 39 hours a week before they get overtime
pay. Your employer can decide that part-time employees must also work 39 hours
before getting overtime pay.

If you typically work 20 hours a week, you will be paid at your normal rate
for hours worked between 20 and 39 hours. Any hours you work beyond 39 hours
will be paid at an overtime rate.

By law, employers don’t have to pay higher rates like ‘double time’ for
overtime. However, they must pay at least the normal hourly rate for overtime
hours worked.

##  Switching to part-time

If you are a full-time worker and you want to switch to part-time, you have
the right to ask your employer. Your employer does not have to agree, but they
should think about ways to make part-time work accessible to employees. Read
the WRC’s [ Code of Practice on Access to Part-Time Work
](https://www.workplacerelations.ie/en/what_you_should_know/codes_practice/cop7/)
.

Your employer should consider your request for part-time working without
discrimination, in line with [ employment equality legislation
](http://www.ihrec.ie/publications/list/ihrec-employment-equality-rights-
explained/) .

###  **New right to request flexible working**

Since 7 March 2024, you have a new [ right to request a flexible working
arrangement ](/en/employment/employment-rights-and-conditions/hours-of-
work/right-to-request-flexible-working/) if you are a parent or carer.

You can request flexible working from your first day in a new job but must
have 6 months of continuous service before the arrangement can start.

For full practical guidance for employers and employees on making and handling
requests for flexible working arrangements, you can read the Workplace
Relations Commission’s (WRC) [ Code of Practice for Employers and Employees on
the Right to Request Flexible Working and Right to Request Remote Working
](https://www.workplacerelations.ie/en/what_you_should_know/codes_practice/code-
of-practice-for-employers-and-employees-right-to-request-flexible-working-and-
right-to-request-remote-
working/request%20flexible%20working%20and%20right%20to%20request%20remote%20working.html)
.

###  **Can I work part-time after taking parental leave?**

You are entitled to ask for a change in your work pattern or working hours for
a set period when you return to work after taking [ parental leave
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/employment/employment-rights-and-
conditions/leave-and-holidays/parental-leave/) .

Your employer must consider your request and give you a response **within 4
weeks** , but they don’t have to accept your request.

###  **If your request for part-time working is refused**

If your employer refuses your request for part-time work, they must give you a
reason for the refusal (for example, that the change would lead to staffing
difficulties).

If you are unhappy with your employer’s response and you believe they have
breached your employment rights, you can make a complaint to the WRC – read
‘Making a complaint’ below.

##  Penalising part-time employees

Your employer cannot [ penalise (or punish)
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/employment/enforcement-and-
redress/victimisation-at-work/) you when you:

  * Exercise your right to be treated as favourably as comparable full-time co-workers 
  * Refuse your employer’s request to change from full-time to part-time work (or the opposite) 
  * Object to actions that breach the Protection of Employees (Part-Time Work) Act 
  * Gave evidence in any proceedings under the Protection of Employees (Part-Time Work) Act or gave notice of your intention to do so 

Your employer is considered to have punished you if they:

  * Dismiss you 
  * Make an unfavourable change to your work conditions 
  * Treat you unfairly, including selection for redundancy 
  * Take any other action that is prejudicial to your employment 

###  **Exceptions**

There are situations where employers are not considered penalising part-time
employees. For example, your employer asks you to change from full-time to
part-time work (or the opposite).

However, the following conditions apply:

  * Your employer must have substantial grounds to justify the request and to take any action after your refusal 
  * Any action taken by your employer must follow the terms in your [ contract of employment ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/employment/employment-rights-and-conditions/contracts-of-employment/contract-of-employment/) and employment rights legislation 

##  Making a complaint

If you have a complaint, you should speak to your employer directly. If you
cannot resolve your complaint informally, you can bring your complaint to the
Workplace Relations Commission (WRC) using the [ online complaint form
](https://www.workplacerelations.ie/en/e-complaint_form/) .

You must make the complaint **within 6 months** of the dispute taking place.
The time limit may be extended for a further 6 months, if there is a
_reasonable cause_ which prevented you from bringing the complaint within the
normal time limit.

##  The laws on part-time work

The law on part-time work is set out in the [ Protection of Employees (Part-
Time Work) Act 2001
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2001/en/act/pub/0045/index.html) . This Act
applies to all part-time workers, including casual workers.

Part-time employees’ entitlements are generally in proportion ( _pro-rata
basis_ ) to full-time employees’ entitlements. This means that they should be
in proportion to your hours.

However, minimum periods of continuous service are required for the purpose
of:

  * [ Unfair dismissal ](/en/employment/unemployment-and-redundancy/dismissal/unfair-dismissal/) , under the Unfair Dismissals Acts 1973-2015, and 
  * [ Redundancy entitlements ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/employment/unemployment_and_redundancy/redundancy/redundancy.html#l1f4da) , under the Redundancy Payments Act 2003
