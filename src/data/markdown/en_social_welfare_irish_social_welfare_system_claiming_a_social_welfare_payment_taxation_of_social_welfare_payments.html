##  Is my social welfare payment taxed?

Some social welfare payments are deemed taxable, and others are not – see
tables below.

Even if your social welfare payment is taxable, you may not actually have to
pay tax on it. This is because when you get a social welfare payment, you also
get an [ Employee Tax Credit ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/money-
and-tax/tax/income-tax-credits-and-reliefs/employment-tax-credits-and-
reliefs/) (previously called a PAYE tax credit), in addition to your normal
tax credits. Tax credits reduce the amount of tax you pay. So, if a social
welfare payment is your only source of income, you may not have to pay tax
because the amount you owe in tax is less than your tax credits.

The Employee Tax Credit is given to the person claiming the social welfare
payment and not to the [ adult dependant
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-
system/claiming-a-social-welfare-payment/claiming-an-increase-in-your-social-
welfare-payment-for-an-adult-dependant/) , even if the Increase for a
Qualified Adult is paid directly to the dependant ( [ different rules applied
before 2014 ](https://www.revenue.ie/en/tax-professionals/tdm/income-tax-
capital-gains-tax-corporation-tax/part-05/05-05-33.pdf) ).

In general, you don’t pay [ Universal Social Charge
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/money-and-tax/tax/income-
tax/universal-social-charge/) (USC) and social insurance [ (PRSI)
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-
system/social-insurance-prsi/social-insurance/) on social welfare payments.
However, PRSI is payable on income from some employment schemes, such as
Community Employment.

##  How do I pay tax on my social welfare payment?

If you have a social welfare payment and another source of income, you may
have to pay tax. In this case, your taxable social welfare payment and your
other income are added together, and you are taxed on the total amount.

The Department of Social Protection does not take any tax from your social
welfare payment before it is paid to you.

Social welfare payments are taxed by reducing your tax credits and rate band.
Your non-social welfare income determines how tax due is paid.

###  **Example: If you are working or getting an occupational pension, and
getting a social welfare pension**

You are getting a social welfare pension and an occupational pension. Your
occupational pension is taxed through the Pay-As-You-Earn ( [ PAYE
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/employment/starting-work-and-changing-
job/starting-work/tax-and-starting-work/) ) system in the same way as a wage
or salary. This means that you get your tax credits in the normal way.

To tax your social welfare pension, your annual tax credits are reduced by the
tax liability on your social welfare pension. You pay tax on both pensions,
but it is collected from the occupational pension. For higher incomes, the
standard rate cut-off point will also be reduced. The technical term for this
is ' [ coding in ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/money-and-
tax/tax/income-tax/tax-return-non-paye-income/#f7a235) _'_ of credits.

The same arrangement applies if you have income from a job and a social
welfare payment. If your social welfare payment was not 'coded in', you would
have to pay tax as a self-employed person and in a lump sum by 31 October each
year.

See [ examples of how social welfare payments are taxed ](/en/social-
welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/claiming-a-social-welfare-
payment/examples-of-how-social-welfare-payments-are-taxed/) .

###  **Example: If you are self-employed and getting a social welfare
pension**

If your other source of income is not taxed through the PAYE system, (for
example, if you are self-employed, have an [ occupational pension
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/money-and-tax/personal-
finance/pensions/occupational-pensions/) from abroad, or have investment
income), then you are classed as a self-employed person and your tax is
payable annually by 31 October each year.

###  **Social security pensions from abroad**

If you have a social security pension from abroad, it is also generally
taxable in Ireland. The tax is payable annually, unless you have a source of
income that is subject to PAYE.

Certain foreign pensions that would be exempt from tax if you were resident in
the country paying the pension, are also exempt from tax in Ireland.

##  What social welfare payments are taxed?

###  **Jobseeker’s Benefit**

You do not pay tax on the first €13 per week of [ Jobseeker's Benefit
](/en/social-welfare/unemployed-people/jobseekers-benefit/) and [ Jobseeker's
Benefit (Self-Employed) ](/en/social-welfare/unemployed-people/jobseekers-
benefit-self-employed/) . If you are a systematic short-time worker, you do
not pay tax on Jobseeker's Benefit.

###  **Increase for a qualified child**

You do not pay tax on the [ Increases for Qualified Children ](/en/social-
welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/claiming-a-social-welfare-
payment/claiming-and-increase-in-your-payment-for-a-child-dependant/) on the
following payments:

  * Jobseeker's Benefit 
  * Jobseeker's Benefit (Self-Employed) 
  * Illness Benefit 
  * Partial Capacity Benefit 
  * Occupational Injuries Scheme (Injury Benefit, Disablement Pension and Incapacity Supplement) 

Other than the cases above, if your social welfare payment is taxable, you
must pay tax on any increase for your adult dependant and child dependants.
