##  What is annual leave?

Annual leave (also called _holidays from work_ ) is paid time off work. All
employees are entitled to annual leave, including full-time, part-time,
temporary and casual workers.

Most employees are entitled to 4 weeks’ annual leave each year. This is set
out in the [ Organisation of Working Time Act, 1997
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1997/act/20/section/19/enacted/en/html)
and is known as your _statutory entitlement_ . Your employer might give you
more annual leave. You can check your entitlement to annual leave in your [
contract of employment ](/en/employment/employment-rights-and-
conditions/contracts-of-employment/contract-of-employment/) .

###  Annual leave and other types of leave

Annual leave is not affected by other types of _statutory leave_ (that means
leave provided for by law). Time spent on [ maternity leave
](/en/employment/employment-rights-and-conditions/leave-and-
holidays/maternity-leave/) , [ paternity leave ](/en/employment/employment-
rights-and-conditions/leave-and-holidays/paternity-leave/) , [ adoptive leave
](/en/employment/employment-rights-and-conditions/leave-and-holidays/adoptive-
leave/) , [ parental leave ](/en/employment/employment-rights-and-
conditions/leave-and-holidays/parental-leave/) , force majeure leave and the
first 13 weeks of [ carer's leave ](/en/employment/employment-rights-and-
conditions/leave-and-holidays/carers-leave/) is treated as though you have
been in employment. For example, time spent on parental leave can be used to
_accrue_ (build up) your annual leave entitlement - see ‘Calculating your
annual leave' below.

##  How much annual leave and holiday pay am I entitled to?

Your annual leave entitlement depends on how much time you have worked in a
_leave year_ .

The statutory leave year runs from 1 April to 31 March. Many employers use the
calendar year (January to December) instead of the statutory leave year for
administrative reasons but this does not affect your statutory leave
entitlements.

###  Calculating your annual leave

There are **3 ways** to calculate your annual leave entitlement. You can use
whichever method gives you the _greater_ (biggest) entitlement:

**Method 1**

If you have worked at least 1,365 hours in a _leave year_ (see above), you are
entitled to the maximum of 4 working weeks' paid annual leave.

You cannot use this method if you changed employment during the leave year.

**Method 2**

Calculate 1/3 of a working week for each calendar month in which you worked at
least 117 hours.

**Method 3**

Calculate 8% of the hours you worked in the leave year, subject to a maximum
of 4 working weeks.

When calculating your holiday entitlement, your employer should include all
the hours you worked, **including** time spent on annual leave, maternity
leave, parental leave, force majeure leave, adoptive leave or the first 13
weeks of carer’s leave.

If you have worked for at least 8 months, you are entitled to an _unbroken
period_ of 2 weeks' annual leave. This means you can get 2 weeks off in a row.

###  Holiday pay

_Holiday pay_ (pay for annual leave) must be paid in advance at your **normal
weekly rate** .

If your pay changes from week-to-week (for example, because of commission or
bonus payments), your holiday pay is the average of your pay over the 13 weeks
before you take holidays.

###  Part-time employees

Generally, annual leave for part-time workers is calculated using **Method 3**
above. This means you can get 8% of your hours worked.

If you work full time for some months and part-time for the rest of the year,
you should calculate the leave for the full-time and the part-time periods of
work separately.

###  Agency employees

If you are an agency worker, the party who pays your wages (employment agency
or client company) is the employer for the purposes of the [ Organisation of
Working Time Act 1997
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1997/act/20/enacted/en/html) , and is
responsible for providing your annual leave entitlement.

##  Can my employer force me to take annual leave?

Usually, employees can ask to take annual leave at specific times. Your
employer can accept your request, or refuse your request.

Your employer decides when annual leave may be taken, but this is subject to a
number of conditions. Your employer must:

  * Take into account your family responsibilities, as well as the available opportunities for rest and recreation. 
  * Discuss your annual leave with you (or your union) at least one month before you are to take the leave. 

###  Can I ‘carry over’ annual leave to next year?

Annual leave should be taken within the leave year (see above). Depending on
your employer, you can agree to take your annual leave **within 6 months** of
the relevant leave year.

Any further carrying-over (also called _holding over_ ) of annual leave would
need to be agreed between you and your employer.

##  Annual leave and sick leave

###  What if I get sick while on annual leave?

If you are sick while you are on annual leave, you should get a medical
certificate from your GP (doctor) as soon as possible to cover the days you
were sick. Give the medical certificate to your employer as soon as you return
to work.

This way, the _sick days_ will not count as annual leave, and you can take
your annual leave at a later date. Your employer cannot make you to take
annual leave for time you were on certified sick leave.

###  What happens to my annual leave when I am off sick?

Your _statutory entitlement_ (legal entitlement) to annual leave continues to
build up when you are on sick leave, as long as you have a medical
certificate.

###  Carrying over your holidays

If you are on long-term sick leave and cannot take your annual leave due to
illness, you can carry it over for up to 15 months after the end of the year
it was earned.

If you leave your job within these 15 months, you should get payment instead
of the leave you did not take due to illness.

These protections are set out in an [ amendment
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2015/act/16/section/86/enacted/en/html)
to the Workplace Relations Act 2015.

##  Annual leave and other leave

In general, you are treated as being in employment while you are on:

  * Maternity leave or additional maternity leave 
  * Adoptive leave or additional adoptive leave 
  * Paternity leave 
  * Parental leave 
  * Parent’s leave 
  * Health and safety leave 

This means you can continue to build up your entitlement to annual leave.

You are entitled to annual leave for the first 13 weeks of carer’s leave.

##  Leaving your job, layoff, and short-time working

In general, your annual leave is calculated on the basis of hours worked. This
is set out in the [ Organisation of Working Time Act, 1997
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1997/act/20/section/19/enacted/en/html) .

###  Leaving your job

If you are [ leaving a job ](/en/employment/starting-work-and-changing-
job/changing-job/giving-notice/) without taking all the annual leave you are
entitled to, your employer must pay you for the days you have not taken.

###  Lay off or short-time working

During [ lay off or short-time working ](/en/employment/unemployment-and-
redundancy/redundancy/lay-off-short-time-working-and-redundancy/) , you are
still an employee of the company and your contract of employment remains
valid.

You do not build up annual leave during lay off, but you are entitled to take
annual leave that you built up before being laid off.

##  Making a complaint

If you think your holiday entitlement is wrong, try speaking informally to
your employer.

If you cannot resolve the problem informally, you can complain to the
Workplace Relations Commission.

You should apply using the WRC’s [ online complaint form
](https://www.workplacerelations.ie/en/complaints_disputes/refer_a_dispute_make_a_complaint/)
. You must make your complaint **within 6 months** of the _dispute_
(disagreement) happening.

The time limit may be extended for a further 6 months, but only if you have a
‘reasonable cause’ which prevented you bringing your complaint within the
normal time limit.

Read more about [ how to make a complaint ](/en/employment/enforcement-and-
redress/adjudication-employment-rights-disputes-and-complaints/) , including
details of the WRC adjudication process.
