##  Introduction

After you are [ arrested ](/en/justice/arrests/arrests/) , you may be taken
into custody in a Garda Station.

When you are in custody, you must be treated with due respect for your
personal rights and dignity at all times, and the Gardaí must have regard to
any physical or mental disability you may have. There should be no unnecessary
delay in dealing with you.

The rules and procedures about how you must be treated while you are in
custody are set out in the [ Criminal Justice Act 1984 (Treatment of Persons
in Custody in Garda Síochána Stations) Regulations 1987
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1987/en/si/0119.html) and 2006.

##  Garda duties to give you information

After you have been arrested, the Garda in charge of the station must give you
information about:

  * Why you have been arrested 
  * Your right to consult a solicitor 
  * Your right to tell another person that you are in custody 

If you are under 18 years of age, the Garda must tell you that your parents
will be informed that you are in custody and asked to come to the Garda
station.

Informing others about you

Information about where you are in custody must be given with your consent to:

  * Any solicitor who enquires and 
  * Any other person if the Garda in charge of the station is satisfied that the information will not delay the investigation of a crime or make the investigation more difficult 

If you are arrested in a Garda District other than the one you live in, the
District Headquarters in the district you live in must also be notified.

##  Garda duty to keep records

The Gardaí must keep a custody record on every person in custody. The Garda in
charge of the Garda Station is responsible for the accuracy of all entries in
the custody record.

If you are transferred to another Garda Station, the Garda in charge of the
station must send the custody record with you.

##  Do I have the right to consult asolicitor?

If you are 18 years or over and you have asked for a solicitor or that another
person be notified, the Garda in charge of the station must notify the
solicitor or other person as soon as possible.

If you are under 18 years of age, the Garda in charge of the station concerned
will, as soon as possible, inform your parent or guardian that you are in
custody, why you are in custody and that you have a right to consult a
solicitor.

If you are transferred to another station, your solicitor or other nominated
person must be notified of the transfer as soon as possible.

###  If your solicitor can’t be reached

If the solicitor or other person cannot be contacted within a reasonable time
or if the solicitor or other person is unable to or unwilling to attend, you
must be given an opportunity to ask for another solicitor or another person.

If you have not had access to a solicitor, and a solicitor who has not been
requested is at the station, you must be given the opportunity to consult with
the solicitor if you wish.

###  When the solicitor arrives

You can consult with a solicitor and this meeting must take place in a place
where the Gardaí cannot hear what is being said.

##  Visits and phonecalls

You may receive a visit from a relative, friend or any other person with an
interest in your welfare. You can refuse to see someone if you want.

The Garda in charge of the station must be satisfied that the visit can be
adequately supervised and will not delay the investigation of a crime or make
the investigation more difficult.

You can send a letter or make a telephone call, free of charge if the Garda in
charge is satisfied that it will not hinder or delay the investigation of
crime. A Garda can listen to the phone call and they can end it. They can also
read any letter and refuse to send it.

Before you have a supervised visit or communicate with a person other than
your solicitor, you must be informed that anything you say during the visit or
in the communication may be given in evidence.

##  Interviews while in custody

Only 2 Gardaí may question you at any one time. However, up to 4 may be
present in the interview room. If an interview lasts longer than 4 hours, you
are entitled to have a reasonable break.

A person under 18 years of age cannot be questioned without a parent or
guardian being present unless the Garda in charge authorises it.

You have a right to consult a [ solicitor ](/en/justice/courtroom/solicitors/)
before you are [ interviewed ](/en/justice/arrests/garda-interviews/) .

Almost all interviews are audio-visually recorded and detailed notes are taken
by the Gardaí present.

##  Searches

If you are [ searched ](/en/justice/arrests/powers-of-search/) by a Garda
while you are in custody, they must tell you the reason for the search and
they must make sure that it is conducted respectfully.

You must not be searched by a person (other than a doctor) of the opposite
sex.

Where a search of your person involves removal of clothing other than headgear
or outer clothing, there must be no person of the opposite sex present unless
that person is a doctor. However, a person of the opposite sex may be present
if the Garda in charge considers it necessary because of your violent
behaviour.

Where possible, a search that involves removing your underwear should be
carried out by a doctor.

If your clothes or shoes are taken by the Gardaí, you must be given
replacements of a reasonable standard.

A record must be made of the search stating the name of the person conducting
the search, the names of those present and details of any property taken from
or handed over by you.

##  Fingerprints and other samples

Your fingerprints, photographs, saliva, hair and certain other samples can
generally be taken without your consent. Your written consent is required
before the following samples can be taken and they must be taken by a doctor
or dentist as appropriate:

  * Blood, urine or pubic hair 
  * A swab from your genital region or any body opening, other than your mouth 
  * A dental impression 

The consent must be signed and recorded in the custody record.

Any refusal to provide a [ DNA ](/en/justice/evidence/dna-evidence/) or other
sample without good reason may be later used in court against you.

##  General conditions while in custody

You must be allowed reasonable time to rest.

You must be given at least 2 light meals and one main meal in any 24-hour
period. You may have meals supplied at your own expense where it is
practicable for the Garda to arrange this.

You must have access to toilet facilities.

You will, as far as possible, be held on your own in a cell. Persons of the
opposite sex must not be placed in a cell together. A violent person must not
be placed in a cell with another person if this can be avoided.

While you are in a cell, a Garda can visit you approximately every 30 minutes.
A drunken person or a person under the influence of drugs will be visited and
spoken to and if necessary, woken up every 15 minutes for a period of 2 hours
or longer if their condition warrants it.

A Garda must always be accompanied when visiting a person of the opposite sex
who is alone in a cell.

If you are under the age of 18, you should not be kept in a cell unless there
is no other secure accommodation available and, where possible, you will not
be placed in a cell with an adult other than an adult relative.

###  Ill-treatment

No Garda can subject you to ill-treatment of any kind or the threat of ill-
treatment (whether against you, your family or any other person connected with
you) or permit any other person to do so.

No Garda can use force against you unless reasonable force is necessary:

  * In self-defence 
  * To make sure that you comply with lawful directions 
  * To prevent your escape 
  * To restrain you from injuring yourself or others, damaging property or destroying or interfering with evidence 

If you allege physical ill-treatment, the Garda in charge of the station will
arrange for you to be medically examined. However, if you have made the
allegation about a Garda, the member in charge of the station may not order
the medical examination if they consider the complaint to be frivolous or
vexatious.

###  Medical treatment

The Garda in charge must get a doctor or send you to a hospital if you are:

  * Injured 
  * Under the influence of alcohol or drugs and cannot be woken up 
  * Unable to respond normally to questions or conversation (not due to the influence of alcohol alone) 
  * Suffering from a mental illness 
  * In need of medical attention 

If you need medication for a heart condition, diabetes, epilepsy or another
potentially serious condition, the Garda in charge should get it for you if
they think it is necessary.

If you are sent to a hospital, this must be recorded. Any instructions given
by a doctor about your medical care and steps to be taken to comply with the
instructions should also be recorded.

If you ask to be examined by a doctor of your choice at your own expense, the
member in charge of the station must make the necessary arrangements.

If you are removed to hospital, an immediate relative and any other person
required to be notified shall be informed.
