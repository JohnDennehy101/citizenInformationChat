###  Together we can prevent homelessness before it starts.

Threshold is the only organisation in Ireland advocating for the prevention of
homelessness. We know that the best way to keep people from losing their homes
is to support renters. We work tirelessly resolving tenancy problems to keep
people in their homes and out of homelessness.

###  Stories

This is the story of just one of the thousands of people and families our
expert service advisors have been able to help from the brink of homelessness.

I know I’m much more than that. I know all about the years I’ve worked as a
nurse – a job I love dearly. I know about the rare medical condition that
forced me to stop work. I know how dedicated I am to raising my Aoife, how
much she means to me.
