##  Introduction

When you buy a used car from a trader (a car dealer, garage or a business
selling on an online marketplace), you have similar consumer rights as when [
buying a new car ](/en/consumer/cars/buying-a-new-car/) .

You can expect the car to meet certain conditions of quality and durability
and match what was set out in the contract. While you can’t expect a used car
to be the same standard as a new one, the quality should reflect the price you
paid. If you buy at an auction you don’t have the same rights if the car is
'sold as seen'. Check the auction's conditions of sale before you buy.

If you buy from a private seller, you also have fewer legal rights. This is
because consumer law applies to contracts between a trader and a consumer and
does not cover consumer-to-consumer deals.

](/en/consumer/cars/buying-a-used-car/) .

##  You bought from a garage or car dealer

If a used car you bought develops a fault, you have the right to ask the
garage or car dealer to fix the problem by:

  * Repairing the faulty part(s) for free, within a reasonable time and without significant inconvenience to you 
  * Providing a replacement part or a car of similar quality or value 
  * Giving you a refund of the full price paid or a partial refund with a deduction for use (also known as recission)

](/en/consumer/shopping/problems-with-faulty-goods/) and [ how to make a
complaint ](/en/consumer/how-to-complain/how-to-make-a-complaint/) .

###  Car is still under warranty

If your car was sold with a manufacturer’s warranty, this provides extra
protections. Check the terms and conditions to see if the warranty is still in
date, what problems are covered and what the seller’s obligations are.

Used car warranties are agreed between you and the dealer when you are
negotiating the sale. They are usually non-transferable. This means that you
will have to go back to the garage or car dealer you bought the car from to
get repairs done under that warranty.

A warranty or guarantee gives you extra protections but it does not replace [
your statutory rights ](/en/consumer/consumer-laws/your-consumer-rights/) when
goods are faulty. The seller still has a legal duty to provide you with a
repair, replacement or refund if the car turns out not to be of satisfactory
quality and durability or match what was set out in the contract.

Read more about [ guarantees and warranties
](/en/consumer/shopping/guarantees-and-warranties/) .

##  You bought under a finance agreement

In all Hire Purchase and Personal Contract Plan (PCP) agreements, the car
remains the property of the finance company and ownership of the car does not
pass to you until the final instalment is paid.

If a car you bought under a Hire Purchase or PCP agreement is or becomes
faulty, both the seller and the owner (finance company) are responsible. You
can claim against either party in this situation. You cannot claim against the
car manufacturer.

If the seller agrees to give a refund, this will be provided to the finance
company who will usually:

  * End the finance agreement 
  * Pay you back your deposit plus any payments you have already made 
  * Deduct a certain amount for use of the vehicle 

Find out more about [ hire purchase ](/en/money-and-tax/personal-
finance/loans-and-credit/hire-purchase/) .

##  You bought at an auction

When you buy a car at auction, it is usually ‘sold as seen’. It is up to you
to do the necessary checks by inspecting it before bidding (for example, by
getting a mechanic to examine the car before you buy).

If something goes wrong after you buy, the auction firm is not responsible.
Check the auction's conditions of sale before you buy.

##  You bought from a private seller

You have very few legal rights when you buy a car from a private seller.
Consumer laws only apply to deals between a _consumer_ (a person who buys a
good or service for personal use or consumption) and a _trader_ (a person
acting for purposes related to their trade, business or profession). It does
not apply when you buy from a private individual who is not a trader (for
example, someone who is selling their own car to you but who does not sell
cars as a profession)

You should still contact the seller to try to work out a solution. If you
can't resolve the problem, you can [ take a civil case ](/en/justice/civil-
law/taking-and-appealing-a-civil-case/) or use the [ small claims procedure
](/en/justice/courts-system/small-claims-court/) .

##  Situations not covered by law

In some cases, you do not have a right to a repair or refund when there is a
fault with your used car.

This includes where:

  * You were told about the fault when you bought the car 
  * You (or your mechanic) inspected the car and should have spotted the problem, for example, a dent 
  * You caused the fault 
  * The fault is from normal wear and tear. This means it is normal considering how much the car has been used (for example, change of tyres or brake pads) 

##  Taking your complaint further

Always complain first to the person who sold you the car.

If your complaint can't be resolved by the seller themselves, you can make a
formal complaint to the relevant trade or professional body.

Where the trader is not a member of any trade or professional body or you
bought the car from a private seller, you can consider [ taking a civil case
](/en/justice/civil-law/taking-and-appealing-a-civil-case/) or using the [
small claims procedure ](/en/justice/courts-system/small-claims-court/) .

###  Unresolved dispute with garage or car dealer

If your complaint can't be resolved and the garage or car dealer is a member
of the [ Society of the Irish Motor Industry (SIMI) ](https://www.simi.ie/en)
, you can make a formal complaint to SIMI through its [ consumer complaints
service or arbitration scheme ](https://www.simi.ie/en/consumer-
help/complaints-service) . SIMI will try to mediate between you and the trader
to resolve the issue.

SIMI deals with complaints relating to:

  * Used car you bought from SIMI members 
  * Service or repairs of cars by SIMI members 

Make your complaint to SIMI within 3 months from the date your problem
started. There is no charge for using the SIMI complaints or arbitration
services.

To check if the garage or car dealer is a member of SIMI, search the [ SIMI
directory ](https://www.simi.ie/en/find-a-member) or ring 01 6161690\. If a
dealer is a member of SIMI, they will have the current logo displayed on their
premises along with the current year of membership.

SIMI members have to follow the code of ethics and offer a high standard of
customer service. This includes doing checks on second-hand vehicles and
sorting out any issues that arise.

###  Unresolved dispute with private seller

If you cannot resolve your dispute with a private seller, you can consider
taking legal action. If the amount involved is less than €2,000, you can take
a case to the small claims court using the [ small claims procedure
](/en/justice/courts-system/small-claims-court/) . For amounts over €2,000,
ask a solicitor about [ taking a civil case ](/en/justice/civil-law/taking-
and-appealing-a-civil-case/) .
