###  Health

###  Funding

There will be a 2.1% increase in health spending in 2009. Gross expenditure
for the Health and Children Group, which includes the Department of Health and
Children, the Health Service Executive (HSE) and the Office of the Minister
for Children and Youth Affairs is €16,335 million in 2009, an increase of
€180.7 million. The underlying gross increase is €384.7 million when account
is taken of the Long-term Care Repayment Scheme.

###  Medical cards for over 70s

**New applications**

From 1 January 2009 new income thresholds will apply for medical cards for
people aged 70 and over. (The existing arrangements continue to apply until
the end of 2008.)

New income thresholds will be €700 weekly gross for a single person (36,500
per year) and €1,400 a week (€73,000 a year) for a couple. It appears at
present that there will be no deductions allowed as were outlined in previous
announcements, for example, rent or mortgage or medical expenses.

If one member of a couple is aged 70, they will both qualify for a medical
card if their income is below €1,400 a week.

Income from savings will be taken into account, but savings up to the first
€36,000 (for a single person) and €72,000 (for a couple) are not counted.

**People over age 70 who already have a medical card**

The card will not expire on 31st December 2008, as stated in previous
announcements.

The HSE will write to all people aged 70 and over informing them about the new
arrangements. **Only people who have income above the limits** will be asked
to reply to the HSE. Everyone else will simply keep their card.

People over these limits can still apply for medical cards on a hardship basis
under the discretionary scheme.

###  Fair Deal nursing home scheme

€55 million is being provided to implement the Fair Deal scheme to provide a
more equitable system of residential care for older people.

month which will lead to savings of €15 million in drug costs.

###  Early Childcare Supplement

The Early Childcare Supplement will be paid monthly instead of quarterly and
eligibility is being changed to reduce the period for which children qualify
for the payment from 0-6 years to 0-5 years and 6 months.

###  Tax relief on unreimbursed medical expenses

the full marginal rate of tax, will be reimbursed at the standard rate only

###  Other health allocations

The Cancer Control Programme is allocated €15 million.

€33 million is being allocated to meet the full year cost of service
developments commenced in 2008.

The HSE will begin a new proposal to fast track the rollout of new GP practice
units in collaboration with the private sector. The HSE will retain full
control of the units.

A range of administrative (€115 million) and other operational efficiencies
(€270 million) will be made in the HSE and agencies, to release resources for
allocation to key frontline health and personal social services in 2009. The
Cancer Control Programme is allocated €15 million and €33 million is being
allocated to meet the full year cost of service developments commenced in

###  Programme of redundancies in the HSE

##  Environment and Housing

###  Environment

The Water Services Investment Programme gets an increased provision of €89
million (+19%).

Due to a reduction of 63% in funding, the landfill remediation programme in
2009 will require local authorities to re-profile necessary works over a
longer period with the most urgent works being prioritised.

Funding for urban regeneration in 2009 has decreased by 95%. This reflects the
completion in early 2008 of the final funding allocations for urban renewal
grants under the two Regional Operation Programmes (2000-2006). The
introduction of a new programme in 2010 will be examined in 2009 subject to
the availability of resources.

Capital funding of €71 million is being made available to fund sustainable
energy and energy research programmes. This allows for the expansion of some
programmes.

Funding for the Home Energy Saving scheme run by Sustainable Energy Ireland
(SEI), and piloted since 2008, is being increased from €5 million in 2008 to
€20 million in 2009.

Funding of €5 million will also be provided for the Warmer Homes Scheme.

The funding provision for the Greener Homes Scheme run by SEI has been scaled
back from €27 million to €12 million.

Capital expenditure of €10 million is provided for additional carbon reduction
measures to target climate change initiatives in the transport sector.

The tax incentive introduced in Budget and Finance Act 2008, which provides
for capital allowances of 100% of expenditure incurred by companies in the
year the equipment is purchased, is being extended from 3 categories to 7
categories. The new categories to be included in this scheme are:

  * Data server related systems and large energy saving office equipment associated with Information & Communications Technology 
  * Efficient heating/electricity provision equipment and control systems 
  * Efficient electrical and control equipment associated with process & heating ventilation and air-conditioning systems 
  * Alternative fuel vehicles 

The salmon conservation scheme is winding down in 2009, giving a reduction of
€11.3 million on current spending, compared with 2008. There is also a
reduction of €0.4 million on the Fisheries Boards funding.

Capital funding of €45 million is being provided for communications
infrastructure. This will facilitate rollout of the National Broadband Scheme
to ensure broadband availability within the timeframe 2009 to 2011 in rural
areas not currently served by broadband.

##  Housing

###  Mortgage interest relief

From 1 January 2009, mortgage interest relief is being increased for first-

Lo Call 1890 252 842.

###  Affordable housing

Introduction of a Government Equity Initiative to assist those seeking
affordable housing. Under this Initiative the Government will assist those
seeking affordable housing by taking an equity share. It will replace the
current approach through which affordable housing is made available under Part
V, the 1999 Affordable Housing Scheme and the Affordable Housing Initiative.

Instead of selling units at a discounted price with the value of the discount
to be subject to a reducing claw-back, the Government would take an equity
stake in affordable units sold, which the purchaser can either buy out in
steps or at the end of a fixed period.

###  Energy saving grants and schemes

Funding for the Home Energy Saving scheme run by Sustainable Energy Ireland
(SEI) is being increased from €5 million in 2008 to €20 million in 2009.

Funding of €5 million will also be provided for the Warmer Homes Scheme.

The funding provision for the Greener Homes Scheme run by SEI has been scaled

pupils per class. In the case of post-primary schools, the allocation basis
will be altered by one point with effect from September 2009 from the current
18 to 1 basis to a revised basis of 19 to 1. In the case of fee-charging post-
primary schools, there will be an additional one-point adjustment.

The ceiling of 2 on the number of language support teachers per school is
being re-imposed, with some alleviation for the position of those schools
where there is a significant concentration of newcomer pupils as a proportion
of the overall pupil enrolment.

###  Abolition of school-related grants

A number of grants, mainly school related, are being abolished or scaled back
realising savings of €26.6million per annum.

###  Adult and further education

There is a reduction in the provision of 500 places on the Back to Education
Initiative – reducing the total number of places to 9,000. The number of

particular, resources will be deployed within the FÁS allocation to assist
those who have recently become unemployed. Within FÁS’s budget:
