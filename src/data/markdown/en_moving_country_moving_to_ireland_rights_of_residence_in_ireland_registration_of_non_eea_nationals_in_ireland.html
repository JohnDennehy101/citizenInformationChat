##  Introduction

If you are not a citizen of the [ European Economic Area (EEA)
](https://www.irishimmigration.ie/eu-eea-country-or-switzerland/) , the [
United Kingdom ](/en/government-in-ireland/ireland-and-the-uk/residence-rules-
UK-citizens/) or Switzerland, you need [ permission to enter ](/en/moving-
country/visas-for-ireland/permission-to-land-in-ireland/) Ireland. If you want
to stay for more than 3 months you must have [ permission to remain
](/en/moving-country/moving-to-ireland/rights-of-residence-in-
ireland/residence-rights-of-non-eea-nationals-in-ireland/) and register your
presence in Ireland with Immigration Service Delivery (ISD). This is how you
get an Irish Residence Permit (IRP).

##  Who has to register with immigration?

You must register if you plan to stay in Ireland for over 3 months and you:

  * Are 16 or over 
  * Are a citizen of a country outside the EEA (this is the EU and Norway, Iceland and Lichtenstein), Switzerland and the UK 
  * Have received permission to remain in Ireland 

If you are living in Ireland already and are about to turn 16, you must
register with ISD.

###  People who have recently arrived from Ukraine

The Department of Justice has started to issue [ Irish Resident Permit (IRP)
cards to beneficiaries of the EU Temporary Protection Directive
](https://www.irishimmigration.ie/introduction-of-irish-resident-permit-irp-
cards-for-beneficiaries-of-temporary-protection/) .

You can read about [ coming to Ireland from Ukraine. ](/en/moving-
country/asylum-seekers-and-refugees/the-asylum-process-in-ireland/coming-to-
ireland-from-ukraine/)

###  Permission to remain

You may have already applied to ISD for permission to remain in the State and
received a letter granting your permission. This could be because you have:

  * Refugee or subsidiary protection status following an [ application for international protection ](/en/moving-country/asylum-seekers-and-refugees/the-asylum-process-in-ireland/applying-for-refugee-status-in-ireland/)
  * Leave to remain following an application for international protection 
  * Permission to remain in Ireland as the family member of an EEA national 
  * Permission to remain in Ireland as the family member of an Irish citizen 
  * Permission to remain as the parent of an Irish citizen child 
  * Any other permission to remain that was made by application while you were in Ireland 

You should bring the letter you got from ISD with you when you go to register.

###  ‘D’ or long stay visa holders

If you have recently come to Ireland on a ‘D’ (long stay) visa, or you are a
citizen of a country that does not require an entry visa (non-visa required),
you can register with ISD without making a written application in advance.
This could be because you are:

  * Joining a family member who has international protection in Ireland (family reunification) 
  * Joining or moving to Ireland with your Irish spouse or family member 
  * Joining or moving to Ireland with your dependant Irish family member 
  * An international student 
  * On a working holiday visa 
  * Moving to Ireland with an employment permit 

##  How to apply for an Irish Residence Permit

As soon as possible following your arrival in Ireland, you should call or
email your [ immigration registration office
](https://www.irishimmigration.ie/registering-your-immigration-permission/how-
to-register-your-immigration-permission-for-the-first-time/) for an
appointment to register.

If you live in Dublin, Cork, Kildare, Limerick, Meath or Wicklow you must
phone 1800 800630 to book an appointment to register at the Burgh Quay
Registration Office. This Freephone number is open from 9am to 5pm, Monday to
Friday. To make an appointment you will need your passport and a valid email
address. ISD will email you the date, time and location of your appointment,
and a unique appointment confirmation number which you will need when you
attend your appointment.

###  What must I bring?

The documents you need will depend on the immigration permission you are
applying for. You can find out the documents you will need to [ register with
immigration in Ireland ](https://www.irishimmigration.ie/registering-your-
immigration-permission/how-to-register-your-immigration-permission-for-the-
first-time/required-documents/) on the ISD website.

###  How much does it cost?

You must pay a fee of €300 for your Irish Residence Permit (IRP). Your IRP is
free if you:

  * Have refugee status 
  * Have subsidiary protection status 
  * Have leave to remain under Section 49 of the International Protection Act 2015 
  * Are under 18 
  * Are resident based on your marriage to an Irish citizen 
  * Are a family member of an EU citizen 

##  How to renew your Irish Residence Permit

Before your Irish Residence Permit (IRP) expires you should go to [ your
immigration registration office ](https://www.irishimmigration.ie/registering-
your-immigration-permission/how-to-renew-your-current-permission/) to renew
it. You will need to bring your passport, your current card and evidence to
support your residence permission, such as an employment permit.

###  Online renewals

If you live in Dublin, Cork, Kildare, Limerick, Meath or Wicklow, you can [
renew your IRP online ](https://www.irishimmigration.ie/registering-your-
immigration-permission/how-to-renew-your-current-permission/registration-
renewal-dublin-kildare-meath-or-wicklow/) . This means you will not have to go
to the registration office in Burgh Quay to register in person. You must have
less than 12 weeks left on your current permission before you can use the
online renewal system.

To renew your IRP online, you should:

  * Complete the [ online registration form ](https://inisonline.jahs.ie/user/login)
  * Scan and upload your documents 
  * Pay the fee 
  * Get a reference number (by email) 

You must scan and upload the following documents when you are applying:

  * Biometric page of your current passport (the photo page) 
  * Front and back of your current IRP 

You should also upload documents that show that you are satisfying your
immigration conditions. This depends on your situation, and may include:

  * Evidence that you are supporting your Irish citizen child 
  * Proof that you have paid your college fees, have met the attendance requirements and are enrolled in a college course 
  * Proof that you are living with your spouse or partner (if applying based on your relationship with them) 
  * Your employment permit 

You can read a [ full list of documents
](https://www.irishimmigration.ie/required-documents/) on the ISD website.

###  What happens after I register?

Following registration with immigration officials, you will be issued with an
Irish Residence Permit (IRP) by post.

You must carry your card with you at all times and show it to an immigration
officer or the Garda Síochána if requested.

If you change your address, or change your name, you should email [
immigrationsupport@justice.ie ](mailto:immigrationsupport@justice.ie) .

###  New passports

To renew your IRP because you have a new passport, you can use the [ ISD
online system ](https://inisonline.jahs.ie/user/login) if you live in Dublin,
Cork, Kildare, Limerick, Meath or Wicklow .

##  Travelling abroad

Non-EEA nationals who wish to travel abroad must have a valid IRP card to re-
enter Ireland. A soft copy of your IRP card is not acceptable for travel.

If you want to travel abroad, you should contact the country that you are
travelling to and find out about their requirements, such as the required
immigration permission and documentation.

##  Immigration stamps

As well as your Irish Residence Permit (IRP), you will also receive a [ stamp
in your passport ](http://www.inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/Pages/registration-stamps) ,
which specifies the duration and the conditions of your permission to remain
in Ireland. If you are renewing online, you will not receive a stamp in your
passport.

The following table lists the different types of stamp issued to non-EEA
nationals:
