##  Introduction

A commission of investigation is a [ type of inquiry ](/en/government-in-
ireland/how-government-works/tribunals-and-investigations/tribunals-
introduction/) into a matter of public concern. They are less expensive and
quicker than a [ tribunal of inquiry ](/en/government-in-ireland/how-
government-works/tribunals-and-investigations/tribunals-of-inquiry/) . In
certain circumstances, a tribunal of inquiry may be set up after a commission
of investigation has reported.

Commissions of investigation can be established under the [ Commissions of
Investigation Act 2004
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2004/en/act/pub/0023/index.html) .

A commission is set up by government order – this must be approved by the Dáil
and Seanad. The terms of reference are set by the Government or by an
individual Minister. These terms must be accompanied by statements setting out
the expected time and cost of an investigation.

##  Powers of commissions

Commissions seek the voluntary co-operation of witnesses but have powers to
compel people to give evidence if necessary. They also have powers to search
premises and take documents.

In general, evidence is given in private. Commissions are less like a court of
law than tribunals. The legal representatives of other parties will be present
only if the commission is satisfied that their presence is necessary in the
interests of the investigation and fair procedures. Witnesses may only be
cross-examined if the commission agrees.

The Act provides for guidelines to be prepared by the relevant Minister for
witnesses’ legal costs. A person who obstructs the commission or does not co-
operate could be liable for any additional costs resulting from this.

##  Reports of commissions ofinvestigation

A commission makes a final report on its findings to a specified Minister. The
Minister may request interim reports on the general progress of a commission's
investigation or on a particular aspect of the investigation.

The Minister must publish the commission’s final report unless the Minister
considers that the publication might prejudice any criminal proceedings that
are in progress. In such a case, the Minister may apply to the High Court for
directions.

There are provisions for people named in the report to challenge the findings
in relation to them.

You can read the full reports of the commissions in the table above.
