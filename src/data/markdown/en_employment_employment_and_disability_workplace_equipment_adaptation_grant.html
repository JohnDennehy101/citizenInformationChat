  * [ In-Work Support ](/en/employment/employment-and-disability/work-and-access-in-work-support-grant/)
  * [ Personal Reader ](/en/employment/employment-and-disability/personal-reader-grant/)
  * [ Work Equipment ](/en/employment/employment-and-disability/work-and-access-workplace-equipment-grant/)
  * Workplace Adaptation 
  * [ Disability Equality and Inclusion Training ](/en/employment/employment-and-disability/disability-equality-and-inclusion-training-grant/)

necessary changes to their workplace for an employee or future employee with a

employees home should be covered under the [ Housing Adaptation Grant
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/housing/housing-grants-and-
schemes/housing-supports-for-older-people-and-people-with-
disabilities/housing-adaptation-grant-for-people-with-disability/) , even if
it is the employee’s primary workplace).

##  Who can apply?

the workplace.

  * Buy equipment or adaptations required by law, such as building. regulations on accessing premises, sanitary facilities and parking. 
  * Cover the usual costs of setting up or running a business. 
  * Fund adaptations to their home even, if it is the employee’s primary workplace – these should be covered under the [ Housing Adaptation Grant ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/housing/housing-grants-and-schemes/housing-supports-for-older-people-and-people-with-disabilities/housing-adaptation-grant-for-people-with-disability/) . 

##  How much is the grant?

##  How to apply

The Department of Social Protection is developing an online application
process, which will be available soon.

To apply, there must be a Workplace Needs Assessment to demonstrate the need
for workplace adaptations and determine the specific adaptations needed. The
employee should support the application.

###  **Step 1: Complete the application form**

  * Request the form from your local Intreo Office or download it from gov.ie. 
  * Complete the [ WA2 Form ](https://www.gov.ie/pdf/?file=https://assets.gov.ie/297282/e5bcc9e3-27ba-4139-88c2-3f498e4079a2.pdf#page=null) . 

###  **Step 2: Submission and support details**

  * Send your completed WA2 Form by post to Work and Access Section, Central Team, Finglas Intreo Centre, PO Box 13736, Freepost FDN7696, Dublin 11 

###  **Step 3: Assessment and processing**

  * A designated Employer Relations Officer (ERO) will manage your application. 
  * You will be contacted directly to discuss available options and necessary documents. 
  * Final approval is required before purchasing any support. 
  * Applications submitted after purchasing supports cannot be processed or paid. 

###  **Quotes**

Your application must include invoices or quotes for any adaptations to ensure
the best, most cost-effective option has been chosen.

####  **How many quotations are needed?**

Number of quotations needed:

  * Under €700: 1 quotation 
  * €700 to €1,500: 2 quotations 
  * Over €1,500: 3 quotations 

If getting multiple quotes is not possible, a justification must be given (for
example, a shortage of qualified specialists).

Only the most cost-effective recommendation needs to be stated.

##  Sourcing and ownership of the adaptations

###  **Sourcing the adaptations**

Employers are responsible for sourcing the necessary adaptations themselves.
Once the application is fully approved, the employer can procure and purchase
the approved adaptation and then request reimbursement from the Department of
Social Protection.

There is no pre-approved list of providers.

###  **Ownership of adaptations**

Once the adaptations are integrated into the workplace, the employer keeps
ownership and is responsible for the insurance, repair, and maintenance of the
adaptations.
