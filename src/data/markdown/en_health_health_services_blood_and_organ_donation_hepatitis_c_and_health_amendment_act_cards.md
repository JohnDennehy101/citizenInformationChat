##  How to apply for a HAA card

You can apply for a Health Amendment Act (HAA) Card if you got Hepatitis C in
Ireland directly or indirectly by:

  * The administration of Human Immunoglobulin-Anti-D or 
  * Another blood product or a blood transfusion 

To apply for a HAA Card contact your [ Hepatitis C Liaison Officer
](https://www.hse.ie/eng/about/who/primarycare/guidetohepcservices.html) in [
your Local Health Office ](http://www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/1/LHO) or the
National Hepatitis C Office.

You will have a HAA card for life, including access to all of the health
services listed above.

##  Hepatitis C Insurance Scheme

If you were infected with Hepatitis C and/or HIV from Human Immunoglobulin-
Anti-D or another blood product or blood transfusion in Ireland, you can
access the Hepatitis C Insurance Scheme. This provides access to life
assurance, mortgage protection and travel insurance.

If you are part of this scheme, you only pay the average basic premium that an
uninfected person of the same age and gender would pay. The scheme pays the
additional premiums levied or covers the additional risks that would otherwise
prevent a policy being taken out

###  How to apply for the Hepatitis C Insurance Scheme

You need an Eligibility Certificate to get the Insurance Scheme.

To get an Eligibility Certificate contact the HSE Insurance Scheme
Administrator (details below), who will send you an application pack.
Eligibility is based on certain criteria.

Compensation Tribunal you are automatically entitled to take out insurance
under the scheme.
