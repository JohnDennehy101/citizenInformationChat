##  Introduction

If a married couple or civil partners can agree the terms on which they will
live separately, they may enter into a _separation agreement_ . The essence of
a separation agreement is that it is an agreement. Both parties must consent
to the terms of the agreement.

The agreement is a legally binding contract setting out each party's rights
and obligations to the other. The terms of the agreement are usually reached
either through mediation or negotiation through solicitors. If agreement can
be reached reasonably quickly between the parties and a separation agreement
drawn up, it is cheaper and less stressful than taking a court case. Many
couples formalise their separation in this way.

##  Mediation

Mediation is not marriage counselling. Its purpose is not to help a couple to
reconcile. Its purpose is to aid couples who have decided to separate to
resolve any disputes they may have in relation to the key issues such as
custody and access to children, maintenance and property rights. The mediator
is neutral and encourages the separating couple to co-operate with each other
in working out mutually acceptable arrangements that they will stick to. Any
separating couple can avail of mediation, whether they are married or not.
This includes same-sex couples.

Mediation normally takes up to six or seven sessions but this can vary
depending on complexity. If agreement is reached, the mediator will draw up
the terms of the agreement. It is recommended that people seek independent
legal advice before signing the agreement.

Mediation is confidential and any communication with a mediator is not
admissible if agreement is not reached and there are subsequent court
proceedings.

It is advisable for couples who opt for mediation to ensure that they obtain
legal and financial advice before attending mediation so that they know their
rights and can make informed decisions.

##  Negotiation through solicitors

Where the agreement is negotiated through solicitors, each party must have
their own solicitor to ensure that they receive independent legal advice.

##  Collaborative practice

Collaborative practice is a way of resolving family law matters, including
separation and divorce. Both you and your spouse/partner work with
collaborative lawyers. Everyone signs an agreement disqualifying your
collaborative lawyers from representing you in court if the process breaks
down. Neither lawyer can act for you in any contested court proceedings.

Through face-to-face meetings, you and your spouse/civil partner discuss and
resolve issues such as custody and access to children, maintenance and
property rights. The process is dependent on both parties making full and
frank disclosure of all of their assets so that negotiations can be open and
honest.

If the process is successful you will have an agreement with your spouse/civil
partner which you will both have had responsibility for.

Not every lawyer is trained in collaborative law and it is likely to be more
difficult to engage in the process if one of the lawyers is not so trained.  

##  Deed of Separation

The actual document drawn up and signed by both parties, when they reach
agreement, is often called a _Deed of Separation_ and is a legally binding
written contract. The main issues dealt with in a separation agreement are as
follows:

  * An agreement to live apart 
  * Agreed arrangements in relation to [ custody and access to children ](/en/birth-family-relationships/separation-and-divorce/separation-and-divorce-children/)
  * The occupation and ownership of the [ family/shared home ](/en/birth-family-relationships/separation-and-divorce/family-and-shared-home/) and any other property 
  * [ Maintenance and any lump sum payments ](/en/birth-family-relationships/separation-and-divorce/maintenance-orders-and-agreements/)
  * Indemnity from the debts of the other spouse/civil partner 
  * Taxation 
  * [ Succession rights ](/en/birth-family-relationships/separation-and-divorce/succession/) . 

It can be made into a rule of court by application to the court. This ensures
that all the terms agreed upon can be legally enforced where covered by
appropriate legislation. Information on [ making a separation agreement a rule
of court ](https://www.courts.ie/judicial-separation) is available on the
Courts Service website.

**Reversing a separation**

If you and your former partner decide to get back together, you can apply to
the court to have your deed of separation cancelled. You will have to satisfy
the court that you have reconciled as a couple and that you intend to resume
cohabiting as a married couple.

##  Rates

The [ Family Mediation Service ](/en/birth-family-relationships/separation-
and-divorce/family-mediation-separating-couples/) is part of the Legal Aid
Board and is free of charge. Alternatively you may choose to pay a private
mediator. Private mediators charge in a variety of ways (daily rate/hourly
rate/flat rate). The [ Mediators' Institute of Ireland
](https://www.themii.ie/) can provide you with a list of private accredited
mediators.

If you are eligible for legal aid and advice from the Legal Aid Board, you
must pay a contribution towards costs. The Legal Aid Board can provide you
with a lawyer trained in collaborative practice. Private collaborative
practitioners charge an hourly rate which you can agree in advance.

If you choose to use a private solicitor, you should be aware that there is no
fixed rate of charges for legal fees. You are advised to obtain some quotes
before deciding on a legal firm.
