#  Legal Aid Board

  * Introduction 
  * Cases covered by the Legal Aid Board 
  * Further information 

##  Introduction

The Legal Aid Board is a statutory body established under the [ Civil Legal
Aid Act 1995 ](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1995/en/act/pub/0032/index.html)
. The main functions of the Board are to:

  * Provide legal aid and legal advice in civil cases (non-criminal cases) to people who meet the criteria 
  * Provide a family mediation service 
  * Provide information about its services 
  * Manage and administer three criminal legal aid schemes (but it does not provide direct legal aid or advice in respect of criminal matters) 
  * Assist in the operation of the Abhaile scheme (which helps people in home mortgage arrears) 

This Board consists of a chairperson and twelve other members. At least 5 of
the members of the Board must be women and 5 must be men. Two members of the
Board must be barristers, 2 must be solicitors and 2 must be members of the
staff of the Board.

The Board has a [ network of full-time and part-time law centres
](http://www.legalaidboard.ie/lab/publishing.nsf/Content/Law_Centres)
throughout Ireland. The Board has also established panels of solicitors and
barristers in private practice who provide legal aid and advice under the Act.
If a barrister is required to deal with your case, the Legal Aid Board will
appoint one to represent you.

The Board's [ Family Mediation Service ](/en/birth-family-
relationships/separation-and-divorce/family-mediation-separating-couples/)
helps couples who have decided to separate or divorce, or who have already
separated, to negotiate an agreed way forward, while addressing the needs and
interests of all involved.

##  Cases covered by the Legal Aid Board

###  Civil matters

The Legal Aid Board tends to provide legal aid and legal advice in the
following areas mainly:

  * Maintenance 
  * Domestic violence 
  * Custody of and access to children 
  * Problems relating to hire-purchase agreements 
  * Contract disputes 
  * Applications for asylum, subsidiary protection or permission to remain in Ireland

](https://www.legalaidboard.ie/en/our-services/legal-aid-services/common-
legal-problems/rape-and-sexual-assault/) in certain criminal cases of sexual
offences, including rape, aggravated sexual assault and incest. A complainant
is the person making the complaint.
