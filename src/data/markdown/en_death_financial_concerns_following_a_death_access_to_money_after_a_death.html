##  Introduction

When a person dies, their property passes to their personal representative.
This is usually a close family member. The personal representative then
distributes the deceased’s person’s assets (money, possessions and property)
in accordance with the law, the will - if there is one - or the [ laws of
intestacy ](/en/death/the-deceaseds-estate/what-happens-the-deceaseds-
estate#lc8139) if there is no will. These assets are described as [ the
deceased person’s estate ](/en/death/the-deceaseds-estate/dealing-with-the-
deceaseds-estate/) .

You may need access to some of the deceased person's money to pay for funeral
expenses. Many banks have arrangements in place to help pay for funeral
expenses from the deceased person’s account (you should contact the bank to
find out more).

You may also need to get access for living expenses, at least until a social
welfare payment is awarded. There is a [ range of payments provided by the
Department of Social Protection (DSP) ](/en/social-welfare/death-related-
benefits/benefits-and-entitlements-following-a-death/) that are available to
help families during this difficult time.

##  Money in bank accounts

If money is held in the deceased person’s name only, then family members
usually cannot get access until probate is granted to the personal
representative. But if the amount in an account is small, the bank may release
it to the personal representative or the next of kin.

###  Bank accounts in joint names

If the bank account is in the joint names of your loved one and their spouse
or civil partner, the money can usually be transferred into the surviving
spouse or civil partner’s name. You will need the death certificate to do
this.

If the bank account is in the joint names of the deceased person and someone
else, and the bank was given instructions when the account was opened that the
other person was to receive the money on the death of the deceased, the money
can be transferred into the survivor’s name.

If there is an account with more than €50,000, you will also need a letter of
clearance from Revenue allowing the money to be transferred to the surviving
account holder, pending investigations about [ Capital Acquisitions Tax
](/en/money-and-tax/tax/capital-taxes/capital-acquisitions-tax/) (CAT). CAT is
a form of inheritance tax. Spouses and civil partners are not liable for CAT
on inheritances from each other.

If you think the deceased person may have had a [ dormant bank account
](/en/money-and-tax/personal-finance/banking/dormant-bank-accounts-in-
ireland/) , you should contact the financial institution at which the account
was held. If that financial institution no longer exists and you want to find
out where to make your enquiry or claim, you should contact the Banking and
Payments Federation Ireland (BPFI).

##  Post Office and state savings

For post office accounts, you should contact [ An Post.
](https://www.anpost.com/Help-Support/Contact-Us)

###  State savings and prize bonds

If the deceased person held prize bonds and no other State Savings products,
then you should send a letter notifying of the holder's death and the
documents listed below to: State Savings, Prize Bonds, Fexco Centre,
Killorglin, FREEPOST, Co. Kerry, V93 WN9T.

If they had other state savings, you should notify [ An Post
](https://www.anpost.com/Help-Support/Contact-Us) .

##  Credit union accounts

If the deceased person had a credit union account and completed a valid
nomination form when opening the account, the money in the account, up to a
maximum of €27,000, goes to the nominated person or persons.

Any remaining balance forms part of the deceased’s estate and is distributed
in accordance with the person’s will or the [ law on succession
](/en/death/the-deceaseds-estate/what-happens-the-deceaseds-estate/) .

##  Insurance policies

If an insurance policy names you as the beneficiary, then you may claim it
directly from the insurance company. You need a death certificate. If there is
no named beneficiary, then the proceeds form part of the overall estate of the
deceased and are distributed with the other assets. Find out about [ different
types of insurance here ](/en/money-and-tax/personal-
finance/insurance/insurance/) .

##  Occupational and personal pensions

The rules governing [ occupational pensions ](/en/money-and-tax/personal-
finance/pensions/occupational-pensions/) and personal pensions depend on the
terms of the pension. If your loved one was a member of a pension scheme, you
should contact the scheme administrators to find out if there is a pension for
the spouse, civil partner and/or children. Self-employed people may have
pension arrangements that involve some of the investments becoming part of the
estate when the person dies.

Divorced people and people whose civil partnership has been dissolved may have
[ access to some part of the pension scheme ](/en/birth-family-
relationships/separation-and-divorce/sep-divorce-pensions/) depending on
whether a pension adjustment order was made at the time of the divorce or
dissolution.
