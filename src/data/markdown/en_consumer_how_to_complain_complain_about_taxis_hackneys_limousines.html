#  Complain about a taxi, hackney or limousine

  * Introduction 
  * Who to complain to 
  * Complain to the dispatch operator 
  * Complain to the National Transport Authority 
  * Contact the NTA 

##  Introduction

Taxis, hackneys and limousines are types of ‘small public service vehicles’ or
SPSVs. Drivers of SPSVs must have a licence to carry passengers and the car
they are using must be licenced too.

The National Transport Authority (NTA) is the regulator of SPSVs and it has a
complaints process you can use if you have a bad experience with a licenced
taxi, limousine or hackney service.

##  Who to complain to

If you booked the service through a dispatch operator, complain first to the
dispatch operator – see below.

If your complaint involves a criminal offence, contact your local Garda
Station.

If you want to complain because your driver was smoking, you should contact
the National Tobacco Control Office, HSE 1890 333 100. [ Environmental Health
Officers ](http://www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/1/environ/Contact.html) of the
HSE enforce most of the tobacco control legislation.

##  Complain to the dispatch operator

/'If you booked through a dispatch operator (including taxi booking apps), you
should complain to the operator first. In some situations, discussing the
problem with the manager or a senior staff member at the company can resolve
your complaint.

If you prefer to make a more formal complaint, or you are not happy with the
response to your informal complaint, you can put your complaint in writing to
the dispatch operator.

If this does not resolve your complaint, you can make a complaint to the
National Transport Authority.

##  Complain to the National Transport Authority

###  **What you can complain about**

You can complain to the NTA about:

  * The condition, roadworthiness and cleanliness of the vehicle 
  * The conduct of a driver 
  * Overcharging or other issues relating to fares charged by a driver 
  * Problems with your taxi, hackney or limousine booking 
  * The identification on display by the driver and the signage used by the car (for taxis) 

The type of complaints that may be made to the National Transport Authority is
set out in [ section 64 of the Taxi Regulation Act 2013
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2013/act/37/section/64/enacted/en/html#sec64)
.

###  **How to complain**

You can [ make your complaint online
](http://transportforireland.ie/taxi/taxi-compliments-complaints/) . The NTA
also has an information line on 0818 064 000.

Remember to give all relevant details about the incident and include a copy of
your receipt (if you got one).

Give as much information about the driver and the vehicle you are complaining
about. The NTA will need it to identify the driver and investigate your
complaint.

###  **How your complaint is dealt with**

Your complaint will be investigated by the NTA’s enforcement team. If there is
a dispute, the investigators will examine the evidence provided by all
parties.

Once this evidence has been collected and evaluated, the NTA will issue its
decision.

The NTA could decide to:

  * Take no more action 
  * Give advice to the operator 
  * Issue a formal warning 
  * Escalate the complaint for prosecution in court 

You may have to attend court to give evidence regarding the incident. You
cannot make a complaint anonymously.
