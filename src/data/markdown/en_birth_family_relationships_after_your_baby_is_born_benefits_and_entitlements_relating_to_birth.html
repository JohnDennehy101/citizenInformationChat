#  Benefits and entitlements relating to birth and children

  * Introduction 
  * Before your baby is born 
  * After your baby is born 

##  Introduction

If you are having a baby in Ireland, there is a range of supports for parents
and children. This page gives a general overview of these supports.

##  Before your baby is born

###  Health and safety

If you become pregnant while in employment and you are exposed to certain
risks in the workplace, or you are involved in _nightwork_ (nightwork means
that you spend at least three hours or 50% of your work between midnight-7am),
you may be entitled to [ health and safety leave ](/en/employment/employment-
rights-and-conditions/health-and-safety/health-safety-work/) from work. If you
are entitled to health and safety leave and you have enough social insurance
(PRSI) contributions, you may qualify for [ Health and Safety Benefit
](/en/social-welfare/families-and-children/health-safety-benefit/) during your
leave. If you are breastfeeding at work, you may also be entitled to health
and safety leave and Health and Safety Benefit.

###  Antenatal visits or appointments

After your pregnancy is confirmed, you may take time off for medical visits
(sometimes called [ antenatal visits or appointments ](/en/birth-family-
relationships/before-your-baby-is-born/antenatal-visits/) ) connected with the
pregnancy. There is no maximum or minimum amount of time off specified for
these visits. Rather, you are entitled to reasonable time off – this means the
time that you need for each visit and includes both the time required to
travel to and from the appointment and the time for the appointment itself.
You are entitled to be paid during these antenatal visits.

###  Antenatal classes

Antenatal classes give you information about pregnancy, labour and delivery,
and baby care. Before the birth you are entitled to take paid time off work to
attend one set of [ antenatal classes ](/en/birth-family-relationships/before-
your-baby-is-born/antenatal-classes/) (however, not the last 3 in the set).
This is a once-off right which covers all pregnancies while in employment.
Expectant fathers have a once-off right to attend the last 2 antenatal classes
in the set.

##  After your baby is born

###  Maternity leave and Maternity Benefit

If you are working, no matter how long you have been working, you are entitled
to take [ maternity leave ](/en/employment/employment-rights-and-
conditions/leave-and-holidays/maternity-leave/) for a basic period of 26
weeks. At least 2 weeks have to be taken before the end of the week of your
baby's expected birth and at least four weeks after.

If a mother dies within 40 weeks of the birth, the father or other parent is
entitled to maternity leave from work.

During your maternity leave, you may be entitled to [ Maternity Benefit
](/en/social-welfare/families-and-children/maternity-benefit/) if you meet
social insurance contribution conditions.

If you are working and breastfeeding you are entitled to take 1 hour off work
(with pay) each day as a [ breastfeeding break
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/birth-family-relationships/after-your-
baby-is-born/breastfeeding/#1df369) for up to 2 years after birth.

###  Additional (unpaid) maternity leave

You can take up to a further 16 weeks’ additional maternity leave immediately
after your maternity leave ends. This additional maternity leave is often
called ‘unpaid maternity leave’ because you are not covered by Maternity
Benefit and your employer does not have to pay you during it.

###  Paternity leave and Paternity Benefit

New parents (but not the mother of the child) are entitled to 2 weeks' [
paternity leave ](/en/employment/employment-rights-and-conditions/leave-and-
holidays/paternity-leave/) from employment or self-employment following the
birth or adoption of a child. [ Paternity Benefit ](/en/social-
welfare/families-and-children/paternity-benefit/) is a weekly payment to a
parent on paternity leave from work who is covered by social insurance (PRSI).
You can start paternity leave at any time within the first 6 months after the
birth or adoption placement.

###  Adoptive leave and Adoptive Benefit

[ Adoptive leave ](/en/employment/employment-rights-and-conditions/leave-and-
holidays/adoptive-leave/) is a statutory entitlement for adoptive parents.
Adoptive leave provides 24 weeks’ leave from work to one parent of the
adopting couple or a parent who is adopting alone. The 24 weeks start from the
date the child is placed in your care.

If you have enough PRSI contributions, you may be able to get [ Adoptive
Benefit ](/en/social-welfare/families-and-children/adoptive-benefit/) . It is
available to both employees and self-employed people. If you are an adopting
couple, the parent who does not avail of adoptive leave is entitled to [
paternity leave ](/en/employment/employment-rights-and-conditions/leave-and-
holidays/paternity-leave/) .

You can take up to 16 additional weeks’ unpaid adoptive leave but you cannot
claim Adoptive Benefit for these extra weeks.

###  Parent’s leave and Parent’s Benefit

[ Parent’s leave
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/employment/employment-rights-and-
conditions/leave-and-holidays/parents-leave/) is a statutory entitlement for
working parents. The leave lets parents spend more time with their baby or
adopted child during the first two years. From August 2024, each parent is
entitled to 9 weeks of parent’s leave for a child born or adopted on or after
1 August 2024, a child who is under the age of 2 on 1 August 2024 or an
adopted child who has been placed with the family less than 2 years on 1
August 2024.

The leave period remains the same in the case of multiple births, for example,
if you have twins or if you adopt 2 or more children at the same time.
Parent’s leave is available to both employees and people who are self-
employed.

[ Parent’s Benefit ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-
welfare/social-welfare-payments/families-and-children/parents-benefit/) is
paid while you are on parent’s leave from work if you have enough social
insurance (PRSI) contributions.

###  Parental leave

When you return to work you may be able to take [ parental leave
](/en/employment/employment-rights-and-conditions/leave-and-holidays/parental-
leave/) . Both parents are entitled to take 26 weeks of parental leave for
each eligible child. You must take parental leave before your child’s 12th
birthday. Parental leave is unpaid. Generally, you must have been working for
your employer for a year before you can take parental leave.

###  **Leave for medical care reasons**

From 3 July 2023, you can take unpaid leave if you need to take time off to
deal with medical care for your child or other relevant person. You can take
up to 5 days' leave for medical care in any 12 consecutive months. Read more
about [ unpaid leave for medical care ](/en/employment/employment-rights-and-
conditions/leave-and-holidays/unpaid-leave-for-medical-care/) .

###  Child Benefit

[ Child Benefit ](/en/social-welfare/families-and-children/child-benefit/) is
a monthly payment to the parents or guardians of children under 16 years of
age. You can get Child Benefit for children aged 16 and 17, if they are in
full-time education or full-time training, or have a disability and cannot
support themselves.

From 1 May 2024, Child Benefit will be extended to children aged 18 who are in
full-time education or who have a disability until their 19th birthday.

In general, Child Benefit is payable from the first day of the month after the
child is born. It is paid at higher rates for multiple births such as twins or
triplets.

###  Free GP visits for children under 8

The [ GP visit card for children under 8 ](/en/health/medical-cards-and-gp-
visit-cards/gp-visit-cards-for-under-8s/) covers free GP visits, including
home visits and urgent out of hours GP care. If your child already has a
medical card, you do not need to register them for a GP visit card. However,
if your family circumstances change and your family is no longer eligible for
medical cards, you can then register your children for GP visit cards for
children under 8.

###  Taxes

There are no specific tax reliefs for children. However, the [ Single Person
Child Carer Credit ](/en/money-and-tax/tax/income-tax-credits-and-
reliefs/single-person-child-carer-tax-credit/) is a tax credit for people who
are caring for children on their own. There is also an [ Incapacitated Child
Tax Credit ](/en/money-and-tax/tax/tax-credits-and-reliefs-for-people-with-
disabilities/incapacitated-child-tax-credit/) if your child is permanently
incapacitated and a [ Home Carer Tax Credit ](/en/money-and-tax/tax/income-
tax-credits-and-reliefs/home-carers-tax-credit/) where one spouse is caring
for a child or dependant person. There are also other [ tax credits and
allowances ](/en/money-and-tax/tax/income-tax-credits-and-
reliefs/introduction-to-income-tax-credits-and-reliefs/) which families can
avail of.

###  Social welfare supports

The Department of Social Protection provides [ social welfare payments to
support families with children ](/en/social-welfare/families-and-
children/payments-to-families-and-children/) for people in low-paid employment
and people parenting alone. Some payments are means-tested and others are
based on social insurance contributions.

If you are a [ medical card holder ](/en/health/medical-cards-and-gp-visit-
cards/medical-card/) you are entitled to a Maternity Cash Grant of €10.16 from
the Health Service Executive on the birth of your child. Apply to your [ Local
Health Office ](http://www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/1/LHO/) .

If you cannot pay for the extra costs associated with your baby you may be
able to apply for an [ Exceptional Needs Payment ](/en/social-
welfare/supplementary-welfare-schemes/additional-needs-payment/) from the
Department of Social Protection.

###  Early childhood care and pre-school education

The [ Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) Scheme ](/en/education/pre-
school-education-and-childcare/early-childhood-care-and-education-scheme/)
provides free early childhood care and education for 2 years for children of
pre-school age for a set number of hours over a set period of weeks from
September to June (the school year).

The new [ National Childcare Scheme (NCS) ](/en/education/pre-school-
education-and-childcare/national-childcare-scheme/) ‘wraps-around’ the free
pre-school programme, providing financial support towards the cost of
childcare for the hours spent outside of pre-school. The National Childcare
Scheme provides 2 types of childcare subsidy paid directly to your chosen
childcare provider. Children must be attending a childcare provider registered
with [ Tusla ](/en/birth-family-relationships/services-and-supports-for-
children/tusla-the-child-and-family-agency/) (including childminders and
school-age childcare services).
