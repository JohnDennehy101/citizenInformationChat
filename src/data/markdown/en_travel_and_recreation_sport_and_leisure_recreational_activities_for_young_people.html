#  Recreational activities for young people

  * Introduction 
  * National Recreational Policy 
  * Recreational activities 

##  Introduction

Play and recreation are important for a young person’s well-being. The
Government has a National Recreational Policy for young people.

This page outlines some of the supports available.

##  National Recreational Policy

[ Teenspace \- the National Recreation Policy for Young People
](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/9bac93-teenspace-national-recreation-
policy-for-young-people/) helps promote appropriate recreational opportunities
for young people between the ages of 12 and 18.

The policy aims to cover both organised activities as well as the more casual
activities (skateboarding, biking, and using the internet), that young people
like to get involved with.

###  Youth cafés

There is a [ Youth café toolkit - how to set up and run a youth café in
Ireland (pdf) ](https://www.drugsandalcohol.ie/13317/1/Youth_Cafe_Toolkit.pdf)
.

###  Local Authority Play and Recreation Network

The [ Local Authority Play and Recreation Network (LAPRN)
](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/364bef-local-authority-play-and-
recreation-network-laprn/) gives a more coordinated and interagency approach
to achieving the main goals of the play and recreation policies at both the
national and local levels.

The network has an annual [ National Recreation Week
](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/8f7d0e-play-and-recreation-
schemes/#national-recreation-week) . Funding is available to each local
authority up to €1,700. There is also funding available to help promote a [
National Play Day. ](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/8f7d0e-play-and-
recreation-schemes/#national-play-day)

###  Funding programmes

The Department provides support to community and voluntary organisations
providing youth services, including recreational activities, through its [
grants and funding programmes ](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/8f7d0e-play-
and-recreation-schemes/) .

Under the Grant Scheme up to €20,000 is allocated to each local authority. The
funding is for new facilities, equipment, the design and/or the use of non-
traditional spaces. It is also for refurbishment costs or the upgrading of
existing play and recreation facilities.

###  Youth arts

In partnership with the Department and the Arts Council, the National Youth
Council of Ireland operates a [ youth arts programme
](http://www.youtharts.ie/) to promote and develop youth arts.

###  Local Sports Partnerships

Sport Ireland has developed a network of [ Local Sports Partnerships
](https://www.sportireland.ie/participation/lsp-contact-finder) to promote
participation in sports.

##  Recreational activities

Community and voluntary organisations are major providers of recreational
activities for young people. They run sports clubs, youth clubs and various
other youth services.

[ Local authorities ](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/942f74-local-
authorities/) provide information on recreational and cultural facilities on
their websites.

###  Sports

Sport Ireland provides support to the National Governing Bodies of the various
sports available in Ireland. Contact details for the [ National Governing
Bodies ](https://www.sportireland.ie/national-governing-bodies) are available
on its website.

###  Youth clubs and cafés

The National Youth Council of Ireland (NYCI) is the representative body for
national voluntary youth work organisations. [ Information on its members and
their activities ](http://www.youth.ie/members) is available on its website.

###  Volunteering

Volunteer Ireland provides [ advice for young people who are interested in
volunteering ](https://www.volunteer.ie/volunteers/) . It also provides [
contact details for the network of Volunteer Centres
](https://www.volunteer.ie/your-local-volunteer-centre/?type=for_volunteers) .
Volunteer Centres provide a placement service between individuals who want to
volunteer and organisations that want volunteers.

###  President's Award

The President's Award is the National Challenge Award for young people between
the ages of 15 and 25 years. The purpose of the award is to reward young
people who have set and achieved a demanding challenge for themselves in each
of the 4 different areas of activity. Find out more in our page on the [
President’s Award ](/en/government-in-ireland/houses-of-the-
oireachtas/presidents-award-gaisce/) .
