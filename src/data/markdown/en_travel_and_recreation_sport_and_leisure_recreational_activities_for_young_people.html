##  Introduction

Play and recreation are important for a young person’s well-being. The
Government has a National Recreational Policy for young people.

##  National Recreational Policy

[ Teenspace \- the National Recreation Policy for Young People
](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/9bac93-teenspace-national-recreation-
policy-for-young-people/) helps promote appropriate recreational opportunities
for young people between the ages of 12 and 18.

The policy aims to cover both organised activities as well as the more casual
activities (skateboarding, biking, and using the internet), that young people
like to get involved with.
