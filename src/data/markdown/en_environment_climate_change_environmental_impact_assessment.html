#  Environmental assessments for projects and plans

  * Introduction 
  * What is an Environmental Impact Assessment? 
  * What is a Strategic Environmental Assessment? 

##  Introduction

The environmental impact of certain projects, plans and programmes must be
assessed before they can go ahead. EU legislation requires that EU member
states complete an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIR) or a Strategic
Environmental Assessment (SEA) for certain projects, plans and programmes. An
EIA is used to identify the environmental and social impacts of a proposed
project before a decision is made about the project. An SEA is used to assess
the environmental effect of a plan at public policy and planning levels.  

##  What is an Environmental Impact Assessment?

EU member states must carry out assessments of the environmental impact of
certain public and private projects before they are allowed to progress. The
Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) process ensures that projects that are
likely to have a significant effect on the environment, are assessed in
advance, so that people are aware of what those effects are likely to be. The
assessment **must** be carried out for certain projects including:

  * Motorways 
  * Large scale developments in agriculture 
  * Food industry developments 
  * Chemical industry developments 
  * Infrastructure and urban development 

The full list of projects that need an EIA are listed in Annex I of the [
Environmental Impact Assessment Directive
](https://ec.europa.eu/environment/eia/pdf/EIA_Directive_informal.pdf) , as
amended. Each Member State decides on a case-by-case basis, whether Annex II
projects need an EIA. The Environmental Impact Assessment Directive [ has been
amended and revised a number of times
](https://ec.europa.eu/environment/eia/eia-legalcontext.htm) to bring it in
line with subsequent European environmental policy. This EU legislation was
implemented in Ireland by the Planning and Development Acts 2000-2020, as well
as a number of Planning and Development Regulations and European Communities
(Environmental Impact Assessment) Regulations.

###  Environmental Impact Assessment Report

When submitting a planning application for a development that needs an EIA,
the applicant must also submit an Environmental Impact Assessment Report
(EIAR). The regulations set thresholds above which an EIAR is required.

The local authority (or An Bord Pleanála) can ask a developer for an EIAR even
if their development is below the thresholds. They will do this if they think
the development is likely to have a significant effect on the environment. The
full list of projects and threshold limits are set out in the Planning and
Development Regulations.

The EIAR is drawn up by the developer and must contain an analysis of the
likely effects (positive and negative), of a proposed development on the
environment. This includes the likely effects on:

  * People 
  * Flora 
  * Fauna 
  * Soil 
  * Water 
  * Air 
  * Landscape 
  * Cultural heritage 

The EIAR also sets out how the developer proposes to deal with any negative
effects. The EIAR must include a non-technical summary. The Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA) has published [ guidelines
](https://www.epa.ie/pubs/advice/ea/EPA%20EIAR%20Guidelines.pdf) on the
information to be contained in an Environmental Impact Assessment Report.

It is not possible to get outline planning permission for developments covered
by the EIA. The notices about the application for planning permission must
include the fact that an EIAR is available. The local authority’s weekly list
of planning applications must also identify those applications involving an
EIAR.

You may get a copy of any EIAR used in a planning application from the [ local
authority ](https://www.housing.gov.ie/local-government/administration/local-
authorities/local-authorities) or [ An Bord Pleanála
](http://www.pleanala.ie/) . You may comment on an EIAR in the same way as any
other aspect of a planning application.

###  The licensing system

If the planning application for a development requires an EIAR to be attached,
then the EIAR must also be included in the application for a licence from the
EPA. The local authority must notify the EPA of any planning application
involving a development which needs an Integrated Pollution Control (IPC)
licence. The EPA then has 5 weeks to comment on the application.

If the local authority decides to give planning permission for such a
development, it cannot impose conditions relating to the control of emissions.
This is for the EPA. It can, however, refuse permission on environmental
grounds (even if the EPA is prepared to grant a licence).

##  What is a Strategic Environmental Assessment?

Public plans and programmes that are likely to have significant effects on the
environment must have a Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA). The SEA
ensures that these plans and programmes are assessed for their environmental
effect before they are adopted. The SEA Directive applies to a number of
sectors including:

  * Agriculture 
  * Forestry 
  * Fisheries 
  * Energy 
  * Industry 
  * Transport 
  * Waste management 
  * Water management 
  * Telecommunications 
  * Tourism 
  * Land use planning 

The SEA Directive (2001/42/EC) is implemented in Ireland by the [ European
Communities (Environmental Assessment of Certain Plans and Programmes)
Regulations 2004 ](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2004/en/si/0435.html) (SI
435/2004) and the [ Planning and Development (Strategic Environmental
Assessment) Regulations 2004
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2004/en/si/0436.html) (SI 436/ 2004) as
amended by SI 200/2011 and SI 201/2011.

This legislation implements the following aspects of the SEA Directive:

  * The review, preparation and variation of a development plan 
  * The preparation or amendment of a local area plan 
  * The review or making of regional planning guidelines 
  * The making of a planning scheme in respect of part or all of a Strategic Development Zone (SDZ). 

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) must be consulted on all plans and
programmes that need an SEA, and at each stage of the SEA process. The EPA has
published [ SEA resource and guidance documents
](https://www.epa.ie/monitoringassessment/assessment/sea/process/) , as well
as detailed information about the [ SEA process
](https://www.epa.ie/monitoringassessment/assessment/sea/process/) .
