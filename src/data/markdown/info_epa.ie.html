[ Frequently Asked Questions ](https://www.epa.ie/resources/faqs/)

Popular FAQ's

  * When is the application of fertiliser (chemical, organic fertiliser (other than farmyard manure) and farmyard manure) to land prohibited? 

The periods when the application of fertilisers to land is prohibited are
specified in Schedule 4 of the European Union (Good Agricultural Practice for
Protection of Waters) Regulations 2014 as follows:

**1.** In counties Carlow, Cork, Dublin, Kildare, Kilkenny, Laois, Offaly,
Tipperary, Waterford, Wexford and Wicklow, the period during which the
application of fertilisers to land is prohibited is the period from—

(a) 15 September to 12 January in the case of the application of chemical
fertiliser

(b) 15 October to 12 January in the case of the application of organic
fertiliser (other than farmyard manure)

(c) 1 November to 12 January in the case of the application of farmyard
manure.

**2.** In counties Clare, Galway, Kerry, Limerick, Longford, Louth, Mayo,
Meath, Roscommon, Sligo and Westmeath, the period during which the application
of fertilisers to land is prohibited is the period from—

(a) 15 September to 15 January in the case of the application of chemical
fertiliser

(b) 15 October to 15 January in the case of the application of organic
fertiliser (other than farmyard manure)

(c) 1 November to 15 January in the case of the application of farmyard
manure.

**3.** In counties Cavan, Donegal, Leitrim and Monaghan, the period during
which the application of fertilisers to land is prohibited is the period from—

(a) 15 September to 31 January in the case of the application of chemical
fertiliser

(b) 15 October to 31 January in the case of the application of organic
fertiliser (other than farmyard manure)

(c) 1 November to 31 January in the case of the application of farmyard
manure.

  * Is it safe to store chemicals (e.g. fertilisers, paints, diesel, pesticides, bleach etc.) near my well? 

No. Chemicals should be stored in a safe place away from any wellhead or the
contributory zone (catchment) from the water supply so that accidental
spillage will not result in the chemicals getting into your well and causing
contamination.

  * I think my well is being contaminated by nearby activity, what can I do? 

The first step is to talk to your neighbour about the suspected cause of
contamination. It may be that your neighbour is unaware of the location of
your well or the consequences of their actions. If this fails you should make
your complaint in writing to the relevant local authority or use the EPA “See
It, Say It” app to report the incident.

  * My well is contaminated what should I do? 

You should check your well to see if there are any obvious signs of
contamination such as recent landspreading or cattle too close to your well.
Protecting the catchment area of your well is one of the best ways to protect
the quality of your water. You should also check to see is there any ingress
of water into the borehole.

If your well is contaminated with _E. coli_ or Coliform Bacteria you should
boil the drinking water from the well until you are sure it is safe to drink
and cook with.

You should sterilise your well (see How do I disinfect my well question) and
see if this resolves the contamination (after retesting). If this is not
successful in restoring the quality of your water you may need to consider
improving the protection of your well and/or installing an appropriate
treatment system. Once-off disinfection cannot replace a treatment system if
your supply is always or often contaminated.

If your well is contaminated with a chemical parameter you should contact your
local authority for advice in the first instance.

You may also consider connecting to a public or group water scheme.

  * I am using a deep well, how can it be contaminated? 

While a shallow well is likely to be vulnerable to contamination, a deep well
is not necessarily protected against contamination. Contamination can travel
over the top of the well casing (e.g. if the wellhead is below ground), down
the sides of the casing (if not properly sealed) or can travel through the
soil into the well. Contamination of groundwater through abandoned boreholes
nearby is another potential risk. Unless the well is properly constructed,
sealed and cased then it may be vulnerable to contamination from contaminated
water from the surface.
