#  Writs and pleadings

  * Information 
  * District Court cases 
  * Circuit Court and High Court cases 
  * Further information 

##  Information

Pleadings (sometimes called _writs_ ) are court documents that are exchanged
by the parties in a case. If the case is a [ High Court ](/en/justice/courts-
system/high-court/) or [ Circuit Court ](/en/justice/courts-system/circuit-
court/) case, the [ solicitor ](/en/justice/courtroom/solicitors/) will
usually appoint a [ barrister ](/en/justice/courtroom/barristers/) to draft
the pleadings in the case.

The person who is bringing the case, that is, the person who is suing, is
known as the _plaintiff_ or _claimant_ . The person who is being sued is known
as the _defendant_ or _respondent_ .

If you receive a writ or pleading that was sent to you in error, you should
contact the solicitor whose name appears on the document.

##  District Court cases

If the claimant wishes to _commence proceedings_ (that is, to start the legal
action) in the District Court, their solicitor prepares and serves a _claim
notice_ on the respondent.

The respondent (or their solicitor) then gives or sends to the claimant (or
their solicitor) an _appearance and defence_ to show that they intend to
defend the case.

If the respondent believes that they actually have a claim against the
claimant, the respondent includes in the appearance and defence a _statement
of counterclaim_ setting out their claim against the claimant.

There is more information in our document on [ District Court procedures
](/en/justice/civil-law/district-court-procedures/) .

##  Circuit Court and High Court cases

To commence proceedings the plaintiff's barrister generally prepares a _Civil
Bill_ if the case is a Circuit Court case or an _originating summons_ if the
case is a High Court case.

The purpose of these documents is to state the case being made against the
defendant. For example, if the case is about a road traffic accident, the writ
should clearly set out the circumstances of the accident and why and how the
defendant is at fault. The document also sets out in detail the injuries that
the plaintiff suffered.

When the defendant receives the Civil Bill or originating summons, they must
_enter an appearance_ to show that they are now a party to the case and intend
to defend it.

If it is a High Court case, the plaintiff may then have to send a _statement
of claim_ to the defendant.

The defendant may send the plaintiff a _Notice for Particulars_ requesting
further details and more information.

When the defendant has received _Replies to Particulars_ , they issue their
_Defence_ , setting out why the defendant is not to blame. If the defendant
believes that they actually have a claim against the plaintiff, the defendant
includes a _counterclaim_ with the Defence setting out their claim against the
plaintiff.

procedures ](/en/justice/civil-law/circuit-court-procedures/) and [ High Court
procedures ](/en/justice/civil-law/high-court-procedures/) .
