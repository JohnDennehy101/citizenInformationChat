##  What is the Additional Needs Payment?

The Additional Needs Payment is a payment to help you with an expense that you

You may get an Additional Needs Payment if you are:

  * Getting a social welfare payment, or 
  * Working and on a low income, regardless of the number of hours that you work 

You may get this payment even if you are not getting a social welfare payment.

When you apply for the payment, your income and circumstances will be assessed
to find out if you qualify.

The Additional Needs Payment includes the _Exceptional Needs_ and _Urgent
Needs_ payments.

##  What can I get the Additional Needs Payment for?

You can get the Additional Needs Payment to help you with an expense that you
cannot pay from your weekly income.

For example:

  * An increase in your fuel or electricity costs 
  * Essential repairs to property, including motor vehicles, and replacing household appliances and furniture 
  * Funeral costs 
  * Deposits for private rented accommodation 
  * Bedding and cooking utensils, if you are setting up home for the first time 
  * Food, clothing and shelter after an emergency event such as a fire or flood 
  * Recurring travel costs to hospital for appointments, or for visiting a relative in hospital or prison 
  * Prams, buggies, cots, or essential child safety equipment
