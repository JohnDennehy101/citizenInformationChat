##  COVID-19

The economy is expected to shrink 2.4% in 2020 and 1.7% in 2021 because of the
COVID-19 pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic has also meant that that many people
have lost their jobs or had to close their businesses. €8.5 billion will be
spent on supporting people and businesses affected by COVID-19. In summary,
this includes:

  * €1.9 billion for personal protective equipment (PPE) in the health sector and to increase COVID-19 testing capacity 
  * €3.2 billion to support people through the [ COVID Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP) ](/ga/social-welfare/unemployed-people/covid19-pandemic-unemployment-payment/) and the [ Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) ](/ga/employment/unemployment-and-redundancy/employment-wage-subsidy-scheme/)
  * €100 million to support [ businesses affected ](/ga/employment/types-of-employment/self-employment/covid-19-costas-aisghabhala-tacaiochtai-gno-maireachtala/) by COVID-19 
  * €2.1 billion for a ‘contingency reserve’ for use if needed 
  * Reducing VAT for the tourism and hospitality sectors from 13.5% to 9% 
  * €232 million to help schools make their classrooms safe for students 
  * €395 million to help transport services run at reduced capacity 

A **Recovery Fund** of €3.4 billion will be available to support the economy
where needed in response to both COVID-19 and Brexit (see 'Brexit
preparations' below).

##  Brexit preparations

The Budget has been prepared on the assumption that there will be no bilateral
trade deal between the UK and EU. This would mean that the UK and the EU will
trade on World Trade Organisation (WTO) terms in 2021.

The Budget provides €340 million for [ Brexit measures ](/ga/government-in-
ireland/ireland-and-the-uk/what-is-brexit/) .

Funding will be provided to put in place the controls and checks needed for
agri-food exports to, and imports from, Britain from **1 January 2021** .

Compliance funding will be available to carry out work at ports and airports.
An additional 500 staff will bring the total number of staff to 1,500 for
carrying out checks.

Expenditure of €100 million has been provided to departments for **Brexit
supports** including:

  * €8m for new market surveillance and certification 
  * €15m to help businesses respond to changes to customs and tariffs 
  * €7m to help the food processing industry adapt 
  * €11m for Local Enterprise Offices to work with local businesses 
  * €675,000 for InterTrade Ireland to provide practical help to businesses trading cross-border 

A **new Recovery Fund of €3.4 billion** will allow for specific measures in
response to Brexit and COVID-19 to be introduced as needed. It will focus on
three main areas: infrastructure development, reskilling and retraining,
supporting investment and jobs. This fund will be held in reserve and allows
for flexibility, especially for Brexit provisions where there is still
uncertainly around the outcome of negotiations

##  Taxation

###  Income tax

There are no changes to the **standard or higher rate income tax bands** .

The **Earned Income Tax Credit for the self-employed** will increase from
€1,500 to €1,650. This increase will also be applied for the 2020 tax year.

The **Dependent Relative Tax Credit** will increase from €70 to €245.

###  Universal Social Charge (USC)

The ceiling of the 2% band will increase from €20,484 to €20,687, so that the
salary of a full-time worker on the minimum wage will remain outside the
higher rates of [ USC ](/ga/money-and-tax/tax/income-tax/universal-social-
charge/) .

The weekly income threshold for the **higher rate of employer’s PRSI** will
increase from €394 to €398 to ensure that there is no incentive to reduce the
working hours for a full-time employee on the increased minimum wage.

Medical card holders will continue to pay a reduced rate of USC until the end
of December 2021.

###  Excise duties

From midnight on 13 October 2020, the excise duty on a packet of 20 cigarettes
will increase by 50 cent (including VAT) with a pro-rata increase on other
tobacco products.

###  Carbon tax

The [ carbon tax ](/ga/money-and-tax/tax/motor-carbon-other-taxes/carbon-tax/)
on fuel will increase by €7.50 from €26 per tonne to €33.50 per tonne. The
increase will apply to auto fuels from midnight on 13 October 2020 and to
solid fuels from May 2021. See 'Environment' below for more details.

###  Vehicle Registration Tax (VRT) and motor tax

New rates tables for [ VRT ](/ga/moving-country/moving-to-ireland/coming-to-
live-in-ireland/importing-car-into-ireland/) and [ motor tax ](/ga/travel-and-
recreation/motoring/motor-tax-and-insurance/ratai-motarchanach/) will be
introduced. The CO2-based VRT and motor tax regimes will be replaced with the
**new Worldwide Harmonised Light Vehicle Test Procedure (WLTP) emissions
system** from January 2021. See 'Transport' below for details of changes to
VRT and motor taxes.

###  Remote working tax credit

The **cost of broadband** may be covered as an allowable home expense for [
tax relief for e-working ](/ga/money-and-tax/tax/income-tax-credits-and-
reliefs/eworking-and-tax-relief/) . Other vouched expenses may also be covered
where they are “wholly, exclusively and necessarily” part of the employees
work and the employer does not make payment towards the expense. Further
information will be available shortly from Revenue.

###  Debt warehousing for self-assessed taxpayers

The **tax debt warehousing scheme** will be extended to taxpayers who self-
assess for income tax that are adversely impacted by Covid-19. Impacted
taxpayers who cannot pay their 2019 balance and preliminary tax for 2020 can
defer payment for 12 months. If income for 2021 is also at least 25% lower
than income for 2019, the balance of 2020 balance and 2021 Preliminary Tax can
also be warehoused. Debts that are warehoused are subject to 0% interest for
12 months. After this 12-month period, a reduced interest rate of 3% per annum
will apply and no surcharge will apply.

###  Other taxation measures

####  Revised CGT entrepreneur’s relief

The holding requirement under the **CGT Entrepreneur Relief** will be amended.
An individual who held at least 5% of the shares for a continuous period of
any 3 years qualifies. This will come into effect from 1 January 2021.

####  Consanguinity relief

Consanguinity stamp duty relief for family farm transfers is being maintained
at 1% for a further 3 years until 31 December 2023.

##  Social welfare

The total social protection budget in 2021 will be €25.126 billion, of this
€3.18 billion is COVID-19 related expenditure.

###  Social welfare payments

There will be no increase in **weekly social welfare payments** .

###  COVID-19 Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP)

An earnings threshold of €480 per month will be introduced for **self-employed
people getting PUP** to allow them to take up occasional work opportunities
and keep their [ PUP ](/ga/social-welfare/unemployed-people/covid19-pandemic-
unemployment-payment/) .

Self-employed people who resume their business on a limited or reduced basis
when they leave PUP will be eligible for the **Part-Time Job Incentive
scheme.**

###  Christmas Bonus

A [ Christmas Bonus ](/ga/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-
system/christmas-bonus/) of 100% will be paid in early December 2020 to people
getting a long-term social welfare payment (minimum payment €20).

The bonus will also be paid to people getting PUP and jobseeker’s payments for
at least 4 months.

family-payment/) income thresholds will increase by €10 per week for families

[ Parent’s Benefit ](/ga/social-welfare/families-and-children/parents-
benefit/) will be extended by 3 weeks from 2 weeks to 5 weeks for parents of
children born or adopted from November 2019. The period it can be taken will
be extended up to your child's second birthday or within 2 years following
adoption (from April 2021).

The [ Widowed or Surviving Civil Partner Grant ](/ga/social-welfare/death-
related-benefits/widowed-parents-bereavement-grant/) will increase by €2,000
from €6,000 to €8,000 (from January 2021).

###  Disability and illness payments

welfare/disability-and-illness/treatment-benefit-scheme/) without requiring a
matching payment by the claimant (from April 2021).
