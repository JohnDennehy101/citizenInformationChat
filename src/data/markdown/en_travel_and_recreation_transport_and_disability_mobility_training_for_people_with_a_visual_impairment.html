[ Vision Ireland ](https://www.ncbi.ie/) (formally National Council for the
Blind) and [ Irish Guide Dogs for the Blind ](https://guidedogs.ie/) offer
training. This page outlines some of these supports and how you can access
them.

##  Orientation and mobility training

[ Vision Ireland provides an orientation and mobility training service
](https://www.ncbi.ie/orientation-and-mobility-solutions/) for people with a
visual impairment. This service can help you learn how to move about safely.
It can help you feel more confident going to your local shop, travelling on
public transport or through crowded streets.

Trainers develop individual mobility programmes to suit each person. You can
learn how to:

  * Maximise your residual vision 
  * Improve your body, spatial and environmental awareness 
  * Use sensory clues 
  * Improve skills at home, work, college or other everyday places, as well as on different routes you would like to become familiar with 
  * Improve your road safety awareness and independent travel skills 

You can find out about the [ supports that Vision Ireland offer on their
website ](https://www.ncbi.ie/supporting-you/) .

###  White canes and walking sticks

Vision Ireland also provide training in how to use a long cane or guide cane.
You can get long canes, symbol canes and white walking sticks from Vision
Ireland

If you have a visual impairment, you may use a white cane or stick. There are
different types of canes and sticks and they have different uses. Some are
designed to help with mobility while others are used to let people know you
have a visual impairment.

  * A **white walking stick** gives you some physical support and lets other people know that you have a visual impairment. It is not a mobility aid. 
  * A **symbol cane** is used to let others know that you have a visual impairment and that you might need assistance. It is not a mobility aid and does not provide physical support. 
  * A **long cane** is a mobility aid designed to help you get around. You sweep the cane from side to side on the ground in front of your body. This helps you locate potential hazards and changes in the texture and level of the ground. You will need training on how to use a long cane. 
  * A **guide cane** is a mobility aid. It is shorter than a long cane and has more limited use. The guide cane can be used in 2 ways, you can hold it in a diagonal position across your lower body for protection, or you can use it to scan for kerbs and steps. It does not give you physical support. You will need training on how to use a guide cane. 

If you have a guide dog or have applied for a guide dog, you can get [
training on how to use a long cane ](https://guidedogs.ie/get-
support/orientation-mobility/) with the Irish Guide Dogs for the Blind. They
will give you one long cane following the training. The Irish Guide Dogs for
the Blind also provide [ independent living skills training
](https://guidedogs.ie/get-support/independent-living/) .

##  Guide dogs and training

Guide dogs can help someone with a visual impairment to get around safely.
Irish Guide Dogs for the Blind provide guide dogs to people with visual
impairments. They also provide training so people can learn how to work with a
guide dog.

Only certain breeds of dogs can become guide dogs in Ireland. The main breeds
used are labradors, golden retrievers, crosses of these breeds and German
shepherd crosses.

Dogs that become guide dogs are trained by Irish Guide Dogs for the Blind.
Puppies are fostered by families for 12 months and are then returned to the
Irish Guide Dogs for the Blind to train for 8 months. A family pet or puppy
cannot be trained to be a guide dog.

###  Guide dog training

You must be at least 16 years old to get a guide dog. However, you can apply
for a guide dog before you are 16 and go on the waiting list.

If your application for a guide dog is successful, you will be placed on a
waiting list. Then, when a dog becomes available that matches your needs, you
will be given training in how to use the dog.

You will need to attend a 3-week residential training programme at the Irish
Guide Dogs training centre. The instructors will work with you and your dog on
everyday skills, from crossing roads to using public transport. They also
provide training on dog handling, feeding, grooming and vet care.

Irish Guide Dogs for the Blind do not charge for training courses or
equipment. However, you must pay €10 per week for board and lodging on their
residential training courses.

When you finish the training you can bring your guide dog home and an
instructor will call in to help with the ‘settling in process’. You will get
regular support from your instructor after the course.

You can get [ more information about training a guide dog on guidedogs.ie
