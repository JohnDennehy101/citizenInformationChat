##  Introduction

Iarnród Éireann (or Irish Rail), a subsidiary company of a State-owned
company, Coras Iompair Éireann (CIÉ), is responsible for operating rail
services. Iarnród Éireann falls under the remit of the Department of
Transport. The company operates passenger rail services nationwide and
provides commuter rail services, including the DART service in Dublin.

Many stations have _park and ride_ facilities to encourage commuters to leave
their cars in [ station car parks ](https://www.irishrail.ie/Travel-
Information/Station-Car-Parking) and reduce the volume of traffic.

Free travel on State rail services is available to everyone permanently living
in Ireland that is aged 66 and over. Certain people under that age are also
entitled. [ Get more information about Free Travel ](/en/social-welfare/extra-
social-welfare-benefits/free-travel/) .

###  **Fares on public transport**

Most [ reduced fares of 20% on public transport will continue in 2024
](https://www.gov.ie/en/press-release/5c270-budget-2024-to-deliver-further-
reductions-in-fares-and-introduce-new-services-for-families-and-commuters/) .
The 50% price reduction on the Young Adult Leap Card continues in 2024. You
can see the [ National Transport Authority Fare (NTA) Plan 2024

determination-to-take-effect-from-23rd-june/) on some services.

us/dart-commuter) runs along the east coast of Ireland from Malahide in county
Dublin to Greystones in county Wicklow. Find [ details of the facilities

destinations: Belfast, Sligo, Ballina, Westport, Galway, Limerick, Ennis,
Tralee, Cork, Waterford and Rosslare Europort. The Enterprise service operates
between Belfast and Dublin and is jointly run by Iarnród Éireann and Northern
Ireland Rail.

Other InterCity services run between Rosslare Europort and Limerick; Cork and
Tralee; Cork and Limerick; and Limerick and Galway. The InterCity service has
carriages divided between first class and standard class.

###  European Rail

](https://www.irishrail.ie/rail-fares-and-tickets/sailrail-uk-ferry) and for [
European rail services ](https://www.irishrail.ie/rail-fares-and-

full fare ticket and receive another one free of charge. You must produce your
Companion Free Travel Pass when booking to avail of discount. Details are

##  Services for passengers with disabilities

Special arrangements can be made for passengers with disabilities, but it is
recommended that you contact the relevant station or Iarnród Éireann's
Mobility Impaired Liaison Office at least 24 hours before your journey and
give them some details of your travel plans.

DART trains can be accessed directly from platforms and the trains have wide
doors and a large area to accommodate wheelchairs.

Most mainline and suburban and all DART stations have public address systems
giving details of trains and services for people with visual impairments. You
can read more in our page about [ travelling on public transport with a
disability or reduced mobility ](/en/travel-and-recreation/public-
transport/travelling-publictransport-with-disability/) .

###  Animals

Guide and assistance dogs are permitted to travel on all services without
restriction. [ Pets ](http://www.irishrail.ie/travel-information/travelling-
with-animals) are allowed to travel on DART or commuter trains provided they
are properly restrained. Dogs can only travel on intercity trains in the
guard's van (non-passenger compartment).

###  Luggage

[ Luggage ](http://www.irishrail.ie/travel-information/luggage) should be
placed in the specially provided luggage racks, overhead racks or _in-between
seat_ spaces. You must also make sure your luggage is not causing
inconvenience for other passengers. [ Information on carrying bicycles on
trains ](http://www.irishrail.ie/travel-information/bicycle-information) is
available on the Iarnród Éireann website.

###  Complaints

If you have [ complaints about Iarnród Éireann services
](http://www.irishrail.ie/travel-information/irish-domestic-rail-
travel#puttingthingsright) , you should bring them to the attention of the
relevant station manager. If you want to take your complaint further, you can
contact Customer Relations, Connolly Station, Dublin 1. It is recommended that
you write a letter of complaint, including as much detail as possible (date
and time of travel, where you were travelling from and to and a phone number).
You should also send your ticket, if you still have it. You may get an
immediate response to your complaint but if not, you will get an
acknowledgement within 3 days and you should have a full response within 15
days. You may also [ make complaints or raise customer services issues online
](http://www.irishrail.ie/contact-us) .

###  Compensation and refunds

If your service is seriously delayed for any reason within the control of
Iarnród Éireann, you could be [ entitled to a discount voucher
](http://www.irishrail.ie/travel-information/irish-domestic-rail-
travel#compensation) . The value of discount voucher is based on the length of
delay and the fare you have paid for your single journey (that is,
approximately half the value of a return fare).

Refunds in discount vouchers are also given if your seat reservation is not
honoured and no seat of the same standard is available to you.

If the train you planned to catch is delayed or cancelled and you decide not
to travel, you will be given a full cash refund if you return your unused
ticket immediately to the ticket office where you bought it.

If you decide for some other reason not to use a rail ticket you have bought,
you can [ apply for a refund ](http://www.irishrail.ie/travel-
information/irish-domestic-rail-travel#refunds) at any main InterCity station,
the Dart office in Pearse Station or any Travel Centre. There may be an
administration fee. If you did not buy your ticket from Iarnród Éireann, you
should return it to the place where you bought it. The ticket issuer will
arrange any refund due and may make a reasonable administration charge.

###  Lost property

Each train station has a lost property office where items found on trains will
be handed in and kept for collection. For more details, you should [ contact
the relevant station ](http://www.irishrail.ie/travel-information/find-a-
station) directly.
