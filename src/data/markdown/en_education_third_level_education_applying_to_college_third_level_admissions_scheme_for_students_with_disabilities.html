##  What is DARE?

The Disability Access Route to Education (DARE) supports students with
disabilities to access college.

There are several support systems for students with disabilities who are
undertaking courses at third level. Many third-level colleges have a
disability or access service which is responsible for giving support and
advice to students with disabilities.

The Association for Higher Education Access and Disability (AHEAD) has
information about [ student services ](http://www.ahead.ie/studentservices) .
It also has information about [ accessing college
](http://www.ahead.ie/accessingcollege) .

**DARE 2024-2025**

You must apply for CAO by 5pm, 1 February 2024. You must submit your completed
application for DARE by 5pm, 1 March 2024. You must submit all your supporting
documents by 5pm, 15 March 2024.

###  Telling the college about your disability

If you have a disability, a specific learning difficulty or a significant
ongoing illness, you can let the third-level institution know about it -
either during the application process or at any time during your course - so
that they can consider, in consultation with yourself, any specific support
needs you may have in college.

If you choose to give this information during the application process (though
you are not obliged to do this) you should tick the relevant box on your
application form to the Central Applications Office (CAO). Giving this
information on the form will not adversely affect your application in any way.
In fact, it is by ticking this box that you get the option of the Disability
Access Route to Education - see below.  

##  How the DARE scheme works

The [ Disability Access Route to Education
](http://www.accesscollege.ie/dare/index.php) (DARE) aims to improve access to
college for school-leavers with a disability or specific learning difficulty
by allocating a number of third-level places to them on a reduced points
basis.

##  How to qualify for DARE

If your disability has negatively affected your second-level education, you
may qualify for DARE. To be considered for DARE, you must:

  * Be aged under 23 on 1 January of the year the course starts 
  * You must provide [ information about your disability ](http://accesscollege.ie/dare/providing-evidence-of-your-disability/)
  * You must provide [ information about how your disability has affected your education ](http://accesscollege.ie/dare/making-an-application/educational-impact/)

Read more in ‘How to apply for DARE’ below.

When you have been accepted as eligible for DARE, you then compete for the
reduced point places based on your Leaving Certificate results.

A reduced point place means that you may get a place on a third-level course
with fewer than the full CAO points. For example, if you are eligible for DARE
and you get 350 Leaving Certificate points, you may be offered a place on a
course that requires 360 points through the standard CAO procedure. However,
you must meet the college matriculation requirements and any specific course
entry requirements.

Each of the third-level colleges participating in the scheme has reserved a
number of course places for school-leavers who are eligible for DARE. You can
find details of the places available through DARE on the [ websites of the
participating third-level colleges.
](http://accesscollege.ie/dare/participating-colleges/)

###  Additional supports

Whether you apply for college through DARE or through the standard CAO
procedure, there are supports for student with disabilities while they are at
college.

Supports available vary from college to college but may include:

  * Orientation programme 
  * Study skills and extra tuition if required 
  * Access to assistive technology and training 
  * Mentoring. 

##  How to apply for DARE

If you wish to apply for a college place under the DARE scheme you should
apply through the [ Central Applications Office (CAO)
](http://www.cao.ie/index.php) . When you are filling in the CAO form online
you must complete the part of the form to say that you have a disability or
specific learning difficulty.

You will then be directed to the separate online Supplementary Information
Form.

You can request a paper version of the form from the CAO.

The Supplementary Information Form has 3 sections:

  * **Section A** asks for information on your disability and if you wish to be considered for DARE. 
  * **Section B** is an [ Educational Impact Statement ](http://accesscollege.ie/dare/making-an-application/educational-impact/) , to be completed by your school. It provides information about your educational experience and assists the decision about the third-level supports you need. 
  * **Section C** is [ Evidence of Disability ](http://accesscollege.ie/dare/providing-evidence-of-your-disability/) which must be completed by the [ accepted medical consultant or specialist ](http://accesscollege.ie/dare/providing-evidence-of-your-disability/) for your particular disability. It provides verification of your disability and helps the decision about the third-level supports that you need. Sections B and C can only be sent to the CAO in paper form. The CAO advises all students to get a certificate of posting when sending documents by post. 

**Supports for students with disabilities**

If you have indicated on your CAO form that you have a disability or specific
learning difficulty, the college's [ Disability Service
](http://www.ahead.ie/yourdisabilityoffice) will be informed as soon as you
accept a place, and they will get in touch with you to work out what supports
they can provide.

Even if you didn't tick this box on the CAO form, you can still access the
available supports by contacting the college's Disability Service at any stage
during your time in college.

**Key dates for 2024 applications using DARE**

**6 November 2023** \- the [ online CAO application facility
](https://www.cao.ie/apply.php) for 2024 opens.

**1 February 2024** \- your main application must reach the CAO by 5 p.m. Late
CAO applications are not considered for DARE.

**1 March 2024** \- the following items must reach the CAO by 5 p.m.

  * Indicate that you wish to be considered for DARE by ticking 'Yes' on question 1. 
  * Complete Section A of the Supplementary Information Form. 

**15 March 2024** , the rest of the Supplementary Information Form must reach
the CAO by 5 p.m. These are:

  * Section B (the Educational Impact Statement) 
  * Section C (evidence of a disability) 

**No applications will be accepted after these closing dates** . The closing
dates are very strict because DARE is an additional application procedure
which needs extra processing time.

You should be notified by post by the end of **June 2024** (after the Leaving
Certificate exam) telling you whether you are eligible for the DARE scheme. If
you are told you are not eligible you can ask for your application to be
reviewed. If you are not eligible for DARE, you can still get into college if
you meet the entry requirements for your chosen course.

The CAO helpline at (091) 509 800 can help you with your DARE application. You
can find further information in this list of [ frequently asked questions
](http://accesscollege.ie/dare/help/) on the [ Access College website
](http://accesscollege.ie/dare/) . You can also contact the [ access services
of the colleges participating in the DARE scheme
](http://www.ahead.ie/yourdisabilityoffice) .

The DARE programme runs nationwide [ information sessions
](http://accesscollege.ie/dare/events/) for students and their
parents/guardians to deal with queries about preparing the application.

You can download a detailed [ Application Handbook and checklists
](https://accesscollege.ie/dare/making-an-application/handbooks-forms/) to
help with your application.

You can also access information about DARE on [ Facebook
](http://www.facebook.com/accesscollege) .
