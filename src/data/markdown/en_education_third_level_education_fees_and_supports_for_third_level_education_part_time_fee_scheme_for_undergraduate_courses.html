##  What is the part-time fee scheme?

The part-time fee scheme is a new financial support scheme for students
studying certain part-time undergraduate courses in Ireland and abroad.

The scheme provides fee support to eligible part-time students doing [
specified undergraduate courses ](https://www.susi.ie/eligibility-
criteria/approved-courses/undergraduate-students-approved-institutions---part-
time-courses/) leading to a major award with a minimum average of 30 credits
and maximum of 50 credits per academic year. The number of credits undertaken
during the academic year will determine the funding available to you for that
year (see ‘How much will I get?’ below).

The scheme is available to students currently studying on an approved course,
or students starting an approved course for the first time in the 2024/2025
academic year.

The scheme only offers support with fees and is not a maintenance grant.

Student Universal Support Ireland (SUSI) is the awarding authority for the
scheme.

If you are planning to study full-time, read about the [ Student Grant Scheme
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/education/third-level-education/fees-
and-supports-for-third-level-education/student-grant-scheme/) .

##  Who qualifies for the part-time fee scheme?

To qualify for the part-time fee scheme, you must meet the below conditions:

  1. Nationality condition 
  2. Residence condition 
  3. Means test 
  4. Approved course of study 
  5. Progression in education 
  6. Maximum period of grant assistance 

We cover each of these conditions below.

###  **1\. Nationality condition**

To get a student grant you must be a citizen of:

  * Ireland 
  * UK 
  * An EU or EEA country 
  * Switzerland 

If you are not a citizen of one of these countries, you may still qualify for
a grant if you have refugee status, or have an [ immigration status or leave
to remain permission accepted by SUSI ](https://www.susi.ie/eligibility-
criteria/nationality-criteria/) .

###  **2\. Residence condition**

You must have been resident in the State for 3 of the previous 5 years to
qualify for a part-time fee grant.

###  **3\. Means test**

The part-time fee scheme is means-tested and a student’s total reckonable
household income must fall below specific income thresholds.

The means test for 2024-2025 is based on your and your family's gross income
for the previous full tax year (2023).

SUSI looks at all ’reckonable income’ when assessing your student grant
application. Reckonable income is gross income from all sources. Some social
welfare payments and financial support payments are excluded.

For the part-time fee scheme, up to €7,925 of your earnings during the
previous calendar year can be deducted from your reckonable income.

Your [ applicant class ](https://www.susi.ie/eligibility-
criteria/income/applicant-class/) determines whose income is included in the
income calculation for grant assessment purposes. There are 3 types of
applicant class:

  * [ Dependent student ](https://www.susi.ie/eligibility-criteria/income/applicant-class/dependent-students/)
  * [ Mature dependent student ](https://www.susi.ie/eligibility-criteria/income/applicant-class/dependent-students/#d.en.11691:~:text=Will%20Appointed\)%20Guardians-,Mature%20Dependent%20Student,-If%20you%20were)
  * [ Independent student ](https://www.susi.ie/eligibility-criteria/income/applicant-class/independent-students/)

Read more about [ reckonable income on the SUSI website
](https://www.susi.ie/eligibility-criteria/income/index.html) .

####  **Income limits for part-time fee scheme**

The maximum income limits for eligibility for the part-time fee scheme in
2024-2025 are set out below:

**Number of dependent children** |  **Reckonable income must be under**  
---|---  
Less than 4  |  €55,924   
4 to 7  |  €61,342   
8 or more  |  €66,501   
  
An income limit increase of €4,950 applies for each additional person
attending a full-time course.

###  **4\. Approved colleges and courses**

Only approved part-time undergraduate courses are eligible for the part-time
fee scheme. You can find a [ list of approved colleges and courses
](https://www.susi.ie/eligibility-criteria/approved-courses/undergraduate-
students-approved-institutions---part-time-courses/) for the 2024-2025
academic year on the SUSI website.

Part-time PLC and postgraduate courses are not covered by the scheme.

###  **5\. Progression in education**

You must be progressing in your education. This means that you must be
attending a course:

  * That will give you a higher level of qualification than you already have 
  * That is a higher level than any other course you attended before 
  * Where you will be progressing your studies and will not be repeating any part of a course (except in exceptional circumstances) 

Read more about [ previous education and progression
](https://www.susi.ie/eligibility-criteria/previous-education-and-
progression/) on the SUSI website.

###  **6\. Maximum period of grant assistance**

You do not qualify for the part-time scheme if you have already got a grant
for the [ maximum number of years allowed ](https://www.susi.ie/eligibility-
criteria/previous-education-and-progression/#d.en.15224) for the level of
study you are undertaking.

##  How much will I get?

You get a fee contribution based on the number of credits you take during the
academic year. SUSI pays the contribution directly to your college.

If your course costs more than the maximum amount you are eligible for, you
will pay the difference. If your course costs less than the maximum amount you
are eligible for, you do not receive the difference.

For example, if you are doing a course worth 16 credits which costs €3,000,
SUSI will pay your college €2,250 and you will pay the balance of €750 to your
college.

If you are doing a course worth 16 credits which costs €1,400, SUSI will pay
your college €1,400.

Less than 4  |  €0
