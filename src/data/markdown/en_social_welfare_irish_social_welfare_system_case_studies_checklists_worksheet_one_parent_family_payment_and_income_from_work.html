Payment and income from work

#  Worksheet: One-Parent Family Payment and income from work

  * Worksheet 

##  Worksheet

If you are getting [ a One-Parent Family Payment ](/en/social-
welfare/families-and-children/one-parent-family-payment/) (OPF), this
worksheet will help you to work out how taking up a job will affect your
weekly income.

###  Step 1: Find how income from work will affect your One-Parent Family
Payment  

**Find your** assessable income from work (see **Note 1 below** ) €_______

Assessable income is your gross income less PRSI, pension contributions and
trade union subscriptions.

####  Note 1

Take away €165 from your weekly earnings (if earnings are below €165, you will
keep your full OFP). Half of your weekly earnings above €165 is assessed as
income.

**New rate** of One-Parent Family Payment €_______

To find your new rate of OPF, check [ SW 19 Social Welfare Rates of Payment
](https://www.gov.ie/en/collection/1af6ca-rates-of-payment-sw19/) to find out
how much OPF is payable with your means.

###  Step 2: Find your new total gross weekly income

Your total weekly income is your new rate of One-Parent Family Payment and
your income from work before tax.

**New rate** of One-Parent Family Payment (see **Step 1** **above** ) €_______  
**Add** Gross weekly income from work €_______  
**Total** Gross weekly income €_______

###  Step 3: Find your new total net weekly income

Your total weekly income is your new rate of One-Parent Family Payment and
your income from work after tax.

From this calculation you will be able to find out if you are financially
better off.

Gross weekly income €_______  
**Less** Universal Social Charge - see Note 2 below €_______  
**Less** PRSI paid each week - see Note 3 below €_______  
**Less** income tax paid each week - see Note 4 below €_______  
**Total** net income €_______

  
**Remember, you may have to pay child-minding and travel costs out of your net
income**

####  Note 2

You will pay a [ Universal Social Charge (USC) ](/en/money-and-tax/tax/income-
tax/universal-social-charge/) on your gross income from work (if your overall
income is above €13,000). You do not pay USC on your OFP payment.

####  Note 3 **  
**

You pay [ PRSI ](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/social-
insurance-prsi/social-insurance/) on income from your work only, not on your
One-Parent Family Payment. If you earn less than €352 a week you do not pay
any PRSI. You only pay PRSI for the weeks you work.

**Note 4**

You pay [ income tax (PAYE) ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/money-and-
tax/tax/income-tax/how-your-tax-is-calculated/#354b71) on all your income:
that is your gross weekly income (see **Step 2** **above** ).

To calculate how much income tax you pay each week, multiply your gross weekly
income by 20% to get the gross amount of income tax payable each week.

Total gross income by 20% €_______  
**Less** Weekly Tax Credit (see below for calculation)

**Total** income tax paid each week €______

Note that in practice your OFP payment is coded in against your tax credits
and rate band by Revenue - this worksheet simply shows you how to work out how
income from work will affect your OFP.

The amount that you can earn before you start to pay the higher rate of tax
(40%) is known as your [ standard rate cut-off point
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/money-and-tax/tax/income-tax/how-your-
tax-is-calculated/#354b71) . You can see [ examples of how to calculate income
tax ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/money-and-tax/tax/income-tax/case-
study-calculating-your-income-tax-case-studies/) using these tax rates and the
standard rate cut-off point.

####  **Tax Credit for 2024**

Personal Tax Credit: €1,875  
**Add** [ Single Person Child Carer Tax Credit ](/en/money-and-tax/tax/income-
tax-credits-and-reliefs/single-person-child-carer-tax-credit/) (if eligible):
€1,750  
**Add** Employee Tax Credit: €1,875  
**Total Tax Credit:** €5,500

Divide by 52 to give weekly tax credit.

**Weekly Tax Credit:** €105.77

###  Extra benefits

####  Other tax free allowances

You may be able to claim [ Mortgage Interest Relief ](/en/money-and-
tax/tax/income-tax-credits-and-reliefs/housing-tax-credits-and-reliefs/) and [

tax/tax/income-tax-credits-and-reliefs/) .

cards/medical-card/) for 3 years from the date you take up employment – check
with your local Health Service Executive Area.

####  Rent Supplement

You can use our worksheet on [ Calculating Rent Supplement ](/en/social-
welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/case-studies-checklists/worksheet-for-
calculating-rent-supplement/) to see how your Rent Supplement will be affected
by income from work.

####  Working Family Payment (WFP)

You can claim WFP if you are working at least 19 hours per week, or 38 hours
per fortnight, and your income falls below the income threshold for your
family size.

[ Working Family Payment ](/en/social-welfare/families-and-children/working-
family-payment/) is not taxable and does not affect secondary benefits.
