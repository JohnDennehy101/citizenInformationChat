  * More information 

##  Introduction

The Stay and Spend Tax Credit Scheme allows you to claim a certain amount of
tax back on accommodation, food and non-alcoholic drink bought between 1
October 2020 and 30 April 2021. This spending is known as _qualifying
expenditure_ .

Under the scheme:

  * A transaction must be at least €25 
  * You can submit receipts up to a total of €625, or €1,250 for a jointly-assessed married couple 
  * The maximum tax credit you can get is €125, or up to €250 for a jointly-assessed married couple 

All claims must be made within 4 years from the end of the tax year in which
you made the qualifying expenditure. For money spent between 1 October 2020
and 31 December 2020, you must claim the tax credit by 31 December 2024.

To check if a business took part in the scheme, see [ Revenue’s list of
qualifying service providers ](https://www.ros.ie/stay-spend-web/rev/sas) .

##  Who is entitled to claim?

Any taxpayer who spends at least €25 in a single transaction on ‘qualifying
expenditure’ between 1 October 2020 and 30 April 2021 is eligible to claim the
Stay and Spend Tax Credit.

You do not need to have been on a ‘staycation’ to avail of the scheme. You can
claim for expenses you paid in your local area if they qualify.

##  What expenses qualify for the credit?

You can claim on the following expenses:

  * Accommodation 
  * Food and non-alcoholic drink 

The minimum spend per transaction is €25. You must have spent the money
between 1 October 2020 and 30 April 2021.

####  Accommodation

Qualifying accommodation is accommodation that is registered with Fáilte
Ireland, including:

  * Hotels, guest houses, B&Bs 
  * Self-catering 
  * Caravan parks, camping parks and holiday camps 

####  Food and non-alcoholic drink

Food and drinks served in a café, restaurant, hotel or pub can also qualify
for relief.

The following expenses **do not apply** :

  * Takeaway food 
  * Alcoholic drinks 
  * Drinks (either alcoholic or non-alcoholic) served without food 
  * Amounts below €25 

You can check that your accommodation or food and drink provider is
participating in the scheme using [ Revenue’s list of qualifying service
providers ](https://www.ros.ie/stay-spend-web/rev/sas) .

##  Rates

The Stay and Spend tax relief is given at the standard rate of 20% up to a
maximum refund of €125 per person, or €250 for a jointly-assessed married
couple.

The amount of qualifying expenses is capped at a total of €625 per person, or
€1,250 for a jointly-assessed married couple.

Where a bill is split between two or more people, you should only include the
share of the bill which you actually paid in your claim. If possible, where a
bill is split between two or more customers, service providers should give
each customer an individual receipt for the services they have paid for.

##  How can I make a claim?

You can only claim for Stay and Spend expenses if you have receipts to prove
your claim.

You do this in two stages:

  * Stage 1: Submit your receipts 
  * Stage 2: Make a claim online 

####  Stage 1: Submit your receipts

You can use the [ Revenue's receipts tracker
](https://www.revenue.ie/en/online-services/services/common/manage-your-
receipts-with-receipts-tracker.aspx) to store your receipt details online.

You can continue to add receipts until you reach the cap on expenditure of
€625, or €1,250 for a jointly-assessed married couple.

####  Stage 2: Make a claim online

If you pay tax through PAYE you can make your claim by submitting the Income
tax return (Form 12) for the 2020 period in [ myAccount
](https://www.ros.ie/myaccount-web/sign_in.html?execution=e2s1&lang=en) .

If you are self-employed you can make your claim by submitting the Form 11 for
the 2020 period in [ ROS ](https://www.ros.ie/) .

You should submit your receipts (as proof of expenditure) before you submit
your return – see **‘Stage 1’** above.

You can get a step by step guide on how to upload a receipt and submit a claim
in [ Revenue's manual on Stay and Spend Tax Credit (pdf)
](https://www.revenue.ie/en/tax-professionals/tdm/income-tax-capital-gains-
tax-corporation-tax/part-15/15-01-47.pdf) .

##  How will the relief be given?

The Stay and Spend Tax Credit will reduce the amount of income tax you have to
pay (known as your _income tax liability_ ). The credit is deducted after all
other allowances, deductions or reliefs have been given to you.

If the tax credit is higher than your income tax liability in the year of
assessment, any excess credit can be taken away from the USC you have to pay
in that same year.

The credit can be used to reduce your liability to income tax and USC in the
year of assessment to nil. In cases where the tax credit available is higher
than your combined liabilities to income tax and USC in the year of
assessment, you will be unable to fully use the credit due to you.
