##  What is the Carer's Support Grant?

The Carer’s Support Grant is paid to carers once a year by the Department of
Social Protection (DSP). It used to be called the Respite Care Grant.

You can use the grant in whatever way you like. You can use it to pay for
respite care, but you don't have to. Read our page about [ breaks and respite
care for carers ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/health/health-
services/health-services-for-people-with-disabilities/respite-care/) .

In June of each year (usually on the first Thursday of the month), the DSP
pays the grant automatically to carers getting:

  * [ Carer's Allowance ](/en/social-welfare/carers/carers-allowance/)
  * [ Carer's Benefit ](/en/social-welfare/carers/carers-benefit/)
  * [ Domiciliary Care Allowance ](/en/social-welfare/disability-and-illness/domiciliary-care-allowance/)

Only one Carer’s Support Grant can be paid for each person getting care.

The Carer’s Support Grant was paid on 6 June 2024.

##  Can I get the Carer's Support Grant?

The Carer’s Support Grant is paid automatically to people getting:

  * Carer’s Allowance (both full rate and half-rate) 
  * Carer’s Benefit 
  * Domiciliary Care Allowance. 

The Carer’s Support Grant is not a means-tested payment.

  * Caring for the person on a full-time basis

###  Caring for more than one person

If you are caring for more than one person, a grant is paid for _each_ person
you care for.

###  Caring for a baby or child in hospital

If your baby or child is in hospital or other institution to get medical
treatment, you may qualify for the Carer’s Support Grant. To get the grant,
your baby or child must qualify for [ Domiciliary Care Allowance
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/social-welfare-
payments/disability-and-illness/domiciliary-care-allowance/) .
