##  Introduction

Children and young people can be called to give evidence in cases at the [
District Court ](/en/justice/courts-system/district-court/) , the [ Circuit
Court ](/en/justice/courts-system/circuit-court/) and the [ Central Criminal
Court ](/en/justice/courts-system/high-court/) .

If you have been called to give evidence you may feel worried or anxious about
what the experience will be like. It may be helpful to understand the steps
involved in taking a case to court. The [ Courts Service
](https://www.courts.ie/) has published an [ information booklet (pdf)
](https://www.courts.ie/acc/alfresco/cda752dc-563f-44e6-9c50-75a051f3fcc6/Going
to Court Booklet - March 2012.pdf/pdf#view=fitH) and [ video
](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1NKZZLAnL8) for young witnesses about going
to court.

##  Being called to give evidence

###  The Gardaí

A complaint is made to the Gardaí that identifies the child or young person as
a victim of, or witness to, a crime. A Garda officer then interviews the child
or young person.

Witnesses who are under 18 years of age can make statements during an
interview with a Garda or another competent person. A competent person in this
situation could be a professional who assesses the young person because of an
abuse case that is being investigated.

The Gardaí consider the allegations and can decide to:

  * Interview the accused about what the child or young person has said and send the file to the Director of Public Prosecutions, or 
  * Arrest the accused on warrant, or 
  * Charge the accused with an offence or 
  * Issue a summons for the accused to appear in court. 

###  The Director of Public Prosecutions

The Gardaí inform the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP)
about the case. They also inform the DPP about how the child or young person
feels about giving evidence in court, and how their parents, guardians or
carers feel about this.

The DPP makes an independent decision about whether to proceed with the
prosecution, which means that the child or young person may or may not need to
give evidence.

###  The court

Criminal cases begin in the [ District Court ](/en/justice/courts-
system/district-court/) where the judge sits without a jury. Cases involving
minor offences are decided in the District Court. Cases involving more serious
offences are sent to the [ Circuit Court ](/en/justice/courts-system/circuit-
court/) . Cases involving murder, rape, aggravated sexual assault, treason and
piracy must be heard in the [ Central Criminal Court ](/en/justice/courts-
system/high-court/) . In the Circuit and Central Criminal Courts, there is a
judge and a jury.

If you are 14 years of age or older when you give evidence you will have to
take an oath or affirmation. This means that you promise to tell the truth by
repeating certain words. The clerk or register will tell you what you have to
say.

If you are under 14 years of age the judge may decide that you do not have to
take the oath. You must still tell the truth, and it will be an offence if you
do not do so.

In some cases involving sexual offences, the judge can decide not to let
members of the public into the court.

It is important that your evidence be in your own words. No one should tell
you what to say or help you practice giving your evidence before you go to
court. The case may fail if it appears that you have been "coached". The
prosecution can give you more advice on this.  

##  Giving evidence by video-link

In cases involving a sexual or violent offence, witnesses who are under 18
years of age may be allowed to give evidence by video-link, unless there is a
good reason why they should not. [ Section 13 of the Criminal Evidence Act
1992 ](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1992/en/act/pub/0012/sec0013.html) , as
amended, sets out the rules for how evidence can be given by video-link.

To do this you sit in a private room and give your evidence by live video-
link. Someone from the court will stay with you to give you any help you may
need. A television monitor in the court shows your image, and you have a
television monitor in your room, which show you what is happening in the
courtroom. This means that you do not have to go into the courtroom or see the
accused.

When you give evidence by live video-link, the judge and the barristers do not
wear wigs or gowns in court. The judge can decide to let an intermediary (for
example, a social worker) ask the questions. The questions should be asked in
a way that is appropriate for the age and mental ability of the witness.

##  Giving evidence from behind a screen

In certain circumstances, a physical screen or partition can be positioned in
the courtroom, so the witness can their give evidence in the court without
having to see the accused when doing so. This option is available at the
judge’s discretion if the witness is under 18 and the proceedings are about a
sexual or violent offence. This is done to protect the witness from secondary
or repeat victimisation.

##  Video recording of statements

In certain situations, a video recording of a witness statement can be
admitted as evidence. This is only allowed if the victim, or any other witness
giving evidence, is under 18 years old, and the accused is charged with a
sexual offence, child trafficking or child pornography.

In these cases a video recording of the child’s statement can be admitted so
they don’t have to give evidence in person in open court. [ Section 16 of the
Criminal Evidence Act 1992
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1992/en/act/pub/0012/sec0016.html) sets out
the rules for videotaping children’s statements.

There are a number of rules about videotaped statements and their
admissibility in court including:

  * The video recording must be relevant 
  * The child witness must be available to be cross-examined by the defence after the video is played at the trial (cross-examination may be by [ video link ](/en/justice/witnesses/remote-hearings-and-video-link-evidence/) and using an intermediary) 
  * The prosecution must serve notice that it plans to admit a videotaped interview in evidence and must give the accused a reasonable opportunity to view the videotape 
  * An edited version of the videotape may be played to the court, but this can only happen if the accused agrees to it and the judge allows it 

Ultimately, the judge decides whether a videotape can be admitted in evidence.
The judge considers whether admitting the videotape will be unfair to the
accused.
