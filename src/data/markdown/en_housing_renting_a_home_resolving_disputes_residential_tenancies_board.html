##  What is the Residential Tenancies Board?

The Residential Tenancies Board was set up under the [ Residential Tenancies
Act 2004 ](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2004/act/27/enacted/en/html) to
regulate the private rented sector.

It was initially called the Private Residential Tenancies Board (PRTB) but its
name was changed to the Residential Tenancies Board (RTB), when [ approved
housing bodies (AHBs) ](/en/housing/local-authority-and-social-
housing/approved-housing-bodies/) were brought under its remit in 2015 by the
[ Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2015
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2015/act/42/enacted/en/html) .

In 2019 [ student-specific accommodation ](https://www.rtb.ie/registration-
and-compliance/registrations/student-specific-accommodation) also came under
the remit of the RTB. This means that tenants in student-specific
accommodation have most of the same rights as private tenants. This change was
brought in under the [ Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2019
](https://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2019/act/14/enacted/en/html) .

The RTB's main functions are to:

  * Maintain a register of private residential tenancies, tenancies of approved housing bodies and student-specific accommodation tenancies 
  * Provide a dispute resolution service for tenants and landlords 
  * Carry out research into the private rented sector 
  * Provide policy advice to the Government on the private rented sector 

##  Residential tenancies legislation

The Residential Tenancies Acts deal with the regulation of the mainstream
private rented housing sector, the approved housing body sector and student-
specific accommodation. The Acts set out the rights and obligations of both [
landlords ](/en/housing/renting-a-home/landlords-rights-and-
responsibilities/landlords-rights-and-obligations/) and [ tenants
](/en/housing/renting-a-home/tenants-rights-and-responsibilities/tenants-
rights-and-obligations/) in these sectors. They do not apply to certain types
of rented property.

###  Types of rented property that are exempt from residential tenancies
legislation

The Residential Tenancies Acts **do not apply** to the following types of
rented property:

  * Business lettings 
  * Holiday lettings 
  * Formerly rent-controlled properties or long occupation lease tenancies (separate legislation applies to them) 
  * [ A **room** that you rent in your landlord's home ](/en/housing/renting-a-home/tenants-rights-and-responsibilities/sharing-accommodation-with-your-landlord/)
  * A property where the landlord's spouse, parent or child lives. This applies to informal family arrangements where there is no tenancy agreement in writing. However, the Act does cover formal agreements between family members, for example where a lease has been signed 
  * [ Local authority housing ](/en/housing/local-authority-and-social-housing/)

**Part 4 of the 2004 Act** (which deals with [ security of tenure
](/en/housing/renting-a-home/tenants-rights-and-responsibilities/types-of-
tenancy/) ) does not apply to:

  * Employment-related lettings â€“ these are sometimes called 'tied' houses in that they are tied to the job and you must leave the property when the job ends, and 
  * Student-specific accommodation 
  * Transitional properties let by approved housing bodies 

Also, if you are renting a flat or apartment that was originally part of the
landlord's main house, your landlord can choose to opt out of the Part 4
provisions on security of tenure. Read more in our page on [ Sharing
accommodation with your landlord ](/en/housing/renting-a-home/tenants-rights-
and-responsibilities/sharing-accommodation-with-your-landlord/) .  

##  What does the RTB do?

###  Registration of tenancies

The RTB maintains a [ national register of tenancies
](https://www.rtb.ie/check/index.html) . All private residential tenancies,
approved housing body tenancies and student-specific accommodation tenancies
must be registered with the RTB. Since 4 April 2022, landlords must [ register
their tenancies ](/en/housing/renting-a-home/landlords-rights-and-
responsibilities/registering-a-tenancy/) every year, within a month of the
date of when the tenancy began. Landlords who do not register their tenancies
can be fined up to â‚¬4,000 and may be imprisoned if convicted.

Read more in our page on [ registering a tenancy ](/en/housing/renting-a-
home/landlords-rights-and-responsibilities/registering-a-tenancy/) and on the
[ RTBâ€™s website ](https://www.rtb.ie/annual-registration) .

The RTB can share information with local authorities, which enforce the
regulations relating to [ standards ](/en/housing/renting-a-home/tenants-
rights-and-responsibilities/minimum-standards-for-rented-homes/) and [ rent
books ](/en/housing/renting-a-home/tenants-rights-and-responsibilities/rent-
books/) . It can also share information with the [ Department of Social
Protection ](http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/home.aspx) and the [ Revenue
Commissioners ](https://www.revenue.ie/en/Home.aspx) .

###  Dispute resolution

The RTB provides a confidential dispute resolution service. You can start the
dispute resolution process if you are a tenant, a landlord or are otherwise
directly affected by a problem (for example, if you are a neighbour). A
landlord who has not registered the tenancy with the RTB cannot use the
dispute resolution service, but their tenant can use it.

Read more in our document on [ resolving disputes ](/en/housing/renting-a-
home/resolving-disputes/disputes-between-landlords-and-tenants/) and on the [
RTBâ€™s website ](https://www.rtb.ie/dispute-resolution) .

###  Investigation and sanction of landlords

The RTB has an [ investigations and sanctions unit
](https://www.rtb.ie/registration-and-compliance/investigations-sanctions) ,
which has the power to:

  * Investigate landlords who have broken residential tenancies legislation, for example, if they donâ€™t register their tenancies or comply with Rent Pressure Zones rules 
  * Caution or sanction landlords with a fine of up to â‚¬15,000 if they do not meet their obligations as a landlord 

The RTB uses these powers to monitor and enforce the legislation, particularly
in relation to Rent Pressure Zones and termination of tenancy notices. These
additional powers were brought in under the [ Residential Tenancies
(Amendment) Act 2019
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2019/act/14/enacted/en/html) .

###  Research and information

The RTB has published a number of [ research reports
](https://www.rtb.ie/about-rtb/news/the-rtb-publish-findings-from-their-
rental-sector-survey-2020-reports) on issues in the private rented sector and
it also publishes a quarterly Rent Index. It provides a wide range of
information for tenants, landlords and agents, along with [ sample forms
](https://www.rtb.ie/forms-documents) and other publications, such as the [
Good Landlord/Tenant Guide (pdf)
](https://www.rtb.ie/images/uploads/Comms%20and%20Research/RTB_A_Guide_to_Being_A_Good_Tenant_-
_Landlord__V7_2021_Final.pdf) .

##  How much does it cost to register a tenancy or submit a dispute?

###  Registration fees

The basic fee for registering a private rented, student-specific or cost
rental tenancy with the RTB is â‚¬40 per year. The fee to register an AHB
tenancy is â‚¬20 a year. These rates only apply if the RTB receives the
completed application within a month of the start of the tenancy. Late fees
apply if an application is received more than a month late. There are
exemptions from annual registration fees for certain tenancies. Find more
information in our page on [ registering a tenancy ](/en/housing/renting-a-
home/landlords-rights-and-responsibilities/registering-a-tenancy/) .

###  Dispute resolution

The RTB deals with [ disputes between landlords and tenants
](/en/housing/renting-a-home/resolving-disputes/disputes-between-landlords-
and-tenants/) . There are 2 stages to the RTBâ€™s dispute resolution process.
Stage 1 is confidential mediation or adjudication. Mediation means that an
impartial mediator helps the parties come to an agreement together, while
adjudication is where an adjudicator makes a decision on the case. Stage 2 is
an appeal of the mediatorâ€™s or adjudicatorâ€™s decision, which is a public
hearing by a 3-person Tenancy Tribunal.

Fees for submitting an application to the RTB for dispute resolution are:

**Type of dispute resolution** |  **Cost**  
---|---  
**Dispute resolution by mediation** |  No charge   
**Dispute resolution by adjudication** |  â‚¬30   
**Appealling the outcome of mediation** |  â‚¬30   
**Appealing an adjudicatorâ€™s decision** **  
** |  â‚¬85

##  Where to make a complaint about the RTB

If you are unhappy with the service provided by the RTB you can contact them
to make a formal complaint. You should:

  * Make the complaint as soon as possible after the issue has happened 
  * Provide as much information as possible 

Your complaint will be reviewed by someone in the RTB who was not involved in
the original issue. The RTB aim to deal with complaints within 14 days. If
this is not possible they will contact you to let you know it will take
longer. The [ RTBâ€™s Customer Charter ](https://www.rtb.ie/about-
rtb/governance/customer-charter) has more information about their complaints
procedure.

The RTBâ€™s complaints procedure does not cover all types of complaints about
the RTB. For example, there is a different process for complaints or appeals
about RTB Adjudication or Tribunal Determinations. The [ RTBâ€™s Customer
Charter ](https://www.rtb.ie/about-rtb/governance/customer-charter) has more
information on this.
