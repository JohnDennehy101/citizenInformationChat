##  Medical cards

Office ](http://www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/1/LHO/) can help you find a

The [ medical card ](/en/health/medical-cards-and-gp-visit-cards/medical-

under the Medical Card Scheme include:

  * [ General Practitioner ](/en/health/health-services/gp-and-hospital-services/gp-services-to-medical-card-holders/) (local doctor) services 
  * Hospital [ in-patient and out-patient services ](/en/health/health-services/gp-and-hospital-services/hospital-services-introduction/) (as a public patient)

##  Free health services

Some health services are free of charge even if you donâ€™t have a medical card.

For example, all [ maternity services ](/en/health/health-
services/reproductive_health/maternity-and-infant-welfare-services/) and [
immunisation services ](/en/health/health-services/children-s-
health/vaccinations-for-children/) are free. Your [ local health centre
](http://www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/2/healthcentres/) or Local Health Office
will advise you about getting access to these services in your area.

A Local Health Office may have waiting lists for these services and may have
to give priority on the basis of medical need.

If you are pregnant or have small children, your GP may refer you to the local
[ Public Health Nurse ](/en/health/health-services/care-in-your-
community/public-health-nurses/) or you can contact the service directly
yourself through your [ local health centre
](http://www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/2/healthcentres/) or [ Local Health
Office ](http://www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/1/LHO/) .

##  Medical screening

A free medical screening service is available to all asylum seekers.

This service is confidential and independent of your application for
international protection (refugee status or subsidiary protection).

The service includes screening for infectious diseases like TB, Hepatitis B,
Hepatitis C and HIV and checking the vaccination needs of you and your family.

Follow-up medical treatment, if you need it, will be provided for you and your
family for free under the medical card scheme.
