##  Introduction

If you are moving back to Ireland and unsure about what work opportunities you
want to explore, construction is a rapidly growing industry worth considering.
Similarly, if you are coming back to Ireland with a background in construction
and want to continue working in this sector, there are a range of
opportunities.

The sections below cover several topics that will help you if you are a
returning construction worker or thinking about construction as a profession
when you are back.

##  Careers in construction

Construction is a growing industry in Ireland and covers a range of roles,
including:

  * Design 
  * Engineering 
  * Skilled trades (like being a plumber or electrician) 
  * General labourers 
  * Building Information Modelling (BIM) specialist 
  * Construction management 
  * Environmental health and safety 
  * Quantity surveying 
  * Building services engineer 

The [ Construction Industry Federation ](http://www.cif.ie/) (CIF), is the
national organisation in Ireland that represents construction industry
employers (also called ‘contractors’). You can [ learn more about the kinds of
careers available in construction on their website
](https://cif.ie/careersinconstruction/) .

###  **Apprenticeships**

If you are interested in a construction job, but don’t have training yet, you
can do an apprenticeship in an area that interests you. An apprenticeship
involves learning on-the-job while having an employment contract and getting
paid a salary. There is also off-the-job training in an education centre.

You can [ learn more about apprenticeships by reading our page
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/education/further-education-and-
training/apprenticeships/) .

[ Read additional information provided by the CIF

##  Safepass

You will need to complete safety awareness training and get a [ Safe Pass
registration card
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/employment/employment-rights-and-
conditions/health-and-safety/safe-pass/) before you can work on construction
sites. This includes apprentices, trainees, and on-site security workers.

SOLAS is the organisation in Ireland that manages Safe Pass. They have a
database you can use to [ search for an Approved Training Organisation (ATO)
](https://www.constructioncourses.ie/Home/PublishedCourses) that provides the
Safe Pass training near you.

###  **Recognition of equivalent safety training**

The Construction Skills Register (CSR) one day health and safety course in
Northern Ireland is the only course recognised by SOLAS as an equivalent to
the Safe Pass course. If you have a CSR Health and Safety card, you can
contact [ rpq@solas.ie ](mailto:rpq@solas.ie) about getting your CSR skills
recognised.

[ Read more on our page about Safepass
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/employment/employment-rights-and-
conditions/health-and-safety/safe-pass/) .

##  Certification schemes

Certification schemes provide training and assessments that certify you have
the knowledge and skills needed to work in the construction sector.

###  **Construction skills certification scheme (CSCS)**

You must complete Construction Skills Certification Scheme (CSCS) training if
you are carrying out tasks where safety is critical. You also need a Safepass
card to enroll.

SOLAS-approved organisations deliver the training programmes. They are divided
into [ eight categories, with each category requiring a different CSCS
Registration Card ](https://www.solas.ie/construction-lp/course-
information/#cscs) .

SOLAS has a database you can use to [ search for Approved Training
Organisations (ATO)
](https://www.constructioncourses.ie/Home/PublishedCourses) that provide the
CSCS-required training for whichever tasks you are carrying out in your
construction work. The ATO will charge you a fee for participating in a CSCS
programme.

When you successfully complete the programme, you will receive a CSCS
Registration Card. CSCS Registration Cards are issued for 5 years. After that,
you will need to [ renew your card online
](https://cardrenewals.solas.ie/#/cscs/renew) .

###  **Quarries Skills Certification Scheme (QSCS)**

The Quarries Skills Certification Scheme (QSCS) programmes are for non-craft
operatives in the quarrying sector and are divided into [ three categories,
and each requires a different QSCS registration card
](https://www.solas.ie/construction-lp/course-information/#qscs) . You do not
need a Safe Pass card to enroll.

You can use the SOLAS database to [ search for Approved Training Organisations
(ATO) ](https://www.constructioncourses.ie/Home/PublishedCourses) that provide
the QSCS-required training for activities you will do in your job. The ATO
will charge you a fee for participating in a CSCS programme.

QSCS Experienced Operator Registration Cards are issued for 5 years. After
that, you can [ renew your card online.
](https://cardrenewals.solas.ie/#/qscs/renew)

###  **What if I have qualifications, but they are from outside the European
Union?**

You can apply to have your qualifications from outside the European Union
recognised in Ireland. To do this, you need:

  * A detailed CV (including references from previous employers confirming your work experience) 
  * A copy of your valid operator’s card or licence 
  * Any associated certifications you have 

You can email these documents to SOLAS for review at [ rpq@solas.ie

##  Trade unions

[ Trade unions ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/employment/employment-
rights-and-conditions/industrial-relations-and-trade-unions/trade-unions/)
represent and protect the rights and interests of their members. There are
several trade unions in the Irish construction industry, and you have a
constitutional right to join one. All of these unions must have a [
negotiating licence ](https://dbei.gov.ie/en/Publications/Guidelines-and-
Application-Form-for-Trade-Union-Negotiation-Licence.html) to negotiate
employee wages and other conditions of employment.

The [ Irish Congress of Trade Unions (ICTU) ](http://www.ictu.ie/) is the
umbrella organisation for trade unions, representing a range of interests of
ICTU members, both in Ireland and Northern Ireland. ICTU has information if
you want to [ join a union ](https://ictu.ie/join-union) .

##  Wages and pensions

###  **Your wages**

There are rules (called a [ ‘Sectoral Employment Order’ (SEO)
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/employment/employment-rights-and-
conditions/industrial-relations-and-trade-unions/employment-agreements-and-
orders/#578fa2) ) that set minimum pay rates for certain workersin the
construction sector, including apprentices.

The SEO for the construction sector also sets out other conditions like sick
pay and pension entitlements. In addition, it defines the experience and
qualifications that place you in a particular employment category.

You can [ read more about the SEO for the construction sector
](https://www.workplacerelations.ie/en/what_you_should_know/hours-and-
wages/sectoral%20employment%20orders/construction-sector/) on the Workplace
Relations Commission (WRC) website.

###  **Pensions in construction**

If you work in construction, there are pension schemes available. [ The
Construction Workers' Pension Scheme (CWPS)
](https://www.cwps.ie/content/AboutUs/2) , for example, is one of the largest.

An [ Auto-enrolment pension savings scheme
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-
system/auto-enrolment/) is expected to be introduced in 2025. Your employer
may enroll you in this scheme if they don’t have another one in place.

You can watch the Department of Social Protection’s [ video on auto-enrolment
](https://youtu.be/2_f2_8AP2l8) or visit [ the auto-enrolment information hub
](https://www.gov.ie/en/campaigns/0ab04-automatic-enrolment-for-pensions-hub/)
.
