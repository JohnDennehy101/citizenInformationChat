#  Deposit Return Scheme

  * What is the Deposit Return Scheme? 
  * What containers can be recycled? 
  * How much does the deposit cost? 
  * Where can I return my containers? 
  * What happens if I buy a drink in a restaurant or café? 
  * More information on the Deposit Return Scheme 

##  What is the Deposit Return Scheme?

When you buy a drink in a container with the [ Re-turn logo ](https://re-
turn.ie) , you are charged a small refundable deposit. You can then claim back
the levy by returning the empty container.

This bottle and can recycling system is known as the Deposit Return Scheme.
The scheme began on 1 February 2024.

The cost of the deposit is automatically added to the cost of the drink.

You can get your deposit by returning your containers as long as they are
empty and undamaged.

##  What containers can be recycled?

Most drinks containers such as bottles, cans and tins made from plastic,
aluminium or steel can be returned once they are between 150ml and 3 litres in
size and have the Re-turn logo on them.

The containers should be empty, undamaged and in their original shape. The
container should have a [ Re-turn logo ](https://re-turn.ie) and the barcode
must also be readable.

###  **What containers are not included in the recycling scheme?**

Some containers are not included in the scheme and can’t be returned,
including:

  * Glass bottles or containers 
  * All dairy containers (for example, milk or yogurt containers) 
  * Containers over 3 litres 

You can not return drinks containers that were bought before 1 February 2024
as they do not have the Re-turn logo or barcode.

Since 1 June 2024, all containers included in the scheme should have a Re-turn
logo.

If your container doesn't have a Re-turn logo on it, you can't return it and
it should be recycled as normal.

###  **Should I leave the bottle cap on when returning my bottle?**

You should leave the bottle cap on your bottle when you return it. This will
ensure that:

  * The bottle cap is properly recycled 
  * The bottle holds its shape, making it easier for the machine to read the barcode 

Since 3 July 2024, all plastic drink containers of up to 3 litre in size must
have their caps attached to them. This helps make sure that bottle caps are
properly recycled with bottles. This rule was introduced as part of the [ EU’s
Directive on single-use plastics ](https://eur-
lex.europa.eu/eli/dir/2019/904/oj) . The European Commission has more
information on their [ plans to tackle single-use plastics
](https://environment.ec.europa.eu/topics/plastics/single-use-plastics_en) .

##  How much does the deposit cost?

The deposit costs between 15-25 cent depending on the size of the container.

  * Containers between 150ml to 500ml have a 15 cent deposit 
  * Containers over 500ml to 3 litres have a 25 cent deposit 

##  Where can I return my containers?

You can return your containers to shops that sell drink containers with the
Re-turn logo. You don't need to return your containers to the same shop that
you bought them from.

At the shops you can either return the containers:

  * Using a Reverse Vending Machine (RVM) 
  * Manually in the shop 

Not all shops have a Reverse Vending Machine.

If a shop does not have a RVM but they sell containers with the Re-turn logo,
the shop may allow you to manually return containers in store, unless they
have a take back exemption, see below.

[ Re-turn.ie ](https://re-turn.ie/) has an interactive map, which shows you
all the locations where you can return your containers. You can also search by
entering an address or Eircode.

Find the [ map and other information about where to return your containers on
the Re-turn website ](https://re-turn.ie/#WhereToReturn) .

####  **Take back exemptions**

Certain businesses can get a take back exemption, which means they don't have
to take back containers for the Deposit Return Scheme. For example, retail
outlets with less than 250 square metres of customer-facing space can apply
for an exemption. Re-turn have more information about [ take back exemptions
(pdf) ](https://re-turn.ie/wp-content/uploads/Take-Back-Exemptions.pdf) and
what shops can apply for them.

###  **How do I collect my deposit?**

If you are using a Reverse Vending Machine, you will be given a voucher for
the value of the deposit on the number of containers you returned. You can
choose to use your voucher to buy something in that specific shop or to refund
your voucher for cash.

If you return your containers using an RVM, you can only use or get a refund
for your voucher in the same shop where you returned the bottles. You cannot
reclaim your voucher in a shop if you used a RVM in a different shop.

##  What happens if I buy a drink in a restaurant or café?

Some restaurants and cafés may charge you a deposit fee if you buy a drink
that comes in a container.

Generally, sit-down restaurants and other businesses that focus on on-site
consumption will not charge you a deposit fee. This is because they can
collect and return the drink containers themselves.

Take-aways and other businesses that focus on off-site consumption, will
generally charge you a deposit fee. This is because you will usually take the
container away with you.

turn website ](https://re-turn.ie/) .
