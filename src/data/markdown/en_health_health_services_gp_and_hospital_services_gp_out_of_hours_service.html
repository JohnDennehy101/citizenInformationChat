##  Introduction

In Ireland, your local family doctor is called a [ GP (general practitioner
](/en/health/health-services/gp-and-hospital-services/) ). A GP is usually the
first doctor that you will see about non-emergency illnesses and health
issues.

###  **Opening hours in Ireland for family doctors (GPs)**

Most GPs work Monday to Friday but their opening hours can vary. A GP that
works in an out-of-hours works during the night and on weekends.

**If your medical issue is not urgent** , you should make an appointment to
see your usual GP during their clinic hours.

**If your medical issue is urgent** and you need to see a GP outside their
clinic hours, you can contact your local GP out-of-hours service. This service
does not provide routine clinic appointments.

##  How does the GP out-of-hours service work?

You must make an appointment to use the GP out-of-hours service. There is no
drop-in facility.

The out-of-hours service is available at night and on weekends.

If you phone your GP outside normal working hours, you will usually get a
recorded message with the contact details for your local GP out-of-hours
service. The Health Service Executive (HSE) website also provides [ a list of
phone numbers for the out-of-hours service.
](https://www2.hse.ie/services/find-a-gp-out-of-hours/#Oout%20of%20hours)

When you ring the GP out-of-hours service, you will first speak to a nurse
about your (or your childâ€™s) symptoms. The nurse will clinically assess
whether you need:

  * Nursing advice over the phone 
  * An appointment with a GP 
  * A house call 
  * A referral to the Emergency Department (A & E) 
  * Or an ambulance 

If the nurse decides that you need to see the out-of-hours doctor (GP), they
will give you an appointment.

##  How much does GP out-of-hours service cost?

Your appointment with the out-of-hours GP is free if you have a [ medical card
](http://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/health/medical-cards-and-gp-visit-
cards/medical-card/) or a [ GP visit card ](/en/health/medical-cards-and-gp-
visit-cards/gp-visit-cards/) . You must bring your card with you otherwise you
will be charged for the appointment.

If you do not have a medical card or GP visit card, you will be charged as a
private patient. Contact your [ local GP out-of-hours service
](https://www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/3/outofhours/gpooh.html#Oout%20of%20hours)
to find out how much you will have to pay for a consultation.

##  Contact your GP out-of-hours service

You can find contact details for your local service on the [ HSE list of GP
out-of-hours services
](https://www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/3/outofhours/gpooh.html#Oout%20of%20hours)
.
