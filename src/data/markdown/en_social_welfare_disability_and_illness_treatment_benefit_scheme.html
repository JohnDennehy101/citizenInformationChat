##  What is Treatment Benefit?

Treatment Benefit is a scheme run by the Department of Social Protection (DSP)
to provide a limited financial contribution towards dental, optical and aural
services.

The Treatment Benefit Scheme is available to insured workers, the self-
employed and retired people who have the required number of [ PRSI
contributions ](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/social-
insurance-prsi/social-insurance/) .

Under the Treatment Benefit Scheme, you may qualify for:

  * Dental benefit 
  * Optical benefit 
  * Hearing aids 
  * Hair piece or wig 

You should contact your treatment provider to check your eligibility before
proceeding with any treatment.

###  Treatment Benefit in the EU

If you choose to have treatment in another EU member state, the DSP will pay
an amount equivalent to the rate paid for similar treatments carried out in
Ireland or the amount actually paid for the treatment - whichever is the
lower. You must still have the qualifying PRSI contributions.

Contact the Treatment Benefit Section (see 'Contact details' below) before you
travel to get an application form and details of the amounts the DSP will pay.

##  Dental Benefit

###  Under this scheme, the DSP pays the full cost of an oral examination once
a calendar year.

A payment of €42 towards either a scale and polish or - if clinically
necessary - periodontal treatment, is also available once a calendar year. If
the cost of either cleaning or periodontal treatment is more than €42, you
must pay the balance - capped at €15 for a scale and polish. There is no cap
on the balance charged for periodontal treatment.

Treatment is provided by private dentists who are on the DSP's panel. [ Lists
of dentists on the panel are available from the DSP
](http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/dentists.aspx) . Most dentists are on the
panel, so you should not have any difficulty finding one. The dentist will be
able to check your eligibility and make a claim for you. The claim form will
require details such as your [ Personal Public Service Number (PPS number)
](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/personal-public-service-
number/) , date of birth and signature. If you are a dependent spouse or civil
partner, you should give the PPS number of the insured person, who will also
be required to sign the claim form.

###  Tax relief

You may get [ tax relief on certain non-routine dental treatments ](/en/money-
and-tax/tax/income-tax-credits-and-reliefs/taxation-and-medical-expenses/) .

##  Optical Benefit

The Treatment Benefit Scheme entitles you to a free eyesight test, once every
2 years. However, sight tests for VDUs and [ driving licences ](/en/travel-
and-recreation/motoring/driver-licensing/full-driving-licence/) are not
covered under the scheme.

You can get a [ set payment
](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/600f9e-treatment-benefit-fees-payable/) ,
once every 2 years, towards either one pair each of reading and distance
spectacles, one pair of bifocal or varifocals **or** one pair of contact
lenses (including disposables). Cost will vary depending on the frames you
choose. Basic frames are free.

The examination is provided by [ opticians
](http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/Opticians-list-page-for-the-website-of-the-
Department-of-Soc.aspx) , [ optometrists or ophthalmologists
](http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/Ophthalmologists-list-page-for-the-website-
of-the-Department.aspx) who have a contract with the DSP.

##  Medical lenses

If you need contact lenses for medical reasons, you can get up to €1,000
towards the cost of a pair of medical contact lenses (€500 for each contact
lens) once every 2 years. This applies to a small number of eye conditions
that make wearing glasses impossible. You must have a doctor's recommendation.
Contact lenses are not available on purely cosmetic grounds. Contact lenses
for optical purposes are available through the Optical Benefit scheme above.

##  Hearing aids

Hearing aids may be provided by [ suppliers who have a contract with the DSP
](http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/Medical-Appliance-Suppliers.aspx) . The DSP
pays the full cost of a hearing aid up to a maximum of €500 (€1,000 for a
pair) once every 4 years. It also pays the full cost of repairs to aids, up to
a maximum of €100, once every 4 years.

##  Hairpiece and wig

From 28 May 2022, you can get up to €500 for one hair replacement item such as
a hairpiece or wig, in each calendar year. It does not cover surgical or
topical treatments.

Hair loss must be from a disease or treatment of a disease such as cancer or
alopecia. The types of alopecia covered are:

  * Alopecia areata (which includes alopecia totalis or universalis, diffuse alopecia areata, alopecia ophiasis) 
  * Primary scarring alopecias (cicatricial alopecias) 
  * Frontal fibrosing alopecia and lichen planopilaris (scarring alopecia) 
  * Chemotherapy induced alopecia (anagen effluvium) 
  * Alopecia resulting from surgery or trauma, including burns 

You must buy the hair piece or wig from the [ Department's list of approved
providers ](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/09786-list-of-hair-replacement-
product-suppliers-by-county/) .

##  How to qualify for Treatment Benefit

###  Contribution conditions

You must have paid Class A, E, H, P or S social insurance contributions.

The amount of social insurance you need depends on your age.

( **1) Aged under 21**

If you are aged under 21, you may qualify if you have paid at least 39
contributions at any time.

**(2) Aged 21-28**

Between these ages you may qualify if you have paid at least 39 contributions
_and_

  * At least 39 paid or credited in the governing contribution year (2021is the governing contribution year for claims made in 2023) **or**
  * 26 paid contributions in each of the second and third last contribution years. For claims made in 2023, the second last contribution year is 2021 and the third last contribution year is 2020. 

**(3) Aged 29-65**

From the age of 29 onwards, you must have at least 260 paid contributions
_and_

  * At least 39 paid or credited contributions in the governing contribution year (2021 is the governing contribution year for claims made in 2023) **or**
  * 26 paid contributions in each of the second and third last contribution years. For claims made in 2023, the second last contribution year is 2021 and the third last contribution year is 2020. 

**(4) Aged 66 and over**

There are special rules for people aged 66 and over. To qualify, you must
have:

  * 260 PRSI contributions paid at any time and 39 paid or credited contributions in the relevant tax year or the year immediately before it. The relevant tax year is the second last completed tax year before reaching 66 years of age. (For example, if you were 66 in 2015, the relevant tax year is 2013.) 

**Or**

  * 260 PRSI contributions paid at any time and 26 paid contributions in both the relevant tax year and the year immediately before it. The relevant tax year is the second last completed tax year before reaching 66 years of age. (For example, if you were 66 in 2015, the relevant tax year is 2013.) 

There are, however, a number of exceptions to the above:

If you reached 66 between 1 October 1987 and 6 July 1992, you need 208 paid
contributions.

If you are getting a [ State pension ](/en/social-welfare/older-and-retired-
people/) the PRSI contribution requirements vary according to age as follows:

**If you were:** |  **You must have at least:**  
---|---  
Aged 66 between 1 October 1987 and 6 July 1992  |  208 weeks PRSI paid since first starting work and 39 weeks paid or credited in the relevant tax year* or the year immediately before it.  Or  208 weeks PRSI paid since first starting work and 26 contributions paid in both the relevant tax year* and the year immediately before it.   
Aged 66 on or after 6 July 1992  |  260 weeks PRSI paid since first starting work and either 39 weeks paid or credited in relevant tax year* or the year immediately before it.  Or  260 weeks PRSI paid since first starting work and 26 contributions paid in both the relevant tax year* and the year immediately before it.   
  
*The relevant tax year is the second last completed tax year before reaching 66 years of age. (For example, if you were 66 in 2015, the relevant tax year is 2013.) 

If you satisfy these conditions when you reach pension age, you will remain
qualified for life.

###  Qualified at 60 and over

If you qualify for benefit at age 60–65, you retain that entitlement for life.
If you have retired on grounds of ill health or you are considered to be
unemployed, you can apply for Illness Benefit or Jobseeker's Benefit, subject
to satisfying the statutory conditions. Your entitlement to these benefits may
also lead to your being awarded credited contributions, which can be taken
into account to extend coverage for treatment benefits for further periods.

###  Spouse, civil partner or cohabitant

A spouse, civil partner or cohabitant may, of course, qualify in their own
right if they have enough social insurance contributions.

If your spouse, civil partner or cohabitant does not have enough social
insurance contributions they may still qualify for Treatment Benefit on your
social insurance record. To do this, you must qualify for Treatment Benefit
and your spouse, civil partner or cohabitant must be dependent on you.

A dependent spouse, civil partner or cohabitant must:

  * Have a gross income of €100 or less per week. If earning more than €100 per week, he/she must have been dependent on you before entering or resuming insurable employment (at Class A, E, H, P or S). 
  * **Not** be getting a social welfare payment (except Disablement Pension, Supplementary Welfare Allowance, Carer's Benefit or Child Benefit). If getting Carer's Allowance or State Pension (Non-Contributory), he/she can qualify if he/she was dependent on you immediately before getting the Allowance or Pension. 

If an insured person dies and the dependent spouse or civil partner was
entitled to benefit at the time of the death, they retain entitlement for as
long as they remain widowed or a surviving civil partner.

###  EU regulations and Treatment Benefit

If you were previously insurably employed in a country covered by EU
Regulations and you do not qualify on your Irish PRSI record, your social
insurance record in the other EU country may be used to help you qualify for
Treatment Benefit. You must have paid at least one reckonable PRSI
contribution (Classes A, E, H, P and S) since your return to Ireland.

##  How to apply for Treatment Benefit

Claims are made through your provider (dentist, dispensing
optician/optometrist/ophthalmologist or audiologist), who can check your
entitlement in advance of treatment and claim payment afterwards.

Your provider will require some information to identify you, such as your date
of birth and [ PPS number ](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-
system/personal-public-service-number/) . Prior to treatment, you will need to
sign a Consent Form agreeing to your provider having this information and
giving your consent to have this information supplied to the Department of
Social Protection, to enable payment of your claim.

If you are claiming as a dependant under the PRSI record of your spouse, civil
partner or cohabitant, both you and your spouse or partner will need to sign
the Consent Form.

For treatment received in other EU member states, you contact the Treatment
Benefit Section at the address below to confirm your eligibility. If eligible,
you send your receipts to the Treatment Benefit Section along with a letter
containing your contact information and details of your bank account (account
name, number and sort code) into which payment will be made.
