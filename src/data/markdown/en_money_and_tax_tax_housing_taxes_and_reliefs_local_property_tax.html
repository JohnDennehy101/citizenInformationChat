##  Introduction

An annual Local Property Tax (LPT) is charged on residential properties in
Ireland.

You are liable for LPT in 2024 if you own a residential property on 1 November
2023.

**If you paid LPT for 2023**

If you paid LPT for 2023 with a repeating payment method, such as a direct
debit, the payment will continue in 2024 unless you choose a different way to
pay. Repeating methods include LPT deductions from your salary, pension or
social protection payment. If you have changed bank, you may need to [ update
your direct debit ](https://www.revenue.ie/en/property/local-property-
tax/paying-your-lpt/changing-bank-details.aspx) .

If you paid LPT for 2023 with a type of payment that does not automatically
repeat, you need to choose how you want to pay LPT for 2024. You can do this
in your [ Revenue property record ](https://www.revenue.ie/en/property/local-
property-tax/lpt-liability/your-revenue-property-record.aspx) .

You should have confirmed your payment method with Revenue by:

  * 1 December 2023, if you choose to spread the payments over the year 
  * 10 January 2024, if you choose to pay in a single payment 

**If you did not pay 2023 LPT**

If your property was not liable for LPT on 1 November 2022 but is liable on 1
November 2023, you should [ submit an LPT return
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/money-and-tax/tax/housing-taxes-and-
reliefs/local-property-tax/#5a2b43) by 1 December 2023. Even if you own a [
property that is exempt ](/en/money-and-tax/tax/housing-taxes-and-
reliefs/local-property-tax-exemptions/) , you must still make a Local Property
Tax return to claim an exemption.

If you were liable for 2023 LPT but did not submit an LPT return you should do
so now.

You may be able to [ defer payment of the LPT ](/en/money-and-tax/tax/housing-
taxes-and-reliefs/deferring-local-property-tax/) in certain circumstances.

##  Who must pay Local Property Tax?

If you own residential property on 1 November, including rental property, you
must pay LPT. This date is called the _liability date_ .

If there is more than one owner, you need to agree on who will pay the tax,
otherwise, Revenue can collect it from any of the owners.

In some cases, you must pay the LPT if you are not the owner:

  * If you are a tenant with a long-term lease of more than 20 years or 
  * If you have a right to live in the property for life or for more than 20 years or a right to live there ‘to the exclusion of all others’ 

If a property is rented on a normal short-term lease (less than 20 years), the
landlord pays the LPT.

##  How much is the Local Property Tax?

The tax you pay is based on the market value of the property on the valuation
date. The valuation date for LPT is **1 November 2021** . The value of your
property on that date will be used to calculate your LPT for the years 2022 to
2025.

The LPT is a self-assessment tax, so you calculate the tax due based on your
own assessment of the market value of the property. Read about [ how to value
your property for Local Property Tax ](/en/money-and-tax/tax/housing-taxes-
and-reliefs/valuing-property-for-lpt/) .

There are different rates of LPT depending on which range, or valuation band,
your property value is in.

**Local Property Tax** **Valuation bands and basic rates for valuation period
2022–2025**  
---  
**Valuation band number** |  **Valuation band €** |  **LPT Charge basic rate €**  
1  |  0 – 200,000  |  90   
2  |  200,001 – 262,500  |  225   
3  |  262,501 – 350,000  |  315   
4  |  350,001 – 437,500  |  405   
5  |  437,501 – 525,000  |  495   
6  |  525,001 – 612,500  |  585   
7  |  612,501 – 700,000  |  675   
8  |  700,001 – 787,500  |  765   
9  |  787,501 – 875,000  |  855   
10  |  875,001 – 962,500  |  945   
11  |  962,501 – 1,050,000  |  1,035   
12  |  1,050,001 – 1,137,500  |  1,189   
13  |  1,137,501 – 1,225,000  |  1,408   
14  |  1,225,001 – 1,312,500  |  1,627   
15  |  1,312,501 – 1,400,000  |  1,846   
16  |  1,400,001 – 1,487,500  |  2,064   
17  |  1,487,501 – 1,575,000  |  2,283   
18  |  1,575,001 – 1,662,500  |  2,502   
19  |  1,662,501 – 1,750,000  |  2,721   
For properties worth more than €1.75 million, see below.  
  
In 2022, the valuation bands were widened, and the tax rate was lowered. For
previous rates, see 'More information' below.

**Properties worth more than €1.75 million**

Properties worth more than €1.75 million are assessed on the actual value of
the property rather than from a valuation band.

The LPT charge for these properties is **the total of** :

  * **0.1029% of the first €1.05 million** of market value of the property 
  * **0.25%** of the portion between **€1.05 million and €1.75 million**
  * **0.3%** of the portion **above €1.75 million**

###  The local adjustment factor

Local authorities can vary the basic LPT rate on residential properties in
their area. These rates can be increased or decreased by up to 15%. This is
known as the local adjustment factor.

Residential properties of the same value in different local authority areas
may pay different amounts of LPT, depending on whether the local authority has
applied a local adjustment factor or not.

There is [ a list of local authority LPT adjustments
](https://www.revenue.ie/en/property/local-property-tax/valuing-your-
property/determining-lpt-charge.aspx) on revenue.ie. Revenue also has an [
online LPT calculator ](https://lpt.revenue.ie/lpt-web/reckoner/lpt.html) that
calculates the tax after the local adjustment factor.

##  Do I have to submit a Local Property Tax return?

**If you submitted an LPT return for 2023** for your property, you **do not**
need to make another return for 2024. You may need to arrange to [ pay the LPT
](/en/money-and-tax/tax/housing-taxes-and-reliefs/paying-local-property-tax/)
for 2024.

For the years 2022 to 2025, the LPT is based on the value of your property on
**1 November 2021** . This is called the valuation date.

**You do need to submit an LPT return for 2024 if you have a property that has
become liable** since the valuation date and you have not submitted a return
for it. For example, you may have a property that has been built or become
residential after 1 November 2022 and so is a liable property on 1 November
2023. If you have a property that is newly built or renovated, you should [
assess the value it would have had on 1 November 2021
](https://www.revenue.ie/en/property/local-property-tax/valuing-your-
property/newly-liable-properties.aspx) if it had been completed then.

You must [ assess the market value of your property ](/en/money-and-
tax/tax/housing-taxes-and-reliefs/valuing-property-for-lpt/) and **submit your
LPT return by 1 December 2023** .

You are required to submit your LPT return even if:

  * Your property is eligible for [ an LPT exemption ](https://www.revenue.ie/en/property/local-property-tax/lpt-exemptions/index.aspx) or 
  * You are claiming a [ deferral of LPT payment ](https://revenue.ie/en/property/local-property-tax/deferral-of-payment/index.aspx)

##  How to submit a Local Property Tax return

If your property has never been registered for stamp duty or LPT, you first
need to [ register the property with Revenue
](https://www.revenue.ie/en/online-services/services/property/register-
property-lpt.aspx) .

To view your LPT record and make your LPT return online, you can use your
existing login details for [ myAccount ](https://www.ros.ie/myaccount-
web/home.html) or [ Revenue Online Service (ROS)
](http://www.revenue.ie/en/online/ros/index.html) . Alternatively, you can log
in directly to the [ LPT online service ](https://lpt.revenue.ie/lpt-
web/views/login.html?execution=e1s1) .

To log in to the LPT online service, you will need your Property ID and PIN
which you can find on any LPT correspondence you have received from Revenue.
You will also need your Personal Public Service Number (PPSN) or Tax Reference
Number.

If you do not have your Property ID and PIN, you can use the [ LPT online
service ](https://lpt.revenue.ie/lpt-web/views/login.html?execution=e1s1) to
request them.

Revenue has a [ short video that explains how to submit your LPT return online
](https://www.revenue.ie/en/property/local-property-tax/submitting-your-local-
property-tax-return/submitting-lpt-return-online.aspx) .

You can contact the [ LPT helpline ](https://www.revenue.ie/en/contact-
us/customer-service-contact/lpt-vht.aspx) for help with the Local Property
Tax. You can also send queries to Revenue through [ MyEnquiries
](https://www.revenue.ie/en/online-services/services/manage-your-
record/myenquiries.aspx) .

###  Appeals

In general, because LPT is a self-assessed tax, formal appeals only arise in a
small number of situations.

If you do not agree with a Revenue estimate you can replace it by submitting a
return with your own self-assessment.

Since Revenue has compiled a register of residential properties from various
sources, there may be errors about ownership of some properties. If you got a
LPT return form and you do not think you are liable for that property you
should [ contact Revenue ](https://www.revenue.ie/en/contact-us/customer-
service-contact/lpt-vht.aspx) within 30 days of getting the letter. You should
include an explanation of why you are not liable, the details who you think is
the liable person (name, address, and PPS Number) and supporting
documentation. It is important that you contact Revenue because if the error
is not corrected you are liable to pay the tax. Revenue will use the
information you supply to make a decision on whether you are a liable person.
If you do not agree you can appeal this decision to the [ Tax Appeal
Commission. ](https://www.taxappeals.ie/)

Appeals relating to the valuation of properties are decided by the Land Values
Reference Committee.

If you disagree with Revenue on other matters (for example, whether the
property is residential or whether you can defer payment) and the matter
cannot be resolved, Revenue will issue a formal Notice of Assessment or a
formal decision on the matter to you. Your right to appeal to the Appeal
Commissioners will be set out clearly on the notices. However, you must make a
return and pay any tax due before you can appeal the Notice of Assessment or
any other Revenue decision.

###  The Household Charge and Non-Principal Private Residence Charge

The Local Property Tax replaced the [ Household Charge
](https://www.householdcharge.ie) which was abolished from 1 January 2013. [
Household Charge arrears ](https://www.revenue.ie/en/online-
services/services/property/payment-household-charge-arrears.aspx) that were
not paid by 1 July 2013 were converted into LPT and are now collected by
Revenue through the LPT system.

The [ Non-Principal Private Residence (NPPR) charge ](https://www.nppr.ie/) on
second homes was introduced in 2009 and paid to the relevant local authority.
From 2014 onwards, the NPPR is no longer charged, but outstanding liabilities
and payments will still be collected. If you are selling your house and need
to prove that you have paid the NPPR, you can request a certificate of
discharge from the [ Local Authority ](https://www.gov.ie/en/organisation-
information/fd139-local-government-councils-and-
councillors/?referrer=http://www.housing.gov.ie/local-
government/administration/local-authorities/local-authorities) .

After 12 years the charges expire and so are no longer due to be paid. If
there was an NPPR charge on a property for 2009, it expired on 1 August 2021.
Charges for the years 2010–2013 expire on 1 April. An NPPR charge for 2010,
for example, expired on 1 April 2022 and the charge for 2013 will expire on 1
April 2025. For more information, see [ nppr.ie ](https://www.nppr.ie/) .
