#  Leaving Ireland and your social security entitlements

  * What is social security? 
  * Countries covered by EU Regulations 
  * How to get your Irish social insurance record 

##  What is social security?

A country’s social security system can provide you with a benefit or payment,
for example, if you are sick, unemployed, have children or retire.

Every year, Irish citizens leave Ireland to work, travel, study or retire
abroad. Many others who have been living, studying or working in Ireland also
leave to return to their home countries.

If you leave Ireland to live or work in another country, you may be able to
use your Irish social insurance contributions to qualify for social security
benefits in the country you are moving to. You can find more information about
the [ social security arrangements that Ireland has with other countries.
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-
system/claiming-a-social-welfare-payment/social-insurance-contributions-from-
abroad/)

Some Irish social welfare payments can also be paid abroad – find out more
about [ going abroad and social welfare payments.

payments/)

###  **UK and social security benefits**

[ The Convention on Social Security between Ireland and the United Kingdom
(UK) (pdf)
](https://opac.oireachtas.ie/Data/Library3/Documents%20Laid/2021/pdf/DSPdocslaid130121a_130121_101924.pdf)
was signed by both countries on 1 February 2019. Under the terms of the
Convention, pre-existing arrangements with regard to recognition of, and
access to, social insurance entitlements will be maintained in both
jurisdictions. This means that the rights of Irish citizens living in Ireland
to benefit from social insurance contributions made when working in the UK
will be protected and vice versa.

##  Countries covered by EU Regulations

If you move to live or work in a country covered by EU Regulations, you are
entitled to be treated in the same way as the nationals in that EU/EEA member
state for social security benefits or services. This means that you and your
family are entitled to apply for any benefits or assistance available in that
country.

If you are applying for insurance-based payments, social insurance
contributions made in other EU/EEA member states can be taken into account.

###  **Social insurance record**

If you need to [ claim a social security benefit while living abroad
](https://www.gov.ie/en/service/cf633a-claiming-benefits-abroad/) , you will
be asked to provide information about your Irish social insurance record.

Forms U1 and E104 are needed when claiming sickness, maternity or unemployment
benefits abroad.

The U1 is called a _portable document_ and it provides details of your [ Irish
social insurance record ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-
welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/social-insurance-prsi/social-insurance-in-
ireland/) . If you don’t bring your U1 with you, the country you have moved to
will contact Irish authorities to get a record of your insurance contributions
when you apply to them.

Requests for an E104 form (used for health related benefits) can only be made
by the authority in the relevant EU member state.

A request from another EU/EEA member state for your social insurance record
will be prioritised by the Department of Social Protection (DSP) so that you
don’t lose out on any benefits due to you when abroad.

##  How to get your Irish social insurance record

If you want to bring your U1 with you, you can [ request your Irish social
insurance record for U1 (pdf)
](https://assets.gov.ie/69370/10649c2dcdb84da4a44721dcd917aeb2.pdf) before
leaving. Processing your application can take some time as the DSP may have to
contact your recent employers before U1 forms can be issued.

You should send your completed application form to the [ International Records
Section ](https://www.gov.ie/en/service/cf633a-claiming-benefits-abroad/) of
the Department of Social Protection.
