#####  Site updates

From 1 January 2024, [ Statutory Sick Pay (SSP) ](/en/employment/employment-
rights-and-conditions/leave-and-holidays/sick-leave-and-sick-pay/) will
increase from 3 to 5 days a year. You cannot get [ Illness Benefit
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/social-welfare-
payments/disability-and-illness/disability-benefit/) on the days that you get
SSP. If your first illness in 2024 is less than 5 days and you qualify for
Statutory Sick Pay, you don't need to apply for Illness Benefit. For illnesses
lasting more than 5 days, Illness Benefit starts from day 6. If you use your 5
days of SSP in 2024 and you become ill again in the same year, you'll get
Illness Benefit from day 4 of your illness, which is after the normal 3
waiting days.

you can do this online for a fee of €55.

From April 2024, the [ Hot School Meals Programme
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/education/primary-and-post-primary-
education/going-to-primary-school/giving-children-an-even-break-by-tackling-

Since 6 December 2023, companies that [ provide mortgage protection insurance
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/housing/owning-a-home/buying-a-
