##  Returning to Ireland and COVID-19

Since 6 March 2022, all COVID-19 [ travel restrictions
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/travel-and-recreation/travel-to-
ireland/travel-to-ireland-during-covid/) were removed for travellers to
Ireland. You do not need to complete a passenger locator form. You do not need
proof of vaccination or recovery, or a COVID-19 test. Visit [ ireland.ie
](https://www.ireland.ie/en/dfa/overseas-travel/advice/) for up-to-date travel
advice.

When you arrive in Ireland, you do not have to wear a face covering on public
transport. You may be asked to [ wear a face covering in healthcare settings
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/health/covid19/face-coverings-during-
covid19/) .

Visit the [ HSE website for the latest information on COVID-19
](https://www2.hse.ie/conditions/coronavirus/coronavirus.html) , including:

##  Returning to Ireland from Ukraine

Irish citizens in Ukraine can call the Department of Foreign Affairs on +353 1
408 2000 for emergency consular assistance.

Find information and updates on Ukraine and neighbouring countries on [ the
ireland.ie website ](https://www.ireland.ie/en/dfa/overseas-travel/advice/) .

Read our page ‘ [ Coming to Ireland from Ukraine
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/moving-country/asylum-seekers-and-
refugees/the-asylum-process-in-ireland/coming-to-ireland-from-ukraine/) ’ for
information for Ukrainian refugees coming to Ireland, or who have already
arrived in Ireland.

##  Emergency accommodation

You should try to arrange somewhere to stay before you return to Ireland. If
this is not possible, read the information below.

###  **Returning with nowhere to stay on arrival**

If you are [ homeless ](/en/returning-to-ireland/finding-somewhere-to-
live/guide-to-housing-supports-for-returning-irish-emigrants/) when you return
to Ireland, you should contact the [ local authority
](https://www.housing.gov.ie/local-government/administration/local-
authorities/local-authorities) in the area that you have a [ local connection
](/en/returning-to-ireland/finding-somewhere-to-live/guide-to-housing-
supports-for-returning-irish-emigrants#l80745) to apply for emergency [
accommodation assistance ](/en/housing/losing-your-home/agencies-for-homeless-
people#l3e1b6) . As part of the assessment, you must [ apply for social
housing ](/en/housing/local-authority-and-social-housing/applying-for-local-
authority-housing/) .

In **Dublin city** , you can call [ Dublin City Council’s Central Placement
Service ](https://www.homelessdublin.ie/homeless/help/dublin-city-council)
homeless freephone on 1800 707 707 (2pm to 2am Monday to Friday and 10am to
2am weekends and Bank Holidays). Visit [ homelessdublin.ie
](https://www.homelessdublin.ie/) for more information.

There are also day service supports available in urban parts of Ireland such
as Dublin and Cork from [ agencies providing services for homeless people
](/en/housing/losing-your-home-and-homelessness/agencies-for-homeless-people/)
. Many of these services provide showers, lockers and mental health supports.

###  **Homeless abroad**

If you are homeless abroad, you should contact the nearest [ Irish embassy or
consulate ](https://www.ireland.ie/en/dfa/embassies/) for local supports.
Depending on what country you’re in, there may be [ Irish support
organisations ](https://www.migrantproject.ie/leaving-ireland/settling-in/)
that can help you.

##  Social welfare assistance

To apply for a social welfare payment without an Irish address, you will need
to show that you are engaging with your local authority for emergency
accommodation assistance. You will need a [ PPS number ](/en/returning-to-
ireland/applying-for-social-welfare/pps-numbers-for-returning-irish-emigrants-
and-families/) .

If you are **homeless in Dublin** , you should contact the [ Homeless Persons
Unit ](https://www.homelessdublin.ie/homeless/advice) on 1800 724 724 to apply
for a social welfare payment.

If you are homeless and **outside Dublin** , you should [ contact the local
authority ](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/942f74-local-authorities/) for
details of where to apply for a social welfare payment.

Applying for a social welfare payment can take time and you must meet certain
conditions to qualify. You may need to show that Ireland is your main place of
residence as part of the ‘ [ habitual residence condition
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/returning-to-ireland/applying-for-
social-welfare/habitual-residence-condition/) ’, and satisfy a [ means test
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-
system/means-test-for-social-welfare-payments/means-test/) .

Read more about [ accessing the Irish social welfare system as a returning
Irish emigrant ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/returning-to-
ireland/applying-for-social-welfare/accessing-social-welfare-as-a-returning-
Irish-emigrant/) .

##  Emergency medical needs

If you need emergency medical help, go to the accident and emergency
department in the nearest hospital, or call 999 or 112 free of charge. Read
more about [ emergency health services
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/health/health-system/emergency-health-
services-in-ireland/) in Ireland.

You can [ access the public healthcare system as a returning Irish emigrant
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/returning-to-ireland/looking-after-
your-health/accessing-healthcare-on-your-return-to-ireland/) if you:

  * have been living in Ireland for at least a year, or 
  * plan to live here for at least one year 

If you meet either of these conditions, you are considered ‘ [ ordinarily
resident’ in Ireland ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/health/health-
system/entitlement-to-public-health-services#l2b820) .

##  Returning to Ireland after release from prison or being deported

Contact the [ Irish Council for Prisoners Overseas (ICPO)
](https://www.icpo.ie/) before you are released and return to Ireland. The
ICPO is a charitable organisation that supports Irish prisoners in prisons
overseas and when they return.

If you are in a prison overseas and want to apply to transfer to a prison in
Ireland, read the ICPO’s information on [ repatriation
](https://www.icpo.ie/repatriation/) .

You can download the ICPO’s [ step-by-step guide on returning to Ireland after
being released from prison (pdf) ](https://www.migrantproject.ie/wp-
content/uploads/2019/10/Crosscare-ICPO-Returning-to-Ireland-
leaflet-10.2019.pdf) . You can also download a copy of their ‘ [ Resettlement
handbook (pdf) ](https://www.icpo.ie/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/ICPO-
Resettlement-Handbook-Final.pdf) ’.

###  **Deportation**

If you are being deported to Ireland, you can get [ consular assistance
](https://www.ireland.ie/en/dfa/overseas-travel/assistance-
abroad/deportation/) from the [ local Irish embassy or consulate
](https://www.ireland.ie/en/dfa/embassies/) .

Make sure to ask for a copy of your deportation papers before your return. You
may need these when applying for social welfare payments and other services.
You will also need photo ID, ideally a passport.

If the Irish embassy or consulate gives you an emergency travel document, make
sure to request a copy of it, as passport control will keep your travel
document when you arrive in Ireland.

##  Contact your local Irish embassy

If you’re in a crisis abroad, you should contact the local [ Irish embassy or
consulate ](https://www.ireland.ie/en/dfa/embassies/) for [ consular support
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/moving-country/moving-abroad/leaving-
ireland/diplomatic-supports/) .

You can choose to [ register your contact details
](https://www.ireland.ie/en/dfa/overseas-travel/citizens-registration/) with
the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA). If necessary and possible, they will
contact you during an unexpected crisis, such as a natural disaster or period
of civil unrest.

You can also contact the DFA’s [ Consular Assistance Unit
](https://www.ireland.ie/en/dfa/overseas-travel/assistance-abroad/) in Dublin
by calling +353 1 408 2527 during office hours, or using [ their online
contact form ](https://www.dfa.ie/about-us/contact-us/contact-consular-
assistance/) . You can also call +353 1 408 2000 for out-of-hours emergencies.
