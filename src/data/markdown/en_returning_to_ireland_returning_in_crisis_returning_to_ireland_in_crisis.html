](/en/returning-to-ireland/finding-somewhere-to-live/guide-to-housing-

##  Social welfare assistance

To apply for a social welfare payment without an Irish address, you will need
to show that you are engaging with your local authority for emergency
accommodation assistance. You will need a [ PPS number ](/en/returning-to-
ireland/applying-for-social-welfare/pps-numbers-for-returning-irish-emigrants-
and-families/) .

Unit ](https://www.homelessdublin.ie/homeless/advice) on 1800 724 724 to apply

If you are homeless and **outside Dublin** , you should [ contact the local
authority ](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/942f74-local-authorities/) for
details of where to apply for a social welfare payment.

Applying for a social welfare payment can take time and you must meet certain
conditions to qualify. You may need to show that Ireland is your main place of
residence as part of the ‘ [ habitual residence condition
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/returning-to-ireland/applying-for-
social-welfare/habitual-residence-condition/) ’, and satisfy a [ means test

Irish emigrant ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/returning-to-
ireland/applying-for-social-welfare/accessing-social-welfare-as-a-returning-
Irish-emigrant/) .

##  Emergency medical needs

If you need emergency medical help, go to the accident and emergency
department in the nearest hospital, or call 999 or 112 free of charge. Read
more about [ emergency health services
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/health/health-system/emergency-health-
services-in-ireland/) in Ireland.

You can [ access the public healthcare system as a returning Irish emigrant
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/returning-to-ireland/looking-after-
your-health/accessing-healthcare-on-your-return-to-ireland/) if you:

  * have been living in Ireland for at least a year, or 
  * plan to live here for at least one year 

If you meet either of these conditions, you are considered ‘ [ ordinarily
resident’ in Ireland ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/health/health-
system/entitlement-to-public-health-services#l2b820) .

##  Returning to Ireland after release from prison or being deported

Contact the [ Irish Council for Prisoners Overseas (ICPO)
](https://www.icpo.ie/) before you are released and return to Ireland. The
ICPO is a charitable organisation that supports Irish prisoners in prisons
overseas and when they return.

If you are in a prison overseas and want to apply to transfer to a prison in
Ireland, read the ICPO’s information on [ repatriation
](https://www.icpo.ie/repatriation/) .

You can download the ICPO’s [ step-by-step guide on returning to Ireland after
being released from prison (pdf) ](https://www.migrantproject.ie/wp-
content/uploads/2019/10/Crosscare-ICPO-Returning-to-Ireland-
leaflet-10.2019.pdf) . You can also download a copy of their ‘ [ Resettlement
handbook (pdf) ](https://www.icpo.ie/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/ICPO-

###  **Deportation**

If you are being deported to Ireland, you can get [ consular assistance
](https://www.ireland.ie/en/dfa/overseas-travel/assistance-
abroad/deportation/) from the [ local Irish embassy or consulate
](https://www.ireland.ie/en/dfa/embassies/) .

Make sure to ask for a copy of your deportation papers before your return. You
may need these when applying for social welfare payments and other services.
You will also need photo ID, ideally a passport.

If the Irish embassy or consulate gives you an emergency travel document, make
sure to request a copy of it, as passport control will keep your travel
document when you arrive in Ireland.
