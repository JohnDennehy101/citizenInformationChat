##  Switching jobs

When you switch jobs there are important things you should be aware of
relating to your tax, social insurance contributions (PRSI) and pension (if
you have one).

##  Tax information

###  Leaving your job

When you leave your job, your employer will enter your leaving date and
details about your final pay and deductions into Revenue’s online system.

You can then see your pay and income tax details for your old job through the
[ ‘Manage your tax’ link in myAccount ](https://www.revenue.ie/en/online-
services/services/manage-your-record/manage-your-tax-for-the-current-year-
paye-customers.aspx) .

You won’t receive a P45 from your employer when you leave.

###  Starting your new job

When you start your new job, your new employer will inform Revenue of your
start date. This creates a new employment record for you and lets your new
employer access updated tax credits and tax rate bands for you.

Revenue will send a Revenue payroll notification (RPN) to your new employer.
The RPN will tell your employer how much income tax and universal Social
Charge (USC) to deduct from your pay.

If you are starting your first job in Ireland, you must register it in the
jobs and pensions section of Revenue’s online service myAccount.

You can find more information about how to do this in our page about [ online
services for PAYE taxpayers ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/money-and-
tax/tax/income-tax/online-services-for-paye-taxpayers/) .

##  How to avoid emergency tax

You may be taxed temporarily called _emergency tax_ if you are changing jobs
if your new employer does not get your RPN.

###  You gave your employer your PPS number

You get a tax cut-off point for the first month, based on the single-person
tax cut-off point for the year.

Your income is taxed at the standard rate (20%) until week 4 and at the higher
rate (40%) from week 5 on.

###  You didn’t give your employer your PPS number

You are taxed at the higher rate (40%) with no tax credits until you give your
employer your PPS number.

You can check Revenue’s [ current emergency tax and USC rates (pdf)
](https://www.revenue.ie/en/jobs-and-pensions/documents/emergency-rates.pdf) .

To avoid emergency tax you should:

  1. Give your employer your PPSN 
  2. Register for [ Pay As You Earn (PAYE) in myAccount ](https://www.ros.ie/myaccount-web/home.html)

##  Social insurance (PRSI)

Most employers and employees (between the ages of 16 and 66) pay social
insurance (PRSI) contributions to the National Social Insurance Fund. PRSI
helps pay for social welfare benefits and pensions.

You must give your new employer your [ Personal Public Service number (PPS
number) ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/irish-social-
welfare-system/personal-public-service-number/) . This will make sure your
combined social welfare contributions are recorded and protect your
entitlement to benefits and pensions in the future. You can find more
information about [ social insurance (PRSI)
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-
system/social-insurance-prsi/social-insurance/) .

##  Changing jobs and your pension

You only need to register your first job or private pension with the [ Jobs
and Pensions section of Revenue’s myAccount
](https://www.revenue.ie/en/online-services/services/paye-services/add-job-
pension.aspx) .

If you change job, you no longer need to register your new job or pension –
see more below.

###  **Occupational pensions**

If you have an [ occupational pension
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/money-and-tax/personal-
finance/pensions/occupational-pensions/) you can either keep your benefits
within the scheme (known as a _preserved benefit_ ) or transfer the benefits
to another scheme.

A preserved benefit means that you get a pension when you reach the scheme's
normal retirement age.

When you leave your pension scheme, you must get a Leaving Service Options
letter within 2 months, outlining your benefit options.

####  **Can I get a refund of pension contributions?**

If you have less than 2 years' contributions, you can get a refund of your own
contributions. This refund will be taxed, because you got tax relief when you
made the contribution.

Before leaving your job, talk to the person responsible for administering the
pension scheme, as each scheme has its own rules.

####  **Personal Retirement Savings Accounts (PRSA)**

If you have a [ PRSA ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/money-and-
tax/personal-finance/pensions/personal-retirement-savings-accounts/) you can
stop or start it without charges by contacting your PRSA provider. PRSA’s are
flexible investment accounts allowing you to change job while keeping the same
PRSA.

For more details see the [ Pension Authority’s booklet, PRSAs – a consumer and
employer's guide (pdf).
](https://www.pensionsauthority.ie/en/prsa_providers/prsas/prsas%20-%20a%20consumer%20and%20employer's%20guide.pdf)

##  Register your new job

You only need to register your first job or private pension with the [ Jobs
and Pensions section of Revenue’s myAccount
](https://www.revenue.ie/en/online-services/services/paye-services/add-job-
pension.aspx) .

If you change job, you no longer need to register your new job or pension.

All you need to do is give your employer your PPSN. Your employer is
responsible for registering second and subsequent jobs. Your employer can
register your job by either requesting a Revenue Payroll Notification (RPN) or
by making a payroll submission.

When Revenue gets this information they will send a Tax Credit Certificate
(TCC) to you and your new employer or pension provider. This ensures the
correct amount of tax is deducted from your job or private pension.
