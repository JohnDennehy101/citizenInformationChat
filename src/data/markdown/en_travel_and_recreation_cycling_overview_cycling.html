#  Cycling in Ireland

  * Introduction 
  * Bicycles and public transport 
  * Bike sharing schemes 
  * Greenway trails 
  * Getting started as a cyclist in Ireland 

##  Introduction

Cycling is a popular and environmentally friendly way to get around in
Ireland. If you cycle to work, you can get tax relief under the [ Cycle to
Work Scheme ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/travel-and-
recreation/cycling/cycle-to-work-scheme/) to buy a new bike and equipment.

There are separate cycle paths in towns and cities, popular recreational
routes and a growing network of rural greenways.

You can [ find some excellent cycling routes in Ireland
](https://www.cyclingireland.ie/get-involved/find-a-route/) .

This page gives an overview of cycling in Ireland.

You can find out about:

  * Taking a bike on public transport 
  * Bike sharing schemes 
  * Greenway routes 
  * Getting started 

##  Bicycles and public transport

Plan your trip using the [ journey planner
](https://www.journeyplanner.transportforireland.ie/departures?language=en)
from Transport for Ireland.

Get public transport information from [ Irish Rail
](http://www.irishrail.ie/travel-information/bicycle-information) and [ Bus
Eireann ](http://www.buseireann.ie/inner.php?id=376) .

###  **Can I bring a bike on public transport?**

In many cases, you can bring bicycles on public transport in Ireland.

You can bring a bike on any Irish Rail train for free, although there are some
restrictions during busy periods (such as sporting fixtures and concerts).

See the table below for more information.

**Public transport** |  **Rules for bringing your bicycle**  
---|---  
Train - InterCity  |  You must [ book bicycle spaces for Intercity services online before you travel ](https://www.irishrail.ie/en-ie/travel-information/bicycle-information-for-rail-travel#bicyclesonintercitytrains) .   
Train – DART and Commuter  |  Bikes can be carried free of charge during off-peak times. You are not allowed to bring a bike on board at these busy times:  Monday – Friday, before 10:00am  Monday – Friday, 3:30pm – 7:00pm  Folding bikes (that are folded and covered) can be carried at all times free of charge. You can travel with bikes all day Saturday and Sunday.   
Bus Éireann  |  You can bring a bike if there is space in the luggage compartment.  Folding bikes must be folded and covered.*   
Dublin Bus  Luas tram  |  Folding bikes (carried or stored in the luggage area)  Folding bikes (that are folded and in a protective case or bag) can be carried free of charge. You are not allowed to bring a full-size bike on board.   
  
* Since 7 April 2024, the €10 bicycle in transit charge on public service (PSO) routes has been removed. This also applies to the carriage of additional luggage and non-folding child pushchairs. The €5 charge remains on Expressway services. 

##  Bike sharing schemes

If you don’t bring a bike on your journey, you can combine public transport
with bike hire at your destination. A bike sharing scheme allows you to use
bikes affordably and take or leave them at various docking stations across a
city.

Ireland has many private bike hire companies with information available
locally. There are 5 major bike share schemes.

###  **Dublin**

Dublin Bikes are available to anyone over the age of 14.

You can hire a Dublin Bike by:

  * Buying either a 1-day ticket, or a 3-day ticket 
  * Taking out an annual subscription. 

See [ dublinbikes.ie ](https://www.dublinbikes.ie/en/home) for details and
pricing.

You can link a [ Transport for Ireland Leap Card
](https://www.leapcard.ie/Home/index.html) to a Dublin Bikes account by
registering at [ Dublinbikes.ie ](http://www.dublinbikes.ie/) .

[ Bleeper ](https://www.bleeperactive.com/) is a stationless bike sharing
scheme available in Dublin. You can unlock a BleeperBike using a smartphone
app. This allows you to pick up a BleeperBike at any public cycle parking area
and return it to any other public cycle parking location within the city.
Users are charged per bike ride. Monthly membership of €17.50 allows for up to
one-hour unlimited bike rides every day. (Fees are charged at the pay-as-you-
go rate after the first hour.)

###  **Cork, Galway and Limerick**

Cork, Galway and Limerick run their own city-wide bike sharing schemes. Bikes
are available for rent at docking stations around the city. An annual
subscription costs €10 with 3-day passes for €3. The first 30 minutes of your
bike ride is free and hourly charges apply afterwards.

See [ bikeshare.ie ](https://www.bikeshare.ie/) for more details on where to
find the bikes and how to sign up for the bike share scheme.

###  **Can I use an electric bike in Ireland?**

Electric bicycles or e-bikes are growing in popularity and can be bought under
the [ Cycle to Work Scheme ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/travel-and-
recreation/cycling/cycle-to-work-scheme/) . You can find out more about [
e-bikes ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/travel-and-
recreation/e-scooters-e-bikes-and-e-mopeds/e-bikes/) .

##  Greenway trails

Some of Ireland’s greenways were built along the routes of old railways in
Mayo, Waterford, Westmeath, and Limerick.

You can [ find a list of routes on Cycling Ireland
](https://www.cyclingireland.ie/get-involved/find-a-route/) .

###  **Mayo**

Ireland’s first dedicated greenway, the [ Great Western Greenway
](https://www.greenway.ie/great-western-greenway/) opened in 2012 and runs for
44 km, following the route of the Westport to Achill railway line which closed
in 1937.

###  **Waterford**

The [ Waterford Greenway ](https://waterfordgreenway.com/) opened in 2017 and
runs 46 km from Waterford City to Dungarvan.

###  **Limerick**

In Limerick the [ Great Southern Trail ](http://www.southerntrail.net/) runs
36 km from Rathkeale to Abbeyfeale.

###  **Athlone, Mullingar and Longford**

The 40km [ Old Rail Trail
](http://www.westmeathcoco.ie/en/ourservices/artsandrecreation/greenways/oldrailtrail-
routemap/) in the midlands, links Athlone to Mullingar. At the Mullingar end,
the Old Rail Trail joins the Royal Canal Greenway, which follows the route of
the Royal Canal out of Dublin north to Clondra in Co Longford.

The [ Royal Canal Greenway ](https://greenwaysireland.org/royal-canal-
greenway/) is Ireland’s longest greenway. Cyclists can start their greenway
cycling in Dublin and bike to the midlands, going north on the Royal Canal
Greenway to Longford or continuing west along the Old Rail Trail to Athlone.

###  **Cork and Wicklow**

Other greenway schemes are being developed in Cork and Wicklow.

The [ Midleton to Youghal Greenway
](https://www.corkcoco.ie/en/resident/greenways/midleton-to-youghal-greenway)
in Co Cork and the [ Blessington Greenway
](https://wicklowgreenways.ie/blessington-lakes-egreenway1/blessington-
egreenways) in Co Wicklow taking in Russborough House and the villages of
Valleymount, Ballyknockan and Lacken.
