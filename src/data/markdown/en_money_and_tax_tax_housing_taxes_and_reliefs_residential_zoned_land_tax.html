##  What is the Residential Zoned Land Tax?

A new Residential Zoned Land Tax (RZLT) will be charged each year on land
that:

  * Is zoned for residential use and 
  * Has access to necessary services such as water supply, roads and lighting 

If your property is liable for [ Local Property Tax ](/en/money-and-
tax/tax/housing-taxes-and-reliefs/local-property-tax/) , it is a residential
property and you do not have to pay RZLT for it.

##  How do I check if land is liable for Residential Zoned Land Tax?

Land that is liable for RZLT is shown on a map.

RZLT maps are published each year by local authorities. [ For 2025, draft maps
were published on 1 February 2024
](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/fbad0-residential-zoned-land-tax/#how-
will-you-be-able-to-view-your-councils-annual-draft-map) . You could make a
submission about land that should be added or removed, up to 1 April 2024.

The final map for 2025 will be published on 31 January 2025.

If your residential property is shown on the map, you do not have to make a
submission to remove it if the property is liable to [ Local Property Tax
](/en/money-and-tax/tax/housing-taxes-and-reliefs/local-property-tax/) because
this means that it will not be liable for RZLT.

If you are a landowner and you make a submission, you can appeal the decision
of a local authority if you do not agree with it.

##  Do I have to pay Residential Zoned Land Tax?

If land is included on the final RZLT map and you are the owner of it on the
liability date, you must pay RZLT unless it is [ property that is excluded
](https://www.revenue.ie/en/property/residential-zoned-land/due-date-excluded-
properties.aspx) .

RZLT does not apply to existing residential properties. If your property is
liable for [ Local Property Tax ](/en/money-and-tax/tax/housing-taxes-and-
reliefs/local-property-tax/) , it is a residential property and you do not
have to pay RZLT for it.

If your residential property has a garden or yard that is larger than 0.4047
hectares (1 acre) and is included on the RZLT map, you have to register for
RZLT but you do not have to pay the tax.

##  When do I have to pay the Residential Zoned Land Tax?

It was announced in [ Budget 2024
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/money-and-tax/budgets/budget-2024/)
that the introduction of the Residential Zoned Land Tax (RZLT) is deferred by
one year. This means that the first payment date will be in 2025 for property
that is liable on 1 February 2025

##  How much is the Residential Zoned Land Tax?

The rate of RZLT is 3% of the market value of the land. The market value is
self-assessed by the landowner.
