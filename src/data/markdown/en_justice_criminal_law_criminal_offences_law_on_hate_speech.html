#  The law on hate speech

  * What is hate speech? 
  * The current law on hate speech in Ireland 
  * How to report hate speech 
  * Proposed changes to the law 

##  What is hate speech?

In Irish law, hate speech is any communication that is made in public with the
intention or likelihood of being threatening or abusive and likely to stir up
hatred against people because of their:

  * Race 
  * Colour 
  * Nationality 
  * Religion 
  * Ethnic or national origin 
  * Membership of the traveler community 
  * Sexual orientation 

The communication can be spoken, published or broadcast. Communication made in
a private residence that cannot be seen or heard by people outside the
residence is not included.

##  The current law on hate speech in Ireland

The [ Prohibition of Incitement to Hatred Act 1989
](https://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1989/act/19/enacted/en/print.html) sets
out the law on hate speech.

It says that it is an offence to communicate threatening, abusive or insulting
material that is intended, or likely to, “stir up” hatred against a group of
people because of their race, colour, nationality, religion, ethnic or
national origins, membership of the travelling community or sexual
orientation.

The communication can be spoken, in writing, broadcast or part of a recording.

If the person did not intend to stir up hatred, they can defend a charge by
proving that they did not know the content of the material, and had no reason
to suspect that the material was threatening, abusive or insulting.

###  Private residences

You cannot be convicted of inciting hatred for things you say in a private
residence, unless the words, behaviour or material are heard or seen by
someone outside the residence. You may not be guilty of an offence if you were
in a private residence and had no reason to believe that your words, behaviour
or material would be heard or seen by someone outside.

###  Who is responsible for broadcasts?

A broadcast is any transmission that is intended to be received by the general
public.

If material that is intended to stir up hatred (or is likely to stir up hatred
even if not intended) is broadcast, all of the following may have committed an
offence:

  * The broadcaster (for example, the TV channel) 
  * The people who produced or directed the broadcast 
  * The person who made the threatening or abusive statement 

The broadcaster, producer or director of the broadcast may be able to avoid
prosecution if the material was not intended to stir up hatred and:

  * They did not know, and had no reason to suspect, that the offending material was in the broadcast or 
  * They could not have removed the offending material for practical reasons 

The producer or director may also be able to avoid prosecution if they can
show they did not know and had no reason to believe that that the item would
be broadcast or that it would be likely to stir up hatred.

The person who made the statement may be able to defend their actions if they
can show that they did not know and had no reason to suspect that the material
would be broadcast, or that the broadcast would stir up hatred.

Any person charged in respect of a broadcast can also use a defence of not
knowing or not having reason to suspect that the material was threatening,
abusive or insulting.

###  Preparing or possessing offending material

It is also an offence to prepare or to have in your possession any offending
written material, sound recording or visual images, that you (or someone else)
intend to distribute, broadcast, display or publish either in Ireland or
abroad.

##  How to report hate speech

You can report hate speech in any of the following ways:

  * At your [ local Garda station ](https://www.garda.ie/en/contact-us/station-directory/)
  * By contacting the Garda confidential phone line on 1800 666111 
  * Report a hate crime on the [ Garda website ](https://www.garda.ie/en/reportahatecrime/)
  * Report racist or xenophobic online content on [ Hotline.ie ](https://www.hotline.ie/)

###  Social media

Social media companies can remove hateful content. You can read how to report
hate speech on:

  * [ Twitter ](https://help.twitter.com/en/safety-and-security/report-abusive-behavior)
  * [ Facebook ](https://www.facebook.com/help/212722115425932)
  * [ TikTok ](https://support.tiktok.com/en/safety-hc/report-a-problem/report-a-video)
  * [ Instagram ](https://help.instagram.com/443165679053819)
  * [ LinkedIn ](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/37822/recognize-and-report-spam-inappropriate-and-abusive-content?lang=en)

##  Proposed changes to the law

New proposed laws on hate speech have been published and are currently being [
debated in the Oireachtas ](/en/government-in-ireland/houses-of-the-
oireachtas/legislation/) . The [ Criminal Justice (Incitement to Violence or
Hatred and Hate Offences) Bill 2022
](https://www.oireachtas.ie/en/bills/bill/2022/105/) will (if enacted):

  * Create new laws to deal with hate crimes 
  * Expand the protected characteristics to include gender (including gender identity and expression) and disability 
  * Make it an offence to deny or trivialise genocide 

A hate crime is any criminal offence which is perceived by the victim, or any
other person, to have been motivated by prejudice based on a person’s age,
disability race, colour, nationality, ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation,
or gender. Ireland does not currently have specific laws that deal with hate
crimes.

The new law will replace the Prohibition of Incitement to Hatred Act 1989.
