###  Best interests of the patient

If you are admitted to or are receiving treatment in a psychiatric hospital or
other inpatient service, the Mental Health Act 2001 makes sure that your best
interests are considered before any decision about your care and treatment is
made.

You should be included in discussions with your care team about where your
best interests lie to help you with your recovery. You are entitled to take
part in decisions that affect your health. Your care team should consider your
views carefully.

You have the right to be:

  * Treated with dignity and respect 
  * Listened to by all those working on your care team. 
  * Fully informed about your legal rights, admission, and treatment
