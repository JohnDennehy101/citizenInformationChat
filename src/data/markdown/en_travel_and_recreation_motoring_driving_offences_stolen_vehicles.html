##  How to report a stolen vehicle

Every day cars are stolen from their owners. A car can sometimes be stolen
because of carelessness on the part of the owner, for example, by leaving your
vehicle unlocked or unattended in public places.

If your vehicle is stolen, you should report this to the Gardaí immediately
and call your insurance company. You can find the location of your nearest
Garda Station on [ Garda.ie ](http://www.garda.ie/Stations/Default.aspx) .

Vehicles reported as stolen are entered into a central database that all Garda
stations in Ireland can access. Vehicles reported as stolen can be monitored
and tracked by the Gardaí across the country.

###  Call your insurance company

Your insurance company will tell you how to make an insurance claim.

##  How to prevent your car from being stolen

It's important to be aware of the potential risks when you leave your vehicle
unattended (for even a few moments) in a public place. It's also important to
be mindful of parking, particularly when you park in daylight but return much
later in darkness.

These are some general safety tips and way to prevent your car from being
stolen:

  * Park in a well-lit area if possible 
  * Make sure your car is locked and your car alarm is switched on, or use a steering lock 
  * Do not leave valuables inside the car 
  * Never leave your car running and unattended 
  * Store your keys safely, away from windows and letterboxes in your home
