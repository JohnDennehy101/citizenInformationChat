##  What is rehabilitative training?

The purpose of rehabilitative training is to give people with disabilities an
opportunity to train and learn important life skills such as decision-making,
planning, social and basic work skills.

Rehabilitative training can help you if you have an intellectual disability,
autism, mental health difficulty or complex physical disabilities. It aims to
improve your quality of life and promote independence and participation in the
community.

Rehabilitative training can also be a stepping stone to more mainstream
education or other training options such as the [ Vocational Training
Opportunities Scheme ](/en/education/further-education-and-
training/vocational-training-opportunities-scheme/) .

Rehabilitative training is not linked to employment.

##  Who provides rehabilitative training?

HSE Disability Services organise the delivery of rehabilitative training
services in accredited training centres that are run by the HSE or by service
providers contracted by the HSE.

The HSE Occupational Guidance Service can help you find a training course that
is suited to your needs. They will meet you and your family or advocate and
look at your options. The type of training and support may differ from centre
to centre.

[ Contact your local HSE Disability Office
](https://www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/4/disability/disabilityservicescounty.html)
or service provider for specific information on the programmes they run and to
check if you are eligible to attend.

In some cases, the local disability service provider may organise transport
and travel to and from your rehabilitative training service.

##  What will I learn in rehabilitative training?

Rehabilitative training courses vary in length, with some taking 2 to 4 years
to complete. The course will include individualised programme skills such as
learning how to:

  * Make choices and plans 
  * Make transitions and progress 
  * Access education and formal learning 
  * Maximise your personal independence 
  * Look after your health and wellbeing 
  * Access bridging programmes to [ vocational training ](/en/education/further-education-and-training/vocational-training-opportunities-scheme/)
  * Access [ vocational training ](/en/education/further-education-and-training/vocational-training-opportunities-scheme/) and work opportunities 

You will be supported to develop and review your training plan during your
training in line with your needs and abilities.

##  Will I get paid for doing rehabilitative training?

No, but you can continue to receive your social welfare payments while
training. You may also be eligible for the Rehabilitative Training Bonus (see
below).

Check if you are eligible for weekly [ Disability Allowance ](/en/social-
welfare/disability-and-illness/disability-allowance/) or other [ social
welfare payments for people living with a disability ](/en/social-
welfare/disability-and-illness/) .

###  **Rehabilitative Training Bonus**

If you are a trainee in foundation training or in a sheltered workshop you
will continue to get any social welfare payments you are entitled to, such as
Disability Allowance.

If you started rehabilitative training before 1 September 2019, you will get a
training bonus of â‚¬31.80 a week until you finish your placement. You cannot
get the Rehabilitative Training Bonus if you started rehabilitative training
after 1 September 2019.

If you are in training for less than 5 days a week, this will be paid on a
pro-rata basis. For example, if you attend 2 days per week, you will get 2/5
of the allowance.

##  How to apply for rehabilitative training

You should contact Disability Services in your [ Local Health Office
](http://www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/1/LHO/) for more information on
rehabilitative training in your area. They will put you in touch with an
advisor from the HSE Occupational Guidance service.

If you are a school leaver it is important to plan in advance and contact the
HSE at least 13 months before you leave school.
