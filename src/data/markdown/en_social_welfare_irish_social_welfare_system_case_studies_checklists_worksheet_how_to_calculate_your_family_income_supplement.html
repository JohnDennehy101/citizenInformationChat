#  Worksheet: How to calculate your Working Family Payment

  * Worksheet 

##  Worksheet

###  This worksheet will help you to work out the amount of Working Family
Payment you may get (2024).

[ Working Family Payment (WFP) ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-
welfare/social-welfare-payments/families-and-children/working-family-payment/)
is a weekly tax-free payment for employees with children.

To qualify for WFP, your average total weekly family income must be below a
certain amount for your family size. WFP pays 60% of the difference between
your total family income and the income limit which applies to your family.

To find out your weekly rate of WFP, firstly calculate your total family
income. Secondly, take away your total family income from the maximum income
limit set for your family size (see table below).

The WFP rate you get is 60% of the difference between your total family income
and the income limit which applies to your family, rounded up to the nearest
euro.

####  **Benefit of Work Estimator**

You can also use a [ benefit of work estimator
](https://www.mywelfare.ie/benefitofworkjsestimator) from the Department of
Social Protection to help you assess out the financial consequences of taking
up full-time work.

The estimator works out the total amount you would get if you take up full-
time work (including any Working Family Payment) and compares this to what you
are getting in jobseeker payments (including [ Rent Supplement
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/social-welfare-
payments/supplementary-welfare-schemes/rent-supplement/) ).

###  Step 1: Calculate your total income

Weekly net household income from employment - see Note 1 below____________

**Add** net weekly household income from  
self-employment - see Note 2 below ____________

**Add** social welfare payments - see Note 3 below ____________

**Add** income from occupational pensions ____________

**Add** income from maintenance - see Note 4 below ____________

**Total Family Income** = ___________

**Note 1**

Weekly household income from employment is your weekly income from employment
and your spouse’s, civil partner's or cohabitant's weekly income from
employment.

Net earnings for WFP purposes is gross pay minus [ tax
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/money-and-tax/tax/income-tax/) , [
PRSI ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/irish-social-
welfare-system/social-insurance-prsi/paying-social-insurance/) , [ Universal
Social Charge ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/money-and-
tax/tax/income-tax/universal-social-charge/) and superannuation.

If a dependent child has income from employment, it is not taken into account.

**Note 2**

Net weekly household income from self-employment includes the net weekly
income from self-employment of both you and your spouse, civil partner or
cohabitant.

If a dependent child has income from self-employment, it is not taken into
account.

**Note 3**

Income from some social welfare payments are taken into account. All income
from carer's payments are taken into account.

However, the following payments **are not** taken into account:

  * [ Child Benefit ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/social-welfare-payments/families-and-children/child-benefit/)
  * [ Guardian’s Payment (Non-Contributory) and Guardian’s Payment (Contributory) ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/social-welfare-payments/death-related-benefits/guardian-and-orphan-payments/)
  * [ Supplementary Welfare Allowance ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/social-welfare-payments/supplementary-welfare-schemes/supplementary-welfare-allow/)
  * [ Fuel Allowance ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/social-welfare-payments/extra-social-welfare-benefits/fuel-allowance/)
  * [ Domiciliary Care Allowance ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/social-welfare-payments/disability-and-illness/domiciliary-care-allowance/)
  * [ Foster Child Allowance ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/birth-family-relationships/adoption-and-fostering/fostering/#60a83b)
  * [ Rent Supplement ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/social-welfare-payments/supplementary-welfare-schemes/rent-supplement/)

**Note 4**

All income from maintenance is assessed, **except maintenance payments for a
child** . If you are getting maintenance from more than one person, all the
payments are added together, and the total is assessed as means.

Your housing costs (your rent or mortgage repayment) up to a maximum of €95.23
per week can be offset against maintenance payments. Half the balance is then
assessed as means. You cannot offset your housing costs against maintenance
payments for WFP, if you have already done so in the means test for another
social welfare payment.

Non-cash benefits are not assessed as means. For example, if your rent or
mortgage payments are made by an ex-spouse or partner under a maintenance
agreement, it is not assessed.

Only one Working Family Payment can be made in respect of any family – the
parent from whom you are getting maintenance must not be getting WFP.

###  Step 2: Take away your total income from the maximum income limit for
your family size

In the table below, find the maximum income limit for a family with the number
of children you have. From this maximum income limit for your family size,
take away your total family income.

**Working Family Payment income limits from 4 January 2024**

**If you have:** |  **And your weekly family income is less than:**  
---|---  
One child  |  €645   
Two children  |  €746   
Three children  |  €847   
Four children  |  €938   
Five children  |  €1,064   
Six children  |  €1,180   
Seven children  |  €1,316   
Eight or more children  |  €1,412   
  
For example, if you have 3 children and your weekly total family income is
€350, the maximum family income for a family of your size is €847 (see table
above).

The difference between €350 and €847 is €497.

###  Step 3: Get 60% of the difference between your total family income and
the maximum income limit set for a family of your size

To find out the WFP rate you will get: calculate 60% of the difference between
your total family income and the maximum income limit set for a family of your
size.

For example, if you have 3 children and your weekly total family income is
€350, the maximum family income for a family of your size is €847 (see table
above). The difference between €350 and €847 is €497.

Your rate of WFP is 60% of €497. In this case, €298.20 is 60% of €497. Your
WFP rate is €298 (rounded).
