##  Introduction

An antenatal visit is any appointment with your GP or maternity unit that
relates to your pregnancy.

If you have registered for the [ Maternity and Infant Care Scheme
](/en/health/health-services/reproductive_health/maternity-and-infant-welfare-
services/) you will have some of your antenatal appointments with your GP and
the others with your maternity unit. The schedule of antenatal appointments
can be different depending on your pregnancy.

  * If it is your first pregnancy, you will usually have 6 antenatal appointments with your GP, and 6 antenatal appointments at your maternity unit or hospital. 
  * If it is a second or subsequent pregnancy, you will usually have 7 antenatal appointments with your GP, and 5 antenatal appointments at your maternity unit or hospital. 

You may have additional appointments if you are diagnosed with a pregnancy-
related condition (such as high blood pressure or gestational diabetes, or if
you are pregnant with twins or multiple babies).

You will also have 2 postnatal appointments with your GP _after_ your baby has
arrived, at 2 weeks (for your baby) and 6 weeks (for you and your baby).

If you have registered for the [ Maternity and Infant Care Scheme
](/en/health/health-services/reproductive_health/maternity-and-infant-welfare-
services/) , these antenatal and postnatal visits are free.

You are entitled to take paid time off from your employment to attend
antenatal appointments (and some antenatal classes). Your employment rights
during pregnancy are protected in [ Irish law
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1994/en/act/pub/0034/index.html) .

##  Pregnancy and COVID-19

If you are pregnant and think you may have been exposed to COVID-19, contact
your GP. Most women who test positive and have mild symptoms can safely self-
isolate at home (7 days). Routine antenatal or ultrasound appointments should
be postponed until after the period of self-isolation.

If you have not had any COVID-19 vaccines, you can get your first round of
COVID-19 vaccination or first booster at any stage of your pregnancy.

If you had a booster dose during your current pregnancy, then a second booster
dose is not needed.

If you had a booster dose before this pregnancy, you can get your second
booster at or after 16 weeks of your pregnancy.

Find more information on getting the [ COVID-19 vaccine during pregnancy
](https://www2.hse.ie/conditions/covid19/people-at-higher-risk/covid19-and-
pregnancy/) , and [ getting the vaccine while trying for a baby or
breastfeeding ](https://www2.hse.ie/screening-and-
vaccinations/covid-19-vaccine/get-the-vaccine/pregnancy/) on the HSE website.

If you are unsure about whether to get a vaccination before, during or after
pregnancy, you can [ read the HSEâ€™s information booklet (pdf)
](https://www.hse.ie/eng/health/immunisation/hcpinfo/guidelines/covid19.pdf) .

##  Antenatal visits

Many hospitals have made changes to how they deliver their services due to
COVID-19. If you have an upcoming antenatal visit, you may have to attend your
appointment alone. **Check what visitor restrictions are in place with your
maternity hospital/unit.** The HSE has up-to-date information on hospitals in
every county so you can check about [ appointments and what visitor
restrictions are in place ](https://www2.hse.ie/services/hospital-service-
disruptions/hospital-service-disruptions-covid19.html#local-hospital-updates)
before you go.

##  Your first antenatal visit

If you have registered for the [ Maternity and Infant Care Scheme
](/en/health/health-services/reproductive_health/maternity-and-infant-welfare-
services/) , your first appointment will be with your GP. They will do
antenatal checks (such as blood pressure and urine checks) and give you
information on how to have a healthy pregnancy. They will help you estimate
your due date, and they might discuss folic acid, exercise and healthy eating
with you.

Your GP will also talk to you about vaccines. You will be offered a [ flu
vaccine ](https://www.hse.ie/eng/health/immunisation/pubinfo/flu-
vaccination/flu-vaccine-pregnancy/) during one of your appointments (the flu
season is from October to April). While the appointment will be free, you may
be charged for the administration of the flu vaccine if you do not have a
medical card.

When you are between 16-36 weeks, you will also be offered a vaccination to
protect your baby from [ whooping cough (pertussis)
](https://www2.hse.ie/conditions/child-health/whooping-cough-in-babies-and-
children/how-whooping-cough-affects-children.html) . This is available free of
charge.

##  Your first visit to the hospital or maternity unit

Your first visit to the hospital or maternity unit is called a â€˜booking
visitâ€™.

During this appointment, you will:

  * Tell a midwife about your medical history, family history and any previous pregnancies. 
  * Have your blood pressure checked. 
  * Have your urine checked. 
  * Have a [ blood test ](https://www2.hse.ie/wellbeing/child-health/blood-tests-offered-in-pregnancy/blood-tests-offered-in-pregnancy.html) . 
  * Get information about [ antenatal classes ](https://www2.hse.ie/wellbeing/child-health/antenatal-classes.html) and [ breastfeeding ](https://www2.hse.ie/babies-and-toddlers/breastfeeding/) . 
  * Be referred for specialist appointments if needed (for example, with physiotherapists, dietitians, smoking cessation specialists or alcohol cessation specialists). 
  * Have the opportunity to ask the midwife any questions. 

In some hospitals, you may have an ultrasound scan on your first visit, at
others you will have it at around 20 weeks.

Your first visit to hospital will last approximately 2 hours. If your
pregnancy is normal, follow-up visits will be much shorter.

##  Subsequent visits

At each follow-up antenatal visit, your blood pressure will be checked, you
will give a urine sample, and you will be examined.

If you have any questions or worries related to your pregnancy, you should ask
the midwife or doctor.

###  At 20-22 weeks

You have reached the halfway point of your pregnancy.

You may be offered a foetal anomaly or anatomy scan at the hospital. Some
hospitals offer this to every pregnant woman and other hospitals can only
offer this to women with higher risk pregnancies. Most scans will show you
that your baby is developing normally. However, sometimes a baby is born with
a health problem. A foetal anatomy scan will detect many of these problems.

If an anomaly is detected, a referral will be made to an obstetrician who
specialises in foetal anomalies. This allows you and your obstetrician to make
plans for the birth and for any aftercare you and your baby may need.

###  From 28 weeks

Your midwife or doctor will continue to monitor your health. They will check
for signs of high blood pressure or other complications.

They will also check the position of your baby and the babyâ€™s development, as
well as the height of your womb (uterus) and your babyâ€™s heart rate.

You may not need to be scanned after your scan at [ 20 weeks
](https://www2.hse.ie/wellbeing/child-health/17-to-20-weeks-pregnant.html) ,
unless you are advised that you need one.

Your midwife or obstetrician will also talk to you about:

  * Preparing for the birth 
  * Breastfeeding 
  * Any concerns you may have 

##  Employment and antenatal visits

If you become pregnant while you are employed, you are [ entitled to paid time
off work to attend antenatal appointments
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1995/si/18/made/en/print) .

You should tell your employer in writing (providing medical evidence of your
pregnancy) that you need time off to attend antenatal appointments. You should
give at least 2 weeks' written notice of the date and time of your
appointments.

If this notice is not given for reasons out of your control, then you can
retain your entitlement, provided you write to your employer with an
explanation and with the notice. You will need to do this within 1 week of the
appointment.

For any visit after the first appointment, your employer may ask to see your
appointment card. You are entitled to medical visits after the birth of your
baby for 14 weeks following the birth, including any period taken on [
maternity leave ](/en/employment/employment-rights-and-conditions/leave-and-
holidays/maternity-leave/) following the birth.

##  Employment and antenatal classes

You may also be entitled to take paid time off from work to attend [ antenatal
classes ](/en/birth-family-relationships/before-your-baby-is-born/antenatal-
classes/) . Check with your local hospital about [ antenatal classes
](/en/birth-family-relationships/before-your-baby-is-born/antenatal-classes/)
as many have moved online.

Antenatal classes cover a wide range of topics such as pain relief, [
breastfeeding ](/en/birth-family-relationships/after-your-baby-is-
born/breastfeeding/) , nutrition, maintaining a healthy lifestyle, and
preparing you and your family for the birth of your baby. Most hospitals offer
antenatal classes (sometimes called parent craft classes) which you can attend
near the time of birth. Your partner or a friend can attend these classes with
you.

If you are an expectant mother, [ you are entitled to attend 1 set of classes
(except the last 3 in a set)
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2004/en/act/pub/0028/index.html) over all
your pregnancies while in employment. For example, if you are attending a set
of 8 classes and this is your first pregnancy in employment, you are only
entitled to paid time off work to attend 5 of those classes. The last 3
classes would normally occur after your maternity leave has started.

If you are an expectant father, you have [ a once-off right to attend the 2
classes immediately prior to the birth
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2004/en/si/0653.html) .
