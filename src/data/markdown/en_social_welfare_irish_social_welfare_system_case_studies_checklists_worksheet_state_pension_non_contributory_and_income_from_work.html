**Total Net Income** ____________

####  **Note 1**

€200 of income from insurable employment is not taken into account. Any amount
above this is assessed as means. All income from self-employment is assessed
as means.

####  **Note 2**

If a qualified adult is working, €200 of income from insurable employment is
not taken into account. Any amount above this is assessed as means. All income
from self-employment is assessed as means.

####  **Note 3**

If you are married in a civil partnership or cohabiting with another person,
your means will be taken as half the joint means of you and your spouse, civil
partner or cohabitant.

####  **Note 4**

If your means are more than €30 you can get a reduced pension. You can find
out the [ rate of pension paid after means are assessed
](https://assets.gov.ie/11117/6beb1ad2f51346f4ad6f27db1c473e59.pdf) .

####  **Note 5**

If you are over 70, you pay no [ PRSI ](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-
welfare-system/social-insurance-prsi/social-insurance-classes/) .

If your spouse, civil partner or cohabitant is under 70, they are not liable
for PRSI if they meet any of the following:

  * They are getting a State Pension (Contributory) 
  * They turned 66 before 1 January 2024 
  * They are earning less than €352 per week 

####  **Note 6**

Multiply total Gross Income by 20% to get the gross amount [ of income tax
payable each week ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/money-and-
tax/tax/income-tax/how-your-tax-is-calculated/#354b71) . From this figure
subtract, your Weekly Tax Credit to get the amount of weekly tax paid.

  * Single Person = €76.83 
  * Married Couple (one person working and one person over 65) = €112.88 
  * Married Couple (one person working and both over 65) = €117.60 
  * Married couple (both working and one person over 65) = €148.94 
  * Married couple (both working and both over 65) = €153.65 

The calculations for these weekly tax credits are shown below.

####  **Universal Social Charge**

You will pay a [ Universal Social Charge (USC) ](/en/money-and-tax/tax/income-
tax/universal-social-charge/) on your gross income from work. The amount of
USC you will pay depends on your income and your age.
