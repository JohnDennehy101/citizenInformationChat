##  Introduction

Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are very common. They can affect people
of all ages and backgrounds. If you are worried about an STI, you can get
information and help, and treatment if you need it.

This page has information on sexual health, including sexually transmitted
infections (STIs), how to get an STI test and how to prevent STIs.

##  What is a sexually transmitted infection (STI)?

A sexually transmitted infection (STI) is an infection you can get if you have
sexual activity with an infected person.

The [ HSE website sexualwellbeing.ie ](https://www.sexualwellbeing.ie/sexual-
health/sexually-transmitted-infections/types-of-stis/) has information on
sexual health and common STIs in Ireland such as chlamydia, syphilis, HIV and
others.

If you are worried about an STI, you should visit your GP, pharmacist or an [
STI clinic ](https://www.sexualwellbeing.ie/sexual-health/hse-sti-services-in-
ireland.html) for medical advice.

STIs do not always have [ symptoms ](https://www.sexualwellbeing.ie/sexual-
health/sexually-transmitted-infections/what-if-i-think-i-have-an-sti-/) .
Untreated STIs can cause serious health problems so it is important to get
tested regularly.

##  Where can I get an STI test in Ireland?

You should get an STI test if:

  * You have any [ symptoms of an STI ](https://www.sexualwellbeing.ie/sexual-health/sexually-transmitted-infections/what-if-i-think-i-have-an-sti-/)
  * Your sexual partner has an STI 
  * You have a new sexual partner 
  * You have more than one sexual partner 

###  Ordering a free STI test to your home

If you are aged over 17 and living in Ireland you can [ order a free STI test
online ](https://sh24.ie/) to take at home. If there are no more kits
available to order, try again the following morning. Your STI test kit will
arrive in a plain envelope that fits through letterboxes.

###  How to take a free home STI test

You will find instructions on how to take the STI test kit and a stamped
addressed envelope to post your completed test kit back to the lab. You will
get your results by phone or text message within 72 hours of the samples
arriving at the lab.

###  Getting tested at an STI clinic

Some hospitals and clinics also offer free STI tests. [ Check where your
closest STI test centre is located. ](https://www.sexualwellbeing.ie/sexual-
health/hse-sti-services-in-ireland.html)

You can also get STI tests from many GPs, student health services or NGOs (for
example HIV Ireland) but you may have to pay for your test.

You can [ read about what happens during an STI test and what happens if you
test positive for an STI ](https://www.sexualwellbeing.ie/sexual-
health/sexually-transmitted-infections/what-if-i-think-i-have-an-sti-/) on the
HSE website.

##  Preventing STIs

Using [ condoms ](https://www.sexualwellbeing.ie/sexual-
health/contraception/your-choices/condoms/) reduces your risk of getting an
STI. You can get free condoms from:

  * [ Sexual health or GUM (genitourinary medicine) clinics ](https://www.sexualwellbeing.ie/sexual-health/hse-sti-services-in-ireland.html)
  * Some sexual health NGOs 
  * Many third level colleges 

You can buy condoms without a prescription from many supermarkets, newsagents
and pharmacies in Ireland.

You can [ read about other ways to reduce your risk of getting an STI.
](https://www.sexualwellbeing.ie/sexual-health/sexually-transmitted-
infections/how-do-i-prevent-stis-/)

###  Vaccines to prevent STIs

Vaccines can prevent some infections that passed during sexual activity
including the [ Human Papillomavirus (HPV)
](https://www.hse.ie/eng/health/immunisation/pubinfo/schoolprog/hpv/hpv-human-
papillomavirus/) and Hepatitis A and B.

Some [ public STI clinics offer free vaccinations
](https://www.sexualwellbeing.ie/sexual-health/hse-sti-services-in-
ireland.html) . These are generally available to people who may be at risk of
contracting an infection through sexual transmission.

You can [ get more information about vaccination against infections that are
sexually transmitted ](https://www.sexualwellbeing.ie/sexual-
health/vaccinations/vaccinations.html) from the HSE.
