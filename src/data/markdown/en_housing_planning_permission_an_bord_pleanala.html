##  What is An Bord Pleanála?

An Bord Pleanála is the national planning appeals board. It is an independent
body which runs an open and impartial planning appeal system.

###  How does it work?

If you apply to your local authority for [ planning permission,
](/en/housing/planning-permission/planning-permission/) the local authority
reviews the application and any submissions or observations on it before they
make a decision.

When they make a decision, you or anyone who has made a submission on the
application can appeal the local authority's decision to An Bord Pleanála.

For more on making an appeal, see our page ‘ [ Appealing a planning permission
decision ](/en/housing/planning-permission/appealing-planning-permission-
decision/) ’.

##  What issues do An Bord Pleanála deal with?

**An Board Pleanála deals with:**

  * [ Normal planning appeals ](https://www.pleanala.ie/en-ie/functions-of-the-board/functions-of-the-board-normal-planning-appeals) : these are appeals about a planning authorities decision to accept, refuse or add conditions to planning permission 
  * [ Other planning appeals ](https://www.pleanala.ie/en-ie/functions-of-the-board/functions-of-the-board-other-planning-appeals) : the Board deals with lots of other planning appeals, for example, appeals about rights of way, cancelling planning permission, removing structures and planning schemes in strategic development zones 
  * [ Other appeals ](https://www.pleanala.ie/en-ie/functions-of-the-board/functions-of-the-board-other-appeals) : the Board deals with a range of other appeals under different legislation. For example, appeals about a planning authority’s decision to register a site as vacant and appeals about the application of building regulations. 
  * [ Referrals ](https://www.pleanala.ie/en-ie/functions-of-the-board/functions-of-the-board-referrals) : An Bord Pleanála can decide on certain planning issues that are referred to it. For example, a planning authority may ask the Board to decide if a development is an exempted development. 
  * Local authority infrastructure projects 
  * [ Compulsory acquisition of land ](https://www.pleanala.ie/en-ie/functions-of-the-board/functions-of-the-board-compulsory-acquisition-of-l)
  * Applications for [ strategic infrastructure projects ](https://www.pleanala.ie/en-ie/functions-of-the-board/functions-of-the-board-strategic-infrastructure-de) , such as major road and rail projects 
  * Applications for [ strategic housing developments ](https://www.pleanala.ie/en-ie/strategic-housing-development)
  * Other matters under the [ Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended ](http://revisedacts.lawreform.ie/eli/2000/act/30/revised/en/html)

**It is responsible for determining appeals under:**

  * The [ Planning and Development Act 2000 ](http://revisedacts.lawreform.ie/eli/2000/act/30/revised/en/html)
  * The [ Building Control Act 1990 ](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1990/en/act/pub/0003/index.html)
  * The Local Government (Water Pollution) Acts [ 1977 ](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1977/act/1/enacted/en/print.html) – [ 1990 ](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1990/act/21/enacted/en/html)
  * [ Other Acts ](https://www.pleanala.ie/en-IE/Functions-of-the-Board)

The Board may also deal with new matters and other matters may be transferred
or discontinued. The current functions of the Board are listed on [
pleanala.ie ](https://www.pleanala.ie/en-IE/Functions-of-the-Board) .

##  How is An Bord Pleanála structured?

An Bord Pleanála has a Chairperson and up to 17 other board members. It is
supported by an administrative staff and a professional staff of planning
officers and planning inspectors.

The Chairperson of the Board is appointed by the Government and holds office
for a term of 7 years. Board members are appointed by the Minister for
Housing, Local Government and Heritage and hold office for terms of 5 years.

The Chairperson and board members can be re-appointed for second or subsequent
terms.

More board members can be appointed if there is a high volume of cases.

The rules about membership of the board are set-out in the Planning and
Development Act 2000, as amended.

##  How does An Bord Pleanála make decisions?

###  Who makes the decisions?

Decisions about a planning appeal are never made by 1 person. This is to
ensure that An Bord Pleanála's decisions are fair and impartial.

Normally, you need a minimum of 3 board members to make decision. However, if
a case is particularly sensitive or complex, all board members are normally
involved in the decision-making process.

Members of the board, its employees and consultants are legally obliged to
declare certain interests. This is to avoid any conflict of interest arising
during the appeal process.

###  What do they consider when deciding?

An Bord Pleanála only makes their decision after they have considered all the
relevant material. This includes:

  * Submissions from the public 
  * The planning inspector's report and recommendation 

If their decision differs from the inspector's recommendation, they must give
reasons for this in their decision order.

The Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage can make decisions
about general planning and development policy and the board must take them
into account when making their decisions. However, the Minister cannot
influence the board about a particular appeal.

###  **Can they dismiss an appeal?**

An Bord Pleanála can dismiss an appeal in certain circumstances. For example,
if they believe the appeal was:

  * Only meant to annoy or disturb 
  * Not serious 
  * Without any real substance 
  * Made to delay the development 
  * Made for a profit (such as money or gifts) 
  * Made by someone who can’t be identified 

An Bord Pleanála aims to make a decisions on planning appeals within 18 weeks.
However, if this is not possible, they will contact everyone involved in the
appeal to update them.

There may be different timeframes in other types of cases. More information
can be found on [ pleanala.ie ](https://www.pleanala.ie/en-ie/making-a-
planning-appeal/after-you-make-your-appeal) .

###  Can a decision be appealed?

Once a decision is reached in a planning appeal, An Bord Pleanála will not
discuss the pros and cons of the decision.

All decisions are final and can only be challenged by judicial review in the
High Court on a point of law. In these situations, the High Court will judge
if An Bord Pleanála followed due process in reaching its decision, but will
not look at the planning merits of an appeal.

It is an offence to try and influence a board member’s decision about a
planning appeal.

###  Local authority development plans

An Bord Pleanála must make sure that all planning decisions stick to
principles of proper planning and sustainable development. If they feel that a
planning authority has not taken these principles into consideration, the
Board can go against the [ development plan ](/en/housing/planning-
permission/development-plans/) . Generally, this would only happen where the
proposed development is of local or national importance.

An Bord Pleanála tries to strike a balance between environmental and economic
considerations when they are determining appeals. In exceptional cases, they
will take issues of economic development and job creation into account when
making a decision.

###  Can I view other planning appeal cases?

You can view new and decided cases at [ pleanala.ie
](https://www.pleanala.ie/en-ie/lists) . Anyone can inspect the entire file on
an appeal for at least 5 years after the appeal is decided.
