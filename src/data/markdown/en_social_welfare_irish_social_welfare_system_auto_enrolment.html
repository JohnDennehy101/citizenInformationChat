##  What is Auto-enrolment?

Auto-enrolment is a new pension savings scheme for certain employees who are
not paying into a pension. They will be automatically included in the scheme
but can opt out after 6 months.

Auto-enrolment is expected to be introduced in January 2025. This page will be
updated as more detail becomes available.

Under the scheme, the employee, employer, and Government all pay a certain
amount into the employee’s pension fund.

A new public body, the National Automatic Enrolment Retirement Savings
Authority, will be set up to administer the Auto-enrolment scheme. The scheme
will be supervised by the [ Pensions Authority
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/money-and-tax/personal-
finance/pensions/the-pensions-authority/) .

The rules for auto-enrolment are set out in the [ Automatic Enrolment
Retirement Savings System Act 2024
](https://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2024/act/20/enacted/en/pdf) .

##  Who will be automatically enrolled?

You will be automatically enrolled in the new pension scheme if you are an
employee and:

  * You are age between 23 and 60 
  * You are not currently part of a pension plan 
  * You earn €20,000 or more per year 

If you previously contributed to a pension but don’t anymore, and you meet the
other conditions, you will be automatically enrolled.

If you earn less than €20,000 per year, or you are not age between 23 and 60,
you can choose to join the pension scheme if you are not already part of a
pension plan.

###  **Does my employer have to participate?**

If your employer does not meet their [ auto-enrolment obligations
](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/576ac-automatic-enrolment-process-for-
pensions/?section=what-auto-enrolment-scheme-means-for-employers) , they will
be subject to penalties and possibly to prosecution. If they don’t make
contributions on your behalf, they may be fined and have to make repayments
with interest.

However, there are no plans to force employers to contribute to personal
pensions.

###  **What happens if I already have a workplace pension?**

You will not be enrolled in the new auto-enrolment scheme if you are paying
into a workplace pension plan. You can read more about [ occupational pensions
on our website ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/money-and-tax/personal-
finance/pensions/occupational-pensions/) .

###  What happens if I change jobs after being enrolled?

If you change jobs after being automatically enrolled, you won’t need to
change pension or join a new scheme. You will remain a member of the auto-
enrolment scheme on a ‘pot-follows-the-member’ basis. You won’t have to do
anything, as the new National Automatic Enrolment Retirement Savings Authority
will manage the change.

###  Is auto-enrolment better than my personal pension?

Whether auto-enrolment or your personal pension is better for you depends on
your situation and circumstances.

You should review your personal pension and compare it with the benefits of
auto-enrolment to see what works best for you.

For guidance on how pensions work, you can visit a [ Citizens Information
Centre ](https://centres.citizensinformation.ie/) , or call the Citizens
Information Phone Service on 0818 07 4000.

##  Can I leave (opt-out of) the pension scheme?

After you are enrolled, you must stay in the pension scheme for at least 6
months. If you opt-out 6 months after you have been enrolled, your
contributions will be refunded.

###  Opting out after a change in contribution rates

If you choose to leave the scheme in month 7 or 8 after a change in
contribution rates, you will get a refund.

This refund will be based on the difference between your own contributions at
the old and new rates during the previous 6 months.

This option is only available during the first 10 years of the auto-enrolment
scheme, as contribution rates gradually increase (see ‘How much do I pay?’
below). There will be 3 contribution rate changes.

###  Suspending your contributions

You can also suspend your contributions at any time. In this case, you will
not get a refund.

###  What happens to my savings if I opt-out?

Contributions that are not refunded, including those made by your employer and
the Government, stay in your savings pot and will continue to be invested.

If you stop working or move abroad at any time before retirement, you will
stay enrolled, but you will not make additional contributions. Your existing
savings will continue to be invested.

This means you can still access a pension pot at retirement.

###  Automatically re-enrolled after 2 years

If you leave the plan or suspend your contributions, you will be automatically
re-enrolled after 2 years if you are still eligible for the scheme. However,
if you have an alternative pension plan, you won’t be re-enrolled.

You can rejoin the plan at any time before the 2 years pass.

##  How much do I pay?

The amount you pay will be a set rate of your annual salary. Your employer
will match your contributions, and the Government will contribute an
additional amount. You cannot pay more or less than the set rate.

You and your employer will pay 1.5% of your annual salary in the first year.
This will increase to 6% by year 10.

The table below sets out the rates you, your employer, and the Government will
pay:

**Year of the auto-enrolment scheme** **  
** |  **Employee Contribution Rate** |  **Employer pays** **  
** |  **Government pays** **  
**  
---|---|---|---  
1 to 3  |  1.5%  |  1.5%  |  0.5%   
4 to 6  |  3%  |  3%  |  1%   
7 to 9  |  4.5%  |  4.5%  |  1.5%   
10 and after  |  6%  |  6%  |  2%   
  
###  Example

The table below includes an example of a worker earning €20,000 a year:

**Year of the auto-enrolment scheme** |  **Employee pays** |  **Employer pays** |  **Government pays** |  **Total payments per year**  
---|---|---|---|---  
1 to 3  |  €300  |  €300  |  €100  |  €700   
4 to 6  |  €600  |  €600  |  €200  |  €1,400   
7 to 9  |  €900  |  €900  |  €300  |  €2,100   
10 and after  |  €1,200  |  €1,200  |  €400  |  €2,800   
  
###  **What is the maximum contribution?**

For every €3 that you contribute to your pension fund, your employer will put
in €3, and the Government will put in €1. This means that for every €3 you
contribute, €7 will be added to your account.

Both an employer’s and the Government’s contributions are capped at €80,000
gross annual salary.

This means for the first 3 years, the maximum amount an employer can
contribute is €1,200 a year. This is because 1.5% of €80,000 is €1,200. The
maximum amount the Government can contribute is €400 a year, which is 0.5% of
€80,000.

If you earn over €80,000, you can still contribute but your employer or the
Government won't match your contributions on any income over €80,000.
