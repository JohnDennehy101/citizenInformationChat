EU citizens have rights that are set out in the [ EU treaties
](/en/government-in-ireland/european-government/eu-law/how-eu-law-works/) and
the [ EU Charter of Fundamental Rights ](/en/government-in-ireland/european-
government/eu-law/charter-of-fundamental-rights/) .

This page has information about organisations you can contact to get
information or lodge a complaint if you think your EU rights have not been
upheld.

Contact details for the institutions listed below are in the ‘Contacts’
section.

##  Information on EU rights

###  Europe Direct

If you have questions about your rights as a European Union (EU) citizen, [
Europe Direct ](http://europa.eu/europedirect/index_en.htm) provides a free
telephone and email service that acts as a first point of contact. It offers
information on many EU topics and can refer users to the best source of advice
at EU, national, regional and local levels.

[ Europe Direct services in Ireland
](https://www.librariesireland.ie/services/europe-direct) are provided through
Libraries Ireland.

###  Your Europe Advice

[ Your Europe Advice ](http://europa.eu/youreurope/advice/index_en.htm) is a
team of independent legal experts that provides free advice on your rights in
the EU. It can clarify if EU law applies in your case and explain how you can
exercise your EU rights. You can [ submit your query through a web form
](http://europa.eu/youreurope/advice/enquiry_en.htm) .

You can also make an appointment for a consultation with a [ Your Europe Legal
Adviser
](http://ec.europa.eu/ireland/%C2%ADservices/%C2%ADother-%C2%ADeu-%C2%ADservices_en)
through the European Commission Representation in Ireland.

##  Complaints about Irish state bodies

###  European Commission

If you consider that there is a breach of EU law by the Irish authorities, you
may [ make a formal complaint ](http://ec.europa.eu/atwork/applying-eu-
law/make_a_complaint_en.htm) to the [ European Commission ](/en/government-in-
ireland/european-government/eu-institutions/european-commission/) . The
Commission will investigate your complaint and if your complaint is upheld,
may ask the Government to ensure that your rights are respected or may take
the Government to the [ European Court of Justice ](/en/government-in-
ireland/european-government/eu-institutions/european-court-of-justice/) .

###  SOLVIT

[ SOLVIT ](/en/government-in-ireland/european-government/eu-law/solvit/) is a
free service that can help EU citizens and businesses who are facing obstacles
to having their EU rights recognised by public authorities in another country
in the EU.

SOLVIT works as part of the national Government of each member state, so there
is a [ network of SOLVIT centres
](http://ec.europa.eu/solvit/contact/index_en.htm) across the EU.

##  Complaints about businesses

###  Consumer protection organisations

Many of [ your rights as a consumer ](/en/consumer/consumer-laws/your-
consumer-rights/) in Ireland come from EU law. These rights are enforced by [
consumer protection bodies ](/en/consumer/how-to-complain/consumer-protection-
organisations/) in Ireland.

If you have a consumer complaint about a company that is based in another EU
country, you can contact the [ European Consumer Centre
](https://www.eccireland.ie/) .

###  Financial services

FIN-NET is a network of national organisations responsible for settling
consumers' complaints in the area of financial services out of court.

The Irish Fin-Net member organisation is the [ Financial Services and Pensions
Ombudsman ](https://www.fspo.ie/) .

##  Data protection

Your data is protected under the [ General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR)
](/en/government-in-ireland/data-protection/overview-of-general-data-
protection-regulation/) . You can [ access the personal data ](/en/government-
in-ireland/data-protection/rights-under-general-data-protection-regulation/)
that is held on you by businesses, organisations and state bodies. How your
personal data is [ stored and protected ](/en/government-in-ireland/data-
protection/controlling-and-processing-personal-data/) is set out in law.

If you have a complaint about how your personal data is stored or processed,
you should contact the [ Data Protection Commission
](https://www.dataprotection.ie/) .

The [ European Data Protection Supervisor (EDPS) ](https://edps.europa.eu/_en)
is responsible for monitoring the processing of personal data by EU
institutions and bodies. If you are unhappy with how an EU institution or body
has stored or processed your data, you can [ lodge a complaint with the EDPS
](https://secure.edps.europa.eu/EDPSWEB/edps/Supervision/Complaints) .

##  Complaints about EU bodies

###  European Commission Code of Good Behaviour for relations with the public

The Commission has a [ Code of Good Administrative Behaviour
](https://ec.europa.eu/info/about-european-commission/service-standards-and-
principles/ethics-and-good-administration/good-administration/code-good-
administrative-behaviour-and-complaints_en) for its relations with the public.
It is legally binding on the Commission as an institution and on individual
staff of the Commission. If you feel the Commission has failed to comply with
this code you can [ submit a complaint to the Commission electronically or by
post ](http://ec.europa.eu/transparency/code/index_en.htm) .

###  The European Ombudsman

The [ European Ombudsman ](/en/government-in-ireland/european-government/eu-
institutions/european-ombudsman/) examines complaints about maladministration
(for example, unnecessary delay) by EU institutions.

###  European Parliament Petitions Committee

The [ European Parliament ](/en/government-in-ireland/european-government/eu-
institutions/european-parliament/) has a Petitions Committee, which hears [
complaints from citizens about matters related to the EU
](http://ec.europa.eu/justice/citizen/complaints/petition/index_en.htm) . It
does not have the power to implement its decisions but it is influential. A [
petition may be written or submitted online
](https://petiport.secure.europarl.europa.eu/petitions/en/home) .

###  The Court of Justice of the European Union

The [ Court of Justice of the European Union ](/en/government-in-
