  * Your PPS number 
  * An address - when you register, you can state that you have ‘no fixed address’. But you will need to tell your local authority the area where you live and spend most of your time. This will affect where you vote.

you will need to provide an address or Eircode – see ‘How to get an address
for voting’ below.

###  PPS number

You have to provide a [ PPS number
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-
system/personal-public-service-number/#e8434d) when you register to vote.

(ERF 2) ](https://www.checktheregister.ie/en-IE/forms) and identity witnessed
at a local Garda station. You should bring your ID with you.

When you register to vote, you can state that you have ‘no fixed address’.

You can get an address and Eircode to register to vote using [ the free An
Post Address Point service ](https://www.anpost.com/AddressPoint) . You don’t
have to be in Dublin to use this services.

If you have no address, your local authority will contact you to arrange for
you to collect your polling card at one of their offices.

##  How to get your polling card

You need to [ bring ID to vote
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/government-in-ireland/elections-and-
referenda/voting/voting-procedure-in-a-general-election/#35fb3c) **even if**
you have a polling card.

If you have no address where you can receive post, your local authority will
contact you to arrange for you to collect your polling card at one of their
offices.

If you used an address or Eircode to register then your polling card will be
sent to that address.

If you did not get a polling card, you can find your polling station on your [
local authority’s website ](https://www.housing.gov.ie/local-
government/administration/local-authorities/local-authorities) .

##  Updating your details

You can update your details online at [ checktheregister.ie
](https://www.checktheregister.ie/en-IE/forms) .

If you are homeless, you can also use the [ paper form ERF 2
](https://checktheregister.ie/en-IE/forms) to update your details.

Your PPS number and date of birth will not be published on the electoral
register.

##  I don't want my details made public

The Register of Electors is a public document. However, your PPS number and
your date of birth will **not** be published.

you in danger, you can [ apply to be an anonymous elector with form PV7
