##  Introduction

Like many Irish people living abroad, you may decide to move home because you
want your children to grow up in Ireland. You may want them to be educated in
Ireland, or simply be closer to grandparents and extended family.

This page outlines the supports and services you may need when returning to
Ireland with children.

If you need to get an Irish passport for your child, read our page [ Irish
citizenship and passports for children born abroad
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/returning-to-ireland/residency-and-
citizenship/irish-citizenship-and-passports-for-children-born-abroad/) .

If you have a baby after returning to live in Ireland, you can read [
Returning to Ireland and having a baby
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/returning-to-ireland/coming-home-with-
children/returning-to-ireland-and-having-a-baby/) .

##  Accessing childcare, school and college

###  **Childcare**

There is a range of [ childcare options
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/education/pre-school-education-and-
childcare/your-childcare-options/) for pre-school children.

If your child is over 2 years and 8 months when you return, they may be
eligible for free pre-school hours provided through the [ Early Childhood Care
and Education (ECCE) Scheme
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/education/pre-school-education-and-
childcare/early-childhood-care-and-education-scheme/) .

###  **School**

If you have children of school-going age, you may need to [ enrol your child
in primary school ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/returning-to-
ireland/education-and-schooling/enrolling-your-child-in-a-primary-school-
after-returning-to-ireland/) or [ secondary (post-primary) school
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/returning-to-ireland/education-and-
schooling/enrolling-your-child-in-a-secondary-school-after-returning-to-
ireland/) .

education/going-to-primary-school/primary-school-transport-scheme/) .

School transport for post-primary students
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/education/primary-and-post-primary-
education/going-to-post-primary-school/post-primary-school-transport-scheme/)
.

In Ireland, children with special educational needs may attend:

field trips, or tuition fees if they do not qualify for the Free Fees Scheme.

##  Caring for a child with a disability
