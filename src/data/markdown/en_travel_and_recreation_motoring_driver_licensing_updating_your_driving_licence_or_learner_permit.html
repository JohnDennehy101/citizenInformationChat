#  Updating your personal details on your driving licence or learner permit

  * Introduction 
  * How to apply 
  * Documentary evidence 
  * Where to apply 

##  Introduction

When you apply for a driving licence or learner permit, it is issued in the
name and address you provided at that time. If you later change your name or
address, you can exchange your current licence or permit for an updated one.

You need to provide documents that prove the change. Your new licence or
permit will have the same expiry date as your original licence or permit.

There is no charge for changing your name or address (personal details). If
your driving licence is due for renewal or has been lost, stolen or damaged, a
fee will apply. If you are 70 years or over, you are exempt from paying the
fee.

###  Law on having personal details up-to-date on your licence

You must always carry your driving licence or learner permit with you when
driving. You are not required by law to change your licence or permit if you
change your name or address. However, it is advisable.

When driving, you are required to show evidence of your licence or permit if
requested by An Garda Síochána, so your licence or permit should contain up-
to-date information.

##  How to apply

You can [ apply online ](https://www.ndls.ie/licensed-driver/update-my-
personal-details.html) or in person in one of the NDLS centres. You do not
have to provide photographs with your application. You do need to bring
additional documents with you to confirm your identity.

###  Applying online

You need the following:

  * Proof of your [ personal public services number (PPSN) ](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/personal-public-service-number/) and a verified [ MyGovID. ](https://www.mygovid.ie/en-IE/HowDoISignUp)
  * Proof of your address dated within the last 6 months if your current address differs from the one you provided when you applied for your PSC. 
  * A Driving Licence Medical Report Form may be required (see below). 
  * Proof that you are normally resident in Ireland if your place of birth and nationality are outside of the EU/EEA (see below). 
  * There is no fee for making an application to amend personal details unless your driving licence is also due for renewal or has been lost, stolen or damaged, in which case a fee will apply. If you are aged 70 years or over you are exempt from paying the fee. 

###  Applying in person

You must [ book an appointment ](https://www.ndls.ie/booking-service.html) to
attend an [ NDLS centre ](https://www.ndls.ie/how-to-apply/applying-in-
person.html#centre-locations) . You will need to bring the required supporting
documents and ID. An application form is no longer needed. Your photograph and
signature will be captured electronically at the NDLS centre.

You must bring the following with you:

  * Your current or most recent driving licence or learner permit. If your licence has been lost, stolen or damaged, you must bring a [ valid photo ID ](https://www.ndls.ie/how-to-apply/applying-in-person.html#photo-id) with you 
  * Documentary evidence of change of name or address (see below) 
  * Proof of your [ Personal Public Services ](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/personal-public-service-number/) number (PPSN) (see below) 
  * Proof that you are normally resident in Ireland if your place of birth and nationality are outside of the EU/EEA (see below)
