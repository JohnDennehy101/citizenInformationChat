##  Introduction

Becoming a carer can happen at any stage in life. If you are an Irish citizen
living abroad and need to return to Ireland to care for a family member, or
you are returning with a family member you are caring for, there are supports
and services available in Ireland.

If you are returning with family member from outside the EEA, the UK or
Switzerland, they will need [ permission to live in Ireland
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/returning_to_ireland/residency_and_citizenship/)
.

The Health Service Executive (HSE) delivers public health services in Ireland.
You must be [ ordinarily resident
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/health/health-system/entitlement-to-
public-health-services/#la6e34) in Ireland to access most HSE services at a
free or reduced rate.

This page includes information on how to access community and home care
services, tax and social welfare payments for carers and how to apply for
financial support for nursing home care.

##  Caring for an older family member

If you are returning to Ireland to care for an older family member such as a
parent, there are health services and schemes available to help.

Your [ Local Health Office ](https://www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/1/lho/) ,
your GP or Public Health Nurse can help to access [ community care services
](/en/health/health-services/care-in-your-community/community-care-services/)
in your area, such as [ physiotherapy ](/en/health/health-services/care-in-
your-community/physiotherapy-services/) , respite care and Home Support
Services.

###  Home Support Service

The [ Home Support Service ](/en/health/health-services/health-services-for-
older-people/home-support-service/) provides help and support with everyday
tasks to people aged 65 or over living at home. In some cases, people under 65
can access this service, for example, people with early onset dementia or a
disability. The Home Support Service is free of charge and run by the HSE.

Depending on where you live, there may be a waiting list for home support
services.

####  Applying from a hospital

If the person you are caring for is in hospital, they should ask the person
dealing with their discharge plan for a Home Support Application Form. This
person might be a nurse, a discharge coordinator or a social worker. They will
help them to complete the application form and send it to their local HSE Home
Support Office.

The HSE will then arrange a care needs assessment to see what support your
family member needs.

They should apply as soon as possible during their hospital stay to avoid
delays in their discharge home from hospital.

####  Applying from home

If the person you are caring for is living at home, they can apply for home
support services themselves by sending a completed application form to their
local HSE Home Support Office. You can find the [ application form at the end
of the Home Support Information Booklet (pdf) ](https://www.hse.ie/eng/home-
support-services/apply-for-home-supports-services/home-support-services-
information-booklet-and-application-form-2018.pdf) .

If they are unable to apply themselves, someone can apply for them. This can
be their relative, family carer, GP or public health nurse. After the HSE
receives the completed application form, they will arrange a care needs
assessment.

Contact your [ local Home Support Office ](https://www.hse.ie/eng/home-
support-services/contact-your-local-home-support-office/) if you have any
questions about your application.

###  Care needs assessment

The person you are caring for will need to complete a care needs assessment to
access many public health services. The assessment looks at a person’s ability
to look after themselves safely, for example:

  * Personal hygiene 
  * Movement 
  * Preparing meals 
  * Cleaning and caring for their home 

They will then get a care plan which says what HSE services they need.

###  Nursing home care

If your family member needs nursing home care, they need to choose a nursing
home that meets their needs. You can find a [ list of registered nursing homes
](https://www.hiqa.ie/areas-we-work/find-a-centre/map) on the HIQA website.
The HSE also has a [ guide to choosing a nursing home (pdf)
](https://www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/4/olderpeople/residentialcare/nursinghomechecklist.pdf)
.

If they need help paying for nursing home care, they can apply to the Nursing
Home Support Scheme, also known as the [ Fair deal scheme ](/en/health/health-
services/health-services-for-older-people/fair-deal-scheme/) . Under Fair
Deal, they pay a certain amount towards the cost of their care and the HSE
pays the rest. Fair Deal covers approved [ private nursing homes, voluntary
nursing homes ](https://www.hse.ie/eng/fair-deal-scheme/choosing-a-nursing-
home/cost-of-voluntary-and-private-nursing-homes.pdf) and [ public nursing
homes ](https://www.hse.ie/eng/fair-deal-scheme/choosing-a-nursing-home/cost-
of-care-in-public-nursing-homes-2018.pdf) .

They must be ordinarily resident in Ireland to qualify for the Fair Deal
scheme. If the person who needs nursing home care has not yet returned to
Ireland, [ contact Safe Home Ireland ](https://safehomeireland.com/contact-
us-2/) for information on applying for the Fair Deal scheme.

If they choose to pay for nursing home care privately, they must pay the full
cost of the private nursing home directly.

###  Helping someone apply for the Fair Deal scheme

If you are helping someone with reduced decision-making capacity to apply for
Fair Deal scheme, you need to be a [ specified person
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/health/health-services/health-
services-for-older-people/fair-deal-scheme/#b172e8) . A specified person can
apply on behalf of a person needing care if they are unable to apply
themselves.

##  Caring for a child with a disability

If your child has a disability, or you think they may have a disability, you
should meet with your family doctor when you return to Ireland, (also known as
a GP) or a public health nurse. They can help you to access the services your
child needs. You can also [ make a referral yourself
](https://www2.hse.ie/services/disability-support-and-services/childrens-
disability-services/get-a-referral-for-childrens-disability-
services.html#referral) .

Read more information about [ caring for a child with a disability in Ireland
](/en/health/health-services/children-s-health/caring-for-a-child-with-a-
disability/) .

Before returning to Ireland, ask your doctor for a copy of your child’s
medical records, prescriptions for drugs and medicines and immunisation
records. If you have been seeing a consultant or specialist in a hospital
abroad, you should get a copy of your records sent to your GP in Ireland.

If you are not registered with a GP in Ireland, you can have these records
transferred to your GP when you register with one.

###  Registering with a GP

You can [ find a GP in your local area ](https://www2.hse.ie/services/find-a-
gp/) on the HSE website. Sometimes GP practices have a full list of patients
and cannot take on new patients. In this case, you should go to another GP
practice in your area. You can transfer to the GP of your first choice at a
later date if they start taking on new patients again.

Some GPs provide services only to private patients. You usually have to pay to
see a GP as a private patient and fees can vary. You can see a GP free of
charge if you have a [ medical card or a GP visit card
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/health/medical_cards_and_gp_visit_cards/)
.

You do not need a PPS number or other documentation to visit a GP.

##  Can I get a carer’s payment when I return to Ireland?

If you are returning to Ireland and caring for someone, you may be able to
claim a social welfare payment. You must be [ habitually resident
](/en/returning-to-ireland/applying-for-social-welfare/habitual-residence-
condition/) in Ireland to qualify for Carer’s Allowance.

The 2 main social welfare payments for carers providing full-time care are [
Carer’s Allowance ](/en/social-welfare/carers/carers-allowance/) and [ Carer’s
Benefit ](/en/social-welfare/carers/carers-benefit/) .

###  Carer’s Allowance

Carer’s Allowance is a means tested payment for people who are caring for a
person who needs support because of their age, disability or illness. You must
be habitually resident to qualify for this payment.

###  Carer’s Benefit

Carer’s Benefit is a payment for people who leave work or reduce their hours
to care for a person in need of full-time care. You must be under 66 and have
paid enough [ social insurance (PRSI) contributions ](/en/social-
welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/social-insurance-prsi/paying-social-
insurance/) .

If you paid social insurance in another EU member state or the UK, this may be
used to meet the contribution rules for Carer’s Benefit. But your most recent
social insurance contribution must be paid in Ireland.

###  Other supports

You may qualify for an annual [ Carer's Support Grant ](/en/social-
welfare/carers/carers-support-grant/) . This payment is not means tested and
you do not need to meet the habitual residence condition to qualify. You must
provide care for at least 6 months to qualify for this payment, and this
period must include the first Thursday in June.

If your child is aged under 16 and has a severe disability, you may qualify
for [ Domiciliary Care Allowance (DCA) ](/en/social-welfare/disability-and-
illness/domiciliary-care-allowance/) . The child must need ongoing care and
attention, substantially more than is usually needed by a child of the same
age. It is not means tested.

You may also qualify for the [ Household Benefits Package ](/en/social-
welfare/extra-social-welfare-benefits/household-benefits-package/) (if you are
living with the person you are caring for) and [ free travel ](/en/social-
welfare/extra-social-welfare-benefits/free-travel/) . Read more about [
carer’s payments in Ireland
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/carers/)
.

##  Tax credits and reliefs

Tax credits reduce the amount of income tax you pay. Tax reliefs reduce the
amount of income on which you pay income tax.

You can claim [ tax relief on medical expenses ](/en/money-and-tax/tax/income-
tax-credits-and-reliefs/taxation-and-medical-expenses/) and there are a number
of [ tax credits and reliefs for people with disabilities
](http://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/money_and_tax/tax/tax_credits_and_reliefs_for_people_with_disabilities/)
. There are also [ social welfare benefits for people who are sick or have a
disability ](/en/social-welfare/disability-and-illness/benefits-to-people-who-
are-sick-or-have-a-disability/) .

##  Further information and useful contacts

Your [ Local Health Office ](https://www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/1/lho/) or
Public Health Nurse can help you to access public health services in your
