##  What is chiropody and podiatry?

If you have problems with your feet or lower limbs, a chiropodist is a health
professional that can examine, diagnose and treat any diseases or
abnormalities your feet may have.

Chiropodists can also help alleviate painful symptoms and improve mobility.

Chiropodists are also often known as podiatrists.

If you need chiropody services, you may be referred to a chiropodist by your
GP or local [ public health nurse
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/health/health-services/care-in-your-
community/public-health-nurses/) . You can also contact chiropodists directly.

##  How to get chiropody services in Ireland

The availability of chiropody services from the Health Service Executive (HSE)
can depend on the area you live in. Chiropody services may be provided by the
[ Local Health Office ](https://www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/1/lho/) or by
voluntary organisations on behalf of the HSE.

Contact your GP, public health nurse or [ Local Health Office
](https://www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/1/lho/) for information on chiropody
services in your area.

##  Can I get chiropody services?

If chiropody is available in your area from the HSE, you will usually get
priority if you have:

  * A [ medical card ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/health/medical-cards-and-gp-visit-cards/medical-card/) and are aged 66 and over 
  * A [ Health Amendment Act card ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/health/health-services/blood-and-organ-donation/hepatitis-c-and-health-amendment-act-cards/)
  * An illness such as diabetes or arthritis 
  * A disability 

##  Chiropody treatment card

In some areas you can apply for a chiropody treatment card if you have a [
medical card ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/health/medical-cards-and-
gp-visit-cards/medical-card/) , and you are:

  * Aged over 65 years or 
  * Living with Diabetes 

You can check if this is available in your area and get an application form
from your [ Local Health Office ](https://www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/1/lho/)
.

###  Tax relief and chiropody services

You may be able to claim tax relief on medical expenses if you pay for
chiropody services. You can also claim tax relief on doctor visits and
prescription drugs.

##  Chiropodist and podiatrist organisations

There are currently 3 separate professional bodies representing chiropodists:

  * [ The Society of Chiropodists and Podiatrists of Ireland ](http://www.podiatryireland.com)
  * [ Irish Chiropodists/Podiatrists Organisation Ltd ](http://chiropodypodiatryireland.ie/)
  * [ Institute of Chiropodists and Podiatrists ](http://www.iocp.org.uk/)

You can ask them to check whether your chiropodist is registered as a member.

[ CORU, the Health and Social Care Professionals Council
](http://www.coru.ie/) , is the organisation that will register and regulate
podiatrists.
