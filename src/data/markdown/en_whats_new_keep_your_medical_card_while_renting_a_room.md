#  Keep your medical card while renting a room

9 September 2024

#####  News

  

If you rent a room in your home under the [ rent a room scheme
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/housing/owning-a-home/home-
owners/renting-a-room-in-your-home/) , you can get up to €14,000 of rent a
year disregarded in the means test for the medical card or the GP visit card.

You must rent the room to a private renter and your rental income must not be
more than €14,000.

This means that up to €14,000 income you receive from renting a room will not
be considered when your income is assessed to check if you qualify for the
medical card or the GP visit card.
