##  Introduction

There are 2 types of referendum in Ireland – a constitutional referendum and
an ordinary referendum.

**Constitutional referendum**

[ Bunreacht na hÉireann
](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/d5bd8c-constitution-of-
ireland/?referrer=http://www.taoiseach.gov.ie/eng/Historical_Information/The_Constitution/)
is the basic law or [ Constitution ](/en/government-in-ireland/irish-
constitution-1/constitution-introduction/) of Ireland. It was enacted in 1937
and has been amended several times.

The Constitution can only be amended if the proposed amendment has been
approved by the people of Ireland in a referendum. This gives the people the
opportunity to decide whether or not the law will change.

As of 2021, 38 constitutional referendums had been held and 32 have been
approved. They are [ listed on taoiseach.gov.ie
](http://www.taoiseach.gov.ie/eng/Historical_Information/The_Constitution/) .
You can read [ reports and recommendations relating to several previous
referendums. ](http://www.refcom.ie/previous-referendums/)

**Ordinary referendum**

An ordinary referendum does not relate to amending the Constitution. An
ordinary referendum would be held if the President decided that a Bill
contained a proposal of such national importance that the will of the people
should decide its outcome.

##  Constitutional referendum

[ Article 46 of the Constitution
](https://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/cons/en/html#part15) sets out the rules
for how the Constitution can be amended. [ Article 47
](https://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/cons/en/html#part16) sets out the basic
rules for referendums. A body of legislation, including a series of Referendum
Acts, governs how they operate.

For a constitutional referendum, a Bill is first introduced in the [ Dáil
](/en/government-in-ireland/houses-of-the-oireachtas/dail-eireann/) , setting
out the wording of the proposed amendment. If both the Dáil and the [ Seanad
](/en/government-in-ireland/houses-of-the-oireachtas/the-seanad/) pass the
Bill, the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage makes an order
specifying the polling day for the referendum.

##  Ordinary referendum

An ordinary referendum is one that does not relate to amending [ Bunreacht na
hÉireann (the Irish Constitution) ](/en/government-in-ireland/irish-
constitution-1/constitution-introduction/) . To date no ordinary referendum
has ever been held.

An ordinary referendum would take place if the [ President ](/en/government-
in-ireland/houses-of-the-oireachtas/president-introduction-to-the-president-
of-ireland/) received a joint petition from both houses of the [ Oireachtas
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/government_in_ireland/houses_of_the_oireachtas/)
. The petition would say that a proposed Bill was of such national importance
that the people of Ireland should decide whether it became law.

The joint petition must be passed by the majority of the members of the [
Seanad ](/en/government-in-ireland/houses-of-the-oireachtas/the-seanad/) and
one-third of the members of the [ Dáil ](/en/government-in-ireland/houses-of-
the-oireachtas/dail-eireann/) . When the President receives the petition, they
must consult the [ Council of State ](https://president.ie/en/the-
president/council-of-state) . If the President agrees that the proposal is of
such national importance they will refuse to sign the Bill until a referendum
has been held.

The referendum must be held within 18 months of the President's decision not
to sign the Bill.

##  Electoral Commission

The [ Electoral Commission ](/en/government-in-ireland/elections-and-
referenda/voting/electoral-commission/) took over the functions of the
Referendum Commission in February 2023.

The Electoral Commission oversees elections and referendums. It also explains
the subject matter of the referendum proposal, to promote public awareness of
the referendum and to encourage people to vote.

###  Work of the Electoral Commission

The Electoral Commission’s role in referendums is to prepare impartial and
unbiased information about the referendum proposal and make that information
available to the public.

It prepares statements on the main issues and distributes those statements
through television, radio and other forms of media to bring them to the
attention of the public. The role of the Commission includes ensuring that the
statements are accessible for those with a sight or hearing disability.

##  Voting

All Irish citizens who are on the Register of Electors, the Postal Voters List
or the Special Voters List can [ vote in a referendum. ](/en/government-in-
ireland/elections-and-referenda/voting/right-to-vote/)

Voting is by secret ballot. The title of the proposed bill will be printed on
the ballot and the voter will mark “Yes” or “No”. There are various [
arrangements to facilitate voters with disabilities. ](/en/government-in-
ireland/elections-and-referenda/voting/facilities-for-voters-with-
disabilities/) A tactile ballot paper template is available in each polling
station for people who are visually impaired.

##  Results

The day after the poll, the votes for and against the referendum proposal are
counted and the Local Returning Officer reports the result to the Referendum
Returning Officer. The counting may be watched by members of the Oireachtas
and [ approved bodies ](https://www.refcom.ie/the-commission/approved-bodies/)
.

When the results from all constituencies have been counted, the Referendum
Returning Officer draws up a provisional referendum certificate. This states
the overall result of the voting and if the proposed amendment has been
approved, which requires more than 50% of the votes to be “Yes.” The
provisional certificate is published in [ Iris Oifigiúil (the State Gazette)
](http://www.irisoifigiuil.ie/) .

The voting procedure at the ordinary referendum is the same as in a
constitutional referendum except that bill is rejected by the people if:

  * The majority of the votes cast are against the Bill and 
  * Those votes make up at least one-third of the presidential electors on the register of electors. 

If a voter wants to challenge the provisional certificate, they must present a
petition to the High Court within 7 days of the publication of the provisional
certificate. If no petition is presented to the High Court, the certificate
becomes final.

##  Amending the Constitution

If the final certificate shows that the majority of the votes cast were in
favour of the proposal to amend the Constitution, the [ President
](../../the_president/president_introduction_to_the_president_of_ireland.en.html)
signs the Bill and the Constitution is amended.
