##  Introduction

Ireland uses penalty points to enforce the [ rules of the road
](https://www.rsa.ie/services/learner-drivers/resources/rules-of-the-road) and
improve road safety. If you commit a [ motoring offence ](/en/travel-and-
recreation/motoring/driving-offences/driving-offences/) , and the penalty for
the offence includes penalty points, your driving licence will be endorsed
with one or more penalty points.

Some traffic offences have other penalties, such as fines as well as penalty
points.

The penalty points system for driving offences has operated in Ireland since
2002. The law governing penalty points is the [ Road Traffic Act 2002
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2002/en/act/pub/0012/index.html) . This
legislation has been amended a number of times to add offences for which
penalty points can be issued.

While penalty points are endorsed on your driving licence, the points do not
physically appear on the licence. Your penalty points are recorded on your
driving licence record, which is held on the National Vehicle and Driver File
operated by the Department of Transport.

Penalty point endorsements remain on your licence record for 3 years and must
be notified to your insurance company when applying for motor insurance. Motor
insurance companies have had access to the National Vehicle and Driver File
since 2014.

Endorsements on your licence record will often lead to an increase in your
motor insurance premium.

##  How do penalty points work?

Penalty points are recorded on your driving licence when:

  * You are convicted in court of a driving offence that attracts penalty points or 
  * You pay a [ fixed charge notice ](/en/travel-and-recreation/motoring/driving-offences/driving-offences/) that was issued to you for an offence that also carries penalty points 

If you get 12 penalty points in any 3 year period, you are automatically
disqualified from driving for 6 months.

**Learner permit** drivers are disqualified if they have 7 penalty points.
This lower threshold also applies for the first 2 years of a driver’s first
full driving licence.

Penalty points are not added to your licence immediately.

####  Fixed charge and penalty offences

Fixed notice penalties are issued for driving offences that attract penalty
points and/or just a fine.

If you receive a fixed notice penalty, you will be issued a notice by the
Department of Transport. If you pay the fixed charge fine within 56 days, you
will get a further notice from the Department of Transport confirming that the
penalty points will be added to your driving licence. The penalty points will
be added to your licence 28 days after that.

If you do not pay the fixed charge fine within 56 days, you will get a summons
to appear in the District Court. If you are convicted of a driving offence in
court, the court will notify the Department of Transport of the number of
penalty points attached to that conviction. The Department of Transport will
then issue a notification that these penalty points will be added to your
driving licence 28 days after the notification date.

You can get information on fixed charge notices and fines in our [ document on
driving offences ](/en/travel-and-recreation/motoring/driving-
offences/driving-offences/) .

##  How long do penalty points stay on my licence?

Penalty points remain on your licence record for 3 years. Any period where
your licence is out of date or you are serving a court disqualification does
not count as part of the 3 years.

If you accumulate 12 points or 7 where applicable and are disqualified from
driving for 6 months, the points which led to the disqualification are removed
at the end of the 6 months.

But if you had more offences that had not been endorsed on your licence record
by the time you started your 6 month suspension, these extra points would be
added to your licence record and would remain on your licence for 3 years
(from the time your licence was reinstated).

##  What happens to my licence if I have 12 penalty points or 7 where
applicable?

If you have been notified by the Department of Transport that you have been [
disqualified from driving ](/en/travel-and-recreation/motoring/driving-
offences/being-disqualified-from-driving/) because you have reached 12 penalty
points or more, you must surrender your driving licence to the National Driver
Licence Service for the period of 6 months.

##  What motoring offences result in penalty points?

[ The Road Traffic Act 2002, (as amended)
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2002/en/act/pub/0012/index.html) legislates
for motoring offences that incur penalty points. The Road Safety Authority
maintains an [ up-to-date list of penalty point motoring offences.
](https://www.rsa.ie/en/RSA/Licensed-Drivers/Penalty-points/Types-of-
offences/)

Examples of how penalty points and fines are awarded.

**Speeding offences** : A fixed charge fine of €160, together with 3 penalty
points. If you have been caught speeding on a police traffic camera, you will
get a notice of your fine and penalty points for the offence by post. You have
28 days in which to pay your fine from the date the notice is issued to you.
If you do not pay your fine, the fine then increases to €240, which you must
pay within 28 days. If after this time (56 days) you still have not paid your
fine, the offence is referred to the courts. If you are convicted in court of
speeding offences and non-payment of fines, you will automatically receive 5
penalty points and a fine up to a maximum of €1,000.

**Seatbelt offences** : If you drive without a seatbelt or allow children
under 17 years to travel in your car without a seatbelt, you will incur a
fixed charge fine of €120. You must pay this fine within 28 days or face an
increased fine of €180 payable within 56 days of the offence. 3 penalty points
will be added to your licence if you pay the fine on time. If you are
convicted in court for non-wearing of a seatbelt, 5 penalty points will be
added to your licence and you will be liable to a €2,000 fine for a first
offence. [ Read more about seatbelts and the law in Ireland ](/en/travel-and-
recreation/roads-and-safety/seatbelts-when-motoring-in-ireland/) .

**Motor insurance offences** : If you drive without insurance, you will get 5
penalty points and will have to appear in court. The court can issue a fine of
up to €5,000 and can send you to prison for up to 6 months. The court can
disqualify you from driving instead of issuing penalty points.

**Careless driving** : If you drive ‘a vehicle in a public place without due
care and attention' you can get up to 5 penalty points on your licence and a
fine of up to €5,000. If careless driving causes death or serious bodily harm,
you are liable on conviction on indictment to imprisonment for a term of up to
2 years or to a fine of up to €10,000 or to both.

##  Other penalty point questions

###  What happens if someone else was driving my vehicle?

If the driving offence was detected by camera, the notice is sent to the
registered owner of the vehicle. If the registered owner was not driving at
the time of the offence they should fill out the form attached to the notice,
giving details of the person who was actually driving. This should then be
returned to the Fixed Charge Processing Office with the original notice. **Do
not enclose payment** . The Gardaí then issue a notice to the driver.

###  Do penalty points apply to all Irish driving licences?

Yes. Penalty points apply to both learner permits and full Irish driving
licences. Penalty points also apply to drivers with foreign driving licences
driving in Ireland. If someone is driving in Ireland on a foreign licence, a
record will be created for penalty points. If the driver accumulates 12
penalty points in a 3-year period, they are disqualified from driving in
Ireland.

###  How do you find out how many penalty points you have on your driving
licence?

To find out how many penalty points are on your driving licence record,
contact the National Driver Licence Service (NDLS) at 0818 700 800 or email [
info@ndls.ie ](mailto:info@ndls.ie) and quote your driving licence number.

###  Penalty points from other jurisdictions

Penalty points from other countries (including EU/EEA member states and the
United Kingdom) are not recognised between states. Although a European
Convention on driving disqualifications was signed by the member states in
June 1998, it is not currently in force. However, the UK and Ireland have a [
separate agreement ](https://www.rsa.ie/en/RSA/Licensed-Drivers/Driving-
licence/Mutual-recognition-of-Driver-Disqualifications/) that allows each
country to recognise disqualifications (but not penalty points) due to certain
offences.

###  Can penalty points be cancelled?

If you have been issued with penalty points (or a fixed charge without penalty
points), you can apply to the Gardaí for the points to be cancelled. You will
have to show that there are good **procedural** or **exceptional** grounds for
cancellation.

**Procedural grounds** \- examples of this include:

  * A technical problem meant that wrong information was recorded (for example, the wrong speed limit was detected) 
  * You are exempt from the offence, for example, you have an exemption from wearing a seatbelt. See [ our document on seatbelts ](/en/travel-and-recreation/roads-and-safety/seatbelts-when-motoring-in-ireland/) ) 
  * You have been penalised for not having tax or insurance, but you can show that you had motor tax or insurance at the time of the alleged offence 
  * The car had been stolen and you have been sent a fixed charge notice and/or penalty points for offences committed after the theft of the vehicle 
  * You no longer owned the vehicle 

**Exceptional grounds** – examples of this include

  * You broke the speed limit because you were bringing someone to the hospital 
  * You broke the speed limit because you were responding to an emergency in your home (for example, a fire or gas leak) 

You can get the [ Fixed Charge Notice Cancellation Request Form

cancellation-request-form-new.pdf) and [ guidance notes
