##  Income and other taxes

##  Income Tax

###  Restriction of reliefs

The restriction of income tax relief for high income earners* is being amended
for 2010 and subsequent tax years to achieve an effective rate of income tax
of 30% for people who were subject to the full restriction. PRSI and relevant
levies will also apply. The entry level threshold for the restriction will now
occur at adjusted income levels of €125,000 (was €250,000) and the full
restriction will apply at €400,000 (was €500,000).

*This restriction of relief measure was introduced in Budget 2006, and came into operation from 1 January 2007. It limits the use of tax breaks by those with high incomes. It is based on restricting the amount of specified reliefs which a person can use to reduce their tax bill in any one year. 

###  New Irish domicile levy

All Irish nationals and Irish-domiciled people with a worldwide income of over
€1 million and Irish-located capital of over €5 million will pay a new Irish
domicile levy of €200,000. This levy applies regardless of where the person is
tax resident. No date has been set for the introduction of these measures yet.

##  Other Income Tax

###  Mortgage Interest Relief

Qualifying loans taken out before 1 July 2011 will continue to get relief for
7 years. Transitional measures will be provided for qualifying loans taken out
between 1 July 2011 and end 2013.

People whose entitlement to relief is due to expire in 2010 or after, continue
to qualify for relief at the applicable rate up until the end of 2017.

Mortgage Interest Relief will be abolished entirely by the end of 2017.

###  Corporation tax  

The existing scheme providing a three-year exemption from tax on the income
and gains of new start-up companies will be extended to include companies who
commence trading in 2010.

###  Relief from income levy for certain farm expenditure

Relief from the income levy will be allowed for certain expenditure incurred
by farmers to comply with the requirements of the EU Nitrates Directive
91/676/EEC.

###  Announcement on reform of income tax system in 2011

The Minister for Finance announced that a new system of two charges on income
would be introduced in 2011.

A new Universal Social Contribution will replace employee PRSI, the health
levy and the income levy. It will be paid by everyone at a low rate on a wide
base as a collective contribution to public services.

Income tax will apply on a progressive basis to those with higher incomes.

###  Proposed property tax and water charges

The Minister for Finance indicated that work will begin on registration of
ownership and valuation of land in preparation for a site valuation tax. A
system of water metering for homes will also be introduced. Water charges will
be based on consumption above a free allocation. Further details will be
announced by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.

##  Excise Duties

###  Decrease in excise on alcohol

Excise duty is reduced on beer and cider by 12 cent (VAT inclusive) per pint,
on spirits by 14 cent (VAT inclusive) per half glass, and on wine by 60 cent
(VAT inclusive) per 75cl bottle (from midnight, 9 December 2009).

###  Vehicle Registration Tax (VRT)

The following package of measures will be introduced in January 2010:

  * Car Scrappage Scheme 
  * Extension of VRT exemption for Electric Vehicles 
  * Extension of VRT relief scheme for plug-in hybrid electric vehicles 

A Car Scrappage Scheme is being introduced with effect from 1 January 2010, to
run until 31 December 2010. VRT relief of up to €1,500 will be provided where
a car of 10 years or older is scrapped in accordance with certain criteria and
a new car that falls within emissions bands A or B (i.e. with CO2 emissions of
140g/km or less) is purchased.

The existing VRT exemption for series production electric vehicles and the VRT
relief of up to €2,500 for series production plug-in hybrid electric vehicles
(both of which are due to expire on 31 December 2010) are being extended for 2
years until 31 December 2012.

###  New carbon tax

A carbon tax at a rate of €15 per tonne is being introduced on fossil fuels.
The tax will apply to petrol and diesel with effect from midnight, 9 December
2009 and from 1 May 2010 to kerosene, marked gas oil (for agricultural use),
Liquid Petroleum Gas (LPG), fuel oil and natural gas. The application of the
tax to coal and commercial peat is subject to legislation. A vouched fuel
allowance scheme will be introduced to offset the increases for low income
families.

##  Value Added Tax (VAT)

###  Reduction in standard VAT rate

The standard rate of VAT will be reduced from 21.5 to 21 %with effect from 1
January 2010. This decrease will apply to all goods and services which are
currently subject to VAT at 21.5%.

##  Health and tourism

###  Health

The estimate for 2010 includes:

  * An additional €97m for the Fair Deal scheme which, with the €55m provided in 2009, brings the total additional allocation for this scheme to €152m. This will allow for growth in the number of people qualifying for the scheme in line with demographic needs. 
  * An additional €10m for more Home Care Packages, bringing the total provision for this scheme to €130m in 2010, again reflecting increased need. 
  * An extra €230m for demand-led schemes, including additional numbers of medical cards, bringing the total allocation for these schemes to over €3bn in 2010. 
  * An additional €20m to continue implementation of the National Cancer Control Programme, in accordance with clinical priorities. This includes improvements in lung, prostate, rectal and pancreatic cancer and radiotherapy treatment as well as initiation of a colorectal cancer screening programme. Further details about which will be made available in the coming days. 
  * €70m to address various other demographic service needs, the details of which will be finalised as part of the 2010 Health Service Executive (HSE) Service Plan. 
  * €17m to support suitable projects that demonstrate innovation in service delivery. 

###  Hospital charges

There are to be no increases in the statutory charges for Accident &
Emergency, day and in-patient services.

The charges for private beds in public hospitals are not being increased.

###  Drugs Payment Scheme

(Expected implementation date 1 April 2010)

###  Dental treatment

Under the Dental Treatment Services Scheme (DTSS), adult medical card holders
may obtain dental services from dentists in private practice under contract to
the HSE. In 2010, expenditure will be reduced by €30m to the 2008 level of
€63m.

##  Mental health and disability

###  Capital programme

Multi-annual funding for the mental health capital programme is to be provided
from the sale of HSE assets. In 2010 the HSE will invest an initial sum of €43
million in the programme.

The mental health capital programme will provide a range of facilities across
the entire spectrum of mental healthcare facilities including acute
psychiatric units, child and adolescent units, day hospitals, community
nursing units and high support hostels, and will provide the infrastructure
necessary to enable its transformation into a patient-centred, flexible and
community-based mental health service, where the need for hospital admission
is reduced, whilst still providing in-patient care when appropriate.

Provision for continued funding of the programme will be made in the 2011
Estimates and subsequent years, in the light of the previous year’s programme
of asset sales.

###  Innovation funding for disability and mental health

Funding of €3m is to be provided to the Person Centre, a non-profit
organisation which has established a fund to support transition from
institutional to person-centred models of care in disability and mental health
services. The organisation is also funded by Atlantic Philanthropies.

Liquid Petroleum Gas (LPG), fuel oil and natural gas.

The application of the tax to coal and commercial peat is subject to a
Commencement Order. Exemption from the tax will apply only to participants in
the EU Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) in respect of fuels so covered.

###  Car scrappage scheme

A car scrappage scheme is being introduced with effect from 1 January 2010, to
run until 31 December 2010. VRT relief of up to €1,500 will be provided where
a car of 10 years or older is scrapped in accordance with certain criteria and
a new car of emissions bands A or B (CO2 emissions of 140g/km or less) is
purchased.

###  Extension of VRT exemption for electric vehicles

The existing VRT exemption for series production electric vehicles and the VRT
relief of up to €2,500 for series production plug-in hybrid electric vehicles,
which is due to expire on 31 December 2010, is being extended for 2 years
until 31 December 2012. Support will also be provided to offset the initial
battery costs for such cars.

###  Energy efficiency measures

Allocation of about €130m for energy efficiency measures will include a new
multi-annual National Retrofit Programme in 2010.

€50m of the carbon tax yield will be used to fund measures such as help for
households at risk of fuel poverty to make their homes warmer.

The local authorities will receive additional funding to retrofit the social
housing stock.

Extension of the existing capital allowances scheme for energy-efficient
equipment purchased by companies from seven categories of eligible equipment
to ten.

###  Relief from income levy for certain farm expenditure

In excess of €70 million will be provided over the remainder of 2009 and into
2010 to help those affected by recent flooding and to fund work to minimise
the risks of future incidents. The review of investment priorities which will
shortly be published will also provide for continued substantial investment in

##  Housing

###  Mortgage Interest Relief

Qualifying loans taken out before 1 July 2011 will continue to get relief for
7 years. Transitional measures will be provided for qualifying loans taken out
between 1 July 2011 and end 2013.

Government for housing will be reduced. The social housing investment
programme will change its focus from acquisition and construction of housing
towards cheaper methods, such as leasing.

There will be a new multi-annual National Retrofit Programme. It is expected
that this scheme may create up to 5,000 jobs in 2010. The local authorities
will get extra funding to retrofit the social housing stock. It is intended
that over one million homes will have been retrofitted by 2025.

€50m of the yield from the new carbon tax will be used to fund measures such
as helping to make homes warmer for households at risk of fuel poverty.

A vouched fuel allowance scheme will be developed. This will aim to offset the
increased costs generated by the proposed carbon tax for low-income families
who are dependent on certain fuels to heat their homes.

###  Property taxation

Work will shortly begin on the registration of ownership and the valuation of
land, in preparation for the introduction of a site valuation tax.

schools generally to cover teacher absences will be used to cover substitution
in those schools that participated in the scheme.

  * Under the Employer Jobs (PRSI) Incentive Scheme, where an employer creates a new job and takes on a person who has been unemployed for 6 months or more, the employer will be fully exempted from the liability to pay PRSI for the first year of that employment. This will give employers an 8%-10% saving on employment costs for each new job created. Full details will be announced early in 2010. 

###  Allowances

The FÁS Training Allowance to new entrants who are not entitled to Jobseeker’s
Benefit/Allowance will be discontinued.

###  Public Service

###  Salaries

Public service salaries will be reduced as follows:

**Salaries less than €125,00 per year**

  * 5% on the first €30,000 of salary 
  * 7.5% on the next €40,000 of salary 
  * 10% on the next €55,000 of salary 

This produces overall reductions in salaries ranging from 5% to just under 8%
for salaries up to €125,000.

A new single scheme will be introduced for all new entrants to the public
service from 2010 onwards. Main provisions include:

  * Raising of the minimum public service pension age from 65 to 66 years initially, and then to be linked with the State Pension age 
  * Maximum retirement age of 70 years 
  * Pensions to be based on “career average” earnings rather than final salary 

Legislation will be introduced early in 2010 to give effect to these measures.

The Government will consider using the Consumer Price Index (CPI) as the basis
for post-retirement increases for both existing and future pensioners.

For existing public servants retiring after 2010, the Minister may bring
forward further proposals as part of the legislation introducing the single
new scheme.

In developing the new scheme the Government will be considering:

  * Employee pension contribution - the rate of employee pension contribution remains at 6.5% but may apply to all pensionable pay 
  * Pension accrual rate applying to pensionable pay taking account of entitlement to a State Pension 
  * Some groups, such as Gardaí, Defence Forces, prison officers and firefighters will retain early retirement ages but other special terms, such as added years, will be generally discontinued 

These terms to apply to the President, Oireachtas members, the judiciary and
the Attorney General.

Any retirements in 2010 will be on existing pay terms before the reductions
announced in this Budget.  
  

##  National Solidarity Bond

A new National Solidarity Bond is proposed to help the financing of the
capital investment programme underlying the 2010 Budget (that is, the bond
will not be used to fund additional spending).

The bond will be in addition to the current range of “State Savings” products

  * Continued support for communities through local and community development programmes, supports for volunteering, for locally-based community and voluntary groups and the Community Services Programme. 
  * A revised Scheme of Community Support for Older People will be introduced early in 2010, which will provide security equipment for upwards of 9,000 older people. Sixty four organisations will continue to receive funding under the Scheme to Support National Organisations in the Community and Voluntary Sector, as will the 21 volunteer centres and other volunteering initiatives. 
  * Employment levels will be maintained at existing levels in 450 community projects under the Community Services Programme (CSP) by requiring projects to generate additional resources from their operations. 
  * Increased funding for the EU co-funded Rural Development Programme for Ireland 2007-2013 (LEADER). 
  * Capital funding of €33m (including Údarás na Gaeltachta) is being provided for the Gaeltacht and Islands in 2010. This allocation includes investment in marine works, road improvements, access to the islands and water schemes. 
  * Continued support for language development programmes under Ciste na Gaeilge and the Advanced Irish Language Skills Initiative for third-level institutions. Capital funding of €0.6m will facilitate the expansion of Irish language social and cultural centres in the main urban areas.
