##  Introduction

If you have a valid driving licence, you can rent a car or a larger vehicle.

You will usually have to show proof of identity (for example, your passport)
and a credit card (or debit card if accepted). You will also need to show your
valid driving licence. Check with the rental company to see if you need more
documentation, for example [ an international driverâ€™s permit ](/en/travel-
and-recreation/motoring/driver-licensing/international-driving-permit/) .

There are many companies offering car rental services. Check you are using [
an approved car rental company
](http://www.carrentalcouncil.ie/Companies.html) . If you are going through a
car hire broker, check they are using an approved car rental company. Approved
car rental companies must make sure all rentals are safe and roadworthy.

##  Rental agreement

You will be asked to sign a rental agreement or contract when you pick up the
car. Before you sign it, make sure you have read it and understand what your
obligations are. For example, you may need to return the car with a full tank
of fuel to avoid extra charges. If you are unsure about anything, always ask
your rental company to explain it to you.

If you plan on taking the rented car across a national border, ask the car
rental company beforehand if this is possible.

##  Important checks at pickup

Make sure to check the car thoroughly before you drive away.

You will usually get a diagram of the car with exterior damage marked on it.
Check the car for any extra damage and make sure this is recorded before you
drive away. You can be charged for any damage that is not marked on the
diagram or damage report.

Even if you arrive at the car rental depot at night, use a torch or flash
light to give the car a thorough check before you accept it.

**Other things to check**  
---  
**Tyres** |  Check they are inflated and in good condition.  Check the spare tyre as well.   
**Tools** |  Check there is a jack and a wrench to replace a tyre if you get a puncture.  Make sure you have all the safety equipment you need for the area you are travelling.   
**Fuel** |  Ask if the car runs on petrol or diesel (you may have to cover any damage if you put the wrong type of fuel in the car).  Usually you need to refill the car before you return it. Check you have a full tank when you start.   
**Lights** |  Check your lights are all working properly, including indicators, break lights and fog lights.   
**Windscreen** |  Give the windscreen a thorough check and ask for any flaws to be repaired. Make sure that the wiper blades and the windscreen wash system is working properly.   
  
##  Insurance

Make sure you have the right insurance. If you and someone else will both be
driving the car, make sure you both have insurance. You must have at least [
third-party insurance cover ](/en/travel-and-recreation/motoring-1/motor-tax-
and-insurance/motor-insurance#l93e5c) .

The rental company may offer you a lower price for not giving you particular
cover (such as collision damage). Before you agree to waive any cover, make
sure you understand what it means and whether it's worth the risk. Ask how
this discount works, for example, you may have to pay a deposit in case you
damage the car in a crash.

##  Returning the car

When you return the car to the car rental company, make sure that you have the
car checked while you are there. Any damage should be noted and agreed with
the rental company, to avoid charges for damage you did not know about.

Even if you bought a damage waiver, car rental companies can charge your card
for any excess amounts if there is a lot of damage.

If you are returning the car when the office is closed, make sure you know
what to do and who to contact if there are any problems. The rental agreement
should cover the arrangements and procedures for out of hours returns.

##  Drivers over 75

If you are 75 or over, you may have to meet some extra conditions before
hiring a car.

For example, you could be asked for:

  * Confirmation that you drive regularly 
  * A letter from your insurer to say you have an up-to-date policy and no accidents in last 5 years 
  * A letter from your doctor confirming you are fit to drive 

You could also be asked to do a driving assessment with a staff member from
the car hire company.

##  How to make a complaint

If you have a complaint about a car that you have rented in Ireland, first go
to the company and ask them to fix the problem. If you are still not
satisfied, contact the [ Car Rental Council of Ireland
](http://www.carrentalcouncil.ie/) who have a complaints procedure for member
companies.

If you have a complaint with a car rental company in another EU member state,
contact the [ European Consumer Centre ](https://www.eccireland.ie/) for
advice on your rights and help with your complaint.
