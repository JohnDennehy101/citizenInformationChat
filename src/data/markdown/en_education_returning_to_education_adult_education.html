##  Adult learners returning to education

You may have left school early, be unemployed, or want to reskill for a new
job.

No matter your reason for wanting to return to education, there are many
options available to you and a range of supports.

You can return to education with a [ full-time course
](https://www.fetchcourses.ie/courses/fulltime) or a [ part-time course
](https://www.fetchcourses.ie/courses/parttime) .

This page provides information about returning to education and the
organisations providing support. You can find out more about [ further
education and training courses ](/en/education/further-education-and-
training/training-courses/) .

##  Courses with low or no entry requirements

You don't need to have a Junior Certificate or Leaving Certificate to take
part in many [ full-time courses
](https://www.fetchcourses.ie/courses/fulltime) or [ part-time courses
](https://www.fetchcourses.ie/courses/parttime) .

There are [ adult literacy
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/education/returning-to-
education/adult-literacy/) supports to help with reading, writing and maths.
There are opportunities to study for [ the Leaving Certificate
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/education/primary-and-post-primary-
education/going-to-post-primary-school/senior-cycle/) or other certificates.
There are also a wide range of courses linked to business and industry.

Many courses are provided by your local [ Education and Training Board
](http://www.etbi.ie/etbs/directory-of-etbs/) .

You may also qualify for a free course under the [ Back to Education
Initiative (BTEI) ](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/f4113d-operational-
guidelines-back-to-education-part-time-education-option/) .

###  **Evening classes**

Evening classes can offer you a social way to learn or to get a qualification.

Evening classes take place during term time in [ Education and Training Boards
(ETBs) ](http://www.etbi.ie/etbs/directory-of-etbs/) , schools, colleges and
universities throughout the country. The courses on offer vary from centre to
centre, so you should look around if you have interests you'd like to pursue.

##  Courses with an entry requirement

Some courses are only open to you if you have completed your second-level
education ( [ post-primary school
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/education/primary-and-post-primary-
education/going-to-post-primary-school/) ). However, you should check the with
the school or college, as some courses make exceptions for mature students and
people returning to education.

  * Full-time and part-time [ third-level courses ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/education/third-level-education/applying-to-college/third-level-courses-for-mature-students/) . 

##  Can I get a qualification with adult education?

Yes, you can get a qualification with many adult education courses.

Getting a qualification is not always a goal for learners, but you can get
advice from your local ETB.

The [ National Framework of Qualifications (NFQ) ](https://www.qqi.ie/what-we-
do/the-qualifications-system/national-framework-of-qualifications) outlines
the levels of qualifications across the Irish education and training system.
It shows how you can move from informal education (starting with a part-time
course or evening class) to further education, and then to higher education.
