##  Introduction

If you have left school without any formal qualifications, the [ Youthreach
programme ](https://www.gov.ie/en/service/5666e9-youthreach/) can provide you
with opportunities for basic education, personal development, vocational
training and work experience.

The programme is generally full-time, although part-time courses can be
arranged. You can concentrate on a core training area of your choice but basic
subjects, such as English, maths and life skills, are generally covered by all
trainees.

Opportunities to improve literacy and numeracy are available at all Youthreach
centres.

###  How Youthreach works

The course generally lasts from 1 to 2 years, although it can be flexible,
depending on your individual needs. If you complete the basic training
successfully, you will be awarded a Foundation Certification from [ Quality
and Qualifications Ireland (QQI) ](http://www.qqi.ie/) or the [ Junior
Certificate. ](/en/education/state-examinations/junior-cycle-exam-and-
results/) Having completed a Foundation Programme, you may continue to a
Progression Programme. This will give you the opportunity to progress to the [
Leaving Certificate Applied ](/en/education/state-examinations/leaving-
certificate-applied/) course or a higher-level QQI award or you can choose to
continue other skills training, such as an [ apprenticeship
](/en/education/further-education-and-training/apprenticeships/) course.

The courses take place in Youthreach centres managed by Education and Training
Boards (ETBs) and Community Training Centres. Generally, Youthreach centres
are open for 35 hours per week (9 a.m. - 4.30 p.m., Monday to Friday).

If you qualify for Youthreach, you may also be eligible for the [ Back to
Education Initiative ](https://www.gov.ie/en/service/24e75-back-to-education-
initiative/) .

**Education and Training Boards**

Since 1 July 2013, Education and Training Boards (ETBs) replaced Vocational
Educational Committees (VECs). All services provided by VECs will continue to
be provided by ETBs. FÁS training centres have also transferred to ETBs.

##  Who is eligible for Youthreach?

The criteria you must meet to access the Youthreach programme depends on
whether you apply to a Youthreach centre managed by an Education and Training
Board (ETB) or a Community Training Centre.

**ETB Youthreach programme**

If you apply for Youthreach provided by your local ETB, you should be between
15 and 20 years of age. You must be unemployed and an early school leaver
without any vocational training and who has not attempted the Leaving
Certificate. Some exceptions can be made to this rule, for example if you are
a lone parent.

**Community Training Centre Youthreach programme**

If you apply for Youthreach provided by your local [ Community Training Centre
](http://www.iacto.ie/learners/ctcs/) , you should be between 16 and 21 years
of age. However, young people under the age of 25 who are disadvantaged and
unemployed may attend the programme with agreement from SOLAS.

The training on offer varies from centre to centre, often depending on the
facilities available. If you have an interest in a particular career, you
should look for a centre offering a suitable course rather than applying
automatically to the centre nearest to you.

**Jobseeker’s payment**

Participants leaving Youthreach can apply for a [ jobseeker’s payment
](/en/social-welfare/unemployed-people/signing-on/) . The [ 3 month
disqualification rule ](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/1a5134-operational-
guidelines-jobseekers-
allowance/?referrer=https://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/Jobseekers-
Allowance.aspx#disqualifications) which applies to many students does not
apply to Youthreach participants.

##  Rates for Youthreach

Courses are free. Trainees aged over 16 get a weekly allowance. You will get a
travel allowance if you have to travel 5 km or more to the centre. You may
also qualify for [ free childcare ](/en/education/pre-school-education-and-
childcare/national-childcare-scheme/) and a meal allowance - you should check
with the centre.

From January 2023, weekly allowances are as follows:

Trainee(s)  |  maximum payment per week   
---|---  
16 - 17 years  |  €45   
18 years and over  |  €232.00 (with some exceptions)   
  
If you were getting a reduced age-related Jobseeker's Allowance (JA) before
starting Youthreach any means that were deducted from your JA will also be
deducted from your training allowance. This also applies to people getting a
reduced age-related basic Supplementary Welfare Allowance (SWA).

If you are over 18 years of age and you are currently getting a social welfare
payment of more than €232, you will continue to get the higher amount while
you are on Youthreach as long as you are eligible.

You can take up part-time work while on Youthreach without it affecting your
training allowance.

##  How to apply for Youthreach

Youthreach courses are held year-round and you can apply to join a course at
