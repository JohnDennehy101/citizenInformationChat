##  What is the Work Placement Experience Programme (WPEP)?

The [ Work Placement Experience Programme (WPEP)
](https://www.gov.ie/en/service/95fe1-work-placement-experience-programme/)
gives people who have never had a job or who have lost their job a chance to
get work experience.

WPEP aims to give you the opportunity to re-train and get experience in a new
role, while on a work placement in a host organisation.

You must be aged 18 to 65, unemployed for at least 4 months (if you are under
30) or 6 months (if you are over 30) and currently getting a qualifying social
welfare payment – see 'Rules' below.

Participation is voluntary. There will be no financial penalties if you do not
wish to participate in the scheme or if you drop out.

The scheme is open to host organisations in the private, public, civil
service, community and voluntary sectors.

WPEP is a scheme under the [ Pathways to Work Strategy 2021-2025
](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/1feaf-pathways-to-
work-2021/?referrer=http://www.gov.ie/pathways/) . A previous placement
scheme, [ Youth Employment Support Scheme (YESS)
](/en/employment/unemployment-and-redundancy/employment-support-schemes/youth-
employment-support-scheme/) , which was similar to WPEP, finished in July
2021.

##  Who is eligible for WPEP?

You must be aged between 18 and 65 and be:

  * On a qualifying scheme for at least 4 months (104 days) if under age 30, **or**
  * On a qualifying scheme for at least 6 months (156 days) if over age 30 **and**
  * Currently getting a qualifying payment (see below) 

###  **What are the qualifying payments?**

You must have been getting one of the following payments:

  * [ Jobseeker's Benefit ](/en/social-welfare/unemployed-people/jobseekers-benefit/)
  * [ Jobseeker's Allowance ](/en/social-welfare/unemployed-people/jobseekers-allowance/)
  * [ Jobseeker's Transitional payment ](/en/social-welfare/unemployed-people/jobseekers-transitional-payment/)
  * [ One-Parent Family Payment ](/en/social-welfare/unemployed-people/jobseekers-transitional-payment/)
  * [ Disability Allowance ](/en/social-welfare/disability-and-illness/disability-allowance/)
  * [ Blind Person’s Pension ](/en/social-welfare/disability-and-illness/blind-persons-pension/)
  * [ Farm Assist ](/en/social-welfare/farming-and-fishing/farm-assist/) and [ Fish Assist ](https://www.gov.ie/en/service/bbdf0f-fish-assist/)
  * [ Jobseeker's Benefit for the Self-Employed ](/en/social-welfare/unemployed-people/jobseekers-benefit-self-employed/)

If you are getting the One-Parent Family, Disability Allowance or Blind
Pension, you will automatically qualify for WPEP. You do not need to meet the
156-day qualifying period.

###  **Other schemes that count towards the qualifying period**

The qualifying period can also include time spent on schemes such as the
following:

  * [ Community Employment Scheme (CE) ](/en/employment/unemployment-and-redundancy/employment-support-schemes/community-employment-scheme/)
  * [ Tús ](/en/employment/unemployment-and-redundancy/employment-support-schemes/tus/)
  * [ Rural Social Scheme (RSS) ](/en/social-welfare/farming-and-fishing/rural-social-scheme/)
  * [ Back to Education Allowance ](/en/social-welfare/back-to-education/back-to-education-allowance/)
  * [ Youthreach ](/en/education/further-education-and-training/youthreach/)
  * [ Springboard ](/en/education/third-level-education/applying-to-college/springboard/)
  * [ Solas Training Programmes ](https://www.solas.ie/)

You must transfer to a Jobseekers payment before you can take up the
placement.

If you spent time in prison, this may count towards the 156-day qualifying
period, as long as you are entitled to a qualifying social welfare payment.

###  **Situations where no qualifying period is needed**

No qualifying period is needed if you are getting a qualifying DSP payment and
your Employment Personal Advisor recognises that you face challenges entering
the job market. Challenges might include:

  * Having a disability or dealing with mental health issues 
  * Belonging to the Travelling or Roma community 
  * Being a refugee or migrant 
  * Losing your job later in your career as an older person 
  * Taking time out of work for caring responsibilities (not receiving Carer’s Allowance and must be on an eligible payment) 
  * Having spent time in prison 

###  Contracted Public Employment Services (CPES)

If you are on [ JobPath ](https://www.gov.ie/en/policy-
information/9e575c-jobpath/?referrer=https://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/JobPath.aspx)
or a [ Local Employment Services (LES)
](https://www.gov.ie/en/collection/d6f636-employment-services-offices/)
customer, you are eligible to participate in WPEP.

You can get more information in the [ scheme guidelines
](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/98f23-operational-guidelines-work-
placement-experience-programme/#eligibility-criteria) .

###  **Who is not eligible for WPEP?**

You are not eligible if you:

  * Are getting a casual jobseeker payment 
  * Are signing only for jobseeker credits 
  * Are in full-time education or full-time training 
  * Are getting other DSP income supports such as the [ Back to Education Allowance ](/en/social-welfare/back-to-education/back-to-education-allowance/) , [ Back to Work Enterprise Allowance ](/en/social-welfare/social-welfare-payments-and-work/back-to-work-enterprise-allowance/) or [ Short-Term Enterprise Allowance ](/en/social-welfare/social-welfare-payments-and-work/short-term-enterprise-allowance/)
  * Currently or previously were a member of boards of management or held directorships with the host or affiliated business 
  * Had a previous employment relationship with the host in the same role in the last 18 months 

###  **Change in circumstances**

If you have a change in circumstances when you are on the programme, for
example, if you get a job, you should notify your [ Department of Social
Protection (DSP) Intreo Centre/Scheme Area
](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/8ae08d-workplace-supports-contact-list/)
immediately.

##  How does WPEP work?

The DSP will provide a case officer, who will contact you and your host
organisation throughout your placement. The placement will be monitored with
monthly reporting to make sure that it continues to meet the [ scheme
guidelines ](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/98f23-operational-guidelines-
work-placement-experience-programme/) .

###  **Training and development**

When you start, you agree on a learning and development plan with the host
organisation. This will detail the skills and experience that you will have
the opportunity to learn. You are expected to complete 60 hours of training
that is provided by your organisation or on part-time education and training
courses. 20 of the 60 hours should be accredited or sector specific training.

Your host organisation will nominate someone to support and mentor you. At the
end of your placement, you will be given a reference stating your work
experience and the skills and learning you have gained.

You can get a [ Training Support Grant
](http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/Training-Support-Grant.aspx) of up to €1,000
if needed. The grant is available regardless of whether you availed of the
grant before.

###  **Duration of scheme**

The scheme lasts for 6 months and there is no option to extend the placement.

You will be eligible to do 2 placements in total, up to a maximum period of 12
months (52 weeks). The placements must be with different host organisations,
with a 4-week gap in between.

You will work 30 hours a week over 4 or 5 days each week. The 30 hours
includes time spent on training.

###  **Annual leave**

You will be entitled to all the [ public holidays ](/en/employment/employment-
rights-and-conditions/leave-and-holidays/public-holidays/) and 11 days of
annual leave during your 6-month placement.

###  WPEP and part-time work

You can do part-time work during the WPEP placement if it does not interfere
with the required hours of the placement. Part-time work will not affect the
rate of WPEP paid. You are not allowed to work part-time with the WPEP host.

##  Rates

You will be paid a weekly WPEP allowance of €335 by DSP.

If you are entitled to increases for a qualified adult or qualified children
or any social welfare secondary benefits (such as [ Fuel Allowance
](/en/social-welfare/extra-social-welfare-benefits/fuel-allowance/) or [
Christmas bonus) ](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/christmas-
bonus/) , you will continue to get these payments in addition to the main WPEP
payment.

##  How to apply

All WPEP placements will be advertised on [ jobsireland.ie
](https://www.jobsireland.ie/) . You should check for placements that you are
interested in applying for. You must apply for a placement online on
jobsireland.ie.

Host organisations will decide on the application process and may have
selection procedures such as requesting a CV or inviting you for an interview.
