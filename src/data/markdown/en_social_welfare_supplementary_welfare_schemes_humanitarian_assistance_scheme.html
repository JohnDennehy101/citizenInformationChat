##  What is the Humanitarian Assistance Scheme?

The Humanitarian Assistance Scheme is an income-tested scheme that provides
emergency financial assistance to households affected by a severe weather
event such as flooding.

It is administered by the Community Welfare Service.

The scheme provides financial support to people who have suffered damage to
their home. It is designed to help you meet the cost of essential needs and
repairs rather than provide full compensation for losses or damage.

##  What does the Humanitarian Assistance Scheme cover?

The scheme covers:

  * Emergency income support payments 
  * Damage to your home and its essential contents, such as carpets, flooring, furniture, household appliances and bedding 
  * Structural damage 

The scheme is usually only available to help people who have been impacted by
a severe weather event, but the Department of Social Protection can extend it
to cover other exceptional circumstances at their discretion.

###  **What does the scheme not cover?**

The scheme does not cover:

  * Losses covered by an insurance policy 
  * Loss of items deemed to be not essential or luxury items 
  * Commercial and business losses 
  * Loss or damage to private rented accommodation or local authority accommodation 

##  How do I qualify for help under the scheme?

Your household’s income is assessed to determine your household’s ability to
meet the costs of restoring your home to a habitable condition.

All household income will be considered in the income test. You do not have to
be getting a social welfare payment to qualify.

###  **How does the income test work?**

How the income test works depends on the number of people in the household.

When you apply, you will need to provide personal and financial details for
each person who lives in your home and explain their relationship to you.

####  **If you are single**

If you have a gross household income of €50,000 or less, you will get 100% of
the amount allowable.

For each whole €1,000 of household income above €50,000, you will be required
to make a 1% contribution to the amount allowable.

For example, if you are:

  * Single, and 
  * Have a gross household income of €55,000 

You will get 95% of the amount allowable (€5,000 over the income limit of
€50,000 = 5% personal contribution towards the loss).

####  **If you are in a couple**

If you are married, in a civil partnership or cohabiting and have a combined
gross household income of €90,000 or less, you will get 100% of the amount
allowable.

For each whole €1,000 of household income above €90,000, you will be required
to make a 1% contribution to the amount allowable.

For example, if you are:

  * Married, in a civil partnership or cohabiting, and 
  * Have a combined gross household income of €105,000 

You will get 85% of the amount allowable (€15,000 over the income limit of
€90,000 = 15% personal contribution to the loss).

####  **Increases for qualified children**

The income limits are increased by €15,000 for [ each qualified child
](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/claiming-a-social-welfare-
payment/claiming-and-increase-in-your-payment-for-a-child-dependant/) .

####  **One-parent household**

The income limits that apply to couples also apply to one-parent households:
€90,000 plus €15,000 for each dependent child.

####  **Non-dependent adult household members**

For each non-dependent adult member of the household, 20% of their gross
income is added to the household income.

For example, a household with:

  * A couple with a gross income of €85,000, and 
  * A non-dependent adult with an income of €20,000 

Will receive 100% of the amount allowable as the household income is less than
€90,000 (€85,000 + €4,000 [€20,000 x 20%] = €89,000).

**If you have no insurance**

If you had no insurance and you do not have reasonable grounds for not having
insurance:

  * You will be expected to contribute the first €2,000 toward the amount allowable, and 
  * Your personal contribution will be 2% for each whole €1,000 above the appropriate income level for your household 

##  How much can I get under the scheme?

How much is paid under the scheme depends on how severe the damage is and your
ability to meet these costs.

Where the cost of structural repairs is estimated to be more than €5,000, the
Department of Social Protection will appoint and get advice from a loss
adjudicator.

In assessing cases for humanitarian assistance, account will be taken of [
Additional Needs Payments ](/en/social-welfare/supplementary-welfare-
schemes/additional-needs-payment/) already paid out.
