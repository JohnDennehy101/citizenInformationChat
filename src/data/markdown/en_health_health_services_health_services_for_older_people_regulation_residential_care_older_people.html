#  Regulation of residential care for older people

  * Introduction 
  * Registration and inspection of residential care 
  * The standards 
  * How to complain about a residential service 
  * Where to apply 

##  Introduction

Residential care services must meet certain standards which include the
quality of accommodation and care.

[ The Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) ](http://www.hiqa.ie/)
is responsible for inspecting and registering residential care services for
older people, such as nursing homes.

All residential care services must be registered and independently inspected.
This includes public, private and voluntary nursing homes.

Before July 2009 the Health Service Executive (HSE) was responsible for the
registration and inspection of private and voluntary residential care services
and provided [ inspection reports up to that date
](http://www.hse.ie/eng/services/publications/olderpeople/Nursing_Home_Reports/)
.

##  Registration and inspection of residential care

By law, all residential services must be inspected and registered by HIQA to
be allowed to operate. Residential services must re-register with HIQA every 3
years.

HIQA inspections ensure that services meet the requirements set out by the [
Health Act (2007)
](https://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2013/si/415/made/en/print) and the [
National Standards ](https://www.hiqa.ie/reports-and-
publications/standard/national-standards-residential-care-settings-older-
people-ireland) . If the service does not comply with the regulations or meet
the Standards, it may fail to achieve registration status or lose its
registration status.

The inspections are a mixture of both announced and unannounced visits. They
can happen at any time. This includes during the day, evenings, and weekends
or at night.

The registration and inspection process is independent and reports are
published after every inspection. The inspection reports provide information
to residents, their families and the general public about the standards of
care in individual centres.

You can view the [ registers of residential centres for older people
](http://www.hiqa.ie/resource-centre/registered-centres) and the [ current
inspection reports on the HIQA website ](http://www.hiqa.ie/social-care/find-
a-centre/inspection-
reports?field_report_type_centre_value_many_to_one=reportolderpeoples) .

##  The standards

The [ National Standards for Residential Care Settings for Older People in
Ireland (pdf) ](https://www.hiqa.ie/reports-and-
publications/standard/national-standards-residential-care-settings-older-
people-ireland) aim to make sure the needs of people living in residential
services are met and that there is a high quality of care.

The standards aim to help residents participate in, and contribute to, daily
life.

These include:

  * Promoting your rights and respecting your autonomy, privacy and dignity 
  * Supporting you to be as independent as possible and to exercise personal choice in your daily life 
  * Safeguarding and protecting you from abuse 
  * Providing you with information and assessment so you can get the appropriate supports to meet your needs 

##  How to complain about a residential service

If you, a member of your family or someone acting on your behalf have concerns
about your care, you should first try to resolve these with the management of
the residential service.

By law, all care providers must have a process for handling complaints and
must tell you how you can make a complaint. If you complain to your care
service provider and you are not happy with the response, [ contact the Office
of the Ombudsman ](https://www.ombudsman.ie/making-a-complaint/make-a-
complaint/) .

The Ombudsman investigate all complaints about public and private residential
care. It doesn't matter if you're paying for the care yourself or it's funded
by the HSE.

You can also [ share this information with HIQA ](http://www.hiqa.ie/social-
care/using-care-services/reporting-concern) .

HIQA do not have the power to investigate individual complaints but they can
use the information to decide whether the service is meeting the needs of the
people who live there. If HIQA find they are not, they can take action to make
sure that care services are improved.

HIQA have published information on [ how to make a complaint about a nursing
home (pdf) ](https://www.hiqa.ie/sites/default/files/2019-06/Feedback-Older-
peoples-services.pdf) .

##  Where to apply

You can inspect the [ registers of residential centres for older people
](http://www.hiqa.ie/resource-centre/registered-centres) and the [ inspection
reports ](http://www.hiqa.ie/social-care/find-a-centre/inspection-
reports?field_report_type_centre_value_many_to_one=reportolderpeoples) on the
HIQA website. Apply to individual residential care services for details of
their cost and conditions.

More information on the registration and inspection of residential care
services, as well as on the National Standards, is available on the [ HIQA
website ](https://www.hiqa.ie/reports-and-publications/standard/national-
standards-residential-care-settings-older-people-ireland) .
