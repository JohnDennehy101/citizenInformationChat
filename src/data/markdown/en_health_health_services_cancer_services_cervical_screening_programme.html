##  Introduction

CervicalCheck is Ireland's screening programme to prevent cervical cancer. The
programme provides free, regular cervical screening tests to women and people
with a cervix between the ages of 25 and 65. A HPV cervical screening test is
a simple procedure that only takes minutes.

A cervical screening test is not a test for cancer. It is a test to help
prevent cancer from developing. Getting a cervical screening test, [ the HPV
vaccine
](https://www.hse.ie/eng/health/immunisation/pubinfo/schoolprog/hpv/about/)
and not smoking are [ some ways to protect yourself from cervical cancer
](https://www2.hse.ie/conditions/cervical-cancer/prevention/) .

If you have any questions or concerns about the screening programme, contact [
CervicalCheck ](http://www.cervicalcheck.ie/) on Freephone 1800 45 45 55.

If you have any concerns about cervical cancer or have [ symptoms of cervical
cancer ](https://www2.hse.ie/conditions/cervical-cancer/symptoms.html) , you
should contact your family doctor (GP). If you do not have a GP, you can [
find a GP in your area ](https://www2.hse.ie/services/find-a-gp/) .

##  HPV cervical screening

The HPV cervical screening test is a new test that looks for high-risk types
of HPV cells. These HPV cells can cause cervical cancer. Before March 2020, a
previous method of screening was used. This was called a smear test and it
only checked for abnormal cells.

[ Read more about HPV cervical screening ](https://www2.hse.ie/screening-and-
vaccinations/cervical-screening/what-cervical-screening-is.html) .

If high-risk HPV cells are found then you will be checked for abnormal or pre-
cancerous cervical cells.

##  Who should get a HPV cervical screening test?

Women and people with a cervix who are aged between 25 and 65 should get a HPV
cervical screening test when it is due.

####  When can I book a cervical screening test?

If you are aged 25 to 29 years, you should be screened every 3 years.

If you are aged 30 to 65 years, you should be screened every 5 years.

Some people will need to be screened more often. If this applies to you,
CervicalCheck will write to you and let you know.

##  How to get a HPV cervical screening test

CervicalCheck will send invitation letters to anyone on the CervicalCheck
register who is aged between 25 and 65.

You should already be on the register if you:

  * Are between 25 and 65 and have a PPS number **or**
  * Have previously had a test through CervicalCheck 

[ Check if you are on the CervicalCheck register
](https://www2.hse.ie/screening-and-vaccinations/cervical-screening/check-the-
cervicalcheck-register.html) .

When you receive your invitation letter, you should contact a registered GP or
nurse to make an appointment. Find out [ where you can have a cervical
screening test ](https://www2.hse.ie/screening-and-vaccinations/cervical-
screening/where-you-can-have-a-cervical-screening-test.html) .

You do not need to wait for a letter to book an appointment if:

  * You missed your last cervical screening test 
  * Your next test is due 

You also do not need to be on the register to have a free screening test.

If your test is due, you can book a test with a [ GP or nurse who is
registered with CervicalCheck ](https://apps.cervicalcheck.ie/screening-
locations/find-a-
smeartaker.588.findsmeartakersearch.html?_ga=2.86931227.2034640867.1624349721-1056890493.1611917890)
.

You can read about [ what happens at a cervical screening test appointment
](https://www2.hse.ie/screening-and-vaccinations/cervical-screening/what-
happens.html) .

####  **CervicalCheck test results**

You will usually get your results by letter within 4 weeks of your screening
test.

If you have waited longer, phone your GP or clinic to see if they have any
updates. You can [ check what your HPV cervical cancer results mean
](https://www2.hse.ie/screening-and-vaccinations/cervical-screening/your-
results/your-results.html) .

##  Private cervical screening

If you want to have a HPV cervical screening test but you are not due to have
one, you can pay to have it done privately.

CervicalCheck will not have access to your private screening results, and the
private lab checking your sample will not have access to your CervicalCheck
screening history.

Private gynaecologists are not registered with CervicalCheck.

##  Further information

hse.ie/cervical-screening ](https://www2.hse.ie/cervical-screening/) .

You can also free-phone CervicalCheck on 1800 45 45 55.
