##  What is a controlled drug?

A controlled drug is an illegal substance, product or preparation that has
been specified in the [ Misuse of Drugs Act 1977
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1977/en/act/pub/0012/index.html) or [ Misuse
of Drugs Regulations
](https://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/ResultsTitle.html?q=misuse+drugs+regulations)
. The law has been updated several times.

The [ Criminal Justice (Psychoactive Substances) Act 2010
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2010/en/act/pub/0022/sec0020.html#sec20) also
covers substances which are not specifically banned under the Misuse of Drugs
Acts, but which have psychoactive effects.

Controlled drugs also include certain tablets and medicines that can be
purchased on prescription. It is an offence to possess these drugs if you do
not have a prescription.

Some of the most common controlled drugs seized in Ireland include:

  * Cannabis 
  * Cocaine 
  * Heroin 
  * LSD 
  * Amphetamines 
  * Ketamine 

You can read more about different types of drugs on the [ HSE’s Drugs.ie
website ](https://www.drugs.ie/drugtypes/) .

###  **Laws covering drug offences**

The [ Misuse of Drugs Act 1977
](https://revisedacts.lawreform.ie/eli/1977/act/12/front/revised/en/html) and
the [ Misuse of Drugs Act 1984
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1984/en/act/pub/0018/index.html) , as amended
are the primary pieces of legislation under which you can be criminally
charged for drug offences.

##  Possession of controlled drugs

###  **Cannabis or cannabis resin**

If you are found in possession of cannabis or cannabis resin, you are guilty
of an offence. This can be dealt with in different ways depending on when the
offence took place and if you have been guilty of an offence before.

####  **Adult Cautioning Scheme**

If the offence happened on or after 14 December 2020, it may be dealt with
under the [ Adult Cautioning Scheme
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/justice/law-enforcement/adult-
cautioning-scheme/) . If it is dealt with under this Scheme, you will receive
a caution and not be prosecuted.

The Gardaí must consider a number of factors to see if the scheme is
appropriate for your alleged offence.

They must consider:

  * The type, quantity and value of the drug, and 
  * Whether the offence amounts to simple possession once all the circumstances are considered 

####  **Prosecution and first offence**

If the matter is prosecuted, the court can give you a [ class D fine
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/justice/criminal-law/criminal-
trial/maximum-fines-on-summary-conviction/) on [ summary conviction

offences/classification-of-crimes-in-criminal-cases/#l689a5) in a [ District
Court ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/justice/courts-system/district-
court/) .

for either:

  * Possessing drugs with a market value of €13,000 or more, or 
  * Importing drugs with a market value of €13,000 or more 

However, if the court decides that there are exceptional circumstances in your
case, this minimum sentence does not apply.

####  **Intention to supply into a prison facility**

If you are found to be supplying, or attempting to supply, a controlled drug
into a prison, [ children detention school

##  Combating drug use and drug trafficking

There are a number of Garda units and other initiatives aimed at combating
drug abuse and drug trafficking internationally and locally.

These include:

  * The [ Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau ](https://www.garda.ie/en/about-us/organised-serious-crime/garda-national-drugs-and-organised-crime-bureau/) which targets national and international drugs trafficking 
  * The [ Criminal Assets Bureau ](https://www.cab.ie/) which seizes the assets of people who have been convicted of drug trafficking 
  * Local and Regional Drugs Task Forces in areas with the highest levels of drug use 
  * [ Garda juvenile liaison (pdf) ](https://www.garda.ie/en/crime-prevention/community-engagement/community-engagement-offices/garda-youth-diversion-bureau/juvenile-liaison-officers.pdf) officers who work with young people to try and prevent them from getting involved with drugs 
  * [ Community Policing ](https://www.garda.ie/en/crime-prevention/community-policing/) initiatives to tackle drug problems in local communities 
  * Awareness-raising programmes such as the [ Garda Schools Programme ](https://www.garda.ie/en/crime-prevention/community-engagement/community-engagement-offices/) and the [ Garda Youth Diversion Programme ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/justice/children-and-young-offenders/garda-juvenile-diversion-programme/)

You can [ report drug dealing
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/justice/crime-and-crime-
prevention/reporting-drug-dealing/#2aa843) to the Gardai anonymously (see ‘How
to report suspicious activity, drug smuggling and drug dealing’ below).

###  **How the Customs service tackle drug trafficking**

Customs are responsible for [ detecting and seizing controlled drugs at
importation ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/travel-and-
recreation/travel-to-ireland/examination-of-travellers-baggage-by-customs-and-
excise-officers/) . Customs is operated by Revenue.

Customs cooperate with:

  * The Gardaí in areas of drug law enforcement and in the operation of the [ Criminal Assets Bureau ](https://www.revenue.ie/en/corporate/assist-us/drug-and-tobacco-smuggling/criminal-assets-bureau-cab.aspx)
  * The Gardaí and Naval Services at a local level to prevent drug trafficking 
  * Customs and law enforcement agencies of other countries to [ track the movements of suspicious goods or people ](https://www.revenue.ie/en/corporate/assist-us/drug-and-tobacco-smuggling/international-co-operation.aspx)
  * Businesses by offering advice and [ drug smuggling awareness training ](https://www.revenue.ie/en/corporate/assist-us/drug-and-tobacco-smuggling/intelligence-and-operations.aspx) to staff 
  * The chemical industry to detect diversion of chemicals that could be used to make illegal drugs 

Customs is also involved in the [ Multi-Disciplinary Group on Organised Crime
](https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/policies/eu-fight-against-crime/) .

**Customs Drugs Watch**

The Customs service [ gathers intelligence
](https://www.revenue.ie/en/corporate/assist-us/drug-and-tobacco-
smuggling/customs-drugs-watch.aspx) to identify possible drug smuggling routes
and to identify suspicious people who may be involved in drug trafficking.
Maritime and drug detector dog units are placed at major ports, airports, and
other coastal locations nationwide to detect and prevent drug smuggling.

##  Court-ordered drug treatment

For some drug offences, the court may decide that imposing the usual penalties
is not the most effective response.

These offences include:

  * Illegal possession of controlled drugs 
  * Possession of controlled drugs for unlawful sale or supply 
  * Breaking the regulations about opium, growing opium poppies or cannabis plants 
  * Forging or fraudulently altering prescriptions 

If you have been convicted of one of these offences, [ the court can remand
you ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/justice/arrests/detention-after-
arrest/#lc10c8) for whatever period it considers necessary and request certain
reports. You cannot be remanded for longer than 8 days if you are being held
in custody.

###  **Types of reports the court can request**

While you are in remand, the court can ask the [ HSE
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/health/health-system/health-boards/) ,
a probation officer or another qualified person to:

  * Prepare a medical report 
  * Provide a report on your vocational, educational and social circumstance 
  * Make recommendations for your treatment 

If the court decides it is in your best interests, you may not be allowed to
see the contents of any report that has been prepared on your case. However,
the report will be made available to your [ barrister
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/justice/courtroom/barristers/) or [
solicitor
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/justice/courtroom/solicitors/) .

###  **Orders the court can make based on the reports**

Based on the findings of these reports, the court may decide not to impose a
fine or prison sentence on you.

To reduce the likelihood of you committing further drugs offences, the court
may do one of the following:

  * Place you under the supervision of a named person or body (such as the HSE) for a specified period 
  * Order you to get medical or other treatment that has been recommended for you 
  * Order you to complete education, instruction or training to improve your job prospects and help with your social rehabilitation 
  * Order you to attend a custodial treatment centre (see below) 

If you ignore an order of the court, you can be detained in a custodial
treatment centre or you can be given the usual penalties for your offence,
such as fines or a prison sentence.

###  **Detention in a custodial treatment centre**

Depending on the circumstances of your case, the court may order that you be
detained in a specialised custodial treatment centre.

The period you can be held for depends on your offence. You can be held for
either:

  * A maximum of one year, or 
  * The maximum prison sentence the court can give for your offence, if this is less than one year 

####  **Reviewing your detention in a custodial treatment centre**

If you have been sent to a custodial treatment centre by a court order, you
can make an application to the court that detention is no longer in your best
interest or in the best interests of other people at the centre.

Based on this application, the court can review your case and revoke the
detention order.

It can then decide to:

  * Order your continued detention, possibly in another treatment centre, if the court decides you still need treatment 
  * Order that you continue treatment, but not in a custodial detention centre 
  * Impose the usual penalties for your offence, such as a prison sentence or fine (if a prison sentence is imposed, the court must take into account the time you have already been detained in a treatment centre) 
  * Not impose any further penalties if the court is satisfied that you no longer need treatment and that your case warrants no further penalties 

###  **Supervised injecting facilities**

The [ Misuse of Drugs (Supervised Injecting Facilities Act) 2017
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2017/act/7/enacted/en/html#targetText=An%20Act%20to%20provide%20for,provide%20for%20matters%20related%20thereto.)
provides for the establishment and regulation of supervised injecting
facilities.

These facilities aim to reduce:

  * Harm to people who inject drugs 
  * The number of people injecting drugs in public places 
  * Drug litter in public places 

You can [ read more about supervised injecting facilities

injecting-centre/) on the HSE website.
