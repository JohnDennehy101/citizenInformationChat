##  Introduction

This page explains how to get around when you return to Ireland. It includes

vehicle from abroad.

##  Public transport in Ireland

transport across Ireland.

The public transport services available to you will depend on where you are in
Ireland.

the surrounding areas.

These services include:

Dublin Bus offer [ 24-hour services ](https://www.dublinbus.ie/24-hour-
timetables) which are in operation seven days a week across [ ten routes
](https://www.transportforireland.ie/getting-around/by-bus/night-services-
dublin/#:~:text=travel%20in%20Dublin.-,Night%20Services,which%20are%20in%20operation%20seven%20days%20a%20week%20across%20ten%20routes.,-15%20From%20Clongriffin)
.

[ Bus Éireann ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/travel-and-
recreation/public-transport/bus-services-in-ireland#l73394) provide Expressway
(intercity), commuter, local, and school bus services throughout Ireland. They
also operate coach services to Britain and Europe from ports at Dublin and
Rosslare Europort in association with Eurolines.

[ Local Link ](https://www.transportforireland.ie/support/your-tfi-local-link-
office/) provides public bus services in rural areas of Ireland. There are 15
Local Link offices.

**Train services**

The [ DART (Dublin Area Rapid Transit) ](https://www.irishrail.ie/about-
us/iarnrod-eireann-services/dart-commuter) runs along the east coast from
Malahide in County Dublin to Greystones in County Wicklow.

Iarnród Éireann (also known as Irish Rail) is the operator of the national
railway network of Ireland. You can visit the [ Iarnród Éireann website
](https://www.irishrail.ie/?gclid=EAIaIQobChMI8rzh6-6A6AIVh6ztCh3UvA63EAAYASAAEgIPUfD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds)
for information on ticketing and timetables.

It provides the [ following rail services between main towns and cities
](https://www.irishrail.ie/train-timetables/intercity-live-map) :

  * [ Commuter services ](https://www.irishrail.ie/about-us/iarnrod-eireann-services/dart-commuter) in the Dublin area between Dundalk, Dunboyne, Longford, Portlaoise and Gorey 
  * [ InterCity services ](https://www.irishrail.ie/about-us/iarnrod-eireann-services/intercity) depart from Heuston and Connolly Stations in Dublin and run to Belfast, Sligo, Ballina, Westport, Galway, Limerick, Ennis, Tralee, Cork, Waterford and Rosslare Europort

**Trams**

The Luas is a light rail network that connects the city centre with suburban
areas in Dublin. It has 2 tramlines, the green line and the red line. Find
information on Luas tickets, routes and timetables on [ luas.ie
](https://www.luas.ie/) .

**TaxSaver Commuter Ticket**

If you will be commuting to work, you can use the [ TaxSaver Commuter Ticket
Scheme ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/travel-and-recreation/public-
transport/public-transport-commuter-tickets-and-tax/) to buy cheaper travel
tickets through your employer.

**Leap card**

Use a [ Leap card ](https://www.leapcard.ie/Home/index.html) to pay a reduced
fare on public transport in certain counties in Ireland. It is a pre-paid
travel card for use on bus, train, DART and Luas services in:

  * Athlone 
  * Cork 
  * Dublin 
  * Galway 
  * Kilkenny 
  * Limerick 
  * Sligo 
  * Waterford 
  * Wexford 

**Free Travel Scheme**

The [ Free Travel Scheme ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-
welfare/extra-social-welfare-benefits/free-travel/) allows you to travel for
free on public transport and some private bus and ferry services. Everyone
aged 66 and over, living permanently in Ireland, can get the Free Travel
Scheme. You may also qualify if you are under 66 and you have disability or
you are a carer.

If you are 66 or over and have Free Travel you can also travel free of charge
on bus and rail services in Northern Ireland using a [ Senior Smartpass card
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/social-welfare-
payments/extra-social-welfare-benefits/free-travel#l2ad8a) .

###  **Changes to the Free Travel Scheme in 2024**

From 29 July 2024, you will qualify for the Free Travel Scheme if you are aged
over 17 and under 66, and:

  * Have never been able to drive due to a disability 
  * Have a driving licence and are medically certified as ‘not fit to drive’ for at least 12 months. 

While the change won’t take effect until July, you can download and fill in an
[ application form for Free Travel for people medically certified unfit to
drive (FTM) (pdf)
](https://www.gov.ie/pdf/?file=https://assets.gov.ie/292514/e5291b34-d4e7-43b2-aea3-ea5a832849ad.pdf#page=null)
now.

In this case, your spouse, civil partner, or cohabitant **cannot** accompany
you free of charge when travelling.

###  **Accessible public transport**

Read about [ accessible public transport for people with a disability or
reduced mobility ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/travel-and-
recreation/public-transport/travelling-publictransport-with-disability/) .

##  Taxis

Licenced and regulated by the National Transport Authority, [ taxis, hackneys
and limousines ](/en/travel-and-recreation/public-transport/regulation-of-
taxis-and-small-public-service-vehicles/) are available across Ireland.

You can check if your driver is licenced using the [ TFI Driver Check App
](https://www.transportforireland.ie/getting-around/by-taxi/driver-check-app/)
.

Use the [ Taxi Fare Estimator ](https://www.transportforireland.ie/fares/taxi-
fare-estimator/) to estimate your taxi fare. The fares calculated are
approximate and depend on traffic.

###  How do I pay for a taxi in Ireland?

Taxis in Ireland must accept credit and debit card payments (for example Visa,
Mastercard, American Express) as well as cash. You can choose how you want to
pay. Taxi drivers cannot add a surcharge on any card payments.

##  Driving

###  **Driving licences**

You must have a valid driving licence to drive in Ireland.

If you have a valid full foreign driving licence, you can drive on this for up
to 12 months while visiting Ireland.

If you have returned to live in Ireland permanently, you should [ exchange
your foreign driving licence to an Irish driving licence
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/travel-and-recreation/motoring/driver-
licensing/exchanging-foreign-driving-permit/) or start the [ driving test
process ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/travel-and-
recreation/motoring/driver-licensing/learning-to-drive/) here in Ireland.

Only driving licences issued by [ EU/EEA countries
](https://www.ndls.ie/holders-of-foreign-licences.html#to-apply-to-exchange-a-
foreign-driving-licence-issued-by-a-member-state-of-the-european-union-
european-economic-area) , the UK, and certain [ recognised states
](https://www.ndls.ie/holders-of-foreign-licences.html#to-apply-to-exchange-a-
foreign-driving-licence-issued-by-a-recognised-state) can be exchanged for an
Irish driving licence.

**Reduced Essential Driver Training**

If you cannot exchange your foreign driving licence (for example, if you have
a drivers licence from the United States), you may only have to do 6 Essential
Driver Training (EDT) lessons.

This applies if you:

  * Have a full foreign driving licence 
  * Have had your licence for at least 2 years 
  * Have a licence that is expired less than 6 months 
  * Are resident in Ireland 
  * Have an Irish learner permit 

You can also apply to be exempted from the usual 6 month waiting period before
first time learner permit holders can sit a driving test. Download this [
explainer from the Road Safety Authority (RSA) (pdf)
](https://www.ndls.ie/images/Documents/Flyers/166425%20RSA%20Foreign%20Licence%20\(EDT\)_WEB.PDF)
for information on the reduced EDT programme.

To apply, you need to complete the RSA’s [ application form for Reduced
Essential Driver Training (pdf).
](https://www.ndls.ie/images/Documents/Forms/166459%20RSA%20EDT%20App%20Form_HR_WEB.PDF)

**Can I renew or replace my Irish driving licence when living abroad?**

You must be normally resident in Ireland at least 185 days in a calendar year
to renew or replace your Irish driver’s licence.

If your Irish driving licence expires, you have up to 10 years from the date
of expiry to renew your licence. If you have a learner permit, you have up to
5 years from the date of expiry.

If you are normally resident in Ireland but are currently working on a fixed
contract or studying abroad, you can [ apply online ](https://www.ndls.ie/how-
to-apply/applying-online.html) to renew or replace your Irish driving licence.
Read more about [ renewing ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/travel-and-
recreation/motoring/driver-licensing/renewing-a-full-driving-licence/) or [
replacing your Irish driving licence
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/travel-and-recreation/motoring/driver-
licensing/replacing-a-lost-or-stolen-irish-driving-licence/) .

**Motor Insurance, National Car Test (NCT) and Tax**

You must [ insure ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/returning-to-
ireland/getting-around-in-ireland/getting-motor-insurance-on-return-to-
ireland/) and [ tax ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/travel-and-
recreation/motoring/motor-tax-and-insurance/motor-tax-rates/) your vehicle
before you can drive in Ireland. Most cars that are 4 years or older, must
also have a valid [ National Car Test (NCT)
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/travel-and-recreation/vehicle-
standards/national-car-test/) .

Insurers will take [ overseas driving experience
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/returning_to_ireland/getting_around_in_ireland/Getting_motor_insurance_on_return_to_Ireland.html#lbc52a)
into account if you can prove that you have driven without any accidents or
claims abroad. In general, motor insurers will consider your no claims history
from the EEA and Switzerland, the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand,
Japan, Canada, South Africa, and the United States.

Many insurers will not give you a [ no claims discount
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/returning_to_ireland/getting_around_in_ireland/Getting_motor_insurance_on_return_to_Ireland.html#lf23f2)
if you have been uninsured for 2 or more years, or if you have been insured
abroad.

**Car rental in Ireland**

[ Renting a car in Ireland
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/consumer_affairs/motoring/renting_a_car.en.html)
can be a useful way to travel without having to invest in permanent ownership.

Car sharing has also become a popular mode of transport in Ireland in recent
years. This is where you rent vehicles from car rental companies on a pay-as-
you-go basis. You normally need to use an App on your phone to access car
sharing services.

**Buying a car in Ireland**

Read our information on [ buying a new
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/consumer/cars/buying-a-new-car/) or [
used car ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/consumer/cars/buying-a-used-
car/) in Ireland.

##  Importing a vehicle

To [ import a car or any other type of vehicle to Ireland ](/en/moving-
country/moving-to-ireland/coming-to-live-in-ireland/importing-car-into-
ireland/) , you will need to meet certain legal requirements.

If you bring your vehicle to Ireland, you have to register the vehicle at a [
National Car Testing Service (NCTS) ](https://www.ncts.ie/1195/) centre within
30 days of the car arriving in Ireland and you may have to pay [ Vehicle
Registration Tax (VRT) ](https://www.revenue.ie/en/importing-vehicles-duty-
free-allowances/guide-to-vrt/vehicle-registration-tax/index.aspx) . You must
make an appointment with the NCTS within 7 days of the vehicle's arrival in
Ireland.

You can [ claim a relief from VRT ](https://www.revenue.ie/en/importing-
vehicles-duty-free-allowances/guide-to-vrt/reliefs-and-exemptions/transfer-of-
residence.aspx) if you are returning to Ireland permanently and you were using
the vehicle for more than 6 months before you moved to Ireland. In this case,
you must still register your vehicle, but you will not have to pay VRT.

##  Cycling

[ Cycling
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/travel_and_recreation/cycling/) is an
affordable, healthy, and environmentally friendly mode of transport.

A tax break is available to employees who buy new bikes and equipment under
the [ Cycle to Work Scheme ](/en/travel-and-recreation/cycling/cycle-to-work-
scheme/) . You can also use [ bike sharing schemes ](/en/travel-and-
recreation/cycling/overview-cycling#lc562c) to combine public transport with
bike hire when you commute to work.

When you return to Ireland, it's important you understand the [ laws on
cycling ](/en/travel-and-recreation/cycling/cycling-offences/) and the rules
regarding [ bike lights ](/en/travel-and-recreation/cycling/lighting-of-
bicycles-in-ireland/) .
