##  Introduction

Disputes between landlords and tenants can often be resolved informally
between the people involved. However, sometimes a third party is needed to
hear both sides and recommend a resolution. This page outlines how to deal
with disputes in residential tenancies, and where to get help.

Most [ private residential tenancies ](/en/housing/renting-a-home/tenants-
rights-and-responsibilities/types-of-tenancy/) are covered by residential
tenancies legislation. [ Approved housing bodies ](/en/housing/local-
authority-and-social-housing/approved-housing-bodies/) and [ student specific
accommodation ](https://www.rtb.ie/registration-and-
compliance/registrations/student-specific-accommodation) are covered by the
legislation and come under the remit of the Residential Tenancies Board (RTB).
All private residential tenancies, housing association tenancies and student
accommodation tenancies should be [ registered ](/en/housing/renting-a-
home/landlords-rights-and-responsibilities/registering-a-tenancy/) every year
with the [ RTB ](/en/housing/renting-a-home/resolving-disputes/residential-
tenancies-board/) . The RTB provides a [ dispute resolution service
](/en/housing/renting-a-home/disputes-between-landlords-and-tenants#l13c85) .

Residential tenancies legislation does not apply to [ tenants who rent a room
in their landlord’s home ](/en/housing/renting-a-home/tenants-rights-and-
responsibilities/sharing-accommodation-with-your-landlord/) or to tenants of [
local authorities ](/en/housing/local-authority-and-social-housing/) .  

##  Dealing with disputes

If there is a dispute between you and your landlord, you should first try to
resolve it yourselves. If your landlord is an approved housing body, you
should use its complaints procedure.

Make sure that you are aware of your [ rights and responsibilities
](/en/housing/renting-a-home/tenants-rights-and-responsibilities/tenants-
rights-and-obligations/) and that your facts are correct. It may be useful to
write to your landlord giving details of your complaints and providing any
evidence needed, such as photographs or receipts for repairs. Keep a record of
all contact between you and your landlord, including copies of all
correspondence and documents.

If you cannot resolve the dispute in this way, you may need outside help.

  * For any problems with your tenancy, you can contact [ Threshold ](https://threshold.ie/) . Threshold provides free, independent, confidential advice to anyone in Ireland with tenancy problems. 
  * If your dispute is about your home not meeting [ minimum physical standards ](/en/housing/renting-a-home/tenants-rights-and-responsibilities/minimum-standards-for-rented-homes/) , you can complain to the Environmental Health Service of your [ local authority ](http://www.housing.gov.ie/node/19) , which is responsible for ensuring that private rented accommodation [ meets these standards ](http://www.threshold.ie/advice/dealing-with-problems-during-your-tenancy/standards-and-repairs/)
  * If your dispute is about the landlord’s failure to give you a [ rent book ](/en/housing/renting-a-home/tenants-rights-and-responsibilities/rent-books/) , receipts or statements of rent paid, you can complain to the housing department of your [ local authority ](http://www.housing.gov.ie/node/19) , which is responsible for enforcing the [ regulations on rent books ](https://threshold.ie/faq/how-can-i-get-a-rent-book/)
  * If your dispute still cannot be resolved, you may decide to take it to the RTB which has a dispute resolution service 

##  RTB's dispute resolution service

[ The Residential Tenancies Board (RTB) ](https://www.rtb.ie/) offers a
dispute resolution service to landlords and tenants. Most of the process is
online, with the majority of hearings held virtually and mediation often
completed by phone. Any agreement reached with its help, or adjudicated by it,
is legally binding. Landlords, tenants or other people who have been directly
affected, such as neighbours, can begin the process. **Landlords must be
registered with the RTB to use the service but tenants can use it even if
their landlord has not registered the tenancy.**

The service covers disputes about deposits, lease terms, termination of
tenancies, rent arrears, market rents, complaints by neighbours, breaches of
statutory obligations by either landlord or tenant and any other matters
related to the tenancy. It can also deal with disputes about terms of a lease
or other tenancy agreements that are not specified in the Residential
Tenancies Act 2004. **You do not need legal representation when taking a case
to the RTB.**

Since, 27 October 2022 the default process for dispute resolution is
mediation. This means that the RTB now prioritises resolving disputes through
its mediation service.

###  Time limits for referring disputes to the RTB

Certain types of dispute should be referred to the RTB within a set timeframe.
You must refer:

  * Disputes about rent to the RTB within 28 days of the tenancy ending 
  * Disputes about [ notices of termination ](/en/housing/renting-a-home/tenants-rights-and-responsibilities/if-your-landlord-wants-you-to-leave/) to the RTB within 90 days of receiving the notice, as long as you have kept your [ tenant’s obligations ](/en/housing/renting-a-home/tenants-rights-and-responsibilities/tenants-rights-and-obligations/) . If you have broken these obligations the notice period is 28 days. 
  * Disputes about [ rent increases ](/en/housing/renting-a-home/landlords-rights-and-responsibilities/rent-increases-in-private-rented-housing/) to the RTB either: 
    * Before the rent increase is due to take effect (you must get at least 90 days’ notice of a rent increase) 
    * Within 28 days of receiving formal notice of the new rent (whichever is later) 

The RTB may extend these limits in exceptional circumstances.

##  How the process works

There are 2 stages to the [ RTB’s dispute resolution process
](https://www.rtb.ie/dispute-resolution) :

  * **Stage 1** is confidential mediation or adjudication. The landlord and tenant can decide which method they prefer. If either side does not accept the mediator’s or adjudicator’s decision, the dispute can be appealed to Stage 2. 
  * **Stage 2** is a public hearing by a 3-person Tenancy Tribunal. This appeal must be made within 10 days of the mediator’s or adjudicator’s decision. 

###  Determination orders

When a mediated agreement is reached, or the adjudicator or Tribunal make a
decision, the RTB issues a determination order. A determination order gives
the outcome of the case and details the conditions that each party must meet,
and by when. The RTB publishes all determination orders. Determination orders
are enforced through the District Court. You can appeal a Tribunal decision to
the High Court, but only on a point of law.

If a determination order states that a tenancy should end between 30 October
2022 and 31 March 2023, the tenancy termination date will be postponed until
April at the earliest. This is because an eviction ban was in place at this
time.

###  Mediation

Mediation means that an impartial mediator helps the parties come to an
agreement together. Mediation can only go ahead if the RTB thinks it is the
most appropriate way to resolve the dispute and if both parties agree to it.
You can opt for face-to-face mediation or telephone mediation.

  * In telephone mediation, the mediator contacts each side individually in a series of telephone calls. You will not have to speak to the other person involved in the dispute. 
  * In face-to-face mediation, the mediator arranges a private hearing, where each party can state their case 

You do not need evidence for the mediation process. You submit a [ Mediation
Position Statement (pdf)
](https://www.rtb.ie/images/uploads/forms/Mediation_Position_Statement_\(English\).pdf)
outlining:

  * What you hope to get from the mediation process 
  * The issues you feel have prevented the issue from being resolved so far 

You can also send documents that highlight these issues. The mediator uses
your statement and documents to understand what is important to you in the
dispute.

The mediator aims to help both sides to reach a resolution that is acceptable
to everyone. A report of the mediation is sent to each side, along with
letters accepting or rejecting the proposed agreement. There is a cooling-off
period of 10 days, after which the parties must return either the acceptance
letter or the rejection letter to the RTB. If both accept the mediation
agreement, it becomes a legally binding determination order of the RTB. The
RTB does not publish the outcome of mediated cases. Find out more about the [
mediation process on the RTB’s website ](https://www.rtb.ie/dispute-
resolution/mediation) .

###  Adjudication

If the two parties do not agree to the mediation process, or if the RTB
decides that mediation is not the best option, the case goes to adjudication.
This means that an adjudicator makes a decision, which may or may not reflect
any agreement reached between the parties. The parties then decide if they are
willing to accept this decision.

Adjudication hearings are held online, but you can request a face-to-face
hearing. The [ RTB’s Guide to Virtual Dispute Resolution Hearings (pdf)
](https://www.rtb.ie/images/uploads/general/Guide_to_Virtual_Dispute_Resolution_Hearings_%284%29.pdf)
has useful information about the online process.

An adjudicator is appointed to investigate the case fully. You can send
documentary evidence to support your claim to the RTB. This should be sent at
least 5 days before your hearing. The [ RTB’s Guide to Evidence (pdf)
](https://www.rtb.ie/images/uploads/forms/RTB%E2%80%99s_Guide_to_Evidence_Stage_%28Revised_Oct_2022%29_2.pdf)
has useful information about types of evidence and how to submit them.

At the hearing both parties will have a chance to present their side of the
dispute using the documentary evidence they sent. Based on the evidence of the
two parties, the adjudicator decides how the dispute is to be resolved. The
adjudicator's report is sent to both parties in the case, along with letters
of acceptance and rejection, one of which must be filled out and returned to
the RTB within 10 days. If both parties accept the adjudication decision, it
becomes a legally binding determination order of the RTB. Read more about the
[ RTB’s ajudication services and how they work ](https://www.rtb.ie/dispute-
resolution/adjudication) .

###  Tenancy Tribunal

The Tenancy Tribunal is the second stage of the RTB's dispute resolution
service. The Tribunal is made up of 3 people from the RTB’s Dispute Resolution
Committee. A dispute can be referred to the Tenancy Tribunal for any of the
following reasons:

  * If an agreement cannot be reached using mediation 
  * If either party wants to appeal an adjudicator's decision 
  * If any of the parties request a Tribunal hearing 
  * If the RTB refers the dispute directly to the Tribunal, for example, where there appears to be imminent risk of damage to the property or danger to the parties involved 

If your case is to be heard by the Tribunal, the RTB will notify you at least
21 days before the hearing. They will tell you the date, time and purpose of
the hearing. You can submit additional evidence about your case to the RTB
before the Tribunal hearing.

Tenancy Tribunal hearings are mainly held online. However, the RTB can
schedule face-to-face hearings, if needed. At the hearing you will have the
chance to present your case. The hearing is not formal and you can have a
family member or friend with you, if you like. Legal representation is not
needed at hearings, but you can arrange to have it if you want. Tenancy
Tribunal hearings are open to the public and the RTB has [ Guidelines for
Members of the Public Attending a Hearing (pdf)
](https://www.rtb.ie/images/uploads/general/Guidelines_for_Public_Attending_a_Hearing_%282%29.pdf)
. The RTB also has information on [ Tribunal Procedures (pdf)
](https://www.rtb.ie/images/uploads/general/RTB_Tribunal_Procedures_Virtual_Hearings.pdf)
, as well as a [ Guide to Virtual Dispute Resolution Hearings (pdf)
](https://www.rtb.ie/images/uploads/general/Guide_to_Virtual_Dispute_Resolution_Hearings_%284%29.pdf)
to help you with the process.

The Tribunal will hear your dispute and make a decision on it based on the
evidence. The decision of the Tenancy Tribunal is issued to all parties as a
determination order of the RTB and is legally binding. You can view [
determination orders on the RTB website ](https://www.rtb.ie/dispute-case-
outcomes) . Tribunal decisions can only be appealed to the [ High Court
](/en/justice/courts-system/high-court/) on a point of law and the appeal must
be lodged within 21 days. Read more about [ making an appeal to a Tenancy
Tribunal on the RTB website ](https://www.rtb.ie/dispute-resolution/tribunals)
.

###  Enforcement of determination orders

The District Court is responsible for the enforcement of RTB determination
orders (previously this work was done by the Circuit Court). If any of the
parties do not comply with a determination order, they can be reported to the
RTB, which can apply for a District Court Order directing them to comply. You
can also apply to the District Court directly if you are affected by someone's
failure to comply with an order. Read more about [ enforcement of orders
](https://www.rtb.ie/dispute-resolution-services/enforcement-of-determination-
orders) .

##  Investigations and sanctions

If you do not want to want to go through the RTB’s dispute resolution process,
but want to report an issue about a landlord breaking residential tenancies
legislation, you can contact the RTB who will investigate certain issues and
sanction the landlord if necessary. The RTB will investigate if a landlord:

  * Does not comply with [ Rent Pressure Zone ](https://www.rtb.ie/beginning-a-tenancy/setting-rent) rules - including rules about rent increases in RPZ’s and RPZ exemptions 
  * Does not register tenancies with the RTB within 1 month of the tenancy beginning 
  * Does not notify the RTB of changes to a tenancy within a month of the changes taking effect. For example changes to the rent and tenant details. 
  * Does not offer a tenancy back to a tenant if the property becomes available to rent again, and the tenant was originally asked to leave the property because the landlord was selling the property, changing its use, substantially refurbishing it, or because they needed it for themselves or an immediate family member 
  * Provides false or misleading reasons for terminating a tenancy 
  * Looks for a deposit and advance payment of more than 2 month’s rent 

You can contact the RTB’s Investigations and Sanctions Information Unit on
0818 776297 to discuss your concerns about a landlord who is not complying
with these rules, or you can email investigations@rtb.ie. Alternatively, you
can make a formal complaint about the landlord using the RTB [ Sanctions and
Alleged Breach Complaint form (pdf)
](https://www.rtb.ie/images/uploads/forms/Complaint_form_%28Revised_July_2022%29_v.6.pdf)
.

If you email or phone the Investigations and Sanctions Unit, your name will
not be given to the landlord, and you will not receive any updates from the
RTB about your issue. However, if you make a formal complaint this will be
sent to the landlord with your name, and the RTB will also keep you updated
about the investigation. Find out more about the [ investigations process on
the RTB website ](https://www.rtb.ie/registration-and-
compliance/investigations-sanctions) .

The RTB has information on the [ differences between the dispute resolution
process and the complaints process ](https://www.rtb.ie/dispute-
resolution/the-difference-between-submitting-a-complaint-and-a-dispute) , if
you are unsure about which way to resolve your issue.

These [ additional powers ](https://www.rtb.ie/registration-and-
compliance/investigations-sanctions) to investigate and sanction landlords
were introduced under the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act and commenced
in July 2019.
