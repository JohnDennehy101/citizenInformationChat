criteria for both Springboard+ and your chosen course.

##  If you were previously self-employed

You are eligible for Springboard+ if you were previously self-employed but are

You must meet the [ residency criteria
](https://springboardcourses.ie/eligibility) and provide a letter or statement
from Revenue stating that you are no longer trading (or a similar letter from
your former accountant).

An ICT skills conversion course is when you retrain to start a career in the
technology sector.

If you were getting Jobseeker's Benefit or Jobseeker's Allowance for at least
9 of the previous 12 months, you may get a [ Back to Education Allowance
](/en/social-welfare/back-to-education/back-to-education-allowance/) while
participating on a one-year, full-time ICT skills conversion course.

You are not eligible for a 2-year part-time ICT conversion course if:

  * You are getting a jobseeker’s payment (including Farm Assist) 
  * You are a qualified adult of working age on someone else’s social welfare payment. 

##  Springboard+ fees

###  Unemployed people

You do not have to pay any course fees or charges if you are unemployed.

If you take up a Springboard+ course, you can keep your existing social
welfare payment if you continue to fulfil the conditions for the payment. If
you have started a course and lose your qualifying social welfare payment, you
can continue your course.

If you are getting a jobseeker’s payment and participating on a part-time
Springboard+ course, you will continue to get your jobseeker’s payment under
the [ Part-Time Education Option (PTEO) ](/en/social-welfare/back-to-
education/part-time-education-option/) .

If you are getting a jobseeker’s payment and you are on a full-time course,
you may have the option to transfer to a [ Back to Education Allowance (BTEA)
](/en/social-welfare/back-to-education/back-to-education-allowance/) .

If you take up a job while on a course, Springboard+ will fund the fees for
the full academic year.

If your course extends into another academic year(s), the fees will be decided
by your college.

###  Employed people

If you are employed, you must pay 10% towards the course fee at Level 7, 8 and
9 on the NFQ. However, Level 6 courses are free.

If you are getting the [ Working Family Payment (WFP) ](/en/social-
welfare/families-and-children/working-family-payment/) , or if you are on a [
Community Employment Scheme ](/en/employment/unemployment-and-
redundancy/employment-support-schemes/community-employment-scheme/) at the
start of the course, you will not have to pay the 10% course fee contribution.

###  Recent graduates

Recent graduates must pay 10% of the tuition fee for ICT skills conversion
courses.

##  How to apply for Springboard+

Applications for Springboard+ 2024-2025 are now open.

To apply for a Springboard+ course, you choose the course(s) you are
interested in on the [ Springboard+ website
](https://springboardcourses.ie/search) and apply online.
