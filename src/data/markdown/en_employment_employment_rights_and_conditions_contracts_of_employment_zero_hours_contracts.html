##  What are zero-hours contracts?

A zero-hours contract is where you are available for work but your hours of
work are not specified under your [ employment contract
](/en/employment/employment-rights-and-conditions/contracts-of-
employment/contract-of-employment/) .

A zero-hours contract requires you to be available for a certain number of
hours a week, or when required, or both. You are not guaranteed a set number
of hours.

Employees on zero-hours contracts are protected by the [ Organisation of
Working Time Act 1997
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1997/en/act/pub/0020/index.html) . However,
this does not apply to casual work.

The laws on zero-hours contracts are set out in the [ Employment
(Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2018
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2018/act/38/enacted/en/print.html) . This
Act strengthens your employment rights in several areas, including banning
zero-hours contracts in most cases.

##  Ban on zero-hours contracts

Zero-hours contracts are banned in most cases but there are some exceptions.

Zero-hours contracts are allowed in the following circumstances:

  * Work of a casual nature 
  * Work done in emergency situations 
  * Short-term relief to cover routine absences 

###  Examples

A member of staff in a care facility must accompany a resident to hospital at
short notice. An appropriate substitute worker can be called in to cover under
a zero-hours contract.

Schools keep a panel of teachers to provide substitute cover for the
unexpected absence of a regular member of the teaching staff.

###  **Banded hours**

Where your current employment contract does not accurately reflect the average
hours per week that you actually work over a 12-month period, you are entitled
to a banded contract.

A banded contract gives you the right to work an average of the hours in your
specified band for 12 months. There are 8 bands covering a certain number of
hours per week (for example, 6-11 or 11-16 hours per week).

You can find more information in our document on [ the working week
](/en/employment/employment-rights-and-conditions/hours-of-work/working-
hours/) on how to request a banded hours contract and how to complain if you
feel your request was unreasonably refused.

##  Right to a minimum payment

You must get a minimum payment if you are called in to work but sent home
without work. You must get pay for 25% of the possible hours or for 15 hours,
whichever is less. This rule does not apply to emergencies, exceptional
circumstances or short-term relief.

Your pay should be calculated as either 3 times the national minimum wage or 3
times the minimum hourly rate in an [ Employment Regulation Order (ERO)
](/en/employment/employment-rights-and-conditions/industrial-relations-and-
trade-unions/employment-agreements-and-orders/) (if applicable).

An employee under a zero-hours contract who works less than 25% of their
potential hours in any week should be paid. The level of pay depends on
whether you got some work or no work.

###  You got no work

If you got no work, you should be paid as if you worked 25% of the possible
available hours or paid for 15 hours, whichever is less.

####  Example 1

You are required to be available for 20 hours per week, but you got no work.
You are entitled to be paid for either:

  * 15 hours 
  * 25% of the 20 hours (5 hours) 

You entitled to whichever amount is less. In this case, 5 hours is less.

###  You got some work

If you got some work, you should be paid for 25% of the possible available
hours or for 15 hours, whichever is less.

####  Example 2

You are required to be available for 20 hours per week and you got 3 hours’
work. You are entitled to be paid for 2 hours’ pay, to bring you up to 25% of
the contract hours.

###  Calculating the minimum payment

€11.30 per hour is the [ national minimum wage ](/en/employment/employment-
rights-and-conditions/pay-and-employment/minimum-wage/) . Alternatively, you
could substitute the ERO hourly rate if this applies to your job.

**Example 1:** You got no work (€11.30 x 3 times x 5 hours) = €169.50

**Example 2:** You got 3 hours’ work(€11.30 x 3 times x 2 hours) = €67.80

This minimum payment rate does not apply if you are on call.

The rules on how to calculate these minimum payments are set out in the [
Employment (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2018
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2018/act/38/enacted/en/print.html) .

##  Right to banded hours

If your employment contract does not state the average hours per week that you
actually work over 12 months, you are entitled to a banded contract.

There are 8 bands covering a certain number of hours a week (for example, 6 to
11 hours or 11 to 16 hours a week).

Once you are placed on a particular band, you have the right to work an
average of those hours for 12 months.

You can find more information about [ the working week
](/en/employment/employment-rights-and-conditions/hours-of-work/working-
hours/) , including how to ask for a banded hours contract and how to complain
if your request was unreasonably refused.

##  How to make a complaint

You can enforce your legal rights by referring a dispute with your employer to
the Workplace Relations Commission. You must use the [ online complaint form
](https://www.workplacerelations.ie/en/Publications_Forms/Workplace_Relations_Complaint_Form1.pdf)
on [ workplacerelations.ie
](https://www.workplacerelations.ie/en/Complaints_Disputes/Refer_a_Dispute_Make_a_Complaint/)
.

You should do this within 6 months of the dispute taking place. The time limit
can be extended for up to a further 6 months if there was reasonable cause for
the delay.
