##  Introduction

This page provides information on the functions and duties of the different
people you are likely to encounter in a courtroom.

##  The judge

The judge in an Irish courtroom usually sits on a raised platform at the top
of the court and wears a white collar and a black gown.

The judge is in charge of the courtroom and they must make sure that the trial
is fair. They settle any legal argument and direct the jury.

If there is no [ jury
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/justice/courtroom/jury/) in a case, it
is the judge who decides which party wins and which party loses. They listen
to the evidence of both sides and to the submissions of the [ barristers
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/justice/courtroom/barristers/) (or [
solicitors
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/justice/courtroom/solicitors/) ). The
judge may ask questions of any [ witness
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/justice/witnesses/) and of the
barristers (or solicitors).

If there is a jury, they usually decide the outcome of the case. The jury in a
[ criminal trial ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/justice/criminal-
law/criminal-trial/criminal-trial/) has the responsibility of deciding whether
the person accused of the crime is guilty or not guilty. If the defendant is
found guilty the judge decides the sentence.

You can read more about the [ role of the judge
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/justice/courtroom/judge/) .

##  Barristers

A barrister (also called "counsel") is a type of lawyer who specialises in
court advocacy and giving legal opinions. In court, their role is to argue
their case and examine any witnesses. They sit facing the judge and the
witnesses, and wear black gowns.

Barristers are engaged by solicitors to work on a case. When you contact a
solicitor for legal advice, your solicitor may recommend that a barrister be
engaged to provide services.

You can read more about [ barristers
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/justice/courtroom/barristers/) .

##  Solicitors

A solicitor is a type of lawyer. A solicitor may give you legal advice about
taking or defending a case. If you are involved in a court case, your
solicitor will manage the case and represent you when dealing with the other
party. For example, your solicitor will send letters to the other side on your
behalf. Your solicitor will file all of the necessary court documents and
contact the [ witnesses ](/en/justice/witnesses/being-a-witness/) for the
case.

Solicitors do not have to wear any special clothes when in court. If there is
a barrister involved in the case, the solicitor will usually sit facing the
barrister in the bench under the [ judge ](/en/justice/courtroom/judge/) . If
the barrister needs a matter to be clarified, they can then lean over to ask
the solicitor.

If it is necessary to involve a [ barrister
](/en/justice/courtroom/barristers/) in the case, your solicitor will brief
the barrister by sending them all of the necessary documents and information.

Your solicitor may also actually represent you in court, although in the [
High Court ](/en/justice/courts-system/high-court/) and the [ Supreme Court
](/en/justice/courts-system/supreme-court/) , a barrister will usually be
engaged.

](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/justice/courtroom/solicitors/) .

##  The jury

The jury consists of 12 members of the public who sit in a box to one side of
the judge. One of the jurors is selected as a foreman of the jury by the
members of the jury before the case starts. They act as an informal
chairperson and spokesperson for the jury.

You are entitled to be tried by jury unless the alleged offence is a minor one
or one that is being tried in the [ Special Criminal Court
](/en/justice/courts-system/special-criminal-court/) . However, a jury is not
required in every legal case. There is a jury in some civil cases such as
defamation and assault cases. However, for the majority of civil cases such as
personal injuries actions and family law cases, there is no jury - it is the [
judge ](/en/justice/courtroom/judge/) who decides the outcome.

The jurors are charged with the responsibility of deciding whether, on the
facts of the case, a person is guilty or not guilty of the offence for which
they have been charged.

The jury must reach its verdict by considering only the [ evidence
](/en/justice/evidence/evidence-introduction/) introduced in court and the
directions of the judge. The jury does not interpret the law. It follows the
directions of the judge as regards legal matters.

The jury has no role in [ sentencing ](/en/justice/criminal-law/criminal-
trial/sentence/) . This decision is left up to the judge following submissions
made by both sides.

You can read more about [ the jury ](/en/justice/courtroom/jury/) , or about [
jury service ](/en/justice/courtroom/jury-service/) .

##  Witnesses

Witnesses are people who have been called to give [ evidence
](/en/justice/evidence/evidence-introduction/) in court. The witness's name is
called and they go into the witness box at one side of the judge. They stand
in the witness box to repeat the oath or affirmation and then sit down.

The witness is then asked a series of questions by the [ barristers
](/en/justice/courtroom/barristers/) (or [ solicitors
](/en/justice/courtroom/solicitors/) ) in the case. The witness's function is
to give evidence to the court. For example, the witness may have seen a
robbery take place and may be able to tell the court what they saw. This
evidence may help the [ judge ](/en/justice/courtroom/judge/) or the [ jury
](/en/justice/courtroom/jury/) to make its decision.

](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/justice/witnesses/) .

##  The court registrar

The court registrar (or court clerk) usually sits on a slightly raised
platform below the [ judge ](/en/justice/courtroom/judge/) facing the court.
They do not wear any special clothes in court, although sometimes in the High
Court if the registrar happens to also be a [ barrister
](/en/justice/courtroom/barristers/) , they will wear barrister's robes.

Court registrars are public servants and they are recruited directly from [
the civil service. ](/en/government-in-ireland/how-government-works/national-
government/the-civil-service/)

The registrar's main function is to assist the judge by:

  * Calling out each case as they start so that the parties can identify themselves to the court 
  * Swearing in the witnesses 
  * Swearing in the jury and recording the decision in the case 
  * Being in charge of court documents and exhibits 
  * Drafting the orders that the judge has made during a day in court and keeping a record of those orders 
  * Generally dealing with the administration necessary for the smooth running of the courts 

##  Judicial assistant

The judicial assistant works with the judge. They do legal research for the
judge.

They also announce when the judge enters or leaves the courtroom (usually by
saying ‘all rise’).

##  Public and press

Most courtrooms are open to the public and anyone can come in and watch.

If the courtroom is not open to the public there will be a sign on the door
reading ‘ _in camera_ ’. This means that the case is heard in private and only
people who are involved in the case are allowed in. This is done to protect
the privacy of the people in court, usually in family law matters and some
criminal cases (for instance rape cases or cases in the juvenile courts).

The members of the public attending a court case may include reporters
employed by newspapers, radio, television, or legal reports companies.

Everything that is said in court is recorded digitally by a Digital Audio
Recording (DAR) box.

##  What to expect when you go to court

If you are going to court, you are not expected to know all the formalities of
the courtroom and some of these will be explained to you during the case. For
example, the judge or clerk will tell you where to sit when you arrive, and
you will be told when you can leave.

Some of the procedures in a courtroom include:

  * Standing when the judge is entering or leaving the court, or when you are speaking to the court 
  * Addressing the judge as ‘judge’ when you are speaking to them 
  * Turning off your phone or switching it to silent mode, and not taking pictures or recording videos during the case 
  * Not raising your voice or interrupting others, and only speaking when directed to do so 

You are allowed to take notes during the case if you wish, and you can ask the
judge for a break if you need one.

You can read more about [ what to expect in a courtroom
](https://courts.ie/what-expect-courtroom) on the Courts Service website. You
can also watch a [ 'Who is in the courtroom' video ](https://courts.ie/who-
courtroom) that explains the roles of the people that work in the courtroom
during a criminal trial.
