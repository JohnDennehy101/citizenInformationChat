##  What is an e-bike?

An e-bike is a pedal-assisted electric bike. _Pedal-assisted_ means the
electric motor stops providing power when you stop pedalling.

[ E-bikes are treated the same as conventional bikes ](/en/travel-and-
recreation/cycling/overview-cycling/) under Irish law. You do not need a
licence to ride one and your e-bike does not need to be registered, taxed or
insured.

While it is not illegal for children to ride e-bikes in public places, young
children should always be supervised.

###  **Technical requirements**

An e-bike used on a public road must have:

  * A maximum power output of 250 watts or less 
  * A motor that cuts off once you stop pedalling 
  * A maximum speed of 25km per hour 
  * Front and rear lights (switched on during lighting-up hours and darkness) 

Cargo bikes which meet these exact requirements are also classified as
e-bikes.

An e-bike that does not meet these technical standards is categorised as an
e-moped.

recreation/e-scooters-e-bikes-and-e-mopeds/e-mopeds/) .

personal-transportation#:~:text=No%20front%20lamp,warden%20stop%20sign.)
between €40 and €80.

You must not ride your e-bike under the influence of alcohol or drugs. Riding
under the influence can result in a court appearance and a fine of up to
€2,000.

##  Safety tips

It is important to look after your safety and the safety of others on the
road. Follow these safety tips when cycling your e-bike:

  * Take weather conditions into consideration. 
  * Be seen; wear reflective (hi-vis) clothing and personal protection gear. 
  * You should wear a helmet, although this is not legally required. 
  * Do not use headphones. 
  * Be mindful of others on the road. 

##  Buying an e-bike

Only buy an e-bike from a reputable retailer or distributor. You can use the [
Cycle to Work Scheme ](/en/travel-and-recreation/cycling/cycle-to-work-
scheme/) to help pay for a new e-bike.

Check that the e-bike is [ CE marked ](https://ec.europa.eu/growth/single-
market/ce-marking/) . It should have the manufacturer's details, manufacture
date and serial number on its CE plate.

The retailer should give you a declaration of conformity when you buy it.
