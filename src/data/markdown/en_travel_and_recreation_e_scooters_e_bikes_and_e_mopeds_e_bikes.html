##  What is an e-bike?

An e-bike is a pedal-assisted electric bike. _Pedal-assisted_ means the
electric motor stops providing power when you stop pedalling.

[ E-bikes are treated the same as conventional bikes ](/en/travel-and-
recreation/cycling/overview-cycling/) under Irish law. You do not need a
licence to ride one and your e-bike does not need to be registered, taxed or
insured.

While it is not illegal for children to ride e-bikes in public places, young
children should always be supervised.

###  **Technical requirements**

An e-bike used on a public road must have:

  * A maximum power output of 250 watts or less 
  * A motor that cuts off once you stop pedalling 
  * A maximum speed of 25km per hour 
  * Front and rear lights (switched on during lighting-up hours and darkness) 

Cargo bikes which meet these exact requirements are also classified as
e-bikes.

An e-bike that does not meet these technical standards is categorised as an
e-moped.

You can read more about [ e-mopeds and the law ](/en/travel-and-
recreation/e-scooters-e-bikes-and-e-mopeds/e-mopeds/) .

You can also see a [ table setting out technical definitions and requirements
for e-scooter, e-bikes and e-mopeds (pdf).
](https://assets.gov.ie/293234/b26becea-4b39-4055-ab69-affe8264459e.pdf)

##  Are e-bikes legal on public roads in Ireland?

E-bikes can be legally used on Irish roads since 20 May 2024 under the [ Road
Traffic and Roads Act 2023
](https://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2023/act/16/enacted/en/html) .

##  Rules on using e-bikes

###  **Where you can use an e-bike**

  * E-bikes can be used on local, regional, and national roads. They cannot be used on motorways. 
  * E-bikes cannot be used on footpaths or in pedestrianised areas. 
  * You can use cycle and bus lanes. 
  * You must drive on the left, including in cycle and bus lanes. 

###  Rules of the road

  * Follow the [ rules of the road ](https://www.rsa.ie/services/learner-drivers/resources/rules-of-the-road) , especially for traffic lights, pedestrian crossings, and zebra crossings. 
  * Follow all traffic signs in the same way they apply to cyclists. 
  * You must not hold or use your mobile phone when cycling an e-bike. 
  * Follow signals given by a Garda or school warden. 

Read more about [ the laws on cycling in Ireland ](/en/travel-and-
recreation/cycling/cycling-offences/) .

You do not need:

  * [ A vehicle registration plate ](/en/travel-and-recreation/vehicle-standards/vehicle-registration-numbers/)
  * [ Motor tax ](/en/travel-and-recreation/motoring/motor-tax-and-insurance/motor-tax-rates/)
  * A [ driving licence ](/en/travel-and-recreation/motoring/driver-licensing/)
  * [ Compulsory insurance ](/en/travel-and-recreation/motoring/motor-tax-and-insurance/motor-insurance/)

##  Offences and penalties

If you break the rules of the road, you can be [ fined
](https://www.rsa.ie/road-safety/road-users/special-purpose-vehicles/powered-
personal-transportation#:~:text=No%20front%20lamp,warden%20stop%20sign.)
between €40 and €80.

You must not ride your e-bike under the influence of alcohol or drugs. Riding
under the influence can result in a court appearance and a fine of up to
€2,000.

##  Safety tips

It is important to look after your safety and the safety of others on the
road. Follow these safety tips when cycling your e-bike:

  * Take weather conditions into consideration. 
  * Be seen; wear reflective (hi-vis) clothing and personal protection gear. 
  * You should wear a helmet, although this is not legally required. 
  * Do not use headphones. 
  * Be mindful of others on the road. 

##  Buying an e-bike

Only buy an e-bike from a reputable retailer or distributor. You can use the [
Cycle to Work Scheme ](/en/travel-and-recreation/cycling/cycle-to-work-
scheme/) to help pay for a new e-bike.

Check that the e-bike is [ CE marked ](https://ec.europa.eu/growth/single-
market/ce-marking/) . It should have the manufacturer's details, manufacture
date and serial number on its CE plate.

The retailer should give you a declaration of conformity when you buy it.
