#  Disputes about equality and discrimination

  * Introduction 
  * Workplace mediation 
  * Adjudication 
  * How to make a complaint about employment rights 
  * More information about equality complaints 

##  Introduction

The [ Workplace Relations Commission (WRC) ](/en/employment/enforcement-and-
redress/workplace-relations-commission/) deals with all complaints of
discrimination in employment and access to goods and services.

If you complain to the WRC about an equality or discrimination dispute, your
complaint will either be handled using _mediation_ or _adjudication_ – see
more below.

These complaints come under the following equality legislation:

**The legislation** |  **What the legislation does**  
---|---  
The Employment Equality Acts 1998–2015  |  These Acts ban discrimination at work.  They cover discrimination about:  Recruitment and promotion  Equal pay  Working conditions  Training or experience  Dismissal  Harassment, including sexual harassment.  Read more about [ Equality in the workplace ](../equality_in_work/equality_in_the_workplace.en.html) .   
The Equal Status Acts 2000–2015  |  These Acts ban discrimination outside the workplace, in particular in:  The provision of goods and services  Selling, renting or leasing property (including the " [ housing assistance ground ](https://www.ihrec.ie/your-rights/advertising/housing-assistance-payment/) ")  Certain aspects of education.   
  
_Victimisation_ is also covered by equality legislation. Victimisation occurs
when a person is treated less favourably than another person because they
opposed discrimination, or were involved in a complaint of unlawful
discrimination. Read more about [ victimisation at work
](/en/employment/enforcement-and-redress/victimisation-at-work/) .

The Workplace Relations Commission also deals with complaints of
discrimination on the grounds of gender under the [ Pensions Acts 1990–2015
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1990/en/act/pub/0025/index.html) in relation
to occupational benefit or pensions schemes.

##  Workplace mediation

When you make a complaint under equality legislation, you may be offered [
workplace mediation ](/en/employment/enforcement-and-redress/workplace-
mediation/) . Mediation is a voluntary, private and confidential process,
unlike adjudication hearings which are usually held in public – see
‘Adjudication’ below.

Mediation can be carried out by phone, video, or face-to-face meetings.

During mediation, a mediator helps you and your employer come to an agreement.
At the end of mediation, both sides sign an agreement which is legally
binding. This means both sides must keep to the terms of the decision. The
agreement is not published.

If you do not reach an agreement through mediation, you can ask for your case
to be brought to adjudication - see 'Adjudication' below.

Read more about [ mediation on workplacerelations.ie
](https://www.workplacerelations.ie/en/Complaints_Disputes/Mediation/) .

##  Adjudication

If mediation is not used or is not successful, your complaint or dispute is
referred to an _adjudication officer_ within the Workplace Relations
Commission. The adjudication officer will carry out an inquiry, including a
hearing, and make a legally binding decision. This hearing is usually held in
public, except in exceptional circumstances.

The adjudicator’s decisions will include one or more of the following:

  * Compensation 
  * An order for equal pay or equal treatment 
  * An order that somebody takes a specified action. 

Read more about [ the adjudication process ](/en/employment/enforcement-and-
redress/adjudication-employment-rights-disputes-and-complaints/) , including
the importance of gathering evidence and what to expect from the hearing.

You can also get advice from a trade union, support group, a [ Citizens
Information Centre ](http://centres.citizensinformation.ie/) or the [ Irish
Human Rights and Equality Commission ](/en/justice/law-and-rights/irish-human-
rights-and-equality-commission/) .

##  How to make a complaint about employment rights

Depending on the law you are making your complaint under, you must follow
certain timeframes.

####  Complaints under the Employment Equality Acts 1998–2015 and complaints
about discrimination in pensions

In general, complaints must be brought **within 6 months** . The time limit
can be extended by a further 6 months, but only if there is reasonable cause
for the delay. You should make your complaint using the WRC's [ online
complaint form.
](https://www.workplacerelations.ie/en/complaints_disputes/refer_a_dispute_make_a_complaint/)

####  Complaint under the Equal Status Acts 2000–2015

You must first tell the person or organisation you are making the complaint
against **within 2 months** of the last act of discrimination.

To do this, you complete [ ES.1 form (pdf)
](https://www.workplacerelations.ie/en/Publications_Forms/Form-ES-1-Equal-
Status-Complaint-Notification1.pdf) and send it to the person or organisation
you are making the complaint against. The time limit for notification can be
extended to 4 months by the Director General of the Workplace Relations
Commission.

If you are not happy with the person's or organisation’s response, or if they
have not responded within 1 month from the date you notified them, you can
take your complaint to the WRC using [ the online complaint form
](https://www.workplacerelations.ie/en/complaints_disputes/refer_a_dispute_make_a_complaint/)
. Read about [ how to make a complaint ](/en/employment/enforcement-and-
redress/adjudication-employment-rights-disputes-and-complaints/) , including
details of the adjudication process.

###  Appeals

Decisions made by an adjudication officer can be appealed, to the [ Labour
Court ](/en/employment/enforcement-and-redress/employment-appeals/) for
employment and pensions cases, and to the [ Circuit Court
](/en/justice/courts-system/circuit-court/) for equal status cases. **Appeals
must be made within 42 days of when the decision was issued** .
