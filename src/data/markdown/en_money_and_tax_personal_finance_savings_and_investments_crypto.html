##  What is crypto?

The term crypto is most often used to refer to cryptocurrencies.

Standard currencies are types of money, for example, the euro, that you can
spend using physical notes and coins.

Cryptocurrency exists digitally or virtually and is transferred digitally.
Transactions are recorded and verified using a technology called blockchain.
This is known as _distributed ledger technology_ which means that it is a
record that is widely shared and is not controlled by any single person or
organisation.

Examples of cryptocurrencies include Bitcoin and Ethereum but there are many
others.

**Comparison of standard currencies and cryptocurrencies** **Standard currencies** |  **Cryptocurrencies**  
---|---  
Most currencies are legal tender, which means that they are official and must be accepted as payment.  |  Don’t have legal tender status. This means there is no legal requirement to accept payment in crypto. Acceptance is limited.   
Guaranteed by a central bank.  |  Not guaranteed by a central bank.   
Controlled by a central bank.  |  Not controlled by a central bank.   
Regulated, including with consumer protections such as the [ deposit guarantee scheme ](https://www.depositguarantee.ie/) .  |  The majority are unregulated in Ireland or the EU, without consumer protection or compensation.   
Can be in digital or physical form.  |  Exists in digital form only.   
  
##  Is crypto legal in Ireland?

Crypto is not banned in Ireland so it is legal. There are not very many laws
about crypto, so it is said to be largely unregulated.

Some  new laws are being introduced by the European Union  . These will
require the providers of crypto services to be authorised to operate in the
EU.

##  Risks of crypto

The [ Central Bank of Ireland describes crypto
](https://www.centralbank.ie/consumer-hub/crypto-consumer-information) as
being more like a very high-risk speculative asset than a currency. This is
because crypto has had very big increases and decreases in value that happen
very quickly and it can be used to make purchases only in limited
circumstances.

For this reason, it recommends that you do not spend money on crypto if you
cannot afford to lose it.

There are no protections such as the [ deposit guarantee scheme.
](https://www.depositguarantee.ie/) This means you have no comeback if you
lose some or all of your money on crypto.

Crypto can be very complex, making it difficult to understand what you are
buying.

[ The Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC) has advice on
common crypto scams ](https://www.ccpc.ie/consumers/money/digital-crypto-
currencies/) .

##  European Union law on crypto

The European Union (EU) is introducing a new law called the [ Markets in
Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCAR) ](https://eur-
lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2023/1114/oj) .

It will regulate service providers for crypto. For example, providers of
services to store, trade or advise on crypto.

The creation of crypto-assets is controlled by the _issuers_ of crypto. MiCAR
will introduce rules that apply to the issuers of specific types of crypto
that are linked to official currencies or other assets. These are known as
stablecoins.

Other cryptocurrencies continue to be unregulated in how they are issued, for
example, the way they are ‘mined’ (created).

The [ Central Bank of Ireland ](https://www.centralbank.ie/) is responsible
for implementing the regulations in Ireland.

###  Authorisation of crypto service providers

Under MiCAR, Crypto-Asset Service Providers in the EU will have to be
authorised by a central bank. The law comes into effect on 30 December 2024
but there will be a transitional (lead-in) period of 12 months before it
applies to existing providers in Ireland.

###  Market abuse

MiCAR includes rules to ban market abuse of crypto transactions or services.
This includes:

  * Illegal disclosure of inside information 
  * Insider trading 
  * Actions likely to disrupt or manipulate the market 

###  Issuers of stablecoins

Stablecoins are a type of crypto with a value that is linked to a more stable
asset such as gold or a standard currency like the euro.

MiCAR introduces new rules for the issuers of 2 types of stablecoin:

  * E-Money Tokens (EMTs), which are linked to a single official currency 
  * Asset-Referenced Tokens (ARTs), which are linked to several currencies, commodities or other types of crypto 

The rules set out new requirements for information, marketing and funding.
They apply to new issuers from 30 June 2024 and will apply to existing issuers
when they are authorised.

##  Taxation of crypto

There are no specific tax rules for crypto.

If you earn crypto, you have to pay income tax on it in the same way as other
income. If your only other income is PAYE income, read about [ tax on income
that is not from your employer ](/en/money-and-tax/tax/income-tax/tax-return-
non-paye-income/) .

If you make a profit from selling a crypto-asset, you have to pay [ Capital
Gains Tax ](/en/money-and-tax/tax/capital-taxes/capital-gains-tax/) in the
same way as for gains from any other asset such as property.

If you get a gift or inheritance of crypto, you have to pay [ Capital
Acquisitions Tax ](/en/money-and-tax/tax/capital-taxes/capital-acquisitions-
tax/) in the same way as for other gifts or inheritances.

[ Revenue has a guide to taxation of cryptocurrencies and crypto-assets
](https://www.revenue.ie/en/companies-and-charities/financial-
services/cryptocurrencies/index.aspx) .
