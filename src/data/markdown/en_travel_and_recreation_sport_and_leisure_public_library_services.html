##  Introduction

Local authorities run a network of public libraries in Ireland. Public
libraries are open to everyone and most of their services are free.

You can use some library services without becoming a member.

You need to join the library if you want to:

  * Borrow books or other items 
  * Access online magazine and newspaper subscriptions, or 
  * Take online courses 

You no longer have to pay fines for late returns. All previous unpaid fines
have been cancelled.

This page tells you about the services available at a library and how you can
become a member.

##  Becoming a member

To become a library member you need to:

  * Fill out the [ application form online ](https://librariesireland.spydus.ie/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/MSGTRN/WPAC/JOIN) or at any branch. 
  * Provide proof of your identity and of your address. 
  * Get your parent or guardian’s permission to join the library if you are under 18. 

You can read about the [ terms and conditions
](https://www.librariesireland.ie/join-your-library) of library membership.

Each library service issues its own library card. You can use any valid public
library card to reserve and borrow items from a public library.

You get a pin with your membership card when you join the library. You need
this number to use the computers and online services.

##  Library services

members. You can access courses through the [ Universal Class online system
](https://lgma.universalclass.com/barcode-login.htm?enter+code&loginspecial=)
.

A collection of teaching and learning resources for primary and secondary
schools are also available in the [ Learning Zone on askaboutIreland.ie
](http://www.askaboutireland.ie/learning-zone/) .

###  Information services

example, you get information about social welfare.

You can access the national environmental information service (ENFO). You can
use this service to find information on the main environmental topics in
Ireland.

You can get information about the history of your county or locality. For

###  Literacy support

The [ Right to Read programme
](https://www.librariesireland.ie/services/right-to-read) encourages children
to read. See how to encourage children to read. Some libraries also offer
support to adults who want to improve their literacy.

The [ Adult Literacy for Life (ALL) programme
](https://www.adultliteracyforlife.ie/) helps people develop their literacy,
numeracy and digital skills. There are free and local courses available.

###  Community groups

Public libraries often provide a space and support for groups. For example,
book clubs, movie clubs and mother and toddler groups. Most libraries know
about clubs and societies and events in their locality.

###  Photocopying and printing

Your local public library may provide photocopying and printing services.

[ Contact your local library ](http://www.askaboutireland.ie/libraries/public-
libraries/your-library-service/) to see what services are available there.

###  Reserves, requests, and renewals

If the book you want is already out on loan, you can reserve it in your local
library. The library will notify you when the book is available. You can also
reserve books online using the [ national library catalogue
](https://catalogue.nli.ie/) . You need your library card number and Personal
Identification Number (PIN) to do this. If you don't know your PIN, contact
your [ local library ](http://www.askaboutireland.ie/libraries/public-
libraries/your-library-service/) .

If the library does not have the book you want, you can request it online or
at your local library. The library may buy the book or look for a copy through
the inter-library loan system. This system lets libraries in Ireland, the UK,
and around the world, loan items to each other for their members.

Most libraries have a mobile app. You can use this to borrow e-books, access
the library catalogue, reserve, and renew books and manage your library
account. You can check with your local library if this service is available in
your area.

You will receive a reminder 3 days before your item is due back at the
library. If you would like to keep the item for longer than the length of your
loan, you can renew it online, by telephone or in person at the library.

##  Accessing library services

##  My Open Libraries

Some libraries have extended their opening hours through the [ My Open
Libraries programme
](https://www.gov.ie/pdf/?file=https://assets.gov.ie/45623/54bbbcc395e940f988f4b0df7c0897a8.pdf#page=1)

extended service is only available to members, and children (under 16) must be
accompanied by an adult.

During unstaffed hours, an automated service is available, which can be
accessed by using your library card and pin.

##  National Library Strategy

There is a library strategy, [ The library is the place 2023 - 2027
](https://www.gov.ie/en/news/e6d8e-the-library-is-the-place-new-five-year-
strategy-for-public-libraries-unveiled/) . It aims to improve and develop
national library services. The strategy will develop library infrastructure,
technology, programmes, and services. It aims to:

  * Make sure that everyone who uses the library can join a book club. 
  * Get more people to visit the library and libraries to spend more on books every year. 
  * Provide outreach library services and mobile libraries, especially in rural areas. 
  * Increase the number of My Open Library facilities. 
  * Rollout the national Skills for Life programme. It focuses on digital skills, financial literacy, sustainable lifestyles, and environmental awareness. 
  * Increase the amount of Irish language materials and services available.
