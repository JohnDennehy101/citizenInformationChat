##  Introduction

Local authorities run a network of public libraries in Ireland. Public
libraries are open to everyone and most of their services are free.

You can use some library services without becoming a member.

You need to join the library if you want to:

  * Borrow books or other items 
  * Access online magazine and newspaper subscriptions, or 
  * Take online courses 

You no longer have to pay fines for late returns. All previous unpaid fines
have been cancelled.

This page tells you about the services available at a library and how you can
become a member.

##  Becoming a member

To become a library member you need to:

  * Fill out the [ application form online ](https://librariesireland.spydus.ie/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/MSGTRN/WPAC/JOIN) or at any branch. 
  * Provide proof of your identity and of your address. 
  * Get your parent or guardian’s permission to join the library if you are under 18. 

You can read about the [ terms and conditions
](https://www.librariesireland.ie/join-your-library) of library membership.

Each library service issues its own library card. You can use any valid public
library card to reserve and borrow items from a public library.

You get a pin with your membership card when you join the library. You need
this number to use the computers and online services.

##  Library services

The services libraries provide differ depending on their size, location and
policies. Some of the services available include:

###  Lending services

Members can borrow books, CDs, DVDs, audiobooks, e-books, and other materials.
Libraries also have many books available in large-print format.

Most libraries have a junior section from babies to teenagers.

###  Internet services

You can use their computers to access the internet. In some cases, you may
need to be a member of your library to use the internet and you may have to
book a session in advance. Libraries may offer introductory sessions for new
users.

###  Publications

You can look up reference books and other materials. Such as dictionaries,
directories, encyclopedias, government publications, business information,
yearbooks, and atlases.

There are many journals and periodicals. These include national and local
newspapers and magazines on a variety of topics. You can also access [ digital
magazines ](https://www.librariesireland.ie/elibrary/emagazines) and [
newspapers ](https://www.librariesireland.ie/elibrary/online-newspapers)
online using your library bar code.

###  Online learning

There are hundreds of online courses in a variety of subjects for their
members. You can access courses through the [ Universal Class online system
](https://lgma.universalclass.com/barcode-login.htm?enter+code&loginspecial=)
.

You can access over 60 online language courses. Use the [ Mango Languages
software, which is available on your library's website
](https://www.librariesireland.ie/elibrary/online-languages) .

###  Educational support for schools and students

Services on offer for [ primary
](https://www.librariesireland.ie/services/services-to-schools/library-
services-to-primary-schools) and [ post-primary schools
](https://www.librariesireland.ie/services/services-to-schools/library-
services-to-post-primary-schools) , for example, class visits to the library.
A collection of teaching and learning resources for primary and secondary
schools are also available in the [ Learning Zone on askaboutIreland.ie
](http://www.askaboutireland.ie/learning-zone/) .

###  Information services

You can get information about services provided by government departments. For
example, you get information about social welfare.

You can access the national environmental information service (ENFO). You can
use this service to find information on the main environmental topics in
Ireland.

You can get information about the history of your county or locality. For
example, county and parish histories, maps, photographs, drawings, old
records, and newspapers.

You can get information about healthy and attend talks and presentations. This
is part of the [ Healthy Ireland initiative
](https://www.librariesireland.ie/services/healthy-ireland-at-your-library) .

###  Business and employment supports

The [ Work Matters ](http://www.librariesireland.ie/work-matters/) service at
the library can help you look for a job. It can also help you if you are
thinking of starting your own business. You can access business publications
and work-related e-learning courses. You have access to space for meetings,
study, and research.

###  Literacy support

The [ Right to Read programme
](https://www.librariesireland.ie/services/right-to-read) encourages children
to read. See how to encourage children to read. Some libraries also offer
support to adults who want to improve their literacy.

The [ Adult Literacy for Life (ALL) programme
](https://www.adultliteracyforlife.ie/) helps people develop their literacy,
numeracy and digital skills. There are free and local courses available.

###  Community groups

Public libraries often provide a space and support for groups. For example,
book clubs, movie clubs and mother and toddler groups. Most libraries know
about clubs and societies and events in their locality.

###  Photocopying and printing

Your local public library may provide photocopying and printing services.

[ Contact your local library ](http://www.askaboutireland.ie/libraries/public-
libraries/your-library-service/) to see what services are available there.

###  Reserves, requests, and renewals

If the book you want is already out on loan, you can reserve it in your local
library. The library will notify you when the book is available. You can also
reserve books online using the [ national library catalogue
](https://catalogue.nli.ie/) . You need your library card number and Personal
Identification Number (PIN) to do this. If you don't know your PIN, contact
your [ local library ](http://www.askaboutireland.ie/libraries/public-
libraries/your-library-service/) .

If the library does not have the book you want, you can request it online or
at your local library. The library may buy the book or look for a copy through
the inter-library loan system. This system lets libraries in Ireland, the UK,
and around the world, loan items to each other for their members.

Most libraries have a mobile app. You can use this to borrow e-books, access
the library catalogue, reserve, and renew books and manage your library
account. You can check with your local library if this service is available in
your area.

You will receive a reminder 3 days before your item is due back at the
library. If you would like to keep the item for longer than the length of your
loan, you can renew it online, by telephone or in person at the library.

##  Accessing library services

Depending on your age, you can access different collections and services. See
the [ terms and conditions ](https://www.librariesireland.ie/join-your-
library) :

  * **Adults** \- Access to all library collections, services and the internet. 
  * **Child under 12** \- Access to the children’s library, to DVDs up to a PG rating, and children’s internet services.

  * **Young adults 15-17 -** Access to the adult library, to DVDs up to 15 rating, and internet services. 

**Note** : Internet services for children vary between libraries. Parents are
responsible for their child in the library. This includes your child’s
selection and use of library materials and services, including any access to
the internet.

The number of items you can borrow at any one time and the length of time you
can keep them varies. You should ask for details at your local library.

You are expected to be quiet in the library as other people may be using the
library to study, work or read in peace.

Generally, you are not allowed to eat or drink in libraries.

##  My Open Libraries

Some libraries have extended their opening hours through the [ My Open
Libraries programme
](https://www.gov.ie/pdf/?file=https://assets.gov.ie/45623/54bbbcc395e940f988f4b0df7c0897a8.pdf#page=1)
. These libraries are open from 8am to 10pm every day of the year. This
extended service is only available to members, and children (under 16) must be
accompanied by an adult.

During unstaffed hours, an automated service is available, which can be
accessed by using your library card and pin.

##  National Library Strategy

There is a library strategy, [ The library is the place 2023 - 2027
](https://www.gov.ie/en/news/e6d8e-the-library-is-the-place-new-five-year-
strategy-for-public-libraries-unveiled/) . It aims to improve and develop
national library services. The strategy will develop library infrastructure,
technology, programmes, and services. It aims to:

  * Make sure that everyone who uses the library can join a book club. 
  * Get more people to visit the library and libraries to spend more on books every year. 
  * Provide outreach library services and mobile libraries, especially in rural areas. 
  * Increase the number of My Open Library facilities. 
  * Rollout the national Skills for Life programme. It focuses on digital skills, financial literacy, sustainable lifestyles, and environmental awareness. 
  * Increase the amount of Irish language materials and services available.
