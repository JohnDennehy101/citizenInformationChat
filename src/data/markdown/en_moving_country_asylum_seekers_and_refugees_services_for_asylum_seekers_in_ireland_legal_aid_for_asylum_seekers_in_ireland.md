##  What legal services are available to asylum seekers?

[ The Legal Aid Board ](http://www.legalaidboard.ie/) provides confidential
and independent [ legal services to people applying for asylum in Ireland
](http://www.legalaidboard.ie/en/Our-Services/Legal-Aid-Services/Services-for-
international-protection-applicants/Services/General-Information/Legal-
Services.html) . It can help you with your application for international
protection (covering both refugee status and subsidiary protection) to the
International Protection Office and appeals to the International Protection
Appeals Tribunal.

It can **not** assist you with a judicial review of how the decision on your
application was made, but you might be able to get [ civil legal aid
](/en/justice/legal-aid-and-advice/civil-legal-advice-and-legal-aid/) for that
separately.

The [ Irish Refugee Council Independent Law Centre
](https://www.irishrefugeecouncil.ie/Listing/Category/law-centre) also
provides early legal advice and representation to people in the early stages
of the asylum process.

###  Services provided

The Legal Aid Board can help you in the following ways:

  * It can give you advice before you submit your questionnaire to the [ International Protection Office ](http://www.ipo.gov.ie/) or before you attend your interview in the International Protection Office 
  * It can represent you before the International Protection Appeals Tribunal 
  * It can also help if the International Protection Office decides to remove you from Ireland and send you to another EEA country under the [ Dublin III Regulation ](/en/moving-country/asylum-seekers-and-refugees/the-asylum-process-in-ireland/dublin-convention/)

###  Your obligations as a client

If you become a client of the Legal Aid Board you must:

  * Tell the Legal Aid Board your current address. 
  * Attend all appointments made for you with your caseworker or solicitor in the Legal Aid Board. Strict limits apply at all stages of the asylum process and you could lost your legal aid services if you fail to attend appointments. 

##  How much do I pay towards my legal costs?

To qualify for legal services, your income (less certain allowances) must be
below a set amount. You can read more about the general means assessment for [
civil legal aid and advice
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/justice/legal-aid-and-advice/civil-
legal-advice-and-legal-aid/) .

If your only income is the [ Daily Expenses Allowance ](/en/moving-
country/asylum-seekers-and-refugees/services-for-asylum-seekers-in-
ireland/direct-provision/) and you have less than €4000 in savings and assets,
you will be asked to pay a contribution of €10 for legal aid to help with your
claim for asylum or subsidiary protection. If you can’t pay this, you can
request that the fee is waived on hardship grounds.
