##  What is Jobseeker's Benefit?

Jobseeker's Benefit is a weekly payment from the Department of Social
Protection (DSP) to people who are out of work and are covered by [ social
insurance (PRSI) ](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/social-
insurance-prsi/social-insurance/) . If you don't qualify for Jobseeker's
Benefit you may qualify for [ Jobseeker's Allowance ](/en/social-
welfare/unemployed-people/jobseekers-allowance/) .

[ Jobseeker’s Benefit (Self-Employed) ](/en/social-welfare/unemployed-
people/jobseekers-benefit-self-employed/) gives income support to self-
employed people who are no longer engaged in self-employment.

####  **Benefit payment for 65 year olds**

If you are 65 and have left employment or self-employment, you may qualify for
the [ Benefit Payment for 65 Year Olds
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/social-welfare-
payments/older-and-retired-people/payment-for-people-retired-at-65/) until you
turn 66.

####

##  How to qualify for Jobseeker's Benefit

To qualify for Jobseeker's Benefit (JB) you must:

  * Be under pension age 
  * Be unemployed (you must be fully unemployed or unemployed for at least 4 days out of 7) 
  * Have had a substantial loss of employment and as a result be unemployed for at least 4 days out of 7 
  * Be capable of work 
  * Be available for and genuinely seeking work 
  * Have enough social insurance (PRSI) contributions 

###  **Pension age**

Pension age is 66, but if you [ defer getting your State Pension
(Contributory) ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/social-
welfare-payments/older-and-retired-people/deferring-your-state-pension-
contributory/) to after age 66, you may qualify for Jobseeker's Benefit during
this period. If you're 66 or over, apply for Jobseeker's Benefit using a paper
form from your local Intreo Cent or Social Welfare Branch Office. You will not
get credited PRSI contributions while getting Jobseeker’s Benefit at age 66 or
over.

You can read more about [ the conditions for getting a jobseeker's payment
](/en/social-welfare/unemployed-people/rules-for-getting-a-jobseekers-
payment/) and about the [ employment services the Department of Social
Protection offers to jobseekers ](/en/social-welfare/unemployed-
people/employment-supports/) .

####

###  Jobseeker's Benefit and work

To get Jobseeker's Benefit, you must be unemployed, or have lost at least one
day's employment and as a result be unemployed for at least 4 days out of 7
days. You may continue to get Jobseeker's Benefit if you can only find part-
time or casual work.

If you’re getting Jobseeker's Benefit and you work part-time during the week,
your payment is based on a 5-day payment week. This means that for each day
you work, 1/5th of the normal rate of Jobseeker's Benefit is deducted. If you
work part-time for 2 days, you will get 3/5ths of the normal Jobseeker's
Benefit for that week, and if you work part-time for 3 days, you will get
2/5ths of the normal rate of Jobseeker’s Benefit for the week. You must still
be unemployed for at least 4 days out of 7 to claim Jobseeker's Benefit.

There is an exemption from some of the [ rules for retained firefighters
](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/e95f88-operational-guidelines-jobseekers-
benefit/#available-for-full-time-
work:~:text=should%20be%20investigated.-,Part%2Dtime%20fire%20fighters,-Retained%20fire%20fighters)
.

See more information about [ work and Jobseeker’s Benefit ](/en/social-
welfare/social-welfare-payments-and-work/jobseekers-benefit-and-work/) .

If you are getting JB, you can use the online [ Benefit of Work Ready Reckoner
](https://www.mywelfare.ie/benefitofworkjsestimator) from the DSP. It helps
you figure out how much money you would get if you took up full-time work,
including any Working Family Payment, and compares it to what you currently
get from Jobseeker's Benefit, including Rent Supplement.

###  Loss of employment

You must have suffered a substantial loss of employment in any period of 7
consecutive days to qualify for Jobseeker's Benefit. This means that you must
have lost at least one day's employment and, as a result of this loss, be
unemployed for at least 4 days out of 7. Your earnings must also have been
reduced because of the loss of employment.

Casual workers and retained firefighters with no other employment are exempt
from this rule.

###  Pregnancy and Jobseeker's Benefit

There are some exceptions to the rules for pregnant women around the time of
birth. You can read more in our page about [ pregnancy and social welfare
payments ](/en/social-welfare/families-and-children/pregnancy-and-social-
welfare-payments/) .

##  Social insurance (PRSI) contributions

To qualify for Jobseeker's Benefit, you must pay Class A, H or P PRSI
contributions. Class A is the one paid by most private sector employees. Class
H is paid by soldiers, reservists and temporary army nurses, who do not
qualify for Jobseeker's Benefit until they have left the army. To qualify you
need:

  * At least 104 weeks of Class A, H or P PRSI paid contributions or at least 156 Class S PRSI contributions since you first started work 

**And**

  * 39 weeks of A, H or P PRSI paid or credited in the relevant tax year (a minimum of 13 weeks must be paid contributions ***** ) 

**Or**

  * 26 weeks of A, H or P PRSI paid in the relevant tax year and 26 weeks of PRSI paid in the tax year immediately before the relevant tax year. 

***** If you do not have 13 paid contributions in the relevant tax year, you
must have paid 13 contributions in any of the following years:

  * The 2 tax years before the relevant tax year 
  * The last complete tax year 
  * The current tax year. 

The relevant tax year is the second-last complete tax year before the year in
which your claim is made. So, for claims made in 2024, the relevant tax year
is 2022.

####  **PRSI contributions**

There are a number of circumstances in which you can be awarded [ credited
contributions ](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/social-
insurance-prsi/credited-social-insurance-contributions/) . For example, pre-
entry credits are given when you start employment for the first time in your
working life. However, you can only qualify for Jobseeker's Benefit when you
have actually paid 104 Class A, H or P contributions or at least 156 Class S
contributions. Credits are also awarded while you are getting certain social
welfare payments, including Jobseeker's Benefit (provided it is for 6 days), [
Illness Benefit ](/en/social-welfare/disability-and-illness/illness-benefit/)
and, in some cases, Jobseeker's Allowance.

Contributions you have paid in other member states of the EU or EEA will be
added to your Irish contributions. If you are applying for Jobseeker's Benefit
and need the contributions paid in another EU or EEA member state to help you
qualify, then your last contribution must have been in Ireland. Read more
about [ combining social insurance contributions from abroad ](/en/social-
welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/claiming-a-social-welfare-payment/social-
insurance-contributions-from-abroad/) .

Under the [ Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act 2005
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2005/act/26/enacted/en/html) , employers
must register all employees for PRSI. Read more in our page on your [
Employer's duty to pay social insurance
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-
system/social-insurance-prsi/paying-social-insurance/) .

##  Disqualification

You may be disqualified from getting Jobseeker's Benefit for 9 weeks if you:

  * Left work voluntarily and without a reasonable cause 
  * Lost your job through misconduct 
  * Refused an offer of suitable alternative employment or suitable training - if you have been on a penalty rate of JB for at least 21 days 
  * Are aged under 55 and get a redundancy payment of more than €50,000. The exact length of your disqualification (up to 9 weeks) will depend on the amount of redundancy payment you received. 

###  Redundancy

If you are under 55 and get a redundancy payment of more than €50,000, you are
disqualified from claiming Jobseeker's Benefit for a certain period of time.
The table below shows how long you may be disqualified for. Any period of
disqualification is subtracted from your total Jobseeker's Benefit
entitlement. So, if you are disqualified for 3 weeks (which is 18 days'
payment) your JB claim starts on day 19.

**Amount of redundancy payment** |  **Period of disqualification**  
---|---  
€50,000.01 - €55,000  |  1 week   
€55,000.01 - €60,000  |  2 weeks   
€60,000.01 - €65,000  |  3 weeks   
€65,000.01 - €70,000  |  4 weeks   
€70,000.01 - €75,000  |  5 weeks   
€75,000.01 - €80,000  |  6 weeks   
€80,000.01 - €85,000  |  7 weeks   
€85,000.01 - €90,000  |  8 weeks   
€90,000.01 and over  |  9 weeks   
  
##  How long is Jobseeker's Benefit paid?

Jobseeker's Benefit is paid for 9 months (234 days) for people with 260 or
more Class A, H or P PRSI paid contributions. It is paid for 6 months (156
days) for people with fewer than 260 Class A, H or P PRSI paid contributions.

[ There are some different rules for older jobseekers. ](/en/social-
welfare/unemployed-people/older-jobseekers/)

**For new JB claimants since 4 April 2013** **Number of contributions** |  **Duration of JB claim**  
---|---  
260 or more  |  234 days (9 months)   
Less than 260  |  156 days (6 months)   
  
###  Re-qualifying for Jobseeker's Benefit

You can re-qualify for JB if:

  * You have used up your full JB entitlement (either 9 or 6 months) 

and

  * You have paid 13 PRSI contributions for at least 13 weeks (these contributions can be counted only after you have claimed at least 156 days (6 months) of JB) 

However, if you are working and claiming JB (systematic short-time workers and
part-time workers) you can't continue your JB claim when it is used up since
you must have suffered a substantial loss of employment to re-qualify for JB,
(unless you are a casual worker).

If you have lost your job you will have suffered a substantial loss of
employment. If you are a part-time or systematic short-time worker, DSP will
look at your pattern of employment over the last 13 weeks or another
representative period to find out whether you have suffered a substantial loss
of employment.

For example, if you are getting JB and working 3 days a week as a systematic
short-time worker or a part-time worker, and your employment pattern has not
changed during your JB claim, you will not have suffered a substantial loss of
employment and will not re-qualify for Jobseeker’s Benefit when you exhaust
your claim. However, if your JB claim ends and your 3-day working week is then
reduced to a 2-day week, you will have suffered a substantial loss of
employment and may re-qualify for Jobseeker’s Benefit.

###  Linking claims

If you claim Jobseeker's Benefit (JB) for a period, sign off and then claim JB
again within 26 weeks, your claim may be linked to the earlier claim. This
means that your claim is not treated as a new claim and:

  * You do not have to wait for 3 days before getting your payment 
  * The cumulative total of days from the previous claim is continued (so, for example, if you have used up 100 days of your total JB entitlement of 234 days you have 134 days remaining on your claim) 
  * The rate of JB is the same rate payable as on the previous claim, unless there has been a budget increase or change in family circumstances (such as a new child dependant). 

If your JB claim does not link to a previous claim, it is treated as a new
claim. You must wait for 3 days before getting a payment and your cumulative
total of days starts from the first day of payment.

You can read more about [ linking claims
](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/e95f88-operational-guidelines-jobseekers-
benefit/#waiting-days-and-claim-linking) including information on linking to a
different scheme (such as Illness Benefit) and linking to an earlier JB claim
through a different scheme or period spent in training or on an employment
scheme.

###  Short-term employment or training

The Department of Social Protection operates a fast-tracking system for people
who sign off to take up work for a short period (up to 12 weeks) or to go on a
short training course (up to 12 weeks). This ensures that your payment is re-
instated without delay. It is important that you inform your Intreo Centre or
local Social Welfare Branch Office before you start work or training. Your [
Rent Supplement ](/en/social-welfare/supplementary-welfare-schemes/rent-
supplement/) claim can also be suspended for up to 12 weeks.

##  Rate of Jobseeker's Benefit

You should apply for Jobseeker's Benefit the first day you become unemployed.
It is important to apply on the first day you become unemployed because you
will not get paid for the first 3 days of your claim.

**Weekly** **Jobseeker’s Benefit rate 2024**

**Average weekly earnings** |  **Maximum personal rate** |  **Increase for an adult dependant** |  **Increase for a child dependant**  
---|---|---|---  
€300 or more  |  €232  |  €154  |  Child aged under 12  €46 (full rate), €23 (half rate)  Child aged 12 and over  €54 (full rate), €27 (half rate)   
€220-299.99  |  €181.70  |  €99.70   
€150-€219.99  |  €149.60   
Less than €150  |  €104.10   
  
You get a personal rate and may get an increase for an [ adult dependant
](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/claiming-a-social-welfare-
payment/claiming-an-increase-in-your-social-welfare-payment-for-an-adult-
dependant/) and [ child dependant ](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-
system/claiming-a-social-welfare-payment/claiming-and-increase-in-your-
payment-for-a-child-dependant/) (see below). Your average weekly earnings do
not affect the amount you get for a child dependant.

**Average weekly earnings**

Jobseeker's Benefit rates are based on your earnings in the relevant tax year.
Your average weekly earnings are your gross yearly earnings from employment
divided by the number of Class A, H or P paid contributions in the _relevant
tax year_ .

The relevant tax year is 2 years before the year of your claim. For example,
if you claim Jobseeker's Benefit in 2024 the relevant tax year is 2022. If you
qualify for a reduced JB payment, it may be of greater benefit for you to
claim [ Jobseeker's Allowance ](/en/social-welfare/unemployed-
people/jobseekers-allowance/) instead of Jobseeker's Benefit.

If you had no earnings from work but got the Pandemic Unemployment Payment in
2021, you will meet the average weekly earnings requirement for a claim where
2021 is your relevant tax year, and get the maximum rate of Jobseeker’s
Benefit. However, if you had earnings from work in 2021, your average weekly
earnings will be calculated by dividing your gross yearly earnings by the
number of paid contributions.

####  Penalty rates

Your payment can be reduced if you refuse or fail to attend meetings requested
by the Department or if you refuse or fail to participate in an appropriate
employment support scheme, work experience or training. You can find out about
[ sanctions for not meeting the conditions of your jobseeker's payment.
](/en/social-welfare/unemployed-people/rules-for-getting-a-jobseekers-
payment/)

###  Claiming for dependants with Jobseeker's Benefit

If your spouse, civil partner or cohabitant is dependent on you or is on a low
income, you may be able to claim an [ Increase for a Qualified Adult (IQA)
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-
system/claiming-a-social-welfare-payment/claiming-an-increase-in-your-social-
welfare-payment-for-an-adult-dependant/) . The table below explains how much
you can get, depending on their income.

**Spouse, civil partner or cohabitant income** |  **Increase for a Qualified Adult (IQA)**  
---|---  
€0 to €100  |  Maximum IQA   
€100 to €310  |  Reduced rate of IQA   
Over €310  |  No increase in Jobseeker’s Benefit   
  
From June 2024, if you are getting an Increase for Qualified Adult, any child
maintenance they get is no longer included in the income test. However, if
they get maintenance that is not child maintenance, this will continue to be
included in their assessed income.

You can look at our pages on [ Claiming for an adult dependant ](/en/social-
welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/claiming-a-social-welfare-
payment/claiming-an-increase-in-your-social-welfare-payment-for-an-adult-
dependant/) and [ Jobseeker's Benefit and work ](/en/social-welfare/social-
welfare-payments-and-work/jobseekers-benefit-and-work/) to find out more. If
you have [ dependent children ](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-
system/claiming-a-social-welfare-payment/claiming-and-increase-in-your-
payment-for-a-child-dependant/) you may also be able to claim an increase in
your payment for them.

###  Getting paid

You can collect your Jobseeker's Benefit payment weekly from your nearest [
post office ](https://www.anpost.com/Store-Locator) .

You must bring valid photo ID with you to collect your payment. The following
is valid photo ID:

  * [ Public Services Card ](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/public-services-card/)
  * Driving licence 
  * Passport 
  * [ Irish Residence Permit (IRP) ](/en/moving-country/moving-to-ireland/rights-of-residence-in-ireland/registration-of-non-eea-nationals-in-ireland/) or GNIB card 

Staff working in the post office may ask to see your photo ID before giving
you your payment.

###  Taxation of Jobseeker's Benefit

[ Jobseeker's Benefit is taxable ](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-
system/claiming-a-social-welfare-payment/taxation-of-social-welfare-payments/)
. However, if you are getting Jobseeker's Benefit because your normal working
week has been reduced temporarily (Short-time Work Support), your Jobseeker's
Benefit is not taxed. If you are working part-time and getting Jobseeker’s
Benefit for the days you are not employed, your Jobseeker’s Benefit _is_
taxable. [ Find out more about the taxation of Jobseeker's Benefit and the
taxation of JB for systematic short-time workers.
](https://www.revenue.ie/en/jobs-and-pensions/periods-of-
unemployment/taxation-jobseekers-benefit-self-employed.aspx)

###  Extra benefits

If you are getting Jobseeker's Benefit, you may be entitled to:

  * [ Rent Supplement ](/en/social-welfare/supplementary-welfare-schemes/rent-supplement/) \- a payment under the Supplementary Welfare Allowance scheme. 
  * [ Back to School Clothing and Footwear Allowance ](/en/social-welfare/families-and-children/back-to-school-clothing-and-footwear-allowance/) \- an allowance to help with the cost of uniforms and footwear for children who are attending school. 
  * [ Medical card ](/en/health/medical-cards-and-gp-visit-cards/medical-card/) \- if your income is below a certain level, you may get a medical card. 

You do not qualify for the [ Household Benefits Package ](/en/social-
welfare/extra-social-welfare-benefits/household-benefits-package/) or [ Free
Travel ](/en/social-welfare/extra-social-welfare-benefits/free-travel/) with
Jobseeker’s Benefit.  

##  When to apply for Jobseeker's Benefit

You should apply for Jobseeker's Benefit the first day you become unemployed.
Jobseeker's Benefit is not paid for the first 3 days you are unemployed (the
first 3 days are any 3 days, not necessarily consecutive, in a period of 7
consecutive days).

If you are unemployed for a second time within 26 weeks of your last JB
payment, your application for Jobseeker's Benefit is not treated as a new
claim and you do not have another 3 days of non-payment. See 'Linking claims'
above.

More information is available in our page about [ signing on for the first
time. ](/en/social-welfare/unemployed-people/signing-on/)

If you think you have been wrongly refused Jobseeker's Benefit you can [
appeal the decision ](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/social-
welfare-appeals/) .
