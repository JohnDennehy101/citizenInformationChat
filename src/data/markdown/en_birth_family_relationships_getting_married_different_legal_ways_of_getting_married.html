##  Introduction

In Ireland, there are 3 different ways to legally marry. A marriage may be
celebrated in a civil ceremony, a religious ceremony or in a secular ceremony
and each is equally valid and binding under Irish law. For a marriage to be
legal, the ceremony must be performed by a registered solemniser (see
'Registered solemnisers' below).

To have a legally valid marriage in Ireland, both parties must:

  * Have the [ capacity to marry ](/en/birth-family-relationships/getting-married/legal-requirements-for-marriage/)
  * Freely consent to the marriage, and 
  * Meet the [ notification requirements for marriage ](/en/birth-family-relationships/getting-married/notification-requirements-for-marriage/) . 

Once you have fulfilled these conditions, you should consider how you wish to
marry.  

##  Types of wedding ceremony

###  Civil ceremony

Civil ceremonies are legally binding secular marriage ceremonies performed by
a registrar. The registrar works for the State.

Civil ceremonies can take place in a registry office, or registrars can travel
to perform civil ceremonies in an approved room or venue. In general,
registrars only perform ceremonies in the county in which they are based.

Civil ceremonies can only take place within the office working hours of the
registrar.

There can be no mention of anything religious or spiritual in your ceremony.
If you are planning to get married by civil ceremony, you should contact the [
civil registration service ](https://www2.hse.ie/services/births-deaths-and-
marriages/contact-a-civil-registration-service.html) in the district in which
you intend to marry for advice on how to proceed. There is no requirement to
live in the district where you want to get married.

Further information is also available in our page describing [ civil marriage
ceremonies ](/en/birth-family-relationships/getting-married/civil-marriage-
ceremony/) .

###  Religious ceremony

Religious ceremonies are performed by registered religious solemnisers of
established religions. They typically take place in their places of worship
and the ceremony is performed according to the beliefs and philosophies of the
particular body or church.

If you are getting married by [ religious ceremony ](/en/birth-family-
relationships/getting-married/religious-and-secular-marriage-ceremonies/) ,
you should contact the authorities of the religious body concerned for
guidance on how to proceed.

###  Secular ceremony

Secular ceremonies are legally recognised in Ireland if they are carried out
by a registered secular solemniser. Secular ceremonies are performed by bodies
that have a viewpoint that does not include anything religious or spiritual.
Humanist ceremonies are the most common type of secular ceremony in Ireland.

If you wish to get married by secular ceremony you should contact the
authorities of the secular body concerned for advice on how to proceed.

##  Renewing your wedding vows

In Ireland, someone who is already married cannot get married again (even if
it is to the same person). This means that you cannot renew your wedding vows
in a civil ceremony in Ireland.

However, there is a long tradition of "church blessings" in Ireland. This is
where Irish people who have married in civil ceremonies abroad, marry in a
religious ceremony the next time they are home. Sometimes, people living in
Ireland have their marriage blessed in a religious ceremony, to commemorate a
special anniversary or event. If you would like to have your marriage blessed,
you should get in touch with your local member of the clergy.

##  Rules

Whether you decide on a religious, secular or civil ceremony you will require
a Marriage Registration Form (MRF). You can get your MRF by giving [ 3 monthsâ€™
notice of intention to marry ](/en/birth-family-relationships/getting-
married/notification-requirements-for-marriage/) to the registrar at a [ Civil
Registration Service ](https://www2.hse.ie/services/births-deaths-and-
marriages/contact-a-civil-registration-service.html) . You should contact your
local civil registration service to make an appointment with the registrar.
You can also use the [ online booking system
](https://www2.hse.ie/services/births-deaths-and-marriages/getting-
married/book-appointment/) .

##  Registered solemnisers

A solemniser is the term given to a person licensed by the State to conduct
weddings. Only a registered solemniser can perform a legally binding wedding
ceremony. The [ General Register Office
](https://www.gov.ie/en/campaigns/af7893-general-register-office/) maintains a
[ Register of Solemnisers of Marriage (pdf)
](https://www.welfare.ie/en/downloads/RegisterOfSolemnisers.pdf) and anyone
solemnising a civil, secular or religious marriage must be on the Register.
These categories are clearly outlined in the Register of Solemnisers as
civil/religious/secular.

##  How to apply?

Check the [ Register of Solemnisers
](https://www.welfare.ie/en/downloads/RegisterOfSolemnisers.pdf) maintained by
the [ General Register Office
](https://www.gov.ie/en/campaigns/af7893-general-register-office/) to find a
registered solemniser who can perform a legally binding wedding ceremony.

If you are planning a [ civil ceremony ](/en/birth-family-
relationships/getting-married/civil-marriage-ceremony/) in a Registry Office
or other approved place, you should contact the [ Registrar of Civil Marriages
](http://www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/1/bdm/contactus/) for the district in
which you intend to marry for advice on how to proceed.

If you are planning to get married by religious or secular ceremony, you
should contact the religious or secular body concerned for guidance on how to
proceed.
