#  How do I add a category to my Irish driving licence?

  * Introduction 
  * Apply online 
  * Apply in person 
  * More information 

##  Introduction

You can add a [ category of a motor vehicle
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/travel-and-recreation/motoring/driver-
licensing/categories-of-motor-vehicles-and-minimum-age-of-drivers-in-ireland/)
to your driving licence either online or in person. Your current driving
licence must be in date.

You may need to complete a test for the new licence category you want to add,
such as a [ truck ](https://www.rsa.ie/services/learner-drivers/get-
qualified/cpc-driver---truck---c) or [ bus category
](https://www.rsa.ie/services/learner-drivers/get-qualified/bus---d) . Certain
categories may be added automatically to your licence without another test.
For example, you can automatically drive a tractor if you have a car licence.

The Road Safety Authority (RSA) has responsibility for driver licensing. The
National Driver Licence Service (NDLS) manages licence applications and
renewals.
