#  Age Card

  * How to apply for an Age Card 
  * Replacing a lost or missing Age Card 

##  Introduction

If you are aged 18 or over you can apply for an Age Card to prove that you
have reached the legal age when purchasing alcohol.

The Age Card includes the following information:

  * Your name 
  * Your date of birth 
  * A photograph of you 
  * Relevant security features (such as a metal hologram, embossed symbol or encoded magnetic stripe) 

The Age card is a proof of age card and is not an identity card. This card can
only be used to show you have reached the legal age for purchasing alcohol. It
should not be used for any other purpose.

##  Who can apply for a National Age Card?

You can apply for an Age Card if you are 18 or over and live in Ireland.

##  How much does the Age Card cost?

The Age Card costs €10. It also costs €10 to replace a lost or missing Age
Card.

You must pay online when you are applying for an Age Card. You can use a debit
or credit card, or an age card voucher which you can buy in any [ post office
](http://www.anpost.ie/AnPost/at+your+local+Post+Office.htm) .

##  How to apply for an Age Card

Apply and pay for your Age Card online at [ www.agecard.ie
](https://www.agecard.ie) . You will receive an application form by post
containing your details within 3 working days of applying.

You must bring the application form to your [ local Garda Station
](https://www.garda.ie/en/contact-us/station-directory/) for authentication
within 3 months.

You must also bring the following 3 items:

  * Your birth certificate, your passport or your [ Irish Residence Permit Card ](https://www.irishimmigration.ie/registering-your-immigration-permission/information-on-registering/irish-residence-permit/)
  * One other form of identification 
  * One recent passport-sized photograph 

The Garda Station will send your application form and photograph to the
printers and you will get your Age Card within 10 working days.

You can track your application online provided you know your application form
number.

##  Replacing a lost or missing Age Card

If you have lost your Age Card, the application process and cost to replace
your card is the same as applying for a new Age Card (see 'How to apply'
above). You must report the loss or theft of your original card when
presenting your application at your local Garda Station.
