##  Right to silence and right to be cautioned

###

You have the [ right to silence ](/en/justice/arrests/right-to-silence-in-
criminal-cases/) and the right not to incriminate yourself.

These rights protect you from being forced to make statements which result in
an admission of guilt. In Ireland, these rights are recognised under:

  * Article 38.1 of the [ Irish Constitution ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/government-in-ireland/irish-constitution-1/) (Bunreacht na hÉireann) 
  * Article 6 of the [ European Convention on Human Rights ](http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Treaties/Html/005.htm)

###  **Right to be cautioned**

A statement is anything a suspect says about a possible offence being
investigated. Often statements are written down and are then signed by a
suspect.

The following words must be spoken by the [ Gardaí (Irish police)
](/en/justice/law-enforcement/garda-siochana-national-police-force/) before
they can take a statement from a suspect:

“You are not obliged to say anything unless you wish to do so, but anything
you say will be taken down in writing and may be given in evidence.”

This is known as the _caution_ . It means that you are informed that there is
no legal obligation on you to say anything or to make a statement.

If you make a statement to the Gardaí and the Garda gave you a caution before
the statement was taken, then the contents of the statement can be used in a
court case or trial.

##  Giving statements and confessions

The rules covering the taking of statements from suspects are called the
_Judges’ Rules_ .

The 9 Judge’s Rules are a guide for the Gardaí when investigating a crime to
ensure that suspects are treated fairly. The rules seek to ensure that any
suspect making a statement to the Gardaí is informed of their right to silence
by way of the caution.

Any statement taken from a suspect, in a way which breaks these rules, is
likely not to be allowed as evidence by a judge conducting a criminal trial.

###  **Statement taken in breach of Judge’s Rules**

There is a difference between a statement you made involuntarily and a
statement taken in breach of the Judges’ Rules.

An involuntary statement must be excluded in a trial, but a statement taken in
breach of the Judges’ Rules _can_ be allowed by the judge (if the judge
decides). This is because the Judge’s Rules do not have the force of law. So,
the judge has discretion to include or exclude such statements.

###  **Confessions**

Often, a statement by a suspect includes a [ confession
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/justice/arrests/confessions/)
admitting their part in a crime. If you make a confession in a statement, then
the court will look very closely at the circumstances which surrounded the
making of the confession.

##  Free and voluntary statements and confessions

The most important aspect of a confession (or statement) is whether you
volunteered it.

If you make a confession (verbally or in writing), before a trial or court
case, it can only be used as proof against you if it was a free and voluntary
confession.

Your confession is free and voluntary, if you are not influenced by hope or
fear, from a threat, a promise or wrongful persuasion.

###  **How does the court know if a statement is involuntary?**

The courts typically consider:

  * Were the words used by the person in authority, objectively viewed, capable of being a threat or inducement? 
  * Did the accused understand them as a threat or inducement? 
  * Was the statement the result of a threat or inducement? 

All three questions must be answered yes for the statement of confession to be
considered involuntary.

###  **Can interviews be recorded in Garda stations?**

Certain interviews must be recorded electronically in Garda stations under the
provisions of:

  * Section 30 of the [ Offences Against the State Act 1939 ](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1939/en/act/pub/0013/index.html)
  * Section 4 of the [ Criminal Justice Act 1984 ](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1984/en/act/pub/0022/index.html)
  * Section 2 of the [ Criminal Justice (Drug Trafficking) Act 1996 ](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1996/en/act/pub/0029/index.html)
  * Section 42 of the [ Criminal Justice Act 1999 ](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1999/en/act/pub/0010/index.html)
  * Section 50 of the [ Criminal Justice Act 2007 ](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2007/en/act/pub/0029/index.html)
  * Section 16 or 17 of the [ Criminal Procedure Act 2010 ](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2010/en/act/pub/0027/index.html)

Your interview with the Gardaí must be electronically recorded if the
recording equipment is in the station. You can read more about [ detention
after arrest.
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/justice/arrests/detention-after-
arrest/)

For the courts and the suspect, the recorded interview may prove whether or
not the statements were made voluntarily.

Read more about [ your rights during a Garda interview
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/justice/arrests/garda-interviews/) .

##  Procedure for making statements or confessions

###  **You must be given a caution**

If you decide to make a statement as a suspect, the Gardaí must tell you of
your right to remain silent.

This caution must also be included in the top line of the written statement.

The Gardaí should not cross-examine you if you are making a statement.
However, Gardaí can ask you questions to clarify anything you say which is
unclear.

###  **Writing the statement**

The contents of the statement are then written down, either by you or by the
Gardaí. Normally this is done by the Gardaí, but you are allowed to write the
statement if you wish.

When you are finished making your written statement, the Gardaí either read
out the statement to you or invite you to read the statement yourself.

###  **Changing your statement**

When you have read the statement, the Gardaí then invite you to make any
changes or add to the statement if you want to. This is noted at the end of
the statement in the following way.

“This statement has been read over to (or by) me, and I have been invited to
make any corrections thought necessary in it. It is correct”.

###  **Signing your statement**

The Gardaí then ask you to sign the statement. The signature should be written
on the next available line and should be witnessed by those present. In the
case of a juvenile, the signature should also be witnessed by a parent, adult
relative or guardian.

If you refuse to sign the statement, the Gardaí insert the words “Declined to
sign” and they include your reasons for refusing. If you cannot read or write,
you are asked to make a mark in place of a signature.

##  Can a suspect get a copy of their statement from Gardaí?

###  **Getting a copy of my statement**

If you make a statement to the Gardaí, you are entitled to a copy of the
statement free of charge. If you engage a solicitor after making your
statement, then your solicitor is entitled to a copy of the statement free of
charge.

If another person has been charged with the same offence and their statement
was taken separately, the Gardaí should not read this statement to you. You
should, however, be given a copy of that statement and the Gardaí should say
nothing that would invite a reply.

###  **Copy of electronically recorded statement**

If you make a statement to the Gardaí and it is electronically recorded then
you or your solicitor is entitled to a copy of the electronic recording,
unless it would prejudice an ongoing investigation or endanger the safety,
security and wellbeing of another person. There is no fee for this recording.
