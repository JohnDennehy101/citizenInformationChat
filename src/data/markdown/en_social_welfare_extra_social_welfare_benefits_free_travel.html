  * How to use Free Travel 
  * Where can I use Free Travel? 
  * How to qualify for Free Travel 
  * How to apply for Free Travel 
  * Where to apply for Free Travel 
  * Senior SmartPass for travelling in Northern Ireland 

##  What is the Free Travel Scheme?

The [ Free Travel Scheme ](https://www.gov.ie/en/service/9bba61-free-travel-
scheme/) allows you to travel, free of charge, on public transport and some
private bus and ferry services.

Everyone aged 66 and over, living permanently in Ireland, can get the Free
Travel Scheme.

People with disabilities and carers aged under 66 may also qualify for Free
Travel.

If you qualify for Free Travel and you are married, in a civil partnership or
cohabiting, your partner may travel with you for free if you meet certain
criteria (see ‘Spouses, civil partners and cohabitants’ below).

If you can’t travel alone for medical reasons, you may get Free Travel for a
companion. This allows a person aged over 16 to travel with you for free.

###  **Changes to the Free Travel Scheme in 2024**

From 29 July 2024, you will qualify for the Free Travel Scheme if you are aged
over 17 and under 66, and:

  * Have never been able to drive due to a disability 
  * Have a driving licence and are medically certified as ‘not fit to drive’ for at least 12 months. 

While the change won’t take effect until July, you can download and fill in an
[ application form for Free Travel for people medically certified unfit to
drive (FTM) (pdf)
](https://www.gov.ie/pdf/?file=https://assets.gov.ie/292514/e5291b34-d4e7-43b2-aea3-ea5a832849ad.pdf#page=null)
now.

In this case, your spouse, civil partner, or cohabitant **cannot** accompany
you free of charge when travelling.

##  How to use Free Travel

If you qualify for Free Travel, your [ Public Services Card (PSC)
](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/public-services-card/) will
have FT (for Free Travel) in the top left-hand corner. The letter following it
shows who can travel for free with you:

  * FT-P - you can travel for free 
  * FT+S - your spouse, partner or cohabitant can travel with you for free 
  * FT+C - you can have a person (over 16) travel with you for free 

You must show or scan your Public Services Card to the travel operator when
you are travelling on public transport. Find out more about [ 'How to use your
public services card for free travel'
](https://www.gov.ie/en/service/9a2223-free-travel-pass-how-to-use-it/) .

paper pass, if it is valid.

##  Senior SmartPass for travelling in Northern Ireland

If you are 66 or over and have Free Travel, you can travel free of charge on
all bus and rail services within Northern Ireland using a Senior SmartPass
card.

If you are 66 or over and have Free Travel, you do not need to meet the
residency condition in Northern Ireland to apply for a Senior SmartPass card.

###  How to apply for a Senior SmartPass

To get a Senior SmartPass, you must fill in an application form (FTNI1). You
can get this form from your local Intreo Centre or Social Welfare Branch
Office. It is **not possible to get this form online** .

You should not use a photocopy of the form as each form is barcoded. The
application form must be filled in with **black ink** only and returned **in
person** (not posted) to your Intreo Centre or Social Welfare Branch Office.

You must bring each of the following items with your application form to your
Intreo Centre or Social Welfare Branch Office:

  * Your Irish Free Travel pass/Public Services Card 
  * Proof of your address, (for example, a gas, electricity, phone bill or bank statement) 
  * Proof of your identity, (for example, your driving licence, passport or another form of photo identification) 
  * A recent passport standard colour photograph 

It may take up to 6 weeks to process your application. There is further
information on the [ extension of the Free Travel Scheme
](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/ba6e26-operational-guidelines-free-travel-
scheme/) .

**Travelling with a partner or companion**

A spouse, civil partner, cohabitant or companion cannot travel with you for
free on public transport within Northern Ireland.

However, your Irish Free Travel allows your spouse, civil partner, cohabitant
or companion to travel for free on certain cross-border services between
Ireland and Northern Ireland. For example, a cross-border train journey that
starts in Ireland and ends in Northern Ireland or vice versa.

###  **Renewing and replacing a Senior SmartPass**

Your [ Senior SmartPass ](https://www.nidirect.gov.uk/articles/60-smartpass-
and-senior-65-smartpass#toc-1) will expire after 5 years.

  * If you have electronically used your card within the last 2 years, you will get a new card automatically in the post from [ Translink ](http://www.translink.co.uk/) when your card expires. 
  * If you have not used your card in the last 2 years, you will be sent a renewal application form to fill in. The renewal form is not the same as a first-time application and you do not need to supply a photograph. 
  * If you have never used your card, you will not hear from Translink at all. If you wish to get it renewed, you must contact Translink by email at [ smartpass@translink.co.uk ](mailto:smartpass@translink.co.uk ) , or telephone 00 44 289 075 9129 or 028 90 66 66 30 and they will send you a renewal application. 

If you lose or need to replace your Senior SmartPass for travel in Northern
Ireland, you can fill in [ form (FTNI 2) (pdf)
](https://assets.gov.ie/70986/1fa642da83d442dfb6b4e82b457285e4.pdf) .

###  **Brexit and the Senior SmartPass**

On [ 31 January 2020 the UK exited the EU
](https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2020/01/30/brexit-
council-adopts-decision-to-conclude-the-withdrawal-agreement/) . [ Senior
SmartPass ](https://www.gov.ie/en/service/9bba61-free-travel-scheme/) holders
