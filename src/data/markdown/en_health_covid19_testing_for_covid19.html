#  Testing for COVID-19

  * Introduction 
  * Do I need a COVID-19 test? 
  * COVID-19 test results 
  * Children and COVID-19 testing 
  * More information 

##  Introduction

There are two ways to test for COVID-19:

  * PCR tests are done by a healthcare worker in a hospital, your GP or a private company. They send your sample to a lab where it is tested for COVID-19. 
  * Antigen tests are tests you can do yourself at home. The test sample does not have to go to a lab and you usually get your results in 15 minutes. Antigen tests are quicker but less reliable than a PCR test. In some cases, they may not detect the virus. You can buy antigen tests in pharmacies and supermarkets. 

You can no longer book a PCR test or order antigen test online through the
HSE.

##  Do I need a COVID-19 test?

You do not need to get a COVID-19 test unless your GP or a healthcare worker
in a hospital advises you to be tested. They will then arrange a test for you.

Read about what you should do [ if you have symptoms of COVID-19.
](/en/health/covid19/covid19-isolation-and-restricting/)

You should contact your GP if you have symptoms of COVID-19 and an [
underlying condition which puts you at higher risk of severe illness from
COVID-19 ](https://www2.hse.ie/conditions/covid19/people-at-higher-
risk/overview/) .

You can buy antigen tests in most pharmacies and many supermarkets if you wish
to take a test.

The HSE has [ instructions on how to do an antigen test at home
](https://www2.hse.ie/conditions/covid19/testing/using-antigen-tests/) and [ a
video on how to do an antigen test with a child
](https://www2.hse.ie/conditions/covid19/testing/antigen-tests-for-primary-
school-children/#how-to-do-an-antigen-test-with-your-child) .

###  Healthcare workers and COVID-19 testing

The HSE has [ information about testing for healthcare workers.
](https://healthservice.hse.ie/staff/covid-19-staff-support/testing-for-
healthcare-workers/)

###  Can I get a COVID-19 test for travelling?

COVID-19 tests for [ travel abroad ](/en/travel-and-recreation/travel-
abroad/travelling-abroad-during-covid/) are not provided in the public health
system. Airlines will not accept a HSE test result for travel. If you need a
letter for travel, you need to have a negative test from a private company.

###  Getting a PCR test with a GP

Your GP will no longer refer you to a PCR test centre.

If you are a vulnerable patient, your GP may test you for COVID-19 at their
clinic. If you have a [ medical card ](/en/health/medical-cards-and-gp-visit-
cards/medical-card/) or [ GP visit card ](/en/health/medical-cards-and-gp-
visit-cards/gp-visit-cards/) this will be free. If you are a private patient,
you will have to pay a fee.

If you have symptoms of COVID-19 do not go to the GP clinic. You should phone
your GP if your breathing changes or becomes difficult, or your cough gets
worse.

##  COVID-19 test results

The HSE website explains what your [ test results mean.
](https://www2.hse.ie/conditions/covid19/testing/test-results/#what-your-
results-mean) You can read what to do if you get a [ positive
](/en/health/covid19/testing-for-covid19#l4fda0) or [ negative
](/en/health/covid19/testing-for-covid19#la8e13) test below.

###  Positive COVID-19 test result

If you get a positive COVID-19 test result, you should:

  * [ Self-isolate ](/en/health/covid19/covid19-isolation-and-restricting#l0cdc5) (stay in your room) and avoid contact with people for 5 days 
  * Avoid contact with [ people at higher risk from COVID-19 ](https://www2.hse.ie/conditions/covid19/people-at-higher-risk/overview/#conditions-that-put-you-at-higher-risk) for 10 days after testing positive 

You no longer need to report your positive antigen result.

###  Negative COVID-19 test result

If you have symptoms of COVID-19 and you get a negative antigen or PCR test
result, this does not mean that you do not have COVID-19. It just means that
the virus was not found on the sample that was taken.

You no longer need to report your negative antigen result.

##  Children and COVID-19 testing

Most children do not need to get tested for COVID-19. Antigen tests are not
recommended for children under the age of 4. You can [ read what to do if your
child has symptoms of COVID-19 on the HSE website.
](https://www2.hse.ie/conditions/covid19/symptoms/symptoms-child/)

If your child tests positive for COVID-19, they should stay at home for 3 full
days from the day their symptoms began and avoid contact with other people.

You can watch [ a video from the HSE on how to use antigen tests with your
children ](https://www2.hse.ie/conditions/covid19/testing/antigen-tests-for-
primary-school-children/#how-many-antigen-tests-to-do) .

Check [ when to keep your child home
](https://www2.hse.ie/conditions/covid19/preventing-the-spread/child-
returning-to-school-or-childcare/) from school or childcare and when they can
return after isolation.

If your child has symptoms of COVID-19 or tests positive you can read about [
caring for young children who cannot self-isolate
](/en/health/covid19/covid19-isolation-and-restricting/) .

##  More information

You may need to prove that you have recovered from COVID-19 or have been [
vaccinated for COVID-19 ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/health/health-
services/vaccinations/vaccines-for-covid19/) if you wish to travel abroad.

You can no longer get an [ EU Digital COVID Certificate (DCC) ](/en/travel-
and-recreation/travel-abroad/digital-covid-certificate#l247f3) . However, the
HSE will still give you evidence of your COVID-19 vaccination after you have
been vaccinated.

If you want more information about COVID-19 vaccination certificates, visit
the [ HSE website ](https://www.hse.ie/eng/) or call HSElive on 1800 700 700.
