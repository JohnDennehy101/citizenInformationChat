#  Community Welfare Service and payments

  * What is the Community Welfare Service? 
  * What support can I get from the Community Welfare Service? 
  * How is my application to the Community Welfare Service assessed? 
  * How to apply for a payment from theCommunity Welfare Service 

##  What is the Community Welfare Service?

The Community Welfare Service provides additional financial support to people
on a low income or getting a social welfare payment. It can also support
people in particular hardship or during an emergency.

Community Welfare Officers (CWOs) decide on all applications for financial
support to the Community Welfare Service. They are employed by the [
Department of Social Protection (DSP)
](https://www.gov.ie/en/organisation/department-of-employment-affairs-and-
social-protection/) .

##  What support can I get from the Community Welfare Service?

Community Welfare Officers (CWOs) are responsible for the day-to-day running
of the [ Supplementary Welfare Allowance Scheme ](/en/social-
welfare/supplementary-welfare-schemes/supplementary-welfare-allow/) .

The payments made under this scheme include:

  * A [ weekly Supplementary Welfare Allowance (SWA) ](/en/social-welfare/supplementary-welfare-schemes/supplementary-welfare-allow/)
  * SWA Supplements, for example, [ Diet and Heating Supplements ](/en/social-welfare/supplementary-welfare-schemes/diet-and-heating-supplements/)
  * [ Rent Supplement ](/en/social-welfare/supplementary-welfare-schemes/rent-supplement/)
  * [ Additional Needs Payments ](/en/social-welfare/supplementary-welfare-schemes/additional-needs-payment/)

##  How is my application to the Community Welfare Service assessed?

Your application for financial support will be examined by a Community Welfare
Officer. The CWO will look at all your sources of income and your expenses.
They will then decide if you qualify for a payment.

A payment can be a once off payment or a regular supplement.

The CWO may want to meet with you to help them decide if you should get a
payment.

A CWO can refer you to other state agencies and voluntary organisations
depending on your needs. For example, you may be referred to the [ Money
Advice and Budgeting Service (MABS) ](/en/money-and-tax/personal-
finance/debt/mabs-service/) .

###  Appealing a decision

If you are unhappy with a decision made by a CWO, you may appeal it.

You can appeal a CWO’s decision on a weekly [ Supplementary Welfare Allowance
](/en/social-welfare/supplementary-welfare-schemes/supplementary-welfare-
allow/) , Mortgage or [ Rent Supplement ](/en/social-welfare/supplementary-
welfare-schemes/rent-supplement/) to the Social Welfare Appeals Office.

Other payments such as the [ Additional Needs Payments ](/en/social-
welfare/supplementary-welfare-schemes/additional-needs-payment/) cannot be
appealed to the Social Welfare Appeals Office, but you can request the CWO’s
decision be reviewed by another DSP officer.

There is no charge for getting a decision reviewed or making an appeal.
