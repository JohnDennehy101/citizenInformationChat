#  Transferring to another local authority home

  * Introduction 
  * Transferring to another local authority home in the same area 
  * Swapping local authority homes 
  * More information 

##  Introduction

If you are living in a local authority home and you want to move to a
different local authority home, you should ask your local authority if this is
possible.

Most local authorities will allow you to transfer to another local authority
home in the same area if you meet certain conditions. You may also be able to
swap homes with another local authority tenant, if the local authority agrees
to it.

If you want to move to a local authority home in a different local authority
area, you will have to arrange a swap with another local authority tenant
yourself. You must get approval from both local authorities and meet the
qualifying criteria to do this.

##  Transferring to another local authority home in the same area

If you have a local authority home and want to move to a different one in the
same local authority area, you can register for a transfer on your local
authority’s transfer list.

Each local authority has their own rules for transfers, so the qualifying
criteria can be different depending on where you live. The specific rules for
your area will be outlined in your local authority’s housing allocations
scheme on their website.

Generally, to qualify for a transfer in the same local authority area, you
will need to:

  * Have a valid reason why you want to move 
  * Meet criteria set by your local authority 

For example, your local authority may only accept your request to transfer if
you want to move because:

  * Your home is overcrowded 
  * You want to downsize 
  * You need to transfer for medical or compassionate reasons 
  * You are a victim of anti-social behaviour 
  * There are other exceptional circumstances 

You may also have to meet other conditions about your current tenancy. For
example, you may need to have:

  * Lived in your local authority home for at least 2 years 
  * No [ rent arrears ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/housing/local-authority-and-social-housing/rent-arrears-in-social-housing/)
  * No history of [ anti-social behaviour ](/en/housing/local-authority-and-social-housing/anti-social-behaviour-and-rent-arrears-in-social-housing/)
  * Kept your home in good condition 

**How do I apply for a transfer and what happens next?**

If you meet all your local authorities’ criteria, you apply to them to
transfer to another local authority home.

To apply complete and submit your application form to the local authority.
Application forms are usually available on your local authority’s website.

Your local authority will review your application and let you know if you
qualify for a transfer. If you qualify, you will be added to a transfer list.

Then when you are next on the transfer list and suitable accommodation becomes
available, the local authority will contact you to offer you the home.

##  Swapping local authority homes

You may be able to arrange a private transfer by finding someone who wants to
swap their local authority home with yours. Both households must meet certain
criteria in this situation. For example, the swap must not mean there will be
overcrowding in either home and the local authority must agree to the swap.

You can also arrange a private transfer with someone from a different local
authority, once the accommodation is suitable for both households and the 2
local authorities agree to the swap.

To apply, you must complete an application form and submit it to your local
authority. You can usually get this form on your local authority’s website.

If you want swap homes, you may be able to find details of other people who
want to swap in your local authority’s office, in local newspapers or online.
