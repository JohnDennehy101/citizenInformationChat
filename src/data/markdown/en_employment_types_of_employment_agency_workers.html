##  Introduction

Agency workers, also known as _temporary agency workers_ have an agreement
with an agency to work for someone else.

For example, a secretary might work for an employment agency and temporarily
do work for an office while one of their employees is on leave.

While agency workers do not have all the same employment rights as permanent
workers they do have the right to equal treatment in basic working and
employment conditions.

##  Who is an agency worker?

You are an agency worker if you are employed by an employment agency and
temporarily assigned to work for another organisation (the hirer).

###  Who is not an agency worker?

The following workers are not considered agency workers:

  * Independent contractors or business owners placed by an employment agency. In this case, the contractor is a client of the hirer. 
  * Some workers under a managed service contract (for example, cleaning contracts), where the contractor manages and delivers the service. 
  * Workers on the [ Work Placement Experience Programme ](/en/employment/unemployment-and-redundancy/employment-support-schemes/work-placement-experience-programme/) , [ Community Employment ](/en/employment/unemployment-and-redundancy/employment-support-schemes/community-employment-scheme/) , [ TÚS ](/en/employment/unemployment-and-redundancy/employment-support-schemes/tus/) or any Department of Social Protection vocational training or re-training scheme. 

You can get more information about [ understanding your employment status
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/employment/types-of-
employment/understanding-your-employment-status/) .

##  Who is considered my employer?

Your employer depends on the specific employment rights you want to enforce.

In most cases (exceptions mentioned below), **the party who pays your wages**
is typically considered your employer. This can be either the employment
agency or the client company.

The Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2003 clarifies that agency
workers are insurably employed and the person who pays the wages is the
employer for [ PRSI (pay-related social insurance) ](/en/social-welfare/irish-
social-welfare-system/social-insurance-prsi/paying-social-insurance/)
purposes.

**Exceptions**

In cases involving [ unfair dismissal
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/employment/unemployment-and-
redundancy/dismissal/unfair-dismissal/) legislation and compliance with [
health and safety
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/employment/employment-rights-and-
conditions/health-and-safety/health-safety-work/) requirements, your employer
is the person or organisation for whom you actually work, rather than the
agency.

##  Entitlement to equal treatment

Agency workers must have equal treatment with regular workers from their first
day at work.

As an agency worker, you are entitled to the same basic employment conditions
as if you were directly recruited by the hirer.

These basic employment and working conditions are:

**Conditions** |  **Details**  
---|---  
**Working time** |  Covers working time, rest periods, breaks, night work, annual leave, and public holidays.   
**Pay** |  **Includes:** Basic pay, shift premium, piece work, overtime, unsocial hours worked, and Sunday work.  **Excludes:** Occupational pension schemes, bonuses, maternity pay or benefit in kind.   
**Access to Facilities and Information** |  Covers childcare, canteen and parking facilities and information about permanent job opportunities.   
  
###  Legislation covering equal treatment

The rules on equal treatment are set out in the [ Protection of Employees
(Temporary Agency Work) Act 2012
](https://revisedacts.lawreform.ie/eli/2012/act/13/front/revised/en/html) .

The Workplace Relations Commission has [ guidance on the Protection of
Employees (Temporary Agency Work) Act 2012 (pdf)
](https://www.workplacerelations.ie/en/Publications_Forms/Guide_to_Protection_of_Employees_Temporary_Agency_Work_Act.pdf)
.

###  Part-time agency workers

If you are a part-time agency worker, you can only compare yourself to a
comparable full-time agency worker. These rules are set out in the [
Protection of Employees (Part-Time Work) Act 2001
](https://revisedacts.lawreform.ie/eli/2001/act/45/front/revised/en/html) .

##  Additional legal protections for agency workers

As an agency worker, you also have certain rights under the following
employment legislation:

[ Unfair Dismissals Acts 1977–2015
](https://revisedacts.lawreform.ie/eli/1977/act/10/front/revised/en/html)

[ Redundancy Payments Acts 1967–2022
](https://revisedacts.lawreform.ie/eli/1967/act/21/front/revised/en/html)

[ Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Acts 1973–2005
](https://revisedacts.lawreform.ie/eli/1973/act/4/front/revised/en/html)

[ Organisation of Working Time Act 1997
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1997/en/act/pub/0020/index.html)

[ Payment of Wages Act 1991
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1991/en/act/pub/0025/index.html)

[ Maternity Protection Acts 1994 and 2022
](https://revisedacts.lawreform.ie/eli/1994/act/34/front/revised/en/html)

[ Employment Equality Acts 1998–2021
](https://revisedacts.lawreform.ie/eli/1998/act/21/front/revised/en/html)

It is important to know who is responsible for ensuring compliance with
employment protection legislation - the agency or the hirer. See ‘Who is
considered my employer?’ above.

###  Legislation that does not apply to agency workers

The Protection of Employees (Fixed-Term Work) Act 2003 applies to most
employees on [ fixed-term contracts.
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/employment/employment-rights-and-
conditions/contracts-of-employment/rights-of-fixed-term-workers/)

It does not apply to agency workers placed by a temporary work agency in
another organisation. However, the Act does apply to agency workers directly
employed by an employment agency.

##  Protection against victimisation

You are protected against being [ victimised
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/employment/enforcement-and-
redress/victimisation-at-work/) as an agency worker for reporting breaches of
the Protection of Employees (Temporary Agency Work) Act 2012.

This means the hirer or agency cannot penalise you through dismissal, unfair
treatment or unfavourable changes in your employment conditions.

##  Making a complaint

You can make a complaint to the Workplace Relations Commission about a breach
of your rights as an agency worker, using the [ online complaint form
](https://www.workplacerelations.ie/en/e-complaint_form/) .

You must make the complaint **within 6 months** of the dispute. The time limit
can be extended for a further 6 months, if there is a _reasonable cause_ which
prevented you from bringing the complaint within the normal time limit.

##  More information

You can find out more about the rights of agency workers from Workplace
Relations Commission's [ Information and Customer Service

###  Regulation of employment agencies

Employment agencies in Ireland are regulated by the [ Employment Agency Act
1971 ](https://revisedacts.lawreform.ie/eli/1971/act/27/front/revised/en/html)
. Under the Act, an employment agency must have a licence to operate its
business. Details of the [ application procedure
](https://www.workplacerelations.ie/en/what_you_should_know/employer-
obligations/employment-agencies/agencies.html) and [ a list of licensed
employment agencies (pdf)
](https://www.workplacerelations.ie/en/publications_forms/current_employment_agency_list.pdf)
are available on the Workplace Relations Commission’s website.
