#  PAYE overpayments and underpayments of tax

  * If you have overpaid tax

##  Introduction

You can check whether you paid the right amount of tax for previous years and
whether the right information is being used to make your tax deductions this
year.

If you have paid too much tax, you can get a tax refund. You must claim a tax
refund within the 4 years following the year you paid the tax. To claim tax
back you must make a tax return.

If you have paid too little tax, you will owe Revenue the difference between
what you paid and what you should have paid. There are different options to
repay the tax depending on the amount you owe.  

##  How to check your tax credits for this year

Your tax credit certificate shows the [ tax credits ](/en/money-and-
tax/tax/income-tax-credits-and-reliefs/introduction-to-income-tax-credits-and-
reliefs/) that your employer is deducting from your tax bill this year. You
can view your tax certificate online using [ myAccount
](https://www.ros.ie/myaccount-web/home.html) .

If you find out during the year that your tax credits are not correct, contact
Revenue so that any refund due can be paid to you by your employer. It is also
important to check that you are not claiming tax credits you are not entitled
to, as this will result in an underpayment of tax.

##  How to check if you are due a tax refund or owe tax for a previous year

You can use [ myAccount ](https://www.ros.ie/myaccount-web/home.html) to check
whether you have paid the correct amount of tax in the previous 4 years. You
can see a statement that shows if you have paid too much tax or too little
tax. This is called a Preliminary End of Year Statement. It is based on the
information Revenue has.

There may be other information that could affect how much you owe. For
example, you may have other income or you may be entitled to tax credits that
you have not claimed. To get a final statement, you must [ get a Statement of
Liability ](how_to_review_your_tax_for_PAYE_taxpayers.en.html#lab7df) .

For detailed information about how to get a preliminary and final statement,
see [ How to review your tax for PAYE taxpayers ](/en/money-and-
tax/tax/income-tax/how-to-review-your-paye-tax/) .

##  If you have overpaid tax

You may have overpaid tax if you become unemployed or are out of work sick.
Find out more about [ claiming a tax refund if you are unemployed or out of
work sick ](/en/money-and-tax/tax/income-tax/tax-refund-when-unemployed-or-
out-of-work-sick/) .

You may also have overpaid tax if your tax credits are incorrect or you
haven’t claimed tax relief for certain expenses. Find out more about the [ tax
credits and reliefs ](/en/money-and-tax/tax/income-tax-credits-and-
reliefs/introduction-to-income-tax-credits-and-reliefs/) you may be entitled
to claim.

###  How to get a tax refund

If your Preliminary End of Year Statement shows that you have paid too much
tax, you can claim a tax refund by [ making a tax return
](https://revenue.ie/en/jobs-and-pensions/paye-income-tax-returns/index.aspx)
.

Refunds are paid by cheque or bank transfer.

##  If you have underpaid tax

There are various [ reasons why you may have underpaid tax
](https://www.revenue.ie/en/jobs-and-pensions/end-of-year-
process/underpayment-position.aspx) .

For example, it may be due to [ the taxation of social protection payments
](https://www.revenue.ie/en/jobs-and-pensions/taxation-of-social-welfare-
payments/index.aspx) or, in 2020, the [ Pandemic Unemployment Payment
](/en/social-welfare/unemployed-people/covid19-pandemic-unemployment-payment/)
and [ Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme ](/en/employment/unemployment-and-
redundancy/covid19-temporary-wage-subsidy-scheme/) .

###  How to repay tax you owe

If your Statement of Liability shows that you owe tax of less than €6,000, you
have the option to:

  * Pay all or part of it through myAccount 
  * Pay all or the remaining part of it by having your tax credits reduced for up to 4 years 

If the amount you owe is over €6,000, you can pay the amount through myAccount
or contact Revenue to discuss repayment options.

An underpayment will remain on your tax record with Revenue until it is paid.
You may have to pay interest and penalties if you owe tax to Revenue. If you
refuse to repay tax that is due, Revenue can take you to court.

underpaid tax, and what to do if you have, read about [ How to review your tax
