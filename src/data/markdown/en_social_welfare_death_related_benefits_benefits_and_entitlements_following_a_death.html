Benefits and entitlements following a death

#  Benefits and entitlements following a death

  * Introduction 

##  Introduction

After a bereavement you may need financial support. The Department of Social
Protection (DSP) provides certain once-off payments to help out families
during this difficult time. Your [ local Community Welfare Officer
](https://www.gov.ie/en/collection/cb07d7-supplementary-welfare-allowance-swa-
list-of-offices-administering-swa/) deals with some of these payments.

You must have made a certain number of [ PRSI contributions ](/en/social-
welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/social-insurance-prsi/paying-social-
insurance/) to be eligible for some social welfare payments. You may be
eligible for other payments, if you pass a means test or if you are in urgent
need. Time limits apply for many payments, so apply as early as is possible.

You cannot be expected to do everything right away, but if the deceased was
getting a social welfare payment or you were claiming for them as a dependant
or you were getting a Carer's Allowance to look after them, it's important
that you notify the Department within the first few days of the death.

Notifying the Department does not mean the payment will be taken back
immediately. In many cases, the spouse, civil partner, cohabitant, parent or
carer may continue to receive a [ payment for 6 weeks following the death
](/en/social-welfare/death-related-benefits/social-welfare-payments-following-
a-death/) .

###  Help with funeral costs

You can get help with the cost of the funeral:

  * The [ Widowed or Surviving Civil Partner Grant ](/en/social-welfare/death-related-benefits/widowed-parents-bereavement-grant/) is a once-off payment to widows/widowers/surviving civil partners with dependent children.This payment was formerly called the Widowed Parent Grant. 
  * If someone dies from an accident at work, a [ Funeral Grant ](/en/social-welfare/death-related-benefits/special-funeral-grant/) is available. 

Whether you qualify or not for one of the above grants you may be eligible for
an Additional Needs Payment to [ help with funeral costs if you are on a low
income ](/en/social-welfare/supplementary-welfare-schemes/additional-needs-
payment/) . Each case is decided on its merits. The Community Welfare Service
prefers if you apply before the funeral takes place, but in practice, most
people apply afterwards.

In many cases a payment or a grant cannot be paid until all the necessary
documentation is received. If you are claiming the grant, you are responsible
for the production of certificates, documents and any information required,
for example:

  * Death certificate 
  * Birth certificate 
  * Marriage or Civil Partnership certificate (to prove your relationship to the deceased) 
  * Funeral receipts 
  * The deceased person's [ Personal Public Service (PPS) number ](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/personal-public-service-number/)
  * Your PPS number may also be required 

###  Main payments

If you were living with or dependent on the deceased, any current benefits or
payments you are getting may change, or you may be able to claim additional
benefits. Depending on your income and circumstances you may be entitled to a
social welfare payment in your own right, for example:

A [ Widow's, Widower's or Surviving Civil Partner's Contributory Pension
](/en/social-welfare/death-related-benefits/widowed-persons-contrib-pension/)
and related social welfare benefits may be payable if either you or your
deceased spouse or civil partner has enough PRSI contributions.

A [ Widow's, Widower's or Surviving Civil Partner's (Non-Contributory) Pension
](/en/social-welfare/death-related-benefits/widowed-persons-non-contrib-
pension/) is paid to widowed people or surviving civil partners without
dependent children, who do not qualify for a contributory pension and who pass
a means test.

A [ Guardian's payment ](/en/social-welfare/death-related-benefits/guardian-
and-orphan-payments/) is paid to the child's guardian up to the child's 18th
birthday or 22nd birthday if he or she is in full-time education.

A [ One-Parent Family Payment ](/en/social-welfare/families-and-children/one-
parent-family-payment/) can be paid to you if you are parenting alone as a
result of the death of your spouse, civil partner or cohabitant. If you also
qualify for a Widow's, Widower's or Surviving Civil Partner's Contributory
Pension you will have to choose which payment is of most benefit to you
because you cannot get both.

If a person dies because of an accident at work or occupational disease, [
Death Benefit under the Occupational Injuries Scheme ](/en/social-
welfare/death-related-benefits/death-benefits-under-oib/) may be paid to their
surviving spouse or civil partner.

###  Additional payments

Bereavement can cause financial difficulties. The [ Supplementary Welfare
Allowance Scheme ](/en/social-welfare/supplementary-welfare-schemes/) provides
financial support to people with low incomes. You may qualify for a weekly
supplement payment under the scheme to meet certain special needs, for
example, help with rent and fuel costs. In addition, payments can also be made
for urgent or exceptional needs.

There are specific rules about taxation in the year of a person's death, for
example, a tax refund may be due. There are also extra credits for parents in
the years following the death of a spouse or civil partner. [ Find out more
information about tax in the year of death and the years following a death
](/en/money-and-tax/tax/income-tax-credits-and-reliefs/income-tax-credits-and-
reliefs-following-a-death/) .
