##  What is signing on?

If you lose your job, are made redundant, laid off or if your working hours
are reduced you may qualify for a social welfare payment, either Jobseeker’s
Allowance or Jobseeker’s Benefit. When you apply for a jobseeker’s payment you
declare that you are available for work, fit for work, looking for work but
can't find work. This is also known as _signing on_ .

##  The difference between Jobseeker’s Benefit and Jobseeker’s Allowance

To get [ Jobseeker’s Benefit (JB) ](/en/social-welfare/unemployed-
people/jobseekers-benefit/) you must have enough social insurance (PRSI)
contributions. JB rates are graduated according to earnings. If you are
affected by this, it may be of greater benefit for you to claim Jobseeker's
Allowance.

To get [ Jobseeker’s Allowance (JA) ](/en/social-welfare/unemployed-
people/jobseekers-allowance/) you must pass a means test. A means test is when
your income is calculated to see whether it falls below a certain level. If it
falls below a certain level, you can get Jobseeker’s Allowance.

You will always be assessed for Jobseeker’s Benefit first, unless you have
never worked before. When you apply for Jobseeker’s Benefit you are asked if
you want to be assessed for Jobseeker’s Allowance. This means that if you
don’t qualify for Jobseeker’s Benefit, you will not need to apply a second
time to be assessed for Jobseeker’s Allowance.

**If you work for part of a week** , you may qualify for a jobseeker's payment
for the days you are unemployed.

**If you leave work voluntarily or as a result of misconduct** , you cannot
get a jobseeker’s payment for 9 weeks. However, if you have ‘good cause’ to
leave voluntarily, for example, any changes in working conditions such as a
reduction in pay, harassment or abuse from your employer, you may get your
payment. The Deciding Officer in your local Intreo Centre or Social Welfare
Branch Office will decide whether you had good cause to leave voluntarily.

**If you are self-employed** you may get a jobseeker’s payment if you closed
your business or the amount of work you are getting has sufficiently reduced.
Find out more about [ self-employed people and unemployment ](/en/social-
welfare/unemployed-people/self-employed-and-unemployment/) .

##  Intreo - the integrated employment and support service

[ Intreo ]( https://www.gov.ie/en/directory/category/e1f4b5-intreo-offices/)
provides a one-stop shop for employment services and income supports with a
range of personalised supports to jobseekers including:

  * Information on all the income supports provided by the Department of Social Protection, for example, jobseeker’s payments, back to work and back to education payments, one-parent family payments and pensions 
  * [ Help and advice on employment, training and personal development opportunities ](/en/social-welfare/unemployed-people/employment-supports/)
  * Personalised support to help you enter the workforce 
  * Self-service facilities with information and guidance on employment and training opportunities 
  * Information on job vacancies through [ jobsireland.ie ](http://www.jobsireland.ie/)

Details of Intreo Centre locations are published on [ gov.ie
](https://www.gov.ie/en/directory/category/e1f4b5-intreo-offices/) .

##  Signing on for the first time

Applying for a jobseeker’s payment is also known as signing on.

###  Online applications

You can apply for Jobseekers Benefit or Jobseeker’s Allowance online at
MyWelfare.ie.

When you log in, you will be asked for some personal and financial
information, as well as details of your employment, training or education
history. You will also be asked to upload or post any supporting documents
that are needed.

You must have a basic MyGovID account to apply online.

###  Paper applications

You can apply for Jobseekers Benefit or Jobseeker’s Allowance using the
application form UP 1.

If you are making a repeat claim (less than 6 months since your last claim),
you fill in form [ UP 6 (pdf)
](https://assets.gov.ie/37365/2de1c35ba1ab498f819ee65731aa4086.pdf) .

Find out more about requesting an application form. Forms are also available
from your local Intreo Centre or Social Welfare Branch Office.

You will also need certain documents when you apply for a jobseeker’s payment.
If you do not have these documents to hand, you should apply anyway and supply
them later. You should remember that a delay in applying for a jobseeker’s
payment may mean that you lose out on your full entitlements.

You can get help to fill in your application form at your Intreo Centre,
Social Welfare Branch Office or Citizens Information Centre.

All jobseekers have to register for a Public Services Card if they have not
been issued with one already.

Depending on your personal profile, you may be given an appointment for a
further meeting with a DSP case officer. At this meeting your case officer
will discuss your options with you and agree your Personal Progression Plan to
prepare you to find employment. You will get ongoing advice and support to
help you meet the goals in your Personal Progression Plan.

If you do not keep to the conditions of your jobseeker’s payment, your payment
can be reduced and eventually stopped altogether.

](http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/Intreo---Frequently-Asked-Questions.aspx) and
[ Your Pathway to Work ](http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/Your-Pathway-to-
Work.aspx) .

##  Getting paid

Your jobseeker’s payment is paid weekly by the Department of Social
Protection.

Jobseekers collect their weekly payment at their local Post Office.

Your jobseeker's payment can be paid into your bank account or another
financial institution if you are also working part-time or short-time or on a
casual basis.

If you are over 62, you can collect your payment at your local Post Office or
paid into your bank account or another financial institution.

You can collect your jobseeker’s payment weekly from your nearest post office.
You must bring valid photographic identification (photo ID) or your [ Public
Services Card ](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/public-
services-card/) with you to collect your payment. Valid photo ID includes a
driving licence, a passport or a IRP card.

##  Signing on every month

When you get your jobseeker’s payment, you will have to sign a declaration,
usually every month, that you are still unemployed and qualify for a
jobseeker’s payment. You may be asked to sign on more or less frequently.

Your Intreo Centre will let you know how often you must sign on. You will be
given a place, date and time to sign on.

If you don’t sign on the set day or by the end of the following day, your
payment is suspended. If you don’t sign on, your payment may be stopped.

##  Other benefits

Supplementary Welfare Allowance provides a basic weekly allowance to eligible
people who have little or no income. If your weekly income is below the
Supplementary Welfare Allowance rate for your family size, a payment may be
made to bring your income up to the appropriate Supplementary Welfare
Allowance rate.

If you have claimed any social welfare payment, but it has not been paid and
you have no other income, you may qualify for [ Supplementary Welfare
Allowance ](/en/social-welfare/supplementary-welfare-schemes/supplementary-
welfare-allow/) while you are waiting for your payment.

If you get Jobseeker’s Allowance or Jobseeker’s Benefit or Supplementary
Welfare Allowance you may be entitled to other social welfare and health
benefits.

If your income is below a certain amount you may get a [ medical card
](/en/health/medical-cards-and-gp-visit-cards/medical-card/) or a [ GP visit
card ](/en/health/medical-cards-and-gp-visit-cards/gp-visit-cards/) .

You may get [ help with paying your rent ](/en/social-welfare/supplementary-
welfare-schemes/rent-supplement/) . If you are in local authority housing you
should contact your local authority and ask for a review of your rent.

You may get help with the cost of uniforms and footwear for your children. The
[ Back to School Clothing and Footwear Allowance Scheme ](/en/social-
welfare/families-and-children/back-to-school-clothing-and-footwear-allowance/)
operates from 1 June to 30 September each year.

If you have an exceptional or urgent need, for example, help with a funeral
bill, you can apply for [ a range of discretionary payments ](/en/social-
welfare/supplementary-welfare-schemes/additional-needs-payment/) from the
DSP's representative (formerly known as the Community Welfare Officer). [
