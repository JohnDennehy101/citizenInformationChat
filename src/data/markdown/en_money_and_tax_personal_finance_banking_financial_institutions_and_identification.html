#  Proof of identity to open a bank account

  * Introduction 
  * Rules 
  * How to apply 

##  Introduction

When you are [ opening an account with a financial institution ](/en/money-
and-tax/personal-finance/banking/opening-a-bank-account/) such as a bank or
credit union, it must establish proof of your identity. This requirement is
set down in [ anti-money laundering legislation ](/en/money-and-tax/personal-
finance/banking/money-laundering-in-ireland/) .

The Central Bank has an explainer on [ why you must prove your identity when
opening a bank account ](https://centralbank.ie/consumer-hub/explainers/why-
must-i-prove-my-identity-when-obtaining-a-financial-services-product) .

##  Rules

When you are opening an account, you cannot use the same document as proof of
both your identity and your address. You will need at least one form of
photographic identification (photo ID) to prove your identity and at least one
document to prove your address.

Examples of documents that banks may accept as **photo ID** include:

  * Valid passport 
  * Valid driving licence 
  * Irish Government Travel Document 
  * Temporary Residence Certificate 
  * Irish Residency Permit 

Your proof of identity must be in date. The name on your photo ID must match
the name on your proof of address.

Examples of documents that banks may accept as **proof of your address**
include:

  * Current utility bill (such as a gas, electricity or telephone or mobile phone bill) 
  * Current car or home insurance policy that shows your address 
  * Document issued by a government department that shows your address 
  * Copy of your Tax Credit Certificate (TCC) 
  * Statement of Liability (previously P21) from Revenue 

Your proof of address must be less than 6 months old (or 12 months for an
insurance policy).

In some cases a bank may ask you for your [ PPS number ](/en/social-
welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/personal-public-service-number/) â€“ for
example, if you are claiming tax relief on the interest paid on a mortgage
loan.

Copies of the documents you use to establish your identity must be kept by the
bank for 5 years after an account is closed.

**If you cannot provide the standard documents**

If you cannot provide the standard documents requested, contact the bank for
advice on alternatives that may be acceptable.

There is a [ guide to opening a bank account for refugees and asylum seekers
(pdf) ](https://bpfi.ie/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Final-BPFI-Guide-to-
Opening-Bank-Accounts-in-Ireland-for-Protection-Applicants-Final.pdf) . You
can also download the [ guide for international protection applicants in other
languages ](https://bpfi.ie/customer-assist/) .

**Requests for information on transactions**

Bank staff must know the nature of their customers' business and can ask for
information about the level and type of business that is likely to be
transacted through the account. You can also be asked to provide confirmation
of the source of your funds and to give reasons for carrying out certain
transactions.

##  How to apply

Contact your bank or financial institution to get full details of the
identification it requires.
