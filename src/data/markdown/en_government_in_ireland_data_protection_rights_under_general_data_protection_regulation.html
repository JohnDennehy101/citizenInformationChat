#  How to access your personal data under the GDPR

  * What personal data can I access? 
  * How do I make an access request under data protection law? 
  * How will the company or organisation deal with my request? 
  * Can my request be refused? 
  * After you receive your personal data

  * The right to be forgotten 
  * Further information and contacts 

##  Data protection terms

You have a fundamental right of access to your personal data from data
controllers under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

**Personal data** is information that relates to you, or can identify you,
either by itself or together with other available information. Personal data
can include your name, address, contact details, an identification number, IP
address, CCTV footage, access cards, audio-visual or audio recordings of you,
and location data.

Under data protection law, if an organisation or company is holding or using
your personal data, you are known as a **data subject** .

The organisation or company holding or using that data, is known as a **data
controller** . However, the data controller can allow another person,
organisation or company, known as a **data processor** , to process your
personal data on its behalf.

Doing anything with your personal data, including storing it, is known as
**processing** .

##  What personal data can I access?

You have the right to get a copy of any personal data which an organisation
holds on you.

You also have the right to find out if your personal data is being processed.

If your personal data is being stored or used (processed), you have the right
to know:

  * The reason why it is being processed 
  * Where the personal data came from 
  * Who your personal data will be shared with 
  * How long your personal data will be kept 
  * The categories of personal data being processed 
  * How to exercise your data protection rights 

The data processor should also tell you about your right to make a complaint
to the [ Data Protection Commissioner ](https://www.dataprotection.ie/) .

###  Special Category Data

Some personal data is very sensitive and special rules apply to this
information. These special categories include information that reveals any of
the following:

  * Your race or ethnic origin 
  * Your political opinions 
  * Your religious or philosophical beliefs 
  * Your trade union membership 
  * Your health 
  * Any biometric information (for example, your fingerprints) or genetic data 
  * Your sexual orientation or sex life 

The processing of this information is only allowed where you have given your
explicit consent or where the information is absolutely necessary to meet
other legal requirements. For example, you may have to inform your employer of
your nationality to show that you have the legal right to work in Ireland.

##  How do I make an access request under data protection law?

There is no set way to make an access request but the following general advice
can help you to avoid delays or confusion.

###  Make your request in writing

Ask as soon as possible and in writing. This can either be by letter or email.
Seeking your personal data is known as _making an access request_ or a _data
subject access request_ . You should state in the letter or email that it is
an access request. This means that both you and the data controller will have
a record of the request and its content if an issue arises later. Some large
companies allow you to automatically download your personal information
directly through their website.

###  Contact the relevant data protection officer

Many large organisations have a Data Protection Officer (or DPO) and they are
generally the best person to contact about your request for information. You
should be able to find their contact details in the privacy policy or ‘contact
us’ section of the organisation’s website. Where there is no specific email
address for a data access request, you should use the organisation’s general
contact details.

###  Be specific

Make your request as specific as possible in relation to the personal data
that you wish to access unless you want to access all the personal data that
is held about you. Remember to specify whether you want the information in
electronic format (as computer files) or in hard copy (on paper).

###  Send proof of your identity

Provide some additional, identifying information about yourself if needed. You
may need to provide more than just your name because the organisation may have
records on other people with the same name as you. The organisation may ask
you to provide further evidence of your identity.

###  Costs

There is generally no fee for making an access request.

The main exception to this is where your access request is considered
‘manifestly unfounded or excessive’. For example, if you continue to make the
same access request even though it has already been dealt with. If a data
controller can prove that your request is manifestly unfounded or excessive,
they can charge a reasonable fee for the administrative costs of providing the
information requested.

They may also charge a fee based on administrative costs if you ask for
additional copies of the information.

##  How will the company or organisation deal with my request?

The data controller must respond to your request within one month.

If the request is complex or involves a large amount of information, the data
controller can extend the time to respond by a further two months. You should
receive a written explanation for any extension within the initial one-month
period.

If your request is very broad and requires the data controller to provide a
large amount of information and documents, you may be asked to reduce the
number of documents containing personal data requested. However, you can
insist on receiving all the information and documentation held. If you do, it
may take longer to comply with your access request.

In general, the data controller should respond to your access request in the
same format the request was made, or in the way in which you specifically
asked for a response. For example, if you emailed your request, the data
controller should provide the information by email, unless you request
otherwise.

##  Can my request be refused?

A data controller can refuse access to some or all of your data where:

  * Providing your personal data has an impact on the rights of others 
  * Your personal data is listed with the personal data of others (In these cases, the data controller may remove the personal data of others to provide you with your data) 
  * Your personal data is in a document that has trade secrets, confidential information or intellectual 
  * The request is considered ‘manifestly unfounded or excessive’ (for example, if you made a request in the recent past and were told that the data controller had no personal data relating to you) 

By law, access to your personal data may also be refused in relation to
processing carried out:

  * For electoral purposes, such as publishing a roll of electors 
  * By the [ Electoral Commission ](/en/government-in-ireland/elections-and-referenda/voting/electoral-commission/)
  * In the administration of tax and duties 
  * To safeguard Cabinet confidentiality 
  * When defending legal claims 

These exceptions are listed in [ Section 60 of the Data Protection Act 2018
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2018/act/7/section/60/enacted/en/html) .

##  After you receive your personal data

When you receive your personal data after an access request, you have several
other data protection rights.

If your personal data is inaccurate, you have the right to have the data
corrected without delay.

If your personal data is incomplete, you have the right to have the data
completed. This includes by providing supplementary information.

You can ask for your data to be deleted in some situations (see ‘The right to
be forgotten’ below)

In some limited cases, you may be able to object to further processing of your
personal data or its transfer to another processor.

###  What can I do if I am unhappy with the outcome of an access request?

If you are unhappy with the way your access request was processed, you can
make a complaint to the [ Data Protection Commission (DPC)
](https://www.dataprotection.ie/) .

The DPC is Ireland’s independent authority with responsibility for upholding
the right of people in the EU to have their personal data protected. It
monitors compliance with GDPR and other data protection legislation and deals
with complaints in relation to data protection breaches. The [ DPC website
](https://www.dataprotection.ie/) contains helpful explanations of data
protection law.

You may be unhappy with the way your request was handled because:

  * There was no response or a delayed response to your access request 
  * The response to the request was incomplete 
  * You believe the data controller wrongly relied on exemptions to not share your personal data with you 

###  How do I make a complaint?

Complete the [ DPC’s online complaint form
](https://forms.dataprotection.ie/contact) . You will be asked to provide
evidence to support your complaint. This includes:

  * Evidence of your access request 
  * Correspondence between you (or your legal representative) and the data controller and 
  * information in support of your belief that the data controller holds your personal Information 

##  Access to particular types of personal data

This section covers the following particular types of personal data or
records:

  * Children’s personal data 
  * Medical records 
  * Garda records 
  * People who have died 

###  Children’s personal data

Children have the same data protection rights as adults and can make access
requests. However, they are given specific protection with regard to their
personal data. This is because they may be less aware of the risks and
consequences of sharing their personal data. Also, they may be less aware of
the safeguards available and their rights in relation to how their personal
information is processed.

Parents and guardians may also be able to make access requests or exercise any
other data protection right on behalf of their children. If a request is made
by a parent or guardian, the data controller must consider the nature and
circumstances of the request, including the age, capacity and views of the
child and the child’s best interests.

###  Medical records

Your medical records are your personal information and you are entitled to
access them.

If you are a patient in a public or publicly-funded hospital, or have a
medical card or GP visit card, you can seek access in the following ways:

  * Make an access request under data protection law. 
  * Make an access request under the [ Freedom of Information Act ](/en/government-in-ireland/how-government-works/standards-and-accountability/freedom-of-information/) . 
  * Write to the service provider or Health Service Executive and ask for your records. 

You may have to provide information to help them locate your file, including
your date of birth, current and previous addresses, the contacts you had with
specific services and approximate dates

Under data protection law, you can be refused access to your medical records
if disclosure would give rise to serious harm to your physical or mental
health. You can read [ more about access to medical records
](/en/health/legal-matters-and-health/access-to-medical-records/) .

###  Garda records

You can ask An Garda Síochána for a copy of any personal data that it has
about you. When you make an access request to the Gardaí, you are generally
entitled to:

  * Get a copy of the personal data being kept about you 
  * Be told why the data is being kept 
  * Be told the identity of anyone that the Gardaí has shared the data with 
  * Be told how the Gardaí obtained the data (unless this would be against public interest, for example, cause a risk of harm to someone else) 

You can make a request for your personal data using the [ Garda Síochána
subject access request form (pdf) ](https://www.garda.ie/en/about-us/online-
services/data-protection-foi-police-certificates/an-garda-
siochana-f20-october-2019-.pdf) . Post the completed form to the address on
the form or email it to [ DataProtection@Garda.ie
](mailto:DataProtection@Garda.ie) .

The Gardaí can refuse your request for personal data and withhold that
information in the following situations:

  * Your request for data would identify someone else. This also applies to the Gardaí's obligation to give you details of the source of the information. If the source of the information identifies somebody else, the Gardaí can withhold it 
  * They have to refuse so as to prevent, detect or investigate crime, or to arrest or prosecute offenders 
  * There are existing or expected legal proceedings or claims 

You can read more about [ accessing your Garda record ](/en/justice/law-and-
rights/access-to-garda-records/) .

###  Deceased people

In Ireland, GDPR rules for the processing of personal data do not generally
apply to those who have died. Access may be possible under [ Freedom of
Information laws. ](/en/government-in-ireland/how-government-works/standards-
and-accountability/freedom-of-information/)

##  Accessing records under Freedom of Information

You can also access your personal information under [ freedom of information
(FOI) ](/en/government-in-ireland/how-government-works/standards-and-
accountability/freedom-of-information/) . This only applies to information
held by public bodies (for example, government departments, local authorities
and public hospitals).

Your rights under FOI are similar to your rights under GDPR. FOI allows you to
access records containing your “personal information” and the data protection
regime grants access to your “personal data”.

Access requests can be made under FOI and data protection at the same time,
and you have similar rights in relation to the correction of any inaccurate
personal information.

There is no time limit to access personal information in respect of both, and
similar rules apply in relation to the organisation’s obligation to disclose.
Making access requests for personal information are generally free under both.

In many cases, there won’t be a material difference between the two systems
when making an access request in respect of your personal data from a public
body. However, there are some important differences in some areas. You can use
both systems at the same time or one after the other.

##  The right to be forgotten

You have the right to have your data erased, without undue delay, if one of
the following grounds applies:

  * Where your personal data is no longer necessary in relation to the purpose for which it was collected or processed. 
  * Where you withdraw your consent to the processing and there is no other lawful basis for processing the data. 
  * Where you object to the processing and there is no overriding legitimate grounds for continuing the processing 
  * Where you object to the processing and your personal data is being processed for direct marketing purposes 
  * Where your personal data has been unlawfully processed. 
  * Where your personal data has to be erased in order to comply with a legal obligation. 
  * Where your personal data has been collected in relation to the offer of ‘information society services’ (for example, social media) to a child.
