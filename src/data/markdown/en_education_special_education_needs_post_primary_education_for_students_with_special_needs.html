##  Students with special educational needs

Students with [ special educational needs ](/en/education/special-education-
needs/special-education/) may be in ordinary classes in mainstream post-
primary schools or in special classes in these schools or in special schools.
They may get help from special education teachers and care support from
special needs assistants (SNAs).

##  Mainstream schools

Post-primary students with special educational needs may attend a mainstream
post-primary school. They may be in mainstream classes with the support of a
special education teacher and/or the care support of a special needs assistant
or may be in a special class.

A school may apply for a grant to make the school accessible for a student
with a disability, for example, to put in a ramp or accessible toilet
accommodation. Information about this provision can be obtained from the
Building Unit of the Department of Education – see 'How to apply' below.

The following support services are available for students with disabilities
and special educational needs attending post-primary schools:

  * Special education teacher 
  * [ Special needs assistants ](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/govieassets/13324/62fdf3b19c674eab80fd98468a00290a.pdf)
  * [ Equipment grants ](/en/education/primary-and-post-primary-education/educational-supports/assistive-technology-grant-students-with-disabilities/)

####  Special education teachers

Special education teachers provide extra teaching assistance.

Schools are provided with the [ necessary resources in advance
](https://assets.gov.ie/86912/18cab177-e903-44da-8648-fdfe1cf59f02.pdf) so
that students with special educational needs can be enrolled into schools and
access additional supports. You can find further information in the Department
of Education’s [ Circular 0013/2017 ](https://s3-eu-
west-1.amazonaws.com/govieassets/12768/ca1cbebc2e764367a9611b23b5886073.pdf)
and [ Circular 0003/2024 ](https://www.gov.ie/en/circular/3a5f0-special-
education-teacher-set-allocation-model-and-the-calculation-of-the-set-
allocation-for-each-school-from-the-202425-school-year/) . This enables a
school to be inclusive and put in place additional teaching support for
students who need it.

The Department of Education provides [ information for parents and guardians
on how your child can get additional teaching support in school (pdf)
](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/govieassets/123794/92dd3bfe-
cc8d-4238-80f5-2592cee9d137.pdf) .

If you have concerns with the level of support being given to your child you
should discuss this first with your child’s class teacher or special education
teacher. You could also discuss these issues with the school principal and if
necessary at a later point if you continue to have concerns with the
Chairperson of your Board of Management.

The allocation of special education teachers are being provided on the basis
that no child will be refused enrolment on the grounds that school does not
have sufficient teaching resources to meet that child’s needs. If your child
is refused enrolment to a school you may [ appeal this decision to a Section
29 Appeal Committee ](https://www.gov.ie/en/service/90de23-appeal-against-
permanent-exclusion-suspension-or-refusal-to-enrol/) .

####  Special needs assistants

Special needs assistants (SNAs) are allocated to schools to work with students
who have specific care needs. They provide non-teaching care support. SNAs
support students who have care needs resulting from a disability, behavioural
difficulties or a significant medical issue.

You can find further information on arrangements for the [ allocation of SNAs
in 2023-2024 ](https://www.gov.ie/en/circular/6180a-special-needs-assistant-
allocation-202324/) .

##  Special schools

There are special schools throughout the country for students with more
complex needs. These schools provide education for students from 4 to 18 years
who have complex special education needs where a mainstream school would not
be in the student's best interests. Some special schools may provide for
students in their area with a broader range of needs.

In addition, there are post-primary schools for visually impaired and hearing
impaired students in Dublin. These schools cater for both day students and
boarders. There are a small number of schools for students with physical
disabilities and a small number of special schools for students who have
behavioural and emotional difficulties.

Students usually take the [ Junior Cycle and Leaving Certificate examinations
](/en/education/state-examinations/) .

The schools make provision for students whose level of disability would make
it very difficult for them to benefit from the Junior Cycle and Leaving
Certificate programmes. In some schools for students with mild learning
disabilities, students may be offered the opportunity to take part in the
Junior Cycle curriculum.

##  State examinations

Students with specific disabilities may be exempt from part of the examination
in a particular subject. In such cases, the certificates awarded may note that
the student has not sat an element of the examination. The annotation is made
where a core area of a subject is not assessed, or where the mode of
assessment used has the same effect. For example, hearing impaired students
may be exempt from the aural component of the examination. The certificate
would note that all elements of the subject were examined except the aural
element. Similarly, students with dyslexia may have spelling and grammar
waivers in language subjects and their certificates would note this.

The Equality Tribunal ruled in 2006 that this annotation was contrary to the
Equality Acts. On appeal, the Circuit Court found that the system of exemption
and related notation is a reasonable accommodation in the context of the Equal
Status legislation, and in June 2010 the High Court confirmed this finding.
This decision has since been appealed to the Supreme Court.

There are [ arrangements in place for reasonable accommodation for students
with disabilities sitting examinations ](/en/education/state-
examinations/examination-arrangements-for-students-with-disabilities/) .

##  Assessment of education needs

The [ Disability Act 2005
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2005/act/14/enacted/en/html) provides for
an Assessment of Need to identify your child's health needs and what health
services are needed to meet these needs. It is an assessment carried out by
the HSE for children or young people with a disability.

The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) must nominate a person to
carry out an assessment of education needs on behalf of the HSE when an
Assessment of Need is in process. Find out more about the [ Assessment of Need
for children or young people with a disability.
](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/cf321-national-nursing-pilot-for-children-
with-complex-healthcare-needs-pilot-scheme/)

##  Irish Sign Language (ISL) scheme

The [ Irish Sign Language (ISL) scheme
](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/3283c-irish-sign-language-isl-scheme/) is
for children who are Deaf and are attending primary school, post-primary
school or special school and whose main means of communication is using Irish
Sign Language. Children must be attending a recognised school.

The National Council for Special Education Needs (NCSE) manages the scheme
which provides:

  * An ISL Specialist Classroom Support (ISL-SCS) for individual students to help access teaching and learning. 
  * An ISL Advisor who can provide training and support for schools and staff to communicate using ISL 

The [ first phase supports children attending mainstream school
](https://www.gov.ie/en/press-release/4de54-ministers-foley-and-madigan-
announce-implementation-of-the-first-phase-of-isl-scheme/) . You apply through
your child’s school for the ISL Scheme. The school applies to the NCSE.

Find out more about [ how to qualify for the ISL Scheme
](https://www.gov.ie/en/press-release/4de54-ministers-foley-and-madigan-
announce-implementation-of-the-first-phase-of-isl-scheme/) .

##  Nursing supports to attend school

The HSE and NCSE are running a new [ pilot scheme to put nursing supports in
place for children with complex healthcare needs to attend school
](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/cf321-national-nursing-pilot-for-children-
with-complex-healthcare-needs-pilot-scheme/) . You can find out more about [
applying for the pilot scheme ](https://ncse.ie/national-nursing-programme-
pilot-for-children-with-complex-healthcare-needs) .

##  Home Tuition Scheme

The [ Home Tuition Scheme ](https://www.gov.ie/en/service/d15f58-home-
tuition/) provides funding to parents to provide education at home for
children who (for a number of reasons, such as chronic illness) are unable to
attend school. The scheme is also available to children with special
educational needs who are awaiting a suitable educational placement

##  Pilot project for young school leavers with disabilities

Since 2022, the NCSE is overseeing a [ 2-year pilot project to help students
aged 16 with intellectual disabilities and complex educational needs
](https://www.gov.ie/en/press-release/58fb9-ministers-foley-and-madigan-
announce-pilot-project-to-support-young-school-leavers-with-disabilities/) to
plan for their future options when leaving school. The pilot runs in selected
schools in Dublin and Galway.

##  Further education and training

The National Council for Special Education has published a [ guide to post
school education and training (pdf) ](http://ncse.ie/wp-
content/uploads/2014/10/NCSE-Post-School-Education-Training.pdf) which
provides information on the options available to school leavers with
disabilities.

##  How to apply for special educational supports

If your child has special educational needs you should talk to the school
principal about what learning supports are available in the school. If you
need advice about a post-primary school which could meet your child's needs
you should contact your [ local Special Educational Needs Organiser
](https://ncse.ie/special-educational-needs-organiser-seno) \- see 'Where to
apply' below.

Schools should contact the Building Unit of the Department of Education and
Skills for information about making schools accessible. Call the main
Department telephone number for assistance - see 'Where to apply'.

Schools should contact the National Council for Special Education (NSCE) which
administers and processes applications for special educational resources using
its network of Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs) - see 'Where to
apply'.
