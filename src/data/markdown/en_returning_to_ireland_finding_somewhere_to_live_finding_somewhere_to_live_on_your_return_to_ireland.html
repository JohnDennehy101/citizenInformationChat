##  Introduction

You will need somewhere to live when you move home to Ireland. You may be able
to stay with friends or family initially, or you may be in a position to rent
or buy a home immediately.

Irish citizens have an automatic right to live in Ireland. However, if you are
[ returning with a partner who is not a national of the EEA, UK or Switzerland
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/returning_to_ireland/residency_and_citizenship/)
, they will need permission from Immigration Service Delivery (ISD) to live
with you in Ireland.

This page has information on how to find accommodation when you return to
Ireland, including how to buy or rent a home and how to access housing
supports if you need them.

##  Renting when I return to Ireland

You may want to begin your search for rental accommodation before you return
to Ireland. You can do this by checking accommodation websites such as
daft.ie, myhome.ie, and rent.ie. You can search these websites using filters
such as price, location, and property size to find the accommodation you need.
Accommodation or letting agencies can also help you find private rented
accommodation, but they may charge a fee for this service.

You can also check the accommodation sections of newspapers, advertisements in
shops, and college notice boards. You may also find available accommodation
through word of mouth or 'To Let' signs on properties.

Before renting a property, you should view the accommodation in person and
meet your potential landlord, if possible. You may need to bring certain
documentation from the country you’re leaving, such as references from your
current landlord. Read about [ what to do when looking for a flat or house to
rent ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/housing/renting-a-home/looking-
for-a-flat-or-house-to-rent/) and how to avoid [ rental scams
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/housing/renting-a-home/looking-for-a-
flat-or-house-to-rent/#028340) .

As a tenant, you should know your [ rights and responsibilities
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/housing/renting-a-home/tenants-rights-
and-responsibilities/tenants-rights-and-obligations/) as well as your [
landlord’s obligations
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/housing/renting-a-home/landlords-
rights-and-responsibilities/landlords-rights-and-obligations/) . [ Threshold
](https://www.threshold.ie/) is also a useful source of information and advice
on landlord and tenant issues.

###  **Help for older people living abroad**

If you are an older, Irish-born emigrant living abroad, and you want to return
to Ireland, [ Safe Home Ireland ](https://safehomeireland.com/) may be able to
help you find accommodation.

To qualify for housing support from Safe Home Ireland you must:

  * Be aged 57 or over 
  * Be capable of independent living 
  * Be living in rented accommodation abroad and unable to pay for accommodation when you return to Ireland 

If you are eligible, they will work to secure accommodation for you before you
return. Check if you can get [ housing assistance from Safe Home Ireland
](https://safehomeireland.com/housing-assistance/) .

##  Can I get help to pay my rent?

If you return home to Ireland and have difficulty paying rent, you can apply
for housing support from the State.

If you have a long-term housing need when you return, you can [ apply to your
local authority for social housing support
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/housing/local-authority-and-social-
housing/applying-for-local-authority-housing/) . You may have to [ show a
local connection ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/returning-to-
ireland/finding-somewhere-to-live/guide-to-housing-supports-for-returning-
irish-emigrants/#f96325) to the area were you are applying for housing. In
some circumstances, this requirement can be waived.

If you qualify, you will be added to the social housing list. You may have to
wait a long time to be allocated social housing. While you are on the waiting
list, you can apply for the [ Housing Assistance Payment (HAP)
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/housing/renting-a-home/help-with-
renting/housing-assistance-payment/) to help with the cost of renting
privately.

####  **What if I'm homeless when I return?**

If you will be homeless when you return to Ireland, you can get emergency
accommodation from the local authority in the area where you have a local
connection. As part of this, you will need to complete an application for
social housing. You can read more on the [ housing supports available for
homeless people ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/housing/losing-your-
home-and-homelessness/supports-for-homeless-people/) .

##  Buying a home when I return to Ireland

Before you look into buying a home, review your finances and decide what you
can afford to spend. Make sure you can cover all the [ costs involved in
buying a home ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/housing/owning-a-
home/buying-a-home/costs-of-buying-a-home/) , including legal fees, insurance,
[ stamp duty ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/housing/owning-a-
home/buying-a-home/stamp-duty/) , deposit, and monthly mortgage repayments.

If you apply for a mortgage, you will be asked for bank account statements and
proof of income. Lenders will also look at your credit history. This may
include your credit history both in Ireland and abroad. When returning to
Ireland, make sure to bring all relevant financial documentation with you.

You should get [ approval in principle
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/housing/owning-a-home/help-with-
buying-a-home/taking-out-a-mortgage/#b4a738) before you begin looking at
properties. The amount of money you can get as a mortgage loan, and the amount
you need as a deposit are governed by Central Bank lending limits—see [ Taking
out a mortgage ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/housing/owning-a-
home/help-with-buying-a-home/taking-out-a-mortgage/) for details of these
rules.

You can begin your search for properties online using accommodation websites
like daft.ie and myhome.ie. You can also contact estate agents in the area you
would like to live to ask about available properties. You can read about the [
steps involved in buying a home
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/housing/owning-a-home/buying-a-
home/steps-involved-buying-a-home/) .

####  **Can I buy a home before I return to Ireland?**

You do not have to be resident in Ireland to buy a property. However, if you
want to apply for a mortgage in Ireland, you must meet certain criteria. Read
about the [ steps involved in buying a home
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/housing/owning-a-home/buying-a-
home/steps-involved-buying-a-home/) .

####  **Can I apply for an affordable housing scheme when I return?**

If you have not previously purchased a property in Ireland or abroad, you may
qualify for the [ First Home Scheme (FHS)
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/housing/owning-a-home/help-with-
buying-a-home/first-home-scheme/) . The FHS is a shared equity scheme. This
means that the State and participating banks pay up to 30% of the cost of your
new home in return for a stake in the home. Read more about [ the First Home
Scheme and answers to frequently asked questions
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/housing/owning-a-home/help-with-
buying-a-home/first-home-scheme/) .

There is a similar [ Local Authority Affordable Purchase Scheme
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/housing/owning-a-home/help-with-
buying-a-home/local-authority-affordable-purchase-scheme/) where the local
authority buys a stake in your home. However, this scheme only applies in
certain areas.

You may qualify for the [ Help to Buy Scheme
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/housing/owning-a-home/help-with-
buying-a-home/help-to-buy-scheme/) . This scheme gives a refund of the [
income tax ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/money_and_tax/tax/) and [
Deposit Interest Retention Tax (DIRT)
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/money-and-tax/tax/tax-on-savings-and-
investments/deposit-interest-retention-tax/) you have paid in Ireland in the
previous 4 tax years. However, you must have paid a certain amount of tax in
Ireland in the last 4 years to be eligible.

##  Can I get nursing home care when Ireturn to Ireland?

If you or a family member needs nursing home care when you return, you should
find a nursing home that meets your needs. You can find a [ list of registered
nursing homes on the HIQA website ](https://www.hiqa.ie/areas-we-work/find-a-
centre/map) . The HSE also has a [ guide to choosing a nursing home (pdf)
](https://www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/4/olderpeople/residentialcare/nursinghomechecklist.pdf)
.

If you need help paying for nursing home care, you can apply to the Nursing
Home Support Scheme, also known as the [ Fair Deal Scheme
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/health/health-services/health-
services-for-older-people/fair-deal-scheme/) . You must be ordinarily resident
in Ireland to qualify for the Fair Deal Scheme.

Under the Fair Deal Scheme, you pay a certain amount towards the cost of your
care and the HSE pays the rest. Fair Deal covers approved [ private nursing
homes, voluntary nursing homes(pdf)
](https://assets.hse.ie/media/documents/HSE_Section_40_List_200_Published.pdf)
and [ public nursing homes(pdf)
](https://assets.hse.ie/media/documents/Cost_of_Care_in_Public_Nursing_Homes_2024.pdf)
.

If you choose to pay for nursing home care privately, you must pay the full
cost of the private nursing home directly.
