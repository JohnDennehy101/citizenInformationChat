#  Basic bank accounts

  * Introduction 
  * Services and charges 
  * How can I get a basic bank account? 
  * Further information 

##  Introduction

If you do not have a current account, you can open a type of account called a
basic bank account. A basic bank account is a current account that is free of
charge for everyday banking for at least the first year.

You can open a basic bank account with one of the main Irish banks if you are
resident in the EU and you do not already have another payment or current
account in Ireland.

##  Services and charges

When you open a basic bank account there are no charges for everyday banking
or maintenance fees for the first year.

After a year, the bank will review your account. You can continue to get free
banking for up to 5 years in total if the amount paid into your account each
year is less than the minimum wage.

Services that are free include:

Card services

  * Taking out money at an ATM (cash machine) 
  * Using a debit card in a shop to pay for something and for getting cash-back in a shop 
  * Using a debit card to pay for something online 

Transfers

  * Transferring money to another bank account 
  * Transferring money to pay a bill and other payments (like your electricity or heating or topping up your mobile) 
  * Putting money into the account (making a lodgement) 

Managing your account

  * Setting up and changing a standing order (this is where you have a regular amount coming out of your account and going into a savings account or to pay bills) 
  * Setting up a direct debit to automatically make regular payments where the amount can change, for example, for bills 
  * Getting a regular statement that tells you what is in your account, what you have taken out and your transaction history 
  * Using phone banking and online banking (there are no bank charges but there may be phone call or data charges) 

Ask the bank for a list of charges that do apply. These may include, for
example, charges for replacing a lost card or for using a card abroad.

###  What restrictions are in place?

Not all current account services are available with a basic account. You
cannot get an overdraft or cheque book. Your debit card may not come with the
contactless payment feature.

You can only hold one account.

##  How can I get a basic bank account?

To get a basic bank account, you must:

  * Be at least 16 years of age (or at least 18 for PTSB) 
  * Be legally resident in the EU 
  * Not have another current account with a bank in Ireland 

To open an account contact the bank of your choice. The following basic bank
accounts are available:

**Bank** |  **Account name**  
---|---  
AIB  |  Basic Bank Account   
PTSB  |  Basic Payment Account   
Bank of Ireland  |  Basic Bank Account   
  
The EBS Money Manager account is similar to a basic bank account but you can
open it if you have another bank account. It does not have fees for everyday
banking and does not provide overdrafts or chequebooks.
