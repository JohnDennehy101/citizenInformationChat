#  Working Holiday Visas in Ireland

  * What is a working holiday visa? 
  * Requirements by country 
  * Where to apply 

##  What is a working holiday visa?

Ireland has working holiday agreements with a number of different countries.
These allow young people from certain countries to travel to Ireland for
longer than a tourist visa, and to work while you are here to support your
travel expenses.

The main purpose of your trip should be to holiday and the work or studying
should be supplemental. If you are traveling primarily to work or to study you
should look into other visas.

##  Requirements by country

The application process, requirements and permissions granted vary depending
on what country you are from. Generally, you must provide:

  * Your current passport 
  * Two recent passport photographs 
  * Proof that you have sufficient funds to sustain yourself until you can find employment and that you have either already purchased a ticket home or have the funds to do so 
  * Proof that you have private health insurance 
  * Your Curriculum Vitae (CV) 
  * Copies of educational certificates, or, if you are still a student, a letter from your college 

You must get the working holiday visa before you come to Ireland. The visa
does not guarantee that you can enter Ireland.

No matter where you are coming from you will have to register for an [ Irish
Residence Permit ](https://www.irishimmigration.ie/registering-your-
immigration-permission/information-on-registering/irish-residence-permit/) as
soon as possible after you arrive in Ireland if you intend to stay more than
