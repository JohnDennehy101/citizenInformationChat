##  Introduction

If you bought something from a business, to be delivered, the seller must
deliver the goods within 30 days. This applies unless:

  * You agree a different arrangement with the seller 
  * The seller is based outside the EU 

If you agree a specific date for delivery of the goods as part of the contract
and you do not get the goods on or before that date, you can cancel and get a
refund.

Because your contract is with the seller (and not the courier or delivery
service) it is the seller’s responsibility to make sure the item is delivered
to you.

This page explains your rights and some of the most common consumer problems
with late or non-delivery, items damaged or lost and additional costs.

##  Delivery costs and restrictions

By law, you must be told about delivery costs and any restrictions that apply
before you buy.

###  Delivery costs

The seller must give you information about the total cost of the order in a
clear and understandable way. This must include information about extra
unavoidable costs such as delivery or postal charges and arrangements for
delivery.

For products bought _at a distance_ (that is online, by phone or away from the
business premises), you must get this information by the time you get to the
payment stage, at the very latest. A seller cannot charge you extra without
your explicit agreement.

These requirements are set out under the [ Consumer Rights Act 2022 (pdf)
](https://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2022/act/37/enacted/en/pdf) . Read more
about [ your consumer rights ](/en/consumer/consumer-laws/your-consumer-
rights/) .

Pay attention to any other charges. For example, if you buy from a trader
based outside the EU, you may have to pay for Value Added Tax (VAT) and
customs. This may be collected on your doorstep by the company delivering the
product to you.

###  Delivery restrictions

The seller must also tell you about any delivery restrictions that apply.

There may be restrictions on the locations that the seller delivers to. A
trader does not have to deliver to Ireland.

However, a seller cannot deny you access to their goods and services based on
your nationality or place of residence under the Geo-blocking Regulation. This
means that you have a right to order the goods and collect them at the
trader’s premises, or have them delivered to an address or pick up point,
where the trader offers these options to local customers.

You can find examples from the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission
(CCPC) on [ how the Geo-blocking Regulations apply (pdf)
](https://www.ccpc.ie/business/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/12/Geo-
blocking-Guide.pdf) .

##  My goods are delayed

Your purchase must be delivered without undue delay and not later than 30 days
from the date the order was placed (unless you agreed to a different date).
This only applies to products bought from traders based within the EU.

If the seller does not deliver the goods within the time agreed, you can ask
for the goods to be delivered at a later, more convenient date. If the seller
fails to deliver within this additional period, you can cancel the contract
and get a refund of all the money you paid.

If you told the seller that delivery by a certain date was essential and the
seller agreed to this, you can cancel the contract and get a refund if they
fail to deliver within the agreed time. You can also cancel the contract and
get a refund if the seller tells you that they cannot or will not deliver the
goods.

##  My goods are lost or arrived damaged

The seller is responsible for damage or loss of your goods from the time they
are dispatched until you receive them. This is the case where the seller has
offered a particular post, delivery or courier service and this was not
organised by you.

If you organised your own delivery service or nominated someone else to
receive the goods (for example, a neighbour), then the seller’s responsibility
for the goods ends once the person you nominated receives them.

If you are using a home delivery or proxy address service (for example An
Post’s AddressPal) then you have a separate contract for that service. The
seller’s liability ends once the goods are passed to this third party. In this
case, the third party has responsibility for your goods but there may be terms
and conditions in your contract that limit their liability for loss or damage.

##  Getting your refund

If the seller fails to deliver your goods within 30 days or the specified
date, you can cancel the contract and get a refund of all the money you paid
(including delivery) without delay.

For goods bought at a _distance_ (that is online, by phone or away from the
business premises), you have the right to cancel your order within the
cooling-off period (14 days from delivery) without having to give a reason.
However, you may have to pay for the cost of returning the goods. Always check
the returns policy before buying.

Where you use your right to cancel, you must be refunded for the full amount
you paid, including the standard delivery costs to send the item to you. You
are only entitled to a refund for standard delivery. If you chose to pay more
for next day, express or nominated day delivery, the seller only has to refund
you for standard delivery.

The trader must give you your refund within 14 days. The refund must be in the
same form as the original payment unless you agree some other method. For
example, if you originally paid in cash, you can insist on any refund also
being in cash.

##  If I need more help

If you have a problem with delivery of something you have ordered, you should
first contact the seller, in writing if possible.

The European Consumer Centre (ECC) Ireland have a [ letter template
](https://www.eccireland.ie/letter/non-delivery/) which may be helpful.

If you cannot resolve the issue with the seller directly, you can:

  * Contact the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC) for information and advice 
  * Contact your bank or credit card provider to use chargeback. The CCPC has more information on [ chargeback ](https://www.ccpc.ie/consumers/money/credit-cards/disputed-card-transactions-chargeback/)
  * Take a claim against the seller using the [ Small Claims Procedure ](/en/justice/courts-system/small-claims-court/)
