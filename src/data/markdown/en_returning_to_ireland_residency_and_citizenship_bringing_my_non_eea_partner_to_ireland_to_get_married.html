##  Introduction

You do not need to be resident in Ireland to get married here. However, you
may need a visa to come to Ireland if you are not a citizen of the UK,
Switzerland, or a country in the European Economic Area (the EU plus Norway,
Iceland, and Lichtenstein).

If you are an EEA, Swiss, or UK citizen, you can come to Ireland to get
married without a visa or immigration permission.

This page is a guide for non-EEA, Swiss, or UK citizens coming to Ireland to
marry their Irish citizen partner.

##  Check if you need a visa

You can [ check if you need a visa on our website
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/moving-country/visas-for-ireland/visa-
requirements-for-entering-ireland#l71449) .

If you need a visa, you should apply for a [ marriage (C) short-stay visa
](https://www.visas.inis.gov.ie/avats/OnlineHome.aspx) to come to Ireland to
get married. See ‘How to apply for a marriage visa’ below.

If you are not a citizen of the EEA, UK, or Switzerland and you don’t need a
visa, you still need to bring documents with you to show the reason for your
visit. You must present yourself to border control at point of entry when you
enter Ireland. This is usually at the airport.

##  When to apply for a marriage visa

Before you can apply for a marriage visa, you must notify the registrar at a [
civil registration service ](https://www2.hse.ie/services/births-deaths-and-
marriages/contact-a-civil-registration-service.html) in Ireland that you are
getting married. This must be done at least 3 months before the marriage and
is known as giving [ notice of your intention to marry ](/en/birth-family-
relationships/getting-married/notification-requirements-for-marriage/) .

After you get an acknowledgement from the registrar, you can apply for a
marriage visa. You can apply for a marriage visa up to 3 months before your
date of travel to Ireland.

###  If you live abroad

If you live outside of Ireland, you should contact a registrar to get
permission to make your 3-month notification by post. If permission is
granted, the registrar will send you a form which you must complete and
return.

You will still have to meet the registrar in person at least 5 days before you
get married to sign the declaration form. The registrar will then give you a
Marriage Registration Form.

###  Interview with the registrar

If either you or your partner are not an EU citizen, you will both need to
attend an interview with the registrar. The registrar has the right to
investigate and decide whether an intended marriage would be a ‘marriage of
convenience’ for immigration purposes.

##  How to apply for a marriage visa

You must apply for a [ marriage (C) short-stay visa online
](https://www.visas.inis.gov.ie/avats/OnlineHome.aspx) .

After you complete the visa form online, you have 30 days to send the
supporting documents. It’s a good idea to prepare your documents before
completing the form.

You pay a fee of €60 for each application.

####  Summary sheet

When you have submitted the form online, you will get a summary of your
application. This includes:

  * Your visa application transaction number 
  * Your application summary sheet 
  * Details of the application office where you should send your documents 

Print the application summary sheet and sign it. Send the application summary
and supporting documents to the address stated on the form.

##  Documents you need to apply for amarriage visa

You must send documents in support of your visa application.

These include:

  * Evidence of your relationship history. 
  * Confirmation from the Registrar of date of receipt of notification of intention to marry **or** a Marriage Registration Form 
  * Your current passport and a full copy of all previous passports 
  * Two passport photos no less than 6 months old (with your signature and application number on the back) 
  * A signed letter of application 
  * Details of where you will stay in Ireland 
  * Bank statement 
  * Previous visa refusals 

You can get a [ full list of required documents
](https://www.irishimmigration.ie/coming-to-visit-ireland/how-to-apply-for-a-
short-stay-c-visit-tourist-visa/marriage-visa/#supporting) on the Immigration
Service Delivery website.

You must send original documents (not photocopies). If your documents are not
in English, you must send a [ certified translation
](https://www.irishimmigration.ie/how-to-make-a-certified-translation-of-a-
document/) and the original document.

Birth, marriage, and death certificates will be returned to you. If you want
other pages returned to you, you should include a note with your application
that says this. Send a photocopy (in addition to the original) of the page you
want returned to you.

If your visa is approved, you must get travel or medical insurance before you
travel to Ireland.

##  Decisions and appeals

If you sent your application to Dublin, you can [ check visa decisions and
waiting times ](https://www.irishimmigration.ie/visa-decisions/) . If you sent
your application somewhere else, you can contact the embassy or consulate you
sent your documents to for updates on your application. Applications generally
take around 8 weeks to receive a decision, but may take longer.

If your visa application is successful, the visa office will post your
passport back to you with the visa attached. The visa will be valid for a
particular period. Having a visa does not guarantee that you will be [ allowed
to enter Ireland ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/moving-country/visas-
for-ireland/permission-to-land-in-ireland/) .

###  Refusals

You will get a letter that says why your visa application was refused. You can
appeal this decision within 2 months.

##  Can I stay in Ireland after I ammarried on a marriage visa?

If you arrive in Ireland on a short-stay marriage (C) visa, you cannot stay
for longer than 3 months. You must leave Ireland and apply for another visa if
you want to return.

If you plan to return to Ireland to live with your Irish citizen spouse, you
can [ apply for a Join Family Member (D) visa online
](https://www.visas.inis.gov.ie/avats/OnlineHome.aspx) . When you arrive in
Ireland on your Join Family Member (D) visa, you can then register with
immigration as the spouse of an Irish citizen.

###  If you do not need a visa

If you are a non-visa required national who has entered Ireland legally within
the last 90 days, you can register with immigration as the spouse of an Irish
citizen.
