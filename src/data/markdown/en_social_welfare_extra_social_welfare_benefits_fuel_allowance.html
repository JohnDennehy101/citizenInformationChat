##  What is Fuel Allowance?

Fuel Allowance is a payment to help with the cost of heating your home during
the winter months. It is paid to only one person in a household.

The Fuel Allowance season normally begins in late September of each year and
ends in April. The 2024/2025 Fuel Allowance season starts on Monday, 23
September 2024. It will be paid for 28 weeks (until 4 April 2025).

The current rate of Fuel Allowance is €33 per week. You can choose to get the
Fuel Allowance paid every week or paid in 2 instalments (lump sums).

In the 2023/2024 Fuel Allowance season, the first lump sum instalment was paid
in September 2023. The second was paid in January 2024.

##  How to qualify for Fuel Allowance

To get Fuel Allowance you must:

  * Live alone (or only with certain people listed below) 
  * Be getting a qualifying payment (unless you are 70 or over) 
  * Satisfy a means test 

These 3 conditions are explained in detail below.

You must also live in Ireland. You cannot get Fuel Allowance if your heating
costs are provided in full as part of your accommodation.

##  Who can I live with?

To get Fuel Allowance, you must live alone, or with:

  * A spouse, civil partner or cohabitant who qualifies for an increase on your pension or social welfare payment, or is getting a qualifying payment in their own right 
  * Dependent children 
  * A person who gets Carer's Allowance or Carer's Benefit, and who is caring for you **or** for your spouse, partner or cohabitant, or for a [ qualified child dependant ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/claiming-a-social-welfare-payment/claiming-and-increase-in-your-payment-for-a-child-dependant/) on a full-time basis 
  * A person getting short-term Jobseeker's Allowance (less than 312 days) or basic Supplementary Welfare Allowance (less than 364 days) 
  * A person getting a qualifying payment (for example, long-term Jobseeker’s Allowance) and who would be eligible for a Fuel Allowance in their own right 
  * A person aged 70 or over 
  * A person [ renting a room ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/housing/owning-a-home/home-owners/renting-out-a-room-in-your-home/) from you, where this doesn’t affect your entitlement to Fuel Allowance 
  * A person you provide accommodation to in your own home, and for whom you get the [ Accommodation Recognition Payment ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/moving-country/ukrainian-refugees-in-ireland/accommodation-recognition-payment/)

See ‘Renting a room in your home’ below for more information.

###  If more than one person in a household qualifies

Only one Fuel Allowance payment is paid to a household.

If more than one person in the household is **getting a social assistance
payment** , you can decide who applies for Fuel Allowance.

If someone in the household is **getting a qualifying social insurance
payment** , such as State Pension (Contributory) or Invalidity Pension, they
should apply first (so a means test can be carried out on their income).
Another qualifying person in the household can also apply for Fuel Allowance,
but they must include information about the person getting a social insurance
payment.

If someone in the household is **70 or over** , they should apply.

##  Qualifying social welfare payments and pensions

If you are 70 or over, you don’t need a qualifying payment to qualify for Fuel
Allowance.

Social welfare payments are either based on your PRSI contributions (social
insurance payments) or means-tested social assistance payments.

###  Qualifying social insurance payments

  * [ State Pension (Contributory) ](/en/social-welfare/older-and-retired-people/state-pension-contributory/)
  * [ Widow's, Widower's or Surviving Civil Partner's (Contributory) Pension ](/en/social-welfare/death-related-benefits/widowed-persons-contrib-pension/)
  * Incapacity Supplement under the [ Occupational Injuries Benefit scheme ](/en/social-welfare/disability-and-illness/occupational-injuries-benefit-overview/)
  * [ Invalidity Pension ](/en/social-welfare/disability-and-illness/invalidity-pension/)
  * [ Guardian's Payment (Contributory) ](/en/social-welfare/death-related-benefits/guardian-and-orphan-payments/)
  * Death Benefit under the Occupational Injuries Scheme 
  * A pension or benefit from a country covered by EU Regulations or a country with which Ireland has a bilateral social security agreement (provided there is an equivalent Irish payment) 

###  Qualifying social assistance payments

  * [ State Pension (Non-Contributory) ](/en/social-welfare/older-and-retired-people/state-pension-non-contributory/)
  * [ Widow's, Widower's or Surviving Civil Partner's (Non-Contributory) Pension ](/en/social-welfare/death-related-benefits/widowed-persons-non-contrib-pension/)
  * [ Disability Allowance ](/en/social-welfare/disability-and-illness/disability-allowance/)
  * [ Blind Pension ](/en/social-welfare/disability-and-illness/blind-persons-pension/)
  * [ Deserted Wife's Benefit or Allowance ](/en/social-welfare/families-and-children/deserted-wife-s-payments/)
  * [ One-Parent Family Payment (OFP) ](/en/social-welfare/families-and-children/one-parent-family-payment/)
  * [ Guardian's Payment (Non-Contributory) ](/en/social-welfare/death-related-benefits/guardian-and-orphan-payments/)
  * [ Farm Assist ](/en/social-welfare/farming-and-fishing/farm-assist/)
  * [ Jobseeker's Transitional payment (JST) ](/en/social-welfare/unemployed-people/jobseekers-transitional-payment/)

####  Supplementary Welfare Allowance

You can qualify if you have been getting [ Basic Supplementary Welfare
Allowance ](/en/social-welfare/supplementary-welfare-schemes/supplementary-
welfare-allow/) for more than a year (this is 364 days over 12 months - it is
paid on a 7-day week basis so 12 months’ payment is reached after day 364).

####  Jobseeker’s Allowance

You qualify if you have been getting [ Jobseeker's Allowance ](/en/social-
welfare/unemployed-people/jobseekers-allowance/) for more than 312 days (over
12 months - it is paid on a 6-day week basis so 12 months’ payment is reached
after day 312). Days on Jobseeker's Benefit (JB) and PUP can count towards the
312 days, if your JB or PUP was immediately before your JA claim.

You can keep your Fuel Allowance if you move to Jobseeker’s Allowance from One
Parent Family Payment, Carer’s Allowance or Jobseeker’s Transitional payment.

####  Spouse, civil partner or cohabitant on a CE scheme

If you are getting Jobseeker’s Allowance, and your spouse, civil partner or
cohabitant is on a Community Employment (CE) scheme, they can be considered as
a qualified adult on your payment if you apply for Fuel Allowance.

####  Employment or education support schemes

You can keep your Fuel Allowance if you were getting it before you started any
of the following schemes:

  * Back to Work Allowance 
  * Back to Education Allowance 
  * Back to Work Enterprise Allowance (BTWEA) 
  * Community Employment (CE) 
  * Rural Social Scheme (RSS) 
  * Tús 

####  CE, RSS and Tús

You can apply for Fuel Allowance at any point when you are on CE, RSS or Tús
if you meet all the relevant qualifying conditions for Fuel Allowance. If you
were getting a long-term qualifying payment before starting CE, RSS or Tús,
you satisfy the qualifying payment requirement.

For the 2024/2025 Fuel Allowance season, time spent on CE, Tús and RSS can be
used to meet the minimum number of days on a qualifying payment for Fuel
Allowance.

####  Half-rate payments

You do not qualify for Fuel Allowance if you are getting a [ half-rate payment
](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/claiming-a-social-welfare-
payment/claiming-two-social-welfare-payments/) in addition to a qualifying
payment. This does not apply to [ half-rate Carer’s Allowance ](/en/social-
welfare/carers/half-rate-carers-allowance/) .

##  How your income is assessed for Fuel Allowance

Fuel Allowance is a means-tested payment. This means that the Department of
Social Protection (DSP) examines all your sources of income. Your gross weekly
income must be below a certain amount to pass the means test.

You are usually accepted as passing the means test for Fuel Allowance, if you
are getting a qualifying social assistance (means-tested) payment.

If you get a means-tested payment, you have already satisfied the means test
and it does not need to be done again.

###  Social welfare payments and other income

Income from some social welfare payments and certain other sources are not
counted in the means test:

  * All social assistance payments are not counted 
  * If you get a social insurance payment and your spouse or partner gets a social assistance payment, the income from the social assistance payment is not counted 
  * Half-rate Carer’s Allowance is no longer counted (from January 2023) 
  * Disablement Benefit is no longer counted (from January 2023) 
  * Any maintenance received in respect of a child is not counted (from June 2024) 
  * Compensation awards under the Mother and Baby Institutions Payment Scheme are not counted 
  * Compensation awards to people who have contracted Hepatitis C from contaminated blood products 

You can read the full list of [ payments that are disregarded
](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/e7fcaa-operational-guidelines-fuel-
allowance-scheme/#means-test) (not counted).

###  Capital

Capital includes the value of savings, investments, shares or any property you
have (but not your own home).

If you are under 70, the first €20,000 of your capital is not taken into
account.

If you are 70 or over, the first €50,000 of your capital is not taken into
account. Find out more about [ capital not included in the means test
](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/means-test-for-social-
welfare-payments/how-to-assess-your-means-from-capital-for-social-welfare-
payments/) .

Capital is assessed by assuming an amount of weekly income for the capital you
have above a certain figure.

####  Second property

If you have a second property (property other than your own home), the rental
income from that property is assessed. However, the capital value (less any
mortgage outstanding on the property) will be assessed if the property is not
rented.

###  Renting a room in your home

If you are [ renting out a room in your home ](https://www.gov.ie/en/press-
release/4bf45-minister-humphreys-announces-measures-to-remove-barriers-facing-
social-welfare-customers-seeking-to-take-in-tenants/) , you can have an income
from rent of up to €269.23 a week (€14,000 per year) without affecting your
Fuel Allowance. The person renting the room in your home must use the room for
a minimum of 28 consecutive days and cannot be an employee of yours or an
immediate family member.

The [ Accommodation Recognition Payment ](/en/moving-country/ukrainian-
refugees-in-ireland/accommodation-recognition-payment/) (for hosting people
from Ukraine) is not taken into account in the means test.

Since 1 February 2024, someone renting a room from you, or for whom you get
the Accommodation Recognition Payment, does **not** have to:

  * Get a qualifying social welfare payment, nor 
  * Qualify for Fuel Allowance in their own right. 

###  UK Winter Fuel Payment

Some UK pensioners living in Ireland may be getting a [ Winter Fuel Payment
](https://www.gov.uk/winter-fuel-payment) from the UK. If they are, the Winter
Fuel Payment is assessed in the means test for Fuel Allowance.

##  Fuel Allowance income limit for people over 70

You should read how your income is assessed (above) before reading this
section.

You can have income of up to €512 per week, or €1,024 per week for a couple
and still qualify for Fuel Allowance.

Your capital (savings, property and investments) are also assessed. The first
€50,000 of your capital is not included in the means test.

##  Fuel Allowance income limit for people under 70

If you are under 70, you must be getting a qualifying payment to apply for
Fuel Allowance (see ‘Qualifying social welfare payments and pensions above’).

To qualify for Fuel Allowance, your means must be less than the maximum [
State Pension (Contributory) ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-
welfare/social-welfare-payments/older-and-retired-people/state-pension-
contributory/) , including any increases you could get for dependents or
living alone, plus an additional €200. This is called the ‘assessable income
limit’.

For example, the maximum [ State Pension (Contributory)
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/social-welfare-
payments/older-and-retired-people/state-pension-contributory/) for a single
person aged 66 is €277.30. You then add €200 to €277.30, which gives a total
weekly income limit of €477.30.

See the table below for examples of weekly assessable income limits.

**Household type** |  **Assessable income limit (per week)**  
---|---  
Single person under 70  |  €477.30   
Couple (where qualified adult is under 66)  |  €662.00   
Couple (where qualified adult is 66 or over, but under 70)  |  €725.90   
  
###  Deferred State Pension (Contributory) means threshold

From January 2024, you can choose to start claiming your State Pension
(Contributory) anytime between the ages of 66 and 70. If you defer your
pension, you may be entitled to a higher rate of payment. If you are, the
income limit for Fuel Allowance is increased to your higher rate of State
Pension (Contributory) plus €200.

##  How much is Fuel Allowance?

The current weekly rate of Fuel Allowance is €33.

You can get your Fuel Allowance paid weekly or in 2 lump sum instalments.

###  Weekly payment

Fuel Allowance is usually paid from the end of September to April each year
for 28 weeks. In 2024/2025, the Fuel Allowance starts on Monday, 23 September
2024. Fuel Allowance is included in your weekly payment, if you are getting a
social welfare payment.

If you are not getting a social welfare payment, your Fuel Allowance can be
paid directly into your account in a financial institution or you can collect
it from your local post office.

###  Lump sum payments

In 2024/2025, the total Fuel Allowance payment over 28 weeks is €924.

It can be paid to you in 2 instalments (lump sums) - September 2024 and
January 2025.

To change how your Fuel Allowance is paid, fill in the [ Change the Payment
Frequency form (pdf)
](https://assets.gov.ie/26443/817ed1f255c04cd3b08a283db1a98831.pdf) at least
one month before the first instalment is due.

This instalment option is not available to people getting payments under the
Rural Social Scheme, Tús, Gateway, Community Employment or Supplementary
Welfare Allowance.

###  **Telephone Support Allowance**

If you are getting Fuel Allowance as well as the [ Living Alone Increase
](/en/social-welfare/extra-social-welfare-benefits/living-alone-allowance/) ,
you will also get a [ Telephone Support Allowance ](/en/social-welfare/extra-
social-welfare-benefits/telephone-support-allowance/) of €2.50 per week. This
is paid automatically with your main social welfare payment, so you do not
have to apply for it.

##  How to apply for Fuel Allowance

If you apply for Fuel Allowance after the start of the Fuel Allowance season,
it will not be backdated.

You do not need to reapply for Fuel Allowance each year as long as, your
circumstances remain the same and you continue to get the same social welfare
payment.
