  * Who can get a travel document? 
  * Travelling to Ireland with a ‘convention’ travel document 
  * How to apply for a travel document 
  * Further information 

##  Introduction

A travel document allows people living in Ireland who cannot get a passport to
travel outside Ireland. People who have been declared a refugee are entitled
to a 1951 Convention Travel Document.

You may also be able to get a travel document if you have subsidiary
protection status, and you cannot get a national passport from your country of
nationality.

You should note that travel documents take 26 weeks or more to process.

You may also need a visa to enter other countries. You should check always
with the embassy of the country where you to plan to travel before you go
there.

##  Who can get a travel document?

You may be eligible for a travel document if you:

  * Have been declared a refugee 
  * Have been granted Subsidiary Protection status 
  * Have been granted permission to live in Ireland following a request by the United National High Commissioner for Refugees (a _programme refugee_ ) 
  * You are the family member of any of the above 

###  Family members

You may get a travel document if you are a family member of someone with
refugee or subsidiary protection status. You must show that you have tried to
get a passport or travel document from your country of nationality.

Your children need their own travel documents.

###  Refugees

If you were declared a refugee following an application for international
protection, you can get a refugee travel document. It says “Convention of 28
July 1951” on the front cover. It is sometimes called a ‘1951 Convention
Travel Document’. You can travel to most countries in the EU without a visa,
and stay for up to 90 days using this travel document. You should check with
the embassy of the country where you plan to travel.

Programme refugees cannot get a 1951 Convention Travel Document. Instead, you
can apply for a regular travel document.

A travel document for refugee is valid for a maximum of 5 years.

###  People with subsidiary protection status

If you were granted subsidiary protection following an application for
international protection, ISD may give you a travel document if you cannot get
a passport from your country of nationality.

This travel document is valid for up to 5 years (or until your residency is
due for renewal).
