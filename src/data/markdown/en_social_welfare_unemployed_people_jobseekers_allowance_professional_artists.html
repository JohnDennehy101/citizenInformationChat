#  Professional artists on Jobseekers Allowance

  * Introduction 
  * Rules 
  * How to apply 

##  Introduction

The [ Social Welfare Scheme for Professional Artists on Jobseeker’s Allowance
(JA) ](https://www.gov.ie/en/service/b5474f-professional-artists-on-
jobseekers-allowance/) allows professional artists who are getting JA to focus
on their artistic work and to develop their portfolio for the first year that
they are out of work.

Under the Scheme, professional artists getting Jobseeker’s Allowance can be
exempt from [ labour market activation ](/en/social-welfare/unemployed-
people/employment-supports/) for the first year that they are out of work.

Art forms covered under the Scheme include visual arts, theatre, literature,
music, dance, opera, film and circus. The Department of Social Protection
provides a [ full list of professional art forms covered by the Scheme (pdf)
](https://www.gov.ie/pdf/?file=https://assets.gov.ie/27311/cbcb43e3c0144fa8bb145fe997f2324b.pdf#page=1)
.

##  Rules

To qualify for the Scheme, you must be aged over 18 and under 66. You must
also:

  * Be available for full-time work and genuinely seeking work

  * Be  registered as self-employed 

At least 50% of your income in the previous year should be derived from your [
work as a professional artist
](https://www.gov.ie/en/service/b5474f-professional-artists-on-jobseekers-
allowance/#how-to-qualify) . For example:

  * Lecture fees 
  * Sales of artistic editions 
  * Artist fee on commissioned works 
  * Artist fee on exhibitions

  * Artistic consultancy 
  * Artist fee for selection panels 
  * Artists fee for artistic advisory panels 
  * Artistic technical and installation support 
  * Art awards and prizes 
  * Artistic residencies 
  * Artist fee on design consultants 

When you are being assessed for the Scheme, you will be [ means tested as a
self-employed person ](/en/social-welfare/unemployed-people/self-employed-and-
unemployment/) and certain expenses related to your profession are allowable.  

##  How to apply

When you apply for [ Jobseeker’s Allowance ](/en/social-welfare/unemployed-
people/jobseekers-allowance/) , you should provide all the necessary
documentation including:

  * A certificate or declaration from a professional body that you are a professional artist

If you are already getting Jobseeker’s Allowance and you think you might
qualify for the Scheme, you should contact your local [ Intreo Centre or
Social Welfare Branch Office
](https://www.gov.ie/en/directory/category/e1f4b5-intreo-offices/) .
