##  What is the Back for Business programme?

Back for Business is a free development programme to help Irish citizens who
have returned to Ireland to start or develop a business. The programme is
funded through the [ Emigrant Support Programme ](https://www.dfa.ie/global-
irish/support-overseas/emigrant-support-programme/) by the Department of
Foreign Affairs.

Applications for the current programme are now closed.

If you are interested in participating in the next Back for Business
programme, you can [ register online
](https://www.backforbusiness.com/register-your-interest/) . You will be sent
a link to the application form as soon as they become available

###  How does the Back for Business programme work?

Back for Business is based on a model of peer support. This is where [
volunteer Lead Entrepreneurs ](https://www.backforbusiness.com/lead-
entrepreneurs/) share their experience of starting and growing a business in
Ireland with people who are in the early stages of starting a business.

The scheme runs for 6 months and involves interactive sessions (facilitated by
the Lead Entrepreneurs) that focus on achieving goals and milestones for your
business. The aim of the programme is to support you to address challenges in
starting, developing and positioning your business for sustainability and
growth. You must meet with your group and Lead Entrepreneur once per month
over the 6 months. There are also a range of other information sessions to
help you understand the system for entrepreneurs in Ireland.

If you are selected, you are expected to attend all events. Read about [
businesses that completed previous progammes
](https://www.backforbusiness.com/participant-profiles/) and current [ lead
entrepreneurs ](https://www.backforbusiness.com/lead-entrepreneurs/) on the
Back for Business website.

If you are not an Irish citizen, read about [ coming to set up a business or
invest in Ireland ](/en/moving-country/working-in-ireland/migrant-
workers/coming-to-set-up-a-business-in-ireland/) .

##  Who can apply for Back for Business?

Applications for the current programme are now closed. If you are interested
in participating in the next cycle of the Back for Business programme, you can
register [ **here** ](https://www.backforbusiness.com/register-your-interest/)
and you will be sent a link to the application form as soon as they become

call Back for Business on +353 1 8450770 or email [ info@backforbusiness.com

##  How to apply for Back for Business?

You can apply if you are an Irish emigrant who lived outside of Ireland for at
least one year and who has returned to Ireland in the last 3 years. You can
also apply if you are planning to return to Ireland in the near future.

Your business can be in any sector and you must expect to employ staff within
3 years. You must be a major shareholder and key decision maker in your
business.

One of the following must also apply to your business:

  * It is a new business in Ireland 
  * It is at an advanced stage of setting up and you expect to make sales in the next 12 months 
  * It is an existing business that you are acquiring (buying) 

If your business is new or acquired, it must not have made sales or been
acquired before 2020.

###  Who gets selected for Back for Business?

There are 50 spaces on the current Back for Business programme.

To be selected, you must meet the criteria above and show that you are
prepared to fully engage with the scheme over 6 months and determined to
develop your early stage business.

You do not need to do an interview or pitch to be selected. People who have
already returned to Ireland will be prioritised for selection.

The Lead Entrepreneurs will select the successful participants, and you will
be notified shortly afterwards.
