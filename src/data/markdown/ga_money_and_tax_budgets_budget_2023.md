Budget 2023 was announced on **Tuesday, 27 September 2022.** The Budget sets

The Budget is generally announced in October but it is taking place 2 weeks
earlier than usual in 2022.

This document is a short summary of the main changes in taxation, cost of
living supports, supports for energy costs, social welfare, health, housing,
education, employment and other areas. It is an overview and not a complete
statement of all the measures announced in Budget 2023.

Some of the changes announced in the Budget come into effect immediately or
before the end of 2022. Others take effect from the beginning of January 2023
or later in 2023. Many others have to be finalised before coming into effect.
Some elements of these measures may change when the legislation required to
bring them into effect is enacted.

##  Help with energy costs

€1.2 billion will be allocated for energy supports to help consumers with the
**costs of utilities** in 2022 and 2023.

All **domestic electricity customers** will get €600 credit to help reduce
electricity bills. The credit will be paid in 3 instalments of €200. The first
payment will be made in November 2022. The second electricity credit will be
made in January 2023. The third will be made in March 2023.

More people will qualify for **Fuel Allowance** . People getting Fuel
Allowance will get an additional once-off payment of €400 in November 2022,
see ‘Social welfare’ above.

The 9% VAT rate for gas and electricity is extended to 28 February 2023. The
reduction of 21 cent per litre tax for petrol, 16 cent per litre for diesel
and 5.4 cent per litre for Marked Gas Oil are also extended to 28 February
2023.

€340 million will be available to help community groups, schools, health
services, sports clubs and other organisations to pay energy bills.

New energy supports will also be available for businesses (see ‘Employment and
business’ below).

##  Tax

Income tax rates will stay the same (at 20% and 40%), but there will be
increases to tax credits and changes to the income tax bands in 2023.

The [ standard rate income tax band
](../tax/income_tax/how_your_tax_is_calculated.en.html#l2729c) (the amount you
can earn before you start to pay the higher rate of tax) will be increased by
€3,200.

The following [ tax credits ](/ga/money-and-tax/tax/income-tax-credits-and-
reliefs/introduction-to-income-tax-credits-and-reliefs/) will increase by €75
to €1,775:

  * Personal Tax Credit 
  * Employee Tax Credit 
  * Earned Income Tax Credit 

The Home Carer Tax Credit will increase by €100 to €1,700.

####  Universal Social Charge (USC)

The ceiling of the 2% [ USC ](/ga/money-and-tax/tax/income-tax/universal-
social-charge/) band will increase by €1,625 to €22,920, so that the salary of
a full-time worker on the minimum wage will remain outside the higher rates of
USC.

####  Rent Tax Credit

If you are paying for private rented accommodation, you can claim a new Rent
Tax Credit of €500 a year for 2022 and subsequent years. This tax credit
applies to each tenant rather than each tenancy. For rent you pay in 2022, you
will be able to claim this credit early in 2023.

####  Vacant Homes Tax

A Vacant Homes Tax will be introduced in 2023. It will apply to residential
properties that are occupied for less than 30 days a year. The tax charged
will be three times the amount of the Local Property Tax rate for the
property.

####  Carbon Tax

Carbon Tax will increase by €7.50 per tonne of carbon dioxide emitted, from
€41.00 to €48.50. This applies from 12 October 2022 for auto fuels but will be
offset by a levy reduction so that it will not result in a price increase. For
all other fuels, the Carbon Tax will increase from 1 May 2023. See
‘Environment and climate’ below, for examples of the price increases to common
household fuels.

####  VAT (Value Added Tax)

The VAT rate for newspapers (including digital editions) will be reduced from
9% to zero.

VAT will also be reduced to zero for:

  * Defibrillators 
  * Period products 
  * Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and nicotine replacement therapy medicines that are not currently zero-rated (such as patches and gels) 

These VAT changes will apply from 1 January 2023.

The reduced VAT rate of 9% for the hospitality and tourism sector will
continue until 28 February 2023.

####  Small Benefit Exemption

The Small Benefit Exemption will increase from €500 to €1,000. Employers can
give two vouchers or gifts to their employees each tax year. This increase
will also be applied for the 2022 tax year.

####  Tobacco Products Tax

A packet of 20 cigarettes will increase by €0.50 from 28 September 2022, with
pro-rata increases on other tobacco products.

##  Employment and business

A total of €940 million is allocated to the Department of Enterprise, Trade
and Employment in 2023.

###  Employees

**Income tax rates** will stay the same (at 20% and 40%), but there will be
increases to tax credits and changes to the income tax bands for 2023.

The **standard rate tax band** (the amount you can earn before you start to
pay the higher rate of tax) will be increased by €3,200 to €40,000 for a
single person and to €49,000 for married couples with one earner.

The following [ tax credits ](/ga/money-and-tax/tax/income-tax-credits-and-
reliefs/introduction-to-income-tax-credits-and-reliefs/) will increase by €75
to €1,775:

  * Personal Tax Credit 
  * Employee Tax Credit 
  * Earned Income Tax Credit 

The ceiling for the 2% [ Universal Social Charge (USC) ](/ga/money-and-
tax/tax/income-tax/universal-social-charge/) band will increase from €21,295
to €22,920 in line with the 80 cent per hour increase in the national minimum
wage from 1 January 2023. This ensures that full-time employees on the minimum
wage will remain outside the higher rates of USC.

The weekly income threshold for the higher rate of [ employer’s PRSI
](https://assets.gov.ie/235790/1f7aa00c-0978-46df-9576-4b51dd3826f7.pdf) will
increase from €410 to €441 to ensure that there is no incentive to reduce the
working hours for a full-time employee on the increased minimum wage from 1
January 2023.

The **Small Benefit Exemption** will increase from €500 to €1,000. Employers
can give 2 vouchers or gifts to employees each tax year. This increase will
also apply for the 2022 tax year.

###  Energy business supports

####  Temporary Business Energy Support Scheme (T-BESS)

Funding of €1.25 billion will be provided to help small and medium businesses
with energy costs under the **Temporary Business Energy Support Scheme
(T-BESS)** . The scheme will be administered by Revenue on a self-assessment
basis.

The main features of the scheme are:

  * Relief of up to 40% of the increased cost of gas and electricity bills up to a maximum of €10,000 per month per business. 
  * The average unit price for the relevant bill period in 2022 will be compared with the average unit price in the corresponding reference period in 2021. 
  * Business will be eligible for support if the increase in average unit price is more than 50%. 
  * Payments will be backdated to September 2022 and the scheme will run until at least February 2023. 

####  Ukraine Enterprise Crisis Scheme

A new scheme providing grants, equity and loans to viable but vulnerable
businesses in the manufacturing and internationally traded sector impacted by
the broader effects of the war in Ukraine and increasing energy costs.

A new state-backed, low-cost loan for businesses of up to €1 million over a
six-year term, with no collateral required for loans up to €250,000.

Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) including farmers and fishers to expand or

####  Small Firms Investment in Energy Efficiency Scheme

A new grant provided through Local Enterprise Offices to help micro-
enterprises to reduce their carbon footprint and energy costs.
