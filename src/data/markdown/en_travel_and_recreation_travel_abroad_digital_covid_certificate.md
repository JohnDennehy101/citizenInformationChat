EU Digital COVID Certificate (DCC)

#  EU Digital COVID Certificate (DCC)

  * Overview 

##  Overview

The EU Digital COVID Certificate (DCC) was used for travel originating within
the EU and EEA (the EU, plus Iceland, Norway, Lichtenstein, and Switzerland).
It was a standardised record of a medical event in an EU country.

Since 1 July 2023, you will no longer get an EU Digital Covid Certificate for
a negative test (PCR and antigen) or as proof of recovery (recovery
certificates).

If you need to discuss your vaccination record, you can contact [ HSE Live.
](https://www2.hse.ie/contact/)

Since 6 March 2022, all COVID-19 travel restrictions to Ireland have been
removed. You no longer need proof of vaccination or recovery, or a COVID-19
test.
