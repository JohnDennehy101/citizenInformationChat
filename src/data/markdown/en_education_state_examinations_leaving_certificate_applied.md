##  What is the Leaving Certificate Applied?

The Leaving Certificate Applied (LCA) is a 2-year Leaving Certificate
programme which prepares students for adult and working life.

The programme helps students apply what they learn to the real world.

The 2-year programme consists of 4 half-year blocks called sessions.
Achievements are credited in each session.

The [ established Leaving Certificate ](/en/education/state-
examinations/leaving-certificate/) is a different programme covering a wide
range of subjects taken over 2 years.

##  Leaving Certificate Applied courses

Courses are offered in 3 main areas:

  * Vocational preparation, involving work experience, enterprise and communication 
  * General education, offering life skills, the arts, social education, leisure and language 
  * Vocational education 

###  Course structure

Each course consists of a [ number of modules
](https://www.curriculumonline.ie/Senior-cycle/LCA/) . Each module takes place
over half a year. There is also a wide range of practical courses, called
vocational specialisms, from which the student can choose.

###  Assessment and examinations

Students are assessed continuously throughout the course and there is a final
examination.

Students are assessed on the completion of modules and practical activities
that allow you to integrate learning from different courses.

The final examination must be taken in:

  * English and communication 
  * Two vocational specialisms 
  * Mathematical applications 
  * Language 
  * Social education 

There are written and oral examinations in all languages. There are practical
examinations in the vocational specialisms. The written examinations usually
take place in June, at the same time as the examinations for the established
Leaving Certificate.

Since September 2022, students taking the LCA programme can choose to take the
established Leaving Certificate Mathematics and an established Leaving
Certificate Modern Language.
