#####

#####  When was CARI established?

The CARI Foundation was established in 1989.

#####  Why was CARI established?

CARI was established to address the needs of children, families and groups
affected by child sexual abuse, regardless of means and provide a child
centred specialised therapy and assist the recovery process.

#####  Who founded CARI?

CARI was founded by a group of medical, business and lay people concerned
about the absence of services for children who were beginning to disclose
their experiences of child sexual abuse. The very first services for women had
just been set up and Ireland was only beginning to acknowledge the level of
sexual crime in the country. The original founders hoped that CARI would
provide a comprehensive service for children and families facing the
consequences of experiencing sexual abuse.

#####  What is the CARI philosophy?

CARI believes that children have a right to a service that respects their
freedom of expression and right to child centred services. CARI respects the
strength and resilience of children and design our services to build on this
strength, enabling children to grow into adulthood defined not by their
abusive experiences but by their individuality and creativity.

#####  What is the current level of service provision for children affected by
CSA?

Inadequate funding means that CARI’s services are limited. However, we aim to
provide a service throughout Ireland and have already launched our first
outreach centre in the south east. We believe children, teenagers and families
affected by child sexual abuse should not have to travel more than an hour to
access therapy services.

In order to reach this level of service, we need more State funding and help
from the community to raise money to meet the funding shortfall.
