#  Ministers and Government departments

  * Introduction 
  * What do government ministers do? 
  * Departments and services 

##  Introduction

Each minister of the Government is responsible for running and managing the
department they have been allocated. There are 18 government departments. As
well as the Cabinet minister assigned to the department, The Taoiseach may
also appoint junior ministers, or Ministers of State to help run departments.

Each department employs a large number of [ civil servants ](/en/government-
in-ireland/how-government-works/national-government/the-civil-service/) ,
including a Secretary General, who remain in their positions regardless of
changes in the Government. These officials advise and assist the minister in
the running of the department.

You can find out about government spending in each of these departments on [
whereyourmoneygoes.gov.ie ](http://www.whereyourmoneygoes.gov.ie/en/) . You
can also read about the responsibilities of the people who manage government
departments on [ whodoeswhat.gov.ie. ](https://whodoeswhat.gov.ie/)

##  What do government ministers do?

The minister is responsible for their department and the Taoiseach can remove
a minister at any time. Ministers are part of the Government and sit at
cabinet meetings, where decisions about government policy and proposals for
new Government bills are decided.

The minister may suggest and propose new or amended [ legislation
](/en/government-in-ireland/houses-of-the-oireachtas/legislation/) to the
Government relating to matters that arise in their department.

Ministers also have a power to make _Statutory Instruments_ which are also
known as delegated or [ secondary legislation ](/en/government-in-
ireland/houses-of-the-oireachtas/legislation#l5055d) . A Minister may only
make a Statutory Instrument if they are permitted to do so in primary
legislation. For example, the Immigration Act 2004 gives the Minister for
Justice the power to make an order adding or removing a country from the list
of countries whose citizens need a visa to enter Ireland.

You can view all [ Irish Government legislation
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/) from 1922 onwards.
