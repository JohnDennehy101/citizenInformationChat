##  Who is a mature student?

If you wish to enter or return to third-level education and you are over 23
years of age, you can be considered a mature student. Irish third-level
colleges have set aside a number of [ places for mature students
](/en/education/third-level-education/applying-to-college/third-level-courses-
for-mature-students/) .

You will have to consider the costs of fees and maintaining yourself while
studying. The cost will depend on whether you are going to do a full-time or
part-time course.

##  Free Fees Initiative and Student Grant Scheme

Depending on your circumstances, you may be eligible for:

  * The [ Free Fees Initiative ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/education/third-level-education/fees-and-supports-for-third-level-education/fees/)
  * The [ Student Grant Scheme ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/education/third-level-education/fees-and-supports-for-third-level-education/student-grant-scheme/)

###  **Free fees initiative**

To qualify for free fees, you must meet criteria based on:

  * Residence 
  * Nationality and immigration status 
  * Course requirements 

Read more about the [ eligibility criteria for free third-level fees
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/education/third-level-education/fees-
and-supports-for-third-level-education/fees/#0434eb) .

Your eligibility for free fees is assessed using the information you give when
applying for a college place.

###  **Student Grant Scheme**

If you are **a full-time student** studying an approved course, you can apply
to [ Student Universal Support Ireland (SUSI) ](https://www.susi.ie/how-to-
apply/index.html) for a student grant. All types of students including mature
students can apply for funding.

To be eligible for a student grant, you must meet certain criteria including:

  * Nationality and residency 
  * Approved course of study and progression 
  * Income 

Your reckonable income, calculated for grant purposes, must fall under
specific thresholds.

Read more on the [ eligibility criteria for a student grant
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/education/third-level-education/fees-
and-supports-for-third-level-education/student-grant-scheme/#19584a) .

If you are applying for an undergraduate course and you have already completed
an undergraduate course, you are **not** eligible for either a student grant
or free fees. However, in certain circumstances, [ you may be considered
eligible for funding ](https://www.susi.ie/eligibility-criteria/previous-
education-and-progression/) , for example, if you attended a course previously
but did not complete it.

If you are studying certain **part-time undergraduate courses** , you can
apply to SUSI for the [ part-time fee scheme
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/education/third-level-education/fees-
and-supports-for-third-level-education/part-time-fee-scheme-for-undergraduate-
courses/) .

You may be eligible for a grant if you are starting a [ Post-Leaving
Certificate (PLC) ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/education/further-
education-and-training/post-leaving-certificate-courses/) course as part of
the [ tertiary education programme
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/education/third-level-
education/applying-to-college/tertiary-education-programme/) leading to a
higher-level qualification than your previous undergraduate qualification.

[ Funding is available for postgraduate students
](https://www.susi.ie/eligibility-criteria/income/postgraduate-income-
thresholds-and-grant-award-rates/) under the Student Grant Scheme for
**approved postgraduate courses** in Ireland and Northern Ireland. You cannot
get support under the Scheme for courses elsewhere in the EU. Read more about
[ postgraduate student grants
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/education/third-level-education/fees-
and-supports-for-third-level-education/postgraduate-student-grant/) .

[ Student Universal Support Ireland (SUSI) ](https://www.susi.ie/) handles all
applications for student grants. You must [ apply for your grant online
](https://grantsonline.ie/auth/esr.elogin) . Applications for the 2024-2025
academic year are open.

###  Tax relief on fees

If you have to pay fees, you may be able to get [ tax relief on the fees you
pay ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/education/third-level-
education/fees-and-supports-for-third-level-education/tax-relief-for-third-
level-fees/) at the standard rate of income tax.

##  Back to Education Allowance

If you are getting an unemployment, One-Parent Family or disability payment,
the [ Back to Education Allowance (BTEA)
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/back-to-education/back-
to-education-allowance/) allows you to study at second and third level without
losing your benefits. You must meet certain criteria to be eligible for the
BTEA. If you are studying part-time, you may be able to keep your benefits
under the [ Back to Education Programme.
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/back-to-education/back-
to-education-programme/)

You can apply for the [ Back to Education Allowance (BTEA)
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/back-to-education/back-
to-education-allowance/) , or other strands of the [ Back to Education
Programme ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/back-to-
education/back-to-education-programme/) , by filling in the [ Back to
Education Allowance application form (pdf)
](https://assets.gov.ie/34307/dc7a224c23e9494caaa434e133e74d0b.pdf) . This
form is also available from your local [ Intreo Centre
](https://www.gov.ie/en/service/40cf48-find-your-local-intreo-office/?fl=en) .

Send the form to the office that deals with applications from people on your
particular payment. These offices are listed on the back of the form.

If you are getting the Back to Education Allowance or you are on a [ Post-
Leaving Certificate course
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/education/further-education-and-
training/post-leaving-certificate-courses/) and getting a [ VTOS allowance
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/education/further-education-and-
training/vocational-training-opportunities-scheme/) , you are not eligible for
the maintenance component of the student grant. However, you may get an
exemption from college fees or the student contribution, so you should
complete a student grant application.

](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/back-to-
education/social-welfare-payments-and-the-student-grant/) .
