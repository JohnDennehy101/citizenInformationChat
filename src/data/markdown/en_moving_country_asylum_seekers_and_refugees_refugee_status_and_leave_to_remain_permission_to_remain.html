##  Introduction

When you [ apply for international protection ](/en/moving-country/asylum-
seekers-and-refugees/the-asylum-process-in-ireland/applying-for-refugee-
status-in-ireland/) , the International Protection Office (IPO) must decide if
you qualify for [ refugee status ](/en/moving-country/asylum-seekers-and-
refugees/the-asylum-process-in-ireland/refugees-asylum-seekers-
introduction#lad40a) or [ subsidiary protection ](/en/moving-country/asylum-
seekers-and-refugees/the-asylum-process-in-ireland/refugees-asylum-seekers-
introduction#l50016) status. The IPO makes a recommendation, which it gives to
the Minister for Justice.

If the IPO recommends that you should not be granted refugee or subsidiary
protection status, the Minister must then decide if you should be granted
permission to remain. You can appeal the IPO recommendation

You don’t make a separate application for permission to remain. You must
provide information about your personal situation when you apply for
international protection. The Minister makes a decision based on this
information. You can send extra information if your situation changes.

The Minister’s power to grant permission to remain as part of the
international protection process is set out in [ Section 49 of the
International Protection Act 2015
](https://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2015/act/66/section/49/enacted/en/html)
.

##  How to apply for permission to remain

This information is about permission to remain for international protection
applicants. You can read about [ residence permissions for non-EEA citizens
](/en/moving-country/moving-to-ireland/rights-of-residence-in-
ireland/residence-rights-of-non-eea-nationals-in-ireland/) .

When you [ apply for international protection ](/en/moving-country/asylum-
seekers-and-refugees/the-asylum-process-in-ireland/applying-for-refugee-
status-in-ireland/) , you must complete a questionnaire, and attend interviews
where you give information about your history and your situation. Most of the
information you give is relevant to your application for international
protection.

Some of the information you give becomes more important if your application
for international protection is refused. For example, information you give
about your family in Ireland or any health conditions that you have are
considered by the Minister when deciding if you should get permission to
remain.

After the International Protection Office (IPO) has examined your case, it
makes a recommendation to the Minister for Justice. It recommends one of the
following:

  * You are declared a refugee 
  * You are granted subsidiary protection status 
  * You are not granted international protection 

If the IPO recommends that you should not be granted international protection
(either refugee status or subsidiary protection status), you may [ appeal this
decision ](/en/moving-country/asylum-seekers-and-refugees/the-asylum-process-
in-ireland/if-your-application-for-refugee-status-is-refused/) to the
International Protection Appeals Tribunal.

The Minister for Justice will then decide if you should be granted permission
to remain. The Minister will make a decision on if you should be granted
permission to remain whether or not you have appealed the International
Protection decision.

The Minister may grant you permission to remain before your international
protection appeal has been completed.

##  How the Minister decides on your application

The International Protection Act sets out what the Minister should consider
when making a decision to grant or refuse permission to remain.

  * The nature of your connection to Ireland 
  * Humanitarian considerations 
  * Your character and conduct both in Ireland and abroad, including criminal convictions 
  * National security and public order 
  * Any other considerations of the common good 

The Minister must also consider if there is a risk that returning you to
another country could lead you to suffer harm. In particular, the Minister
will consider if you are at risk of [ torture, degrading treatment
](/en/moving-country/asylum-seekers-and-refugees/the-asylum-process-in-
ireland/refugees-asylum-seekers-introduction#l5c4cf) or of facing the death
penalty.

The Minister uses the information you gave during your application for
international protection to make a decision. You can send further information
if you want to.

If the Minister decides to grant you leave to remain, you will get a letter
that says you have been granted permission to remain in the State under
Section 49 of the International Protection Act. You must [ register with your
local immigration registration office ](/en/moving-country/moving-to-
ireland/rights-of-residence-in-ireland/registration-of-non-eea-nationals-in-
ireland/) . You will get a [ Stamp 4 permission
](https://www.irishimmigration.ie/registering-your-immigration-
permission/information-on-registering/immigration-permission-stamps/) , which
allows you to work without an employment permit.

##  Decisions and appeals

If you have appealed the IPO’s recommendation that you should not be granted
refugee or subsidiary protection status, you may get a decision on your
permission to remain application before your appeal is heard.

If you get permission to remain, you can choose to withdraw your appeal. You
do not have to withdraw your appeal. You can register and get a Stamp 4 Irish
Residence Permit and wait for the outcome of your international protection
appeal. You will continue to be considered as an international protection
applicant, and you can only work if you apply for [ Labour Market Access
Permission ](https://www.irishimmigration.ie/my-situation-has-changed-since-i-
arrived-in-ireland/labour-market-access-permission/) .

You cannot appeal a refusal of your permission to remain application. But if
your international protection appeal is refused, you will get a Permission to
Remain Review Form to complete. You can use this form to tell the Minister
about any changes in your circumstances since the Minister refused to grant
you permission to remain.

You should consult with your solicitor about what to do if your permission to
remain is refused. Your solicitor may suggest making an application for a [
judicial review ](/en/government-in-ireland/how-government-works/standards-
and-accountability/judicial-review-public-decisions/) of the decision. This
involves going to court to argue that the decision making process was flawed.

You may also [ voluntarily return ](https://ireland.iom.int/return-and-
reintegration) to your own country.

If you have been refused permission to remain and decide not to return
voluntarily to your own country, the Minister may issue a [ deportation order
](https://www.irishimmigration.ie/my-situation-has-changed-since-i-arrived-in-
ireland/spouse-civil-partner-of-irish-national-scheme/repatriation-division/)
.
