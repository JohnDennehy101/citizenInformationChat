##  What is the Home School Community Liaison Scheme?

The [ Home School Community Liaison Scheme
](https://www.gov.ie/en/service/6c72da-home-school-community-liaison-scheme-
hscl/) (HSCL) supports students with poor attendance at school and who are at
risk of leaving school early.

The Scheme is funded through the Department of Education and is managed by [
Tusla’s Educational Support Service (TESS) ](https://www.tusla.ie/tess/) .

The HSCL Scheme aims to:

  * Support parents to be a resource to their own children and become involved in their child’s education 
  * Promote co-operation between home, school and relevant community agencies in the educational interests of the child 
  * Work with parents to prepare and support them as a resource to their own children and encourage parents to become involved in their child’s education 
  * Help the child’s learning and improve their chances of staying in school 

The HSCL co-ordinator is a designated teacher in the school. The HSCL co-
ordinator can:

  * Make home visits 
  * Organise parent classes and other courses 
  * Support families as their child moves through the education system 

The coordinator works closely with the [ School Completion Programme and the
Educational Welfare Service ](/en/education/the-irish-education-
system/measures-to-address-educational-disadvantage/) .

###  HSCL home visits

The home visit is one of the key ways the HSCL co-ordinator works with the
family to improve the child’s progress at school.

The co-ordinator visits parents in the family home or can meet them in the
child’s school, Family Resource Centre or other suitable location, if
necessary.

During the home visit the HSCL co-ordinator hears parent’s views and brings
information about the school and services in the community.

##  How can I access the Home School Community Liaison Scheme?

The HSCL is available in all urban DEIS schools (band 1 and band 2) and in all
DEIS post-primary schools. You can see the [ list of DEIS schools
](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/7938e-list-of-schools-into-deis/) .

The school will identify children who need HSCL support.

You should contact the school principal if you need further information.

You can read more in the [ Information booklet for DEIS schools participating
the Home School Liaison Scheme ](https://www.gov.ie/pdf/39197/?page=1) and on
the [ Department of Education’s website
](https://www.gov.ie/en/service/6c72da-home-school-community-liaison-scheme-
hscl/) .
