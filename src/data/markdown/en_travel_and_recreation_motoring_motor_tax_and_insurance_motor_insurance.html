##  Introduction

You [ must have motor insurance
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1961/act/24/section/56/enacted/en/html#sec56)
to drive your vehicle on Irish roads.

Motor insurance is meant to protect you against liability [ in an accident
](/en/travel-and-recreation/motoring/motor-accidents/) . It will cover the
costs of the other driver's property and injuries if you are found at fault
for an accident. If you are involved in an accident and found not to be at
fault, the insurance of the responsible party will cover your costs.

When you buy a motor insurance policy from an insurance company, you will get
an insurance disc and a certificate of insurance. You [ must clearly display a
current insurance disc
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1984/si/355/made/en/print) on your
vehicle at all times when driving.

You don't need to provide your car insurance details anymore. The Motor
Insurers' Bureau of Ireland manages the Irish Motor Insurance Database (IMID).
The database contains policy holder and vehicle registration details provided
by insurers, brokers, fleet owners, and traders. An Garda Síochána uses this
database to enforce motor insurance requirements.

This page aims to provide practical guidance and advice on how motor insurance
works in Ireland.

It includes information on:

  * Types of insurance cover 
  * Cost of insurance cover 
  * How to shop for insurance 
  * Motor insurance and driving abroad 

You can get guidance on what you must do if you are involved in a road traffic
collision on [ An Garda Síochána’s website
](https://www.garda.ie/en/crime/traffic-matters/i%E2%80%99ve-been-involved-in-
a-road-traffic-collision-what-should-i-do-.html) . The Government of Ireland
has information on [ how to make an insurance claim
](https://www.gov.ie/en/policy-information/666f59-motor-insurance/#accidents-
in-ireland-caused-by-an-insured-irish-motorist-making-a-claim) if you are
involved in a road traffic accident.

##  Types of insurance cover

There are 3 types of motor insurance available in Ireland:

  * Third party 
  * Third party fire and theft 
  * Comprehensive insurance 

Which you choose will depend on the level of cover you need and how much you
are willing to pay.

###  Third party

Third party insurance is the [ minimum level of motor insurance
](https://www.gov.ie/en/policy-information/666f59-motor-insurance/#compulsory-
motor-insurance) needed in Ireland and [ throughout the European Union (EU)
](/en/government-in-ireland/european-government/european-union/european-
union/) for all vehicles.

If you are involved in an accident and are at fault, third party insurance
will only compensate the other parties involved. This could be for damage to
their vehicle or any injuries that they sustain (including your passengers).
You will not get any compensation for damage to your vehicle or injury to your
person.

Third party insurance provides no cover for loss or damage to your vehicle due
to fire or theft.

###  Third party fire and theft

Third party fire and theft is the most popular type of motor insurance in
Ireland. It provides the same level of cover as third party but with added
cover if your vehicle is stolen or damaged by fire. If you are at fault for an
accident, third party, fire and theft will not cover you for damages to your
vehicle or any injuries that you sustain.

###  Comprehensive

Comprehensive insurance is, in most cases, the most expensive coverage on the
market. It provides the same cover as third party fire and theft; however, it
also allows you to claim for accidental damage to your own vehicle, no matter
who is to blame in the case of a collision.

Although comprehensive insurance generally provides you with the most cover in
the event of an accident, such policies typically only cover the cost of
damage to the vehicle and do not compensate drivers for injuries to their
person.

###  Driving without insurance

Failure to have motor insurance or driving without insurance in Ireland is
generally punishable by:

  * A fine of up to €5,000 
  * 5 penalty points; and 
  * At the discretion of the court, a term of imprisonment not exceeding 6 months. 

The court may decide that you will be disqualified from driving instead of
incurring penalty points. In that case, you will be disqualified for 2 years
or more for a first offence and 4 years or more in the case of a second
offence committed within 3 years of the first.

You should note that where a member of An Garda Síochána believes that a
vehicle registered in Ireland (or outside Ireland) is being used in a public
place without insurance, the vehicle may be impounded.

###  Accidents involving an uninsured driver

In the case of accidents with uninsured or untraced drivers, the [ Motor
Insurers’ Bureau of Ireland (MIBI) ](https://www.mibi.ie/) is the body which
compensates the victims.

At the same time, any claim for personal injury must be sent to the [ Injuries
Resolution Board ](https://www.piab.ie/) . This is the statutory body which
provides independent assessment of personal injury compensation for victims of
workplace, motor and public liability accidents.

##  Cost of insurance cover

An insurance premium is the monthly or annual payment you make to an insurance
company to keep your policy active.

The cost of your premium is determined by the level of risk an insurer
considers you to pose as a driver. In some cases, an insurer may impose an
extra charge to a standard premium to reflect any additional risk assumed.
This is referred to as a ‘loading’.

You must disclose all relevant information to an insurer when initially buying
or renewing your insurance. Otherwise, the policy you buy may subsequently be
deemed null and void. If you are unsure whether certain facts are relevant,
you should disclose them to the insurer and it is then up to the insurer to
decide.

Since 1 July 2022, [ insurance companies cannot charge premium increases if
you stay longer with the same provider
](https://www.centralbank.ie/regulation/industry-market-sectors/insurance-
reinsurance/home-and-motor-insurance-rules) . If your motor insurance renews
automatically, they must also provide additional information that is
consistent with other providers. This is to help you consider if you should
switch providers.

###  Factors that determine the cost of your insurance

Insurance companies will consider the following factors in calculating the
cost of your premium:

**Experience** . In general, the less experience you have as a driver, the
higher your premium is likely to be. Whether you are driving on a full or
provisional licence makes a huge difference to the cost of your motor
insurance premium. If you only have a provisional licence, you can expect to
pay hundreds of euro extra on your premium.

**Claims history** . All insurance companies will ask if you have ever had
insurance in your own name before. If not, they will ask if you have ever
driven under someone else's insurance without incident. This will be taken
into account when calculating a premium. Insurance becomes less expensive with
experience and a clean driving record.

**Where you live** . Those living in a major city, particularly Dublin, will
normally have a loading imposed. Some companies will also impose a loading if
the vehicle is not kept in a garage or driveway at night.

**Size of your vehicle** . The larger your vehicle’s engine, the more
expensive it will be to insure. This owes to the fact that, statistically, the
faster and more powerful your vehicle is, the more likely it is to be involved
in an accident.

**Age of your vehicle** . The older your vehicle, the more difficult it can be
to insure.

**Value of your vehicle** . The value of a vehicle is taken into account when
calculating a premium for third party fire and theft, and comprehensive
insurance. A new vehicle is more expensive to replace than an old vehicle and
will cost more to insure.

**Your age** . The young and the old are considered by insurance companies to
represent high-risk categories of driver and are consequently made to pay
higher premiums.

**Profession and use** . A standard motor insurance policy will only cover the
vehicle for social, domestic and pleasure purposes, but not for the carriage
of goods. If the vehicle is being used for business purposes, then a loading
will apply. If the vehicle is being used commercially, then an even higher
loading will be imposed.

**Level of cover required** . In most cases, third party insurance will incur
a lower premium than third party fire and theft cover, while comprehensive
insurance is generally the most expensive form of cover. Many insurers also
offer optional extra forms of cover that increase the cost of your premium.
These additional forms of cover may include: no claims bonus protection,
windscreen cover, damaged or stolen personal items, emergency and recovery
service, and cover for a rental vehicle in the event of your own vehicle being
off the road.

**Excess** . Most insurance policies contain some type of an excess clause.
This means that you are liable for an agreed amount towards the cost of any
claim (e.g., the first 250 euro). You will not be able to claim for amounts
less than the excess. In most cases, opting to pay a high excess on claims
lowers the cost of your premium.

###  What is a no-claims bonus and how does it work?

Most insurers offer a premium discount for motorists with a claims free
record: this is referred to as a ‘no claims bonus’ or a ‘no claims discount’.
You are typically awarded a percentage discount on your premium on a sliding
upward scale for each year of claims free driving up to a maximum of 5 years.
The ceiling for a no claims bonus is usually around 60%, leaving someone who
has never had a claim with only 40% to pay.

Your no claims bonus can be transferred from one insurance company to another,
and from one vehicle to another. However, each no claims bonus is specific to
one vehicle at a time; therefore, if you have two vehicles, you will need to
work up a no claims bonus for each vehicle. If you have no insurance in your
own name for 2 or more years, many insurers will not give you your no claims
discount when you reapply for insurance cover.

###  If you are refused motor insurance

Individual insurers have the right to refuse you cover, but they must provide
you with a reason for the refusal should you ask for one. If you have been
refused cover, you are entitled to go to the [ Declined Cases Committee of
Insurance Ireland ](https://www.insuranceireland.eu/consumer-
information/general-non-life-insurance/declined-cases-agreement) who will get
an insurance quotation for you. In order for the Committee to consider your
case you must first have sought and been refused quotations in writing from at
least 3 insurers.

##  How to shop for insurance

Before buying motor insurance, you should shop around and get quotes from a
number of different companies to identify the policy that best meets your
needs and budget.

The Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CPCC) has [ a checklist
(pdf) ](https://www.ccpc.ie/consumers/wp-
content/uploads/sites/2/2020/03/Motor-insurance-shopping-around-checklist.pdf)
you can use to compare the policies offered by different insurers, as well as
[ guidance ](https://www.ccpc.ie/consumers/money/insurance/car-
insurance/#think-about) on practical steps you can take to cut the cost of
your premium.

This includes:

  * Paying your insurance in one go 
  * Getting your full driving licence 
  * Avoiding driving convictions and penalty points 
  * Parking your vehicle in a secure location 
  * Adding experienced named drivers to your policy 
  * Paying a higher excess 
  * Avoiding using your personal vehicle for professional purposes 

###  Young Drivers

If you are a young driver, you should consider joining a parent's insurance
policy as a named driver. This will enable you to establish a safety record
and may reduce the cost of your premium in the future. Some companies offer
discounts to young people seeking insurance in their own name if they have
been a named driver.

However, you must not engage in the practice of ‘fronting’; that is, where the
main driver of a vehicle (typically a son or daughter) declares a more
experienced driver as the main driver (usually a parent) to reduce the cost of
their insurance premium. Fronting is illegal and can result in the
cancellation of your motor insurance policy or a fraud conviction.

###  Insurance brokers

You can consult an insurance broker (or ‘intermediary’) when searching for the
policy that best meets your needs. Regulated by [ the Central Bank of Ireland
](https://www.centralbank.ie/regulation/industry-market-sectors/brokers-
retail-intermediaries/insurance-brokers-intermediaries) , the role of an
insurance broker is to provide expert, impartial advice to individuals and
businesses seeking to purchase insurance. They may also be employed to
negotiate with insurance companies on behalf of their clients to get the best
possible deal. You can [ search a database of registered insurance brokers
](https://brokersireland.ie/broker/) throughout Ireland.

###  Renewing your motor insurance

In most cases, you will need to renew your insurance policy every 12 months.
This can generally be done online, in person or over the phone. Be aware that
premiums frequently change at the point of renewal so it pays to shop around
and get quotes from different companies before renewing your policy with the
same insurer.

Your motor insurance company must issue your insurance renewal notice at least
20 working days before the date of expiry of your insurance policy. Your no
claims discount certificate also be included with the renewal notice. You will
need this certificate if you want to renew your motor insurance with a
different insurance company.

When your insurance is due for renewal, your insurance provider must give you:

  * Details of the premium paid for motor insurance in the previous year 
  * Quotations for all the policy options available to you, such as comprehensive, third party fire and theft, and third party only 
  * Information in Plain English, so that you can make an informed decision 

##  Motor insurance and driving abroad

###  Driving in the EU

In general, if you buy a motor insurance policy from an EU-based insurance
company you will have the [ minimum compulsory level of insurance
](https://ec.europa.eu/info/business-economy-euro/banking-and-
finance/insurance-and-pensions/motor-insurance_en) required to drive in any EU
country. However, you should always tell your insurance company if you plan to
take your vehicle abroad and check with them what exactly is covered on your
policy.

You can usually take your car for up to 31 days to another EU member state for
no extra charge. Your existing cover can be extended for stays of up to 60 or
90 days duration but you may have to pay an additional fee for this cover. You
can pay for additional forms cover while driving abroad, such as break down
assistance.

](https://www.gov.ie/en/policy-information/666f59-motor-insurance/#accidents-
abroad-caused-by-an-insured-motorist-normally-resident-in-another-member-
state) if you are involved in a road traffic collision with an insured or
uninsured driver in another EU member state.

###  Driving outside the EU

If you drive your car in a non-EU country, you should check with your insurer
to find out about what you need to do to make sure that you are covered in the
relevant jurisdiction.

In some cases, your insurer will issue you with a Green Card. The [ Green Card
system ](https://www.cobx.org/article/4130/green-card-system-final) is a
protection mechanism for victims of cross-border road traffic accidents
consisting of 46 member countries. The Green Card demonstrates to local law
enforcement authorities that you have the minimum compulsory level of
insurance required to drive legally in a participating jurisdiction.

Green Cards are no longer needed for UK registered motor vehicles, including
those from Northern Ireland, travelling to the Republic of Ireland or any
other EU country.

###  **Green cards for Russia and Belarusian cars**

Since 1 June 2023, [ Ireland, and other EEA States have stopped recognising
green cards for Russia and Belarusian cars. ](https://www.mibi.ie/belarus-and-
russia-suspended-from-green-card-system/) This means that green cards will no
longer be accepted as proof of insurance in EEA States. Any Irish cars
travelling to Russia or Belarus will need additional frontier (third party)
insurance on or after 1 June 2023.

The Motor Insurers Bureau of Ireland (MIBI) has [ guidance on Green Cards
](https://www.mibi.ie/brexit/what-are-green-cards/) .
