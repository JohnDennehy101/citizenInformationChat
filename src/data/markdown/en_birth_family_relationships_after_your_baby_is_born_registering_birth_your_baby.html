##  Introduction

The HSE's [ Civil Registration Service ](https://www2.hse.ie/services/births-
deaths-and-marriages/find-a-civil-registration-service/) registers all births,
deaths and marriages in Ireland.

Once the birth is registered, your baby will be given a [ PPS number
](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/personal-public-service-
number/) and you can [ get a birth certificate ](/en/birth-family-
relationships/getting-birth-marriage-or-death-certificate/) (which you will
need to [ enrol your child in school ](/en/education/primary-and-post-primary-
education/going-to-primary-school/starting-primary-school/) , to [ apply for a
passport ](/en/travel-and-recreation/passports/applying-for-or-renewing-an-
irish-passport/) and for many other purposes).

You must register the birth of your child within 3 months of their birth,
where possible. However, you have up to 12 months to register the birth in
some circumstances. If you need to register a birth after 12 months, contact
the [ Civil Registration Service ](https://www2.hse.ie/services/births-deaths-
and-marriages/find-a-civil-registration-service/) for advice.

##  When your baby is born

A Birth Notification Form (Form BNF/01) is usually completed with the
parent(s) by hospital staff (in the case of hospital births), or by a doctor
or midwife (in home births), to guarantee that accurate information is
recorded.

The Birth Notification Form outlines the information to be recorded in the
Register of Births. If your child is born in hospital, the form is sent to the
Registrar's office, letting the Registrar know that a birth has occurred.

If your child was born at home with the support of a healthcare professional,
they should give you the signed Birth Notification Form. It must include their
registration and PIN. Bring this with you to your appointment to register your
child's birth.

##  When to register a birth

You must register the birth of your baby within 3 months of their birth.
However, you have up to 12 months to register the birth in some circumstances.
If you need to register a birth after 12 months, contact the [ Civil
Registration Service ](https://www2.hse.ie/services/births-deaths-and-
marriages/find-a-civil-registration-service/) for advice.

If a birth is registered within 3 months, the information will be
automatically sent to the Department of Social Protection, and Child Benefit
forms and a PPS number will be sent automatically to the qualified informant,
usually the parent(s).

If you register your baby’s birth after 3 months, you will have to contact
Client Identity Services and the Department of Social Protection to arrange
the PPS number and Child Benefit.

If you had a hospital birth, you should wait 3 weeks after the birth before
booking an appointment to register the birth (for a hospital birth only). If
your baby was born at home, you can book an appointment at any time.

##  How to register a birth

There is no fee for registration of a birth.

You can register your child’s birth at any [ Civil Registration Service
](https://www2.hse.ie/services/births-deaths-and-marriages/find-a-civil-
registration-service/) , regardless of where the birth took place. For
convenience, most people will choose their local office. If you register the
birth at a Civil Registration Office, you must sign the Register of Births to
complete to process of registration.

  * **By post or email  
** To register a birth, complete a [ Birth Registration Application form (pdf)
](https://assets.hse.ie/media/documents/birth-registration-application-form-
march-2023_1.pdf) and post or email the completed form to your chosen [ Civil
Registration Office ](https://www2.hse.ie/services/births-deaths-and-
marriages/find-a-civil-registration-service/) . All births can be registered
using this form but you also must attend the office to sign the Register of
Births to complete to process of registration. Your child's birth will not be
registered until you sign the register. The Registrar will let you know when
you can attend to sign the register.  
  

  * **In-person  
** Alternatively, you can complete the [ Birth Registration Application form
(pdf) ](https://assets.hse.ie/media/documents/birth-registration-application-
form-march-2023_1.pdf) and bring it with you to your appointment at the [
Civil Registration Office ](https://www2.hse.ie/services/births-deaths-and-
marriages/find-a-civil-registration-service/) . Depending on the Civil
Registration Service you chose, [ you may be able to book an appointment
online ](https://crsbirths.hse.ie/hse-self-referral/?flow=birth) or by phone.
Walk-ins are available in some offices at certain times. Use the HSE’s [ Find
a Civil Registration Service ](https://www2.hse.ie/services/births-deaths-and-
marriages/find-a-civil-registration-service/) to find out how to contact your
local office.  
  

  * **Online  
** From 12 August 2024, [ some parents will be invited to register the birth
of their baby online ](https://civilregistration.mywelfare.ie/WhoCanRegister)
on [ MyWelfare.ie ](https://services.mywelfare.ie/) using their [ verified
MyGovID account ](/en/government-in-ireland/how-government-
works/egovernment/mygovid/) .  
  
You need:

    * A [ verified MyGovID account ](/en/government-in-ireland/how-government-works/egovernment/mygovid/) . Both parents need a verified MyGovID account if you are not married to each other. Find out more about [ getting a verified MyGovID account ](/en/government-in-ireland/how-government-works/egovernment/mygovid/) . 
    * The birth notification ID. The online birth registration service can only be accessed using a unique birth notification ID issued to the mother by the Civil Registration Office by post. 

There are some registration scenarios that cannot be completed online at this
time. Contact your local [ Civil Registration Office
](https://www2.hse.ie/services/births-deaths-and-marriages/find-a-civil-
registration-service/) to find out how to register the birth of a child if
either parent is:

  * Separated (still legally married) 
  * Divorced 
  * Widowed 
  * Deceased 
  * Registering a birth where both parents wish to be registered as a same sex couple 
  * Registering a donor-conceived birth 
  * Registering a still birth 

After you register the birth, you can get your baby’s birth certificate. There
is a [ €20 fee for a full standard birth certificate ](/en/birth-family-
relationships/after-your-baby-is-born/registering-birth-your-baby#l62fd2) .

##  Who can register a birth?

The parent(s) of the child usually register the birth. This is because they
are the main _qualified informants_ . For a list of other qualified
informants, see ‘If the parents cannot register the birth’ below.

From 12 August 2024, [ some parents can register the birth of their baby
online ](https://civilregistration.mywelfare.ie/WhoCanRegister) on [
MyWelfare.ie ](https://services.mywelfare.ie/) using their [ verified MyGovID
account ](/en/government-in-ireland/how-government-works/egovernment/mygovid/)
(see ‘How to register a birth’ above).

If you are attending a Civil Registration Service in person, you must bring
photo identification, for example, a passport or driving licence, and your PPS
Number to the appointment to register the birth. In some cases, you may need
to provide additional information, for example, if a mother has been married
previously. Contact the [ Civil Registration Service
](https://www2.hse.ie/services/births-deaths-and-marriages/find-a-civil-
registration-service/) to find out more.

###  Married parents

If the parents are in a recognised marriage to each other, only one parent
needs to register the birth. From 12 August 2024, [ some parents may be
invited to register online
](https://civilregistration.mywelfare.ie/WhoCanRegister) . One or both of you
can attend the Civil Registration Service (if you both want to sign the
register). If you were married in another country, you should bring the
original marriage certificate (and a translation, if required).

###  Unmarried parents (registering the birth for the first time)

There are different options for registering the birth of a child where the
parents are not married. From 12 August 2024, [ some parents can do this
online ](https://civilregistration.mywelfare.ie/WhoCanRegister) .

If you register the birth of your child at a Civil Registration Service, you
can get the different forms from the Registrar's office. The options are:

  * Both the mother and father can jointly request the registration (Form CRA 9). Both attend the Registrar's office together and sign the register jointly. 
  * The mother can complete a declaration form naming the father (Form CRA 1) and bring it, along with a declaration by the baby's father acknowledging that he is the father of the child (Form CRA 3). The mother signs the register. 
  * The father can complete a declaration form acknowledging that he is the father of the child (Form CRA 2), and can go to the Registrar's office himself, bringing with him a declaration by the mother naming the father (Form CRA 4). The father signs the register. 
  * The mother or father can make a written request (Form CRA 5 and Form CRA 6 respectively) on production of a _certified copy of a court order_ , which names the person to be registered as the father. The parent making the request will be required to attend at the office of the Registrar to sign the Register of Births. 

It is also possible to enter the father's details if the mother is (or was)
married to someone else. As well as a sworn declaration from the father
stating he is the father, one of the following is required:

  * A sworn declaration by the mother's husband stating he is not the father, or 
  * A sworn declaration by the mother stating she has been living apart from her husband for more than 10 months before the birth of the child and a deed of separation/decree of divorce (not all foreign divorces are recognised under Irish law), or 
  * A certified copy of a court order which names the person to be registered as the father 

A [ leaflet on Birth Registration of Children (pdf)
](https://www.treoir.ie/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Registration-of-Births.pdf)
is available on [ Treoir's website ](http://www.treoir.ie/) .

If the parents of a child are not married to each other, there is no
presumption in law as to who the father of the child is, unless the father's
name is on the birth certificate. However, having the father's name on the
child’s birth certificate does not give the father any legal rights in respect
of their child. You can read more about [ Legal guardianship and cohabiting
couples ](/en/birth-family-relationships/cohabiting-couples/guardianship-and-
cohabiting-couples/) , and about establishing paternity in our page [
Presumption of paternity ](/en/birth-family-relationships/separation-and-
divorce/presumption-of-paternity/) .

###  Parents of a donor-conceived child

From 5 May 2020, the birth mother and the other parent (the mother's spouse,
civil partner or cohabitant) of a donor-conceived child – born as a result of
a donor-assisted human reproduction (DAHR) procedure – can register as parents
with the Registrar for Births, Deaths and Marriages, and get a birth
certificate for the child which reflects this. These provisions apply to:

  * Opposite sex couples 
  * Female same-sex couples 
  * Single women undergoing a donor-assisted human reproduction procedure. 

The process of registering the child’s birth will vary depending on the date
the baby was conceived (not the date the child is born).

####  **Baby conceived after 4 May 2020**

If the baby is conceived **after** 4 May 2020 (in a DAHR facility in Ireland
using a traceable sperm donor), the DAHR facility will give the parents a
certificate. The certificate will contain various details in relation to the
DAHR procedure and a record of the consent of the parent(s) to the parentage
of the child. This certificate will need to be submitted with an application
form to the General Register Office.

####  Baby conceived before 4 May 2020

If the baby was conceived **before** 4 May 2020, the birth must first be
registered as a non-DAHR birth. After the birth has been registered, a court
order naming another person as the parent of the child (a Declaration of
Parentage) is required prior to the re-registration of the birth. Find out [
how to apply for a Declaration of Parentage ](https://www.courts.ie/paternity-
and-declaration-parentage) on the Courts Service website.

If the DAHR procedure satisfies the requirements of the 2015 Act, the parents
can then [ apply to re-register the birth
](https://www.gov.ie/en/service/64a092-registering-a-birth/#how-to-re-
register-the-birth-of-a-donor-conceived-child) using a [ BRR1 application form
(pdf) ](https://assets.gov.ie/74316/41098c33193349f996a05f5a6f0645e6.pdf) and
attach a certified copy of the court order. Parents can email the completed
BRR1 form and the court order to [ dahr@welfare.ie ](mailto:dahr@welfare.ie)
or post to DAHR Section, General Register Office.

###  If the parents cannot register the birth

Where the parents do not register the birth, or it is not possible for them to
do it, the following people can also act as _qualified informants_ :

  * A designated member of the staff of the hospital (or other institution, organisation or enterprise) where the birth took place 
  * Any person present at the birth 
  * Any person present in the dwelling where the birth occurred 
  * Any person who has charge of the child 
  * A person appointed guardian of the child 
  * A person found to be the parent of the child by order of the courts 

###  Adoption

If you have adopted a child, whether from Ireland or overseas, registration is
processed by the [ Adoption Authority of Ireland ](https://aai.gov.ie/en/) .
For further information, see our pages on [ Adopting a child ](/en/birth-
family-relationships/adoption-and-fostering/domestic-adoption/) and [ Inter-
country adoptions ](/en/birth-family-relationships/adoption-and-
fostering/intercountry-adoption/) .

##  What information is recorded in the Register of Births?

The following information is recorded in the Register of Births:

  * Surname of the child. The surname registered must be the surname of either or both of the parents. If you want your child to have a surname other than the surname of either or both of the parents, you must [ apply to the Registrar General or a Superintendent Registrar (pdf) ](https://assets.gov.ie/74319/8270641186b64f07ad71f6a79d39f48a.pdf) to assign a different name. 
  * Time, date and place of birth of the child 
  * Gender of the child 
  * Personal Public Service Number (PPS Number) of the child (allocated at registration) 
  * Forename(s) and surname of the child 
  * Forename(s) and surname of the mother 
  * Birth surname of the mother 
  * All previously used surnames of the mother (if any) 
  * The mother's normal occupation 
  * The mother's normal address at the date of birth 
  * The mother's date of birth 
  * The mother's marital status 
  * The mother's Personal Public Service (PPS) number 
  * Birth surname of the mother's mother 

Similar information is entered for the father or other parent.

##  Re-registration of a birth to include name of the father

A birth can be re-registered to include the name of the father if any of the
following situations apply:

  * The parents of a child are not married to each other but wish to have the father's details included and these details were not registered initially. 
  * The parents of a child marry each other after the birth of the child. 

Contact a [ Civil Registration Service ](https://www2.hse.ie/services/births-
deaths-and-marriages/find-a-civil-registration-service/) to make an
appointment to re-register the birth and find out what documentation you need
to bring with you.

##  Re-registration of a birth to include other legal parent

You can re-register a birth if your child was conceived before 4 May 2020 as a
result of a donor-assisted human reproduction (DAHR) procedure and the mother
is recorded as the only legal parent in the Register of Births. See ‘Parents
of a donor-conceived child’ above.

##  Changing a surname or forename on the birth register

###  Changing a child's surname

If the birth has been registered, the child's surname cannot be changed
unless:

  * The birth is being re-registered at a later date to include the father's name, or 
  * Both parents were not married to one another at the time of registration but marry one another at a later date and apply to re-register the birth under [ Section 24 of the Civil Registration Act 2004 ](https://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2004/act/3/enacted/en/print#sec24)

In these circumstances, you can [ apply for the child's surname can be changed
(pdf) ](https://assets.gov.ie/74319/8270641186b64f07ad71f6a79d39f48a.pdf) (at
the request of both parents) when re-registering the birth. There is no fee
charged for re-registration to include a parent's details.

Contact the [ Civil Registration Service
](https://www2.hse.ie/services/births-deaths-and-marriages/find-a-civil-
registration-service/) to find out what documentation and information is
required.

###  Changing a child’s forename (first name)

Parents can apply to have their child’s forename registered, added or changed.
There is a fee of €5 for the insertion or alteration of a child's forename.

Contact your local [ Civil Registration Office
](https://www2.hse.ie/services/births-deaths-and-marriages/find-a-civil-
registration-service/) to discuss your request to add or change the child's
forename.

  1. You will need to complete and sign a CRA 16 form. This form will be provided by the Civil Registration Office 
  2. You will need original documentary evidence in support of the amendment, that is, proof that the child is using the forename(s), as you want them to read on the birth entry in the Register of Births, going as far back as possible. 

Examples of documentary evidence can include:

  * Church records (baptismal certificate/naming ceremony certificate) 
  * School or crèche records 
  * Public health records, hospital, GP records 
  * Passport, driver's licence, PPS Card, other government records 

If you have any original birth certificates they may be submitted with the
application for exchange.

The CRA 16 form must be signed by both parents.

  * If one parent is deceased the death certificate must be provided 
  * If the mother’s name only appears on the birth entry then only the mother needs to sign the CRA 16 form 
  * If both parents are deceased, contact the [ General Register Office ](https://www.gov.ie/en/campaigns/af7893-general-register-office/) , Government Offices, Convent Road, Roscommon, Co Roscommon to request the required form 

Contact your local [ Civil Registration Service
](https://www2.hse.ie/services/births-deaths-and-marriages/find-a-civil-
registration-service/) for further information.

###  Correction of errors

A birth certificate cannot be amended unless there are valid reasons to do so.
Contact the [ General Register Office
](https://www.gov.ie/en/campaigns/af7893-general-register-office/) for
information on what and when amendments can be made.

##  Birth certificates

A birth certificate contains information about the child and the parents given
at the time of registration, so it is important the information you give is
accurate. This record is a very important legal document. It is difficult to
change the details after the initial registration. (See 'Correction of errors'
below.)

###  Gender Recognition Certificates

You can apply for a [ Gender Recognition Certificate
](https://www.gov.ie/en/service/b55abf-gender-recognition-certificate/) in
order to have your preferred gender recognised by the State. This is set out
in the [ Gender Recognition Act 2015
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2015/act/25/enacted/en/html) . The Act
also provides for you to apply for a certified copy of an entry in the
Register of Gender Recognition. A certificate issued from the Register of
Gender Recognition is the same as a birth certificate and satisfies all
requirements where you are asked to provide a birth certificate.

###  Historical Irish birth records

The [ General Register Office
](https://www.gov.ie/en/campaigns/af7893-general-register-office/) is
responsible for storing and maintaining records relating to births,
stillbirths, adoptions, marriages, civil partnerships and deaths in Ireland.
The General Register Office holds all official records of Irish births, deaths
and marriages from 1864 and of non-Catholic marriages from 1845.

The General Register Office maintains a family research facility known as the
[ GRO Research Room ](https://www.gov.ie/en/organisation-information/55ccbe-
general-register-office-gro-research-facility/) at Werburgh Street, Dublin 2,
where you can search the indexes to the registers and purchase photocopies of
records. You can order certified copies of entries from the General Register
Office in Roscommon (see contact details below).

The Research Room has a walk-in service on Tuesdays only, from 10am – 12.30pm,
and from 2pm – 4.30pm. An email service is available 5 days a week at [
GROResearchRoom@welfare.ie ](mailto:GROResearchRoom@welfare.ie) . **Note:**
There is no walk-in service available at the Research Rooms from the 25 June
2024 due to urgent repair works on the building. The walk in service will re-
open on Tuesday, 27 August 2024. The Research Rooms continues to offer a full
email service.

You can also see [ historic church and civil records online
](https://civilrecords.irishgenealogy.ie/churchrecords/civil-search.jsp) .
Birth, marriage, adoption, civil partnership and death certificates are public
records, meaning anybody can access or apply for them.

##  How do I get a copy of a birth certificate?

You can [ get a copy of a birth certificate ](/en/birth-family-
relationships/getting-birth-marriage-or-death-certificate/) when you are
registering the birth. If you want to get a copy of a birth certificate at a
later stage, you can go directly to **any** Registrar's office or [ make an
application by email ](http://www.welfare.ie/en/downloads/E-mail-Application-
Form-in-English.pdf) or [ apply online ](https://certificatespublic-webapp-
prod.azurewebsites.net/) .

You can also apply for a copy of a birth certificate by post by sending a
letter with your request to your local [ Civil Registration Service
](https://www2.hse.ie/services/births-deaths-and-marriages/contact-a-civil-
registration-service.html) stating both parents' full names, the child's full
names, date and place of birth, a return address, a contact phone number and
enclosing payment. Payment of the relevant fees can be made by cheque or
postal order.

Adopted children's birth certificates are only available from the General
Register Office.

##  Fees for birth certificates

You can register a birth for free. However, you must pay a fee for birth
certificates.

The fees for a certificate are:

  * €20 for a full standard certificate 
  * €5 for an uncertified copy of an entry in the Register 
  * €10 to have a certificate authenticated (only available from the General Register Office) 
  * No fee for a Multilingual Standard Form. Since 2019, you can request a Multilingual Standard Form (MSF) for birth, death, marriage and civil partnership certificates. The purpose of an MSF is to provide a translation of the public document when presenting certificates to authorities in another EU member state. You must choose which EU language you require for the MSF, and it must be requested at the same time as when you apply for the certificate. 

You no longer need to provide copies of birth certificates for social welfare
purposes if you were born in Ireland and your birth is in the Register of
Births.

The Department of Social Protection can access this information directly. If
you want a copy of your birth certificate for any other reason, see the fees
set out above.

There is no charge for a birth certificate for a deceased child at the time of
registration if the deceased child was less than 12 months of age on the date
of death, and the birth and death are registered at the same time.  

##  Further information

You can get more information about registering a birth from [ your local HSE
Civil Registration Office ](https://www2.hse.ie/services/births-deaths-and-
marriages/contact-a-civil-registration-service.html) or the General Register
Office.
