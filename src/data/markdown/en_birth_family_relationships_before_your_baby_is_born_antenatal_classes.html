##  Introduction

If you are pregnant, antenatal classes can help you to prepare for [ labour
](https://www2.hse.ie/labour-and-birth/) , the birth of your baby, and
becoming a parent. Some classes also include practical advice on how to care
for your baby after their arrival, as well as how to look after you and your
relationship with your partner.

Many maternity hospitals and health centres offer antenatal classes for free,
though you can also register for private classes if you wish. You should book
your preferred classes as early as possible as these can fill up fast.

If you are employed, you may be entitled to take paid time off work to attend
antenatal classes. You should give your employer at least 2 weeks’ notice (in
writing) before the classes begin. See 'Time off work and antenatal classes'
below.

##  COVID-19 and pregnancy

If you are pregnant and think you may have been exposed to COVID-19, contact
your GP. Most women who test positive and have mild symptoms can safely self-
isolate at home (7 days). Routine antenatal or ultrasound appointments should
be postponed until after the period of self-isolation.

Pregnant women who have COVID-19 should only attend the hospital if in need of
urgent medical or obstetric care. It is important to phone the hospital in
advance of coming to make sure you are seen at the right place by the right
medical team.

If you have not had any COVID-19 vaccines, you can get your first round of
COVID-19 vaccination or first booster at any stage of your pregnancy.

If you had a booster dose during your current pregnancy, then a second booster
dose is not needed.

If you had a booster dose before this pregnancy, you can get your second
booster at or after 16 weeks of your pregnancy.

Find more information on getting the [ COVID-19 vaccine during pregnancy
](https://www2.hse.ie/conditions/covid19/people-at-higher-risk/covid19-and-
pregnancy/) , and [ getting the vaccine while trying for a baby or
breastfeeding ](https://www2.hse.ie/screening-and-
vaccinations/covid-19-vaccine/get-the-vaccine/breastfeeding/) on the HSE
website.

If you are unsure about whether to get a vaccination before, during or after
pregnancy, you can [ read the HSE’s information booklet (pdf)
](https://www.hse.ie/eng/health/immunisation/hcpinfo/guidelines/covid19.pdf) .

##  Antenatal classes

Some face-to-face antenatal classes are cancelled because of COVID-19. Some
maternity units are offering online antenatal classes for women booked into
their hospital. Online resources include videos about [ pregnancy, labour and
caring for a newborn ](http://uhk.ie/maternity/) (University Hospital Kerry),
[ online courses ](http://www.nmh.ie/pregnancy/antenatal-education-
preparation.13609.html) (National Maternity Hospital) and [ the Learning Hub
](https://rotunda.ie/pregnancy-journey/) (Rotunda Hospital).

Check with your maternity unit or hospital about any face-to-face and online
resources that are available. Find [ your local maternity unit or hospital
](https://www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/3/maternity/) .

##  Choosing an antenatal class

If you are unsure about which antenatal class to attend, talk to your
maternity hospital, GP, midwife or public health nurse. They can offer you
guidance on what class would suit your specific needs.

Some antenatal classes focus on labour and the birth, while others include a
variety of topics. Some classes are tailored to parents with specific needs,
such as lone parents, teenagers, or parents having twins or multiple births.

If you have previously had a [ caesarean birth
](https://www2.hse.ie/wellbeing/child-health/caesarean-birth/overview-of-
caesarean-birth.html) but now wish to have a vaginal birth, many hospitals and
services offer vaginal birth after caesarean (VBAC) antenatal classes.

**Other topics that may be covered in your antenatal class:**

  * [ Keeping well during pregnancy ](https://www2.hse.ie/wellbeing/pregnancy-and-birth/keeping-well/)
  * [ Emotions ](https://www2.hse.ie/wellbeing/child-health/what-to-expect-in-the-first-trimester.html#3.-Emotional-changes) that you may experience during your pregnancy 
  * What happens during [ labour ](https://www2.hse.ie/labour-and-birth/labour/) and [ birth ](https://www2.hse.ie/labour-and-birth/birth/)
  * [ How to deal with labour ](https://www2.hse.ie/wellbeing/child-health/ways-to-deal-with-labour-pain/ways-to-deal-with-labour-pain.html)
  * [ Positions and breathing for labour and birth ](https://www2.hse.ie/wellbeing/child-health/breathing-and-self-help-techniques-for-labour.html)
  * [ Relaxation techniques ](https://www2.hse.ie/wellbeing/child-health/breathing-and-self-help-techniques-for-labour.html)
  * [ Pain relief ](https://www2.hse.ie/wellbeing/child-health/ways-to-deal-with-labour-pain/ways-to-deal-with-labour-pain.html)
  * Different types of births and interventions 
  * Preparation for becoming a parent 
  * [ Caring for your baby ](https://www2.hse.ie/babies-and-toddlers/everyday-care/)
  * [ Developing a relationship with your baby ](https://www2.hse.ie/wellbeing/child-health/your-babys-mental-health/understanding-your-babys-mental-health.html)
  * [ Looking after your relationship with your partner ](https://www2.hse.ie/wellbeing/child-health/looking-after-your-relationship-as-a-parent.html)
  * [ Safe skin-to-skin contact ](https://www2.hse.ie/wellbeing/child-health/skin-to-skin-contact-with-newborns.html)
  * [ Breastfeeding ](https://www2.hse.ie/babies-and-toddlers/breastfeeding/)
  * Your health after the birth of your baby 
  * Hopes and concerns 

Classes are participant-led, which means that you (and other members of the
class) can have a say in the topics discussed and the pace at which you learn.

**When to start your antenatal classes**

Most formal antenatal classes start when you are between [ 26-32 weeks
pregnant ](https://www2.hse.ie/wellbeing/child-health/25-to-28-weeks-
pregnant.html) .

If you are [ expecting twins ](https://www2.hse.ie/wellbeing/child-
health/expecting-twins-and-multiple-pregnancies.html) (or any multiple
births), consider starting your antenatal classes early. Your babies may
arrive before their due date.

You should book your preferred classes as early as possible. You can [ find
contact information for public hospitals here
](http://www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/3/acutehospitals/hospitals/) .

##  Time off work and antenatal classes

If you are employed, [ you are entitled to take paid time off work to attend
one set of antenatal classes (except for the last 3 classes in a set)
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2004/act/28/enacted/en/html) . For
example, if this is your first pregnancy in employment and you are attending a
set of 8 classes, you are only entitled to be paid while attending 5 of those
classes. The last 3 classes would normally occur after your maternity leave
has started.

You do not have the right to paid time off work to attend antenatal classes
each time you are pregnant and in employment. The entitlement covers one set
of classes (for one pregnancy) only.

However, if you are unable to attend some antenatal classes due to reasons
beyond your control (such as premature birth, illness, miscarriage or
stillbirth), you can carry over your entitlement to your subsequent
pregnancies. This means you can take paid time off work to attend any untaken
classes (except the last 3 in a set).

Expectant fathers have [ a once-off right to paid time off work to attend the
2 antenatal classes immediately prior to the birth
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2004/en/si/0653.html) .

In order to take this paid time off work, you must notify your employer in
writing at least 2 weeks before classes begin. You should outline the dates
and times of the classes, as your employer has the right to request this.

For more information on your entitlement to take paid time off work to attend
antenatal classes (as well as general information on employment rights)
contact the [ Workplace Relations Commission
](https://www.workplacerelations.ie/en/) .  

##  Cost

Antenatal classes held by your local public maternity hospital are free of
charge.

If you choose to attend private antenatal classes, you will be asked to pay a
fee. Remember to always check the credentials of the class provider before
paying.
