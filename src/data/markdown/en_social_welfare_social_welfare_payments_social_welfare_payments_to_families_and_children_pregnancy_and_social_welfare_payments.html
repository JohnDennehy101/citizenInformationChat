#  Pregnancy and social welfare payments

  * Introduction 
  * Pregnancy and jobseeker's payments 
  * Pregnancy and Illness Benefit 
  * Pregnancy and One-Parent Family Payment 
  * Pregnancy and employment schemes 

##  Introduction

If you are pregnant and getting a social welfare payment, you may be able to
continue to get your payment as long as you satisfy the conditions, or
transfer to another payment that better suits your needs.

This page explains how pregnancy is treated if you are getting [ Jobseeker’s
Benefit ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/social-welfare-
payments/unemployed-people/jobseekers-benefit/) , [ Jobseeker’s Allowance
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/social-welfare-
payments/unemployed-people/jobseekers-allowance/) , [ Illness Benefit
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/social-welfare-
payments/disability-and-illness/disability-benefit/) , [ One-Parent Family
Payment ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/social-welfare-
payments/families-and-children/one-parent-family-payment/) or are on an [
employment scheme
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/employment/unemployment-and-
redundancy/employment-support-schemes/schemes-to-support-employment/) .

**Pregnancy and Maternity Benefit**

If you are on [ maternity leave
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/employment/employment-rights-and-
conditions/leave-and-holidays/maternity-leave/) from work and have paid enough
[ social insurance (PRSI) ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-
welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/social-insurance-prsi/social-insurance/) ,
you can get Maternity Benefit. You should apply for [ Maternity Benefit
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/social-welfare-
payments/families-and-children/maternity-benefit/) at least 6 weeks before you
plan to go on maternity leave or 12 weeks if you are self-employed.

If you don’t qualify for Maternity Benefit, you may be able to stay on your
current payment or you may qualify for another payment.

####  Working family payment

If you are on [ maternity leave
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/employment/employment-rights-and-
conditions/leave-and-holidays/maternity-leave/) from work, you may get the
Working Family Payment (WFP) with your Maternity Benefit if you meet the
conditions for the WFP. If you are pregnant and have no other children, you
will not qualify for WFP until your baby is born.

##  Pregnancy and jobseeker's payments

If you are pregnant, and claiming Jobseeker’s Benefit or Jobseeker's
Allowance, you can continue to get your payment. You are considered capable of
work unless you have complications during your pregnancy, or you are ill.

You must be available for and genuinely seeking work to get a jobseeker's
payment. This means that you must continue to look for work throughout your
pregnancy.

You do not have to sign-on at your local Social Welfare or Intreo office 4
weeks before your baby is due to be born and for 8 weeks after the birth. You
also do not have to prove that you are seeking work. You must tell your Intreo
Centre or local Social Welfare Branch Office about your pregnancy.

Your Jobseeker’s Benefit will only be paid for the number of weeks remaining
on your claim. If you no longer qualify for Jobseeker’s Benefit, you can apply
for Jobseeker’s Allowance. The rules for Jobseeker's Allowance are similar to
Jobseeker's Benefit but you will have to pass a means test.

**Increase for a qualified child**

When your baby is born, you may qualify for an increase in your Jobseeker’s
Benefit or Allowance for your child. If you are parenting alone, you may
qualify for the One-Parent Family Payment.

**What if I am unemployed but don't qualify for a jobseeker's payment because
of illness during pregnancy?**

If you are sick or ill during your pregnancy you are not entitled to
Jobseeker's Allowance or Jobseeker's Benefit.

You may get Illness Benefit if you have worked and have enough social
insurance contributions (see below). If you are not entitled to Illness
Benefit and your illness is expected to last for more than 12 months you may
be entitled to [ Disability Allowance
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/social-welfare-
payments/disability-and-illness/disability-allowance/) .

If you are pregnant and either not getting a social welfare payment or not
entitled to any of the above social welfare payments, you may get some
financial support under the [ Supplementary Welfare Allowance Scheme
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/social-welfare-
payments/supplementary-welfare-schemes/supplementary-welfare-allowance-
scheme/) .

##  Pregnancy and Illness Benefit

If you are pregnant and claiming Illness Benefit, you will continue to be paid
Illness Benefit if you have an illness which meets the criteria for the
payment. You cannot use pregnancy itself as a medical reason to claim Illness
Benefit. However, medical complications arising from your pregnancy can
satisfy the medical criteria for Illness Benefit.

You must continue to send in medical certificates to qualify for Illness
Benefit.

When your baby is born you may qualify for an increase in your Illness Benefit
for a child dependant. You should contact the Illness Benefit section to find
out if you qualify.

**Pregnant and on sick leave from work**

If you are on sick leave from work and getting Illness Benefit immediately
before you are due to start your maternity leave, you will transfer from
Illness Benefit to Maternity Benefit when your maternity leave starts, if you
satisfy the social insurance contributions.

The social insurance contributions for Maternity Benefit and Illness Benefit
are not the same. Therefore, if you are in employment but on sick leave and
not getting Illness Benefit, you may still qualify for Maternity Benefit if
you satisfy social insurance contributions.

[ Health and Safety Benefit ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-
welfare/social-welfare-payments/families-and-children/health-safety-benefit/)
is a weekly payment for employed women who are pregnant or breastfeeding, and
who are granted health and safety leave by their employer.

##  Pregnancy and One-Parent Family Payment

If you are pregnant and getting a One-Parent Family Payment, you will continue
to get the payment as long as you satisfy the conditions. When your baby is
born you will qualify for an increase in your payment for a child dependant.
If you are pregnant and do **not** have other children, you are **not**
entitled to One-Parent Family Payment until your baby is born.

You may get half-rate Maternity Benefit with your One-Parent Family Payment if
you meet the conditons for both payments. If you are not entitled to a One-
Parent Family Payment, and you have no other income you may get some financial
support under the [ Supplementary Welfare Allowance Scheme ](/en/social-
welfare/supplementary-welfare-schemes/supplementary-welfare-allowance-scheme/)
.

##  Pregnancy and employment schemes

If you are taking part in an employment scheme you have the full range of
statutory employment rights including [ maternity leave
](/en/employment/employment-rights-and-conditions/leave-and-
holidays/maternity-leave/) .

If you become pregnant while on [ an employment scheme
](/en/employment/unemployment-and-redundancy/employment-support-
schemes/schemes-to-support-employment/) (Community Employment, Rural Social
Scheme, Tús and Gateway schemes) you are entitled to take 26 weeks’ maternity
leave including an additional 16 weeks of optional unpaid leave. If possible,
you will be supported to complete your 52 weeks of paid work on the same or
another project when you finish your maternity leave.

You should discuss with your sponsor the payment you qualify for while you are
on maternity leave. You may qualify for Maternity Benefit if you have enough
PRSI contributions. Otherwise, if your spouse or partner is getting a social
welfare payment, you may get a qualified adult increase on their payment.
