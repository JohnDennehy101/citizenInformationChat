  * How does organ donation work? 
  * Donate my whole body to medical research 
  * Who do I contact about organ donation 

##  What is organ donation?

##  How to become an organ donor?

You can become an organ donor **when you give your consent** by:

  * Carrying a donor card 
  * Noting your consent on your driving license or 
  * Setting up [ the organ donor app ](https://ika.ie/2018/09/digital-organ-donor-card/) on your phone 

You can get an organ donor card from:

  * [ The Irish Kidney Association website ](https://www.ika.ie/get-a-donor-card/)
  * Doctors' surgeries and pharmacies 
  * The Irish Donor Network (see below) 

You should **tell your family or next-of-kin that you consent** to donating
your organs after your death.

Your family or next-of-kin can then tell the doctor or another healthcare
professional in a hospital if they are asked about your organ donation.

###  **Consent and your next-of-kin**

If you gave your consent to donate your organs on an [ organ donor card
](https://www.ika.ie/get-a-donor-card/) , the app or your driving licence,
this will tell the hospital that you are willing to have your organs used for
transplant after you die.

You should tell your next-of-kin that you want to be an organ donor but they
do not have to abide by your wishes, as their consent is always required.

The medical team at the hospital needs your next-of-kin to consent to donating
your organs after you die. If your next-of-kin refuses to donate your organs
the procedure will not go ahead.

##  How does organ donation work?

If you have decided to donate your organs, they will only be removed when 2
doctors, working independently, have certified that you are dead following
many strict tests.

Donating your organs does not change how your body looks or delay your funeral
arrangements.

Sometimes your organs will not be used even if you are an organ donor. There
is medical criteria and other conditions that must be met. For example your
death must take place in a hospital for a safe transplantation to go ahead.
Your body will be maintained on a life support machine (ventilator).

If you have a medical condition this does not necessarily prevent you from
becoming a donor. The final decision will be made by a healthcare professional
at the time of your death.

You can [ read more about the organ donation process on the HSE website
](https://www.hse.ie/eng/about/who/acute-hospitals-division/organ-donation-
transplant-ireland/faqs/) .

###  Post-mortems and organ donation

If your death is reported to the Coroner, they must give their permission
before organ donation can take place, as well as the written consent of your
next-of-kin. Read more about the [ role of the Coroner ](/en/death/sudden-or-
unexplained-death/coroners/) and [ post-mortems ](/en/death/sudden-or-
unexplained-death/postmortems/) .

If you donated your organs for transplantation, this will happen in an
operating theatre, as this is not a post-mortem practice.

If you donated your organs for research, this will happen in a mortuary as it
is a post-mortem procedure.

When commenced, the [ Human Tissue Bill 2022
](https://www.oireachtas.ie/en/bills/bill/2022/121/) will make changes to
current post-mortem practice and procedure. It will require additional
communication and information sharing with families when a post-mortem by a
coroner is needed.

It will also introduce a consent framework for how consent should be obtained
from families for post-mortems that are not carried out by the coroner.

##  Donate my whole body to medical research

You can donate your whole body for medical research to help health workers to
learn more about anatomy, research and treating illness.

If you want to donate your body for medical research, you should contact one
of the medical research schools located in the colleges listed below. Each
medical school has its own procedures for entering into an agreement with you:

  * [ University College Dublin ](http://www.ucd.ie/medicine/bodydonation/)
  * [ Trinity College Dublin ](https://www.tcd.ie/medicine/anatomy/donation-of-remains/)
  * [ The Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland ](http://www.rcsi.ie/anatomy-donations-of-remains)
  * [ University College Cork ](https://www.ucc.ie/en/anatomy/uccanatomicaldonations/)
  * [ National University of Ireland, Galway ](http://www.nuigalway.ie/anatomy/donorprogramme/#)

You should also make sure that your next-of-kin know that you want to donate
your whole body to medical research by:

  * Telling them and/or 
  * Stating that you wish to donate your body for medical research in your [ will ](/en/death/before-a-death/making-a-will/) . 

The law is unclear on this but it would seem that your next-of-kin, or whoever
is responsible for the cremation or interment of your body, are not
necessarily obliged to go along with your wishes.

When the [ Human Tissue Bill 2022
](https://www.oireachtas.ie/en/bills/bill/2022/121/) is implemented, it will
set standards and arrangements for donating your body to an anatomy school.  

##  Who do I contact about organ donation
