##  Senior Cycle programme

After completing the [ Junior Cycle ](/en/education/primary-and-post-primary-
education/going-to-post-primary-school/junior-cycle/) students begin the
Senior Cycle programme. The Senior Cycle generally caters for students from 15
to 18 although the Leaving Certificate is not limited to second-level
students. The main programmes that students can follow at Senior Cycle are:

  * [ The Transition Year ](/en/education/primary-and-post-primary-education/going-to-post-primary-school/transition-year/)
  * [ The Established Leaving Certificate ](/en/education/state-examinations/leaving-certificate/)
  * [ The Leaving Certificate Applied ](/en/education/state-examinations/leaving-certificate-applied/)
  * [ The Leaving Certificate Vocational Programme. ](/en/education/state-examinations/leaving-certificate-vocational-programme/)

Not all of these programmes are followed in every school. You must find out
what is available in your school or the school you are thinking of attending.

###  Senior Cycle and Leaving Certificate reform

The Department of Education plans to reform the Senior Cycle and Leaving
Certificate and set up the [ Senior Cycle Redevelopment Programme Delivery
Board ](https://www.gov.ie/en/press-release/a727e-minister-foley-announces-
the-establishment-of-the-senior-cycle-redevelopment-programme-delivery-board-
and-deferral-of-planned-move-of-paper-one-in-leaving-certificate-english-and-
irish-examinations/) to oversee this work.

does-this-mean-for-me/) .

##  Compulsory subjects

Within these programmes, there are a number of compulsory subjects. The
subjects that are compulsory vary for different programmes and different types
of school. All third-level courses have [ minimum subject requirements for
entry ](/en/education/third-level-education/applying-to-college/application-
procedures-and-entry-requirements/) . These often include Maths, English and
Irish. You should check these minimum requirements before deciding which
subjects to take for the Leaving Certificate.

Irish is compulsory in most programmes. [ In some very limited circumstances,
a student may not have to study Irish ](/en/education/the-irish-education-
system/exemption-from-irish/) .
