#  Legal matters and health

  * [ Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 ](/en/health/legal-matters-and-health/assisted-decision-making-act/)

The Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 is a law that establishes a
new legal framework for supported decision-making in Ireland. It has applied
since 26 April 2023.

  * [ Types of decision support arrangements ](/en/health/legal-matters-and-health/decision-support-arrangements/)

Decision support arrangements are available to give the legal authority to
someone to help you make decisions or make decisions on your behalf.

  * [ Decision-making assistance agreement ](/en/health/legal-matters-and-health/decision-making-assistance-agreement/)

If you have difficulty making certain decisions on your own without help or
think you may soon have a difficulty, you can make a decision-making
assistance agreement and choose a person you trust to be your decision-making
assistant.

  * [ Co-decision-making agreement ](/en/health/legal-matters-and-health/co-decision-making-agreement/)

A co-decision making agreement gives a person the legal authority to make
certain decisions with you.

  * [ Decision-making representation order ](/en/health/legal-matters-and-health/decision-making-representative-order/)

If you are unable to make certain decisions, the court can give you a
decision-making representative to make those decisions on your behalf.

  * [ Ward of court ](/en/health/legal-matters-and-health/wards-of-court/)

No new wards of court can be created from 26 April 2023. Over the following 3
years, existing wards will be reviewed.

  * [ Advance Healthcare Directives ](/en/health/legal-matters-and-health/advance-care-directives/)

An Advance Healthcare Directive in Ireland is a statement about the type and
extent of medical or surgical treatment you want in the future, on the
assumption that you will not be able to make that decision at the relevant
time.

  * [ Consent to medical and surgical procedures ](/en/health/legal-matters-and-health/consent-to-medical-and-surgical-procedures/)

As a general rule, informed consent must be given before medical and surgical
procedures can happen in Ireland. Find out more.

  * [ Agency agreements, trusts, and ordinary powers of attorney ](/en/health/legal-matters-and-health/legal-arrangements-for-incapacity/)

If you need someone to act on your behalf, this page explains some of the
arrangements available.

  * [ Access to medical records ](/en/health/legal-matters-and-health/access-to-medical-records/)

There are many ways you can access personal medical records. Find out how.

  * [ Enduring power of attorney ](/en/death/before-a-death/power-of-attorney/)

Power of attorney is a legal device in Ireland that can be set up by a person
(the Donor) to allow another specially appointed person (the Attorney) to act
on their behalf. An enduring power of attorney only takes effect when the
donor becomes mentally incapacitated and no longer able to manage their own
affairs.
