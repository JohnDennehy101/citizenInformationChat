##  Introduction

There are different types of loans for different circumstances. It is
important to get the right loan for your needs. Loans are also known as
credit.

When choosing a loan, you should take into account the:

  * Amount 
  * Cost 
  * Time for repayment (also known as the term) 

Some loans are for specific purposes, for example, a mortgage for a house,
hire purchase for a car or in-store credit for other purchases. Some types of
credit are more flexible, for example, an overdraft or credit card.

There can be a very big difference in the cost of different types of loans.
When you decide which type is best for your needs, you can save money by
shopping around with different providers.

Generally, banks, building societies and other credit institutions charge for
the use of borrowed money. This payment is called [ interest ](/en/money-and-
tax/personal-finance/savings-and-investments/interest-on-loans-and-savings/)
and it is calculated on the amount of money you borrow and the length of time
that you borrow it. You may also have to pay fees to cover administrative
expenses on your loan.

If you have [ difficulty paying off a loan ](/en/money-and-tax/personal-
finance/debt/dealing-with-debt/) the Money Advice and Budgeting Service ( [
MABS ](/en/money-and-tax/personal-finance/debt/mabs-service/) ) may be able to
help.

##  Before you borrow

If you are borrowing money, check to make sure that you can afford to pay back
the loan. Make sure that any money you have left after you pay for essential
living costs is enough to cover the repayments. If you can save enough money
to buy what you need, or to pay for part of the cost, it will be cheaper than
getting a loan to buy it.

**Get a loan to suit your needs**

There are many different types of loans or credit. Each type of credit is
suitable for a different purpose. Some are more suited to short-term borrowing
and others are more suited to borrowing for longer.

**Shop around for the best value**

When looking for a loan, it is worth shopping around for the best value. To
compare charges, interest on loans must be shown as the **Annual Percentage
Rate (APR)** . The APR shows what percentage of the amount you borrow will be
charged in addition to paying back the amount you borrowed.

It is important to compare like with like. Loans can be paid back over
different terms or lengths of time. You may think that you are getting a good
deal on a loan with a low APR but if you are paying more instalments over a
longer period of time you may find that it will cost you more.

If you are comparing loans that are for different lengths of time, you should
instead compare the cost of credit.

The **cost of credit** looks at the total cost of the loan. It is the
difference between the amount you borrow and the total you repay.

The Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC) has a [ loan
comparison tool ](https://www.ccpc.ie/consumers/money-tools/loan-comparison/)
that shows you the APR, monthly repayments and overall cost of credit for
personal loans that are currently available.

**Make sure you are dealing with an authorised lender**

The Central Bank authorises banks, building societies credit unions and
moneylenders. You should only borrow from an authorised lender. This protects
you and your money from predatory lenders or bogus websites. The Central Bank
has an [ explainer on why it is important to deal with an authorised company
and how to check if a company is authorised
](https://www.centralbank.ie/consumer-hub/explainers/why-is-it-important-to-
deal-with-an-authorised-financial-service-provider) .

##  Your credit history

If you have ever used credit, you have a credit history. This is information
about loans you have had and your repayment history. A credit institution can
refuse to give you a loan if you have not complied with the terms and
conditions of previous loans. The Central Credit Register provides credit
reports to borrowers and lenders. It is operated by the Central Bank of
Ireland. [ Read more about credit reports and your credit history ](/en/money-
and-tax/personal-finance/loans-and-credit/your-credit-history/) .

##  Overdrafts

An [ overdraft ](/en/money-and-tax/personal-finance/loans-and-
credit/overdrafts/) is a way of borrowing on your bank account. Overdrafts are
given on your current account so that, when your account balance is zero, you
can still spend up to an agreed limit. Overdrafts usually have a higher
interest rate than personal loans but are flexible and can be useful for
short-term credit and relatively small amounts.

##  Credit cards

A [ credit card ](https://www.ccpc.ie/consumers/money/credit-cards) allows you
to borrow a limited amount to pay for goods and services. There is no interest
charged on borrowings if you pay your full bill within a set number of days.

Credit cards are flexible and can be used to pay for items and services that
you may buy online or by phone. Credit cards are accepted to pay for goods and
services or to get cash.

They are not suitable for long-term borrowing because the interest rates are
high.

The CCPC has a [ credit card comparison tool
](https://www.ccpc.ie/consumers/money-tools/credit-card-comparisons/) that
shows the interest rates charged for different credit cards that are
available.

##  Personal loans from banks

Banks offer [ personal loans
](https://www.ccpc.ie/consumers/money/loans/personal-loans/) to customers.
These loans are suitable for medium and longer-term needs, for example, a car
loan or a loan for home improvements. Banks may also charge other fees.
Generally, you pay a fixed amount back every month.

If your loan is a variable rate loan you may be able to pay more back when you
have it, so that you can pay off the loan sooner.

It is not advisable to take out personal loans to cover day-to-day expenses.

##  Credit union loans

[ Credit unions ](/en/money-and-tax/personal-finance/banking/credit-unions/)
also offer loans to consumers. You must be a member of a credit union before
you can take out a loan. Credit unions are based in the community or workplace
and you must be living or working in a particular area or working for a
particular employer to become a member. You may need to have saved some money
in a credit union before getting a loan.

Credit union loans are suitable for short or longer-term needs such as loans
for holidays or cars. They are also useful for refinancing other loans.

Some credit unions offer the [ It Makes Sense loan ](/en/money-and-
tax/personal-finance/loans-and-credit/microcredit-loans/) . This loan is aimed
at people getting social welfare payments who repay the loan through the
Household Budget Scheme. It offers loans of small amounts at low interest
rates.

##  Hire purchase

This is a hire agreement offered by shops so that you can hire and eventually
buy particular items. Items bought on hire purchase are normally expensive
items such as a car or furniture or electronic equipment. In a [ hire purchase
agreement ](/en/money-and-tax/personal-finance/loans-and-credit/hire-
purchase/) , you become the owner of the item when the last instalment is
paid.

##  Personal Contract Plans (PCPs)

This is a type of hire purchase agreement offered by car dealers as a way to
pay for a car. In a PCP contract, you pay a deposit and continue to make
regular instalments, usually over 3 years. There is usually a large lump sum
payment at the end of the contract.

At the end of the contract you can either:

  * Pay the final lump sum and keep the car or 
  * Return the car to the seller 

You do not own the car until the final payment is made. If you return the car,
you can take out a new PCP on another car.

There may be rules about using the car, such as mileage limits and
requirements to service the car.

PCPs can seem very attractive because they usually have very low monthly
repayments but they can be complex compared to other types of car finance. It
is important to understand all the terms and conditions before you sign up for
a PCP. You can [ find out more about PCPs from the CCPC
](https://www.ccpc.ie/consumers/money/loans/paying-for-your-car/pcp/) .

##  In-store credit

Some shops offer the option to buy an item and pay for it in instalments. This
is sometimes called Buy Now Pay Later.

This may be provided by a different business that is the credit provider.

You enter into an agreement to repay the credit provider. It is important to
check the terms and conditions of the agreement, including the fees and
charges such as interest or late payment fees. The CCPC has further
information on [ Buy Now Pay Later
](https://www.ccpc.ie/consumers/money/loans/buy-now-pay-later/) .

##  Mortgages and top-up mortgages

A [ mortgage ](/en/housing/owning-a-home/help-with-buying-a-home/taking-out-a-
mortgage/) is a long-term loan to finance a property purchase and is usually
secured on your home. A top-up mortgage is a way of extending your mortgage to
[ consolidate your debts
](https://www.ccpc.ie/consumers/money/loans/consolidating-debts/) or to pay
for a car or other large purchase.

Although APRs are low, this type of loan may cost you a lot more in the long
run if you pay it back over a longer term. Both mortgages and top-up mortgages
are secured on your home so it is very important that you keep up repayments
as otherwise your home may be at risk.

The CCPC has a [ mortgage comparison tool
](https://www.ccpc.ie/consumers/money-tools/mortgage-comparisons/) that shows
the interest rate, monthly repayments and total amount to repay for different
mortgages that are available.

##  Moneylender loans

Moneylenders usually lend smaller amounts at a high interest rate for a short
time. Banks, building societies, insurance companies and credit unions are not
considered moneylenders.

Some shops may be registered as moneylenders if they offer credit at an
interest rate of 23%APR or higher.

You should always make sure that your moneylender is regulated. Check the
Central Bank’s [ Register of Authorised Firms
](http://registers.centralbank.ie) . [ Read more about moneylenders
](/en/money-and-tax/personal-finance/loans-and-credit/moneylending-in-
ireland/) .

##  Credit and your consumer rights

The rules that apply to credit agreements are set out in consumer credit
legislation - the [ Consumer Credit Act 1995
](https://revisedacts.lawreform.ie/eli/1995/act/24/revised/en/html) and the [
European Communities (Consumer Credit Agreements) Regulations 2010
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2010/si/281/made/en/print) .

Lenders regulated by the Central Bank must comply with the [ Consumer
Protection Code 2012 ](https://www.centralbank.ie/regulation/consumer-
protection/consumer-protection-codes-regulations#unofficial-consolidation) .
There are also [ specific rules for moneylenders
](https://www.centralbank.ie/regulation/industry-market-
sectors/moneylenders/regulatory-requirements-and-guidance) .

Consumer credit legislation and codes contain specific rules that apply [ when
lenders advertise ](/en/money-and-tax/personal-finance/loans-and-
credit/credit-advertising/) and sell loans. For example, lenders must carry
out tests to check whether you can afford the repayments before giving you a
loan or mortgage. Lenders must not offer you a pre-approved loan or mortgage
that you have not asked for. Lenders must not increase your credit card limit,
unless you ask them to.

A lender cannot phone you about your loan without your agreement between 9 pm
and 9 am, Monday to Saturday, or at any time on a Sunday or public holiday.
They can only visit you in person if you have agreed to the visit.

The lender is not allowed to call you or to visit you at your place of work
unless you are also living there, or unless all efforts to contact you
elsewhere have failed. Only the person involved in the loan can be contacted
about it. This means that your lender cannot contact your employer or a member
of your family about your loan.
