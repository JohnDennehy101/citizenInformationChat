#  Complain about advertising

  * Introduction 
  * Complaint to the Advertising Standards Authority 
  * Other organisations you can complain to 
  * More information 

##  Introduction

There are laws to protect you from [ misleading advertising
](/en/consumer/advertising-and-promotions/advertising/) . Businesses must not
make statements in advertising that are incorrect or likely to create a false
impression.

You can complain if you feel a business has misled you about a product or
service or you object to the content in an advert.

The Advertising Standards Authority is the main body for enforcing rules
around advertising but there are other bodies who set standards for different
sectors.

##  Complaint to the Advertising Standards Authority

The Advertising Standards Authority is an independent self-regulatory body set
up and financed by the advertising industry.

It has a role to promote high standards of advertising and sales promotion. It
publishes a [ Code of Standards for Advertising and Marketing Communications
(the Code) ](https://adstandards.ie/asa-code/) .

###  What you can complain about

You can complain to the Advertising Standards Authority about:

  * Misleading or false advertising 
  * Content in an advert that you object to 

The Advertising Standards Authority will consider complaints about the content
of a _commercial marketing communication_ . A commercial marketing
communication includes content in an ad, promotion, or direct mail shown:

  * On TV or radio 
  * Online 
  * On posters 
  * In brochures 
  * In newspapers and magazines 
  * In emails and direct mailings 
  * In cinemas 
  * In promotional sales materials 

There is no charge to make a complaint and your identity is kept confidential.

###  How to complain

Send your complaint to the Advertising Standards Authority by letter or using
the [ online complaint form ](https://www.asai.ie/make-a-complaint/make-a-
complaint/) .

Make sure to include:

  * Your full name and address 
  * A screen shot of the ad (if online) 
  * A copy of the ad if possible (for example, a press or magazine clipping) 
  * When and where it appeared 
  * The name of the advertiser 
  * In the case of sales promotions, the name of the product and the promoter and copies of labels, leaflets or entry forms 
  * Reasons why you think the ad is wrong 
  * Whether you are objecting as an individual consumer or as a competitor 

###  Advertising Standards Authority investigation

The Advertising Standards Authority will review your complaint to check if it
is an issue that is under its remit and if an investigation is needed.

The Advertising Standards Authority will tell you if your complaint does not
fall under its remit, or it decides an investigation is not appropriate (and
the reason). The Advertising Standards Authority can refer you to another
organisation for help.

If the Advertising Standards Authority decides to investigate your complaint,
it will tell the advertiser (or the agency involved). The advertiser has 10
days to respond to the Advertising Standards Authority and comment on the
investigation.

When the Advertising Standards Authority gets a response, a summary of the
case and the Advertising Standards Authority’s recommendation is sent to the
Complaints Committee. The Advertising Standards Authority sends a copy of this
recommendation to you and the other party. You can give more information or
comments before the Complaints Committee decide on whether or not the advert
has breached the code rules.

###  Advertising Standards Authority **decision**

The Complaints Committee prepare a Case Report, which includes details of the
case and the Committee’s final decision. The Case Report is given to you and
the other party and is also [ published on the Advertising Standards Authority
website ](https://adstandards.ie/complaints-decisions/) . Your name is not
published.

When an ad or promotion has breached the Code, it must be withdrawn from
public view or quickly amended according to the Committee’s instructions.

If the breach is very serious, the investigation procedure can be fast-
tracked. The Advertising Standards Authority may also request the advertiser
or agency to take urgent action, for example to immediately withdraw or amend
the ad while the investigation is being completed.

##  Other organisations you can complain to

The Advertising Standards Authority is the main body for enforcing rules
around advertising but there are other bodies who also set standards and
monitor.

###  Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC)

If you feel that an ad is misleading or false, you can report it to the CCPC.

The CCPC is responsible for enforcing the rules around business advertising in
Ireland and can take action, where appropriate.

The CCPC cannot get compensation for you where you have made a bad buying
decision because of misleading advertising. You may have a case against the
advertiser using the Small Claims Court.

The CCPC has more information about [ misleading advertising
](https://www.ccpc.ie/consumers/shopping/misleading-advertising/) .

###  **Coimisiún na Meán**

In March 2023, Coimisiún na Meán replaced the Broadcasting Authority of
Ireland (BAI) as the regulator for commercial and public service broadcasting.
Broadcasters must follow [ the BAI Code ](https://www.bai.ie/en/codes-
standards/#al-block-7) (until a new code is developed)  

If you have a complaint about advertising, sponsorship, teleshopping or
product placement on tv or radio in Ireland, you must make your complaint to
the broadcaster first. If you are not happy with the response from the
broadcaster, you can complain to the Coimisiún na Meán. You can get more
information about [ making a complaint ](https://www.bai.ie/en/viewers-
listeners/complaints/) .

###  The Food Safety Authority of Ireland (FSAI)

The FSAI is responsible for the advertisement of food products. You can
contact the FSAI if you have a complaint about misleading information on food
products that affects, or is likely to affect, your buying decision.

The FSAI and ASAI have [ guidance
](https://www.fsai.ie/news_centre/press_releases/advertising_code_marketing_terms_30112016.html)
about marketing terms to describe food (for example use of the terms artisan
or artisanal, farmhouse, traditional or natural). There are also EU rules
about using the word ‘organic’ in food labeling.

You can complain to the FSAI using the online complaint form. The FSAI has
more information about [ making a complaint about food products
](https://www.fsai.ie/consumer-advice/making-complaints) .

###  The Central Bank of Ireland

You can complain to the Central Bank if you feel an ad for a financial product
or service is misleading. Rules on advertisements for financial products are
in the [ Consumer Protection Code
](https://www.centralbank.ie/regulation/consumer-protection/consumer-
protection-codes-regulations#consumer-protection-code-2012) and the [
Moneylending Regulations
](https://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2020/si/196/made/en/print) . You can
find out more about the [ advertising of credit
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/money-and-tax/personal-finance/loans-
and-credit/credit-advertising/) and [ complaining about financial services
