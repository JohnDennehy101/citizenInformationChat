##  What is assistive technology?

Assistive technology helps students with a disability who have difficulty
communicating through speech and writing to fully participate in education.

Some examples of assistive technology include laptops or tablets with modified
software, joysticks, keyboards, touch pads, tapes, braille equipment and
audiology equipment.

Schools can get an Assistive Technology Grant from the Department of Education
to buy computers and specialist equipment for students with a disability.

##  Help to buy assistive technology

Schools can get an Assistive Technology Grant from the Department of Education

To get a grant, a student must have a physical disability or a general
learning disability that makes ordinary communication through speech and
writing impossible.

The assistive technology grant is for equipment that is essential for the
student to access the school curriculum.

Some examples of assistive technology used include laptop or tablet computers
with modified software, joysticks, keyboards, touch pads, tapes, braille
equipment and audiology equipment.

Not covered by the grant are telephones, smart phones, iphones, ipods,
televisions, plasma screen TV’s, internet access or phone connectivity
charges.

Schools must wait for approval before buying equipment. When the equipment has
been bought, the school should send the full receipts and invoices with claims
for payment. Copies of these should be kept in the school accounts.
Applications can also be made for approved equipment repair.  

##  Can I take my assistive technology home from school?

Usually the equipment provided under the grant is kept in the school. However,
the Board of Management can give permission for a student to use the equipment
at home.

The equipment remains the property of the school and will usually be passed on
to another student or to another school, when the school no longer needs it.

The Board of Management of the school is responsible for insurance,
maintenance, repair and service charges. One teacher should be given the
responsibility for managing the equipment and making sure that it is used
effectively in the school.

##  What amount can I get with the Assistive Technology Grant?

The rate of the grant will be the cost of the equipment. There is no upper
limit.

##  How to apply for the Assistive Technology Grant

Your school should apply for special equipment to the [ Special Needs
Education Organiser (SENO) ](https://ncse.ie/seno-contact-information) with
responsibility for that school. The SENO will apply to the Department of
Education for the Assistive Technology Grant. Medical reports and assessments
may be required.

You will find a [ contact list of SENOs ](https://ncse.ie/for-parents/ncse-
school-information-map) and [ an application form ](http://ncse.ie/wp-
content/uploads/2015/02/NCSE-Application-Form-3-Application-for-Assistive-
Technology.final_.23.02.15.doc) on the website of the National Council for
Special Education.

Applications for students with visual or hearing impairment should be made to
the [ Visiting Teacher Service for Children with Sensory Impairment
](https://ncse.ie/visiting-teachers) . The Visiting Teacher Service will then
advise the SENO.

You can get more information on ICT for [ Special Education Needs on the
National Centre for Technology in Education (NCTE)
](https://www.sess.ie/links/sen-ict-and-assistive-technology) website and the
[ National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS).

##  How to appeal if you are refused the Assistive Technology Grant

A school can appeal the decision where:

  * Assistive technology has not been granted, or 
  * Assistive technology has been granted but the school wants to appeal the amount of the grant, or the specific equipment provided. 

A school must complete and submit the [ appeal form
](https://www.gov.ie/pdf/38628/?page=1) .

When submitting the [ appeal form ](https://www.gov.ie/pdf/38628/?page=1) the
school should not re-submit the original application or professional reports
supplied to the SENO.

If there are new or updated reports – different to the original application –
then these can be submitted to the SENO in support of a new application.
