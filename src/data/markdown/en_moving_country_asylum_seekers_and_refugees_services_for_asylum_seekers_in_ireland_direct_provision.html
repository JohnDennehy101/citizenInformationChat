##  What is direct provision?

Direct provision is the name used to describe the accommodation, food, money
and medical services you get while your [ international protection application
](/en/moving-country/asylum-seekers-and-refugees/the-asylum-process-in-
ireland/applying-for-refugee-status-in-ireland/) is being assessed or while
you are an asylum seeker, which means the same thing.

You might get direct provision if you have applied for international
protection and are waiting for:

  * Your first decision 
  * The [ result of an appeal ](/en/moving-country/asylum-seekers-and-refugees/the-asylum-process-in-ireland/if-your-application-for-refugee-status-is-refused/) to the International Protection Appeals Tribunal 
  * A [ judicial review ](/en/government-in-ireland/how-government-works/standards-and-accountability/judicial-review-public-decisions/) (where the High Court looks at how a decision on your application was made) 
  * A decision on whether you will be given leave to remain 
  * A deportation 

You do not have to accept direct provision. If you decide to live somewhere
else, you will not get any state assistance (for example, social welfare or
help with housing costs).

Your direct provision normally ends if the Department of Justice gives you a [
refugee ](/en/moving-country/asylum-seekers-and-refugees/the-asylum-process-
in-ireland/refugees-asylum-seekers-introduction#lad40a) , or [ subsidiary
protection ](/en/moving-country/asylum-seekers-and-refugees/the-asylum-
process-in-ireland/refugees-asylum-seekers-introduction#l50016) declaration or
[ permission to remain ](/en/moving-country/asylum-seekers-and-
refugees/refugee-status-and-leave-to-remain/permission-to-remain/) , but
sometimes you can stay in direct provision temporarily while you are looking
for your own place to live.

You can read about what happens if you are a [ Ukrainian refugee with
temporary protection ](/en/moving-country/asylum-seekers-and-refugees/the-
asylum-process-in-ireland/coming-to-ireland-from-ukraine/) .

##  What will I get in direct provision?

When you [ apply for international protection ](/en/moving-country/asylum-
seekers-and-refugees/the-asylum-process-in-ireland/applying-for-refugee-
status-in-ireland/) , also called _claiming asylum_ , the International
Protection Office (IPO) must process your application. This sometimes takes a
long time.

While you are waiting, you can get direct provision. This means that you get:

  * Somewhere to live 
  * Meals 
  * A Daily Expenses Allowance (DEA) – see ‘Social welfare payments’ below 
  * A [ medical card ](/en/health/medical-cards-and-gp-visit-cards/medical-card/)

Since January 2023, applicants for international protection who do not have
children are not prioritised for accommodation. You can read more about [ how
international protection applicants are prioritised for accommodation
](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/e202e-statistics-on-international-
protection-applicants-not-offered-accommodation/) .

When you apply for international protection, you will give your contact
details. When accommodation is available, IPAS will contact you.

If IPAS is unable to provide you with accommodation, you will get a temporary
increase of your Daily Expense Allowance (DEA).

The Irish Refugee Council has useful information on [ supports for homeless
international protection applicants.

protection-applicants)

##  How direct provision works

###  Accommodation and food

The place where you live in direct provision, called an accommodation centre,
is usually a hotel or hostel that is paid to provide accommodation to
international protection applicants. While you are in direct provision, you
get breakfast, lunch and an evening meal.

The [ International Protection Accommodation Service (IPAS)
](https://www.gov.ie/en/campaigns/d9f43-international-protection-
accommodation-services-ipas/) is the state agency that looks after the direct
provision system.

Applicants for international protection who do not have children are not
prioritised for accommodation. You can read more about [ how international
protection applicants are prioritised for accommodation
](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/e202e-statistics-on-international-
protection-applicants-not-offered-accommodation/) . When you apply for
international protection, you will give your contact details. When
accommodation is available, IPAS will contact you.

###  Social welfare payments

You get a weekly social welfare payment, called a [ Daily Expenses Allowance
](https://www.gov.ie/en/service/ba5ad9-daily-expenses-allowance/) (DEA), while
you are in direct provision. To get a DEA, your income must be under a certain
amount – see ‘DEA income test’ below.

**DEA rates in 2024:**

  * €38.80 for each adult 
  * €29.80 for each child 

If IPAS is unable to provide you with accommodation, you will get a temporary
increase of €75 in your Daily Expense Allowance (DEA). This means your DEA
will increase from €38.80 a week to €113.80 a week.

Find out [ how to apply for a Daily Expenses Allowance
](https://www.gov.ie/en/service/ba5ad9-daily-expenses-allowance/#apply) .

####  DEA income test

From June 2024, the Department of Social Protection (DSP) will check that you
continue to qualify for DEA, if you are:

  * Age 18 or over **and**
  * Getting an income for 12 weeks or more 

Income includes pay from a job, self-employment and social welfare payments.

How your income can affect your DEA payment:

**Your weekly income** |  **Daily Expenses Allowance (DEA)**  
---|---  
€60 or less  |  No change to DEA   
€61 - €124  |  [ Reduced rate of DEA ](https://www.gov.ie/en/service/ba5ad9-daily-expenses-allowance/#income-assessment)  
€125 or more  |  DEA payment will stop   
  
If your DEA is reduced or stopped, it will not affect the DEA payment to your
other family members.

If you are getting a DEA and have additional income, you should email
NWCWS@welfare.ie.

####  Moving your DEA payment to new accommodation

If you are moved to new IPAS accommodation, you can get your DEA transferred
to [ your nearest Post Office ](https://www.anpost.com/Store-Locator) . To
transfer your DEA, contact the Community Welfare Services national phone line
on 0818 60 70 80.

####  Other social welfare payments

You cannot get other social welfare payments such as [ Disability Allowance
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/disability-and-
illness/disability-allowance/) , [ One-Parent Family Payment
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/families-and-
children/one-parent-family-payment/) and [ Jobseeker’s Allowance
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/unemployed-
people/jobseekers-allowance/) . However, if you have permission to work and
are in employment, you may qualify for [ Working Family Payment.
](https://www.gov.ie/en/service/08bb21-working-family-payment/)

You can apply for an [ Additional Needs Payment
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/supplementary-welfare-
schemes/additional-needs-payment/) if you have essential needs that you cannot
pay for from your weekly payment. For example, you might get some help to buy
school uniforms for your children.

###  Healthcare

While you are in direct provision, you can get a [ medical card
](/en/health/medical-cards-and-gp-visit-cards/medical-card/) . This gives you
and your family free doctor (GP) appointments, free hospital care in public
hospitals and prescriptions for a low cost.

###  Can I work?

You are not allowed to work until you have been waiting for 6 months for the
IPO to issue its first decision (called the ‘first instance recommendation’)
on your application.

You can [ make an application for Labour Market Access Permission
](https://www.irishimmigration.ie/my-situation-has-changed-since-i-arrived-in-
ireland/labour-market-access-permission/) if:

  * You have been waiting for at least 5 months for a decision on your application and 
  * You have co-operated in the application process 

If you get permission to work, it is valid from when you have been waiting for
a decision on your IPO application for 6 months.

To apply for permission to work, you:

  * Fill in a [ Form LMA3 ](https://www.irishimmigration.ie/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/LMA3-September-2022.pdf) (if you are not sure how to fill this in, you can visit your [ local Citizens Information Centre ](https://centres.citizensinformation.ie/) ) and send it to Immigration Services Delivery (see ‘Further information and contacts’ below) 

You can also apply for permission to be self-employed if you want to work for
yourself.

If your application is successful, Immigration Services Delivery will send you
a letter giving you permission to work.

When you find a job, your employer (or you if you are self-employed) should
send [ Form LMA5 ](https://www.irishimmigration.ie/wp-
content/uploads/2021/10/form-LMA5.pdf) to the Immigration Services Division.

You should apply to renew your permission to work one month before it expires
using [ Form LMA4 ](https://www.irishimmigration.ie/wp-
content/uploads/2022/09/LMA4-September-2022.pdf) .

###  Education

[ Primary ](/en/education/primary-and-post-primary-education/going-to-primary-
school/starting-primary-school/) and [ secondary school
](/en/education/primary-and-post-primary-education/going-to-post-primary-
school/starting-post-primary-school/) is free in Ireland. Your children must
go to school until they are at least 16.

####  SUSI grant

You (or your child or children) can apply for the [ International Protection
Student Scheme ](https://www.gov.ie/en/service/e786a-student-support-scheme-
for-asylum-seekers/) for help with the cost of going to third level education
(including post-graduate courses). You can qualify for this if you:

  * Are an international protection applicant and have not received a final decision on your application for refugee, subsidiary protection or permission to remain 
  * Have been an international protection applicant for at least 3 years on the date before your course starts 
  * Have not been given a deportation order 
  * Have applied for an approved PLC or higher education course 
  * Have income below the income limits for the scheme (income of parents is assessed unless you are an independent mature student) 

To apply, you fill in an [ application form
](https://www.gov.ie/en/service/e786a-student-support-scheme-for-asylum-
seekers/#scheme-information-and-forms) .

####  Post-Leaving Cert courses (PLC)

If you have permission to work, you do not have to pay international fees to
do a [ PLC course ](/en/education/further-education-and-training/post-leaving-
certificate-courses/) .

####  English language courses

You may have free access to adult literacy and English language classes. You
can get information on English classes from your local Education and Training
Board (ETB).

##  Rules in direct provision

You should tell the accommodation centre manager if you or your family are
away overnight. If you are away from the accommodation centre for more than 3
consecutive nights, the accommodation centre manager will write to you to ask
you for the reason why you were away.

You could lose your accommodation if your explanation is not accepted. You
could also lose your Daily Expenses Allowance.

If you move out of your accommodation centre, you should write to tell the
International Protection Office where you are staying.

##  Complaints about direct provision

You should first make your complaint to the manager of the reception centre
where you are living. You should talk to the manager first to see if they can
resolve your complaint. You can make a complaint in writing if you are not
satisfied.

If you are not happy with the outcome of your complaint to the reception
centre, [ you can complain
](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/e0f1a-international-protection-
accommodation-service-ipas-complaints-procedure/) to the International
Protection Accommodation Service (IPAS).

You can contact the [ Office of the Ombudsman
](https://www.ombudsman.ie/publications/information-leaflets/the-ombudsman-
and-direct/) if you are still not satisfied. The Ombudsman cannot investigate
decisions about your international protection application. You should send
your complaint within 12 months of the action or decision that you want to
complain about. Even if more than 12 months has passed, the Ombudsman may
still be able to help if there is a good reason for the delay.

If the complaint relates to a child, you should complain to the [ Ombudsman
for Children’s Office (OCO) ](https://www.oco.ie/complaints/) .

##  A new system to replace direct provision

The Irish Government plans to replace direct provision with a new [
International Protection Support Service
](https://www.gov.ie/en/campaigns/60714-international-protection-support-
service/) .

Under the plan, applicants for international protection will stay in a
‘reception and integration centre’ for no more than 4 months and all current
direct provision centres will close by the end of 2024.

You can read more about the plans in the [ White Paper on Ending Direct
Provision ](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/7aad0-minister-ogorman-
publishes-the-white-paper-on-ending-direct-provision/) .
