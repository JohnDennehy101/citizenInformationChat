#  Schemes for houses affected by pyrite or mica

  * What are mica and pyrite? 
  * What is the Enhanced Defective Concrete Blocks Grant Scheme? 
  * What is the Defective Concrete Products Levy? 
  * What is the Pyrite Remediation Scheme? 

##  What are mica and pyrite?

Mica and pyrite are minerals found in the ground and in rocks that are
excavated from quarries and used in building blocks. These minerals cause
defects in building blocks, which lead to cracks and other problems in
buildings and homes constructed with the defective blocks.

Mica was mainly found in quarries in the north west of Ireland and some
properties in this area are affected by it. Pyrite caused similar problems in
buildings in the east of Ireland.

There are schemes in place to repair or rebuild homes that have been affected
by mica and pyrite.

##  What is the Enhanced Defective Concrete Blocks Grant Scheme?

The [ Enhanced Defective Concrete Blocks Grant Scheme
](https://www.gov.ie/en/service/8002e-enhanced-defective-concrete-blocks-
grant-scheme/?referrer=http://www.gov.ie/defectiveconcreteblocks/) provides
financial support to people, so they can fix properties that have been damaged
by the use of defective concrete blocks. Defective concrete blocks are blocks
that have excessive amounts of mica or pyrite.

The enhanced scheme is available in Clare, Donegal, Limerick and Mayo.

It began on 22 June 2023 replacing the original scheme.

The [ Remediation of Dwellings Damaged by the Use of Defective Concrete Blocks
Act 2022 ](https://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2022/act/28/enacted/en/html)
and the related [ regulations
](https://www.gov.ie/pdf/?file=https://assets.gov.ie/262454/05313c4e-49d5-4984-b75f-316787c06643.pdf#page=null)
provide the legislative basis for the new enhanced scheme.

###  Original scheme

The original scheme provided a grant for 90% of the work up to a maximum of
€247,500, if you had to completely re-build your home and was only available
in Donegal and Mayo. If you applied under the old scheme, you will be
transferred to the new one.

###  How much will I get?

The Enhanced Defective Concrete Blocks Grant Scheme covers 100% of remediation
work up to a maximum of €420,000.

The grant you get depends on the damage to your home and its size.

The grant has 5 remediation options (ways to solve the issue).

The options range from a full demolition and rebuild of the property to a
demolition and rebuild of the outer leafs of the affected walls in the
property.

The option you qualify for depends on the level of damage to your property.
The Housing Agency will assess and test your property to see which option is
most suitable.

The [ regulations
](https://www.gov.ie/pdf/?file=https://assets.gov.ie/262454/05313c4e-49d5-4984-b75f-316787c06643.pdf#page=null)
(pdf) explain how the grant amounts are calculated for each remediation
option.

###  **What is covered by the Enhanced Defective Concrete Blocks Grant
Scheme?**

The Enhanced Defective Concrete Blocks Grant Scheme covers:

  * Professional fees 
  * A building condition assessment report 
  * Approved remediation works 
  * Alternative accommodation costs 
  * Removal and storage costs 
  * Essential immediate repair work 
  * The cost of disconnecting and reconnecting services and utilities like electricity and internet 
  * Value Added Tax (VAT) 

The enhanced scheme also has:

  * A guarantee that you can get another grant, if you don’t have a full rebuild and then need a full rebuild in the next 40 years 
  * A different way of calculating the grant options 
  * A revised application process, which means there is no financial barrier to accessing the scheme 
  * An independent appeals process 

###  **Do I qualify for the scheme?**

To qualify for the Enhanced Defective Concrete Blocks Grant Scheme, your
property must:

  * Be damaged because defective concrete blocks were used to build it. Defective concrete blocks are blocks with excessive amounts of mica or pyrite in them. 
  * Be in Clare, Donegal, Limerick or Mayo 
  * Be your main residence, or a rented property that was [ registered with the Residential Tenancies Board ](/en/housing/renting-a-home/landlords-rights-and-responsibilities/registering-a-tenancy/) before 2 November 2021 
  * Have been built before 31 January 2020 
  * Not be an unauthorised structure 

The scheme may be extended to other counties in the future.

You can only get the grant for one rental property.

###  **How do I apply for the enhanced scheme?**

  1. **Get a report confirming the damage**

If you think your property has been damaged because defective concrete blocks
were used to build it, you should get a _competent building professional_ to
assess the damage.

A competent building professional is a [ building surveyor ](https://scsi.ie/)
, [ engineer ](https://www.engineersireland.ie/Professionals) or [ architect
](https://www.riai.ie/) who is listed on the statutory register for their
professional body and has done any required training.

They will assess your property and complete a building condition assessment
report. A template of the building condition assessment report is available in
[ Schedule 1 of the regulations
](https://www.gov.ie/pdf/?file=https://assets.gov.ie/262454/05313c4e-49d5-4984-b75f-316787c06643.pdf#page=null)
(pdf).

The report will recommend that you apply to your local authority for the
scheme if the damage to your property:

  * Is consistent with damage caused by defective concrete blocks 
  * Meets the damage threshold for the [ scheme (pdf) ](https://www.gov.ie/pdf/?file=https://assets.gov.ie/262454/05313c4e-49d5-4984-b75f-316787c06643.pdf#page=null)

A building condition assessment report costs approximately €500 to €750. You
pay for the report. But, if your application is successful, the grant will
cover this cost.  
  
2\. **Apply to your local authority**

If your building professional recommends it, you should apply to the local
authority for the scheme. You will need to send your building condition
assessment report to your local authority when you apply. Your local authority
will have information about how to apply on their website. They may use an
application form or an online portal.

  * [ Clare County Council ](https://www.clarecoco.ie/services/housing/dcb-scheme/)
  * [ Donegal County Council ](https://www.donegalcoco.ie/defectiveconcreteblocks/)
  * [ Limerick County Council ](https://www.limerick.ie/council/services/housing/grant-schemes-for-housing/defective-concrete-blocks-grant-scheme)
  * [ Mayo County Council ](https://www.mayo.ie/housing/defective-concrete-blocks-grant-scheme)

###  **How are applications decided?**

The local authority will send your application and report to the [ Housing
Agency ](https://www.housingagency.ie/) . The Housing Agency will review the
documents and check that your property meets the damage threshold for the
scheme. If your property meets the damage threshold, the Housing Agency will
tell your local authority and they will inform you.

Then, the Housing Agency will get a competent engineer to assess and test your
property. The Housing Agency will use this information to decide what
remediation option applies to your property and the grant amount you will get.
The local authority will contact you to give you this information.

###  **What if I applied for the original scheme?**

If you applied under the original scheme, your application will transfer to
the new scheme. You will benefit from the increased grant amounts available
under the new scheme. You may have to provide additional information to the
local authority. The [ FAQ on the new scheme
](https://www.gov.ie/pdf/?file=https://assets.gov.ie/262452/c72c696d-7e65-450f-aced-
aa843dcacc74.pdf#page=null) has a section on transitional arrangements that
describes fully how this works.

###  Where can I get more information about the scheme?

The Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage has published [
information about the scheme on gov.ie
](https://www.gov.ie/en/service/8002e-enhanced-defective-concrete-blocks-
grant-scheme/?referrer=http://www.gov.ie/defectiveconcreteblocks/) including a
detailed [ FAQ
](https://www.gov.ie/pdf/?file=https://assets.gov.ie/262462/d25a601a-d07d-4b67-aef1-680e51baa2e6.pdf#page=null)
.

The local authorities administering the scheme will also have information on
their websites about how the enhanced scheme works and can advise you about
the process.

##  What is the Defective Concrete Products Levy?

The Defective Concrete Products Levy is a [ 5% levy on concrete blocks,
pouring concrete and other concrete products ](https://www.gov.ie/en/press-
release/8b7cf-minister-donohoe-announces-changes-to-defective-concrete-
