#  Rural Social Scheme

  * Introduction 
  * How to qualify for the Rural Social Scheme 
  * Rates of payment for the Rural Social Scheme 
  * How to apply for the Rural Social Scheme 

##  Introduction

The Rural Social Scheme (RSS) is aimed at low-income farmers and fishermen and
fisherwomen. To qualify for RSS you must be getting a social welfare payment.
People participating in RSS provide services that benefit rural communities.

The Department of Social Protection (DSP) has overall responsibility for the
Rural Social Scheme, including eligibility criteria. The Department monitors
the implementation of RSS and supports the organisations that manage RSS
locally.

The Department may also inspect any scheme and visit projects. At a local
level, RSS is managed by implementing bodies such as local development
companies and in the Gaeltacht areas, by Údarás na Gaeltachta.

###  **What type of work is carried out by people on RSS ?**

The type of work carried out by people on RSS includes:

  * Maintaining and enhancing various walking routes, such as waymarked ways, agreed walks and bog roads 
  * Energy conservation work for older people and people at risk of poverty 
  * Village and countryside enhancement projects 
  * Social care and care of older people 
  * Community care for pre-school and after-school groups 
  * Environmental maintenance work - maintenance and caretaking of community and sporting facilities 
  * Projects relating to not-for-profit cultural and heritage centres 
  * Community administration or clerical work 
  * Other community-based projects 

###  How many hours' work is involved?

You work 19.5 hours per week. These hours are based on a farmer and fisher-
friendly schedule. This is to ensure participation does not affect your
farming/fishing activities. If you get a place on RSS, you are offered a
contract from your start date up to the following 31 March. You may be
considered for a further term following the initial contract, if you continue
to meet all the criteria for RSS.

The local management decides on your application. On 29 June 2022, the 6-year
time limit for participants on RSS was removed.

If you are eligible for RSS but don’t wish to participate, your dependent
spouse, civil partner or cohabitant may take the available place. However,
this is only if neither of you are participating in any other similar scheme,
for example, the Community Employment Scheme. The Rural Social Scheme operates
independently of the [ Community Employment Scheme (CE)
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/employment/unemployment-and-
redundancy/employment-support-schemes/community-employment-scheme/) .

##  How to qualify for the Rural Social Scheme

The Rural Social Scheme provides a supplementary income for low-income farmers
and fishermen and women who are unable to earn an adequate living.

To participate in RSS, you must:

  * Be 25 years or over and getting [ Farm Assist ](/en/social-welfare/farming-and-fishing/farm-assist/) , or 
  * Be actively farming or fishing and getting one of the following social welfare payments: 
    * [ Jobseeker's Allowance ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/social-welfare-payments/unemployed-people/jobseekers-allowance/)
    * [ Jobseeker's Transitional payment ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/social-welfare-payments/unemployed-people/jobseekers-transitional-payment/)
    * [ Disability Allowance ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/social-welfare-payments/disability-and-illness/disability-allowance/)
    * [ One-Parent Family Payment ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/social-welfare-payments/families-and-children/one-parent-family-payment/)
    * [ Widow's, Widower's or Surviving Civil Partner's Contributory Pension ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/social-welfare-payments/death-related-benefits/widowed-persons-contrib-pension/) or [ Widow's, Widower's or Surviving Civil Partner's Non-Contributory Pension ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/social-welfare-payments/death-related-benefits/widowed-persons-non-contrib-pension/)
    * Increase for a Qualified Adult under 66 years of age as part of your spouse, cohabitant or civil partner's [ State Pension (Non-Contributory) ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/social-welfare-payments/older-and-retired-people/state-pension-non-contributory/)

###  Actively farming or fishing criteria

####  **Criteria for a farmer**

You must provide proof that you are actively farming. To do this, you must
provide a copy of your application for the [ Basic Payment Scheme
](https://www.gov.ie/en/service/f16b22-basic-payment-scheme/) for the current
year, including a valid herd number. If you are actively farming and have not
applied for the Basic Payment Scheme, you should contact your local RSS
implementing body for advice.

####  **Child or sibling of a farmer**

If you are a child or sibling of a herd number owner and you can certify that
you live or work on the farm, and you are getting one of the qualifying social
welfare payments, you may be able to participate in RSS using your parent or
sibling’s herd number.

####  **Spouse, civil partner or cohabitant of a farmer**

If you are eligible but do not wish to participate in RSS, your dependent
spouse, civil partner or cohabitant can take the available place.

Or, if your spouse, civil partner or cohabitant is getting one of the
qualifying social welfare payments and is actively farming, they can use your
herd number to qualify for RSS.

Your spouse, civil partner or cohabitant can participate in RSS, if they are
under 66 and you are getting a State Pension (Non-Contributory) which includes
an Increase for Qualified Adult for them.

###  **Criteria for a fisherman or fisherwoman**

If you are a fisherman or fisherwoman, you must meet one of the following
categories to qualify for RSS:

  * You are self-employed on a fishing boat that has been entered in the Register of Fishing Boats. 
  * You are self-employed and your boat has been issued with a pot fishing licence. 
  * You are self-employed and you have been issued with a commercial salmon fishing licence from Inland Fisheries Ireland. 
  * You are self-employed and you have been issued with a commercial eel fishing licence from Inland Fisheries Ireland. 
  * You are self-employed and you have been issued with a dredging licence for shellfish from Inland Fisheries Ireland. 
  * You have [ an aquaculture licence ](https://www.agriculture.gov.ie/seafood/aquacultureforeshoremanagement/aquaculturelicensing/) . 
  * You have a permit for shell fishing issued by a registered cooperative. 

**Spouse, civil partner or cohabitant of a fisherman or fisherwoman**

If you are eligible but do not wish to participate in RSS, your dependent
spouse, civil partner or cohabitant **cannot** take the available place.

##  Rates of payment for the Rural Social Scheme

The rates of payment for new participants on RSS depends on your qualifying
DSP payment. The minimum weekly payment increased to **€259.50 in January
2024.**

If the actual social welfare payment (including dependants) you were getting
is €232 a week or less, then you will get the minimum RSS weekly rate of
€259.50 (that is €232 plus €27.50). If your actual weekly social welfare
payment (including dependants) was €232.01 or more, then you will get the
equivalent rate plus €27.50.

If you were getting an age-related reduced rate of payment, your payment is
increased to the minimum weekly rate of €259.50.

**Weekly** **Rural Social Scheme rates 2024**

**Qualifying payment** |  **Rate of RSS payment**  
---|---  
Jobseeker's Allowance or Farm Assist  |  Equal to your current rate of payment plus €27.50 top-up. Minimum weekly payment of €259.50   
One-Parent Family Payment  |  Equal to your current rate of payment plus €27.50 top-up. Minimum weekly payment of €259.50.   
Disability Allowance  |  Equal to your current rate of payment plus €27.50 top-up. Minimum weekly payment of €259.50.   
Widow's, Widower's or Surviving Civil Partner's Contributory Pension  |  You continue to get your pension with a top-up of €27.50.   
Widow's, Widower's or Surviving Civil Partner's Non-Contributory Pension  |  You continue to get your pension with a top-up of €27.50 (The minimum combined payment is €259.50).   
Qualified Adult on a State Pension (Non-Contributory)  |  Your spouse will continue to get the Increase for a Qualified Adult (IQA). Your RSS rate will be the difference between your IQA payment and €259.50.   
  
**PRSI contribution**

A Class A PRSI contribution is paid on behalf of all RSS participants. You do
not have to pay [ Universal Social Charge (USC) ](/en/money-and-
tax/tax/income-tax/universal-social-charge/) on your RSS payment.

**Tax**

Your income is liable for tax. Depending on your circumstances, it is likely
you will pay little or no tax. Find out [ more about tax ](/en/money-and-
tax/tax/income-tax/) .

**Other social welfare payments**

If you are getting other social welfare payments you should check with your [
Intreo Centre or Social Welfare Branch Office
](https://www.gov.ie/en/directory/category/e1f4b5-intreo-offices/) to find out
whether they will be affected. You can keep your [ medical card
](/en/health/medical-cards-and-gp-visit-cards/medical-card/) while you are
taking part in the Rural Social Scheme.

####  Changes to your circumstances

The rules that apply to your original social welfare payment also apply to
your RSS payment. This means that, if your dependant gets a job, their income
will be assessed as means and your RSS payment may be reduced.

Your RSS payment cannot be reduced below the minimum rate of €259.50. To avoid
any possible overpayments, if there is any change in your circumstances, you
should inform your local RSS implementing body.

##  How to apply for the Rural Social Scheme

You should contact your [ local RSS implementing body
](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/eb8f4e-rural-social-scheme-list-of-
implementing-bodies/) for further information or an application form.

You can also read the Department of Social Protection's [ guidelines on the
Rural Social Scheme ](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/e8c048-operational-
