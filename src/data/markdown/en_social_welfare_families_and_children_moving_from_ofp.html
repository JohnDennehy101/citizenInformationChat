Transition from One-Parent Family Payment

#  Transition from One-Parent Family Payment

  * Introduction 
  * Rules 

##  Introduction

The child age limit for the [ One-Parent Family Payment ](/en/social-
welfare/families-and-children/one-parent-family-payment/) (OFP) is set at 7
years of age. There are exemptions to the age limit for people parenting alone
who are getting a Domiciliary Care Allowance or Blind Pension, who are caring
or who have been recently bereaved.

This document gives an overview of the options open to you. You can also get
more information and advice at [ your Intreo Centre or Social Welfare Branch
Office ](http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/List-of-Social-Welfare-Local-and-
Branch-Offices-by-County.aspx) or your nearest [ Citizens Information Centre
](http://centres.citizensinformation.ie/) .

##  Rules

###  Jobseeker’s Transitional payment

Most people who no longer qualify for a One-Parent Family Payment because
their youngest child is aged 7 will transfer to the Jobseeker’s Transitional
payment (called JST).

JST is paid to people who are not cohabiting and whose youngest child is aged
between 7 and 13. It aims to support you into the workforce while also
acknowledging that you are caring for young children. You can take part in a
course of education and get JST. You can get more information in our document
on the [ Jobseeker’s Transitional payment ](/en/social-welfare/unemployed-
people/jobseekers-transitional-payment/) .

###  OFP and Working Family Payment

If you are working and getting [ Working Family Payment (WFP) ](/en/social-
welfare/families-and-children/working-family-payment/) in addition to OFP,
your WFP will be automatically reviewed when your OFP ends. In most cases this
will lead to an increase in your WFP.

You may also qualify for the [ Back to Work Family Dividend (BTWFD)
](/en/social-welfare/families-and-children/back-to-work-family-dividend/) .
This payment allows parents getting One-Parent Family Payment or a jobseeker’s
payment to keep the full [ Increase for a Qualified Child ](/en/social-
welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/claiming-a-social-welfare-
payment/claiming-and-increase-in-your-payment-for-a-child-dependant/) for the
first year of employment or self-employment and half that amount in the second
year. BTWFD can be paid as well as WFP and it will have no impact on your
entitlement to WFP.

If you have a general question about Working Family Payment, you can call the
WFP section at (043) 334 0053 or e-mail [ WFPSupport@welfare.ie
](mailto:FISSection@welfare.ie) .

###  OFP and Carer’s Allowance

People parenting alone, who meet the qualifying criteria for Carer's
Allowance, may qualify for both One-Parent Family Payment and [ half-rate
Carer's Allowance (CA) ](/en/social-welfare/carers/half-rate-carers-
allowance/) . If your youngest child is aged between 7 and 15, you must
qualify for Carer's Allowance to continue to get OFP. You will also get an
Increase for a Qualified Child (IQC) for any other children in the family
until they reach 18 (or 22 if in full-time education) while CA and OFP is in
payment. (See our document on [ One-Parent Family Payment ](/en/social-
welfare/families-and-children/one-parent-family-payment/) for more information
on other exceptions to the age limits.)

This means that you can claim OFP and a half-rate Carer’s Allowance until your
youngest child turns 16 provided you continue to meet the conditions for both
schemes.

###  OFP and Domiciliary Care Allowance

If you are getting [ Domiciliary Care Allowance (DCA) ](/en/social-
welfare/disability-and-illness/domiciliary-care-allowance/) for one of your
children, the age limit of 7 for the youngest child does not apply, and you
can retain your OFP payment. This means that you can continue to qualify for
OFP until that child is aged 16 or your DCA stops. You will also get an IQC
for any other children in the family until they reach 18 (or 22 if in full-
time education) while DCA and OFP is in payment. If your youngest child is
under 7 years of age when your DCA stops you may also continue to qualify for
OFP.

###  OFP and Blind Pension

[ Blind Pension ](/en/social-welfare/disability-and-illness/blind-persons-
pension/) is payable with OFP. This means that a person who qualifies for OFP
and Blind Pension can get both payments at the full rate. People who qualify
for Blind Pension will be exempted from the age conditions for OFP. This means
that you can claim both Blind Pension and OFP (and any IQCs payable with both
Blind Pension and OFP) together until your youngest child is 16 years of age.

###  OFP and return to education

If you are taking part in a recognised education course when your entitlement
to OFP ends you can finish your course and get a payment. The payment you
qualify for depends on your circumstances.

If you are in education and your OFP ends because your youngest child has
reached the age limit you can move to the Jobseeker’s Transitional payment
(JST) and continue your course. You can claim JST and a student grant at the
same time and the grant will not be assessed as means for JST. However, you
should note that you cannot claim [ Rent Supplement ](/en/social-
welfare/supplementary-welfare-schemes/rent-supplement/) if you are getting a
student grant or if you are in full-time education. (Entitlement to HAP is not
affected by this rule.)

It is important to remember that your entitlement to JST will end when your
youngest child reaches the age of 14. If you have not finished your course
when your youngest child reaches the age of 14 you will have to either
transfer to the [ Back to Education Allowance ](/en/social-welfare/back-to-
education/back-to-education-allowance/) to complete your course or opt to
remain in receipt of your student grant.

###  OFP and employment schemes

If you are on an [ employment scheme ](/en/employment/unemployment-and-
redundancy/employment-support-schemes/schemes-to-support-employment/) (such as
Community Employment) when your entitlement to OFP ends, you can continue on
the scheme until it finishes and get a payment. Department of Social
Protection (DSP) staff will arrange this for you.

###  OFP and housing support

Most sources of income (including OFP) are taken into account in the means
test for social housing support and the calculation of differential rents.

If you are [ applying for social housing ](/en/housing/local-authority-and-
social-housing/applying-for-local-authority-housing/) , you should notify the
local authority of any change in your income so that your means can be
reassessed.

If you are already renting from a [ local authority
](http://www.housing.gov.ie/local-government/administration/local-
authorities/local-authorities) or a [ housing association ](/en/housing/local-
authority-and-social-housing/approved-housing-bodies/) , you should notify
them of any change in your income so that your rent can be recalculated. If
you are renting under the [ Housing Assistance Payment (HAP)
](/en/housing/renting-a-home/help-with-renting/housing-assistance-payment/)
scheme, you should notify the local authority of any change in your income so
that your rent contribution can be recalculated.

If you are on Rent Supplement, any change in your circumstances may affect
your entitlement and you should notify the Department of Social Protection
office that pays your Rent Supplement. In particular, as noted above, you
cannot claim Rent Supplement if you are getting a student grant or if you are
in full-time education. There is also a limit to the number of hours you can
work per week and continue to get Rent Supplement. (Note, if you transfer to
HAP instead, you can work full-time and keep your entitlement to HAP.)
