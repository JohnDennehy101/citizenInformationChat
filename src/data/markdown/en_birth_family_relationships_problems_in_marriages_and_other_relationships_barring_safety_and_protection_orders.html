##  What is domestic violence?

Domestic violence is the use of physical or emotional force or threat of
physical force, including sexual violence, in an intimate relationship. As
well as physical violence, domestic violence can also involve:

  * Emotional abuse 
  * The destruction of property 
  * Controlling behaviour such as isolation from friends, family and other potential sources of support 
  * Threats to others including children 
  * Stalking 
  * Control over access to money, personal items, food, transportation and communication 

A new offence of [ coercive control ](https://www.womensaid.ie/help/coercive-
control.html) of a spouse, civil partner or intimate partner also came into
force under the [ Domestic Violence Act 2018
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2018/act/6/enacted/en/html) . Coercive
control is a pattern of intimidation, humiliation and controlling behaviour
that causes fear of violence or serious distress that has a substantial impact
on the victim's day-to-day activities.

##  If you are in danger

**If you feel in immediate danger, call 112 or 999.** Members of the Gardaí
are specially trained to deal with these situations and help you get support.

If you have been the victim of a sexual assault, you can go to a [ Sexual
Assault Treatment Unit (SATU) ](https://www2.hse.ie/sexual-assault-treatment-
units/) for immediate medical care. You do not need a referral but you should
[ call your local unit ](https://www2.hse.ie/services/satu/contact/) before
you arrive. These services are free and available 24 hours a day, 7 days a
week.

[ Finding Your Way after Sexual Violence ](https://www.drcc.ie/fyw) is an
online guide to the options and supports available after rape, sexual assault
and other forms of sexual violence. The guide has information on accessing a
Sexual Assault Treatment Unit (SATU), reporting to the Gardaí, and where to go
for help.

##  Court orders

Under domestic violence legislation, the main kinds of protection available
are safety orders and barring orders. These are explained below.

##  What is a safety order?

A [ safety order ](https://services.courts.ie/Family-Law/domestic-
violence/understanding-court-orders-and-eligibility/what-is-a-safety-order) is
an instruction from the court which stops the person accused of abusive
behaviour (the respondent) from committing further violence or threats of
violence. The respondent does not have to leave the home. If the person is not
living with you, the safety order prohibits (bans) them from watching or being
near your home and following or communicating (including electronically) with
you or a dependent person such as a child. A safety order can last up to 5
years.

People in an intimate relationship are also able for apply for a safety order.
Previously, couples had to cohabit (live together) to be able to get a safety
order, but this is no longer the case. The following people can apply for a
safety order:

  * Spouses and civil partners 
  * Parents with a child in common 
  * Partners in an intimate relationship including cohabitants (a couple living together) and dating partners (a couple not living together) 
  * Parents of an abusive child if that child is over 18 
  * People residing with the respondent in a non-contractual relationship, such as two relatives living together 

Former partners are also able to apply, for example, a former spouse or
cohabitant.

###  What is a protection order?

Between the time of making an application for a safety order (or barring
order) and the court’s determination (decision), there may be reasonable
grounds for believing that the safety and welfare of you or of a dependent
person is at risk. If so, the court can grant a protection order to prohibit
(ban) the person accused of the abusive behaviour from:

  * Using or threatening to use violence 
  * If the person is not living with you, watching or being near your home 
  * Following or communicating with you or a dependent person 

A protection order is temporary and only effective until the court hearing for
the application for a safety order (or barring order). It is sometimes called
a 'temporary safety order' because it gives the same protection as a safety
order but for a shorter time period.

##  What is a barring order?

A [ barring order ](https://services.courts.ie/Family-Law/domestic-
violence/understanding-court-orders-and-eligibility/what-is-a-barring-order)
requires the person accused of abusive behaviour to leave the home and
prohibits (bans) the person from entering the home. The order also prohibits
the person from:

  * Further violence or threats of violence 
  * Watching or being near your home, or 
  * Following or communicating (including electronically) with you or a dependent person 

A barring order can last up to 3 years.

The following people can apply for a barring order:

  * Spouses and civil partners 
  * Cohabitants (a couple living together) who live in an intimate relationship (the applicant must satisfy the property test, that is, they must have an equal or greater interest in the property than the respondent) 
  * Parents when the abuser is a non-dependent child 

###  What is an interim barring order?

Between the time of making an application for a barring order and the court’s
determination (decision), there may be reasonable grounds for believing that
the safety and welfare of you or of a dependent person is at risk. If so, the
court can grant a protection order (see above) or an interim barring order. An
interim barring order is a temporary, immediate short-term order. It can last
for a maximum of 8 working days. It requires the person accused of violent or
abusive behaviour to leave the home where there is an immediate risk of
significant harm to you or a dependent person (and a protection order would
not give sufficient protection).

You can apply for an interim barring order while you wait for the court to
hear your full application for a full barring order. Both applications can be
made at the same time.

###  What is an emergency barring order?

An [ emergency barring order ](https://services.courts.ie/Family-Law/domestic-
violence/understanding-court-orders-and-eligibility/what-is-an-interim-
barring-order) requires the person accused of violent or abusive behaviour to
leave the home, and prohibits them from entering the home. This is an
immediate order where there is reasonable grounds to believe there is an
immediate risk of significant harm to you or a dependent person.

Unlike an interim barring order, the applicant does not have to satisfy the
property test to be able to get an emergency barring order. This means the
person applying for the order does not need to own, co-own or have their name
on the lease of the property. An emergency barring order can last for a
maximum of 8 working days. It prohibits the same behaviours as a barring
order.

When the 8-day time limit ends, you may have to wait for one month to apply
for another. In exceptional circumstances, a judge can waive or ignore this
one-month wait time.

##  Applying for an order

To get a safety or barring order you must attend a District Court hearing.
While you are waiting for the court to hear your application, the court can
give you an immediate order.

In an emergency situation, the Gardaí can request that the Courts Service
arrange a special out-of-hours sitting of the District Court for someone
looking for an interim barring order, protection order or emergency barring
order.

A safety order or barring order can be renewed by applying for a further order
before the previous one expires.

There is [ a list of factors that the court can consider when deciding on an
application for a domestic violence order
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2018/act/6/section/5/enacted/en/html#sec5)
(safety, protection or barring order). This list includes:

  * History of violence by the respondent towards the applicant or any dependent person 
  * Increase in severity or frequency of violence towards the applicant or their children 
  * Exposure of children to violence inflicted by the respondent on the applicant or other child 
  * History of animal cruelty 
  * Substance abuse (including alcohol), by the respondent, the applicant or a dependent person 
  * The age and state of health (including pregnancy) of the applicant or any dependent person   

##  Who can get a barring or safety order?

###  Spouses and civil partners

If you are married or in a civil partnership, and you can show the court that
your spouse or civil partner is violent in any way towards you or the
children, you can get a barring or safety order against them no matter how
long you have lived together and even if they own most or all of the house.

###  Cohabiting couples

If you have lived together in an intimate relationship, you can get a safety
order against a violent partner. You can also get a safety order against a
person you have had a child with but are not living with or have never lived
with.

You can get a barring order against a violent partner if you have been living
together in an intimate relationship and your partner does not own most or all
of the house you are living in. There is no minimum period of cohabitation
(living together) required.

You can get an emergency barring order where there are reasonable grounds to
believe there is an immediate risk of significant harm to you or a dependent
even if you do not own, co-own or have your name on the lease.

###  Parents

A parent can apply for a barring or safety order against domestic violence
from their own child if their child is over 18. You cannot get a barring order
if your child owns all or most of the house you are living in.

###  Others living together

Others living together, for example, two relatives, can apply for a safety
order.

###  Children

The Domestic Violence Act 2018 contains specific provisions for the protection
of children including:

  * Children can make their views known to the court where a safety or barring order is sought on behalf of, or will partly relate to, a child. The court can appoint an expert to assist the court to get the views of the child depending on the child’s age and maturity. 
  * When giving evidence in an application for a domestic violence order, a child cannot be cross-examined in person by the respondent or the applicant. 
  * Domestic violence orders relating to children remain in force until the order expires even after they reach the age of 18. Previously they expired when the child became 18 years old. 

###  Tusla - The Child and Family Agency

[ Tusla - The Child and Family Agency ](https://www.tusla.ie/) may apply for a
safety or barring order against a violent adult on behalf of a child, whether
or not that violent adult is married to the child's parent.

###  What happens if an order is broken?

Anyone who breaks a court order (safety order, protection order, barring
order, interim barring order or emergency barring order) is guilty of an
offence. If the person accused of violence or domestic abuse prevents you or
your dependants from entering or remaining in a place to which the order
relates (while the order is in effect), this is also an offence.

The above offences under Section 33 of the Domestic Violence Act 2018 are
punishable by a [ class B fine ](/en/justice/criminal-law/criminal-
trial/fines-for-criminal-offences/) , a prison term of up to 12 months, or
both.

When the court is deciding the sentencing for certain offences such as
psychological, physical violence, sexual violence, coercive control and
stalking, it is now considered an aggravating circumstance if the victim is or
was a spouse, civil partner or in an intimate relationship with the offender.
This means the court shall give a sentence which is greater than would have
been given because of the fact that the victim and perpetrator (abuser) were
in an intimate relationship. This is introduced by [ Section 40 of the
Domestic Violence Act 2018
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2018/act/6/section/40/enacted/en/html#sec40)
.

##  How to get a safety or barring order

How you apply for a domestic violence protection order depends on the type of
protection you are applying for.

The Courts Service has a [ step-by-step guide to the steps for applying for a
domestic violence order ](https://services.courts.ie/Family-Law/domestic-
violence/how-to-apply-for-a-domestic-violence-order) from the District Court.
Most applications for domestic violence protection orders are made in the
District Court.

You can hire a solicitor to make an application on your behalf or you can make
the application yourself. You may be entitled to [ legal aid
](/en/justice/legal-aid-and-advice/legal-aid-board/) .

Go to [ your local District Court Office ](https://www.courts.ie/content/find-
us) . The District Court Office staff will tell you the forms you need to make
your application. If you are applying for a barring order or a safety order,
the court clerk will arrange a court date for a court hearing. You will be
given your summons for the court hearing at the time of your application. The
forms will be sent to the respondent (the person accused of the violent or
abusive behaviour) so that they can attend in court on the day of the hearing.
You do not need a solicitor to make an application, but it is recommended that
you have legal representation for a full court hearing.

The decision of the court is produced in the form of a written document called
an 'order'. If the respondent is in court when the order is made the
respondent is considered to be notified and it is sent by the court office to
the respondent by ordinary post. However, in the case of a protection order,
interim barring order or emergency barring order the court usually directs
that order be served on the respondent by a member of the Gardaí.

The court office will notify the Gardaí of the making of the order by sending
a copy to the local Garda station by post. To avoid any delay in notifying the
Gardaí you should call to the Garda station immediately after the order has
been made, tell them of the making of the order and leave a copy with them
(you can allow them to take a photocopy). A copy of your order will be sent to
the superintendent of your local Garda station by registered post the
following day.

###  **What if there is an emergency?**

If there is an emergency situation or while you are waiting to go to court to
get a barring order or safety order, you can get a protection order, an
interim barring order, or an emergency barring order if you or a dependent
child is at immediate risk of significant harm. If there is no sitting of the
District Court at the time when you wish to make such an application, a member
of the Gardaí may request the Courts Service to arrange a special sitting of
the District Court. If you do not want a protection order or an interim
barring order immediately, you can seek one at any time before your case is
heard for a safety or barring order.

Further information on making an application and preparing for a court hearing
is available on the [ Courts Service website
](https://www.courts.ie/procedure-district-court-civil) .

##  Going to court

If you have to go to court it is always recommended you get legal advice. A
solicitor who specialises in family law can help you by explaining the process
