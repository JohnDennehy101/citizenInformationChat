##  Recycling business waste

You should handle and dispose of your company’s waste in line with [ waste
management regulations and legislation ](/en/environment/waste-and-
recycling/littering-and-dumping/) .

Encourage employees to recycle paper, plastic, glass and tin in your workplace
by [ downloading posters ](https://www.mywaste.ie/business/) and [ ordering
bin labels and checklists ](https://www.mywaste.ie/business/#order-resources)
from MyWaste.ie.

Before you dispose of waste, check if it can be repaired. [ Find local repair
professionals ](https://www.repairmystuff.ie/) on repairmystuff.ie or [
contact your local authority ](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/942f74-local-
authorities/) for advice.

###  Waste electronic equipment

You can recycle waste from electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) for
free.

**Small electronic items, like household items**

Bring small electronic items, such as computers, desktop printers and
batteries (and other electrical items often found in a household) to your
local civic amenity site. Here it will be collected for recycling instead of
being sent to a landfill. [ Contact your local authority
](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/942f74-local-authorities/) for more
information, or find your nearest recycling point using the [ WEEE Ireland map
](https://www.weeeireland.ie/household-recycling/where-can-i-recycle/) .

You can also bring WEEE to a local electrical retailer. Retailers must take
back your old electrical equipment, for free, on a one-for-one, like-for-like
basis. This means the old product must be of the same type (or have the same
purpose) as the new item purchased.

**Larger electronic equipment**

You can correctly dispose of larger electronic equipment, such as
photocopiers, servers, cash registers or vending machines, by contacting your
equipment supplier or a local licenced waste contractor.

Read more about  recycling waste electrical and electronic equipment  .

###  End-of-life company car or light commercial vehicle

If you have a company car or a light commercial vehicle (of less than 3.5
tonnes) that is due to be disposed of or scrapped, it is called an _end-of-
life vehicle_ (ELV).

You must dispose of an end-of-life vehicle using licensed _authorised
treatment facilities_ (ATFs, also called _permitted scrapyards_ ). This is
because end of life vehicles contain hazardous materials that can damage the
environment and pose a risk to public health if not disposed of safely. For
example, vehicles contain lead acid batteries, lubricating oil, coolant, brake
fluid, and catalytic convertors.

Read about [ how to dispose of an end-of-life vehicle ](/en/travel-and-
recreation/motoring/buying-or-selling-a-vehicle/how-to-dispose-of-an-end-of-
life-vehicle/) .
