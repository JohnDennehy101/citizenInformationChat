##  Introduction

If you are travelling to Ireland and you are not a citizen of the UK,
Switzerland, or a country in the European Economic Area (the EU plus Norway,
Iceland and Lichtenstein), you may need to apply for a visa.

An Irish visa is a certificate placed on your passport or travel document that
allows you to travel to Ireland. You still have to present your passport and
documents to immigration control when you arrive at the airport or port, and
an immigration officer may still [ refuse you entry to Ireland ](/en/moving-
country/visas-for-ireland/permission-to-land-in-ireland/) .

If you are [ travelling with children ](https://www.irishimmigration.ie/at-
the-border/travelling-with-children/) , you have to apply for a visa for your
children too.

You may also have to [ register with immigration authorities ](/en/moving-
country/moving-to-ireland/rights-of-residence-in-ireland/registration-of-non-
eea-nationals-in-ireland/) .

###  Ukrainian citizens

From 25 February 2022, citizens of Ukraine [ do not need a visa to travel to
Ireland ](https://www.irishimmigration.ie/minister-mcentee-has-announced-the-
immediate-lifting-of-visa-requirements-between-ukraine-and-ireland/) . Read
information for people who have [ arrived in Ireland from Ukraine
](/en/moving-country/asylum-seekers-and-refugees/the-asylum-process-in-
ireland/coming-to-ireland-from-ukraine/) .

##  Do I need a visa?

You do not need a visa to land in Ireland if you:

  * Are a citizen of the EU or the EEA (the EU plus Iceland, Norway and Lichtenstein) or Switzerland 
  * Have a residence card issued by an EEA country or Switzerland because you are the family member of an EEA or Swiss citizen living in a country outside of the EEA/Swiss family member’s home country (for example, you live in Germany with your French spouse) 
  * Have a UK short-stay visa and qualify for the short-stay visa waiver or the British-Irish Visa Scheme (see ‘Visa waivers for UK visa holders’ below) 
  * Are a school student who lives in an EU/EEA country and you are travelling as part of a school trip (see ‘School Student Visa Waiver’ below) 
  * Are a citizen of a country listed in the table below. 

Andorra  |  Hong Kong (Special Admin. Region)  |  Samoa   
---|---|---  
Antigua & Barbuda  |  Israel  |  San Marino   
Argentina  |  Japan  |  Seychelles

From 10 July 2024, nationals of [ Botswana and South Africa must get a visa
](https://www.irishimmigration.ie/visa-requirement-for-nationals-of-botswana-
and-south-africa/) before travelling to Ireland.

**Note** **UK:** Visa free travel also applies to the following types of
British nationality:

  * British national (overseas) 
  * British overseas territories citizen (previously called ‘British dependent territories citizenship) 
  * British overseas citizen 

Visa free travel **does not** apply to people who have a British passport as a
‘British protected person'.

If you are moving to Ireland to live with your Irish de facto partner, a
spouse or partner who holds a Critical Skills Employment Permit, or your UK
spouse or partner, you have to apply for preclearance even if you are from one
of the countries listed above (this does not apply to citizens of Switzerland
or the UK). See ‘Do I need preclearance’ below.

If you have a short stay visa for the UK and are an Indian or Chinese citizen,
you can travel to Ireland without a visa. See ‘Visa waivers for UK visa
holders’ below.

###  Travelling with a refugee travel document

If you have a refugee [ travel document ](/en/moving-country/asylum-seekers-
and-refugees/refugee-status-and-leave-to-remain/travel-documents-for-
refugees/) issued by a country outside Ireland, you must apply for a visa to
enter Ireland. Visa free travel for travel document holders is suspended until
further notice.

###  Family members of EEA/Swiss citizens

If you are coming to Ireland to [ join or accompany your EEA family member
](/en/moving-country/moving-to-ireland/rights-of-residence-in-
ireland/registration-of-non-eea-nationals-in-ireland/) , you must apply for a
visa if you are from a country that is not in the list above. If you are
already living in another EEA country or Switzerland because you are the
family member of an EEA or Swiss citizen who is exercising their free movement
rights, you do not need a visa to travel to Ireland.

If you plan to stay in Ireland for more than 3 months you must [ apply for
residence ](https://www.irishimmigration.ie/coming-to-join-family-in-
ireland/joining-an-eea-or-swiss-national/eu-treaty-rights/) after your
arrival.

##  Types of visa

The type of visa you need depends on the purpose and length of your stay in
Ireland.

###  Short stay visas

If you want to come to Ireland for less than 3 months, you should apply for a
[ short stay ‘C’ visa ](https://www.irishimmigration.ie/short-stay-visas-
policy/) . You should apply for this type of visa if you want to come to
Ireland as a tourist or to visit someone, for a business meeting, or to attend
a short course.

You cannot stay for longer than 3 months on a ‘C’ visa. You must leave Ireland
and apply for another visa if you want to return.

###  Long stay visas

If you want to come to Ireland for more than 3 months, for example to study,
for work or to settle permanently in Ireland with family members who live in
Ireland, then you can apply for a [ long stay ‘D’ visa
](https://www.irishimmigration.ie/) .

If you are granted a long stay ‘D’ visa and wish to remain in the State for
longer than 3 months you must register and get an Irish Residence Permit
(IRP).

You can read more information about different types of visa available on the [
ISD website ](https://www.irishimmigration.ie/) .

###  Re-entry multiple entry visas

The first visa issued to you is valid for a single entry to the State. If you
leave Ireland, you must apply for another visa to travel to Ireland again.

If you have had single entry visas in the past and you have obeyed the
conditions of those visas, you can apply for a multiple entry visa. You can
also apply if you need to come to Ireland frequently for business. A multiple
entry visa allows you to travel to Ireland on more than one occasion during
the period that the visa is valid.

####  Re-entry visas for people who live in Ireland

If you have a valid Irish Residence Permit (IRP), you no longer need a re-
entry visa to re-enter Ireland when traveling abroad. Children under 16 do not
get an IRP. They can [ return to Ireland without a re-entry visa
](https://www.irishimmigration.ie/suspension-of-re-entry-visa-requirements-
for-children-under-the-age-of-16-years-2/) if they are travelling with parents
or guardians. The parents or guardians must have an IRP.

###  Transit visas

If you are travelling through Ireland on your way to another country, you may
need a [ transit visa ](https://www.irishimmigration.ie/at-the-border/transit-
including-transfer-visa-advice/) when arriving in Ireland on their way to
another country. A transit visa does not permit you to leave the port or
airport. If you are a citizen of one of the following countries, you will need
a valid Irish transit visa when landing in the State:

**Countries that require an Irish transit visa** Afghanistan  |  Ghana   
---|---  
Albania  |  Honduras   
Bolivia  |  Iran   
Botswana  |  Iraq   
Cuba  |  Lebanon   
Democratic Republic of the Congo  |  Moldova   
Dominica  |  Nigeria   
Eritrea  |  Somalia   
Ethiopia  |  South Africa   
Georgia  |  Sri Lanka   
Vanuatu  
  
##  Visa waivers for UK visa holders

The [ Short Stay Visa Waiver Programme
](https://www.irishimmigration.ie/coming-to-visit-ireland/frequently-asked-
questions/) allows nationals of a number of Eastern European, Middle Eastern
and Asian countries who have a short-term UK visa, to come to Ireland without
the need for a separate Irish visa. The countries included in the scheme are:

  * Bahrain 
  * Bosnia and Herzegovina 
  * China 
  * Colombia 
  * India 
  * Indonesia 
  * Kazakhstan 
  * Kosovo 
  * Kuwait 
  * Montenegro 
  * North Macedonia 
  * Oman 
  * Peru 
  * Philippines 
  * Qatar 
  * Saudi Arabia 
  * Serbia 
  * Thailand 
  * Türkiye 
  * Ukraine 
  * Uzbekistan 
  * Vietnam 

Citizens of **India and China** , who have a short stay UK visa can travel to
Ireland under the [ British Irish Visa Scheme (BIVS)
](https://www.irishimmigration.ie/coming-to-visit-ireland/british-irish-visa-
scheme/) without a separate Irish visa. You can also use your Irish visa to
travel to the UK. Your visa must be endorsed with ‘BIVS’.

##  School Student Visa Waiver

School students who are citizens of a country that would normally need a visa
to enter Ireland can apply for a waiver if they live in an EU or EEA country
and are travelling as part of a school trip.

The principal of the school must complete an [ application form
](https://www.irishimmigration.ie/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Visa-Waiver-for-
non-EEA-and-EU-School-Students-v2.pdf) and present this form to immigration
upon arrival.

##  Do I need preclearance?

If you do not need a visa to come to Ireland, you may still have to apply for
preclearance. Preclearance is permission to enter Ireland to apply to reside
for certain reasons. You have to apply for preclearance if you want to come to
Ireland:

  * To [ volunteer ](https://www.irishimmigration.ie/coming-to-work-in-ireland/what-are-my-options-for-working-in-ireland/coming-to-work-for-more-than-90-days/volunteer/)
  * As a [ minister of religion ](https://www.irishimmigration.ie/coming-to-work-in-ireland/what-are-my-options-for-working-in-ireland/coming-to-work-for-more-than-90-days/minister-of-religion/)
  * As the [ de facto partner of a Critical Skills Employment Permit or Hosting Agreement holder ](https://www.irishimmigration.ie/coming-to-join-family-in-ireland/joining-an-eea-or-swiss-national/de-facto-partner-of-a-critical-skills-employment-permit-holder-csep-or-hosting-agreement-holder-ha/)
  * As the [ de facto partner of an Irish citizen ](https://www.irishimmigration.ie/coming-to-join-family-in-ireland/joining-an-irish-national/de-facto-partner-of-an-irish-national/)
  * As the [ family member of a UK citizen ](https://www.irishimmigration.ie/coming-to-join-family-in-ireland/joining-your-uk-national-family-member/)

A de facto partnership is when you are in a relationship with someone that is
like a marriage.

You can apply for pre-clearance online. If you are approved, and you intend to
stay in Ireland for more than 3 months, you have to register for an Irish
Residence Permit after you arrive in Ireland.
