#  Role of the judge

  * Judgments and juries 
  * Appointment of judges 
  * Complaints about judges 
  * Judicial assistant 
  * Contacts 

##  Introduction

The judge in an Irish courtroom usually sits on a raised platform at the top
of the court and wears white collars and a black gown.

In the past, judges in Ireland were referred to as "My Lord", or "His
Lordship". Now, they are addressed as "Judge" or referred to as "The Court".
The only exception to this is in the case of the Chief Justice and Presidents
of the various lower courts, who are addressed by their titles.

##  Judgments and juries

###  **If there is no jury**

If there is no [ jury
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/justice/courtroom/jury/) in a case, it
is the judge who decides which party wins and which party loses.

The judge listens to the [ evidence
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/justice/evidence/) of both sides and
to the submissions of the [ barristers
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/justice/courtroom/barristers/) (or [
solicitors
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/justice/courtroom/solicitors/) ). The
judge may ask questions of any [ witness
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/justice/witnesses/) and of the
barristers (or solicitors).

The judge may give the judgment in the case at the end of the trial or they
may "reserve" the judgment. When a judgment is reserved, the judge will take
time to consider the case and then at some later stage deliver the judgment.

###  **If there is a jury**

If there is a jury in the case, it is usually the jury that decides the
outcome of the case.

The judge provides guidance to the jury and makes sure that the trial is run
properly. The jury in a [ criminal trial
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/justice/criminal-law/criminal-
trial/criminal-trial/) has the very important function of deciding whether the
person accused of the crime is guilty or not guilty.

You can read more about the [ role of the jury
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/justice/courtroom/jury/) in the
courtroom.

##  Appointment of judges

Judges in Ireland are appointed by the [ President
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/government-in-ireland/houses-of-the-
oireachtas/president-introduction-to-the-president-of-ireland/) acting on the
advice of the Government.

At present, the Government, in most cases, decides who to appoint as a judge
after it has been advised by the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board. This
Board identifies and informs the Government about suitable barristers and
solicitors who have applied for the job.

The [ Judicial Appointments Advisory Board ](http://www.jaab.ie/) was
established by law under Section 13 of the [ Court and Court Officers Act 1995
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1995/en/act/pub/0031/index.html) .

Membership of the Judicial Appointments Board consists of:

  * The Chief Justice 
  * President of the Court of Appeal 
  * President of the High Court 
  * President of the Circuit Court 
  * President of the District Court 
  * The [ Attorney General ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/government-in-ireland/national-government/the-irish-government/the-attorney-general/)
  * A practicing barrister, solicitor and 3 Ministerial appointments 

####  The Judicial Appointments Commission Act 2023

The Judicial Appointments Commission Act 2023, when fully commenced, [ will
reform how judges are appointed ](https://www.gov.ie/en/press-
release/62282-minister-mcentee-welcomes-the-passage-of-bill-giving-effect-to-
major-reforms-in-how-judges-are-appointed/) . The Judicial Appointments
Advisory Board will be replaced by a new body, the Judicial Appointments
Commission.

###  **Experience needed to become a judge**

Judges must have at least 10 years’ experience as a barrister or solicitor
before being appointed to the District Court and at least 12 years’ experience
before being appointed to the High Court, Court of Appeal or the Supreme
Court. Usually, they have many more years of experience before they are
appointed.

###  **The Courts Act 2023**

The [ Courts Act 2023
](https://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2023/act/12/enacted/en/print.html) was
drafted so that more judges could be appointed to courts in Ireland. Under the
Act, [ 44 additional judges will be appointed ](https://www.gov.ie/en/press-
release/3f48a-minister-of-state-announces-passing-of-the-courts-
bill-2023-through-the-houses-of-the-oireachtas/) by the end of 2024.

##  Complaints about judges

If you are not satisfied with the outcome or judgment of a criminal trial or
civil action, you should get legal advice. You may be able to appeal a
judgment to a higher court.

###  **Who can complain?**

Complaints about the conduct of a judge can be made to the [ Judicial Council
](https://judicialcouncil.ie/judicial-conduct-committee/) . You cannot
complain to the Judicial Council about the outcome of your case.

You can complain to the Judicial Council if you:

  * Were directly affected by the alleged misconduct 
  * Witnessed the alleged misconduct 

You can complain about the conduct of a judge on behalf of:

  * A child, if you are their parent or guardian 
  * An incapacitated person, if you have legal authorisation 

An authorised officer of the Bar Council of Ireland can make a complaint on
behalf of a barrister, and an authorised officer of the Law Society of Ireland
can make a complaint on behalf of a solicitor.

###  **Time limits for complaints**

You must make the complaint within 3 months of the alleged misconduct. The
time limit may be extended if the Judicial Council decides that there are good
reasons for doing so.

###  **How to complain**

You can make a complaint online by completing the [ online complaint form
](https://judicialcouncil.ie/make-a-complaint/) on the Judicial Council’s
website.

You can also fill out a [ complaint form (pdf)
](https://judicialcouncil.ie/assets/uploads/documents/Complaint%20Form.pdf)
and post it to the Registrar to the Judicial Conduct Committee (see ‘Contacts’
below).

You can read more about how complaints are handled and the types of outcomes
you can expect on the [ Judicial Council’s website.
](https://judicialcouncil.ie/judicial-conduct-committee/)

##  Judicial assistant

Judges appointed after 2011 are [ assigned a judicial assistant
](https://aji.ie/supports/judicial-assistants-researchers/) rather than a
tipstaff or crier.

Some judicial assistants are assigned to the work directly with judges of the
Supreme Court, Court of Appeal, High Court and Circuit Court.

Assistants assigned to specific judges assist the judge with:

  * Research 
  * Preparing for cases 
  * Proof-reading 
  * Communicating with the parties to a case 

They also combine the role of judicial assistant with that of the traditional
tipstaff or crier.

There are still a small number of tipstaff who usually work with judges
appointed up to 2011.

###  **Judicial Research Office**

Other judicial assistants are assigned to the [ Judicial Research Office (JRO)
](https://aji.ie/supports/judicial-assistants-researchers/) , where they are
made available to judges without a designated judicial assistant.

The JRO completes research, prepares material for publication, compiles
handbooks, and proof-reads judgments and other documents for judges across all
jurisdictions.
