#  Charter of Fundamental Rights

  * Introduction 
  * Contents of the Charter 
  * The Charter and national law 
  * The Charter and the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) 
  * Further information 

##  Introduction

The Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union brings together the
most important personal freedoms and rights enjoyed by citizens of the EU into
one legally binding document. The Charter was declared in 2000, and came into
force in December 2009 along with the Treaty of Lisbon.

The purpose of the Charter is to promote human rights within the territory of
the EU. Many of the rights that are contained in the Charter were previously
set out in:

  * The EU Treaties 
  * The European Convention on Human Rights 
  * Case law of the Court of Justice of the European Union 
  * National constitutions (for example, the [ Constitution of Ireland ](/en/government-in-ireland/irish-constitution-1/constitution-fundamental-rights/) ) 

The Charter has the same legal power as an EU Treaty. This means that it is
superior to Irish domestic law. However, it only applies when Irish bodies
(particularly the Irish Government) are implementing [ European Union law
](/en/government-in-ireland/european-government/eu-law/how-eu-law-works/) .  

##  Contents of the Charter

The Convention is divided into chapters and articles. The 6 chapters are:

  * Dignity 
  * Freedoms

  * Citizen’s rights 
  * Justice

**Article 50** : Right not to be tried or punished twice in criminal
proceedings for the same criminal offence.

##  The Charter and national law

The Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union applies directly to
Ireland. When the Irish government is implementing an EU law, it must do so in
accordance to the rights contained in the Charter.

In Ireland, examples of when the Charter may be relevant include if:

  * The Oireachtas is legislating to transpose an EU Directive. EU Directives are [ EU laws ](/en/government-in-ireland/european-government/eu-law/european-laws#l66355) that only come into effect when corresponding laws are passed by the national parliament. This means that each member state may interpret some aspects of the Directive differently, or might fail to correctly transpose the central laws of the Directive. 
  * A [ European Arrest Warrant ](/en/justice/arrests/extradition-to-and-from-ireland/) is executed. 
  * A benefit or health service is applied for that is based on a person’s status as an EU worker. 
  * The right to [ free movement ](/en/government-in-ireland/european-government/european-union/freedom-of-movement-in-the-eu/) is involved. 

If an EU law is disobeyed in Ireland in a way that interferes with the rights
of citizens as set out in the Charter, this could be dealt with by:

  * The [ European Commission ](/en/government-in-ireland/european-government/eu-institutions/european-commission/) referring the matter to the [ Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU). ](/en/government-in-ireland/european-government/eu-institutions/european-court-of-justice/)
  * A citizen referring the matter to the courts in Ireland, and to the CJEU if necessary. 

##  The Charter and the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR)

The European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) was signed in 1950. It was
proclaimed by the Council of Europe, and is overseen by the European Court of
Human Rights in Strasbourg.

Ireland is a founding member of the Council of Europe and signed the ECHR. But
the ECHR only became part of Irish law when the Oireachtas passed the [
European Convention on Human Rights Act 2003
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2003/act/20/enacted/en/print.html) . This
is because the ECHR does not have a direct effect in Irish law.

All of the ECHR rights are included in the Charter. The Charter however
addresses some modern issues that are not included in the ECHR (for example,
human cloning, data protection).

The box below outlines some of the similarities and differences between the
Charter and the ECHR:

|  **European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR)** |  **Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union**  
---|---|---  
First proclaimed  |  1950 by the Council of Europe  |  2000 by the European Union   
Came into effect in Ireland  |  European Convention of Human Rights Act 2003. Before this, the ECHR and the decisions of the European Court of Human Rights were not binding in Ireland but were referred to by the courts.  |  In December 2009 along with the Treaty of Lisbon. The Charter has the same legal status as an EU treaty and therefore has direct effect in certain areas.   
When is it applied in Ireland?  |  Irish law must be compatible with the ECHR. This applies when laws are being written or changed and when the courts are interpreting Irish laws.  Every government department, local authority and public institution must perform its duties in a way that satisfies Ireland’s obligations under the ECHR.  |  The Oireachtas must consider the Charter when _transposing_ EU directives into Irish law, or passing legislation following an EU decision or regulation.  For citizens, the Charter only applies where the case involves EU law.   
Court  |  [ The European Court of Human Rights ](https://echr.coe.int/Pages/home.aspx?p=home) in Strasbourg  |  [ The Court of Justice of the European Union ](https://europa.eu/european-union/about-eu/institutions-bodies/court-justice_en) in Luxembourg
