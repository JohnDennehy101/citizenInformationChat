#  Inspector of Mental Health Services

  * Introduction 
  * Mental health inspector's role and powers 
  * Make a complaint about mental health services 
  * Further information 

##  Introduction

The Inspector of Mental Health Services carries out inspections of mental
health facilities.

The inspector is a consultant psychiatrist and is appointed by the [ Mental
Health Commission ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/health/health-
services/mental-health/mental-health-commission/) as set out by the [ Mental
Health Act 2001 ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/health/health-
services/mental-health/mental-health-act-2001/) .

The Office of Inspector of Mental Health Services is made up of:

  * The Inspector of Mental Health Services 
  * A team of assistant inspectors 

The assistant inspectors are [ professionals ](/en/health/health-
services/mental-health/mental-health-professionals/) from a range of
backgrounds including nursing, social work, psychiatry, occupational therapy
and clinical psychology.

##  Mental health inspector's role and powers

The Inspector's job is to :

  * Visit and inspect every approved centre at least once a year. - Approved centres are hospitals or in-patient facilities for the treatment of mental illness or disorder. 
  * Review the quality and safety of mental health services every year 
  * Report to the Mental Health Commission (MHC) on the quality of care and treatment given to people getting mental health services and on other aspects of the services 

The Inspector has a range of powers including the ability to:

  * Enter and inspect mental health facilities 
  * Obtain records, documentation and other information from staff 
  * Take evidence from staff under oath relating to the inspection 
  * Speak to anyone they believe may have relevant information for the inspection 

The Mental Health Commission may ask the inspector to carry out an inquiry
into:

  * Any [ approved mental health centre ](https://www.mhcirl.ie/what-we-do/regulation/approved-centres) or any premises where mental health services are provided 
  * The care and treatment provided to a specified patient who may be a [ voluntary or involuntary patient ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/health/health-services/mental-health/admission-to-a-psychiatric-hospital/)
  * Any other appropriate matter 

You can find [ summaries of inspection reports ](https://www.mhcirl.ie/what-
we-do/regulation/regulatory-activity-and-oversight-reports) on mhrcirl.ie.

##  Make a complaint about mental health services

If you have a complaint about a mental health service, you should first
contact the service provider.

Each provider must have a clear complaints procedure under Article 31 of the [
Mental Health Act 2001 (Approved Centres) Regulations 2006
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2006/si/551/made/en/print) .

You can find more information on [ making a complaint about a health service
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/health/health-system/making-a-
complaint-about-the-health-service-executive/) .

The Mental Health Commission does not have the power to investigate
complaints. If you raise a concern with the MHC, it may direct you to the [
Inspector of Mental Health Services
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/health/health-services/mental-
health/inspector-of-mental-health-services/) if appropriate.

The Inspectorate logs all concerns about mental health services. These are
taken into account when making inspections.
