##  Introduction

If you break a rule of the road, you may commit a driving offence. Driving
offences in Ireland are set out in the [ Road Traffic Acts 1961 (as amended)
](https://revisedacts.lawreform.ie/eli/1961/act/24/front/revised/en/html) .

Driving offences have different penalties, which depend on the seriousness of
the offence, and sometimes, on how many offences you have committed in the
past.

Driving offences have different penalties, which depend on the seriousness of
the offence, and sometimes, on how many offences you have committed in the
past.

Penalties range from fixed charges, which are fines that you must pay, to
imprisonment for the most serious offences. If you are sent a fixed charge
notice and you fail to pay the charge on time, you will be summoned to appear
in court.

Ireland also uses a [ penalty points ](/en/travel-and-
recreation/motoring/driving-offences/penalty-points-for-driving-offences/)
system for driving offences.

Gardaí have the power to arrest you for some driving offences, such as drink
driving or dangerous driving.

You will also be [ disqualified from driving ](/en/travel-and-
recreation/motoring/driving-offences/being-disqualified-from-driving/) if you
commit an offence and a judge decides to disqualify you from driving, or if
you have [ 12 penalty points on your licence ](/en/travel-and-
recreation/motoring/driving-offences/penalty-points-for-driving-offences/) .

**New Garda roadside technology**

Since 24 May 2024, the Gardaí have mobility devices to do a roadside [ check
if a vehicle is insured ](https://www.gov.ie/en/press-release/2827c-minister-
mcentee-and-minister-richmond-attend-launch-of-irish-motor-insurance-
database/) on the Irish Motor Insurance Database. The Gardaí can also check if
a vehicle is taxed or if the driver is disqualified, using mobility devices at
the roadside.

##  Licence offences

You must have a driving licence to drive in Ireland. You can read more about:

  * [ How to apply for a learner permit to drive a car ](/en/travel-and-recreation/motoring/driver-licensing/learner-driving-permits-for-cars-and-work-vehicles/)
  * [ Applying for a driving licence ](/en/travel-and-recreation/motoring/driver-licensing/full-driving-licence/)
  * [ Driving tests in Ireland ](/en/travel-and-recreation/motoring/driving-tests/driving-test/)

Several driving offences relate to licences and driving with the right
licence.

###  Driving without a licence

It is an [ offence to drive without a licence
](https://www.lawreform.ie/_fileupload/RevisedActs/WithAnnotations/HTML/EN_ACT_1961_0024.htm#SEC38)
. A Garda can ask you to produce your driving licence for inspection. If you
do not have your driving licence with you, you must bring it to a Garda
station for inspection within 10 days. If you refuse to give the Garda your
name and address, the [ Garda has the power to arrest you
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2010/act/25/section/59/enacted/en/html#sec59)
.

If you don’t have a current licence, and your driving licence expired less
than 12 months before the offence took place, you could be fined up to €1000.
If it was more than 12 months since your licence was valid (or if you never
had a valid licence), you could be fined up to €2000.

If you drive while disqualified from driving, or you are required to produce a
certificate of competency or certificate of fitness before getting a driving
licence but you fail to do so, you could be fined up to €5000, or be
imprisoned for up to 6 months, or both.

###  Learner and novice drivers

If you hold a [ learner permit ](/en/travel-and-recreation/motoring/driver-
licensing/learner-driving-permits-for-cars-and-work-vehicles/) , you must be
accompanied by a driver who has had a full driving licence for at least the
last 2 years. If you drive unaccompanied, you are committing an offence. This
offence carries an initial €160 fine and 2 penalty points. If you do not pay
the fine within 28 days, the fine increases first to €240. If you do not pay
the fine and are summoned to court, you could be fined even more and get 4
penalty points.

The Gardaí have the power to [ seize the car you are driving
](http://revisedacts.lawreform.ie/eli/1994/act/7/section/41/revised/en/html) ,
even if it belongs to someone else. If you allow a learner driver to drive
your car unaccompanied, you could be fined up to €1000.

If you are a [ learner motorcyclist ](/en/travel-and-
recreation/motoring/driver-licensing/learner-driving-permits-for-cars-and-
work-vehicles/) , you do not have to be accompanied at all times. But you
cannot drive your motorcycle unaccompanied until you have completed your
Initial Basic Training.

All learner drivers (except in category W, which includes motorcycles) must
display ‘L’ plates. When you have passed your driving test, you must display
an ‘N’ plate for 2 years. Failure to properly display the L or N plate is an
offence. You could get 2 penalty points and an initial fixed charge fine of
€120, which increases to €180 if not paid within 28 days. If you are convicted
in court, you could be fined a higher amount and will get 4 penalty points.

##  Failing to display insurance or tax

The Gardaí have the power to impound your vehicle if you drive without tax or
insurance.

###  Insurance

You must have motor insurance to drive a car in your own name or as a named
driver on someone else's policy. If a Garda asks for your insurance
certificate, you must provide it within 7 days. Offences for driving without
insurance are prosecuted in court. Failure to display an insurance disk
carries an initial fixed charge of €60 (rising to €90 after 28 days).

If you drive while uninsured, you could be fined up to €5000 and get 5 penalty
points. You could also go to prison for up to 6 months. The judge may decide
to disqualify you from driving instead of giving you penalty points. You can
read more in our page on ‘ [ Motor insurance’ ](/en/travel-and-
recreation/motoring/motor-tax-and-insurance/motor-insurance/) .

###  Tax

It is an offence to drive an untaxed vehicle and it is an offence to drive
without displaying a current tax disc. You can read more in our page on ‘ [
Motor tax ](/en/travel-and-recreation/motoring/motor-tax-and-insurance/motor-
tax-rates/) ’.

##  Speeding offences

It is an offence to [ drive over the speed limit
](https://www.lawreform.ie/_fileupload/RevisedActs/WithAnnotations/HTML/EN_ACT_1961_0024.htm#SEC47)
. Our page on [ speed limits in Ireland ](/en/travel-and-recreation/roads-and-
safety/road-traffic-speed-limits-in-ireland/) describes the different speed
limits in operation.

If you drive over the speed limit, you will get 3 penalty points and a fixed
charge fine of €160. If you do not pay the fine within 28 days, it increases
to €240. If you do not pay this within 28 days (56 days from the original fine
notification date), you will be summonsed to court where, if convicted, you
could be fined up to €1000 and receive up to 5 penalty points.

You can avoid going to court by paying €320 (twice the sum of the original
fine) no later than 7 days before the court date specified in the summons.

##  Careless and dangerous driving offences

###  Careless driving

It is an offence to [ drive in a public place without due care and attention
](https://www.lawreform.ie/_fileupload/RevisedActs/WithAnnotations/HTML/EN_ACT_1961_0024.htm#SEC52)
. If a Garda believes that you have driven carelessly, but no accident
resulted, the Garda can issue you with 2 penalty points and an €80 fixed
charge for “driving without reasonable consideration”. This rises to €120 if
not paid within 28 days. If you are convicted in court, you could be fined a
higher amount and will get 4 penalty points.

There are a number of other offences based on disobeying road signs, or acting
carelessly, and these mainly attract penalty points and fixed charge notices.
Examples include failure to yield, breaking traffic lights, and failing to
stop at a junction. You can read a [ full list of penalty points offences on
rsa.ie ](https://www.rsa.ie/services/licensed-drivers/penalty-points/types-of-
offences) .

If the offence is more serious, you could be convicted of careless driving and
fined up to €5000. If you are convicted of **careless driving causing death or
serious bodily harm** , you could be fined up to €10,000 and imprisoned for up
to 2 years, or both.

###  Dangerous driving

It is an [ offence to drive dangerously
](https://www.lawreform.ie/_fileupload/RevisedActs/WithAnnotations/HTML/EN_ACT_1961_0024.htm#SEC52)
in a public place. If you are convicted of dangerous driving, you could be
fined up to €5000, or be sent to prison for up to 6 months, or both. If you
are convicted of **dangerous driving causing death or serious bodily harm** ,
you could be fined up to €20,000 and imprisoned for up to 10 years, or both.

##  Using your mobile phone while driving

It is an offence to hold a mobile phone in your hand, or to support it with
another part of your body (for example, between your head and shoulder), while
driving. The only exception is if you are calling emergency services on 999 or
112.

It is an offence to access information on your phone while you are driving,
even if your phone is secured into a hands-free system. You can legally talk
on your phone using a hands-free system, but the Road Safety Authority advises
very strongly against this.

The penalty for using your phone while driving is a fixed charge of €120, and
3 penalty points. This increases to a fixed charge of €180 after 28 days, and
5 penalty points and a more significant fine can be imposed if it goes to
court because of non-payment.

##  Drink or drug driving offences

It is an [ offence to drive in a public place if you are too intoxicated
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2010/act/25/enacted/en/print#sec4) to
have proper control of your vehicle. An intoxicant can be either alcohol or
drugs, or both.

Since 31 May 2024, [ if you are a driver that has been involved in a serious
car collision, the Gardaí must test you for drugs at the roadside
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/travel-and-
recreation/motoring/driving-offences/drink-driving-offences-in-
ireland/#e9b963) .

Gardaí can set up a roadblock to conduct random alcohol and drug testing. It
is unlawful to refuse to be breathalysed, and you could be fined up to €5000,
or be imprisoned for up to 6 months, or both.

Alcohol limits

You commit an offence if an alcohol test taken within 3 hours of driving finds
that you have above the following:

  * 50 milligrams (or 20 milligrams for learner or novice drivers) of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood, or 
  * 67 milligrams (or 27 milligrams for learner or novice drivers) of alcohol in 100 millilitres of urine, or 
  * 22 micrograms (or 9 micrograms for learner or novice drivers) of alcohol in 100 millilitres of breath 

The maximum penalty for drink or drug driving is a €5000 fine and/or
imprisonment for up to 6 months. All drink driving offences result in [
disqualification from driving ](/en/travel-and-recreation/motoring/driving-
offences/being-disqualified-from-driving/) for at least 3 months.

You can read more about [ penalties for drink driving offences ](/en/travel-
and-recreation/motoring/driving-offences/drink-driving-offences-in-ireland/) .

##  Parking offences

It is an offence [ to park your car in a place where it could be dangerous
](https://www.lawreform.ie/_fileupload/RevisedActs/WithAnnotations/HTML/EN_ACT_1961_0024.htm#SEC55)
to other people. You can get 3 penalty points and a fixed charge fine of €80
for this offence. If you do not pay within 28 days, the fine increases to
€120. If convicted in court, you could receive a fine of up to €2500 for a
first offence, or up to €4000 if it is not your first offence under this law.

You can avoid going to court by paying €160 (twice the sum of the original
fine) no later than 7 days before the court date specified in the summons.

It is an offence to park in a disabled parking bay unless you have a disabled
parking badge. The penalty for this offence is a fixed charge fine of €150
(increasing to €225 if you do not pay within 28 days). Some city and county
councils clamp vehicles that are parked illegally in disabled parking bays.

Since 1 January 2023, the fixed charge amount for misusing a disabled parking
badge is €200 (increasing to €300 if you do not pay within 28 days).

The fixed charge amount for illegally parking in an electric charging bay is
€80.

A system of [ parking restrictions and fines ](/en/travel-and-
recreation/traffic-and-parking/parking-fines-and-vehicle-clamping/) is also in
place throughout Ireland.

##  Roadworthiness of vehicle

There are a number of offences based on the roadworthiness of your vehicle.

**Dangerously defective vehicles**

If you [ drive a “dangerously defective” vehicle
](https://www.lawreform.ie/_fileupload/RevisedActs/WithAnnotations/HTML/EN_ACT_1961_0024.htm#SEC54)
in a public place you are committing an offence. Dangerously defective means
that the vehicle is a danger to the public because of its condition. The
penalty for this offence is a fine of up to €5000 and/or imprisonment of up to
3 months.

###  Vehicles with defective or worn tyres

It is an offence to drive a vehicle in a public place with defective or worn
tyres. The initial fixed charge amount is €80 (increasing to €120 if you do
not pay within 28 days) and you will also get 2 penalty points. 4 penalty
points and a more significant fine can be imposed if it goes to court because
of non-payment.

**National Car Test (NCT)**

It is an offence to drive a vehicle in a public place [ without a current NCT
certificate ](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2004/si/771/made/en/print) .
This applies to vehicles from the fourth anniversary of their first
registration. The initial fixed charge amount is €60 (increasing to €90 if you
do not pay within 28 days) and you will also get 3 penalty points. 5 penalty
points and a more significant fine and/or imprisonment can be imposed if it
goes to court because of non-payment.

**Certificate of roadworthiness**

If you are driving a vehicle that has 8 passenger seats or more, or you drive
a goods vehicle, goods trailer or ambulance, you [ must have a certificate of
roadworthiness ](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2004/si/771/made/en/print)
. If you cannot produce one within 10 days of being requested to do so by the
Gardaí, you are guilty of an offence.

##  Fitness to drive

It is an offence to drive in public if you know that you are medically unfit
to do so.

Drivers who are 75 years or over and drivers who have [ certain medical
conditions ](https://www.ndls.ie/medical-reports.html#specified-diseases-and-
disabilities-which-need-to-be-reported-on-application-for-or-renewal-of-a-
driver-licence) must have a fitness to drive certificate signed by their GP.
In some cases, a GP may decide that you are unfit to drive, or the NDLS may
decide that you are unfit to drive. If this is the case, you will be refused a
licence. You can appeal this decision.

You can get more information about fitness to drive from the [ Road Safety
Authority ](https://www.rsa.ie/services/licensed-drivers/medical-fitness) .

##  Other offences

The fixed charge amount for breaching an HGV ban and entering a specified
public road without a permit is €200.

You can read more in our pages on:

  * [ Drink driving offences ](/en/travel-and-recreation/motoring/driving-offences/drink-driving-offences-in-ireland/)
  * [ Penalty points for driving offences ](/en/travel-and-recreation/motoring/driving-offences/penalty-points-for-driving-offences/)
  * [ Motor accidents ](/en/travel-and-recreation/motoring/motor-accidents/) (describes what you must do by law) 
  * [ National speed limits ](/en/travel-and-recreation/roads-and-safety/road-traffic-speed-limits-in-ireland/)
  * [ Seat belts and the law ](/en/travel-and-recreation/roads-and-safety/seatbelts-when-motoring-in-ireland/)
  * [ Parking fees, fines and vehicle clamping ](/en/travel-and-recreation/traffic-and-parking/parking-fines-and-vehicle-clamping/)

You can [ read a list of other offences that carry penalty points, or offences
that carry a fixed charge only on the website of the Road Safety Authority
](https://www.rsa.ie/services/licensed-drivers/penalty-points/types-of-
offences) .

##  Can I appeal against a motoring penalty?

How you appeal against a decision to penalise you for a motor offence depends
on the type of penalty you have received.

**Penalty points and fixed charge notices**

If you have been issued with a fixed charge notice (with penalty points or
not) you can apply to the Gardaí for the charge to be cancelled. You must show
that there are good procedural or exceptional grounds for cancelling the
charge. You can get more information on appeals against penalty points and
fixed charge notices in our page on [ penalty points for driving offences
](/en/travel-and-recreation/motoring/driving-offences/penalty-points-for-
driving-offences/) .

**Appealing a court conviction**

If you choose not to pay a fixed charge notice within 56 days, you are issued
with a summons to appear in the District Court. Some motor offences can only
be prosecuted in court (for example, driving without insurance and dangerous
driving). The most serious motor offences are heard in the Circuit Court, for
example dangerous driving causing death.

If you are convicted of a motor offence in the District Court, you can appeal
the decision to the Circuit Court. This includes appealing against a decision
to disqualify you from driving by the District Court. You should get legal
advice if you are planning an appeal. You can get free legal advice from [
Free Legal Advice Centres (FLAC) ](https://www.flac.ie/help/centres/) .

You must lodge an appeal within 14 days of your conviction. If you want to
represent yourself, you can ask the court clerk in your local District Court
for help with the forms you need to complete. Alternatively, a solicitor can
help you.

##  Removal of a disqualification

If you have been [ disqualified from driving ](/en/travel-and-
recreation/motoring/driving-offences/being-disqualified-from-driving/) , you
can apply for your driving licence to be restored. You make the application to
the District Court where the order to disqualify you was made. An application
costs €55. You must be more than halfway through your disqualification period
before you can make an application.

Your driving licence will not be restored if:

  * The disqualification is for 2 years or less 
  * You have been given another disqualification in the past 10 years 

The court can reduce the period of disqualification to two-thirds of the
original period of disqualification or to 2 years, whichever is the greater.

You can get further information and the forms you need from the District Court
clerk.

##  Other driving offence questions

###  What happens if I commit a driving offence abroad?

Penalty points and endorsements on driving licences received in other
countries (including EU/EEA member states) do not transfer between states.

This means that if you got penalty points abroad or already have endorsements
on your driving licence before coming to Ireland, these penalty points or
endorsements will not transfer over to an Irish driving licence.

If, however, you have been disqualified from driving in another country and
this was **in addition to a prison sentence** for driving offences it may not
be possible for you to [ exchange your full foreign driving licence
](/en/travel-and-recreation/motoring/driver-licensing/exchanging-foreign-
driving-permit/) for a full driving licence here in Ireland.

The situation is different between Ireland and the UK (including Northern
Ireland) for [ driving disqualifications for specified offences
](https://www.rsa.ie/services/licensed-drivers/mutual-recognition-of-
disqualifications-ireland-and-uk) . This is provided for by [ Section 40 of
the Road Traffic Act 2016
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2016/act/21/section/40/enacted/en/html#sec40)
, which came into operation from 1 August 2017.

Under this agreement between Ireland and the UK, if you hold an Irish licence
and you are disqualified from driving for committing a serious offence in the
UK, you may also be disqualified from driving in Ireland. The District Court
can make an order to disqualify you from driving in Ireland for the offence
that was committed in the UK. The same rules apply if you are driving in
Ireland on an UK licence, although the UK authorities can disqualify you
without taking separate court action.

###  What happens if I am driving on a foreign licence in Ireland?

Penalty points and other penalties work the same way if you are driving on a
foreign driving licence. See our page on [ penalty points for driving offences
](/en/travel-and-recreation/motoring/driving-offences/penalty-points-for-
driving-offences/) for more information.

If you are driving in Ireland on a UK licence and you are disqualified from
driving in Ireland, you may also be disqualified from driving in the UK. See
‘What happens if I commit a driving offence abroad?’ above for more
information.

###  Can I get a copy of my driving licence record?

To request a copy of your driving record you will need to contact NDLS at 0818
700 800 or email [ info@ndls.ie ](mailto:info@ndls.ie) for a Letter of
Entitlement or Driver Statement. There is no fee payable.

##  Useful contacts

Contact information for your local District Court and contact information for
your local Circuit Court is located at the front of all public telephone
directories and on the Courts Service website.
