##  Introduction

Living together with someone is also sometimes called ‘cohabitation’. If you
have been living in an intimate and committed relationship with your partner
and your relationship ends, you may qualify for the ‘redress scheme for
cohabiting couples’. The aim of the redress scheme is to provide a legal
safety net for a financially dependent member of the couple if the long-term
cohabiting relationship ends (either through death or separation).

Under the redress scheme, cohabiting couples can get similar types of orders
from the court as are available to married couples when they separate or
divorce (for example, a ‘maintenance order’ or ‘property adjustment order’).

The rules of the scheme are set out in the [ Civil Partnership and Certain
Rights and Obligations of Cohabitants Act 2010
](https://www.lawreform.ie/_fileupload/RevisedActs/WithAnnotations/HTML/en_act_2010_0024.htm)
.

##  What are cohabitants?

Cohabitants are 2 adults of the same sex or opposite sex who are:

  * Not married to each other and not in a registered civil partnership 
  * Not [ related within the prohibited degrees of relationship ](../getting_married/legal_prerequisites_for_marriage.en.html#l3b8db) . Certain people related by blood or marriage cannot get married. 
  * Living together in an intimate and committed relationship 

###  What are 'qualified' cohabitants?

To apply for court orders under the redress scheme, you must be a _qualified
cohabitant_ . This means you must have been:

  * A cohabitant (living together in an intimate and committed relationship) for at least 5 years, or 
  * A cohabitant (living together in an intimate and committed relationship) for 2 years if you have had a child with your partner 

##  Applying for redress from the court

If you are a qualified cohabitant and you were financially dependent on your
former partner, you can apply to the court for court orders, such as:

  * A maintenance order 
  * Property adjustment order 
  * Pension adjustment order 

You do not have an automatic right to get these orders granted. Instead, the
court must be satisfied that you were financially dependent on your cohabitant
partner.

###  What the court will consider

When making a decision, the court must consider a number of factors,
including:

  * The financial circumstances, needs and obligations of you and your former partner 
  * The rights of others (including the rights of spouses, former spouses, civil partners, former civil partners and dependent children of either partner) 
  * The length and nature of the relationship 
  * The contributions made by each of you, financial and otherwise 

Court orders may not affect the rights of spouses or former spouses. They may
affect the rights of civil partners or former civil partners.

###  Time limits when applying for court orders under the redress scheme

In general, you must apply for court orders within 2 years of the end of your
relationship.

Orders can lapse and may not be available if you get married.

##  Redress orders and tax

If you are granted certain court orders under the redress scheme, you may have
tax obligations.

####  Maintenance orders and tax

Any maintenance payment ordered by the court is treated as your income. This
means you have to pay tax on it.

The amount of the maintenance payment is allowed as a deduction from the
income of your former partner. You can read more in our page on [ maintenance
and tax ](/en/money-and-tax/tax/income-tax-credits-and-reliefs/maintenance-
and-tax/) .

####  Property adjustment orders and tax

Where a property adjustment order is made, there are no [ capital gains tax
](/en/money-and-tax/tax/capital-taxes/capital-gains-tax/) , [ gift or
inheritance tax ](/en/money-and-tax/tax/capital-taxes/capital-acquisitions-
tax/) issues for either you or your former partner on the transfer, and no
stamp duty is payable.

However, when the property is disposed of at a later date, the total period of
ownership of the property (by both of you) is taken into consideration for the
purposes of determining whether any capital gains tax is payable.

##  Application for provision from the estate of a deceased partner

If you are in cohabitating relationship and your partner dies, you can apply
for provisions to be made for you from their estate. The court may grant a
share of the estate to you if proper provision was not made for you in your
deceased partner’s lifetime or in a bequest in their will. It is not necessary
to prove that you were financially dependent on them.

You must notify the personal representative of the deceased of your
application for provision from the deceased’s estate within 6 months of [ an
application for a grant of probate
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/death/the-deceaseds-estate/dealing-
with-the-deceaseds-estate/) .

In general, if your cohabiting relationship ended two years or more before
your ex-partner died, you cannot apply for provision from the estate unless
you were getting regular or periodic payments from the deceased.

##  What is a cohabitation agreement?

If you live with your partner but you do not intend to marry, you should
protect your financial interests by entering into a ‘ _cohabitation agreement_
’ (also called a cohabitant’s agreement). This is a voluntary, signed
agreement, which allows you to specify the day-to-day joint financial
arrangements of your relationship, such as:

  * The payment of joint debts 
  * The payment of common household expenses 

You can also specify how you plan to separate your assets, such as shared
property, should the relationship come to an end. In the event of a break-up,
a cohabitation agreement can make the division of your assets more
straightforward.

Your cohabitation agreement may include a provision that the redress scheme
does not apply to you (for example, you can both agree not to apply for a
maintenance order should your relationship end). This is different from
similar agreements by married couples. Agreements between married couples
cannot exclude either party’s right to apply to the courts for various orders
(for example, a maintenance order).

###  Is a cohabitation agreement valid in court?

If you and your partner make a cohabitation agreement (an agreement on joint
financial matters), it is only valid if:

  * Each of you has had independent legal advice, or you got legal advice together and have waived the right to independent legal advice (see ‘More information’ below) 
  * The agreement is a contract 
  * The agreement has been signed by each of you 

In exceptional circumstances, the court may set aside or vary (change) your
cohabitation agreement (for example, if the enforcement of the agreement would
cause serious injustice).

If you and your cohabitant entered into an agreement before the 2010 Act
commenced, it is enforceable.

##  More information

If you are concerned about your rights following the breakdown of your
cohabiting relationship, you should get legal advice.
