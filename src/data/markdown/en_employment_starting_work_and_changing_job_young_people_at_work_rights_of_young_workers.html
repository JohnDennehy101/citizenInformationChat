##  Who are ‘young workers’?

If you are between 14 and 18 and you work for an employer, you are a ‘young
worker’ entitled to certain rights and protections.

The law sets out different rules for young workers, depending on your age.
Workers aged 14 and 15 are classed as ‘children’. Workers aged 16 and 17 are
classed as ‘young persons’.

###  Proof of age and written permission from parents

Before starting a job, young workers must provide proof of age, such as a
birth certificate.

Those under 16 also need written permission from a parent or guardian, which
must be given to the employer.

The law on young workers is set out in the [ Protection of Young Persons
(Employment) Act 1996
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1996/en/act/pub/0016/index.html) .

Read more about [ working hours and rest breaks for children and young people
](/en/employment/starting-work-and-changing-job/young-people-at-work/working-
hours-rest-breaks-young-people/) .

##  Employment rights for young workers

###  **Basic employment rights and entitlements**

In most cases, young workers have the same [ employment rights and
entitlements ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/employment/employment-
rights-and-conditions/employment-rights-and-duties/employee-rights-and-
entitlements/) as other employees. For example, they have a [ right to basic
information about their terms of employment
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/employment/employment-rights-and-
conditions/contracts-of-employment/contract-of-employment/) and entitlements
to [ annual leave
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/employment/employment-rights-and-
conditions/leave-and-holidays/annual-leave/) and benefit for [ public holidays
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/employment/employment-rights-and-
conditions/leave-and-holidays/public-holidays/) .

###  **Extra protections for young workers**

Because young workers usually balance work with education, they are protected
by extra employment laws than adults. This is to make sure their work does not
put their health or education at risk.

For example, the law for young workers:

  * Sets minimum age limits for employment 
  * Sets maximum working hours 
  * Bans anyone under 18 from doing late-night work 
  * Requires young workers to get specific rest periods 
  * Requires employers to keep specified records for workers under 18 

##  Restrictions on employing 14 and 15 year-olds

Children aged 14 and 15 cannot be employed in regular full-time jobs. However,
they can:

  * Do light work during the school holidays (with at least 21 days off during this time) 
  * Take part in an approved work experience or educational programme (once it is not harmful to their health, safety, or development) 
  * Work in film, cultural, advertising or sport (under certain licences) 

###  Working hours for 14 and 15 year-olds

####  Outside school term time

Children aged 14 and 15 can work a **maximum of 35 hours a week** (or up to 40
hours if they are on approved work experience).

####  During school term time

Children aged 14 are not allowed to work during school time. Children aged 15
can do **8 hours** of light work a week.

##  Restrictions on employing 16 and 17 year-olds

Young people aged 16 and 17 can work a maximum of **8 hours a day, up to 40
hours a week** .

If you are under 18 and work more than one job, the total hours you work each
day or week cannot be over the maximum allowed.

Young people are only allowed to work between **6am and 10pm** . Any
exceptions to this rule must be set out by regulations – see ‘Working in a
licensed premises' below.

###  Leaving school early for a job

If you are 16 or 17 and leave school early for a job, you must tell [ Tusla
](http://www.tusla.ie/) .

Tusla makes sure that every child either [ attends school, or gets a minimum
education ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/education/primary-and-post-
primary-education/attendance-and-discipline-in-schools/school-attendance/) .
It keeps a register of young people aged 16 and 17 who leave school early to
take up a job.

Tusla also makes arrangements for your continuing education and training in
consultation with education providers and employers.

##  Working in a licensed premises (such as a pub)

Young people who are in school can be employed on _general duties_ in a
licensed premises, such as a pub. General duties do not include selling
alcohol at the bar or in an off-licence.

During school term, you can only work until 11pm on a day that is not
immediately before a school day. For example, you can work until 11pm on
Friday night if you are not in school on Saturday. However, you cannot work
until 11pm on Sunday if you must be in school on Monday.

Employers who employ young people in a licensed premises must follow the [
Code of Practice concerning the Employment of Young Persons in Licensed
Premises (pdf).
](http://www.workplacerelations.ie/en/Publications_Forms/Code_of_Practice_-
_Employment_of_Young_Persons_in_Licensed_Premises.pdf)

The law on young workers employed in licensed premises is set out in the [
Protection of Young Persons Act 1996 (Employment in Licensed Premises)
Regulations 2001. ](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2001/en/si/0350.html)

##  Paying young people

###  Getting a payslip

All employees, regardless of age, have a right to get a payslip. A payslip is
a written statement from the employer that explains your total pay before tax,
and all details of any deductions from pay.

Find out [ what your payslip should include ](/en/employment/employment-
rights-and-conditions/pay-and-employment/pay-slip/) and [ how your tax is
calculated ](/en/money-and-tax/tax/income-tax/how-your-tax-is-calculated/) .

###  Minimum wage

Since 1 January 2024, the [ national minimum wage ](/en/employment/employment-
rights-and-conditions/pay-and-employment/minimum-wage/) is €12.70 per hour.
However, not everyone is automatically entitled to get this.

Workers under 18 are only guaranteed up to 70% of the national minimum wage,
which is €8.89 per hour. Your employer can pay you more than the minimum wage
if they want, but they are not required to do so by law.

###  Tips and gratuities

Employers must follow rules about how employers share [ tips, gratuities and
service charges ](/en/employment/employment-rights-and-conditions/pay-and-
employment/tips-gratuities-service-charges/) among employees. It is illegal
for employers to use tips or gratuities to make up basic wages.

##  Employers' responsibilities

Employers must keep records for every employee under 18, including:

  * The employee's full name 
  * The employee's date of birth 
  * The employee's starting and finishing times for work 
  * The wage rate and total wages paid to the employee. 

The employer must keep these records for at least 3 years.

###  Give young workers a summary of their rights

Employers must give employees aged under 18 a copy of the [ official summary
of the Protection of Young Persons (Employment) Act
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1997/si/3/made/en/print) , and other
details of their terms of employment, **within one month** of them taking up a
job.

Employers with employees under 18 must also display the official summary of
the Act in their workplace, where it can be easily read by staff.

###  Breaches of the Protection of Young Persons (Employment) Act

Employers who are found guilty of an offence under the Protection of Young
Persons (Employment) Act can be fined up to €1,904.61 and an extra €317.43 a
day for a continuing offence.

##  How to make a complaint

If you have a complaint about a breach of your employment rights, you should
first discuss it with your employer. If you cannot resolve your complaint, you
can make a complaint under the Protection of Young Persons (Employment) Act
1996 to the [ Workplace Relations Commission (WRC)
](/en/employment/enforcement-and-redress/enforcement-employment-rights-
legislation/) .

If you think you have been punished because you won’t break the rules (for
example, by refusing to work prohibited hours), then your parent or guardian
can [ make a complaint to the WRC ](/en/employment/enforcement-and-
redress/adjudication-employment-rights-disputes-and-complaints/) on your
behalf.

You should make the complaint within 6 months of the event, using the WRC’s [
online complaint form
](https://www.workplacerelations.ie/en/complaints_disputes/refer_a_dispute_make_a_complaint/)
.

If you need more help you can contact the [ WRC Information and Customer
Services, ](https://www.workplacerelations.ie/en/what-we-do/employment-rights-
information/info_cust_serv/) or read the WRC [ FAQ on employing children and
young people.

obligations/employment_of_children_and_young_persons/employing-children-and-
