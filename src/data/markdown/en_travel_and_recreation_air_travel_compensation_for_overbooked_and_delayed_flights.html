Compensation for overbooked, cancelled and delayed flights in the EU

#  Compensation for overbooked, cancelled and delayed flights in the EU

  * Introduction 
  * Denied boarding 
  * Cancelled flights 
  * Delayed flights 
  * Compensation 
  * Upgrading and downgrading seats 
  * How to make a complaint 

##  Introduction

Air passengers have specific consumer rights under [ European law
](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-
content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52016XC0615%2801%29) . You have a right to get
assistance from your air carrier and you may be entitled to compensation in
certain situations.

These situations are:

  * You are denied boarding against your will 
  * Your flight is cancelled 
  * Your flight is delayed 
  * You are downgraded 

###  Who does the law apply to?

The law applies to all passengers departing from an EU/EEA airport. It also
applies to passengers departing from an airport outside of the EU/EEA but
arriving at an EU/EEA airport on an EU/EEA licensed carrier (unless they have
already received compensation or assistance in that non-EU/EEA country).

###  Who does the law not apply to?

The law does not apply if you are travelling free of charge or at a fare that
is reduced and is not available directly or indirectly to the public. Tickets
purchased under frequent flyer programmes or similar commercial programmes are
not considered reduced fare tickets. The law also does not apply if you do not
have a confirmed reservation or relevant document (visa etc), if you do not
arrive at the boarding gate at a good time or if you pose safety or security
concerns.

###  Check-in (Confirming your reservation)

When you buy a ticket for air travel, you enter into an agreement with the
airline. One of the terms of this agreement is that you must confirm that you
will be ready to take the flight on the date of travel (confirming your
reservation) and you must present yourself at check-in to demonstrate that you
have a valid ticket and are ready to fly on the date on your ticket.

###  Reservation not confirmed or not checked in

If you have not confirmed your reservation in time or presented yourself for
check-in at the time specified by the airline, the law does not apply. The
airline can refuse to allow you to board the aircraft.

If you have been denied access to the aircraft in these circumstances, you are
not entitled to any compensation. The airline may, however, agree to
accommodate you on a later flight (with or without charge) if there is
availability. If you did not confirm your reservation or you did not present
yourself for check-in at the specified time, it depends on the terms and
conditions of your ticket as to whether or not you must pay again for the
flight.

###  Reservation confirmed and checked in

If you are denied boarding, or your flight has been cancelled or delayed, and
the law does apply, the airline must provide you with a written notice setting
out the rules for compensation and assistance. You must be offered 2 free
telephone calls, fax messages, or emails. In addition, a sign must be
displayed at the check-in area referring to air passenger rights under the
law.

##  Denied boarding

Denied boarding means that the airline has refused to accommodate you on
scheduled flights and charters although you have a valid ticket, correct
documentation (passport, visa etc.), you have confirmed your reservation on
your flight and you have presented yourself for check-in within the required
time limit as specified by the airline.

Denied boarding happens when airlines sell more tickets for a scheduled flight
than there are seats on the aircraft.

###  Volunteers

Where a flight is overbooked the airline will first call for volunteers to
surrender their confirmed reservations to the airline in exchange for agreed
benefits. The volunteers are also entitled to a choice of:

  * Refund the cost of their ticket within 7 days if not wishing to travel or 
  * Re-routing to their final destination at the earliest opportunity or 
  * Re-routing at a later date at the passenger’s convenience, subject to the availability of seats 

###  Non-volunteers

If there are not enough volunteers, the airline may deny boarding to
passengers against their will but must compensate them and offer the
appropriate assistance set out in the law.

You must also be offered a choice of:

  * Refund of the cost of your ticket within 7 days if not wishing to travel or 
  * Re-routing to your final destination at the earliest opportunity or 
  * Re-routing at a later date at your convenience, subject to the availability of seats 

A refund is a full refund of the ticket for the part or parts of the journey
you have not made and for the part or parts you have already made if the
flight is no longer serving any purpose to your original travel plan. When
relevant, it also includes a return flight to your first point of departure at
the earliest opportunity.

If you choose a **refund** , compensation must also be paid. The amount you
are entitled to depends on the distance of the flight that you have not been
allowed to board. See  Compensation  below.

If you choose **re-routing** , the compensation that is paid depends on the
length of delay past the original planned time in arriving at your final
destination. See  Compensation  below.

If you choose to be re-routed as soon as possible then the air carrier must
give you care and assistance whilst you are waiting on your alternative
flight.

###  What is care and assistance by the airline?

Free meals and refreshments must be offered depending on how long the waiting
time is. Hotel accommodation must also be offered free of charge where an
overnight stay becomes necessary, as well as transport between the hotel and
the airport. You must be offered 2 free telephone calls, fax messages, or
emails.

If the airline does not give you the above assistance to you and you are
forced to make your own arrangements, you should keep all your receipts. You
are entitled to get reimbursed for your expenses.

##  Cancelled flights

Where your flight is cancelled, you are entitled to a choice of:

  * Refund the cost of your ticket within 7 days or 
  * Re-routing to your final destination at the earliest opportunity or 
  * Re-routing at a later date at your convenience, subject to the availability of seats 

You may also be entitled to compensation.

###  When compensation is not payable

You are not entitled to compensation if:

  * You have received at least 2 weeks’ notice of the cancellation; or 
  * You have received between 2 weeks and 7 days’ notice but you have been offered an alternative flight departing no more than 2 hours before your original departure time and arriving at your final destination less than 4 hours after your original scheduled time of arrival; or 
  * You have received less than 7 days’ notice but you have been offered an alternative flight departing no more than 1 hour before your original departure time and arriving at your final destination less than 2 hours after your original scheduled time of arrival. 

If the airline can prove that the cancellation was caused by an extraordinary
circumstance which could not have been avoided, even if all reasonable
measures had been taken, no compensation is payable.

Examples of _extraordinary circumstances_ may include:

  * Weather conditions 
  * Air traffic control restrictions 
  * Security risks and 
  * Industrial disputes that affect the operation of the flight 

###  Refunds and re-routing

If you choose a refund and you are entitled to compensation, the amount you
are entitled to depends on the type of flight. See  Compensation  below.

Where the choice is re-routing, the compensation that is paid depends on the
length of delay past the originally planned time in arriving at your final
destination. See  Compensation  below.

Free meals and refreshments must be offered depending on how long the waiting
time is. Hotel accommodation must also be offered free of charge where an
overnight stay becomes necessary, as well as transport between the hotel and
the airport. You must be offered 2 free telephone calls, fax messages, or
emails.

##  Delayed flights

Whether a delayed flight comes within the terms of the law depends upon the
distance of the route involved and the length of the delay. The following
flights are covered by the law:

  * Delays of 2 hours or more in the case of flights of 1500 km or less 
  * Delays of 3 hours or more in the case of all flights within the EU of more than 1500 km, and all other flights between 1500 and 3500 km 
  * Delays of 4 hours or more in the case of all other flights 

If your delayed flight is covered by the law, free meals and refreshments must
be offered depending on how long the waiting time is. Hotel accommodation must
also be offered free of charge where an overnight stay becomes necessary, as
well as transport between the hotel and the airport. You must be offered 2
free telephone calls, fax messages, or emails.

###  Refund

If the flight is delayed at least 5 hours, you must be offered a refund of
your ticket instead of flying. A refund is a full refund of the ticket for the
part or parts of the journey you have not made and for the part or parts you
already made if the flight is no longer serving any purpose to your original
travel plan. When relevant, it also includes a return flight to your first
point of departure, at the earliest opportunity.

###  Delays over 3 hours

The law does not state that compensation is payable in cases of delay.
However, on 19 November 2009, the European Court of Justice ruled in the cases
of [ Sturgeon v Condor Flugdienst GmbH and Bock and Others v Air France SA
(pdf) ](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=CELEX:62007CC0402)
that compensation similar to that paid for cancelled flights may be payable in
delay situations where the delay exceeds 3 hours. This right was upheld by the
European Court of Justice in further cases on 23 October 2012. The
compensation that is paid depends on the distance of the flight and the length
of the delay past the originally planned time in arriving at your final
destination. See  Compensation  below.

If the airline can prove that the delay was caused by an extraordinary
circumstance which could not have been avoided, even if all reasonable
measures had been taken, no compensation is payable.

##  Compensation

###  Compensation when getting a refund

Where a refund of the cost of the ticket is chosen and you are also entitled
to compensation, the following compensation must be paid:

**Compensation when getting a refund** **Type of flight** |  **Compensation**  
---|---  
Flights of 1,500 km or less  |  €250   
Flights of over 1,500 km within the EU and  
other flights between 1,500 and 3,500 km  |  €400   
All other flights  |  €600   
  
###  Compensation when re-routed

When the choice is re-routing and you are entitled to compensation, the amount
of compensation you are entitled to depends on the length of delay past your
original planned arrival time as follows:

**Compensation when re-routed** **Type of flight** |  **Delay** |  **Compensation**  
---|---|---  
Flights of 1500km or less  |  2 hours or less  |  €125   
Flights of 1500km or less  |  more than 2 hours  |  €250   
Flights of over 1,500 km within the EU and  
other flights between 1,500 and 3,500 km  |  3 hours or less  |  €200   
Flights of over 1,500 km within the EU and  
other flights between 1,500 and 3,500 km  |  more than 3 hours  |  €400   
All other flights  |  4 hours or less  |  €300   
All other flights  |  more than 4 hours  |  €600   
  
You can calculate the distance of your own particular flight at [
www.gcmap.com ](http://www.gcmap.com) .

##  Upgrading and downgrading seats

###  Upgrading

If you are offered a seat in a higher class than your original booking, the
airline cannot charge you an additional payment for this seat.

###  Downgrading

If you agree to be placed in a lower class than on your original booking, you
are entitled to reimbursement of a percentage of the difference in price. In
other words, if you booked a business or first class seat and the airline
offers you a seat in a lower class it must refund you a percentage of the
ticket price you originally paid. The percentage of the refund is calculated
as follows:

  * 30% of the ticket price for flights of 1,500 km or less or 
  * 50% of the ticket price for intra-EU flights of more than 1,500 km and all other flights between 1,500 and 3,500 km 
  * 75% of the price for all flights greater than 3,500 km 

###  Package travel

Since 2019, you have new and improved rights and flexibility when you book a
package holiday or book using linked travel arrangements. These rights and
flexibility are due to the increasing use of internet booking. Read our page
on [ package holidays and linked travel arrangements
](/en/consumer/travel/package-holidays/) .

##  How to make a complaint

###  Complain to the airline first

If you have a complaint about a cancellation, long flight delay or an instance
of denied boarding, complain to the airline first.

###  Complain to the appropriate national enforcement body

If your airline does not resolve your complaint, you should send it to the [
appropriate national enforcement body
](https://transport.ec.europa.eu/transport-themes/passenger-rights/national-
enforcement-bodies-neb_en) . Each member state is responsible for departures
from airports within its territory and arrivals into such airports from third
countries on EU/EEA-licensed carriers.

The [ Irish Aviation Authority (IAA) ](https://www.iaa.ie/consumer-
protection/air-passenger-rights) is the national enforcement body in Ireland.
It deals with complaints arising from flights departing from Irish airports or
those arriving at an Irish airport from outside the EU/EEA on an EUEEA-
licensed carrier. You can make a [ complaint online
](https://www.iaa.ie/consumer-protection/air-passenger-
rights#:~:text=How%20to%20make,our%20customer%20portal) .

If you have a complaint about a flight returning to Ireland from the EU/EEA,
you contact the national enforcement body in the EU/EEA state your flight
departed from.

For example, if you booked a return flight from Dublin to Malaga and the
outbound flight (i.e. the Dublin to Malaga flight) was cancelled then you
should contact the Irish Aviation Authority (IAA). However, if the return
flight (i.e. the Malaga to Dublin flight) was disrupted then you should
contact the Spanish equivalent, the Agencia Estatal de Seguridad Aérea (AESA).

Find more information on your rights and how to make a complaint on [ iaa.ie
](https://www.iaa.ie/consumer-protection/air-passenger-rights) . You can also
find all the [ common questions ](https://www.iaa.ie/consumer-
protection/frequently-asked-questions) about passenger rights in case of
flight cancellation, delay or other areas.
