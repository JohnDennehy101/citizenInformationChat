#  Court of Appeal

  * Introduction 
  * Structure of the Court 
  * Civil matters 
  * Criminal matters 
  * Court-martial matters 
  * Appealing Court of Appeal decisions 
  * Further information 

##  Introduction

The Court of Appeal is the second highest tier in the [ Irish courts system
](/en/justice/courts-system/courts/) . It hears appeals from the High Court in
civil cases, and appeals from the [ Circuit Criminal Court
](/en/justice/courts-system/circuit-court/) , the [ Central Criminal Court
](/en/justice/courts-system/high-court/) and the [ Special Criminal Court
](/en/justice/courts-system/special-criminal-court/) in criminal cases.

The Court of Appeal is not a court of local or limited jurisdiction. This
means that it is not restricted to hearing cases from certain geographical
areas and there is no limit to the amount of monetary damages it can award.

Established in 2014 under the [ Court of Appeal Act 2014
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2014/en/act/pub/0018/index.html) , the Court
of Appeal replaced the Court of Criminal Appeal and the Courts-Martial Appeal
Court, which were abolished. As a result, the only appeals that go to the [
Supreme Court ](/en/justice/courts-system/supreme-court/) are those which
raise issues of major public importance or where the interests of justice
require such an appeal. For more, see ‘Appealing Court of Appeal decisions’
below.

##  Structure of the Court

The Court of Appeal has up to 17 ordinary judges and the President of the
Court of Appeal. The President of the High Court and the Chief Justice are
additional judges of the Court of Appeal. The President of the Court of Appeal
assigns the work of the Court. Cases are normally heard and determined by 3
judges.

However, some interlocutory and procedural applications can be heard by the
President or another nominated judge alone. An interlocutory application is an
application for a temporary decision on an issue while the case is in progress
and awaiting a final decision. Procedural applications could include, for
example, an application for legal aid.

##  Civil matters

In civil matters the Court of Appeal can:

  * Hear appeals from decisions of the High Court 
  * Rule on a question of law submitted to it by the Circuit Court 

##  Criminal matters

The Court of Appeal hears appeals against convictions or sentences given by
the [ Circuit Criminal Court ](/en/justice/courts-system/circuit-court/) , the
[ Central Criminal Court ](/en/justice/courts-system/high-court/) and the [
Special Criminal Court ](/en/justice/courts-system/special-criminal-court/) .
If you are convicted of [ an offence on indictment ](/en/justice/criminal-
law/criminal-offences/classification-of-crimes-in-criminal-cases#l689a5) you
can appeal to the Court of Appeal about:

  * The severity of the sentence, or 
  * An alleged miscarriage of justice 

The [ Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) ](https://www.dppireland.ie/) can
appeal to the Court of Appeal about:

  * The leniency of a sentence, or 
  * A decision not to order a retrial 

The DPP can also appeal a point of law from [ a trial on indictment
](/en/justice/criminal-law/criminal-trial/criminal-trial/) to the Court of
Appeal. This does not mean that the Court may overturn the verdict of "not
guilty". It simply clarifies the law for future cases.

Although criminal cases are heard and determined by 3 judges, the Court of
Appeal gives one judgment unless there is a constitutional issue involved.
This means that if one of the judges had a different opinion about the case,
it is not made public.

##  Court-martial matters

Courts-martial are military courts. They deal with offences against military
law by members of the Defence Forces. The Court of Appeal hears appeals from
people who have been convicted by a Court-martial.

Information on the [ court-martial system is available at military.ie
](https://www.military.ie/en/public-information/courts-martial/about-military-
court-martials/about-military-court-martials.html) .

##  Appealing Court of Appeal decisions

Decisions of the Court of Appeal can only be appealed to the Supreme Court, if
the Supreme Court accepts that:

  * The decision involves a matter of general public importance, or 
  * In the interests of justice, it is necessary that there is an appeal 

In exceptional circumstances, the Supreme Court may also hear an appeal direct
from the High Court – this is known as a ‘leapfrog appeal’ because the appeal
bypasses the Court of Appeal entirely.

However, leapfrog appeals are rare and the same requirements for leave to
appeal from the Court of Appeal apply to an application for leave from the
High Court. The decision must involve a matter of general public importance
or, in the interests of justice, it must be necessary that there be an appeal
to the Supreme Court.
