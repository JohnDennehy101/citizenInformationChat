##  Introduction

You have a right to privacy at work. However, this right must be balanced with
your employer's need to run and protect their business.

Your employer wants to protect their business, reputation, resources, and
equipment. To do this, they may want to monitor how you use email, internet,
and phones, or use security cameras (CCTV) in your workplace.

When your employer collects, uses or stores information about you they must
comply with the [ General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/government-in-ireland/data-
protection/overview-of-general-data-protection-regulation/) and the [ Irish
Data Protection Act 2018 ](https://www.oireachtas.ie/en/bills/bill/2018/10/) .

This page explains the rules employers must follow when monitoring you in the
workplace. You can also read the general [ rules for data protection in the
workplace ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/employment/employment-
rights-and-conditions/data-protection-at-work/data-protection-in-the-
workplace/) .

##  Monitoring emails and internet use

###  Information your employer must give you

Your employer should give you their policy on email and internet use at work,
including the use of social media. This policy is known as an _Acceptable
Usage Policy_ (AUP). The AUP should clearly state how much you can use company
devices for personal communication.

If your employer is monitoring your email and internet use, they must tell you
their reasons for doing this.

They must tell you:

  * Who is monitoring you 
  * What they are monitoring 
  * How they are monitoring you 
  * When they are monitoring you 

They must also tell you about the procedures they will take if someone breaks
the rules for using the internet and email, and how you can respond to these
claims.

###  **The monitoring must be necessary, legitimate, and proportionate**

If your employer wants to monitor your internet use or emails, it must be:

####  **Necessary**

Your employer must be sure that monitoring is necessary. They should consider
less intrusive ways to supervise you before deciding on monitoring. For
example, blocking certain websites would be a less intrusive and generally
acceptable option compared to monitoring your internet search history.

####  **Legitimate**

The monitoring should have a legal basis. For example, it may be necessary to
stop employees from using the internet to access inappropriate content or to
share confidential company information outside the organisation.

####  **Proportionate**

Your employerâ€™s monitoring must be fair, reasonable and proportional to the
perceived threat. For example, monitoring all your emails to make sure you are
not passing on confidential information about the company would not be
proportionate. However, using an automated system to scan for viruses in your
emails would likely be seen as proportionate.

###  Telling you when there are concerns

Your employer should tell you immediately if they suspect you are misusing
electronic communications unless there are important reasons to continue
monitoring without your knowledge (see more below). Your employer can use pop-
up warnings to alert you if you are misusing company systems.

##  Using CCTV in the workplace

If your workplace has CCTV, there must be clear signs indicating where the
cameras are placed. The signs should be easy to read, well-lit and located in
visible areas. They should also give contact information for discussing the
handling of your data. For example, the owner of the premises or the security
company operating the CCTV system.

Your employer must clearly state why they are using CCTV if it is not obvious.
For example, placing a camera at the entrance to detect intruders is obvious.
However, monitoring your behaviour or performance using CCTV is not obvious.
In such cases, your employer must tell you before recording for these reasons.
Similarly, if CCTV is installed for health and safety reasons, this should be
clearly communicated to everyone in the workplace.

Your employer should have a written CCTV policy that includes:

  * The identity of the company holding the CCTV footage 
  * The reasons for using CCTV footage 
  * Any third parties the footage may be shared with 
  * How you can request to see the footage of yourself 
  * How long the footage will be held for 
  * How the footage will be secured 

###  Reasonable and unreasonable use of CCTV

Your employer must have a valid reason and consider whether using CCTV is
reasonable. For example, using CCTV to detect intruders, vandals or thieves
may be reasonable. However, using CCTV to constantly monitor employees is
intrusive and only justifiable in special circumstances.

It is very difficult for an employer to justify using CCTV to monitor areas
where you expect privacy, for example, in bathrooms. If your employer wants to
do this, they must show that several security breaches have occurred in these
areas. Even if they justify using CCTV in a bathroom, the cameras should never
capture images from cubicles or urinal areas.

##  Monitoring you without you knowing

Generally, it is against the law to collect someoneâ€™s data or monitor them
without them knowing, called _covert surveillance_ . This is only allowed in
exceptional circumstances where the data is used to detect, prevent, or
investigate crime, or to prosecute offenders.

Covert surveillance can only take place if you or your workplace are relevant
to a criminal investigation. It must be focused and for a short period. If no
evidence is found within a reasonable time, the employer should stop covert
surveillance.

A specific written policy must be put in place to allow for covert
surveillance. This policy must explain:

  * The reason and justification for covert surveillance 
  * Procedures, measures, and safeguards during ongoing surveillance 
  * The goal of involving An Garda SÃ­ochÃ¡na or other prosecution authorities to investigate alleged criminal offences 

##  Personal devices at work

Using your own device for work can raise data protection issues. Your personal
device has personal information that your employer would not normally access.

However, your employer may have legitimate concerns, like protecting personal
data processed using your work email settings or protecting business
information on your device.

If your employer allows you to use your personal device for work, they should:

  * Have a 'bring your own device' (BYOD) policy explaining how you can use your device at work and your responsibilities 
  * Know where data from your device is stored and implement security measures 
  * Make sure data is kept secure during transfers from your personal device 
  * Consider how to manage data on your device when you leave the company, or if the device is stolen or lost 

##  Monitoring your activities when working from home

When you work from home (remote working), your employer should follow the same
rules for monitoring your work. This includes telling you about:

  * Who is monitoring you 
  * What they are monitoring 
  * How they are monitoring you 
  * When they are monitoring you 

Your employer should tell you if they use employee surveillance software, such
as tracking your mouse and keyboard activity, email usage, social media,
files, and applications. This information may be included in a policy provided
by your employer.

You can also read about your [ rights and responsibilities when working from
home ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/employment/employment-rights-and-
conditions/health-and-safety/working-at-home/) .

##  Accessing your data held by your employer

You can ask your employer to give you the data they have collected about you
while monitoring your email or internet use. You can also ask to see the
images captured of you on CCTV. This is called a [ Data Subject Access Request
](https://www.dataprotection.ie/en/dpc-guidance/data-subject-access-requests-
faq) .

Your employer must respond to your request within 1 month. This can be
extended by a further 2 months if your request is complex or if you have made
numerous requests.

##  Where to make a complaint

If you have a complaint about surveillance at work, discuss this with your
employer first.

If you cannot resolve the issue with your employer, you should [ contact the
Data Protection Commission ](https://www.dataprotection.ie/en/contact/how-
contact-us) .
