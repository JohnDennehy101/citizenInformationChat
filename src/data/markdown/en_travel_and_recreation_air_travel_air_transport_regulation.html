##  Who regulates aviation in Ireland?

The Department of Transport regulates air transport. This includes commercial
and private services.

EU airlines can fly freely within the [ EU/European Economic Area (EEA)
](/en/government-in-ireland/european-government/european-union/european-
union/) . They can do this without any restrictions on flight frequency or
routes.

Airlines from countries outside of the EU/EEA must request permission. They
must do this each time they want to fly to, from, or over Ireland.

The [ Department of Defence ](https://www.defence.ie/) regulates military air
transport in Ireland.

###  **Legislation**
