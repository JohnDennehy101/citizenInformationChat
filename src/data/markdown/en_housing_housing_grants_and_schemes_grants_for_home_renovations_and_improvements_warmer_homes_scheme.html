##  Introduction

The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) provides free home energy
upgrades to homeowners who get certain social welfare payments. These upgrades
help improve the energy efficiency and warmth of your home and are also known
as the Warmer Homes Scheme.

The scheme prioritises the oldest and least energy efficient homes. You can
apply for the free upgrades again if you’ve already had work done under the
scheme, but your home would benefit from more upgrades. To access the scheme
again you must still meet the qualifying criteria.

If you do not qualify for the free upgrades, the SEAI provides other grants to
help with the cost of upgrading the energy efficiency of your home. The [
National Home Energy Upgrade Scheme ](/en/housing/housing-grants-and-
schemes/grants-for-home-renovations-and-improvements/grants-for-a-home-energy-
upgrade/) provides grants to bring your home up to an energy efficiency rating
of B2 or above, using a private company to manage the work. Or, you can get [
individual energy upgrade grants ](/en/housing/housing-grants-and-
schemes/grants-for-home-renovations-and-improvements/better-energy-homes-
scheme/) , if you only want to do certain upgrades, and would prefer to manage
the process yourself.

##  What energy upgrades are available?

The scheme covers these home energy upgrades:

  * Attic insulation 
  * Wall insulation - including cavity wall, internal wall and external wall insulation 
  * Draught-proofing 
  * Lagging jackets 
  * Energy efficient lighting 
  * Energy advice 

New central heating systems and replacement windows are also occasionally
covered by the scheme. Your windows will only be replaced if your walls are
being insulated at the same time and the existing windows are single-glazed
windows. The SEAI decides if replacement windows are needed on a case by case
basis.

##  Do I qualify for the scheme?

To qualify for this scheme you must meet these criteria:

  * You must own your home and be living in it 
  * Your home must have been built and occupied before 2006 
  * Your home must have a [ BER ](/en/housing/owning-a-home/home-owners/getting-a-building-energy-rating-for-your-home/) of C,D,E,F or G 
  * You must be getting one of the following social welfare payments: 
  * [ Fuel Allowance ](/en/social-welfare/extra-social-welfare-benefits/fuel-allowance/)
  * [ Working Family Payment ](/en/social-welfare/families-and-children/working-family-payment/)
  * [ Jobseeker’s Allowance ](/en/social-welfare/unemployed-people/jobseekers-allowance/) for over 6 months and have a child aged under 7 
  * [ Disability Allowance ](/en/social-welfare/disability-and-illness/disability-allowance/) for over 6 months and have a child aged under 7 
  * [ Domiciliary Care Allowance ](/en/social-welfare/disability-and-illness/domiciliary-care-allowance/)
  * [ One Parent Family Payment ](/en/social-welfare/families-and-children/one-parent-family-payment/)
  * [ Carer's Allowance ](/en/social-welfare/carers/carers-allowance/) and you must live with the person you care for 

**Note:** If you don’t have a BER for your home, the SEAI will do a free BER
to check that your home meets the qualifying criteria of having a BER of C or
lower.

##  How does the scheme work?

There are 4 steps to this process:

  1. Apply for the scheme [ online ](https://onlinewhs.powerappsportals.com/) or by completing an [ application form (pdf) ](https://www.seai.ie/grants/home-energy-grants/fully-funded-upgrades-for-eligible-homes/WHS-Application-Form.pdf) and sending it back to the SEAI. You must ensure you meet the qualifying criteria above when applying. You can use the [ SEAI online portal ](https://onlinewhs.powerappsportals.com/) to check if you qualify. 
  2. Have an SEAI surveyor check your home is suitable for the works and recommend upgrades. The SEAI will do this if you qualify. 
  3. Get the works done by a contractor appointed by the SEAI 
  4. Get the works assessed by the SEAI once the works are completed. This will include a new BER assessment and may involve a quality inspection. 

###  How to apply

You can [ apply online ](https://onlinewhs.powerappsportals.com/) , download
and complete the [ application form (pdf) ](https://www.seai.ie/grants/home-
energy-grants/fully-funded-upgrades-for-eligible-homes/WHS-Application-
Form.pdf) , or ask the SEAI to post the form to you. You must meet the
qualifying criteria. You can use the [ SEAI online portal
](https://onlinewhs.powerappsportals.com/) to check this.

You need to provide evidence that you qualify for the scheme. Full details of
the information needed are on the application form.

**If you are getting a qualifying payment other than Carer's Allowance, you no
longer need to get the Department of Social Protection to complete part of the
application form.** The SEAI will check your eligibility with the DSP.

If you qualify for the scheme because you are getting Carers Allowance, you
must also complete the [ Carer's Allowance Confirmation Form (pdf)
](https://www.seai.ie/grants/home-energy-grants/fully-funded-upgrades-for-
eligible-homes/Carers-Allowance-Confirmation-Form.pdf) .

You can find information about the scheme in [ the SEAI’s FAQs
](https://www.seai.ie/grants/home-energy-grants/fully-funded-upgrades-for-
eligible-homes/#comp00005968aa2f000000422e4d09) and the [ SEAI’s Scheme and
Application Guidelines (pdf) ](https://www.seai.ie/grants/home-energy-
grants/fully-funded-upgrades-for-eligible-homes/SCHEME-GUIDELINES.pdf) .

The process from application to completion of works usually takes between 24
and 26 months, though this may vary.

###  Is my home suitable?

The SEAI will review your application and if you are eligible. They will then
assess if your home is suitable for the work. A surveyor acting for the SEAI
will arrange to call to your home to do this. They will complete a survey of
your home, which involves:

  * Walking around the inside and outside of your home, including the attic 
  * Assessing the overall suitability of your home for energy efficiency upgrades 
  * Measuring, photographing and recording information about your home 
  * Discussing their findings with you, outlining what work you should get and answering any questions you have 

###  Getting the work done

If your home is suitable for the upgrades a contractor will be appointed by
the SEAI to do the work on your home.

The contractor will visit your home to assess the works needed. They will then
explain their recommendations to you, and agree a schedule for the work. You
should have a written contract with the contractor, which clearly states the
work you have agreed to.

###  After the work is done

When the work is completed, the contractor will give you documentation about
the work, including any warranties. It is important to keep these safe, as you
may need them in the future.

[ A Building Energy Rating (BER) ](/en/housing/owning-a-home/home-
owners/getting-a-building-energy-rating-for-your-home/) is carried out on all
homes after the works are complete to assess the building’s energy
performance. A [ BER certificate ](http://www.seai.ie/energy-ratings/building-
energy-rating-ber/) and advisory report will be sent to you and will also be
published on the [ SEAI’s national BER register
](https://ndber.seai.ie/pass/ber/search.aspx) .

Some homes will also be inspected to ensure that the works meet the required
standards.

##  How much will it cost?

You will not be charged for work done under this scheme. However, if you sell
your home within 5 years of getting the work done, you need to tell the SEAI.
You should inform them in writing at least 30 days before your property is
sold. The SEAI may ask you to repay some or all of the grant. This is at their
discretion.
