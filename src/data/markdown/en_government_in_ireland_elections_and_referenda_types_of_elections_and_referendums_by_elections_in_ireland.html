#  Bye-elections

  * Introduction 
  * Dáil bye-elections 
  * Seanad bye-elections 
  * Bye-election posters 

##  Introduction

A bye-election is an election to fill a seat that has been vacated in between
general or Seanad elections.

If an elected member of the Dáil or the Seanad dies, resigns or retires, their
seat is filled in a bye-election unless it is only a short time until the next
general election.

Candidates from political parties and independents can contest a bye-election.
Usually, only one person is elected, unless more than one seat in the
constituency has been vacated.

The European Parliament does not operate a bye-election system. Candidates
submit a replacement list before the election, which is used to fill their
seat if it is vacated. Normally, the candidates on the replacement list come
from the same political party or background. If no replacement candidates list
was presented in respect of the MEP who won the seat at the election or it is
not possible to fill the vacancy from the relevant list, the Dáil may select a
person to fill the vacancy from any replacement candidates list presented for
that constituency at the election.

Where a local councillor resigns, retires or dies, their party nominates a
replacement candidate. If an independent councillor dies, the local authority
follows its own procedures as set out in its standing orders.

##  Dáil bye-elections

When a TD (a [ member of the Dáil ](/en/government-in-ireland/houses-of-the-
oireachtas/dail-eireann/) ) dies or resigns, the Dáil (one of the houses of
Parliament in Ireland) passes a resolution directing the returning officer of
the TD's constituency to hold an election to fill the vacancy. The Dáil issues
a writ to the returning officer. A writ is a type of legal order.

The Dáil must issue the writ within 6 months of the death or retirement of the
TD. If it does not, then the Ceann Comhairle must direct the Clerk of the Dáil
to issue the writ. The law governing the issuing of writs in bye-elections is
the [ Electoral (Amendment) Act 2011
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2011/en/act/pub/0014/index.html) .

The procedure for nominating candidates, voting and the conduct of the count
in Dáil bye-elections is the same as for a [ general election
](/en/government-in-ireland/elections-and-referenda/voting/voting-procedure-
in-a-general-election/) .

A person who is currently a member of Dáil Eireann cannot be a candidate in a
Dáil bye-election.

##  Seanad bye-elections

If a senator dies or resigns, [ the Seanad ](/en/government-in-ireland/houses-
of-the-oireachtas/the-seanad/) passes a motion directing the Clerk of Seanad
Eireann to notify the Minister for Local Government that a seat has been
vacated.

The Minister must make an order directing that a bye-election be held to fill
the vacated seat. This must be done within 180 days. Nomination of candidates
and voting is the same as in a Seanad election. The bye-election is held only
in respect of the [ relevant panel
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/government_in_ireland/national_government/houses_of_the_oireachtas/the_seanad.html#l9d8b9)
.

##  Bye-election posters

You must have advance permission of the owner of the pole or structure to hang
posters and signs in public places.

Under the [ Litter Pollution Act 1997
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1997/en/act/pub/0012/index.html) , as amended
by [ Section 9 of the Electoral (Amendment) (No. 2) Act 2009
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2009/en/act/pub/0009/sec0009.html) , election
posters and signs cannot be erected until an order has been made appointing
the polling date for the bye-election or for 30 days prior to the date of the
poll (whichever is the shorter period). [ Local authorities ](/en/government-
in-ireland/how-government-works/local-and-regional-government/functions-of-
local-authorities/) have the power to remove these items should they
disintegrate or cause a litter nuisance.

Following a bye-election, a party or candidate  must remove posters  within a
7-day period  . After that date, an on-the-spot fine of €150 is issued by your
local authority in respect of each remaining poster. Your local authority will
remove the poster as the fine is issued.

If a party or candidate has been issued with a fine and refuses to pay, they
can be prosecuted in the [ District Court ](/en/justice/courts-
system/district-court/) by your local authority to enforce payment. The
maximum penalty in the District Court following conviction for non-payment of
the fine is €4,000.

A person convicted of a litter offence may also be required by the court to
pay the local authority’s costs and expenses in investigating the offence and
bringing the prosecution, as well as the costs of clearing up the litter.
