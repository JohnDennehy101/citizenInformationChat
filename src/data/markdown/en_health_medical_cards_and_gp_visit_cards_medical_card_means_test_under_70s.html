##  Introduction

If you are aged under 70 when you apply for a [ medical card
](/en/health/medical-cards-and-gp-visit-cards/medical-card/) or [ GP visit
card ](/en/health/medical-cards-and-gp-visit-cards/gp-visit-cards/) , the HSE
will review your situation and your weekly income to check if you qualify.
This may include a review of your financial situation, called a means test.

Your income, savings, investments and property are assessed in the means test,
but there are certain exceptions. If you have a spouse or partner, the HSE
looks at your combined finances.

Check if you automatically qualify for a medical card, as some [ people are
exempt from the means test
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/health/medical-cards-and-gp-visit-
cards/medical-card/#552e17) . If you are not in one of these groups, your
income is reviewed by the HSE and must be below a certain amount to qualify.

This page explains the means test for people aged under 70 – how it is carried
out, what income is included and what income is excluded.

###  **Medical cards if you are over 70**

People [ aged over 70 have a different means test ](/en/health/medical-cards-
and-gp-visit-cards/medical-card-means-test-over-70s/) assessment for the
medical card.

If you do not qualify under the means test for people over 70 you can be
assessed under the general means test rules explained here.

###  **GP visit cards**

If you are under 70, the way the HSE assesses your financial means is the same
for the [ medical card ](/en/health/medical-cards-and-gp-visit-cards/medical-
card/) and for the [ GP visit card ](/en/health/medical-cards-and-gp-visit-
cards/gp-visit-cards/) – but the income limits are different.

If your income is above the limit for a medical card, you are automatically
assessed by the HSE for the [ GP visit card
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/health/medical-cards-and-gp-visit-
cards/gp-visit-cards/) which has higher income limits.

You automatically get a [ GP visit card ](/en/health/medical-cards-and-gp-
visit-cards/gp-visit-cards/) without a means test if you are either:

  * [ Aged under 8 ](/en/health/medical-cards-and-gp-visit-cards/gp-visit-cards-for-under-8s/) or [ over 70 ](/en/health/medical-cards-and-gp-visit-cards/medical-card-means-test-over-70s/)
  * Get [ Carer’s Benefit ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/social-welfare-payments/carers/carers-benefit/) or [ Carer’s Allowance ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/social-welfare-payments/carers/carers-allowance/) at full or half-rate 

###  **When does the HSE review my finances?**

When you apply online, the HSE does a quick review of your finances to check
if you might qualify for a [ medical card ](/en/health/medical-cards-and-gp-
visit-cards/medical-card/) or [ GP visit card ](/en/health/medical-cards-and-
gp-visit-cards/gp-visit-cards/) . It does a full review of your finances later
in the application process when you send them [ documents to prove your
financial situation ](https://www2.hse.ie/services/schemes-allowances/medical-
cards/applying/documents-you-need/) , for example, payslips.

###

##  How does the means test work?

The HSE has _basic rates_ that vary depending on your age, living situation,
marital status and if you have children. If your income is below the HSE basic
rate, you will qualify.

The basic rate income limits for the [ medical card ](/en/health/medical-
cards-and-gp-visit-cards/medical-card/) are lower than the limits for the [ GP
visit card ](/en/health/medical-cards-and-gp-visit-cards/gp-visit-cards/) .

Your weekly income is your net income. This is your income after tax, PRSI and
Universal Social Charge (USC) have been deducted.

If your income is above the HSE’s basic rate, you may still qualify for a [
medical card ](/en/health/medical-cards-and-gp-visit-cards/medical-card/) or [
GP visit card ](/en/health/medical-cards-and-gp-visit-cards/gp-visit-cards/)
after you add extra allowances for children and allowable expenses (see
below).

**Discretionary medical card**

If your finances are still above the qualifying limits for both a [ medical
card ](/en/health/medical-cards-and-gp-visit-cards/medical-card/) and [ GP
visit card ](/en/health/medical-cards-and-gp-visit-cards/gp-visit-cards/) the
HSE can look at your social and medical situation. They will decide if you
would have trouble paying for medical care for you and your family and may
provide a medical card. You can read more about [ discretionary medical cards.
](https://www2.hse.ie/services/schemes-allowances/medical-cards/other-types-
of-medical-card/discretionary-medical-cards/)

  * Wages or earnings (net pay, after you pay tax, PRSI and USC) 
  * Pensions 
  * Maintenance payments 
  * Rental income from property other than the family home, with costs deducted 
  * Property (other than the family home) 
  * Interest from capital and savings 
  * Income from royalties or payments under a settlement, covenant or from an estate 

If your **only income is from social welfare** or HSE payments, you will get a
[ medical card ](/en/health/medical-cards-and-gp-visit-cards/medical-card/)
even if your income is over the income limits for your age and situation.

Check the [ documents you may need. ](https://www2.hse.ie/services/schemes-
allowances/medical-cards/applying/documents-you-need/)

##  Income not assessed

**Some payments from the State are not included:**

  * **HSE payments** : Mobility Allowance, Blind Welfare Allowance 
  * **Social welfare payments** : Working Family Payment, Child Benefit, Carer's Allowance, Domiciliary Care Allowance, Guardian's Payments; weekly supplements (such as a diet or heating supplement) paid under the Supplementary Welfare Allowance scheme; Fuel, Island, Living Alone and Over 80 Allowances 
  * **Other payments** : Third-level educational maintenance grants, Rehabilitation Maintenance Allowance, Foster Care Allowance. 

####  **Earnings while on Disability Allowance**

If you are getting [ Disability Allowance ](/en/social-welfare/disability-and-
illness/disability-allowance/) and working, income you earn up to €427 per
week is not taken into account in the means test for the medical card. This
does not affect the [ means test for Disability Allowance ](/en/social-
welfare/disability-and-illness/disability-allowance/) .

When reviewing your income for a [ medical card ](/en/health/medical-cards-
and-gp-visit-cards/medical-card/) or [ GP visit card ](/en/health/medical-
cards-and-gp-visit-cards/gp-visit-cards/) , the HSE does not include:

  * Compensation payments made by the Residential Institutions Redress Board 
  * Repayments made under the Health (Repayment) Scheme (that is, the Nursing Home repayment scheme) 
  * Awards made to people who contracted Hepatitis C or HIV from contaminated blood products (together with income from the investment of that money) 
  * Ex-gratia payments approved by the Lourdes Hospital Redress Board under the terms of the Lourdes Hospital Redress Scheme 2007 
  * Compensation awards payable under the Redress for Women in Certain Institutions Act 2015. 

###  **Rent-a-room scheme exclusion**

If you rent a room in your home under the [ rent-a-room scheme
](/en/housing/owning-a-home/home-owners/renting-a-room-in-your-home/) , you
can have up to €14,000 of the annual rent disregarded in the means test for a
medical card or GP visit card.

##  Savings and investments assessment

Any savings and investments you have are also reviewed by the HSE in the means
test for a [ medical card ](/en/health/medical-cards-and-gp-visit-
cards/medical-card/) or [ GP visit card ](/en/health/medical-cards-and-gp-
visit-cards/gp-visit-cards/) .

Savings, investments or property up to €36,000 for a single person, or €72,000
for a couple, are disregarded.

Interest on savings or investments over the limit is taken into account in the
means test.

This means only the interest or income earned on your savings and investments
will be counted as income, not the total value of the savings or investments
themselves.

###  **How does the HSE assess interest?**

There are different ways the HSE can assess your savings and investments. They
can use:

  * A Certificate of Interest (usually from your bank) of all your savings, or 
  * Copies of bank statements showing the current balance on your account or account 

If you have stocks or shares, you will need to provide a copy of your current
Share Certificates showing shareholdings.

The HSE can also calculate your weekly income from savings and investments
using the following rules:

**Capital** |  **Weekly means assessed**  
---|---  
First €36,000 (single), €72,000 (couple)  |  Nil   
Next €10,000  |  €1 per €1,000   
Next €10,000  |  €2 per €1,000   
More than €56,000 (single) or €92,000 (couple)  |  €4 per €1,000   
  
For example, if you are a couple and have €90,000 in savings, any income on
the first €72,000 will not be considered. The income on the next €10,000 will
be considered at €1 per €1,000 totalling €10. The balance of €8,000 will be
considered at €2 per €1,000 totalling €16.

Check what [ documents you may need for the HSE to assess your income from
savings and investments ](https://www2.hse.ie/services/schemes-
allowances/medical-cards/applying/documents-you-need/) [ .
](https://www2.hse.ie/services/schemes-allowances/medical-
cards/applying/documents-you-need/)

##  Is property assessed?

The **value** of your family home is not included in the medical card and GP
visit card means test.

The value of weekly income from other property is reviewed by the HSE.

Check what [ documents you may need for your property to be assessed by the
HSE. ](https://www2.hse.ie/services/schemes-allowances/medical-
cards/applying/documents-you-need/)

###  **Property that is rented**

If you have property that you rent out, the rental income is assessed by the
HSE. Rental income can include income from renting a room in your family home,
a holiday home, leased land or any other property.

Rental income is assessed after deducting mortgage payments and insurance
premiums.

**Accommodation Recognition Payment**

The [ Accommodation Recognition Payment for hosting international protection
applicants from Ukraine ](/en/moving-country/ukrainian-refugees-in-
ireland/accommodation-recognition-payment/) is not assessed as rental income
for a medical card.

####  **Rent-a-room scheme exclusion**

If you rent a room in your home under the [ rent-a-room scheme
](/en/housing/owning-a-home/home-owners/renting-a-room-in-your-home/) , you
can have up to €14,000 of the annual rent disregarded in the means test for a
medical card or GP visit card.

###  **Property that is not rented**

**If you are aged under 70** and have unused land or buildings that you are
not renting, but could be leased or sold, the HSE reviews the value of the
property as a savings and investment assessment (above).

**If you are** [ **aged over 70** ](/en/health/medical-cards-and-gp-visit-
cards/medical-card-means-test-over-70s/) **,** income will not be assessed
from any property that is not generating a rental income.

##  How is self-employment income assessed?

If you are self-employed and applying for a [ medical card
](/en/health/medical-cards-and-gp-visit-cards/medical-card/) or [ GP visit
card ](/en/health/medical-cards-and-gp-visit-cards/gp-visit-cards/) , you will
need to provide evidence of all your work, both self-employed and for other
employers.

The HSE will review your most recent Income Tax Return Form 11 and all pages
of your Notice of Assessment (NOA) from Revenue.

If you are self-employed and your business has been **running for less than
one year,** you need to provide a set of accounts signed off by your
accountant.

If you are self-employed and your business has **recently stopped trading,**
you need to provide a self-declaration letter indicating the date you were
last self-employed.

Read more about [ what documents you need for your application as somebody
self-employed ](https://www2.hse.ie/services/schemes-allowances/medical-
cards/applying/documents-you-need/#self-employment) .

You can also get detailed information from the [ HSE Medical card and GP Visit
Card National Assessment Guidelines (pdf)
](https://www.hse.ie/eng/staff/pcrs/medical-card-and-gp-visit-card-assessment-
guidelines.pdf) .

##  Allowable expenses

Some living expenses are allowable. This means the HSE will add the cost of
certain weekly expenses to your basic rate.

This increases your weekly qualifying financial threshold.

Your qualifying financial threshold is the limit of how much income you can
have each week and still qualify for a [ medical card ](/en/health/medical-
cards-and-gp-visit-cards/medical-card/) or [ GP visit card
](/en/health/medical-cards-and-gp-visit-cards/gp-visit-cards/) .

Allowable expenses include:

**Housing**

  * Rent (not including any amounts paid by [ Housing Assistance Payment ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/housing/renting-a-home/help-with-renting/housing-assistance-payment/) or [ Rent Supplement ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/social-welfare-payments/supplementary-welfare-schemes/rent-supplement/) ) 
  * Reasonable mortgage payments on your family home and other land or property 
  * Mortgage protection insurance and associated life assurance 
  * Home insurance 

**Childcare and other caring costs**

  * Childcare costs 
  * Maintenance payments you make 
  * Nursing home, private nursing or home-care costs for you or your spouse 

**Travel costs**

  * Costs of travelling to work including: 
    * The cost of public transport 
    * Driving expenses if a car is required, at a rate of 30 cent per mile/18 cent per km. If a couple needs two cars to travel to work, a double allowance applies. 
    * Reasonable contributions towards carpooling costs.
