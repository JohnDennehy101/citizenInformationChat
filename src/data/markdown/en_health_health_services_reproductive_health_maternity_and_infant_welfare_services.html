##  Introduction

If you are pregnant and you are [ ordinarily resident ](/en/health/health-
system/entitlement-to-public-health-services#l2b820) in Ireland you are
entitled to free maternity care under the Maternity and Infant Care Scheme.

After you have your baby, your baby can also get some health checks,
vaccinations and developmental checks free of charge.

This page explains the Maternity and Infant Care Scheme, the services provided
to you by the public health nurse after your baby is born, and what to do if
you think you may have postnatal depression.

##  Maternity and Infant Care Scheme

The Maternity and Infant Care Scheme provides a programme of care to all
expectant mothers who are [ ordinarily resident ](/en/health/health-
system/entitlement-to-public-health-services#l2b820) in Ireland.

This care is provided by your GP and a maternity unit/hospital. This is called
_combined care_ or _shared care_ .

You are entitled to this service even if you do not have a medical card or GP
visit card. Almost all GPs have agreements with the [ Health Service Executive
(HSE) ](http://hse.ie/) to provide these services; they do not have to be part
of the [ medical card ](/en/health/medical-cards-and-gp-visit-cards/medical-
card/) scheme.

Applications for services under the Scheme are made though your GP when your
pregnancy is confirmed. The diagnosis of pregnancy forms part of the Scheme.
The application form should be completed by both you and your GP and your GP
will submit it to the HSE where it will be processed.

###  What is included in the scheme?

On the Maternity and Infant Care Scheme, your maternity care is provided by
your family doctor (GP) and a hospital _obstetrician_ (a doctor who
specialises in pregnancy and labour).

If this is your first pregnancy, the GP will carry out your first examination
(ideally before 12 weeks). You will have a further 5 examinations during the
pregnancy, which alternate between GP visits and maternity unit/hospital
visits. Your schedule of visits may be changed by your GP or hospital
obstetrician, depending on your situation.

If this is not your first pregnancy, you will have an initial examination and
a further 6 examinations.

If you have a significant illness, for example, diabetes or hypertension, you
may have up to 5 additional visits with your GP.

The Maternity and Infant Care Scheme also provides for 2 postnatal visits to
the GP. This includes:

  * An examination of the baby at 2 weeks old 
  * An examination of you and the baby at 6 weeks old 

###  Hospital charges

As part of the Maternity and Infant Care Scheme, you are entitled to free in-
patient, out-patient and emergency care in public hospitals in relation to the
pregnancy and birth. You do not have to pay [ hospital charges
](/en/health/health-services/gp-and-hospital-services/hospital-charges/) .

However, if you need hospital care for other illnesses which are not related
to your pregnancy, this is not covered by the Scheme.

If you choose to be a private patient of your consultant, you will be liable
for the full range of in-patient charges. Read about the [ differences between
public, semi-private and private maternity services ](/en/birth-family-
relationships/before-your-baby-is-born/choices-in-antenatal-care/) .

##  Medical card or GP visit card for your baby

After your baby is born, their entitlement to other free GP services depends
on whether or not they have a [ medical card ](/en/health/medical-cards-and-
gp-visit-cards/medical-card/) or [ GP visit card ](/en/health/medical-cards-
and-gp-visit-cards/gp-visit-cards/) . Children under the age of 6 are
automatically entitled to a GP visit card – read about [ registering for your
child’s GP visit card ](/en/health/medical-cards-and-gp-visit-cards/gp-visit-
cards-for-under-8s/) .

If you have a medical card, you can apply for one for your baby if you are
getting [ Child Benefit ](/en/social-welfare/families-and-children/child-
benefit/) for them. Send a covering note along with a photocopy of the child's
birth certificate, their PPS Number and your medical card details to the
medical card [ Client Registration Unit ](/en/health/medical-cards-and-gp-
visit-cards/medical-card#lef21f) .

##  The public health nurse

Public health nurses are registered nurses that provide nursing and midwifery
care in the community.

If you have had your baby in hospital, the public health nurse will visit you
and your baby at home, free of charge. This visit usually happens within 72
hours of returning home from hospital.

If you have had a [ home birth ](/en/birth-family-relationships/before-your-
baby-is-born/home-birth/) or used the [ Domino Scheme ](/en/birth-family-
relationships/before-your-baby-is-born/flexible-maternity-services#lc93a6) ,
your midwife will have already visited you. They will then hand over your care
to your public health nurse.

Read more about [ maternity care provided by the public health nurse
](/en/birth-family-relationships/after-your-baby-is-born/maternity-care-and-
public-health-nurse/) .

##  Your child’s health and development checks

###  The ‘heel prick’ test

Your midwife or public health nurse will offer to do a ‘newborn bloodspot
screening’ for your baby. This is also known as the _heel prick test_ . It
checks if your baby is at risk of a number of rare conditions, including
cystic fibrosis. You will be asked for your consent.

The heel prick test usually takes place in your home. However, if you stay in
hospital longer than 72 hours after the birth of your baby, it may take place
in the hospital.

Read more about [ heel prick screening ](https://www2.hse.ie/screening-and-
vaccinations/heel-prick-screening/heel-prick-screening-what-it-is.html) on the
HSE website.

###  Developmental checks

The public health nurse will check your baby's development at different
stages. For example, at 9 months, they will check your baby's eyesight and
hearing, motor development, vocalisation and general growth.

Developmental checks are generally carried out at:

  * 3 months 
  * 9-11 months 
  * 18-24 months 
  * 3-and-a-quarter years to 3-and-a-half years 

You will be contacted by your public health nurse before each check to arrange
a date and time. If you have not heard from the public health nurse, [ call
your local health centre
](https://www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/2/healthcentres/) to make an
appointment. If you are concerned about your baby's development between
checks, contact your public health nurse for advice.

Examinations of your baby's development by your public health nurse are
provided free of charge.

Read more about [ your child’s developmental checks
](https://www2.hse.ie/wellbeing/child-health/your-childs-developmental-
checks/overview.html) on the HSE website.

###  Children’s immunisation and vaccinations

Immunisation is a safe and effective way to help the body prevent or fight off
certain diseases. Immunisation is provided through vaccinations.

Under the [ Primary Childhood Immunisation Schedule
](https://www.hse.ie/eng/health/immunisation/pubinfo/pcischedule/immschedule/)
, all recommended childhood vaccines are provided to children free of charge.

Read about the [ vaccinations provided to children ](/en/health/health-
services/children-s-health/vaccinations-for-children/) , and the ages at which
they can get each one.

##  Supports for postnatal depression

Postnatal depression affects 10 to 15% of women within the first year of
giving birth.

[ Symptoms of postnatal depression ](https://www2.hse.ie/conditions/mental-
health/postnatal-depression/postnatal-depression.html) may start as baby blues
and then get worse. For some women, symptoms become most obvious when your
baby is 4 to 6 months old.

If you think you are experiencing postnatal depression, the most important
thing to do is ask for help. Contact your public health nurse or GP to talk
about how you are feeling. Read aboutostnatal depression and [ supports for
postnatal depression ](https://www2.hse.ie/conditions/mental-health/postnatal-
depression/getting-help.html) .
