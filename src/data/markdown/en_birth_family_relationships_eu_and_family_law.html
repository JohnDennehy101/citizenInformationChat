##  Introduction

The European Union (EU) has a limited role in family law matters. Each
individual member state has its own rules about separation, divorce,
maintenance of spouses and children, custody and guardianship and other family
law matters.

The role of the EU is ensuring that decisions made in one country can be
implemented in another. It also has a role in trying to establish which
country has jurisdiction to hear a particular case. In effect, the EU does not
have rules which govern, for example, who is entitled to have custody or
access but it does have rules which try to make sure that custody and access
orders made in one country can be put into effect in another.

###  The problem of conflict of laws

If all the parties to a family law dispute are from one country and are living
in that country then generally the dispute is heard by the courts of that
country, and a decision is made and implemented in accordance with the laws of
that country. Problems arise when the parties are not living in the same
country or are not nationals of the same country. It may not be clear which
country’s courts should make the decisions, which country’s laws should be
applied and how the decisions made in one country can be implemented in
another.

Each country has its own rules about how these conflicts of laws should be
dealt with. It is possible that several countries would have jurisdiction to
hear the dispute and that each would apply different laws. The procedures for
having judgments recognised and enforced in another country can be difficult
and sometimes impossible. Generally, if you have a judgment from a court in
one country, you have to go through another judicial process in another
country in order to have it implemented there.

These problems arise between all countries and not only between EU member
states. A number of international conventions have been agreed dealing with
such conflicts of laws. These international conventions continue to apply
between EU member states and non-EU member states. The EU regulations in
family law matters apply in all the EU member states except Denmark which has
opted out. So if there is a conflict of laws involving Denmark and another EU
member state, the matter is governed by the international conventions if they
are relevant.

Within the EU, there has been a simplified process for implementing certain
judgments and orders from one EU member state in another. An even more
streamlined process within the EU now applies to many orders relating to
matrimonial matters and parental responsibility which were made in proceedings
which started on or after 1 August 2022.

###  EU competence to deal with family law

The EU is only able to make laws in areas where EU treaties give it the
specific power to do so. It cannot make laws in relation to divorce,
maintenance or parental responsibility. This means the EU cannot make laws
setting out the terms under which a divorce may be granted, or the
responsibility of spouses to pay maintenance, or how decisions on custody and
access to children are to be made.

However, the EU does have responsibility to promote judicial (legal) co-
operation in civil matters which have cross border implications. It has made a
number of regulations dealing with judicial co-operation. In general, these
regulations are based on the principle of mutual recognition – that is, that
decisions lawfully made in one EU country should be recognised and enforced in
other EU countries and the procedures for doing so should be as simple as
possible.

##  EU Regulations

EU rules relating to matrimonial matters, parental responsibility and
maintenance apply only in cross-border cases.

###  Matrimonial matters (divorce, separation and annulment) and parental
responsibility

On 1 August 2022, [ Regulation 2019/1111 ](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-
content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv%3AOJ.L_.2019.178.01.0001.01.ENG&toc=OJ%3AL%3A2019%3A178%3ATOC)
came into effect. It sets out the rules governing the jurisdiction,
recognition and enforcement of matrimonial and parental responsibility orders
in the EU in respect of legal proceedings that start after 1 August 2022 and
agreements made after that date.

[ Regulation 2201/2003 ](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-
content/EN/TXT/?uri=LEGISSUM:l33194) also sets out the rules governing the
jurisdiction, recognition and enforcement of matrimonial and parental
responsibility orders in the EU. However, it applies to legal proceedings that
began before 1 August 2022 and agreements made before that date.

The scope of the Regulations is confined to matrimonial matters (divorce,
legal separation, annulment) while parental responsibility includes rights of
custody and rights of access, guardianship, the placement of a child in a
foster family or in institutional care.

###  Maintenance

[ Regulation 4/2009 ](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-
content/EN/ALL/?uri=CELEX%3A32009R0004) sets out the current rules governing
the recognition and enforcement of maintenance orders in EU member states. It
aims to provide for the recovery of maintenance within the EU.

##  Divorce, separation and annulment

[ Regulation 2201/2003 ](http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-
content/EN/TXT/?qid=1422886426094&uri=URISERV:l33194) sets out the rules on
jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in matrimonial
matters in cases that started between 1 March 2005 and 31 July 2022.

[ Regulation 2019/1111 ](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-
content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv%3AOJ.L_.2019.178.01.0001.01.ENG&toc=OJ%3AL%3A2019%3A178%3ATOC)
sets out the rules on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of
judgments in matrimonial matters in cases that begin on or after 1 August
2022.

Matrimonial matters include divorce, annulment and legal separation but does
not include, for example, the property consequences of marriage and the
grounds for divorce.

###  Jurisdiction

Regulations 2019/1111 and 2201/2013 provide that you may take a matrimonial
action in the courts of the EU member state where:

  * one or both of you are or were habitually resident, or 
  * the member state of your common nationality, or 
  * your common [ domicile ](/en/money-and-tax/tax/moving-country-and-taxation/tax-residence-and-domicile-in-ireland/) . 

This means, of course, that it may be possible to take the action in a number
of states. The Regulation provides that once proceedings have started in a
particular member state, other states must refuse jurisdiction.

The Regulation does not deal with the question of which law applies. This is a
matter for the member state that has jurisdiction. For example, most countries
other than Ireland apply the law of the country of [ habitual residence
](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/social-assistance-
payments/habitual-residence-condition/) of the parties while Ireland applies
the law of the country of [ domicile ](/en/money-and-tax/tax/moving-country-
and-taxation/tax-residence-and-domicile-in-ireland/) .

###  Recognition of decisions

The Regulation provides that a decision on a matrimonial matter made in one
member state must be recognised and enforced in the other states without any
special procedures. You do not have to go to court to have it recognised.
However, any interested party may ask the court in the other member state not
to recognise the decision. The court may refuse to recognise the decision:

  * If such recognition is clearly contrary to public policy 
  * If the decision contradicts another decision 
  * If there were certain procedural defects with the decision – in particular if one party was not properly served with the relevant papers and did not put in an appearance as a result 

The court is not entitled to hear an appeal against the foreign decision.

###  The law applicable to international divorces

[ Regulation 2201/2003 ](http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-
content/EN/TXT/?qid=1422886426094&uri=URISERV:l33194) or [ 2019/1111
](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-
content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv%3AOJ.L_.2019.178.01.0001.01.ENG&toc=OJ%3AL%3A2019%3A178%3ATOC)
do not determine what law applies when an application for divorce is being
considered. For example, if an Irish person living in Spain wants to divorce a
German spouse who is living in France, which national law applies?

[ Regulation 1259/2010 ](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-
content/en/ALL/?uri=CELEX%3A32010R1259) (known as "the Rome III Regulation")
implementing enhanced cooperation in the area of the law applicable to divorce
and legal separation currently applies in 17 member states. Ireland has not
opted into this Regulation. The Regulation allows international couples in the
member states where it applies to agree in advance which law will apply to
their divorce or legal separation, as long as the agreed law is the law of the
member state with which they have a closer connection. In case the couple
cannot agree, the judge can use a common formula for deciding which country's
law applies.

##  Parental responsibility

[ Regulation 2201/2003 ](http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-
content/EN/TXT/?qid=1422886426094&uri=URISERV:l33194) (also known as "the
Brussels II bis Regulation”) also sets out the rules on jurisdiction and the
recognition and enforcement of judgments in matters of parental responsibility
for children in cases arising between 1 March 2005 and 31 July 2022.

[ Regulation 2019/1111 ](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-
content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv%3AOJ.L_.2019.178.01.0001.01.ENG&toc=OJ%3AL%3A2019%3A178%3ATOC)
sets out the rules on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of
judgments in matters of parental responsibility for children in cases arising
on or after 1 August 2022.

They apply in a very wide variety of situations. For example:

  * The parents do not need to be married to each other. 
  * The holders of parental responsibility need not be the biological parents of the child in question. 
  * It is not confined to court judgments as it applies to agreements between parents if such agreements are enforceable in the country where they were made. 

###  What Regulation 2201/2003 and 2019/111 cover

[ Regulation 2201/2003 ](http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-
content/EN/TXT/?qid=1422886426094&uri=URISERV:l33194) and [ 2019/111
](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-
content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv%3AOJ.L_.2019.178.01.0001.01.ENG&toc=OJ%3AL%3A2019%3A178%3ATOC)
cover the following aspects of parental responsibility:

  * Jurisdiction – what country should hear the case 
  * Recognition and enforcement – how decisions made in one country are to be recognised and enforced in another 
  * Co-operation between central authorities 
  * Specific rules on international child abduction and access rights 

Parental responsibility includes rights of custody and rights of access,
guardianship, the placement of a child in a foster family or in institutional
care. The Regulation does not apply to proceedings which involve:

  * Establishing and challenging maternity and paternity 
  * Judgments in relation to adoption 
  * The child's first and last names 
  * Age of majority 
  * Trusts and inheritance 
  * Measures taken following criminal offences committed by children 

The Regulation also applies to certain measures concerning the child’s
property if they are related to the protection of the child.

###  Jurisdiction

The general rule is that the court which has jurisdiction in matters of
parental responsibility is the court of the country where the child is
habitually resident. Again, in general, once the matter is before the courts
in one country, that country continues to have jurisdiction even if the child
has recently lawfully changed country of residence. It is possible to have the
case transferred to the new country of residence if certain conditions are met
and if it would be in the best interests of the child.

The parents may agree to have the question of parental responsibility decided
in the court which has jurisdiction on the matrimonial matter (for example,
divorce, annulment or legal separation) or may agree to have the case heard by
the court of a country with which the child has a close connection (for
example, nationality).

If the child's habitual residence cannot be established, then the EU country
in which the child is present has jurisdiction.

In certain circumstances, the court which has jurisdiction may refer the case
to another court if that other court is better placed to hear the case and
this is in the best interests of the child. This could arise, for example, if
the child’s habitual residence has changed. There are time limits on this
procedure. If a child’s habitual residence changes as a result of a wrongful
removal or retention, jurisdiction may move only under very strict conditions.

The Regulation also includes rules on what is to happen if the proceedings are
started in more than one member state.

In urgent cases, a court may take provisional protective measures even if
another member state has jurisdiction on the substantive issue.

###  Recognition and enforcement

Judgments given in one member state must be recognised and enforced in another
member state. The court in the other member state may refuse to recognise the
order only on the grounds that:

  * It would be manifestly contrary to that member state’s public policy 
  * The child was not given an opportunity to be heard (except in urgent cases) 
  * The judgment was given in the absence of a person who was not served with the documents instituting the proceedings in sufficient time and in such a way as to enable them to arrange for their defence 
  * A person claiming that the judgment infringes their parental responsibility was not given the opportunity to be heard 

If you are applying to a court in another member state for recognition and
enforcement, you are entitled to legal aid there if you were entitled in your
own state. You may also get help from the Central Authority in the country
where you are seeking recognition and enforcement.

###  Co-operation between national authorities

The Regulations create a system of co-operation between Central Authorities of
the member states. These authorities are obliged to facilitate communications
between the courts of the relevant countries and must facilitate agreements
between parents through mediation or other means.

###  Child abduction

Child abduction is the unlawful removal or retention of a child. If you have
custody of a child and your child is abducted to another member state, you may
apply to that state for the return of the child. The courts of the member
state to which the child has been abducted can only refuse return of the child
in limited circumstances – for example, if there are not adequate safeguards
to ensure that there is no serious risk that return would expose the child to
harm.

In general, the court must order the immediate return of the child. You can
find out more in our page on [ international child abduction ](/en/birth-
family-relationships/services-and-supports-for-children/international-child-
abduction/) .

###  Hague Conventions

The [ Hague Convention
](http://www.hcch.net/index_en.php?act=conventions.text&cid=24) of 25 October
1980 on the civil aspects of international child abduction (“the 1980 Hague
Convention”) and the [ Hague Convention (1996)
](http://www.hcch.net/index_en.php?act=conventions.text&cid=70) on
jurisdiction, applicable law, recognition, enforcement and cooperation in
respect of parental responsibility and measures for the protection of children
continue to apply in cases where the 2003 or 2019 Regulations do not.

The European Convention on Recognition and Enforcement of Decisions Concerning
Custody of Children and on Restoration of Custody of Children [ (the
Luxembourg Convention)
](http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/EN/Treaties/Html/105.htm) applies to a
number of European countries. It is now of limited relevance because the EU
Regulation or the Hague Convention covers the relevant countries.

Both Conventions were signed in 1980. They were brought into effect in Ireland
in 1991 by the [ Child Abduction and Enforcement of Court Orders Act 1991
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1991/en/act/pub/0006/index.html) .  

##  Maintenance

The recognition and enforcement of maintenance orders in EU member states is
governed by [ Regulation 4/2009 ](http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-
content/EN/TXT/?qid=1422886426094&uri=URISERV:jl0024) (also known as ‘the
Maintenance Regulation’). Its objective is to help a maintenance creditor
(applicant) to establish easily, quickly and generally free of charge, an
order which can be enforced throughout the European Union. It does this by
providing for common rules in relation to jurisdiction, applicable law,
recognition, enforcement, cooperation and standardised documents. It covers
maintenance obligations which arise from:

  * Family relationships 
  * Parentage 
  * Marriage or affinity 

It means that a person who has an order for the payment of maintenance given
in an Irish court is in a position to look for recovery of that amount in
another EU country. The same service is available to those in other EU member
states who are seeking recovery of maintenance against debtors (respondents)
living in Ireland.

Under the Regulation, each member state has a Central Authority. The Central
Authority in Ireland is the [ Department of Justice
](http://www.justice.ie/en/JELR/Pages/WP15000151) . The central authorities
co-operate with each other in facilitating the operation of the Regulation.
They also assist individuals in relation to applications available under the
Regulation, particularly with regard to the transmission and receipt of
applications, the initiation of related proceedings for the establishment or
modification of maintenance, and for the enforcement of a maintenance
decision.

[ Regulation 805/2004
](http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/justice_freedom_security/judicial_cooperation_in_civil_matters/l33190_en.htm)
of 21 April 2004 created a European Enforcement Order for uncontested orders –
including maintenance orders – that came into effect in Ireland on 21 October
2005. Its provisions for maintenance orders were replaced by the Maintenance
Regulation, except for European enforcement orders concerning maintenance
obligations issued by member states that are not bound by the [ 2007 Hague
Protocol ](http://www.hcch.net/index_en.php?act=conventions.text&cid=133) on
the law applicable to maintenance obligations. Only Denmark is not bound by
the 2007 Hague Protocol.

###  Lugano Convention

The European Community signed a treaty (known as the [ new Lugano Convention
](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-
content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:22007A1221\(03\)&from=EN) ) on jurisdiction and
the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters
with Iceland, Norway and Switzerland. The Convention is substantially the same
as Regulation 44/2001 and applies between an EU member state and Iceland,
Norway and Switzerland.

###  UN and Hague Conventions

The [ UN Convention on the Recovery Abroad of Maintenance Payments (the New
York Convention)
](http://treaties.un.org/doc/Publication/UNTS/Volume%201268/volume-1268-A-3850-English.pdf)
was brought into effect for Ireland in November 1995 by the [ Maintenance Act
1994 ](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1994/en/act/pub/0028/index.html) . This
Convention is designed to facilitate the recovery of maintenance by a person
living in one jurisdiction against a person living in another. The full list
of jurisdictions covered by the New York Convention is set out [ here
](https://treaties.un.org/Pages/ViewDetailsIII.aspx?src=TREATY&mtdsg_no=XX-1&chapter=20&Temp=mtdsg3&clang=_en)
.

In 2007, the Hague Conference on Private International Law adopted the
following two international instruments which are designed to facilitate the
international recovery of maintenance:

  * [ 2007 Hague Convention ](http://www.hcch.net/index_en.php?act=conventions.text&cid=131) on the international recovery of child support and other forms of family maintenance. It revises two existing Hague Conventions relating to family support as well as the New York Convention. The [ Convention entered into force ](http://www.hcch.net/index_en.php?act=conventions.status&cid=131) on 1 January 2013. 
  * [ 2007 Hague Protocol ](http://www.hcch.net/index_en.php?act=conventions.text&cid=133) on the law applicable to maintenance obligations. The European Union has applied the Protocol since 2011 on a provisional basis to all its member states except for Denmark. The [ Protocol entered into force ](http://www.hcch.net/index_en.php?act=conventions.status&cid=133) on 1 August 2013. 

If you want to enforce a maintenance order in a country not covered by the
Maintenance Regulation or the Lugano Convention, you should contact the
Central Authority for Maintenance Recovery in the [ Department of Justice
](http://www.justice.ie/en/JELR/Pages/Home) for help – see 'Where to apply'
below. The Department is responsible for transmitting and receiving
maintenance.

There is more information about maintenance in our page on [ maintenance
orders and agreements ](/en/birth-family-relationships/separation-and-
divorce/maintenance-orders-and-agreements/) .  

##  Brexit, the UK and family law matters

On 23 June 2016, the United Kingdom (UK) voted to leave the European Union
(EU). Following a [ transition period
](../government_in_ireland/ireland_and_the_uk/what_is_brexit.en.html#lfcaf2) ,
on 31 January 2020 at 11pm the UK exited the EU. The UK is no longer a member
of the EU.

[ Brexit ](/en/government-in-ireland/ireland-and-the-uk/what-is-brexit/)
affects a number of family law issues with a cross-border element. So, for
example, there may be changes in how certain aspects of custody and
maintenance applications are processed when one parent lives in the EU and one
parent lives in the UK. The old basis for recognising UK divorces has also
changed although they will still be recognised in Ireland under new rules.

##  Parental responsibility issues such as custody and access

Any cross-border custody or access orders that were in place at the end of the
transition period remain in effect. So, orders affecting a child with
parents/guardians in both Ireland and the UK are unaffected. If you had an
ongoing case about arrangements for your children at the end of the transition
period, your case will continue under the old rules.

However, if you applied for custody or access after the end of the transition
period, different rules may apply for having the order made or accepted in
Ireland or the UK. In general, cross-border parental responsibility issues
involving Ireland and the UK will be governed by the [ 1996 Hague Protection
of Children Convention
](http://www.hcch.net/index_en.php?act=conventions.text&cid=70) . This is
similar to the system which existed before Brexit and which already applies to
parental responsibility matters with a link to Ireland and to some non-EU
countries such as Australia and Russia.
