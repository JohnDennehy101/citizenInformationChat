##  What is a drone or UAS?

Drones, or Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS), are remotely piloted flying crafts
that a person on land controls with a remote.

Drones vary in size and weight and can come fitted with features such as
cameras or sensors.

If you own or use a drone in Ireland, various laws and rules apply to you,
regardless of whether you use the drone for educational, scientific, or
recreational purposes.

The law on drones also applies to other types of aircraft without a pilot on
board. This includes certain radio-controlled flying models.

If you fly a drone in Ireland that weighs more than 250 grams or has a camera
or sensor, then you must [ register as a drone operator
](https://www.iaa.ie/general-aviation/drones/drone-register) with the Irish
Aviation Authority.

A person may not operate a drone in a manner that may be hazardous to other
aircraft, or that may endanger life or result in damage to property.

##  Registering as a drone operator

Drone-owners must register with the [ Irish Aviation Authority
](https://www.iaa.ie/general-aviation/drones/drone-register) to fly drones
that weigh 250 grams or more. Registration costs €30 and is valid for 2 years.
If you live in the European Union, you only need to register in the country
where you live, and not in each country where you want to fly your drone.

Even if your drone weighs less than 250 grams, you must register if it has a
camera or sensor unless it complies with the [ ‘toy’ directive
](https://www.easa.europa.eu/en/faq/119218) .

To register, you must:

  * Be 16 or over 
  * Set up an account and verify your identity 
  * Take an online training course that lasts about 15 minutes 

If your drone is above 4 kilograms, or if you are planning on doing certain
activities with your drone, you must do [ extra training
](https://www.iaa.ie/general-aviation/drones/rpas-training-facilities/drone-
training---remote-pilot-competency) .

Once you are registered, you must label your drone with your drone operator
ID.

##  Where can I fly my drone?

You should not fly a drone:

  * In a way that could cause a hazard to another aircraft 
  * Near moving aircraft or in an aerodrome traffic circuit 
  * In a manner that poses a risk to people, the environment or property 

Flying drones is separated into 3 categories based on the risk attached:

  * Open category 
  * Specific category 
  * Certified category 

If you are flying a drone that weighs under 25 kilograms within the limits of
the ‘open’ category you do not need a prior permission for the flight. There
are 3 subcategories in the ‘open’ category – A1, A2 and A3.

To fly a drone that weighs more than 25 kilograms, or to fly your drone
outside the ‘open’ category limits, you must apply for an [ Operational
Authorisation ](https://www.easa.europa.eu/en/domains/civil-drones-
rpas/specific-category-civil-drones/operational-authorisation) from the Irish
Aviation Authority.

Make sure to always look at the [ UAS geographical zone map
](https://www.iaa.ie/general-aviation/drones/uas-geographic-zones) before you
fly your drone. There are specific places where you are not allowed to fly
your drone, or you might need permission to fly. Some areas may have certain
restrictions or limitations on flying your drone. The [ IAA website
](https://www.iaa.ie/general-aviation/drones/faqs/geographical-zones) has more
information.

The Irish Aviation Authority or the Gardaí can take away your drone if they
believe it is likely that you will use your drone in breach of the
regulations.

##  Open category

Open category refers to drone flights which are deemed to be a low risk.

Drones in the open category must weigh less than 25 kilograms and have one of
the class identification marks 0, 1, 2, 3 or 4. Drones bought before 1 January
2023 are not required to have a class identification mark.

You can fly an ‘open’ category drone (weighing under 25 kilograms) without
permission, as long as:

  * The drone is no more than 120 metres above the level of the land or water directly below 
  * The drone is not outside your line of sight 
  * The drone is not on or near certain exempted zones such as around hospitals and aerodromes 
  * Your capacity to operate the drone is not affected by the consumption of alcohol or illness. 

There are restrictions in place on:

  * Whether and to what extent you can fly over or near uninvolved people or crowds 
  * Whether you can fly it in urban areas 

The restrictions depend on which subcategory the drone falls into and what
class identification mark it has.

Your drone cannot carry dangerous goods or release any objects.

##  Specific category

The specific category covers drone flights which are deemed to have a medium
level of risk.

Drones that weigh more than 25 kilograms cannot be flown without the explicit
permission of the Irish Aviation Authority. If you want to fly your drone
outside the limits of the ‘open category’ you must inform the Irish Aviation
Authority and generally await an [ Operational Authorisation
](https://www.easa.europa.eu/en/domains/civil-drones-rpas/specific-category-
civil-drones/operational-authorisation) .

##  Incidents involving drones

If your drone is involved in an accident that involves serious injury or death
to a person you must inform:

  * The UAS Division of the Irish Aviation Authority 
  * The Gardaí 
  * The [ Air Accident Investigation Unit ](http://www.aaiu.ie/)

You must also inform the organisations listed above if your drone is involved
in a serious incident that could have resulted in injury or death to someone.

The Gardaí can detain the drone if they suspect there has been a breach of the
law.

A licenced [ aerodrome ](https://www.iaa.ie/general-aviation/aerodromes-5)
operator may use a counter UAS system to disable, disrupt or seize control of
an unmanned aircraft to ensure the safety of civil aviation and the public.

The Irish Aviation Authority can direct a drone operator to get insurance to
cover third parties.

##  Drones and data protection

If you operate a drone that has a camera or listening device which is capable
of recording images or video of persons who could be identified (with or
without zooming in), you could be a [ data controller ](/en/government-in-
ireland/data-protection/controlling-and-processing-personal-data/) under the
General Data Protection Regulations.

Any [ processing of personal data ](/en/government-in-ireland/data-
protection/controlling-and-processing-personal-data/) , including gathering,
exchanging or transmitting digital recordings must be done in accordance with
data protection law. You must have a legal basis to process that personal
data. This could be that you have:

  * The person’s consent, or 
  * A legitimate interest in processing the personal data, and there is only a minimal impact on the person’s rights. 

You may be required to prepare a [ Data Protection Impact Assessment
](https://www.dataprotection.ie/en/organisations/know-your-obligations/data-
protection-impact-assessments) .

You can minimise the impact on the person’s data protection rights by using
blurring software, or some other method of making the person less
identifiable.

Using a drone to take pictures or video as a recreational activity may be
exempt from data protection law, but only if you do not publish the images or
video to an unrestricted audience.

You can read more in the [ Data Protection Commission’s Guidance on the Use of
Drones
](https://www.dataprotection.ie/sites/default/files/uploads/2022-05/Guidance
on the use of drones - May 2022 Final.pdf) .

##  More information

[ EU law ](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-
content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32019R0945&from=EN) regulates the design,
specifications, manufacture, and marketing of unmanned aircraft systems within
the European market.

It also outlines strict rules about potential add-ons and accessories that
operators can purchase and fit into their drones.
