##  What is the Accommodation Recognition Payment?

The Accommodation Recognition Payment (ARP) is a tax-free payment of €800 per
month for each property used to provide accommodation to refugees from
Ukraine. The payment increased to €800 per month from 1 December 2022.

The accommodation must be provided for at least 6 months and meet [ the
required standards ](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/85e79-accommodation-
standards/) .

You cannot get this payment if there is a rental agreement with the person
being hosted. However, the payment is not affected if they contribute towards
costs such as utilities and food.

The ARP can be back dated to 4 March 2022 or from when you started providing
accommodation. The rate of payment was €400 per month until 1 December 2022.

It is not taken into account in the means test for any grants or payments from
the Department of Social Protection or other public bodies.

##  How to qualify for the Accommodation Recognition Payment

To qualify for the Accommodation Recognition Payment (ARP) you must:

  * Be aged 18 or over 
  * Be the owner of, or a tenant in, the accommodation being provided and have the consent of any other owners or tenants 
  * Be providing (or have provided) accommodation for at least 6 months to at least one person covered by the [ EU Temporary Protection Directive ](/en/moving-country/asylum-seekers-and-refugees/the-asylum-process-in-ireland/temporary-protection-directive/)
  * Have at least one person who is covered by the EU Temporary Protection Directive living in the property on the last day of the calendar month to get a payment for that month 

Garda vetting is not required.

The accommodation must be in Ireland and meet the required standards. These
standards apply even if you are providing the accommodation in your own home.
You can find [ more detail on the required standards
](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/85e79-accommodation-standards/) and a
useful [ checklist for your property
](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/85e79-accommodation-standards/#checklist)
.

and the [ Christmas 2023 absence policy

do not apply to refugees from Ukraine living hosted accommodation.

##  Do I have to wait 6 months before applying for the ARP?

You do not have to wait 6 months before applying for the ARP. However, when
you apply you must make a commitment to provide the accommodation for at least
6 months.

###  Do I have to repay the ARP if I provide accommodation for less than 6
months?

You must make a commitment to provide the accommodation for 6 months. However,
if you are unable to meet the 6-month commitment, you do not have to repay the
ARP paid to you for the months that the person covered by the EU Temporary
Protection Directive lived in your accommodation.

You must notify the Department of Social Protection that the person has left
your accommodation.

##  Rate of the Accommodation Recognition Payment

The Accommodation Recognition Payment (ARP) is a set monthly rate of €800 per
property from 1 December 2022. It was previously €400 per month.

If there are other costs and you are experiencing financial difficulty, you
can apply for the [ Additional Needs Payment
](https://www.gov.ie/en/service/4eb45-additional-needs-payment/) . The
Additional Needs Payment is decided on a case-by-case basis.

###  Getting paid

The ARP is paid on the second Tuesday of each month.

It will be paid by Electronic Fund Transfer (EFT) to the bank account on your
application. Payments can be made to an Irish, UK, SEPA, N26 or Revolut bank
account.
