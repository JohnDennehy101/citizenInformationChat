##  Introduction

Grandparents play an important role in their grandchild’s life. However, some
grandparents have difficulty seeing their grandchildren and spending time with
them. They can find themselves excluded from the lives of their grandchildren,
and this can be very upsetting for them and for the children involved. This
can happen for many reasons, for example, if the relationship between the
grandparent and parent has broken down.

Grandparents do not have automatic rights in relation to their grandchildren,
but there are steps you can take to improve your level of contact with them.

##  How do I request more time with my grandchildren?

You should first speak to the child’s parents or guardians. Negotiation should
be explored, to try and come to an arrangement so that you can spend time with
your grandchildren.

If no agreement can be reached, you should consider [ family mediation
](/en/birth-family-relationships/separation-and-divorce/family-mediation-
separating-couples/) . This is where a trained independent professional,
called a _mediator_ , helps you and the parents come to an agreement in a safe
space. Mediation addresses the needs and interests of everyone involved.

Mediation can have better long-term effects on the family as a whole, as both
sides take ownership of the arrangement they come to. The process is much less
confrontational than the matter being dealt with in court.

If mediation is not successful, you can apply to the court for _access_ to
your grandchildren.

In certain situations, you can apply for _custody_ or _guardianship_ . Read
about access, custody, and guardianship below.

##  Applying for access to a grandchild

If you are having difficulty maintaining contact with your grandchildren, you
can apply for _access_ through [ your local District Court
](https://www.courts.ie/content/find-us) . Access means you will have a legal
right to direct contact with the child, which may include overnight stays
(sleepovers).

Before granting your application, the court will consider:

  * Your existing connection with the child 
  * Any risk of harmful disruption to the child's life 
  * The wishes of the child’s parents or guardians 
  * The wishes of the child if they are capable of forming their own views 

To make an application for access, you must complete a form called _Form
58.19_ and submit it to the court. You can [ download Form 58.19 (docx)
](https://www.courts.ie/acc/alfresco/9db36de7-9639-4a97-8689-b1d7f588a37f/Notice%20of%20application%20under%20section%2011b%20for%20an%20order%20giving%20access%20-%20Guardianship%20of%20Children%20Acts%2C%201964%20to%201997%20No.%2058.19.docx/doc/1)
from Courts.ie.

The court will always put your grandchild’s needs first. The child’s best
interests are set out in [ Section 63 of the Children and Family Relationships
Act 2015
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2015/act/9/section/63/enacted/en/html) .
The rules about access are set out in [ Section 11B of the Guardianship of
Infants Act 1964, as amended
](https://revisedacts.lawreform.ie/eli/1964/act/7/revised/en/html#SEC11B) .

You should get professional legal advice before making an application. See
‘Getting legal advice and other supports’ below, or [ visit our page on access
to children ](/en/birth-family-relationships/cohabiting-couples/access-to-
children-cohabiting-couples/) .

##  Applying for custody of a grandchild

If you have _custody_ of a child, you are responsible for their day-to-day
care, accommodation and upbringing.

Any relative, including a grandparent, can apply to their [ local District
Court ](https://www.courts.ie/content/find-us) for custody of a child.

Usually, the court will only grant you custody if it has the parents’ or
guardians’ consent. However, the court can _dispense with the consent_ (decide
that the parents’ consent is not needed) if a custody order is in the child’s
best interests.

If you are granted custody of your grandchild and they are to live with you,
the court can _specify_ (give you details) of the contact, if any, that the
child must have with their parent(s).

You should get professional legal advice before making an application for
custody. See ‘Getting legal advice and other supports’ below. You can also
find more information in our page [ custody of a child ](/en/birth-family-
relationships/cohabiting-couples/custody-of-children-cohabiting-couples/) .

###  Kinship care

In some circumstances, grandparents, other relatives or a family friend may
take on the full-time care of children and young people, when parents are not
able to care for them. Sometimes this is referred to as a private family
arrangement or ‘kinship care’. Most kinship care arrangements are informal
unlike relative foster care which is a formal arrangement. Information and
support for kinship carers in Ireland is available at [ kinshipcare.ie
](https://www.kinshipcare.ie/) .

###  Getting financial support

If you are the main carer of the child, and the child is not being properly
maintained financially by either or both parents, you can apply to the
District Court for a [ maintenance order ](/en/birth-family-
relationships/separation-and-divorce/maintenance-orders-and-agreements/) .
This means that, if the court grants your application, the parent(s) must give
you money towards the care of the child.

You may also be eligible to claim the [ Guardian’s Payment ](/en/social-
welfare/death-related-benefits/guardian-and-orphan-payments/) from the
Department of Social Protection.

It is not necessary to be a legally appointed guardian. You may get this
payment if the child lives with you, and you are responsible for their care.

##  Becoming a guardian

_Guardianship_ means you have legal responsibility for certain decisions and
to carry out duties in relation to a child's upbringing. For example,
decisions about their medical or dental treatment, or their religious or
cultural upbringing.

As a grandparent, or other relative carer, you can apply to your local
District Court for guardianship if:

  * You have provided the day-to-day care of the child for at least 12 months in a row **and**
  * There is no parent or guardian willing (or able) to carry out guardianship responsibilities in respect of the child 

You can also apply for guardianship if the child’s parents die without
appointing a guardian in their will.

A person can apply for guardianship up until a child reaches 18 years of age.

To apply for guardianship, you must complete a form called a ‘Notice of
application by an eligible person to be appointed a guardian’. This form,
which is sometimes called a _Form 58.30_ , can be submitted to [ your local
District Court ](https://www.courts.ie/content/find-us) . [ Download the
‘Notice Of Application’ (docx)
](https://www.courts.ie/acc/alfresco/d88dddf8-06c9-48a4-9f31-15927d7ee954/Notice%20of%20application%20by%20an%20eligible%20person%20to%20be%20appointed%20a%20guardian%20-%20Guardianship%20of%20Infants%20Act%201964%2C%20section%206C%20%28inserted%20by%20section%2049%20of%20the%20Children%20and%20Family%20Relationships%20Act%202015%29%20No.%2058.30.docx/doc/1)
from Courts.ie.

You should get professional legal advice before making an application. See
‘Getting legal advice and other supports’ below.

###  Your guardianship duties

The court will decide the extent of your guardianship rights and
responsibilities. You may have the same duties as the child’s parents, or only
certain duties.

The court can also remove your guardianship rights at a later date if it is in
the child’s best interests.

###  Temporary guardianship

A parent can nominate you to act as a _temporary guardian_ of their child if
they are unable to carry out their own guardianship duties – for example, if
they become seriously ill or injured.

The parent must [ complete a special form (pdf) ](https://www.treoir.ie/wp-
content/uploads/2018/03/nomination-form.pdf) to nominate you and they can set
out any wishes they have regarding the temporary guardianship.

You (the nominated person) must then apply to the District Court if the parent
cannot carry out their parental role due to illness or injury. Your specific
rights as a temporary guardian will be explained in the court order. This is
usually the same as the parent’s wishes, as set out in their nomination form.

##  I was granted access or custody, but still cannot see my grandchild

If you already have an _access order_ or a _custody order_ from the court, but
you are still not getting contact with your grandchild, you can seek an
_enforcement order_ from the court.

An enforcement order is a further legal instruction to the parents or
guardians that they must allow you to see your grandchild, at the specific
times set out in the order. The enforcement order may allow additional access
to compensate for lost time, reimbursement for any wasted expenses or require
those involved to attend a parenting programme or counselling.

If the parents or guardians refuse to comply with an access or custody order,
they can be fined up to €2,500, go to prison for up to 12 months, or both.

To apply for an enforcement order, you must [ send a completed Form 58.43
(docx)
](https://www.courts.ie/acc/alfresco/4bde2cb9-2621-4f19-9d59-3996d328d27d/Notice%20of%20application%20for%20enforcement%20order%20-%20Guardianship%20of%20Infants%20Act%201964%2C%20section%2018A%281%29%20No.%2058.43.docx/docx/)
, to your local District Court.

##  I was granted access or custody, but my circumstances have changed

The terms set out in your _access order_ or _custody order_ do not have to
last forever.

If your circumstances change, you can apply to the court for a _variation
order_ . This means the court will update some (or all) aspects of the access
or custody order. You can also ask the court to cancel the original access or
custody order altogether.

To apply for a variation order, you must [ send a completed Form 58.21 (docx)
](https://www.courts.ie/acc/alfresco/88eba56b-576e-4550-94fa-3df676f18856/Notice%20of%20application%20to%20vary%20-%20discharge%20order%20-%20Guardianship%20of%20Children%20Acts%201964%20to%201997%20No.%2058.21.docx/docx/1)
to your local District Court.

##  Appealing the court’s decision

The District Court makes decisions about access, custody and guardianship
applications based on the child’s best interests.

If you are not satisfied with the court’s decision, you can make an appeal
**within 14 days** of the decision being made.

To make an appeal, you must complete a form called a ‘Notice of Appeal to
District Court’. This form, which is sometimes called a _Form 101.1_ , lets
you explain your reasons for appeal. [ Download the ‘Notice Of Appeal to
Circuit Court’ (docx)
](https://www.courts.ie/acc/alfresco/8c42836a-39d4-49c0-a704-b2118b609a19/Notice%20Of%20Appeal%20To%20The%20Circuit%20Court%20%28Civil%20Proceedings%29%20No.%20101.1.docx/docx/1)
from Courts.ie.

You should get professional legal advice before making an appeal. See ‘Getting
legal advice and other supports’ below.
