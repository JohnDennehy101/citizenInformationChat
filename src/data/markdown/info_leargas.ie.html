##  European Year of Skills

2023 is The European Year of Skills (EYS). It is all about recognizing skills
development and helping people gain skills for employment, enrichment, and
enjoyment. To celebrate the EYS, Léargas have focused on capturing impact
stories, and showcasing how EU programmes promote a life-long learning
mindset. Some stories were shared at our annual flagship event, The Gathering;
others you can hear by watching our Skills for Life video. We've also launched
an exciting Skills for Life competition (open until August 2023). Visit our
News section for all the details!
