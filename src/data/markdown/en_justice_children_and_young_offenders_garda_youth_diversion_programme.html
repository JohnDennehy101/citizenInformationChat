  * Eligibility for the Garda Youth Diversion Programme

##  Introduction

The Garda Youth Diversion Programme aims to prevent young offenders and
children involved in anti-social behaviour in Ireland from committing further
offences and entering into the adult criminal justice system.

The programme helps young people under 18 years of age.

While the age of criminal responsibility for children is 12 years of age, the
programme can involve children as young as 10 years old.

When a young person comes to the notice of the Gardaí because of their
behaviour, they may be dealt with through the Diversion Programme.

The details of the Youth Diversion Programme are found in [ Part 4 of the
Children Act 2001
](http://revisedacts.lawreform.ie/eli/2001/act/24/section/17/revised/en/html)
, as amended.

##  Garda Youth Diversion Bureau and JLOs

The Garda Youth Diversion Bureau is responsible for the operation of the
Diversion Programme.

The Bureau liaises with voluntary and statutory bodies:

  * Regarding the welfare of young people, 
  * Developing contacts with school attendance officers, 
  * Formulating crime-prevention programmes for children at risk and 
  * Recording and examining cases of children missing from home. 

###  **Garda Juvenile Liaison Officers (JLOs)**

The Diversion Programme is administered by specially trained Gardaí called
Garda Juvenile Liaison Officers (JLOs).

These Gardaí are specially trained to deal with:

  * Young people and their families in relation to crime-prevention 
  * The operation of the diversion programme 
  * All other areas involving young people and the criminal justice system. 

Each Garda Division in Ireland has JLOs who maintain informal contacts with
young people at risk. They also liaise with teachers, Tusla staff, school
attendance officers and other Gardaí in their local area.

##  How the Youth Diversion Programme works

###

Young people who commit criminal offences or anti-social behaviour can be
dealt with by a _caution_ under the Diversion Programme, which informs them
that they have committed an offence or anti-social behaviour. This is instead
of the formal process of charge and prosecution for offences or an anti-social
behaviour order.

A caution is a warning by An Garda Síochána against committing the offending
behaviour or similar behaviour again.

###  **Steps in** **the Garda Youth** **Diversion Programme after admission:**

**Step 1:** The child is cautioned by a Garda

**Step 2** : The child is placed under the supervision of a Juvenile Liaison
Officer (JLO)

**Step 3** : A conference or meeting can be held with the child, parent or
guardian, JLO and victim (if appropriate) to discuss the behaviour and
possibly to mediate between the child and victim.

**Step 4** : An action plan can be drawn up for the child

###

##  Eligibility for the Garda Youth Diversion Programme

###  **Before admission to the programme**

A Garda investigating the young person's behaviour assesses if the person is
suitable for inclusion in the programme and prepares a report.

Before the young person is considered for admission, they must:

  * Admit responsibility for their criminal or anti-social behaviour 
  * Consent to be admitted to the programme 
  * Consent to be supervised by JLO, if necessary 

It’s important to note, the final decision of whether or not a young person is
cautioned lies not with the Director of the Diversion Programme and not with
the referring Garda.

###  Factors considered for admission to a diversion programme

In making their decision, the Director may consider:

  * The nature of the offence 
  * The views of the victim 
  * The interests of society 
  * The views of the arresting Garda 
  * The views of the JLO 
  * The attitude and views of the young person who offended 
  * The views of the young person’s parents or guardians 
  * Whether an apology has been made 
  * Whether or not something can be done to repair any harm caused 
  * The child’s previous involvement in the programme 

If a child is not admitted to the programme, they may be prosecuted or an [
anti-social behaviour order ](/en/justice/children-and-young-offenders/anti-
social-behaviour-by-children/) may be sought.

###  After a child is admitted to the programme

**Written notice**

The Director directs a JLO to give notice in writing to the parents or
guardians of a child who is admitted to the programme. This notice includes:

  * The type of criminal or anti-social behaviour the child will be cautioned for 
  * If the caution will be formal or informal. 

The parents or guardians are obliged to attend the cautioning process.

The Director of the Garda Youth Diversion Programme ensures the written notice
is in language the parents or guardians can understand. The notice may be
given in the first language of the parents or guardians if appropriate.

The notice will also be available in Irish for children from Gaeltacht areas
or those whose first language is Irish.

###  **Protections when in** **the Garda Youth Diversion** **Programme?**

Any child who has been admitted to the Diversion Programme is protected from:

  * Prosecution for the criminal behaviour that caused their admission, or 
  * Application for an anti-social behaviour for the anti-social behaviour that caused their admission to the programme. 

If the child accepts responsibility for their behaviour for which they have
been admitted to the programme, such acceptance cannot be used in any criminal
proceedings against that child unless the child is convicted for behaviour
which occurred after their admission to the programme.

**The child's identity is protected**

The identity of a child who is admitted to or considered for admission to the
programme is not disclosed publicly. A person who publishes or broadcasts such
information is guilty of an offence.

##  Cautions for young offenders

###  Two types of caution

Two types of caution may be given to a child

  * Formal 
  * Informal 

The Director of the Programme decides whether to administer a formal or
informal caution. Generally, the decision depends on the seriousness of the
child’s criminal behaviour.

Formal cautions are more serious than informal cautions.

If a child has previously been formally cautioned, they cannot be informally
cautioned on a later occasion.

###  How is a formal caution delivered?

The formal caution is given by a JLO, a Garda inspector or a more senior
officer. The following people must be present when a caution is given:

  * The child 
  * The child’s parents or guardians 
  * A JLO (if the JLO is not administering the caution). 

The Director of the Programme may also invite the victim of the crime to
attend.

There is no specific wording or procedure for administering the caution. The
officer who gives the caution, however, normally discusses the behaviour and
highlights to the child the seriousness of their actions.

The child may be invited to apologise to the victim and, where appropriate,
make financial or other amends to the victim.

The formal caution normally takes place in a Garda station to highlight the
seriousness of the situation to the child.

###  How is an informal caution delivered?

An informal caution is for less serious criminal behaviour and may be given at
the child’s home or in a Garda station.

It is administered by a JLO. The only people who must attend when an informal
caution is given are the parents or guardians and the child.

##  Supervision during the Youth Diversion Programme

Every child who receives a formal caution through the Garda Diversion
Programme is placed under the supervision of a JLO for 12 months. This can be
changed in certain circumstances.

###  **Who decides on the level of supervision?**

The level of supervision is normally decided by the JLO. When deciding the
level of supervision, they consider the following matters:

  * Seriousness of the child’s behaviour 
  * Level of support given to, and the level of control of, the child by the parents or guardians 
  * Likelihood of the child committing further offences or anti-social behaviour 
  * Directions from the Director regarding the appropriate level of supervision 

Generally, a child who gets an informal caution is not placed under the
supervision of a JLO. However, in exceptional circumstances, a young person
given an informal caution can be placed under the supervision of a JLO for 6
months.

###  What is JLO supervision?

Supervision normally involves the JLO closely monitoring the child’s behaviour
in relation to the caution.

The young person may have to agree to:

  * Engage in certain activities 
  * Attend a local youth project, or 
  * Report on particular occasions to the JLO or another Garda. 

##  Youth diversion conferences

###  What is a Diversion Programme conference?

The Diversion Programme can hold a meeting (or conference) to discuss the
welfare of a child admitted to the programme.

The conference may:

  * Mediate between the child and the victim (where appropriate) in line with the terms of the programme. 
  * Formulate an action plan for the child. 

Conferences must also uphold the concerns of the victim and consider their
interests.

The conference aims to:

  * Establish why the child became involved in the behaviour that gave rise to their admission to the programme 
  * Discuss how the parents, guardians, family members, relatives or other people can prevent the child from becoming involved in such behaviour 
  * Review the child’s behaviour since their admission to the programme, where appropriate 

These conferences are established in law under [ Section 29 of the Children
Act 2001 ](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2001/en/act/pub/0024/sec0029.html)

###  Who runs the conference?

The Director of the Diversion Programme will decide whether to hold a
conference.

Before the decision:

  * The Juvenile Liaison Officer (JLO) supervising a child recommends in writing that a conference is held. 
  * The child’s parents or guardians must agree to the conference 

The child's consent is not required but their views must be obtained on the
matter.

The Director must appoint a facilitator to convene and chair the conference.
The facilitator person must be the supervising JLO or another Garda.

###  Who attends the conference?

The conference must be attended by:

  * The child 
  * Their parents or guardians 
  * The facilitator 

If appropriate, the facilitator may invite:

  * The victim and their family members if their attendance would contribute to the conference 
  * Other family members and relatives 
  * Representatives from Tusla, the Probation Service and the child’s school. 

###  What does the conference consider?

The conference considers:

  * The level of supervision the child needs 
  * If the existing level of supervision should change 

Normally a conference only occurs if the supervision of the child is not
having the desired effect and the child’s behaviour isn’t improving.

###  **Action plan**

When a conference is called, an action plan is normally agreed for the child.
The action plan must be agreed by all those present at the conference, unless
the facilitator believes a person’s refusal to consent is unreasonable.

An action plan is usually an outcome of the conference but is not compulsory.

###  What is in an action plan

An action plan may include:

  * An apology (verbally or in writing or both) by the child to the victim 
  * Financial or other reparation to any victim 
  * Participation by the child in a suitable sporting or recreational activity 
  * Attendance by the child at school or a place of work 
  * Participation by the child in a suitable training, educational course or a programme that does not interfere with any work or school schedule of the child 
  * The child being at home at certain times 
  * The child staying away from specific places or people (or both) 
  * Initiatives within the child’s family and community to help prevent the child committing further offences or anti-social behaviour 
  * Any other matter in the child’s best interests or would make the child more aware of the consequences of their behaviour. 

**Action plan start and review dates**

The final agreed action plan starts on the date it is signed by the
facilitator, the child (if possible) and one other person present.

The action plan is reviewed at any time within six months from the date the
plan is signed.

The conference and any action plan are reported to the Director of the
Diversion Programme. The Director then decides if they need to vary any period
of supervision.

##  Schools programme and youth diversion projects

###  **Garda Youth Diversion Projects**

The Youth Diversion Programme is supported by a network of Garda Youth
Diversion Projects (GYDPs). The projects give the children opportunities to
engage in activities such as education, employment training, sport, art and
music. Most projects operate outside of school hours, although activities may
also be planned during the daytime.

The projects are community based, multi-agency youth crime prevention
initiatives that aim to divert young people from anti-social or criminal
behaviour.

There are over 100 projects managed by community-based organisations as part
of the programme. These include Foróige, Crosscare, Extern and other
independent agencies. You can find programme locations on [ this map.

###  Schools Programme

The Gardaí run the Schools Programme to discourage young people at school
becoming involved in criminal behaviour.

Gardaí visit classrooms and run projects and trips with pupils in 5th class in
[ primary schools ](/en/education/primary-and-post-primary-education/going-to-
primary-school/starting-primary-school/) .

A programme for [ post-primary schools ](/en/education/primary-and-post-
primary-education/going-to-post-primary-school/starting-post-primary-school/)
has been developed to run alongside the [ Social, Personal and Health
Education syllabus for Junior Cycle ](/en/education/primary-and-post-primary-
education/going-to-post-primary-school/junior-cycle/) .

As well as making young people aware of the dangers of criminal behaviour, the
Schools Programme shows children the positive side of the work of the Gardaí
and encourages good relations between pupils and the Gardaí.
