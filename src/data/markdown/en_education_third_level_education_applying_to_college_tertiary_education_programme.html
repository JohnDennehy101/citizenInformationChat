##  What is the tertiary education programme?

The [ tertiary education programme ](https://www.gov.ie/en/policy-
information/fd38f-tertiary-programmes/) is a new way to get a degree at third
level.

How the programme works:

  1. You start your course in a further education college, usually an Education and Training Board (ETB). You will attend the ETB for 1 to 2 years depending on your course. There are no fees when you attend an ETB. 
  2. You then progress to third level to complete your degree in a higher education college or university. There are course fees when you move to third level, but you may qualify for [ free fees ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/education/third-level-education/fees-and-supports-for-third-level-education/fees/) and a [ student grant ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/education/third-level-education/fees-and-supports-for-third-level-education/student-grant-scheme/) . 

All courses lead to a degree at Level 7 or 8 on the [ National Framework of
Qualifications (NFQ) ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/education/third-
level-education/colleges-and-qualifications/fet-qualifications/#828dc6) .

[ Step-back awards ](https://www.gov.ie/en/policy-information/fd38f-tertiary-
programmes/) recognising the learning completed can be provided to students
who donâ€™t finish the programme.

##  Do I need Leaving Cert or CAO points?

No. You do not apply through the [ CAO
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/education/third-level-
education/applying-to-college/application-procedures-and-entry-requirements/)
and you do not need the same [ Leaving Certificate
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/education/state-examinations/leaving-
certificate/) points. However, there are entry requirements to get on a course
with the [ Tertiary education programme ](https://www.gov.ie/en/policy-
information/fd38f-tertiary-programmes/) . Each course has its own entry
requirements.

You can find out about the course and the [ entry requirements from the course
provider or coordinator ](https://nto.hea.ie/courses/) . They can give you
more information about what you might need to include with your application.

##  What course can I do with the tertiary education programme?

Over 40 different courses starting in 2024.

These courses include degrees in:

  * Business 
  * Nursing 
  * Engineering 
  * Construction 
  * Music and Sound Production 
  * Software Development 

You can find out more about the [ courses available as part of the tertiary
education programme ](https://nto.hea.ie/courses/) and where they take place.

Contact the [ Adult Educational Guidance and Information Service
](https://www.etbi.ie/fet-guidance/contact-a-local-adult-guidance-service/)
for guidance on all the education options available to you, including the
tertiary education programme.

##  Tertiary course fees

You start your course in a further education college, usually an Education and
Training Board (ETB). There is no tuition fee or student contribution to pay
during your course in the ETB.

When you progress to a third-level college, tuition fees and the student
contribution fee will apply. You should check if you qualify for [ free fees
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/education/third-level-education/fees-
and-supports-for-third-level-education/fees/#lb01ca) or a [ student grant
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/education/third-level-education/fees-
and-supports-for-third-level-education/student-grant-scheme/) .

Other financial supports for people returning to education include:

  * The [ Student Assistance Fund ](https://hea.ie/funding-governance-performance/funding/student-finance/student-assistance-fund/)
  * [ Back to Education Allowance ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/social-welfare-payments/back-to-education/back-to-education-allowance/)
  * The [ part-time fee scheme for undergraduate students ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/education/third-level-education/fees-and-supports-for-third-level-education/part-time-fee-scheme-for-undergraduate-courses/)
