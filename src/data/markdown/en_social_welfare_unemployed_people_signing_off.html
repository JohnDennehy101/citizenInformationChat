Signing off when you start work

#  Signing off when you start work

  * What is signing off? 
  * Close your jobseeker’s payment online 

##  What is signing off?

Signing off is when you contact the Department of Social Protection to stop
claiming a jobseeker’s payment or credits.

If you are getting [ Jobseeker's Allowance ](/en/social-welfare/unemployed-
people/jobseekers-allowance/) , [ Jobseeker's Benefit ](/en/social-
welfare/unemployed-people/jobseekers-benefit/) or [ credits ](/en/social-
welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/social-insurance-prsi/credited-social-
insurance-contributions/) you are registered as a jobseeker by the Department
of Social Protection.

If you are registered as a jobseeker (in other words, [ signing-on
](/en/social-welfare/unemployed-people/signing-on/) ), you should inform [
your local Intreo Centre or Social Welfare Branch Office
](https://www.gov.ie/en/directory/category/e1f4b5-intreo-offices/) of the date
you are going to start work.

This will ensure that you can get any payment due to you up to the date you
start work.

You can also get advice about possibly keeping some of your existing benefits
and supports when you return to work. When you start work you may be entitled
to additional benefits, for example, [ Working Family Payment ](/en/social-
welfare/families-and-children/working-family-payment/) .

Find out more about [ Jobseeker’s Benefit and work ](/en/social-
welfare/social-welfare-payments-and-work/jobseekers-benefit-and-work/) .

##  Close your jobseeker’s payment online

You can close your Jobseeker's Allowance or Jobseeker’s Benefit payment on
MyWelfare.ie. To do this you will need a [ MyGovID ](/en/government-in-
ireland/how-government-works/egovernment/mygovid/) account.
