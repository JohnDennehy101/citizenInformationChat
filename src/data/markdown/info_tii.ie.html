###  **TII's purpose is to provide sustainable transport infrastructure and
services, delivering a better quality of  
life, supporting economic growth and  
respecting the environment. **

TII is a state agency under the aegis of the Department of Transport, working
at both national and regional level, in partnership with Local Authorities
regarding national roads and greenways, and the National Transport Authority
(NTA) regarding light rail and metro.

TII was established through a merger of the National Roads Authority (NRA) and
the Railway Procurement Agency (RPA) under the Roads Act 2015, and was set up
to deliver and operate safe and efficient light rail and national road
networks.

In 2021, TII was delegated additional functions in relation to active travel
and greenways.

At TII we are building a more sustainable economy and a better quality of life
for everyone. To learn more about our organisation and the valuable work that
we do to keep people and goods moving safely and reliably every day, click on

###  **Luas Benefits Report 2024**

To coincide with the celebration of 20 years of Luas, TII has published a [
Luas Benefits Report 2024 ](/media/y5el3m2r/luas-benefits-report-2024.pdf
"Luas Benefits 2024") on the positive contribution that Luas has made to
living, working and socialising in Dublin over the last twenty years.

Luas has proven to be a flagship infrastructure project in Ireland,
consistently delivered both on time and on budget. The report provides an
understanding of what is made possible by the provision of high quality,
accessible and zero emissions public transport, and highlights the positive
impact Luas has had on enabling compact growth, economic and social vitality,
and sustainable mobility.

Luas has been a catalyst to creating a more sustainable, connected, and
productive capital. It has redrawn the map of Dublin, transformed people’s
lives and improved the quality of life of those it serves. Luas connects
communities and places, supports the delivery of new development and growth,
and provides a high-quality connection to key economic centres across the
region. Luas has delivered for the people and the economy of Dublin, which has
been the engine behind Ireland’s economic growth.

###  **TII Bypass Impact Evaluation - Macroom**

TII is carrying out a series of bypass impact evaluations, to understand the
impacts in local towns and villages bypassed by TII-funded roads projects.
These look at impacts on traffic volumes, motorised and active modes, local
businesses, accessibility and social inclusion, safety, and the local
environment. The first comparison of data from one year after the bypass
opening against baseline data, for the town of Macroom in County Cork, is now
completed and reported on in ‘TII Bypass Impact Evaluations - Macroom’.
