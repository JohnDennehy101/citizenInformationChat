#  Case Study: How income from work affects Jobseeker's Allowance

  * Case study 

##  Case study

###  **This case study shows the effect of work on Jobseeker's Allowance (2024
rates)**

John is living with his partner Mary and their 2 children. He recently lost
his job as a barman but has managed to get some part-time work in a local
restaurant. He is working 2 days a week.

His assessable earnings for social welfare purposes are €110 per week
(assessable earnings are gross earnings less deductions for [ PRSI
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-
system/social-insurance-prsi/social-insurance/) , superannuation and union
dues.)

Mary cares for her mother, who lives nearby, and is getting full-rate [
Carer's Allowance ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-
welfare/social-welfare-payments/carers/carers-allowance/) . She is also
getting [ Child Benefit ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-
welfare/social-welfare-payments/families-and-children/child-benefit/) for each
of their 2 children aged under 12.

John wants to go back to bar work and has applied to a number of local pubs
and hotels. He heard that he can get [ Jobseeker's Allowance (JA)
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/social-welfare-
payments/unemployed-people/jobseekers-allowance/) for the days that he is not
working and wants to know how much JA he is entitled to.

Other than Mary's social welfare payments and John's part-time work they have
no other income. However, they have savings of €17,500.

He is entitled to JA only for periods of unemployment. The minimum period a
person must be unemployed to receive JA is 4 days in a period of 7 consecutive
days.

####  **Jobseeker’s Allowance weekly rate calculation**

Jobseeker's Allowance rate is **€278** (note 1, see below).

**Less** average weekly means of **€21** (note 2, see below).

Total Jobseeker's Allowance weekly rate is **€257**

###  **Note 1**

Calculate the maximum JA payment John would be entitled to if he didn’t have
any means. John’s maximum payment is €278.

This is made up of his personal payment of €232 and €23 for each of his 2
children (John gets a half-rate [ increase for a child dependant)
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-
system/claiming-a-social-welfare-payment/claiming-and-increase-in-your-
payment-for-a-child-dependant/) .

His wife also gets a half-rate increase for child dependants with her Carer's
Allowance payment.

John will not get an [ increase for a qualified adult
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-
system/claiming-a-social-welfare-payment/claiming-an-increase-in-your-social-
welfare-payment-for-an-adult-dependant/) because Mary is getting her own
social welfare payment, full-rate Carer’s Allowance (John could claim an
increase for a qualified Adult, if Mary agrees to getting [ half-rate Carer's
Allowance ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/social-
welfare-payments/carers/half-rate-carers-allowance/) – the family can check to
see if this would be of greater benefit to them).

###  **Note 2**

###  **Work**

John's average assessable weekly earnings are €110.

First you must find out if John's weekly means disqualify him from getting JA.
€20 per day from casual work (up to a maximum of €60) will be deducted from
his average assessable weekly earnings and then 60% of the balance will be
assessed as his weekly means.

€110 – €40 (2 days worked) = €70 x 60% = €42

John's weekly means from employment of €42 is less than the maximum amount he
would be entitled to for his circumstances (€278).

Now you know he is entitled to a certain amount of Jobseeker's Allowance the
next step is to calculate the **actual amount** of Jobseeker's Allowance he is
entitled to. To do this you must calculate his **'assessable daily
earnings'.**

He is entitled to JA only for periods of unemployment. The minimum period a
person must be unemployed in order to receive JA is 4 days in a period of 7
consecutive days. John has 4 consecutive days of unemployment. He is employed
for 2 days.

John's average assessable daily earnings are (€110 ÷ 2 days work) = €55.

Less disregard for day worked €55 - €20 = €35

60% of his assessable daily earnings of €35 = €21

Weekly means is €21 x 2 (number of days worked) = €42

John's weekly means from employment is €42

Allowance and income from work ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-

####  **Capital**

His savings are not taken into account because they are below the €20,000
threshold.

](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-
system/means-test-for-social-welfare-payments/how-to-assess-your-means-from-
capital-for-social-welfare-payments/) .

###  **Cash income**

His wife's Carer's Allowance and Child Benefit are not taken into account in
the assessment of means. As she is getting her own social welfare personal
payment (Carer's Allowance), he cannot claim a qualified adult increase for
her.

](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-
system/means-test-for-social-welfare-payments/cash-income-not-included-in-the-
social-welfare-means-test/) .

###  **Weekly means**

His means of €42 is halved because his wife is getting a social welfare
payment.

You can read more about the [ means test
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-
system/means-test-for-social-welfare-payments/means-test/) for social welfare
payments.

**Therefore, his total means is assessed as €21.**
