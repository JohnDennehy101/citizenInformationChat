](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/4d9f8-how-to-upload-documents-on-
mywelfare/) .

###  **Other online social welfare services**

You can also use the MyWelfare website to:

  * Make appointments for a Personal Public Service number, or a Public Services Card 
  * Update your address details 
  * Update your bank details 
  * Request a payment statement or a contribution statement 
  * Close a jobseeker’s claim

  * See how taking up employment may affect your social welfare payment (using the ‘ [ Benefit of Work Estimator ](https://services.mywelfare.ie/en/topics/out-of-work-payments/benefit-of-work-estimator/) ’) 

You can also use [ the pension calculation tool
](https://pensionsauthority.ie/lifecycle/useful-resources/pension-calculator/)
on the Pensions Authority website.

##  Accessing MyWelfare online services

To use MyWelfare online services, you must create a [ MyGovID account
](https://www.mygovid.ie/en-IE/HowDoISignUp) . This is a secure online
identity-verification service.

Your MyGovID account lets you access a range of government services online, as
well as social welfare services.

There are 2 types of MyGovID account:

  * A basic MyGovID account 
  * A verified MyGovID account 

##  Setting up a basic MyGovID account

A [ basic MyGovID account ](https://www.mygovid.ie/en-IE/HowDoISignUp) lets
you access services like:

  * Booking appointments online for a PPS number and Public Services Card 
  * Request a statement of your PRSI contributions. 

To create your basic MyGovID account, you should:

  1. Visit [ MyGovID.ie ](https://www.mygovid.ie/en-IE/HowDoISignUp)
  2. Enter your email address, create a password and click ‘Register now’ 
  3. A code will be sent to your email address, which you must enter on-screen to complete your basic account registration. 

Once you have activated your MyGovID account, you can log into your basic
account. You will see a list of online services, including MyWelfare services.

You can also log directly into MyWelfare using your MyGovID.

##  Setting up a verified MyGovID account

A [ verified MyGovID account ](https://www.mygovid.ie/en-IE/HowDoISignUp) is
more secure than a basic account. It lets you access all available services.

You can upgrade from a basic account to a verified MyGovID account at [
MyGovID.ie ](https://www.mygovid.ie/) or you can download the [ MyGovID app
](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/f61b1-mygovid-app/) onto your smartphone.

To upgrade from a basic account to a verified MyGovID, you need:

  * A [ Personal Public Service (PPS) number ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/personal-public-service-number/)
  * A [ Public Services Card (PSC) ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/public-services-card/) , and 
  * A verified mobile phone that can receive text messages. If your phone is not yet verified by the Department of Social Protection, you can call them on 0818 927 999. 

If you do not have a PSC, you can apply:

  * Using the [ MyGovID app ](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/f61b1-mygovid-app/)
  * [ In-person ](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/fd52ab-public-services-card/#your-safe-registration-appointment) at a [ PSC Centre ](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/be29c7-psc-online-registration-centres/)

If you do not have a PPS number, you will need to apply for your PPS number at
a designated [ PPS Number Allocation Centre
](http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/Personal-Public-Service-Number-Registration-
Centres-by-Count.aspx) .

Every time you access your verified MyGovID account, you will be asked to
enter a verification code which has been sent to your mobile phone. This
2-step authentication process makes your account more secure.

Once you have a verified account, you can apply for social welfare payments
online. In some cases, you must be invited by the Department of Social
Protection to apply online.

##  More information about online social welfare services

###  **I don’t have access to the Internet**

If you don’t have internet access, you can continue to apply for social
welfare payments as normal. MyWelfare is just another way to access services,
apply for benefits, or amend your jobseeker’s details.
