##  Introduction

When you pass a [ driving test ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/travel-
and-recreation/motoring/driving-tests/driving-test/) , you can apply for a
driving licence. You can apply to renew your licence online or in person by
appointment at an NDLS office.

The Road Safety Authority has responsibility for driver licensing. The
National Driver Licence Service (NDLS) manages licence applications and
renewals.

This page explains how to apply for your driving licence after you have passed
a driving test.

##  Rules

You can apply for a driving licence if you have passed the driving test for
that category of vehicle in the last 2 years. If your Certificate of
Competency (the document that proves that you passed the driving test) is over
2 years old, you will have to take the driving test again.

You must bring your driving licence with you when driving.

###  **What is normal residence?**

To apply for a driving licence, you must be normally resident in Ireland. You
are normally resident if you usually live here for at least 185 days in each
calendar year.

Asylum seekers can use their temporary residence certificates as proof of
normal residence in Ireland when applying for a driving licence or learner
permit.

###  **Categories of vehicles**

Motor vehicles are divided into different categories for driver licensing
purposes. When you pass a driving test, you apply for a driving licence for a
particular category of vehicle. Your type of driving licence may allow you to
drive certain other types of vehicles. You can read more in our page on [
categories of vehicles and minimum ages of drivers
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/travel-and-recreation/motoring/driver-
licensing/categories-of-motor-vehicles-and-minimum-age-of-drivers-in-ireland/)
.

####

##  How to apply for a driving licence

There are 2 ways that you can apply for your driving licence.

  1. Online at [ NDLS.ie ](https://www.ndls.ie/index.php) , or 
  2. In person by [ booking an appointment ](https://www.ndls.ie/booking-service.html) at an [ NDLS centre ](https://www.ndls.ie/how-to-apply/applying-in-person.html#centre-locations) . 

###  **Apply online**

To apply for your driving licence online, you will need:

  * A [ Public Services Card ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/public-services-card/) * and verified [ MyGovID ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/government-in-ireland/how-government-works/egovernment/mygovid/)
  * [ Proof of your address ](https://www.ndls.ie/how-to-apply/applying-in-person.html#evidence-of-address) if your address is different to the one you provided when you got your Public Services Card 
  * Proof that you are normally resident in Ireland if you are not an EU or EEA citizen 
  * A medical report form, dated within one month [ if required ](https://www.ndls.ie/medical-fitness/do-i-need-to-submit-a-medical-report.html)
  * Application fee of €55 (unless you are 70 or over) 
  * [ Certificate of Professional Competence (CPC) ](https://www.rsa.ie/services/professional-drivers/cpc) for professional drivers 

*If your PSC photo is over 10 years old, you must renew it on [ MyWelfare ](https://services.mywelfare.ie/) first using a verified MyGovID. Then apply online at [ ndls.ie ](https://www.ndls.ie/index.php) for your driving licence. 

If you apply online, you do not have to provide your Certificate of Competence
(the document that proves that you passed the driving test).

Read more about the [ online application process on the NDLS website
](https://www.ndls.ie/how-to-apply/applying-online.html) .

###  **Apply in person**

You can apply for your driving licence in person by [ booking an appointment
](https://www.ndls.ie/booking-service.html) at one of [ 34 NDLS centres
nationwide ](https://www.ndls.ie/how-to-apply/applying-in-person.html#centre-
locations) . There is no walk-in service available.

You will need to bring:

  * Appropriate [ Identification ](https://www.ndls.ie/how-to-apply/applying-in-person.html#photo-id) , 
  * Supporting documentation, and 
  * The [ fee ](https://www.ndls.ie/how-to-apply/fees.html) (see ‘Rates’ above) 

Unless you want to [ make your application in Irish ](https://www.ndls.ie/how-
to-apply/forms-reports.html) , you are no longer required to submit an
application form. However, you do need to prove your identity. Your photograph
and signature will be captured at the NDLS centre.

###  **Identification**

In most cases, a [ Public Service Card (PSC)
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-
system/public-services-card/) is used to verify your details to process your
application.

If you don’t have a PSC, you will need to submit the following 4 pieces of
documentary evidence:

  1. Photo ID 
  2. Evidence of your address 
  3. Evidence of your PPS number 
  4. Evidence of your normal residence 

You can read more about the types of documents the NDLS will accept as
evidence regarding each of these criteria [ in their guidance notes (pdf)
](https://www.ndls.ie/images/Documents/Forms/170552_NDLS_FULL_LICENCE_GUIDE_NOTES_JUNE_2021_WEB_HR_-
_Front_Office.pdf) .

###  **Supporting documentation**

Additionally, to support your application, you will have to submit your:

  * Current or most recently issued learner permit, or 
  * Current driving licence, if you are adding a category to your driving licence or applying to exchange a foreign licence 

Depending on the nature of your application, you may also need a:

  * Driving Licence Medical Report Form (see below) 
  * Driving Licence Eyesight Report Form (see below) 
  * Completed [ Certificate of Professional Competence (CPC) ](https://www.rsa.ie/RSA/Professional-Drivers/Driver-Hours/) (for professional drivers)

  * Completed [ Garda Declaration form ](https://www.ndls.ie/images/Documents/170552_RSA_NDLS_Garda_Declaration_Form_Final_for_FO_2021.pdf) (when applying to replace a lost, stolen or damaged licence) 
  * Evidence of new address (if your address has changed since your last application) 

###  **Medical report form**

You will need a Driving Licence Medical Report Form if you apply for driving
licence categories C, C1, D, D1, CE, C1E, DE or D1E (buses and trucks), unless
you previously provided a medical report which is still applicable.

You will not need a Driving Licence Medical Report Form if you are applying
for driving licence categories AM, A1, A2, A, B, BE or W (motorcycles, cars
and work vehicles) unless you have a [ specific disability or condition
](https://www.ndls.ie/medical-reports.html#specified-diseases-and-
disabilities-which-need-to-be-reported-on-application-for-or-renewal-of-a-
driver-licence) .

If you are aged 75 or over, you will need a certification of fitness to drive
from your doctor to apply for a 3-year or a one-year licence. You can read the
[ medical fitness to drive guidelines (pdf)
](https://www.ndls.ie/images/PDF_Documents/NDLS_Sla%CC%81inte_&_Tioma%CC%81int_2022_WEB.pdf)
.

You can [ download the medical report form (pdf)
](https://www.ndls.ie/images/Documents/Forms/170735_NDLS_Medical_Form_JUNE_2021_GH_WEB_HR.pdf)
(it must be printed back to back on one page). It is also available from NDLS
centres. A registered medical practitioner should complete your medical
examination and then complete the form. You must sign the declaration on the
medical report form in the presence of the registered medical practitioner.
You must send it within 1 month of the medical examination.

###  **Eyesight report form**

Generally, your medical practitioner will report any eyesight issues in the
Driving Licence Medical Report Form.

But you will need a Driving Licence Eyesight Report Form if you no longer need
glasses or contact lenses to drive (for example if you've had laser eye
surgery).

You can [ download the eyesight report form (pdf)
](http://www.ndls.ie/images/Documents/DrivingLicence/155076_NDLS_Eyesight_Rep_V9_Online_FA_BD_PDFX.pdf)
