##  What is the Back to School Clothing and Footwear Allowance?

The Back to School Clothing and Footwear Allowance (BSCFA) is a payment to
help families with the cost of school uniforms and shoes.

Many families get the BSCFA automatically. If you are paid automatically, you
don't need to apply for the BSCFA.

Automatic BSCFA payments were paid the week starting 8 July 2024.

If you don’t get an automatic payment, you can apply for the payment online at
MyWelfare (see ‘how to apply’ below).

Applications for the Back to School Clothing and Footwear Allowance opened on
**12 June 2024** and will close on **30 September 2024** .

##  Can I get the Back to School Clothing and Footwear Allowance?

You can get the Back to School Clothing and Footwear Allowance (BSCFA) if you
have a child that qualifies, and:

  * You are getting a qualifying social welfare payment, or are participating in an approved employment, education or training support scheme. See [ a list of qualifying payments and schemes ](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/86a6ba-operational-guidelines-back-to-school-clothing-and-footwear-scheme/#annex-a) on Gov.ie 
  * Your household is within the BSCFA income limits (see ‘Income limits’ below) 
  * You and each child you claim the BSCFA for are resident in Ireland. 

If you are getting a social welfare payment, you must be getting an [ Increase
for a Qualified Child (IQC) ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-
welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/claiming-a-social-welfare-
payment/claiming-and-increase-in-your-payment-for-a-child-dependant/) with
your payment. There are some exceptions to this (see ‘I don’t get an IQC’
below).

####  **I don’t get an IQC with my social welfare payment**

If you are getting a qualifying social welfare payment but you don’t get an
IQC, you can still claim BSCFA if:

  * The rules of your payment do not provide for a child payment (for example, [ Maternity Benefit ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/families-and-children/maternity-benefit/) and [ Adoptive Benefit ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/families-and-children/adoptive-benefit/) ), or 
  * Your spouse or partner's income is over the specified limit for your payment, but your overall household income is within the BSCFA income limits (see ‘Income limits’ below). 

You must meet the other rules for getting BSCFA.

###  **Does my child qualify?**

To get the BSCFA, your child must be:

  * Aged between 4-17 on 30 September in the year you apply 
  * Aged between 18-22 and returning to full-time second-level education in a recognised school or college in the autumn of the year you apply 

Your child must be resident in Ireland.

####  **Foster children**

[ Foster children ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/birth-family-
relationships/adoption-and-fostering/fostering/) do not qualify for the BSCFA.
This is because foster parents get a [ Foster Care Allowance
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/birth-family-relationships/adoption-
and-fostering/fostering/#60a83b) , which includes help with the cost of
clothing and footwear for the child.

##  Income limits for the Back to School Clothing and Footwear Allowance

Your **total household income** must be less than the amounts set out in the
table below.

The Department of Social Protection (DSP) counts all your dependent children
when applying the income limit, including:

  * Your children who are aged under 4 
  * Your children aged 18 to 22 who are in third level education. 

###  **Calculating your total household income**

Your total household income includes:

  * Your weekly social welfare or Health Service Executive (HSE) payments, and 
  * Any other income you may have, including wages 
  * Capital (such as savings, investments, and any property you have excluding your own home) 

However, some social welfare payments are not included in the means test (see
list below).

When assessing your income from wages, the DSP looks at your income **before**
tax. However, they don’t include PRSI and a standard travel allowance of up to
€20 per week.

###  **Payments not included in the means test for BSCFA**

Your income from the following payments is not counted in the means test for
BSCFA:

  * [ Child Benefit ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/families-and-children/child-benefit/)

The Department of Social Protection (DSP) will assess your capital in the
means test. This includes your:

  * Savings 
  * Investments 
  * Shares 
  * Property (but not your own home). When assessing a second property, DSP uses the capital value minus any outstanding mortgage. 

Your capital is assessed as weekly means using the following rules:

First €5,000  |  Not taken into account

##  How to apply for the Back to School Clothing and Footwear Allowance

###  **I get the BSCFA automatically**

You don't need to apply for the Back to School Clothing and Footwear Allowance
(BSCFA) if you get the payment automatically.

The Department of Social Protection (DSP) will let you know if you are paid
automatically using your [ MyWelfare
](https://services.mywelfare.ie/en/topics/parents-children-family/) account,
or by post.

If you don’t hear from the DSP by the end of June, you must apply for BSCFA
online, even if you got the BSCFA payment last year. See ‘I don’t get the
BSCFA automatically’ below.

###  **I don’t get the BSCFA automatically**

If you don’t get the payment automatically, you can apply for the Back to
School Clothing and Footwear Allowance online at [ MyWelfare.ie
](https://services.mywelfare.ie/en/topics/parents-children-family/) . You will
need [ a verified MyGovID account
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/government-in-ireland/how-government-
works/egovernment/mygovid/) .

If you don’t have a verified MyGovID account, you can call the BSCFA contact
centre on (071) 919 3318 or 0818 11 11 13, and they will help you to set one
up. They can also post you a paper copy of the application form.

Or, you can [ download and print a paper application form for the BSCFA (pdf)
](https://www.gov.ie/pdf/?file=https://assets.gov.ie/34358/0c27ef99d2944f39bbb926e5ecfffe2c.pdf#page=null)
.

Applications for BSCFA opened on **12 June 2024,** and will close on **30
September 2024** .

You should apply for the BSCFA before the closing date if:

  * You have applied for a social welfare payment and are waiting for a decision on your application, or 
  * You have appealed a decision not to award you a social welfare payment 

Your BSCFA application will be decided when you get a decision on your social
welfare payment application, or on your appeal.

###  **Appealing a BSCFA decision**

If you are unhappy with the decision on your BSCFA application, you should
send a letter to the Back to School Clothing and Footwear Allowance Review
Section (see contact details under ‘More information’ below).

In your letter, you should:

  * Explain the reasons why you think the decision was incorrect 
  * Ask that your application be reviewed. 

You should ask for a review within 21 days of getting your decision.

You can’t appeal a BSCFA decision to the Social Welfare Appeals Office.
