##  Getting qualified

To become a bus or truck driver in Ireland, you need to:

  * Have a full car licence (category B car or light van) 
  * Be over 18 for the truck (category C) 
  * Be over 21 for the bus (category D) 
  * Be medically fit 
  * Be normally resident in Ireland to apply for a learner permit or driving licence 
  * Get a professional driving qualification called the Driver Certificate of Professional Competence (CPC) 

You must have the Driver CPC if you drive professionally, and it’s your job.

To become a bus or truck driver, you must pass a:

  * Theory test 
  * Case study test 
  * Practical driving test 
  * Walkaround test 

###  Professional driver obligations under EU law

Under European law, people who drive for a living must have regular training.
This is to make sure they have a high standard of safety and driving. The RSA
introduced the Driver CPC. Since September 2014, all professional truck and
bus drivers must carry a Driver CPC. You must also have a full driving licence
in the category of vehicle that you are driving.

##  Returning to be a bus or truck driver

If you previously qualified as a bus or truck driver, you may have what is
known as [ acquired rights ](https://www.rsa.ie/services/professional-
drivers/cpc/cpc-for-established-drivers) . This is where you got your bus or
truck driving licence before Driver CPC was introduced.

This means that you don’t have to sit any exams. However, you must complete [
Driver CPC periodic training ](https://www.rsa.ie/services/professional-
drivers/cpc/periodic-training-and-compliance) to keep your Driver CPC
qualification.

**If you are a bus driver** who **** got your bus licence before 10 September
2008, you have acquired rights to Driver CPC.

**If you are a truck driver** who got your truck licence before 10 September
2009, you have acquired rights to Driver CPC.

There are some other circumstances that you may qualify for a Driver CPC card.
See the [ RSA website ](https://www.rsa.ie/services/professional-
drivers/cpc/cpc-for-established-
drivers#:~:text=Acquired%20rights,Driver%20CPC%20card.) for more information
about this.

**If you are a foreign driver and want to drive professionally in Ireland**

There are certain rules if you are a driver from another EU country or if you
are from outside of the EU.

**If you hold a valid Driver CPC from another EU country**

You can drive professionally in Ireland until your EU driving licence or CPC
qualification expires. When it expires, you'll need to renew both in Ireland.
To renew your Driver CPC, complete the required training modules in Ireland.

**If your licence is from a country with an exchange agreement (this includes
Australia, Japan, South Africa or South Korea)**

You must [ follow specific guidelines
](https://www.rsa.ie/services/professional-drivers/cpc/foreign-cpc-
drivers#:~:text=Outside%20the%20EU,tachograph%20rules.) provided for
professional driving in Ireland.

**If you are from outside the EU but there is no licence agreement**

You must go through all the steps to get an Irish Licence and the CPC.

You can get more information on the [ RSA website
](https://www.rsa.ie/services/professional-drivers/cpc/foreign-cpc-drivers) .

##  Step 1: Pass the theory test

If you are a new bus or truck driver, you must complete a [ theory test
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/travel-and-
recreation/motoring/driving-tests/driver-theory-test/#f41842) . The test is
computer based and the format of the test is multiple choice questions. You
should [ prepare for the theory test ](https://theorytest.ie/revision-
material/) . Study the [ Rules of the Road
](https://www.rsa.ie/services/learner-drivers/resources/rules-of-the-road) and
the [ Safe Driving for Work Handbook ](https://drivingforwork.ie/wp-
content/uploads/2017/10/Safe_Driving_for_Work_Handbook_.pdf) .

You can take the test at any [ theory test centre (pdf)
](https://theorytest.ie/wp-content/uploads/theory-test-ireland-test-centre-
location-map-051017.pdf) nationwide. You can [ apply and pay for your driver
theory test online ](http://www.theorytest.ie/driver-theory-test/schedule-
test/) . The test costs €72. Make sure you bring [ valid identification
](https://theorytest.ie/general-information/id-requirements/) on the day of
your theory test.

##  Step 2: Pass the case study test

After you pass the driver theory test, you can take the [ case study test
](https://www.rsa.ie/services/professional-drivers/cpc/become-a-professional-
cpc-driver/3.-case-study-test) . You will be asked 15 questions on each of 3
real-life driver situations. You can [ book, reschedule or cancel a CPC theory
(case study) test online ](https://theorytest.ie/book-your-theory-test/cpc-
driver-certificate-of-professional-competence/) .

You can take the test online in any of the [ theory test centres (pdf)
](https://theorytest.ie/wp-content/uploads/theory-test-ireland-test-centre-
location-map-051017.pdf) nationwide. You can see the [ fees
](https://theorytest.ie/book-your-theory-test/cpc-driver-certificate-of-
professional-competence/#:~:text=What%20are%20the,Module%20Test%20\(TMT\)) on
the theory test website. The cost for a bus or truck test is €72.

##  Step 3: Get a learner permit

You must hold a learner permit appropriate to the category of bus or truck you
want to drive. When you apply, you’ll need to choose the [ category of Learner
permit ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/travel-and-
recreation/motoring/driver-licensing/categories-of-motor-vehicles-and-minimum-
age-of-drivers-in-ireland/#096417) you’re applying for.

Find out [ how to apply for a learner permit
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/travel-and-recreation/motoring/driver-
licensing/learner-driving-permits-for-cars-and-work-vehicles/#97368a) .

##  Step 4: Practise driving

Before taking a test, you should take lessons. The more prepared you are the
better your chances of passing the driving test are. You should complete
lessons with an [ RSA Approved Driving Instructor (ADI)
](https://www.rsa.ie/services/learner-drivers/driving-lessons/find-an-
instructor/approved-driving-instructor) . However, you are not required to
take [ truck or bus driving lessons ](https://www.rsa.ie/services/learner-
drivers/driving-lessons/professional-driving-lessons-\(cpc\)) to get a CPC
driving licence.

##  Step 5: Pass the driving test

You must complete a driving test to get a truck or bus driving licence. The [
Road Safety Authority (RSA) ](https://www.rsa.ie/) carries out driver testing
in Ireland. The fee for the test is €120.

##  Step 6: Pass the walk around test

The [ walkaround test ](https://www.rsa.ie/services/professional-
drivers/cpc/become-a-professional-cpc-driver/7.-walkaround-test) checks your
ability to keep your vehicle safe and secure. It takes about 30 minutes. You
should prepare in advance for this test. You can book the walkaround test for
the same time as your driving test. The fee is €32.

You can book your walkaround test online. Sign up or log into the customer
portal [ MyRoadSafety.ie ](https://www.rsa.ie/services/myroadsafety-portal) .
Check with your chosen test centre beforehand to see if they provide a test in
the category you need.

##  Step 7: Apply for your driving licence

You can [ apply online ](https://www.ndls.ie/index.php) or in person for a
driving licence when you pass a [ driving test
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/travel-and-
recreation/motoring/driving-tests/driving-test/) . The cost of a new licence
is €55, or €35 if you’re adding the new category to your category B licence.

Find out in our page about [ applying for a driving licence
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/travel-and-recreation/motoring/driver-
licensing/full-driving-licence/) :

  * [ How to apply ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/travel-and-recreation/motoring/driver-licensing/full-driving-licence/#c76aec)
  * [ How long is a driving licence valid? ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/travel-and-recreation/motoring/driver-licensing/full-driving-licence/#894665)
  * [ How much does a driving licence cost? ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/travel-and-recreation/motoring/driver-licensing/full-driving-licence/#f05909)
  * [ What are the restrictions on novice drivers? ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/travel-and-recreation/motoring/driver-licensing/full-driving-licence/#43f97f)

##  Step 8: Apply for your first Driver CPC card

You should [ add the bus or truck category to your driving licence
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/travel-and-recreation/motoring/driver-
licensing/how-do-i-add-a-category-to-my-irish-driving-licence/) first.
Otherwise, your application for your [ CPC card
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/travel-and-recreation/motoring/driver-
licensing/learner-driving-permits-for-cars-and-work-vehicles/#7f5f86) may be
rejected.

[ Download a Driver CPC application form (pdf)
](https://www.rsa.ie/docs/default-source/services/s3.1-cpc/cpc-driver-
qualification-declaration-form.pdf?Status=Master&sfvrsn=8595d21c_13/CPC-
Driver-Qualification-Declaration-form.pdf) , complete it and post it. There is
no fee. You should get a card within 20 working days.

You can only drive professionally when you get this card. There are [ some
limited exceptions ](https://www.rsa.ie/services/professional-
drivers/cpc/what-is-
cpc#:~:text=Who%20doesn%27t%20need,driver%E2%80%99s%20main%20activity.) . For
example, you do not need a Driver CPC card for:

  * Vehicles that carry materials or equipment used by you as part of your work, provided driving isn’t your main activity. 
  * Drivers of vehicles for non-commercial purposes, such as unpaid volunteers or emergency or rescue vehicle drivers. 

See the RSA website for a [ full list of exceptions
](https://www.rsa.ie/services/professional-drivers/cpc/what-is-
cpc#:~:text=Who%20doesn%27t%20need,driver%E2%80%99s%20main%20activity.) .

[ Strict penalties ](https://www.rsa.ie/services/professional-
drivers/cpc/regulations-for-driver-cpc) apply if you drive without a Driver
CPC. The law is enforced by An Garda Síochána and Road Safety Authority
Transport Officers.

To remain CPC certified, [ you must maintain your CPC
](https://www.rsa.ie/services/professional-drivers/cpc/become-a-professional-
cpc-driver/10.-staying-qualified) over 5 years. The [ RSA website
](https://www.rsa.ie/services/professional-drivers/cpc/become-a-professional-
cpc-driver/9.-driver-cpc-card) has more information about the CPC card.

##  Step 9: Keep up training for your Driver CPC card

You must update your Driver CPC qualification every 5 years. This is called [
periodic training ](https://www.rsa.ie/services/professional-
drivers/cpc/periodic-training-and-compliance) . You must attend one module per
year with an approved CPC training organisation. For the [ dual CPC
qualification ](https://www.rsa.ie/services/professional-drivers/cpc/periodic-
training-and-compliance#:~:text=The%20CPC%20training,account.) (both bus and
truck), there are 6 training modules over 5 years. In both cases, training
must be for one day and a minimum of 7 hours per day.

The training covers:

  * Road safety 
  * Environmental driving 
  * Driver health well-being 

It does not involve a driving test or assessment.

More information is available on the [ National Driver Licence Service (NDLS)
