##  Introduction

There are 3 debt resolution procedures to help mortgage-holders and other
people with unsustainable debt to reach agreements with their creditors. These
procedures offer different solutions to people in different situations. Each
option has its own rules and procedures.

One important issue is whether your debts are secured or not. _Secured_ _debt_
means debt backed by an asset, for example, a mortgage. _Unsecured debt_
includes debts on credit cards, loans and overdrafts.

The 3 debt resolution procedures are:

  * A Debt Relief Notice (DRN) to allow for the write-off of debt (generally unsecured and in some cases secured) up to €35,000, with a 3-year supervision period 
  * A Debt Settlement Arrangement (DSA) for the agreed settlement of unsecured debt, with no limit involved, normally over a period of 5 years 
  * A Personal Insolvency Arrangement (PIA) for the agreed settlement of secured debt up to €3 million (though this cap can be increased) and unsecured debt, with no limit involved, normally over a period of up to 6 years 

These procedures were introduced by the [ Personal Insolvency Act 2012
](http://revisedacts.lawreform.ie/eli/2012/act/44/revised/en/html) and are
described in more detail below.

If you have tried to solve your debt problems with these procedures but they
are not suitable you can apply for bankruptcy. Bankruptcy is a formal High
Court process for people with debt over €20,000.

##  General rules

Each of the 3 debt resolution procedures has its own rules and procedures but
the following main rules apply to all of them.

###  Limits on usage

You can be involved in only one of the 3 procedures (DRN, DSA or PIA) or in
the bankruptcy process at any one time. If you use one of these 4 processes,
you will generally have to wait some years before applying to use another.

You may use each of the 3 procedures only once in your lifetime. (There is no
such limit on bankruptcy but it would be rare for anyone to go bankrupt
twice.)

###  Running up debts

You must not deliberately stop paying (or underpay) your creditors while these
procedures are being set up as this may cause your application to be
ineligible.

###  Provision of information

You will have to complete a Prescribed Financial Statement, giving full and
honest information about your financial circumstances. The required
information for the statement is set out in the [ Personal Insolvency Act 2012
(Prescribed Financial Statement) Regulations 2014
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2014/si/259/) . You must sign a
declaration that you are acting in good faith and co-operate fully with the
process.

You will have to give your written consent that certain personal data held by
banks and other financial institutions can be accessed so that your financial
situation can be verified. Government departments and agencies will have the
power to release certain information about you.

###  Public registers

If you use any of these 3 procedures, your name and details will be published
on a register, which is available to the public on [ the ISI website
](http://www.isi.gov.ie/) . The success or failure of the process will also be
recorded.

##  Debt Relief Notice

The Debt Relief Notice (DRN) process provides debt relief for people who have
virtually no disposable income or assets and no prospect of being able to pay
off the debt in the next 3 years. If a DRN is issued for you, it will allow
for the write-off of your qualifying debt up to €35,000 subject to a 3-year
supervision period.

During this period your creditors will not be able to pursue you for payment,
but if your circumstances improve during the 3 years, you may have to pay part
of your debts accordingly. At the end of the 3 years, all of the debts covered
by the DRN will be written off, even if you have not managed to pay anything
off them.

###  How do you get a DRN?

Your application must be made through an Approved Intermediary (AI) – see [
How to apply ](/en/money-and-tax/personal-finance/debt/personal-
insolvency/personal-insolvency-options#ld1a9a) below. This is someone who is
authorised by the ISI to assist you with your application.

Read more about [ Debt Relief Notices (DRNs) ](/en/money-and-tax/personal-
finance/debt/personal-insolvency/debt-relief-notices/) .

##  Debt Settlement Arrangement

A Debt Settlement Arrangement (DSA) provides for the agreed settlement of
unsecured debt with one or more creditors over a period of 5 years, with a
possible agreed extension to 6 years.

You may apply for a DSA if the levels of your income, assets and debts mean
that you are not eligible for a Debt Relief Notice. You must be able to make
some repayments to your creditors in return for a discount of your debts. The
DSA is a voluntary arrangement and it will have to get the support of
creditors representing at least 65% of your total debt.

You must apply through a Personal Insolvency Practitioner (PIP). This is a
professional who is approved and registered by the Insolvency Service of
Ireland to operate DSAs and Personal Insolvency Arrangements – see [ How to
apply ](/en/money-and-tax/personal-finance/debt/personal-insolvency/personal-
insolvency-options#ld1a9a) below.

When the agreed period ends, and if your DSA has operated successfully, you
will be discharged from the debts that it covered. This means that the debts
will be written off.

tax/personal-finance/debt/personal-insolvency/debt-settlement-arrangements/) .

##  Personal Insolvency Arrangement

A Personal Insolvency Arrangement (PIA) provides for the agreed settlement of
secured debt up to a limit of €3 million (although this limit may be increased
with the agreement of all secured creditors) and an unlimited amount of
unsecured debt. A PIA will run over a period of up to 6 years, with a possible
agreed extension to 7 years.

The PIA works like a Debt Settlement Arrangement in the following ways:

  * You must apply through a Personal Insolvency Practitioner (PIP) – see [ How to apply ](personal_insolvency_options.en.html#ld1a9a) below 
  * You must be able to make some repayments to your creditors in return for a discount of your debts 
  * It is a voluntary arrangement and must get the support of creditors – both secured and unsecured – representing at least 65% of your total debt 

In addition, over 50% of your secured creditors and 50% of unsecured creditors
must vote in favour. However, if a mortgage lender rejects the personal
insolvency proposal you can apply for a court review of the rejection.

Abhaile, an [ aid and advice scheme ](/en/housing/owning-a-home/mortgage-
arrears/abhaile-mortgage-arrears-support/) for people in serious mortgage
arrears provides for free legal representation for eligible borrowers in
seeking such a review.

When the agreed period ends, and if your PIA has operated successfully, you
will be discharged from the unsecured debts that it covered but the secured
debt will only be discharged to the extent specified in the PIA.

tax/personal-finance/debt/personal-insolvency/personal-insolvency-
arrangements/) .
