##  Checklist for people with disabilities and long-term illness

The lists and links below are to help you to check out all the main services
and entitlements for people with disabilities. The focus is on adults with a
long-term illness or disability likely to last at least one year.

The headings in the left hand column of each section link to general documents
on the subject, and those in the right hand column link to details of specific
payments or services.

The [ National Advocacy Service for People with Disabilities (NAS)
](http://www.citizensinformationboard.ie/services/advocacy_services/) provides
independent, confidential and free advocacy for people with disabilities - in
particular people who are isolated from their community and services, have
communication differences, are inappropriately accommodated, live in
residential services or attend day services and have limited supports. Visit

service and how to use it.
