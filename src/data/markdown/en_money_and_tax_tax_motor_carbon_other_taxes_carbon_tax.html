#  Carbon tax

  * Introduction 
  * Rates 
  * Further information 

##  Introduction

There is a carbon tax on fuel supplied in Ireland. The tax is based on the
amount of carbon dioxide that the fuel emits when it is used.

The **Solid Fuel Carbon Tax** applies to coal and peat.

The **Natural Gas Carbon Tax** applies to natural gas supplied to consumers.

Natural gas supplied as fuel in a motor vehicle is called 'vehicle gas' and is
instead liable to **Mineral Oil Tax** , part of which is a carbon charge.

The **Mineral Oil Tax Carbon Charge** also applies to petrol, auto-diesel and
marked gas oil. You can see [ how much of the Mineral Oil Tax on fuel is
carbon tax ](https://www.revenue.ie/en/companies-and-charities/excise-and-
licences/excise-duty-rates/mineral-oil-tax.aspx) .

##  Rates

The current rate of carbon tax is €56 per tonne of carbon dioxide emitted.

Carbon tax is paid by the supplier of the fuel.
