#  Death Benefits under the Occupational Injuries Scheme

  * Introduction 
  * Rules 
  * Rates 
  * How to apply 
  * Where to apply 

##  Introduction

If a person dies because of an accident at work or occupational disease, Death
Benefit (under the [ Occupational Injuries Scheme ](/en/social-
welfare/disability-and-illness/occupational-injuries-benefit-overview/) ) may
be paid to their surviving spouse or civil partner or dependent child. Death
Benefit may also be paid if, at the time of their death, the person was
getting a [ Disablement Pension ](/en/social-welfare/disability-and-
illness/disablement-benefit/) assessed at 50% or more, regardless of the cause
of death.

The Death Benefit Scheme includes:

  * Widow's, Widower's or Surviving Civil Partner's Pension 
  * Orphan's Pension 
  * Funeral Grant 

##  Rules

###  Widow's, Widower's or Surviving Civil Partner's Pension

This is paid to the surviving spouse or civil partner of a person who died as
a result of an accident at work, an occupational disease or who was getting a
Disablement Pension assessed as 50% or more at the time of their death. You
cannot get the pension if you remarry, enter into a civil partnership or
cohabit with another person. The pension is not affected by any income you may
have. Increases for qualified children are paid with the pension. [ The
pension is taxable ](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/claiming-
a-social-welfare-payment/taxation-of-social-welfare-payments/) .

A Widow's Widower's or Surviving Civil Partner's Pension under the Death
Benefit Scheme cannot be paid at the same time as a [ Widow's, Widower's or
Surviving Civil Partner's Contributory Pension ](/en/social-welfare/death-
related-benefits/widowed-persons-contrib-pension/) .

###  Orphan's Pension

This is paid on behalf of a child if the parent, step-parent or person who
supported the child died as a result of an accident at work, an occupational
disease or was getting a Disablement Pension assessed as 50% or more at the
time of their death. The orphan's guardian should apply for the payment.

###  Funeral Grant

If the deceased person meets the conditions a [ special Funeral Grant
](/en/social-welfare/death-related-benefits/special-funeral-grant/) can be
paid to the person who pays for the funeral expenses. A Funeral Grant is not
taxable.

##  Rates

Payments under the Death Benefit Scheme are paid at higher rates than a
standard Widow's, Widower's or Surviving Civil Partner's Contributory Pension
or a Guardian's payment.

**Death Benefit Scheme rates 2024**

**Payment** |  **Rate** |  **Increase for a child dependant**  
---|---|---  
Widow, widower or surviving civil partner (under 66)  |  €262.50  |  Child under 12  €46 (full rate), €23 (half rate)  Child aged 12 or over  €54 (full rate), €27 (half rate)   
Widow, widower or surviving civil partner (over 66)  |  €281.70   
Widow, widower or surviving civil partner (over 80)  |  €291.70   
Orphan's Pension  |  €218.80  |  N/A   
[ Funeral Grant ](../../../../../../en/social-welfare/social-welfare-payments/death-related-benefits/special-funeral-grant/) (once-off lump sum)  |  €850  |  N/A   
  
##  How to apply

A claim for any of the payments under the Death Benefit Scheme should be made
within 3 months of the date of death, otherwise you may lose some benefit.
