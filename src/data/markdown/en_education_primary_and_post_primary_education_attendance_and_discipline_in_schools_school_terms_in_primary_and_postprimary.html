#  School terms in primary and post-primary school

  * When does the school year start and end? 
  * School holidays 
  * School year 2023-2024 
  * School year 2024-2025 
  * School year 2025-2026 

##  When does the school year start and end?

The dates for the start and the end of the school year are not the same for
all schools. Schools can decide when students start school in the autumn, and
when they finish school in the summer.

The school year normally starts in the week in which 1 September falls.

Post-primary schools usually close before the June public holiday (the first
Monday in June) due to the start of State exams in June. Primary schools
usually close in the last week of June.

All schools are closed for July and most (or all) of August.

##  School holidays

Every school year, primary and post-primary schools also close for:

  * Autumn mid-term break 
  * Christmas 
  * February mid-term break 
  * Easter 

These holidays are standardised. The [ dates are set by the Department of
Education ](https://www.gov.ie/en/circular/0a2b0-standardisation-of-the-
school-year-in-respect-of-primary-post-primary-schools-for-the-
years-202324-202425-and-202526/) . See dates for the 'School year 2023-2024'
below.

At the start of the school year, you will get a list of days that the school
will be closed during the year, including holidays and training days for
teachers. If there are other unexpected closures, the school will let you know
in advance.

###  Discretionary days

Every school must be open for a minimum number of days:

  * Primary schools - 183 days 
  * Post-primary schools - 167 days 

Schools can use any remaining days at their discretion to extend the summer
holiday period or to close on religious or other holidays.

However, schools cannot use the discretionary days to extend the Christmas,
Easter or mid-term breaks (unless a religious observance day(s) falls at that
time for schools of a particular denomination or faith). If a school does not
have enough discretionary days left for a religious holiday, it can choose not
to have classes on that day.

Some schools use their discretionary days to extend bank holiday weekends and
others extend the May bank holiday break to a full week. You should check with
your school for details of the school holidays and any other planned
closures..
