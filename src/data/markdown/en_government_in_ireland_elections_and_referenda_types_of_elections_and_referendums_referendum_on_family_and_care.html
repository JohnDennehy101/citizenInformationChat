##  What is a referendum?

A constitutional referendum allows Irish citizens to decide whether or not to
change the wording of the Irish Constitution. [ The Irish Constitution
(Bunreacht na hÉireann) ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/government-in-
ireland/irish-constitution-1/constitution-introduction/) is the legal document
that sets out how Ireland should be governed.

On Friday, 8 March 2024, Irish citizens were asked to decide if changes should
be made to Article 41 of the [ Irish Constitution ](/en/government-in-
ireland/irish-constitution-1/constitution-introduction/) \- see 'Referendum
results' below.

The proposed changes were also called the _Family Amendment_ and the _Care
Amendment_ – for more information see ‘What was I asked to decide on?’ below.

To [ vote in a referendum ](/en/government-in-ireland/elections-and-
referenda/voting/voting-in-a-referendum/) , you must be:

  * An Irish citizen 
  * Aged 18 years or over 
  * Ordinarily resident in Ireland 
  * On the Register of Electors 

##  What was I asked to decide on?

On 8 March 2024, two referendums were held to decide if changes should be made
to the [ Irish Constitution ](/en/government-in-ireland/irish-constitution-1/)
. The proposed changes were called:

  * The Family Amendment, and 
  * The Care Amendment 

###  The Family Amendment

The Family Amendment is the 39th Amendment and it concerns the concept of
family in the Constitution.

It was on a white coloured ballot paper.

It deals with Article 41.1.1°and Article 41.3.1° of the Constitution.

Read more about the [ proposed Family Amendment
](https://www.electoralcommission.ie/referendums/referendum-information/what-
are-you-being-asked-to-decide-on/#FamilyAmendment) .

###  The Care Amendment

The Care Amendment is the 40th Amendment and it proposed to delete an existing
part of the Constitution and insert new text about care provided by family
members.

It was on a green coloured ballot paper.

In this amendment there was one vote for two proposed changes. The proposal
involved deleting Article 41.2.1° and Article 41.2.2° and inserting a new
Article.
