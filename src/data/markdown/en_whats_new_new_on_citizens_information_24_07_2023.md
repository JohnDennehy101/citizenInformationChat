From 1 August 2023, the net household income limit to qualify for [ cost
rental housing ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/housing/renting-a-
home/cost-rental-housing/) will increase from €53,000 per year to €66,000 if
you are in Dublin and €59,000 for everywhere else in Ireland.

If your landlord is selling the property and you want to buy it, you may
qualify for the [ Tenant Home Purchase Scheme
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/housing/owning-a-home/help-with-
buying-a-home/first-home-scheme/#9ba7dc) . This is an extension of the First
Home Scheme but for second-hand homes.

The [ Housing Adaptation Grant for people with a disability
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/housing/housing-grants-and-
schemes/housing-adaptation-grant-for-people-with-disability/) now covers fixed
track hoists to help make your home more accessible. Other equipment covered
by the grant includes ramps, stair lifts, grab rails, extensions and
accessible bathroom facilities.

Since 18 July 2023, the maximum amount covered by the [ Repair and Leasing
Scheme ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/housing/housing-grants-and-
schemes/repair-and-leasing-scheme/) increased to €80,000 per house or
apartment, including VAT. The scheme aims to bring vacant properties that need
repair back into use for social housing.

The Mother and Baby Institutions Payment Scheme Act 2023 was signed on 11 July
2023, but [ the scheme is not yet open for applications
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/birth-family-relationships/adoption-
and-fostering/mother-and-baby-homes/#4fab8a) . The Government must sign a
number of commencement orders before the Act comes into effect.
