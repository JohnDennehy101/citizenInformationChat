#  Unclaimed life insurance policies

  * Introduction 
  * When is a life insurance policy unclaimed? 
  * What life insurance policies are covered? 
  * Insurance company responsibilities 
  * The Dormant Account Fund 
  * How to apply 

##  Introduction

A life insurance policy provides money for dependants if you die. You may need
life insurance if you have family or others who rely on you. If you are
thinking about taking out insurance, you can find [ information about the
different types of life insurance
](https://www.ccpc.ie/consumers/money/insurance/) on ccpc.ie.

Insurance companies must try to get in touch with policy owners they have lost
contact with.

If the insurance company cannot find the owners, they classify the policy as
unclaimed.

##  When is a life insurance policy unclaimed?

If you have a life insurance policy, it becomes unclaimed:

  * 15 years after your last communication to the insurance provider, unless the policy was for a specific length of time 
  * 5 years after the end of the term if the policy was for a specific length of time (or 5 years after you last contacted the insurance provider if that is later) 

You have the right to claim the money in your unclaimed life assurance policy
at any time.

##  What life insurance policies are covered?

The [ Unclaimed Life Assurance Policies Act 2003
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2003/act/2/enacted/en/html) applies to
insurance companies in Ireland and life assurance policies where the policy
holder has an address in Ireland. Policies not covered are those that form
part of the assets of:

  * Occupational pension schemes 
  * Group health insurance or disability benefit schemes 
  * Sponsored superannuation schemes 

##  Insurance company responsibilities

Insurance companies must:

  * Keep a register of unclaimed policies 
  * Contact customers whose life insurance policies are worth €500 or more and tell them how to claim for the policies 
  * Advertise in the national press each year to inform customers whose policies are worth less than €500 

##  The Dormant Account Fund

Unclaimed life assurance policies must be transferred to the [ Dormant
Accounts Fund ](/en/money-and-tax/personal-finance/banking/dormant-bank-
accounts-in-ireland/) in April of each year. This fund is managed by the [
National Treasury Management Agency ](http://www.ntma.ie/) (NTMA).

The insurance companies must calculate the cash value of unclaimed life
insurance policies on the date that they are transferred to the Dormant
Accounts Fund.

The NTMA invests Dormant Accounts Fund and distributes its earnings to
programmes or projects helping people with disabilities and people who are
disadvantaged economically, socially, or educationally. This distribution is
organised by the [ Dormant Accounts Disbursement Fund
](https://www.gov.ie/en/collection/8f02c3-dormant-accounts-disbursement-
scheme/) .

##  How to apply

Contact the policy provider. Insurance Ireland is the representative body for
the sector and it provides a [ directory of insurance providers
](https://www.insuranceireland.eu/about-us/a-z-directory-of-members) that
lists all its members.

Insurance Ireland provides an [ Unclaimed Insurance Policy Enquiry Form (docx)
](https://www.insuranceireland.eu/media/documents/UNCLAIMED%20LIFE%20ASSURANCE%20POLICIES%20ENQUIRY%20FORM.docx)
that you can use for an unclaimed policy that is in your name or in the name
of someone else. It provides information about [ what to do if you have an
unclaimed policy ](https://www.insuranceireland.eu/consumer-information/life-
and-pensions/savings-and-investments) .

If you cannot find the original insurance provider, contact Insurance Ireland.
It keeps a register of providers that have changed name or address, been taken
over, merged with another insurance company or closed down.
