#  Case study: Calculating your income tax

  * Introduction 
  * Tax credits 
  * Tax rates and the standard rate cut-off point 
  * Tax allowances 

##  Introduction

These examples demonstrate [ how your tax is calculated ](/en/money-and-
tax/tax/income-tax/how-your-tax-is-calculated/) in 2024 and how tax credits
reduce the amount of tax you have to pay.

##  Tax credits

Joan is single and earns €28,000 a year. She gets her [ tax credit certificate
](https://www.revenue.ie/en/jobs-and-pensions/calculating-your-income-tax/tax-
credit-certificate.aspx) from Revenue.

Joan’s tax credits are listed as:

  * Single Person Tax Credit = €1,875 
  * Employee (PAYE) Tax Credit = €1,875   
**Tax credit total** = €3,750

The standard rate cut-off point for a single person is €42,000. Because Joan’s
income is below the cut-off point, all of her income is taxed at the standard
rate, (20%), to give her gross tax.  
28,000 x 20% = €5,600 gross tax.

All her tax credits are deducted from the gross tax to give the **tax that is
payable** :  
€5,600 - €3,750 = €1,850

Joan is also liable to pay the [ Universal Social Charge ](/en/money-and-
tax/tax/income-tax/universal-social-charge/) (USC).

**USC** = €424.62. This is calculated as follows:

  * A rate of 0.5% on the first €12,012 (which comes to €60.06) 
  * 2% on the next €13,748 (which comes to €274.96) 
  * 4% on the balance of €2,240 (which comes to €89.60) 

The **total** amount deducted from her annual income is:

€1,850 (income tax) + €424.62 (USC) = **€2,274.62**

You can get the monthly amount of the total tax that should be deducted from
wages by dividing this annual figure by 12.

Or, you can get the weekly amount of the total tax that should be deducted
from wages by dividing the annual figure by 52.

##  Tax rates and the standard rate cut-off point

A single taxpayer who earns €43,200 a year will have their tax calculated as
follows:

The [ **standard rate band** ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/money-
and-tax/tax/income-tax/how-your-tax-is-calculated/#354b71) for a single
taxpayer is €42,000.

This means that the first €42,000 is taxed at the standard rate of tax, 20%,
and the remainder (€1,200) is taxed at the higher rate of tax, 40%.  
€42,000 x 20% = €8,400  
€1,200 x 40% = €480  
**Total gross tax** = €8,880

**Tax credits** are deducted from this amount to give the tax due. A single
PAYE (Pay As You Earn) taxpayer is entitled to

  * Single Person Tax Credit = €1,875 
  * Employee (PAYE) Tax Credit = €1,875   
**Total tax credits** = €3,750

In this example, the taxpayer is not entitled to any [ other tax credits
](/en/money-and-tax/tax/income-tax-credits-and-reliefs/) .

Subtract the total tax credits to get the **income tax due** :

**Gross tax** of €8,880

**Minus tax credits** of €3,750  
**Tax due** = €5,130

The [ Universal Social Charge ](/en/money-and-tax/tax/income-tax/universal-
social-charge/) (USC) is also payable on the gross income.

USC is calculated as follows:

  * A rate of 0.5% on the first €12,012 (which comes to €60.06) 
  * 2% on the next €13,748 (which comes to €274.96) 
  * 4% on the balance of €17,440 (which comes to €697.60) 

**USC** = €1,032.62

The **total amount deducted from income** in the year is:

€5,130 ( **income tax** ) **+** €1,032.62 ( **USC** ) = **€6,162.62**

##  Tax allowances

Tax allowances also reduce the amount of tax you have to pay. The amount a tax
allowance reduces your tax by depends on how much income tax you pay at the
highest rate of tax. This is because the allowance is subtracted from your
income before tax is calculated.

tax-is-calculated/#d43041) .
