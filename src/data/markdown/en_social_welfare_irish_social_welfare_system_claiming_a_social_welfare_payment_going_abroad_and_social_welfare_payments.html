#  Going abroad or on holidays and social welfare payments

  * Introduction 
  * Rules 
  * Further information 

##  Introduction

You can get certain Irish social welfare payments and live in another country.
You can also continue to get certain social welfare payments if you are on
holiday abroad for a specific period of time or if you are getting medical
treatment abroad.

Most [ social insurance payments ](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-
system/social-insurance-prsi/social-insurance/) can be paid to you outside of
this state, though the duration can depend on the payment and your
circumstances. However, to get a [ social assistance payment ](/en/social-
welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/social-assistance-payments/social-
assistance-in-ireland/) you must live in the State.

###  UK and social insurance payments

On [ 31 January 2020, the UK exited the EU
](https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2020/01/30/brexit-
council-adopts-decision-to-conclude-the-withdrawal-agreement/) . The [
Convention on Social Security between Ireland and the United Kingdom (pdf)
](http://opac.oireachtas.ie/AWData/Library3/EASPdoclaid07022019_095636.pdf)
maintains the recognition of, and access to, social insurance entitlements in
both jurisdictions. This means that the rights of Irish citizens living in
Ireland to benefit from social insurance contributions made when working in
the UK are protected and vice versa.

You can find a list of [ Irish social welfare payments covered by the
Convention ](https://www.gov.ie/en/press-release/c1896-social-protection-
measures-between-ireland-and-the-united-kingdom-are-maintained/) .

##  Rules

###  Holidays and social welfare payments

In general you can take up to 2 weeks holidays each year and have your social
welfare payment paid. However, you must always notify your local Intreo Centre
or Social Welfare Branch Office before you leave and to check your
entitlements. If you plan to take longer holidays or to be abroad for a longer
period your social welfare payment may not be paid.

###  Irish social welfare payments paid outside the State

If you are living outside the Irish State, the following social welfare
payments can be paid abroad:

  * [ Invalidity Pension ](/en/social-welfare/disability-and-illness/invalidity-pension/)
  * [ State Pension (Contributory) ](/en/social-welfare/older-and-retired-people/state-pension-contributory/)
  * [ Disablement Benefit ](/en/social-welfare/disability-and-illness/disablement-benefit/) . The Constant Attendance Allowance increase is only paid for up to 6 months. However, if you are abroad for medical treatment you may continue to get Incapacity Supplement, such claims are assessed on a case by case basis. 
  * [ Guardian's Payment (Contributory) ](/en/social-welfare/death-related-benefits/guardian-and-orphan-payments/)
  * [ Widow's, Widower's or Surviving Civil Partner's (Contributory) Pension ](/en/social-welfare/death-related-benefits/widowed-persons-contrib-pension/)
  * [ Death Benefits under the Occupational Injury Benefit Scheme ](/en/social-welfare/death-related-benefits/death-benefits-under-oib/)

Increases may also continue to be paid where it is the qualified [ adult or
child who is absent from the State
](https://www.gov.ie/ga/foilsiuchan/66826a-operational-guidelines-absence-
from-the-state/) . The normal conditions of dependency must continue to be
fulfilled.

If you are getting one of these social welfare payments and you are going
abroad for just a few weeks, you do _not_ have to notify the Department of
Social Protection.

If you are going abroad for a long period of time or moving abroad permanently
you must notify the Department. You will be asked to produce evidence to prove
that you continue to fulfil the qualifying conditions for the payment. For
example, you must not be married or in a new civil partnership or cohabitating
with someone to continue to get a Widow's, Widower's or Surviving Civil
Partner's Contributory Pension.

To get your social welfare benefit paid to you abroad, you must contact the
section in the Department of Social Protection that pays your payment and give
your bank account details so that they can transfer your payment directly into
a bank account while you are abroad. Where payment is already made into your
bank account in the State, you can continue to have it paid as it is or change
it to a financial institution outside the country.

You must always notify the Department of a permanent or temporary absence from
the State and give your contact address abroad.

###  Payments made abroad in limited situations

[ Injury Benefit ](/en/social-welfare/disability-and-illness/injury-benefit/)
can be paid abroad if you are getting approved medical treatment.

[ Illness Benefit ](/en/social-welfare/disability-and-illness/illness-
benefit/) can be paid for a maximum of 4 weeks while you are on holiday in a
country covered by EU Regulations and 3 weeks in other countries. You can
continue to get Illness Benefit if you go to live in another country covered
by EU Regulations. However, you must still meet all the qualifying criteria
for Illness Benefit which includes submitting medical certificates to the DSP.
If you go to live in another country covered by EU Regulations and become ill
you may apply for Illness Benefit from Ireland if you paid your last insurance
contribution in Ireland or you were getting Jobseeker’s Benefit in Ireland
before you went abroad. Illness Benefit is not paid in countries not covered
by EU Regulations. However, if you go to a country not covered by EU
regulations to get approved treatment your payment may resume when you return.

[ Carer's Benefit ](/en/social-welfare/carers/carers-benefit/) can be paid if
you accompany the person you are caring for abroad to get medical treatment.
You can also go abroad on a respite break for a maximum of 3 weeks. Carer's
Benefit may be paid if you are providing full-time care and attention to
another person in the EU, provided you meet the qualifying conditions for
Carer's Benefit.

[ Maternity Benefit ](/en/social-welfare/families-and-children/maternity-
benefit/) or [ Adoptive Benefit ](/en/social-welfare/families-and-
children/adoptive-benefit/) can continue to be paid to citizens of the [
EU/EEA, Switzerland ](/en/government-in-ireland/european-government/eu-
institutions/overview-of-eu-institutions/) or the UK for any period of their
maternity or adoptive leave spent in another EU/EEA country, Switzerland or
the UK.

Citizens of countries other than the EU/EEA , Switzerland or the UK can travel
anywhere abroad and get Maternity Benefit or Adoptive Benefit for a maximum of
6 weeks.

To get Maternity Benefit or Adoptive Benefit paid while abroad, you must
notify the Department in advance of travel.

[ Paternity Benefit ](/en/social-welfare/families-and-children/paternity-
benefit/) can be paid abroad to both EU and non-EU citizens for a maximum of 2
weeks. You must notify the Department in advance of travel.

If you are working in another [ EEA member state
](http://www.inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/Pages/eu-eea-countries) you may qualify for
benefit, if you continue to be insured under the Irish Social Welfare Acts.

[ Jobseeker's Benefit ](/en/social-welfare/unemployed-people/jobseekers-
benefit/) (JB) and [ Jobseeker’s Benefit (Self-Employed) ](/en/social-
welfare/unemployed-people/jobseekers-benefit-self-employed/) may be
transferred to another EEA member state for up to 13 weeks (78 days), if you
are looking for work there. You must be getting Jobseeker's Benefit for 4
weeks before you can transfer it to another EEA member state (this requirement
can be waived in some instances). From 1 May 2010 [ new EU Regulations came
into effect ](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/e95f88-operational-guidelines-
jobseekers-benefit/#eu-regulations) which mean that if you apply to transfer
your Jobseeker's Benefit, it will be paid directly to you. If an Increase for
a Qualified Adult (IQA) or Increases for Qualified Children (IQC) are being
paid you continue to be paid these in the normal way (whether your dependents
travel abroad with you or not).

You are still required to register with the employment services of the country
where you have gone to look for work within a week. If you are leaving Ireland
to move to Northern Ireland or Britain, your Intreo Centre or Social Welfare
Branch Office will issue you with the Form U2 (formerly Form E303) which you
take to the UK social services. If you are moving to another EU country, the
Department of Social Protection will send the U2 form to your new address in
that EU country. You may transfer your JB payment more than once while you are
unemployed provided you do not exceed the maximum period of 13 weeks.

If you are claiming JB, you can claim increases for your qualified adult and
children who are living in another EEA member state.

Jobseeker's payments can also be paid on your return from representing Ireland
in an amateur capacity at international sporting event. You must get written
confirmation of the sport and time involved from the governing sporting body.

You should let the Department know that you are taking a holiday at least 2
weeks before you go away. You can do this using [ MyWelfare
](https://www.mywelfare.ie/) if you have a verified account or fill in a
holiday entitlement form at [ your local Intreo Centre or Social Welfare
Branch Office ](https://www.gov.ie/en/directory/category/e1f4b5-intreo-
offices/?referrer=http://www.gov.ie/en/service/40cf48-find-your-local-intreo-
office/) .

  * Deserted Wife's Allowance 
  * [ Guardian's Payment (Non-Contributory) ](/en/social-welfare/death-related-benefits/guardian-and-orphan-payments/)

  * [ Health and Safety Benefit ](/en/social-welfare/families-and-children/health-safety-benefit/)

[ Rent Supplement ](/en/social-welfare/supplementary-welfare-schemes/rent-
supplement/) is not normally payable while you are outside the country. You
should contact the officer dealing with your claim if you intend to leave the
country, even for a short absence. Payment may be made in certain
circumstances for short absences from the country, such as holidays etc., if
the officer dealing with your claims agrees to it.

###  The following payments are not paid if you are outside the State but
there are some exceptions depending on your circumstances

Deserted Wife's Benefit can be paid up to a maximum of 3 weeks.

[ Carer's Allowance ](/en/social-welfare/carers/carers-allowance/) can be paid
if you accompany the person you are caring for abroad to get medical
treatment. You can also go abroad on a respite break for a maximum of 3 weeks.

[ Disability Allowance ](/en/social-welfare/disability-and-illness/disability-
allowance/) can be paid if you are studying an approved course outside the
State under the [ Back to Education Allowance scheme ](/en/social-
welfare/back-to-education/back-to-education-allowance/) or getting medical
treatment not available in Ireland. You must notify the Department and provide
proof of medical treatment or education abroad. Under legislation you have no
entitlement to be paid Disability Allowance while on holiday. However, in
practice Disability Allowance may be paid for 2 weeks while you are on holiday
abroad. You should inform the Department of Social Protection before you go on
holiday.

[ One-Parent Family Payment ](/en/social-welfare/families-and-children/one-
parent-family-payment/) and [ Jobseeker's Transitional payment ](/en/social-
welfare/unemployed-people/jobseekers-transitional-payment/) can be paid up to
a maximum of 3 weeks while you are on holiday abroad. You must notify the
Department in advance that you are going abroad.

If you are getting [ Widow's, Widower's or Surviving Civil Partner's (Non-
Contributory) Pension ](/en/social-welfare/death-related-benefits/widowed-
persons-non-contrib-pension/) , [ State Pension (Non-Contributory)
](/en/social-welfare/older-and-retired-people/state-pension-non-contributory/)
and [ Blind Pension ](/en/social-welfare/disability-and-illness/blind-persons-
pension/) you can go abroad in exceptional circumstances for a limited period
and the Department will review your entitlement when you return. You must
notify the Department before leaving the State. If you are getting State
Pension (Non-Contributory) or Blind Pension and take up residence in Northern
Ireland, the pension is payable until you become entitled to an equivalent
payment from Northern Ireland or for a period of 5 years whichever is the
shorter.

[ Child Benefit ](/en/social-welfare/families-and-children/child-benefit/) can
be paid to volunteer development workers and members of the Irish Defence
Forces or Irish Civil Service serving abroad. It can also be paid if you are
working abroad for an Irish employer and paying Irish social insurance
contributions.
