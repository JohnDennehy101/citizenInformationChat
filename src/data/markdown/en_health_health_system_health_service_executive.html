#  Health Service Executive

  * What does the HSE do? 
  * New HSE health regions 
  * Provision of health and personal social services 
  * Hospital services 
  * Community healthcare services 
  * How you can access health services 

##  What does the HSE do?

The Health Service Executive (HSE) manages all of the public health services
in Ireland including personal social services.

The HSE services are delivered through:

  * Medical professionals such as doctors, nurses, physiotherapists 
  * Hospitals 
  * [ Local Health Offices ](http://www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/1/LHO/)
  * Health centres 
  * Clinics at community level 

The health services include:

  * Promoting good health 
  * Preventing illness (such as food safety services, immunisation and vaccinations services, health screening, infant and child health services) 
  * Diagnosing and treating illness (such as by family doctor (GP) services, hospital services) 

The HSE is also responsible for community care and personal social services to
help people remain living in their communities, especially when they have
difficulties doing so because of illness, disability or age. These include:

  * Home nursing services 
  * Home helps 
  * Occupational therapy 
  * Social work services 

The HSE also has a role in preventing infectious diseases when they occur.

##  New HSE health regions

Starting in 2024, the HSE services will be organised into [ 6 health regions
](https://about.hse.ie/our-work/hse-health-regions/) . Each region will manage
all integrated health services in its area. By the end of 2024, the current
hospital groups and community healthcare services (CHOs) will merge into these
new health regions.

[ The HSE ](https://about.hse.ie/our-work/what-the-hse-does/) will be
responsible for nationally delivered clinical and supporting services and
nationally consistent standards and guidelines.

[ The Department of Health ](https://www.gov.ie/en/organisation/department-of-
health/) will be responsible for setting health policy and strategy and
overseeing health funding.

[ The Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth
(DCEDIY) ](https://www.gov.ie/en/organisation/department-of-children-equality-
disability-integration-and-youth/) will be responsible for policy, legislation
and funding for specialist community-based disability services.

You can read about the current divisions, hospital groups and community
healthcare services below. This page will be updated as the new [ health
regions ](https://about.hse.ie/our-work/hse-health-regions/) come into effect.

##  Provision of health and personal social services

The HSE delivers health and social care services through National Service
Delivery Divisions that deliver services to the public through:

  * Acute hospitals 
  * Social care 
  * Mental health 
  * Primary care 
  * Health and wellbeing 
  * National Ambulance Service 

###  **National Service Delivery Divisions**

The **Acute Hospitals Division** works directly with acute hospitals across
the country. Public hospitals are organised into 7 Hospital Groups â€“ see

The **Social Care Division** supports people to live independently who may
have difficulty in doing so due to illness or disability. The HSE delivers
these services directly or through [ agencies funded by the HSE
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/health/health-system/health-service-
agencies/) .

The **Mental Health Division** aims to provide mental health services by area.

cared for outside of hospital within primary care, such as through their [
family doctor (GP) ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/health/health-
services/gp-and-hospital-services/) and in the community.

The **Health and Wellbeing Division** focuses on protecting and improving
health such as:

  * Public health measures

complex care is provided in larger hospitals.
