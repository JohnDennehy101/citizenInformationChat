##  Introduction

When a marriage first breaks down, many couples informally separate and live
apart. Marital breakdown affects all areas of a person's life, and most people
go on to decide or regulate matters between them in a legal context.

##  Legal options following marriagebreakdown

There are 3 different ways to do this in Ireland:

  * If a married couple or civil partners can agree the terms on which they will live separately, they may enter into a [ separation agreement ](/en/birth-family-relationships/separation-and-divorce/separation-agreement/) . 
  * When a couple cannot agree the terms by which they will live separately, either party can apply to the courts for a decree of [ judicial separation ](/en/birth-family-relationships/separation-and-divorce/judicial-separation/) . 
  * If a court is satisfied that certain conditions are met, the court will grant a decree of [ divorce ](/en/birth-family-relationships/separation-and-divorce/divorce-decrees/) dissolving the marriage. A decree of divorce dissolves a marriage and allows both parties to remarry. 

In specific circumstances, a court can grant a [ nullity decree ](/en/birth-
family-relationships/problems-in-marriages-and-other-relationships/nullity-of-
marriage/) . The effect of a nullity decree is that the court determines that
no marriage ever existed. The law in relation to nullity is complex, and you
should always seek legal advice to assess whether the circumstances exist for
a nullity application. A Roman Catholic Church annulment has no legal effect.

##  What is the difference between aseparation agreement, a judicial
separation and a divorce?

A separation agreement is reached through **agreement between the parties** ,
whereas a **court** grants a judicial separation or a divorce. Of these, only
a decree of divorce dissolves the marriage and allows each party to remarry.

##  Children

Married parents are automatically joint guardians of their children.
Separation or divorce does not change this. However, separation and divorce do
have implications for [ custody and access to children ](/en/birth-family-
relationships/separation-and-divorce/separation-and-divorce-children/) , and
financial matters such as [ maintenance ](/en/birth-family-
relationships/separation-and-divorce/maintenance-orders-and-agreements/) and
the [ family home ](/en/birth-family-relationships/separation-and-
divorce/family-and-shared-home/) .

##  Mediation

Mediation is a process to help couples who have decided to separate or
divorce, or who have already separated, to negotiate their own agreement,
while addressing the needs and interests of all involved. Mediation helps you
to make decisions to suit your circumstances. If you decide to go to court
instead, these decisions will be made by a judge. Mediation is not marriage
counselling or a legal advice service.

The [ Mediation Act 2017
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2017/act/27/enacted/en/html) makes it a
requirement that any couple must be offered mediation as an alternative to
court proceedings. If you are legally represented, any court application must
be accompanied by a declaration from a solicitor confirming that you have been
informed about mediation as an alternative to going to court.

##  If you have to go to court

If you have to go to court to agree the terms of your separation or divorce,
it is always recommended you get legal advice. A solicitor specialising in
family law can help you by explaining the process and your options. Find [
contact information for solicitors throughout Ireland
](https://www.lawsociety.ie/Find-a-Solicitor) on the Law Society website.

You can:

  * Find out about [ case progression ](https://www.courts.ie/case-progression) (the management of your case before the actual hearing) 
  * Watch a video on [ how to prepare for your family law hearing ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xRlTh-_2-w&t=6s) , and 
  * Watch a video on what happens on [ the day you attend the family court ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9r-MwSXvlo)

The Courts Service also has information on the use of interpreters, [ who and
what to expect in the courtroom ](https://courts.ie/what-expect-courtroom) ,
and [ what happens at the end of the hearing ](https://courts.ie/what-expect-
courtroom) .  

##  Further information

The [ Family Mediation Service ](https://www.legalaidboard.ie/en/our-
services/family-mediation/) offers a free mediation service that helps
separating couples co-operate with each other in working out mutually
acceptable arrangements. The Family Mediation Service is provided by the [
Legal Aid Board ](https://www.legalaidboard.ie/en/) .

The [ Mediators' Institute of Ireland ](https://www.themii.ie/) provides a
list of private accredited mediators. Private mediators charge in a variety of
ways (daily rate/hourly rate/flat rate).

Legal aid and advice is available from the [ Legal Aid Board
](https://www.legalaidboard.ie/en/) in family law cases to people who satisfy
a means test. If you wish to engage the services of a [ solicitor
](/en/justice/courtroom/solicitors/) privately, the [ Law Society of Ireland
](https://www.lawsociety.ie/Find-a-Solicitor/) maintains a list of solicitors
in Ireland.
