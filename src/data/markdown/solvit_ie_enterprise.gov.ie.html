#  What We Do

  
  

##  [ Enterprise Innovation ](/en/what-we-do/innovation-research-development/)

Investment in innovation is an essential component of supporting an
enterprising and productive economy. Government support for innovation assists
in creating and maintaining high-value jobs and helps to attract investment
and develop business in Ireland. The department funds and promotes enterprise-
led innovation through a range of programmes and supports delivered for the
most part through Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland.

##  [ Trade & Investment ](/en/what-we-do/trade-investment/)

We drive the development and delivery of the enterprise development programmes
of IDA Ireland, the principal agency charged with attracting foreign direct
investment and promoting Ireland as the best small country in the world to do
business. We promote the development of Ireland’s exports to world markets and
work with Enterprise Ireland to help Irish companies achieve global success.

##  [ Supports for SMEs ](/en/what-we-do/supports-for-smes/)

We provide a range of tailored supports for enterprise of all sizes in
Ireland. Supports include access to finance, management development, mentoring
supports, business development programmes, market supports and trade
promotion.

##  [ The Business Environment ](/en/what-we-do/the-business-environment/)

The department engages with key stakeholders to address issues that arise on a
business or sectoral basis across all areas of enterprise activity. These
business and sectoral initiatives are across a wide range of areas covering
internationally traded goods and services as well as the domestically traded
sector.

##  [ Workplace & Skills ](/en/what-we-do/workplace-and-skills/)

We ensure through work at national and international levels that workplaces
are safe, employment rights are respected, harmonious industrial relations are
promoted and any disputes or breaches are handled efficiently and effectively;
that skills needs are identified and met through alignment of education and
training provision and, as required, through targeted and efficient economic
migration.

##  [ EU & Internal Market ](/en/what-we-do/eu-internal-market/)

We have a leadership and coordination role in respect of the EU
Competitiveness Council and on the Single Market and generally in driving the
department’s EU agenda. We engage proactively at EU institutional level and
with our EU partners so as to ensure that departmental EU priority measures
are advanced.

##  [ Company & Corporate Law ](/en/what-we-do/company-corporate-law/)

Company law provides the legislative framework for the structure and operation
of companies registered in Ireland, whether domestic or foreign. It seeks to
ensure a balance between simplifying the day-to-day running of a business,
maintaining necessary protections for those dealing with companies, such as
creditors and investors, and putting in place an effective corporate
governance regime to ensure compliance.

##  [ Consumer & Competition ](/en/what-we-do/consumer-competition/)

To help make markets work effectively for consumers and for the economy as a
whole, our work falls under two main headings: national policy and EU policy
on current competition and consumer matters; and supporting as well as
liaising with and monitoring the Competition and Consumer Protection
Commission.
