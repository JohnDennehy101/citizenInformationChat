  * Important things to do before returning 
  * Check if your passport is valid 
  * Immigration and customs 
  * Shipping your personal belongings home 
  * Bringing your vehicle to Ireland 
  * Bringing your pet to Ireland 

##  Introduction

This page can help you plan your journey home to Ireland.

It covers the important things to do before returning home from abroad, such
as gathering your medical records and children’s school reports. It also has
information on shipping your belongings, car, and travelling home with a pet.

##  Important things to do before returning

###  **Prepare to find somewhere to live**

To help you find somewhere to live, you should gather relevant documents from
the country you’re leaving, such as:

  * References from your current landlord 
  * Proof you have ended your tenancy abroad 
  * Proof you have sold property abroad. 

Before you arrive, research [ renting
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/housing/renting-a-home/looking-for-a-
flat-or-house-to-rent/) or [ buying
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/housing/owning-a-home/buying-a-
home/steps-involved-buying-a-home/) a home in Ireland. If this is not an
option, you may be able to apply for [ social housing
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/housing/local-authority-and-social-
housing/applying-for-local-authority-housing/) and get a [ Housing Assistance
Payment (HAP) ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/housing/renting-a-
home/help-with-renting/housing-assistance-payment/) , however you will need to
meet certain criteria before your application is accepted.

Read our page on [ housing supports for returning emigrants
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/returning-to-ireland/finding-
somewhere-to-live/guide-to-housing-supports-for-returning-irish-emigrants/)
for more information.

###  **Enrol children in school**

If you’re returning with children, bring their recent school reports and test
results to help their new school determine what class suits their needs.

You can book your child’s school places in advance. See our pages on:

  * [ Enrolling your child in primary school ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/returning-to-ireland/education-and-schooling/enrolling-your-child-in-a-primary-school-after-returning-to-ireland/)
  * [ Enrolling your child in secondary school ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/returning-to-ireland/education-and-schooling/enrolling-your-child-in-a-secondary-school-after-returning-to-ireland/)

You and your children may also be eligible for [ free tuition
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/education/third-level-education/fees-
and-supports-for-third-level-education/fees/) on a publicly funded [ third-
level
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/education/third_level_education/)
course. Read our information on the [ Irish education system
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/education/the_irish_education_system/)
for more information.

###  **Gather your medical records**

Before returning to Ireland, ask your doctor for copies of your medical
records, prescriptions for drugs and medicines, and immunisation records for
you and your family.

Read more about [ accessing healthcare on your return to Ireland
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/returning-to-ireland/looking-after-
your-health/accessing-healthcare-on-your-return-to-ireland/) .

###  **Find work**

If possible, you should try and secure a job before returning to Ireland. You
can prepare your CV (resumé) before you move. You can also ask your most
recent employer to give you a reference.

Read more about [ working in Ireland after living abroad
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/returning-to-ireland/starting-
work/working-in-Ireland-after-living-abroad/) .

##  Check if your passport is valid

Ideally, your passport should be valid for 6 months after the date you return
home. If it is due to expire, you should [ renew your passport
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/travel-and-
recreation/passports/renewing-an-irish-passport/) at least 6 weeks before you
travel. If your [ passport is lost or stolen
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/travel-and-
recreation/passports/replacing-a-lost-or-stolen-irish-passport/) , you should
report it missing and replace it.

If you are a dual citizen, you can travel on either of your passports.
However, we would recommend that you use your [ Irish passport
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/travel_and_recreation/passports/) when
travelling to Ireland.

You can use a [ passport card ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/travel-
and-recreation/passports/irish-passport-card/) if you’re travelling from
certain European countries.

Children must have their own passport. If your child is eligible for an Irish
passport, you can [ apply for their first Irish passport
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/travel-and-
recreation/passports/passports-for-children/) before you move.

Visit the [ Passport Online website
](https://www.ireland.ie/en/dfa/passports/passport-online/) for more
information.

##  Immigration and customs

If you are an Irish citizen, you do not need immigration permission to return
to Ireland.

If you’re returning to Ireland with members of your family who are not Irish
citizens (such as a [ de facto partner
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/returning-to-ireland/residency-and-
citizenship/returning-to-ireland-with-your-de-facto-partner/) , [ spouse, or
civil partner ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/returning-to-
ireland/residency-and-citizenship/returning-to-ireland-with-your-non-eea-
spouse/) ) they may need immigration permission to live and work here.

Read the [ residency and citizenship
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/returning_to_ireland/residency_and_citizenship/)
section of our website for more information.

###  **Customs and related charges**

When you arrive, [ customs officers may carry out checks
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/travel-and-recreation/travel-to-
ireland/examination-of-travellers-baggage-by-customs-and-excise-officers/) on
your belongings, including personal baggage. This is to make sure you are not
carrying prohibited or restricted goods.

Check the [ customs regulations
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/travel-and-recreation/travel-to-
ireland/customs-regulations-for-travellers/) to see how much cash, tobacco and
alcohol you can bring into the country. You may have to pay [ import charges
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/returning-to-ireland/planning-your-
journey-home/shipping-your-belongings-back-to-ireland/#11d1b1) , such as
customs duty and Value Added Tax. However, you can [ get relief from import
charges ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/returning-to-ireland/planning-
your-journey-home/shipping-your-belongings-back-to-ireland/#24a38a) on certain
items.

##  Shipping your personal belongings home

If you’re returning to Ireland for an extended period of time, you will need
to [ ship your belongings home
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/returning-to-ireland/planning-your-
journey-home/shipping-your-belongings-back-to-ireland/) .

When you’re deciding what to ship, be aware that the cost will depend on size,
weight and shape. If possible, get sales receipts or invoices for all the
items you’re shipping.

Depending on the type of goods you’re shipping, and where they’re coming from,
[ import charges ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/returning-to-
ireland/planning-your-journey-home/shipping-your-belongings-back-to-
ireland#l683b4) such as customs duty and [ Value Added Tax
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/money-and-tax/tax/duties-and-
vat/value-added-tax/) may apply.

You may be able to claim [ tax relief
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/returning-to-ireland/planning-your-
journey-home/shipping-your-belongings-back-to-ireland#l683b4) for certain
items. Revenue has a full list of rules on [ relief from Customs Duty and VAT
](https://www.revenue.ie/en/customs/individuals/transfer-residence/rules.aspx)
.

##  Bringing your vehicle to Ireland

Before you import your vehicle, make sure you have all the [ documentation
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/moving-country/moving-to-
ireland/coming-to-live-in-ireland/importing-car-into-ireland/) that you need.

When [ importing a vehicle into Ireland
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/moving-country/moving-to-
ireland/coming-to-live-in-ireland/importing-car-into-ireland/) , you may need
to pay a Vehicle Registration Tax (VRT). Revenue has information on [ VRT
exemptions ](https://www.revenue.ie/en/importing-vehicles-duty-free-
allowances/guide-to-vrt/reliefs-and-exemptions/index.aspx) and a calculator
that will tell you [ how much you may owe ](https://www.ros.ie/evrt-
enquiry/vrtenquiry.html?execution=e1s1) . You will also need to [ register the
vehicle ](https://www.ncts.ie/vrt-home/) with the National Car Testing Service
(NCTS), get motor insurance, and pay motor tax.

You may be able to [ claim relief from VAT and customs duties on your vehicle
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/returning-to-ireland/planning-your-
journey-home/shipping-your-belongings-back-to-ireland#l9b927) .

##  Bringing your pet to Ireland

The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine (DAFM) controls the [
importation of pets into Ireland
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/moving-country/moving-to-
ireland/coming-to-live-in-ireland/bringing-pets-to-ireland/) . You are allowed
to bring a [ maximum of 5 pets
](http://www.pettravel.gov.ie/pets/dogscatsferrets/other/#:~:text=Your%20pet%20must%20arrive%20in,country%20you%20are%20travelling%20from.)
with you to Ireland under [ pet travel rules
](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/21d40-pet-
travel/?referrer=http://www.gov.ie/en/service/28ae66-pet-travel/#transiting-
ireland-with-pet-cat-dog-or-ferrets) . Different [ rules apply if you are
bringing more than 5 pets ](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/ffadc-
commercial-dog-cat-or-ferret-movements/) . You must have original paperwork
for all pets, not copies. Your pet must also arrive with you, or 5 days before
or after you travel.

There are different rules and procedures depending on the type of pet you are
bringing to Ireland and where they are travelling from. Find out more about:

  * [ Bringing a cat, dog or ferret to Ireland ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/moving-country/moving-to-ireland/coming-to-live-in-ireland/bringing-pets-to-ireland#lc8a2c)

and microchipping.
