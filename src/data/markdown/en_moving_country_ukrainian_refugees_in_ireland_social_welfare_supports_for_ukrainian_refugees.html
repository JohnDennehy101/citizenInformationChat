##  Income support

If you come to Ireland from Ukraine and you are covered by the [ EU Temporary
Protection Directive ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/moving-
country/asylum-seekers-and-refugees/the-asylum-process-in-ireland/temporary-
protection-directive/) , you can get income support from the Department of
Social Protection (DSP).

The type of income support you get depends on if you are in State-provided
accommodation or not – see ‘What social welfare payment can I get?’ below.

To get any Irish social welfare payment, you need a Personal Public Service
Number (PPS number).

###  Personal Public Service number (PPS number)

A [ PPS number is a unique reference number ](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-
welfare-system/personal-public-service-number/) that helps you access social
welfare payments, public services and information in Ireland. A PPS number is
always 7 numbers followed by either one or 2 letters.

If you arrive at Dublin Airport, you will be brought to the City West
Convention Centre in Dublin. You can apply for your PPS number there.

If you did not arrive through Dublin Airport or you are in Ireland already,
you should go to your [ local Intreo centre or DSP branch office
](https://www.gov.ie/en/directory/category/e1f4b5-intreo-
offices/?referrer=http://www.gov.ie/en/service/40cf48-find-your-local-intreo-
office/) , to apply for a PPS number.

You need identification (ID) to get your Irish PPS number. This can be your
Ukrainian National Identity Card or your Ukrainian passport.

####  PPS number award letter

Shortly after you apply, you will get a letter from the DSP with your new PPS
number. This is your ‘PPS number award letter’. It is an important document.

You will need it to collect your social welfare payment.

##  What social welfare payment can I get?

###  From 14 March 2024

From 14 March 2024, if you register for temporary protection and State-
provided accommodation, you will be accommodated for a maximum of 90 days in a
[ Designated Accommodation Centre ](https://www.gov.ie/en/press-
release/54291-changes-to-accommodation-for-people-fleeing-war-in-ukraine/) .

You will get a [ weekly payment ](https://www.gov.ie/en/service/894dd-
beneficiary-of-temporary-protection-weekly-payment/) of €38.80 for an adult
and €29.80 for a child. If you have any qualified children, you will also get
a monthly [ Child Benefit ](/en/social-welfare/families-and-children/child-
benefit/) payment.

You can read more about [ income supports and State-provided accommodation
](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/f011b-income-supports-for-those-arriving-
from-ukraine-under-the-eu-temporary-protection-directive/) .

If you are not in State-provided accommodation, you can apply for [ social
welfare payments ](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/claiming-a-
social-welfare-payment/applying-for-a-social-welfare-payment/) in the same way
as Irish citizens, as long as you meet the eligibility conditions.

###  Before 14 March 2024

If you registered for temporary protection and State-provided accommodation
before 14 March 2024, you could get [ social welfare payments
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-
system/claiming-a-social-welfare-payment/applying-for-a-social-welfare-
payment/) in the same way as Irish citizens, as long as you met the
eligibility conditions.

###  **From 9 September 2024**

However, from 9 September 2024, if you are living in a [ Designated
Accommodation Centre ](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/9957c-designated-
accommodation-centres-current-availability/) where meals and utilities are
provided, and you arrived in Ireland before 14 March 2024, you no longer
qualify for some social welfare payments. You will get the same rate of
payment as people who arrived after this date.

This means you will get a [ weekly payment
](https://www.gov.ie/en/service/894dd-beneficiary-of-temporary-protection-
weekly-payment/) of €38.80 for an adult and €29.80 for a child, subject to an
income test. You will still be entitled to the [ Working Family Payment
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/families-and-
children/working-family-payment/) and a monthly [ Child Benefit
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/social-welfare-
payments/families-and-children/child-benefit/) payment for qualifying
children. You can also apply for an [ Additional Needs Payment
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/supplementary-welfare-
schemes/additional-needs-payment/) .

  * If you are affected by the changes, you will get a letter from the Department of Social Protection. 
  * Designation of accommodation centres will be effective from September 2024. 
  * You will get a reduced payment from Thursday, 12 September 2024. 

If you leave a Designated Accommodation Centre or make your own accommodation
arrangements when you arrive in Ireland, you can apply for social welfare
payments, if you meet the standard eligibility conditions.

##  Applying for a social welfare payment

If you need help applying for a social welfare payment, you can visit your [
local Intreo centre or DSP branch office
](https://www.gov.ie/en/directory/category/e1f4b5-intreo-
offices/?referrer=http://www.gov.ie/en/service/40cf48-find-your-local-intreo-
office/) .

Your local [ Citizens Information Centre
](https://centres.citizensinformation.ie/) can also give you help and advice
on social welfare payments.

When you apply for a social welfare payment, you should provide information
about any [ children ](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-
system/claiming-a-social-welfare-payment/claiming-and-increase-in-your-
payment-for-a-child-dependant/) or [ adult dependents ](/en/social-
welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/claiming-a-social-welfare-
payment/claiming-an-increase-in-your-social-welfare-payment-for-an-adult-
dependant/) you may have. You could get an increase in your payment for them.

##  Collecting your social welfare payment

You collect your first social welfare payment at [ your nearest Post Office
](https://www.anpost.com/#storelocator) , called An Post.

The Department of Social Protection will send you a letter to let you know
when your payment will be at the Post Office for you to collect.

You need to bring your ‘PPS number award letter’ and your ID with you to
collect your payment at the Post Office.

You can [ use MyWelfare to change the Post Office
](https://services.mywelfare.ie/en/topics/ukraine-emergency-supports/ukraine-
change-of-post-office/) where you are being paid. You can only use this
service if you are covered by the EU Temporary Protection Directive.

####  Other financial services

You can continue to get paid at your local Post Office or apply to have your
payment made directly into your financial institution. Payments can only be
made to an Irish financial institution, a Revolut or N26 account.

##  Work and social welfare payments

You can use the [ benefit of work estimator
](https://www.mywelfare.ie/benefitofworkjsestimator) to check if income from
work, including part time work, will affect your social welfare payment.

If you are getting a social welfare payment and you find work, you must tell
your [ local Intreo centre or DSP branch office
](https://www.gov.ie/en/directory/category/e1f4b5-intreo-
offices/?referrer=http://www.gov.ie/en/service/40cf48-find-your-local-intreo-
office/) .

##  Changes to your situation

You must always tell the Department of Social Protection if there is any
change in your circumstances. Some examples of a change in your circumstances
are:

  * You start work (paid or unpaid), including remote working, in Ireland or elsewhere 
  * You get any other income 
  * You move to [ different accommodation or change your address ](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/abf3e-social-welfare-supports-for-ukrainian-citizens-arriving-in-ireland-under-the-temporary-protection-directive/#what-to-do-if-you-change-address)
  * Your spouse, civil partner, cohabitant or child no longer lives with you 
  * You start a course of education or become a full-time student
