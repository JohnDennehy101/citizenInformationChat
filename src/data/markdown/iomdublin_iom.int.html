##  IOM Strategic Plan 2024-2028

The IOM Strategic Plan is aimed at delivering on the promise of safe, orderly,
and regular migration while supporting the world’s most vulnerable. The plan –
which will guide the Organization's activities through 2028 – was developed
after extensive internal consultations, including with migrants themselves, as
well as dialogue with Member States, with other partners and other United
Nations agencies.

The Global Annual Appeal for 2024 calls for USD 7.9 billion to support its
operations and help create a system that realizes migration’s promise as a
force for good throughout the world. The IOM Global Appeal seeks funding to
save lives and protect people on the move, drive solutions to displacement,
and facilitate safe pathways for regular migration – the key aspirations of
IOM’s new five-year Global Strategic Plan.
