##  What is the Home School Community Liaison Scheme?

The [ Home School Community Liaison Scheme (HCSL)
](https://www.gov.ie/en/service/6c72da-home-school-community-liaison-scheme-
hscl/) supports students with poor attendance at school and who are at risk of
leaving school early.

The scheme is funded through the Department of Education and is managed by [
Tusla’s Educational Support Service (TESS) ](https://www.tusla.ie/tess/) .

The HSCL Scheme aims to:

  * Support you to be a resource to your children and become involved in your child’s education 
  * Promote co-operation between home, school and relevant community agencies in the educational interests of your child 
  * Help your child’s learning and improve their chances of staying in school 

##  What is a Home School Community Liaison co-ordinator?

A HSCL co-ordinator is a designated teacher in a school who works with parents
or guardians of students who are experiencing, or likely to experience,
educational disadvantage. They engage with parents, the school and the
community, and they offer support and guidance to help students reach their
full potential.

The HSCL co-ordinator can:

  * [ Visit you at home ](https://www.tusla.ie/tess/information-for-parents-and-guardians-tess/home-school-liaison-community-liaison/what-is-a-home-visit/) to build a relationship between home and school (see ‘Home School Community Liaison Scheme and home visits’ below) 
  * Provide information about possible book rental schemes, local uniform suppliers, school subjects, and [ after school activities ](https://www.tusla.ie/tess/information-for-parents-and-guardians-tess/home-school-liaison-community-liaison/can-the-hscl-coordinator-give-me-information-about-after-school-activities-and-supports-available-for-my-child/)
  * Organise [ recreational or educational classes for parents based on their interests ](https://www.tusla.ie/tess/information-for-parents-and-guardians-tess/home-school-liaison-community-liaison/what-is-a-course-for-parents/) (for example, cooking, computer or fitness classes, or classes about parenting skills or children transitioning to a new school) 
  * Support you and your family as your child [ moves through the education system ](https://www.tusla.ie/tess/information-for-parents-and-guardians-tess/home-school-liaison-community-liaison/can-the-hscl-coordinator-offer-support-around-my-childs-transition/)

The HSCL co-ordinator provides updates on your child’s progress and
attendance, listens to your views as a parent, and provides information about
the school and about services available in the community.

The co-ordinator works closely with the [ School Completion Programme
](https://www.tusla.ie/tess/information-for-parents-and-guardians-tess/school-
completion-programme-pg/) and the [ Education Welfare Service
](https://www.tusla.ie/tess/information-for-parents-and-guardians-
tess/education-welfare-service/) .

##  How can I access the Home School Community Liaison Scheme?

The HSCL is available in [ all urban DEIS schools and in all DEIS post-primary
schools ](https://www.gov.ie/en/service/6c72da-home-school-community-liaison-
scheme-hscl/#eligible-schools) .

The school will identify children who need HSCL support. Parents or guardians
and children who may get HSCL support include children who are:

  * Getting support from the School Completion Programme 
  * Referred to the Education Social Welfare Service 
  * Involved with Tusla social work or who are in care 

Contact the school principal for more information.
