#  Educational arrangements for Travellers

  * Traveller education 

##  Traveller education

Traveller children have the same rights to education as settled children. They
are also subject to the same rules on [ school attendance
](/en/education/primary-and-post-primary-education/attendance-and-discipline-
in-schools/school-attendance/) .

A Traveller child can access additional learning [ supports in primary school
](/en/education/special-education-needs/special-needs-education-primary-
schools/) and [ supports in post-primary school ](/en/education/special-
education-needs/post-primary-education-for-students-with-special-needs/) if
there is an identified educational need.

Travellers were formally recognised as a distinct ethnic group within the
Irish State in March 2017. The [ National Traveller and Roma Inclusion
Strategy 2017-2021(pdf)
](https://assets.gov.ie/43310/d7d54fbff0f4418982856e7dddaf78c1.pdf) is a
cross-Departmental initiative to improve the lives of the Traveller and Roma
communities in Ireland. The Department of Education, Tusla and Traveller
Representative Groups collaborate on education related measures proposed in
the strategy, to improve Traveller engagement with education.

###  Co-ordination of Traveller education

The Advisory Committee on Traveller Education published a [ Report and
Recommendations for a Traveller Education Strategy (pdf) ](https://s3-eu-
west-1.amazonaws.com/govieassets/24633/d2c07c84c48f4a6e9984f15ff6d34728.pdf) .
A key objective of the report was the phasing out of segregated Traveller
provision and the inclusion of Traveller children and young people in
mainstream education.

Guidelines on Traveller education in primary schools and post-primary schools
are available from the Department of Education.

The Department of Education is responsible for the [ co-ordination of
Traveller education ](https://www.gov.ie/en/policy-information/531ef5-co-
ordination-of-traveller-education/) at primary and post primary level.

The Department of Further and Higher Education is responsible for Traveller
education at further education and higher education.
