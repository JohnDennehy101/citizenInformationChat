#  Marital status and social welfare entitlements

  * Introduction 
  * One-Parent Family Payment 
  * Jobseeker's Transitional Payment 
  * Widow's/Widower's or Surviving CivilPartner's Pension 
  * Widowed or Surviving Civil Partner’s Grant 
  * More information 

##  Introduction

For the purposes of most social welfare payments in Ireland (for example, [
Jobseeker's Allowance ](/en/social-welfare/unemployed-people/jobseekers-
allowance/) and [ Supplementary Welfare Allowance ](/en/social-
welfare/supplementary-welfare-schemes/supplementary-welfare-allow/) ), couples
who are cohabiting (living together) are treated in the same way as married
couples or civil partners. However, your marital status can affect your
entitlement to certain social welfare payments.

##  One-Parent Family Payment

[ One-Parent Family Payment (OFP) ](/en/social-welfare/families-and-
children/one-parent-family-payment/) is not paid to a person who is in a
relationship and living with that person whether they are of the opposite or
of the same sex. To qualify for OFP, you must be widowed, separated, divorced,
unmarried, have a dissolved civil partnership, or be a prisoner’s spouse or
civil partner. You must not be cohabiting. Cohabiting is when a couple in a
relationship live together, but they are not married or in a civil
partnership.

If you separate, divorce or dissolve your civil partnership, you must live
apart for at least 3 months before making a claim for One-Parent Family
Payment. If you are cohabiting and your relationship breaks down, you can
apply without having to wait 3 months.

##  Jobseeker's Transitional Payment

You may get [ Jobseeker’s Transitional Payment (JST) ](/en/social-
welfare/unemployed-people/jobseekers-transitional-payment/) , if you have
children and do not qualify for OFP.

You cannot get JST if you are living with your spouse, partner or civil
partner. If you are married and separate, you must be separated for 3 months
before you can get Jobseeker’s Transitional Payment .

If you are cohabiting (living with someone and in a relationship) and your
relationship breaks down, you can apply for Jobseeker's Transitional Payment
from the first day you become a lone parent.

##  Widow's/Widower's or Surviving CivilPartner's Pension

Your marital status does affect your entitlement to [ Widow's/Widower's or
Surviving Civil Partner's (Contributory) Pension ](/en/social-welfare/death-
related-benefits/widowed-persons-contrib-pension/) or [ Widow's/Widower's or
Surviving Civil Partner's (Non-Contributory) Pension ](/en/social-
welfare/death-related-benefits/widowed-persons-non-contrib-pension/) . You can
only claim a Widow's/Widower's or Surviving Civil Partner's Pension if your
spouse or civil partner dies. The pension remains payable while you remain
widowed or a surviving civil partner. If you re-marry or start to cohabit, it
is no longer payable.

##  Widowed or Surviving Civil Partner’s Grant

Your marital status affects your entitlement to the [ Widowed or Surviving
Civil Partner’s Grant ](/en/social-welfare/death-related-benefits/widowed-
parents-bereavement-grant/) .

The Widowed or Surviving Civil Partner Grant is a once-off payment to widows,
widowers or surviving civil partners with dependent children. Cohabitants are
not eligible for the grant.
