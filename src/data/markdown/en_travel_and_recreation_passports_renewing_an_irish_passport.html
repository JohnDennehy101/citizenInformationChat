##  Introduction

This page explains how to renew your [ Irish passport ](/en/travel-and-
recreation/passports/irish-passports-an-overview/) if you are over 18 years
old.

You **must be an** [ **Irish citizen** ](/en/moving-country/irish-
citizenship/your-right-to-irish-citizenship/) to be eligible for an Irish
passport.

Irish passports for adults are valid for 10 years. To continue to travel
abroad after the time expires, you must apply to renew your Irish passport.
You may also want to apply to renew your passport because:

  * Your passport was [ lost, stolen or damaged ](/en/travel-and-recreation/passports/replacing-a-lost-or-stolen-irish-passport/)
  * You have [ changed your name ](/en/travel-and-recreation/passports/renewing-an-irish-passport#lc8a05)

If your most recent passport was issued [ more than 15 years ago
](https://www.ireland.ie/en/dfa/passports/documentary-requirements/adult/) ,
you must apply as a [ first time applicant
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/travel-and-
recreation/passports/applying-for-or-renewing-an-irish-passport/) .

You can renew your passport at any time. If you apply for a new passport
before your current one has expired, your new passport will run from when you
apply.

**Three ways to renew your Irish passport:**

  * Online, through [ Passport Online ](https://www.ireland.ie/en/dfa/passports/passport-online/)
  * By post, through [ Post Passport ](https://www.ireland.ie/en/dfa/passports/post-passport/)
  * In person, through the [ Passport Office’s counter service ](https://www.ireland.ie/en/dfa/passports/urgent-appointment/)

##  Renewing your passport through Passport Online

You can [ renew an Irish passport online
](https://www.ireland.ie/en/dfa/passports/passport-online/) , following the
step-by-step instructions provided.

You do not have to verify your identity when renewing your passport using the
online service. If your current passport has more than 12 months of validity
at the time of your renewal application, you will have to send the original
passport by post.

###  Digital photographs

You must include a digital photo as part of your application. You can do this
through a participating photo provider like a pharmacy.

**Photo was taken at a participating photo provider**

They can help you in one of 2 ways:

  * They can give you a unique code to include with your online application 
  * Ask them to email it to you, or save the photo on a USB device, or other storage methods. You must have access to the photo when completing your online application 

**Take the photo yourself**

  * Take a photo at home using a digital camera or smartphone. This cannot be a “selfie” and you should not use the zoom function of your camera. The photo must capture your image from the waist upwards. 

You can read more about the [ photo requirements for the Passport Online
service ](https://www.ireland.ie/en/dfa/passports/photo-guidelines/) .

##  Renewing by post through Post Passport

[ Post Passport ](https://www.anpost.com/Government-Services/Post-Passport) is
a service provided by An Post. Post Passport is open. [ Updates on services
](https://www.ireland.ie/en/dfa/passports/updates/) are available on the
Passport Service's website.

If you are an Irish citizen living in Ireland, you should fill in form APS 1.
You will find this form at Garda stations and any Post Office. It is not
currently possible to download the paper application form.

If your current passport has more than 12 months of validity at the time of
your renewal application, you will have to send the original passport by post.

###  Photographs

You must include 4 recent identical photographs of yourself with your
application.

2 of these photographs should be signed on the back by [ the person who
witnesses the application ](https://www.ireland.ie/en/dfa/passports/how-to-
get-your-application-witnessed/) . The witness should also write the form
number shown in Section 9 of the application form on the 2 signed photographs.
If you are applying for your passport in Ireland the witness must be a member
of the Garda Síochána.

[ More detailed information on passport photographs is available on the
Passport Service website ](https://www.ireland.ie/en/dfa/passports/photo-
guidelines/) .

###  Post Passport abroad

Several [ UK Post Office branches in Northern Ireland provide the Post
Passport service (pdf)
](https://www.dfa.ie/media/dfa/howtogetapassportpdfs/nipx-list-16-nov-07-for-
website.pdf) .

The following post offices in the UK also offer Post Passport:

  * Cardiff Post Office, 83 - 85 Queen Street, Cardiff, CF10 2NX 
  * Glasgow Post Office, 140 West Nile Street, Glasgow, G1 2RD 
  * Liverpool Post Office, 1 – 3 South John Street, Liverpool, L1 8BN 

If you are applying abroad, suitable categories of witnesses are listed on the
application form. The witness should enter their daytime contact number on the
application form as this may need to be verified by the Passport Service or
the relevant embassy or consulate.

##  Renewing your passport in person

The counter service at the Passport Office is mainly designed to help people
who need their passports urgently, and don’t have enough time to apply in
other ways. In these cases, you should book an appointment with the Passport
Office in Dublin or Cork. Information on the Urgent Appointment Service is
below.

**If you are living abroad** and unable to use Passport Online, you can apply
for an Irish passport in person, or using ordinary or registered post to your
[ nearest Irish embassy or consulate
](https://www.ireland.ie/en/dfa/embassies/) . You use form APS 2.

You cannot download the application form. You can get the application form
from the Irish embassy or consulate in the country where you live (or the
closest embassy or consulate).

##  Fees for passport renewals

The fees are:

**Standard 34-page 10-year passport**

**Service** |  **Cost**  
---|---  
**Passport Online** |  €75 plus a €15 postage if you live outside Ireland

##  How long will my passport renewal take?

](https://www.ireland.ie/en/dfa/passports/documentary-requirements/) or you
are changing information on your passport. You could be changing your name or
reporting a lost or stolen passport.

your application to be processed (not including postage times). This period
may be extended at certain times of the year due to increased application
numbers.

](https://www.ireland.ie/en/dfa/passports/turnaround-times/) for current
processing times.

###  Tracking the progress of your passport application

The Passport Service provides a [ Passport Tracking Service
](https://www.ireland.ie/en/dfa/passports/tracking/) , which allows you to
check the status of your application online. To do this, you must have the
application number from your form (available in the top left-hand corner of
the form).

The [ Urgent Appointment Service
](https://www.ireland.ie/en/dfa/passports/urgent-appointment/) offices are

Affairs can issue an emergency travel document of limited validity. Examples
of such emergencies are:

  * Situations of substantial distress such as the deaths or funerals of immediate family members abroad 
  * Urgent medical attention abroad 

It is not possible for an emergency travel document to be issued to:

  * Minors (except in extremely limited circumstances) 
  * First time applicants 

Emergency travel documents may also be issued by Irish embassies or
consulates, to [ replace a passport that is lost or stolen ](/en/travel-and-
recreation/passports/replacing-a-lost-or-stolen-irish-passport/) abroad.

##  Additional documentation you may need

documents that show you have been continually using the name for at least 2
years.

have proof that you have been continually using it for 2 years, 6 months’
usage may be accepted. If the proof of 6 months’ usage is accepted, the
English version of your name will also be noted on the passport.

If your documents are not in English you must also supply a certified English
version, translated by a [ registered translator
](http://www.translatorsassociation.ie/) .

###  Gender recognition

Recognition Certificate ](/en/birth-family-relationships/legal-recognition-of-
preferred-gender/) from the Department of Social Protection. You need to
submit your Gender Recognition Certificate and your birth certificate as re-
issued after gender recognition.

](https://www.ireland.ie/en/dfa/passports/documentary-requirements/) , you
have to supply documentary evidence that you have been using the name
continually for at least 2 years. You will have to give a Statutory
Declaration stating that you have the intention of living in the new gender
