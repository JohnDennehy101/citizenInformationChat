#  Overview of the Irish education system

  * Education in Ireland 
  * Pre-school education 
  * Primary education 
  * Post-primary education 
  * Special needs education for students with disabilities 
  * Further and adult education 
  * Third-level education 

##  Education in Ireland

The Irish education system is made up of [ primary school
](/en/education/primary-and-post-primary-education/going-to-primary-
school/starting-primary-school/) and [ post-primary school
](/en/education/primary-and-post-primary-education/going-to-post-primary-
school/starting-post-primary-school/) (also know as secondary school). You
must ensure that your child gets a [ certain minimum education from the age of
6 to 16 ](/en/education/primary-and-post-primary-education/attendance-and-
discipline-in-schools/school-attendance/) or until they have completed 3 years
of post-primary education.

Primary and post-primary schools must provide places based on their [ school
admissions policy and admissions notice ](/en/education/the-irish-education-
system/admissions-policies-in-primary-and-secondary-schools/) .

Many people continue on after post-primary to [ further education
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/education/vocational_education_and_training/)
and [ third-level education
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/education/third_level_education/) .
State-funded education is available at all levels, unless you choose to send
your child to a private school.

##  Pre-school education

The [ Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) Scheme ](/en/education/pre-
school-education-and-childcare/early-childhood-care-and-education-scheme/)
provides free early childhood care and education for children of pre-school
age.

Other than the ECCE, [ pre-school education
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/education/pre_school_education_and_childcare/)
is usually provided by privately funded childcare services. However, the [
National Childcare Scheme (NCS) ](/en/education/pre-school-education-and-
childcare/national-childcare-scheme/) provides financial support to help
parents to meet the costs of private childcare.

The Department of Education also funds some [ pre-school initiatives focused
on children at risk ](/en/education/primary-and-post-primary-
education/attendance-and-discipline-in-schools/home-school-liaison/) .

##  Primary education

Children do not have to attend school until the age of 6.

Usually, children start primary school when they are 5 years of age. They
start in September - the beginning of the school year.

The Irish [ primary school curriculum ](/en/education/primary-and-post-
primary-education/going-to-primary-school/primary-school-curriculum/) is
child-centred.

Generally, children are required to study Irish in school. Some children may
be [ exempted from learning Irish in school ](/en/education/the-irish-
education-system/exemption-from-irish/) .

Find out more about [ choosing a primary school ](/en/education/primary-and-
post-primary-education/going-to-primary-school/choosing-a-primary-school/) for
your child.

##  Post-primary education

Post-primary education is provided by different [ types of post-primary
schools ](/en/education/primary-and-post-primary-education/going-to-post-
primary-school/types-of-post-primary-school/) .

Post-primary education has 2 stages:

  * Junior Cycle – age 12 to 15 (approximately) 
  * Senior Cycle - age 16 to 18 (approximately) 

###  Junior Cycle and examinations

Students generally start the [ Junior Cycle ](/en/education/primary-and-post-
primary-education/going-to-post-primary-school/junior-cycle/) at the age of 12
and take the Junior Cycle Profile of Achievement (JCPA) examination at the end
of 3 years.

###  Senior Cycle and examinations

Children can have a 2 or 3-year Senior Cycle. The Senior Cycle is 3 years, if
you opt to include [ Transition Year ](/en/education/primary-and-post-primary-
education/going-to-post-primary-school/transition-year/) .

The Transition year allows students to experience a wide range of educational
instruction and work experience.

During their final 2 years in the [ Senior Cycle ](/en/education/primary-and-
post-primary-education/going-to-post-primary-school/senior-cycle/) , students
take one of 3 programmes, each leading to a State examination:

  * Established Leaving Certificate 
  * Leaving Certificate Vocational Programme 
  * Leaving Certificate Applied 

The [ established Leaving Certificate ](/en/education/state-
examinations/leaving-certificate/) is the main basis on which students are
allocated places in universities, institutes of technology and colleges of
education.

The [ Leaving Certificate Vocational Programme ](/en/education/state-
examinations/leaving-certificate-vocational-programme/) has elements of the
established Leaving Certificate but concentrates on technical subjects and
includes additional modules with a vocational focus.

The [ Leaving Certificate Applied Programme ](/en/education/state-
examinations/leaving-certificate-applied/) aims to prepare students for adult
and working life through relevant learning experiences. It is for students who
wish to follow a practical or vocational programme. It is not recognised for
direct entry to third-level courses but it can enable students to take [ Post-
Leaving Certificate courses ](/en/education/further-education-and-
training/post-leaving-certificate-courses/) .

##  Special needs education for students with disabilities

Educational provision for [ students with special educational needs
](/en/education/special-education-needs/special-education/) ranges from
additional support in mainstream schools to specialist support in special
schools. A student with a disability may be enrolled in a:

  * Mainstream class with additional support 
  * Special class in a mainstream school 
  * Special school 

##  Further and adult education

After post-primary school many students move on to further education or third
level (see third-level education below). The [ National Framework of
Qualifications (NFQ) ](https://www.qqi.ie/what-we-do/the-qualifications-
system/national-framework-of-qualifications) has 10 levels of education and
allows you to compare the different standards and levels of education
available to you across the education system.

###  Educational Training Board programmes

The [ Education and Training Boards (ETBs) ](https://www.etbi.ie/) run a range
of adult and further education and training programmes nationwide including [
Post-Leaving Certificate (PLC) courses ](/en/education/further-education-and-
training/post-leaving-certificate-courses/) . PLCs offer technical and
practical education as well as a route to higher and third-level education.

Other programmes offered through ETBs include the [ Vocational Training
Opportunities Scheme ](/en/education/further-education-and-
training/vocational-training-opportunities-scheme/) (second-chance education
for adults); [ Youthreach ](/en/education/further-education-and-
training/youthreach/) for early school-leavers; other literacy and basic
education; and self-funded evening adult programmes.

###  Apprenticeships

Apprenticeships provide on-the-job training and off-the job education. [
Apprenticeships ](/en/education/further-education-and-
training/apprenticeships/) are offered in traditional craft trades such as
plumbing and electrical engineering but also new apprenticeships such as ICT,
finance, software development and hospitality.

You must be at least 16 years of age and may need a minimum grade in [ Junior
Cycle ](/en/education/primary-and-post-primary-education/going-to-post-
primary-school/junior-cycle/) or equivalent exam.

###  Springboard+

[ Springboard+ ](/en/education/third-level-education/applying-to-
college/springboard/) provides free higher education courses for people who
are unemployed (or were self-employed) and those looking to return to the
workforce.

If you are working, you may have to pay a contribution towards course fees.
Generally, courses are part-time for one year and offered at Level 6 to 9 on
the NFQ. Courses offered include ICT, medical technologies, cybersecurity and
sustainable energy.

##  Third-level education

[ Third-level education ](/en/education/third-level-education/) is made up of
a number of sectors that are substantially funded by the State.

  * University sector 
  * Technological sector 
  * Colleges of education 

Universities in general are autonomous and self-governing. They offer degree
programmes at bachelor, masters and doctorate level.

The technological sector includes [ technological universities (TUs)
](https://www.gov.ie/en/press-release/69b0f-minister-harris-officially-opens-
new-atlantic-technological-university/) and institutes of technology (ITs)
which provide programmes of education and training in areas such as business,
science, engineering, linguistics and music to certificate, diploma and degree
levels.

The [ colleges of education ](http://www.teachingcouncil.ie/teacher-
education/initial-teacher-education-ite.191.html) specialise in training for
primary school teachers. Training for post-primary teachers is provided by
many third-level institutions. Qualifax provides detailed information on [
programmes for teacher training
](http://www.qualifax.ie/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=614&Itemid=201)
.

In December 2022, the Government announced plans to develop joint further and
higher education degree programmes. From September 2023, students may start
some degree programmes in further education and progress to higher education.
