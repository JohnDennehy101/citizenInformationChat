##  What is fostering?

Fostering means taking care of someone else's child in your own home.
Sometimes a child cannot live with their own family, either on a short-term or
long-term basis. This could be because of illness in the family, the death of
a parent, neglect, abuse or violence in the home. Sometimes it can be because
the parent or family is not coping. It is always the goal that a child placed
in foster care will return to their own family as soon as they can, if
possible. Young people up to the age of 18 can be fostered.

Foster care in Ireland is governed by the [ Child Care Act 1991
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1991/en/act/pub/0017/index.html) and the [
Child Care (Placement of Children in Foster Care) Regulations 1995, as amended
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1995/en/si/0260.html) . In addition, the [
National Standards for Foster Care, 2003 (pdf) ](http://health.gov.ie/wp-
content/uploads/2014/03/natstan1.pdf) ensure that foster care placements are
adequately supported and that children in foster care are receiving the best
possible care.

In June 2022, 89% of children and young people in the care of the State were
living with foster carers. Of the 5,219 children in foster care, 61.9% (3,230)
were in general foster care, 28.8% (1,504) were in relative foster care while
the remaining 9.3% (485) were placed with non-statutory fostering agencies
(private).

###  **Budget 2024 - Foster Care Allowance**

In November 2024, the Foster Care Allowance for children under 12 will
increase to €400 per week, and the Foster Care Allowance for children aged 12
and over will increase to €425 per week.

Foster children will be able to avail of the Group B Capital Acquisitions Tax
threshold based on their relationship to their foster parents. Legislation is
required to commence this change - the details are expected to be published in
the Finance Bill 2024.

##  The role of Tusla

[ Tusla, the Child and Family Agency ](/en/birth-family-
relationships/services-and-supports-for-children/tusla-the-child-and-family-
agency/) , assesses, recruits and trains foster families according to the
needs of the area. Tusla also places children with foster families who have
been recruited and trained by non-statutory agencies. Tusla is a non-statutory
agency responsible for each child in care. Tusla may also provide support to
the foster family.

Each foster child has their own social worker who monitors the growth and
development of the child, and ensures that the best interests of the child are
always the priority. Each foster family also has its own social worker, who
may have helped assess the family as suitable to foster children and who will
support the family throughout the foster term. An important part of the social
worker's role is to develop the relationship between the foster child and the
foster family and between the foster child and their own family.

Fostering a child differs from adoption because a child in foster care always
remains a permanent part of their own family. Tusla is responsible for the
child and the foster parents do not have [ guardianship ](/en/birth-family-
relationships/cohabiting-couples/guardianship-and-cohabiting-couples/) .

##  Placing a child in foster care

Children can be placed in foster care in 2 ways:

  * Voluntarily: When a parent or family asks Tusla for help, and/or 
  * Court order: When a judge decides that it is in the best interests of the child to be placed in the care of Tusla. 

When a child is placed in foster care, Tusla assigns responsibility for the
child to a social worker. Based on the child's needs and circumstances, Tusla
makes a decision on the type of fostering that is most suitable for the child.

##  Types of foster care

There are several types of foster care that can be provided by general or
relative foster carers, such as short-term and long-term care. Foster care can
also include emergency, day, respite, private, high support or other forms of
foster care.

###  Relative foster care

Relative foster care is when a person such as a family member, family friend
or neighbour becomes the foster parent of the child. Normally, a relative
foster carer is a person with whom the child or the child’s family has had a
relationship prior to the child’s admission to care. A relative foster carer
is assessed by Tusla in the same way as all other foster parents.

In making a decision about a relative becoming foster parent to the child,
Tusla will consider what is in the best interest of the child. Assessment will
also take into account the needs of the child and the abilities and
suitability of the relative foster carer to be a foster parent.

At the end of June 2022, nearly 29% of children in care were living with a
relative foster carer.

###  General foster care

When Tusla cannot find a suitable relative, or person known to the child, to
provide relative care, they place a child in general foster care. A general
foster carer has:

  * Been approved by Tusla 
  * Completed a process of assessment 
  * Been placed on the panel of approved foster carers to care for children in care 

Many of the children living in foster care have been with their foster
families for most of their lives. Others have shorter placements.

At the end of June 2022, almost 62% of children in care were in general foster
care.

###  Day foster care

This involves specially trained foster parents providing foster care for a
child on a daily basis. The child is not separated from their family, as they
go home each evening, yet benefit from the additional care offered in the
foster home. This type of care gives the child's own family an opportunity to
deal with difficulties each day as they arise. The aim of day foster care is
that the child can return home on a full-time basis.

###  Short-term foster care

This involves a child being cared for by a foster family for a short period
(ranging from 1 week to some months). The aim is for the child to return to
their family full-time at the end of the short-term period. Sometimes,
however, the child may remain in foster care on a longer-term basis.

###  Long-term foster care

Long-term foster care involves a child being cared for by a foster family for
a number of years and may continue until the child reaches adulthood.

If foster parents, including relative foster parents, have been caring for a
child for a continuous period of at least 5 years, they may apply to the court
for an order. The order may, subject to conditions, give the foster parents
broadly the same rights as parents to make decisions about their children. For
example, they will be able to give consent for medical and psychiatric
examinations, treatment and assessments, and apply for a passport. The foster
parents must get consent from Tusla, and may also need the consent of the
parents or guardians. This is set out under Section 4 of the [ Child Care
(Amendment) Act 2007.
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2007/en/act/pub/0026/index.html)

After a period of time, if it becomes clear that it will not be possible for
the child to be returned to their birth parents or family, it may be decided
that the child’s best interests would be served by being [ adopted by the
foster parents ](https://www.tusla.ie/services/birth-information-and-tracing-
and-adoption/what-is-adoption/) .

##  The foster child and their own family

When a child is placed in foster care on a daily, short-term or longer-term
basis, maintaining links with his or her own family is very important. The
child's own parents are involved as much as possible and are always kept fully
informed of how the child is getting on. The child will see their own family
as much as possible and even though they may live (even for a longer-term
period) with another family, the child's identity and name is their own.

##  Who can become a foster carer?

In June 2022, there were nearly 4,000 foster carers on the panel of approved
foster carers in Ireland. Any person or family can apply to Tusla to be
assessed as a foster parent or foster family. Foster carers are a diverse
group and may be single, married, in a same-sex relationship, employed,
unemployed, renting, retired, or have a disability. They may also be from
different cultures, ethnic or religious backgrounds.

A foster carer must be able to provide adequate and appropriate accommodation
for the foster child. Tusla assigns a social worker to carry out an assessment
of suitability. These assessments include meeting all members of the family
(particularly the foster parents) over a number of months. References, Garda
vetting and a willingness to attend training and ongoing learning support will
also be required as part of this process. Find out more about [ what is
required to become a foster carer at tusla.ie
](https://www.tusla.ie/services/alternative-care/foster-care/can-i-
foster-2019/) .

##  Allowances

Tusla pays a basic maintenance allowance to foster parents and families. The
agency also offers support structures to assist the child, carer and family
during the fostering term, including:

  * Training for the foster carer or family 
  * Ongoing liaison with social workers 
  * Insurance 
  * A medical card for the child in care 

From 1 January 2024, the Foster Care Allowance payable for children in foster
care placements is as follows:

Age of child  |  Weekly rate   
---|---  
Under 12 years  |  €350 per child   
12 years and over  |  €377 per child   
  
An allowance may be paid between the ages of 18 and 21 to young people leaving
care who are still in training or education. In certain circumstances, support
may continue for a further 2 years if the person is on a clear education or
training pathway.

This allowance is known as a Standardised Aftercare Allowance. A range of
other supports is available to all young people leaving care, whether they are
in education or not. You can find more information on [ Financial Support in
Aftercare (pdf)
](https://www.tusla.ie/uploads/content/4254-TUSLA_Finance_Aftercare_v3.pdf) on
the Tusla website.

Foster care allowances from Tusla are not taken into account in the [ means
test for social welfare payments ](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-
system/means-test-for-social-welfare-payments/cash-income-not-included-in-the-
social-welfare-means-test/) and are not taxable. An [ Increase for a Child
Dependant ](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/claiming-a-social-
welfare-payment/claiming-and-increase-in-your-payment-for-a-child-dependant/)
may also be payable.

###  **Budget 2024 - Foster Care Allowance**

In November 2024, the Foster Care Allowance for children under 12 will
increase to €400 per week, and the Foster Care Allowance for children aged 12
and over will increase to €425 per week.

Foster children will be able to avail of the Group B Capital Acquisitions Tax
threshold based on their relationship to their foster parents. Legislation is
required to commence this change - the details are expected to be published in
the Finance Bill 2024.

###  Child Benefit

When a child has been placed in foster care by Tusla, [ Child Benefit
](/en/social-welfare/families-and-children/child-benefit/) may continue to be
paid to the child's mother or father for a period of 6 months from the date of
the child's placement. Payment may then transfer to the foster parent(s)
provided that the child has been in their continuous care for a period of 6
months.
