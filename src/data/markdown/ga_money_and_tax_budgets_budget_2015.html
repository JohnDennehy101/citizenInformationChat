##  Introduction

**For information on the budget announced on Tuesday, 13 October 2015, please
visit our document on[ Budget 2016 ](/ga/money-and-tax/budgets/budget-2016/) .
**

Budget 2015 was announced on 14 October 2014.

The main Budget changes that may affect people living in Ireland are set out
below.

This document sets out changes in the areas of taxation, social welfare,
health, housing, education, employment and other areas. It is an overview and
not a complete statement of the measures announced in Budget 2015.

**This document will be updated throughout the week as more details become
available.**

Some of the changes announced in the Budget come into effect immediately.
Others take effect from the beginning of January 2015 or in mid-2015. Many
others have to be finalised before coming into effect.

Some elements of these measures may change when the legislation required to
bring them into effect is enacted.

For a full list of the Budget changes, please see the Department of Finance
website, [ budget.gov.ie ](http://www.budget.gov.ie) . You can find a summary
of the social welfare changes on the Department of Social Protection's
website, [ welfare.ie ](http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/Budget-2015.aspx) .

##  Taxation

###  Income tax

From January 2015 the **standard rate tax band** will increase by €1,000: from
€32,800 to €33,800 for single people and from €41,800 to €42,800 for married
couples with one income. The higher rate of income tax will reduce from 41% to
40%.

The threshold for exempt income under the **rent-a-room scheme** is being
increased to €12,000 per annum in 2015.

From 2015 **tax relief on water charges** at the standard rate of 20% will be
available, up to a maximum of €500 per annum (which means a maximum €100 tax
credit). This relief will be paid in arrears.

The **Home Renovation Incentive** is being extended to include renovation and
improvement of rental properties owned by landlords who pay income tax.

The threshold for the **artists’ exemption** will be increased by €10,000 to
€50,000 in 2015. The exemption is also being extended to non-resident artists
(to people who are resident or ordinarily resident in another EEA State).

The **Seed Capital Scheme** is being rebranded as "Start-Up Relief for
Entrepreneurs" (SURE) and being extended to people who have been unemployed
for up to 2 years.

###  Universal Social Charge (USC)

Incomes of €12,012 or less will be exempt from USC. Once your income is over
this limit, you pay the relevant rate of USC on all of your income.

Proposed standard rate of USC (2015)  **Rate** |  **Income band**  
---|---  
1.5%  |  Up to €12,012.00   
3.5%  |  From €12,012.01 to €17,576.00   
7%  |  From €17,576.01 to €70,044.00   
8%  |  From €70,044.01 to €100,000.00   
8%  |  Any PAYE income over €100,000   
11%  |  Self-employed income over €100,000   
Proposed reduced rate of USC (2015)  **Rate** |  **Income band**  
---|---  
1.5%  |  Income up to €12,012.00   
3.5%  |  All income over €12,012.00   
  
Reduced rates of USC apply to:

  * People aged 70 or over whose aggregate income for the year is €60,000 or less 
  * Medical card holders under 70 whose aggregate income for the year is €60,000 or less 

'Aggregate' income for USC purposes does not include payments from the
Department of Social Protection.

###  Deposit Income Retention Tax (DIRT)

A relief from DIRT on savings used by first time house buyers towards the
deposit on a home is being introduced.

###  Valued Added Tax (VAT)

The 9% rate of VAT is being retained for tourism-related activities.

From 1 January 2015, cross-border EU telecommunications, broadcasting and
electronically supplied services will be charged to VAT in the Member State of
the consumer and not the supplier. As a net recipient of these services, it is
estimated that Ireland will gain VAT revenues of €100m in 2015, rising to
€150m in 2019.

###  Excise Duties

The excise duty on a **packet of 20 cigarettes** is being increased by 40 cent
(including VAT) with a pro-rata increase on the other tobacco products, with
effect from midnight on 14 October 2014.

The excise duty on **roll-your-own tobacco** is being increased by an
additional 20 cent (including VAT) per 25g pouch with effect from midnight on
14 October 2014.

The enactment of the Betting (Amendment) Bill 2013 will allow for the
extension of **Betting Duty** to remote operators and betting exchanges in
2015.

The **Vehicle Registration Tax (VRT)** reliefs available for the purchase of
hybrid electric vehicles, plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, plug-in electric
vehicles, and electric motorcycles are being extended to 31 December 2016.

The special relief reducing the standard rate of Alcohol Products Tax by 50%
on **beers produced in microbreweries** which produce not more than 20,000
hectolitres per year is being extended to apply to microbreweries which
produce not more than 30,000 hectolitres per year.

A 30 day deferral of **excise duty on mineral oil** is provided for. To allow
for Revenue to revise the collection system, this measure will be subject to a
commencement order. This has an Exchequer cash-flow cost but does not impact
general government deficit.

The excise rate for **Natural Gas and BioGas as a propellant** will be set at
the current EU Minimum rate and this rate will be held for a period of 8
years.

###  Capital Gains Tax

The **property purchase incentive relief** from CGT (for the first 7 years of
ownership) for properties purchased between 7 December 2011 and 31 December
2014 is not being extended beyond 31 December 2014. Where property purchased
in this period is held for seven years the gains accrued in that period will
not attract CGT.

**Windfall tax provisions** introduced in 2009 which apply an 80% rate of tax
to certain profits or gains from land disposals or land development, where
those profits or gains are attributable to a relevant planning decision by a
planning authority, are being abolished from 1 January 2015\.

###  Corporation Tax

The 25% **R &D tax credit ** applies to the amount of qualifying R&D
expenditure incurred by a company in a given year that is in excess of the
amount spent in 2003. This 2003 base year restriction is now being removed
from 1 January 2015.

The current restrictions on **capital allowances for the provision of
specified intangible assets** will be removed.

The **accelerated capital allowances for energy efficient equipment** were due
to expire at the end of 2014. Following a review by the Department of
Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, this measure is being extended
to the end of 2017.

###  Agri-Taxation Review / Farming Measures

**Income tax** measures for farmers include:

  * Increase the amounts of income exempted from long term leasing by 50% and introduce a 4th threshold for lease periods of 15 or more years with income of up to €40,000 being exempted 
  * Allow relief where the lessee is a company 
  * Remove the 40 years of age threshold for leasing relief 
  * Allow income averaging where there is on-farm diversification 
  * Increase income averaging from 3 to 5 years 

The **VAT flat-rate scheme** compensates unregistered farmers for VAT incurred
on their farming inputs. The flat-rate addition will be increased from 5% to
5.2% from 1 January 2015. The flat-rate addition is reviewed annually in
accordance with the EU VAT Directive and the increase to 5.2% in 2015
continues to achieve full compensation for farmers.

**Farm restructuring CGT relief** is available where the first transaction in
the restructuring (e.g. sale, purchase or exchange of land) is carried out by
31 December 2015 with the restructuring to be completed within 24 months. The
deadline for the completion of the first restructuring transaction is being
extended to 31 December 2016.

Teagasc certification guidelines are being amended to enable whole farm
replacement to be eligible for the farm restructuring relief subject to
meeting the conditions laid down by Teagasc.

**CGT retirement relief** is being amended so that, subject to other
conditions, land that has been leased for up to 25 years in total (increased
from 15) ending with disposal will qualify for the relief.

Amendments to CGT retirement relief are also being made to provide (in the
case of land disposals outside the family) that land currently let under
conacre arrangements which end with disposal on or before 31 December 2016 or
which (before 31 December 2016) is instead leased out for minimum periods of 5
years to a maximum of 25 years ending with disposal will, subject to other
conditions, also qualify for CGT retirement relief.

Changes are being introduced to target **CAT agricultural relief** to active
farmers. From 1 January 2015, and subject to other conditions, the relief will
be available only in respect of agricultural property gifted to or inherited
by active farmers and to people who are not active farmers but who lease out
the property on a long-term basis for agricultural use to such farmers.

Agricultural leases of between 5 and 35 years in duration to active farmers
will be exempt from **stamp duty** .

**Consanguinity relief** , which applies to transfers of non-residential
property to certain relatives, is due to expire on 31 December 2014\. This
relief, which halves the applicable rate of stamp duty, will be extended for a
period of 3 years in certain circumstances where the transferor is 65 years or
under and the transferee is an active farmer.

##  Social Welfare

Total social welfare expenditure in 2015 will be €19.415 billion. There are no
changes to the rates of primary weekly social welfare payments and pensions.

###  Return to work supports

The Department of Social Protection will spend over €1.1 billion on employee
and employer supports in 2015. A Low Pay Commission will be established in
2015.

####  Back to Work Family Dividend

A new Back to Work Family Dividend will be introduced for lone parent and
long-term jobseeker families with children who find or return to work from
January 2015.

This will also apply to lone parent and long-term jobseeker families with
children who start or return to self-employment.

The Qualified Child Increase of €29.80 per week will be paid in full for the
first year in employment and half that amount will be paid weekly for the
second year. This amounts to €1,550 per child in Year 1 and €775 in Year 2\.

The Back to Work Family Dividend will be paid in addition to any entitlement
the family may have under the Family Income Supplement (FIS) scheme and will
not affect the level of the FIS payment.

####  JobsPlus

There will be a doubling of JobsPlus places from 3,000 to 6,000 to incentivise
employers to hire long-term unemployed people from the Live Register.
Employers can receive up to €10,000 in monthly cash grants over 2 years for
each eligible employee.

A new JobsPlus strand for young people will be launched in 2015 under the
Youth Guarantee.

####  JobPath

€12 million will be provided for the new employment activation programme
JobPath.

###  Payments to families and children

An extra €2 million will be provided for the Department of Social Protection’s
School Meals Programme in 2015. This funding will be used to increase funding
to existing DEIS schools. Over €349 million will be provided for Family Income
Supplement (FIS) in 2015.

The rate of **Child Benefit** will increase by €5 to €135 per month for each
child from January 2015. It is proposed that it will increase by a further €5
in 2016. This will cost €1.97 billion in 2015 and will benefit 613,000
families.

Child Benefit  **Number of Children** |  2014 Monthly Rate €  |  2015 Monthly Rate €  |  2015 Annual rate €  |  Yearly Increase from 2014 €   
---|---|---|---|---  
1 child  |  130.00  |  135.00  |  1,620.00  |  60.00   
**2 children** |  260.00  |  270.00  |  3,240.00  |  120.00   
**3 children** |  390.00  |  405.00  |  4,860.00  |  180.00   
**4 children** |  520.00  |  540.00  |  6,480.00  |  240.00   
**5 children** |  650.00  |  675.00  |  8,100.00  |  300.00   
**6 children** |  780.00  |  810.00  |  9,720.00  |  360.00   
  
Families with twins receive one and a half times the normal monthly rate for
each child. Families with multiple births receive Child Benefit at double the
normal monthly rate for each child.

###  Older people and people with disabilities

There are no changes to **pensions** and the **Free Travel Scheme** is
unchanged.

The **Living Alone Allowance** , paid to older people who live alone will be
increased by €1.30 to €9.00 per week from January 2015. This will cost €12
million and will benefit 177,500 people in 2015.

###  Water supports

A **Water Support payment** of €100 annually (€25 per quarter) will be paid to
pensioners, people with disabilities and carers who qualify for a Household
Benefits Package. This measure will cost €42 million and will benefit 415,000
households in 2015.

An additional €100 per annum will be paid to all **Fuel Allowance recipients**
who do not already get the Household Benefits Package. Fuel Allowance is paid
to people getting long-term payments such as Jobseeker’s Allowance (over 15
months) and One-Parent Family Payment. This will cost €24 million and will
benefit 238,000 households in 2015.

###  Christmas Bonus

A Christmas Bonus of 25% will be paid this December to people getting a long-
term social welfare payment (minimum payment of €20) to help with costs over
this period. This will benefit over 1.16 million people at a cost of €63.5
million.

The Christmas Bonus will be paid to people getting the following: State
pensions, Invalidity Pension, Widow’s/Widower’s/Surviving Civil Partner
pensions, Guardian’s payments, One-Parent Family Payment, Deserted Wife’s
Benefit, Carer’s Allowance, Pre-Retirement Allowance, Disability Allowance,
Farm Assist, long-term Jobseeker’s Allowance, Back to Work Allowance,
