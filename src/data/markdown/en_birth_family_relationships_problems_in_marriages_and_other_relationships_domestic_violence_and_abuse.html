##  What is domestic abuse?

If a partner or an ex makes you feel scared, controlled or intimidated, you
may be experiencing domestic abuse. There are many different forms of abuse.
It can be physical or it can be emotional, and it may have impacts that can or
cannot be seen by other people.

Abuse can happen to anyone at any age and in any type of relationship. It can
happen to adults and it can happen to teenagers. You don't have to be married
or living with your partner for them to act abusively towards you.

##  Types of abuse

An abusive relationship is where one person uses abuse to control and have
power over their partner in an intimate relationship. Types of abuse include:

  * Physical abuse 
  * Emotional abuse 
  * Online abuse 
  * Sexual abuse 
  * Economic (financial) abuse 
  * Digital abuse 

Coercive control is another type of abusive behaviour. This is when a
boyfriend or girlfriend, partner, husband or wife, or ex uses an ongoing
pattern of controlling, coercive and threatening behaviours to trap the person
in a relationship. A person experiencing coercive control may also change
their routines and lose contact with family and friends. Coercive control can
make it impossible or even dangerous to leave an abusive relationship.

##  What are my options?

Recognising that you are being abused is an important step. You may feel you
need time to think about your situation. Or perhaps you have already made up
your mind to end the relationship or to leave. Whatever you decide, your
safety (and that of your children if there are children) is always the
priority.

###  Domestic violence court orders

If you are being subjected to abuse by a current or former partner, you can
get legal protection through the courts. The main kinds of protection
available are [ safety, protection and barring orders
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/birth-family-relationships/problems-
in-marriages-and-other-relationships/barring-safety-and-protection-orders/) .

###  Domestic violence leave

From 27 November 2023, you have a legal right to 5 days of paid [ domestic
violence leave ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/employment/employment-
rights-and-conditions/leave-and-holidays/domestic-violence-leave/) , if you
need to take time off work because of domestic violence and abuse. This could
be for medical visits, legal proceedings, counselling, looking for other
accommodation or accessing domestic violence services. The leave can be taken
where you are directly experiencing domestic violence and abuse, or where you
are supporting a ‘relevant person’. A ‘relevant person’ can be your:

  * Spouse or civil partner 
  * Someone you live with 
  * Someone you are in an intimate relationship with 
  * Child who is under 18 
  * Another dependent person 

##  Are you concerned about someone you know?

You can take some basic steps to help and support a friend, family member,
colleague, neighbour or anyone who confides in you that they are experiencing
domestic abuse. You can offer emotional support and you can offer practical
support.

**Emotional support**

  * Listen, try to understand and be careful not to blame them. Nothing they do or say can justify the abuser's behaviour. 
  * Tell them they are not alone and that there are supports available if they need them. 
  * Support them as a friend. Encourage them to express their feelings, whatever they are. 
  * Don't tell them to leave the relationship if they are not ready to do this. This is their decision. 

**Practical support**

  * Tell them about the support services available (see ‘Support organisations and services’ below). 
  * Give them mobile phone credit if they need it so they can make calls in case of emergency. 
  * Ask if they have suffered physical harm. If so, offer to go with them to a hospital or to see their GP. Suggest that it might be useful in future to have records of any injuries as abuse frequently escalates over time. 
  * Help them to report the assault to the police if they want to. 
  * Go with them to visit a solicitor if they are ready to take this step. 
  * Agree a code word with them which they can use if they are in danger and need help. 
  * Offer the use of your address and/or telephone number to leave information and messages, and tell them you can look after an emergency bag for them, if they want that. 
  * Give them a small amount of money to put away in case they need to get a taxi or bus in an emergency to leave the house and go to family or a refuge. 

Remember to look after yourself while you are supporting someone through such
a difficult and emotional time. Ensure that you do not put yourself into a
dangerous situation; for example, do not offer to talk to the abuser about
their behaviour or let yourself be seen by the abuser as a threat to their
relationship.
