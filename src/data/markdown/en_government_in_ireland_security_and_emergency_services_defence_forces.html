The 3 services of the Permanent Defence Forces are:

The army is the largest service in the Defence Forces. It organises and trains
ground forces and air defence units to carry out all roles assigned by the
Government. There are two brigades or subdivisions of the army, one based in
Cork and the other in Dublin. There is also a training centre based in the
Curragh Camp, Kildare.

###  Air Corps

The air corps is the air component of the Defence Forces and is based at
Casement Aerodrome, Dublin. It organises and trains airborne command and
control units. The primary role of the air corps is to support the army in
maintaining the security of the State. It is also responsible for the
Ministerial Air Transport Service which provides air transport for the
President and Government.

###  Naval Service

The naval service, or navy, protects the State at and from the sea. It is
based on Haulbowline Island in Cork. Among its duties are to defend the
State’s territorial seas, conduct maritime surveillance and provide a
specialist diving team.

##  Reserve Defence Force

in crisis situations. In non-crisis situations it trains to carry out this
duty. It is made up of 3 services:
