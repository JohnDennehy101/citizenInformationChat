##  Introduction

If you are planning on retiring to Ireland, this page can help you with some
of the practical steps involved. You will also find links to further
information available on citizensinformation.ie and other websites.

If you are an Irish citizen, you can read about [ returning home to Ireland to
retire ](/en/returning-to-ireland/retiring-to-ireland/retiring-to-ireland-as-
a-returning-irish-emigrant/) .

##  Do I have the right to move to Ireland?

Not everyone has the right to come and live in Ireland. Your right to reside
here depends on your nationality and your particular situation.

###  Nationals who can enter and live in Ireland with no restrictions

Irish citizens and UK citizens can enter Ireland and live here without any
conditions. But if you have family who are citizens of other countries and
want to join you here, you may have to show that they can support themselves
or that you can support them.

You can read more about [ Residence rights of UK citizens ](/en/government-in-
ireland/ireland-and-the-uk/residence-rules-UK-citizens/) and [ Retiring to
Ireland as a returning Irish emigrant ](/en/returning-to-ireland/retiring-to-
ireland/retiring-to-ireland-as-a-returning-irish-emigrant/) .

###  Nationals who can enter Ireland freely, but must meet set conditions to
live here.

In most cases, EEA (this includes the EU and Norway, Iceland and Lichtenstein)
and Swiss nationals and their families can enter Ireland and remain for up to
3 months without restriction.

If you are retired and plan to stay more than 3 months, you must have
sufficient resources and sickness insurance to ensure that you do not become a
burden on the Irish State, or you must be employed or self-employed.

EEA and Swiss nationals do not have to make a formal application to live in
Ireland, but if you have family who are not citizens of the EEA or
Switzerland, [ they will have to apply for residence.

ireland/rights-of-residence-in-ireland/residence-rights-eu-national/)

Immigration Service Delivery has information for [ non-EEA citizens retiring
to Ireland ](https://www.irishimmigration.ie/coming-to-live-in-ireland/i-want-
to-retire-to-ireland/) .

###  Nationals who need permission to enter and live in Ireland

Citizens of certain non-EEA countries [ must apply for an entry visa
](/en/moving-country/visas-for-ireland/visa-requirements-for-entering-
ireland/) before they travel to Ireland. You can [ find out if you need a visa
to enter Ireland ](/en/moving-country/visas-for-ireland/visa-requirements-for-
entering-ireland/) . If you want to come to Ireland to live, you have to apply
for a long stay visa (category D visa). You have to show that you have enough
money to support yourself in Ireland.

When you have arrived in Ireland, you have to [ apply for a Stamp 0
](https://www.irishimmigration.ie/registering-your-immigration-
permission/information-on-registering/immigration-permission-stamps/#stamp-
categories) immigration permission. This permission can given to people who
have:

  * Income of at least €50,000 per year (If you are part of a couple, then your joint income should be €100,000 per year). 
  * Access to a lump sum of money to cover any sudden expenses. This lump sum should cover the cost of a house or an apartment in Ireland. 

If you are coming to join your child or children in Ireland and they plan to
support you, you can read about [ how much income your child or children
should have(pdf) ](https://www.irishimmigration.ie/wp-
content/uploads/2021/04/Policy-document-on-Non-EEA-family-reunification.pdf)
in chapter 18 of the Irish Immigration Services Division's Family
Reunification Policy Document.

##  What do I need to know before I retire to Ireland?

If you are an Irish citizen, [ read information on returning home to Ireland
to retire ](/en/returning-to-ireland/retiring-to-ireland/retiring-to-ireland-
as-a-returning-irish-emigrant/) .

###  Housing

You may find that [ housing ](/en/moving-country/moving-to-
ireland/introduction-to-the-irish-system/accommodation/) is expensive in
Ireland. If you want to [ buy a home in Ireland ](/en/housing/owning-a-
home/buying-a-home/) you need to be aware of the prices, the process by which
houses are bought and sold and the initial costs that are involved. There are
no restrictions on the purchase or rent of residential property or land. [
Rented accommodation ](/en/housing/renting-a-home/looking-for-a-flat-or-house-
to-rent/) comes in many forms including houses, flats and apartments.

###  Health services

If you are [ ordinarily resident in Ireland
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/health/health-system/entitlement-to-
public-health-services/#094550) , you are entitled to a range of health
services that are either free of charge or subsidised by the Irish Government.
You can read more about [ entitlement to public health services
](/en/health/health-system/entitlement-to-public-health-services/) . Depending
on your income, you may be eligible for a [ medical card ](/en/health/medical-
cards-and-gp-visit-cards/medical-card/) which entitles you to certain health
services at no cost. [ GP Visit Cards ](/en/health/medical-cards-and-gp-visit-
cards/gp-visit-cards/) entitle you to free GP Visits.

In addition to the public health system, people in Ireland can avail of a
range of private health care services. You must pay the full costs of
treatment if you opt for private health care. There are a number of [ private
health insurance ](/en/health/health-system/private-health-insurance/)
companies in Ireland. If you are ordinarily resident in Ireland, you are
entitled to the same benefits from your private health insurance as any other
Irish citizen.

###  Social security entitlements

If you are thinking of coming here to retire, you can read about the [ social
security system in Ireland ](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-
system/social-welfare-system-in-ireland/) . You can also read about

  * [ Moving to Ireland and your social security entitlements ](/en/moving-country/moving-to-ireland/introduction-to-the-irish-system/moving-to-ireland-and-your-social-security-entitlements/)
  * [ Residency requirements for social assistance payments ](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/social-assistance-payments/habitual-residence-condition/)

###  Pensions

Most long-term contributory pensions such as old age or widowed pensions can
be paid in any country so you can have your pension from another country paid
in Ireland. You can read more about [ pensions in Ireland. ](/en/money-and-
tax/personal-finance/pensions/)

If you have worked in more than one [ EEA country
](https://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?catId=1115&langId=en&intPageId=4614) or
in a country with which Ireland has a [ Bilateral Social Security Agreement
](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/dc7910-guidelines-on-application-of-
bilateral-agreements/) then your periods of insurance can be combined with
Irish insurance to see if you would qualify for a pension from each country.
If you are getting a pension under EU Regulations or a Bilateral Agreement you
may be eligible for the [ Household Benefits Package ](/en/social-
welfare/extra-social-welfare-benefits/household-benefits-package/) .

tax/tax/moving-country-and-taxation/tax-residence-and-domicile-in-ireland/) .

###  Working in retirement

Some retired people may only have retired from one occupation. Retiring from
work therefore may simply signal a career change. Not everyone has an
automatic right to work in Ireland - so check in advance whether you require
permission to [ work in Ireland ](/en/moving-country/working-in-ireland/) .

Most legislation dealing with the protection of employees in Ireland does not
have an upper age limit. This means that if you are [ working in retirement
](/en/employment/retirement/older-people-and-working/working-in-retirement/) ,
then you have the same employment rights as everyone else. If you decide to
work part-time, you can find out about [ employment rights of part-time
workers. ](/en/employment/types-of-employment/rights-of-part-time-workers/)

###  Driving, cars and transport

Full driving licences from all other EU member states (and some other
countries) are recognised for use in Ireland. You may be able to [ convert
your driving licence to an Irish one ](/en/travel-and-
recreation/motoring/driver-licensing/exchanging-foreign-driving-permit/) . If
you want to bring your car to Ireland you need to know about [ importing a car
](/en/moving-country/moving-to-ireland/coming-to-live-in-ireland/importing-
car-into-ireland/) and implications for Vehicle Registration Tax (VRT).

If you are aged over 66 and living permanently in Ireland you are entitled to
[ free travel on public bus and rail transport ](/en/social-welfare/extra-
social-welfare-benefits/free-travel/) .

##  Further information

There are strict regulations about [ importing pets from abroad ](/en/moving-
country/moving-to-ireland/coming-to-live-in-ireland/bringing-pets-to-ireland/)
and there are [ customs regulations about the importation of prohibited or
restricted goods ](/en/travel-and-recreation/travel-to-ireland/customs-
regulations-for-travellers/) .

Irish citizens living in Ireland have the right to vote in all elections and
referenda. If you are living in Ireland but are not an Irish citizen you may [
vote in some elections ](/en/government-in-ireland/elections-and-
referenda/voting/right-to-vote/) . You can read about the [ political system
at national level ](/en/moving-country/moving-to-ireland/introduction-to-the-
irish-system/political-system/) and [ the political system at local level
](/en/government-in-ireland/how-government-works/local-and-regional-

work/active-retirement/) promote education and leisure activities for retired
people.
