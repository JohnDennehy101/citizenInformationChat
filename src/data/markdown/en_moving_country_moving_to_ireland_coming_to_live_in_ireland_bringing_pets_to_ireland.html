#  Bringing pets to Ireland

  * Introduction 
  * Special rules for travellers from Ukraine and EU citizens travelling from Russia 
  * Cats, dogs and ferrets – EU travel 
  * Cats, dogs and ferrets – Non EU travel 
  * Pet birds, rabbits and rodents 
  * Non-compliant pets

##  Introduction

The importation of pets into Ireland is strictly controlled to ensure that
diseases such as rabies are not introduced. The EU system of Passports for
Pets allows cats, dogs and ferrets to travel between EU member states and some
other countries that are part of the scheme.

The information in this document is about bringing a pet to Ireland, and is
not about buying a pet abroad, or bringing animals into Ireland for [
commercial purposes ](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/ffadc-commercial-dog-
cat-or-ferret-movements/) .

For EU rules to apply, you must travel to Ireland with your pet.

If you are bringing a cat, dog or ferret from outside the EU (including the UK
but not including Northern Ireland), you should follow the rules set out in
‘Cats, dogs and ferrets – non EU travel’ below.

##  Special rules for travellers from Ukraine and EU citizens travelling from
Russia

From 21 November 2022, if you bring your pet to Ireland, you must comply with
all the requirements for pets entering Ireland from outside the EU/EEA.

If your pet is not fully complaint, it will be put in quarantine. You must pay
for the quarantine.

You can read about the [ current arrangements in Ukrainian and Russian
](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/21d40-pet-travel/#special-arrangements-
for-ukraine-and-eu-citizens-in-russia) .

##  Cats, dogs and ferrets – EU travel

If you are coming to Ireland from another EU country you should follow the
steps below to bring your cat, dog (including guide dogs) or ferret with you
to Ireland. These rules also apply to pets travelling from:

  * Andorra 
  * Gibraltar 
  * Greenland 
  * Faroe Islands 
  * Iceland 
  * Lichtenstein 
  * Monaco 
  * Northern Ireland 
  * Norway 
  * San Marino 
  * Switzerland 
  * Vatican City State 

Different rules apply if you are:

  * Buying a cat, dog or ferret abroad and having it shipped to Ireland 
  * Shipping your cat, dog or ferret back to Ireland unaccompanied 
  * Travelling to Ireland to [ sell a cat, dog or ferret ](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/ffadc-commercial-dog-cat-or-ferret-movements/)
  * Travelling with more than 5 pets 
  * [ Bringing your pet unaccompanied ](https://www.gov.ie/en/service/28ae66-pet-travel/#bringing-an-unaccompanied-pet-cat-dog-or-ferret-into-ireland)
  * Travelling from outside the EU or from a country not listed above (see ‘Coming from outside the EU’ below) 

[ Detailed information ](http://www.pettravel.gov.ie/) about these situations
is on the Government's Pet Travel Portal.

The law governing the importation of cats, dogs and ferrets for non-commercial
purposes is the [ Pet Travel (Cats, Dogs and Ferrets) Regulations 2020
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2020/si/141/made/en/print) .

###  Step 1 – Microchipping

Your cat, dog or ferret must be microchipped before it is vaccinated against
rabies. The microchip must be readable by a device compatible with ISO
standard 11785\. If you or your vet is unsure about the specifications of the
microchip, you should contact the microchip manufacturer. Alternatively, you
can carry your own microchip reader with you which can be used on your pet.

###  Step 2 – Vaccination

Your pet must be vaccinated against rabies. The vaccine must be given after
the microchip is inserted.

Your pet must be at least 12 weeks old when it is vaccinated. You must wait
until the appropriate immunity has developed before you can bring the dog, cat
or ferret to Ireland. This is the time as stated on the datasheet of the
vaccination given, and must be at least 21 days after the primary vaccination
is given.

The waiting period does not apply to booster vaccinations, provided they are
given BEFORE the date the previous rabies vaccine has run out.

###  Step 3 – the pet passport

You need an EU pet passport issued by an EU country or one of the countries
listed above, to enter Ireland. The pet passport must be stamped by a vet to
show that the rabies vaccination has been given.

###  Step 4 – Tapeworm treatment

If you are bringing a dog into Ireland, it must be treated for tapeworm
(Echinococcus multilocularis) each time you travel to Ireland, unless you are
travelling from Northern Ireland, Finland, Malta or Norway. The treatment must
be given by a vet between 1 and 5 days before you arrive in Ireland, and
recorded in the pet passport.

##  Cats, dogs and ferrets – Non EU travel

**Note** : If you travel from Britain (not including Northern Ireland) with
your pet after 1 January 2021, non EU rules apply. You must follow the
following process even if your pet is returning to Ireland from Britain and
was born and raised in Ireland. The rules for travelling from Northern Ireland
have not changed.

If your pet does not have an EU pet passport (GB pet passports are no longer
allowed, but NI pet passports are), you must have a health certificate issued
by UK authorities. You can read more about [ travelling from Britain
](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/b76e9-brexit-movement-of-pets/) .

###  Step 1 – Microchipping

Your cat, dog or ferret must be microchipped before it is vaccinated against
rabies. The microchip must be readable by a device compatible with ISO
standard 11785\. If you or your vet is unsure about the specifications of the
microchip, you should contact the microchip manufacturer. Alternatively, you
can carry your own microchip reader with you which can be used on your pet.

###  Step 2 – Vaccination

Your pet must be vaccinated against rabies. The vaccine must be given after
the microchip is inserted.

Your pet must be at least 12 weeks old when it is vaccinated. You must wait
until the appropriate immunity has developed before you can bring the dog, cat
or ferret to Ireland. This is the time as stated on the datasheet of the
vaccination given, and must be at least 21 days after the primary vaccination
is given.

The waiting period does not apply to booster vaccinations, provided they are
given BEFORE the date the previous rabies vaccine has run out.

###  Step 3 – EU pet passport, or EU health certificate

If you have an EU pet passport the pet passport must be stamped by a vet
registered in the EU to show that the rabies vaccination has been given. This
is useful for Irish pets who are returning from holidays in a non-EU country.

If your cat, dog or ferret does not have a valid pet passport, you must get an
[ EU Health Certificate
](https://www.gov.ie/pdf/?file=https://assets.gov.ie/99187/f3fe5fe0-c6ed-46c8-9c52-2c7b9b6f3945.pdf#page=1)
signed and stamped by an official government veterinarian in the country you
are travelling from..

After being checked and stamped on arrival into the EU, this Certificate is
valid for 4 months, or until the anti-rabies vaccination expires – whichever
is the earliest.

###  Step 4 – Blood test

Your cat, dog or ferret must get a blood test called a Rabies serological
test, if they are from a country or territory that is not a [ listed country
or territory ](http://www.pettravel.gov.ie/) . If your country is **not**
listed in the drop down menu on the Pet Travel portal, your pet needs a rabies
blood test.

You must wait at least 30 days from the rabies vaccination before your pet
gets its blood tested. The sample must be sent to an EU approved laboratory.

The blood test must show that the vaccination was successful. If it is
successful, you must wait a further 3 months from the taking of the blood
sample before travelling to Ireland.

If your pet is starting it’s journey in the EU, (e.g. Ireland to Brazil and
back again), you do not have to wait 3 months in Brazil if the blood sample
was taken by a vet in the EU or one of the following countries, and entered
into an EU pet passport or EU health certificate **before** leaving Ireland:

  * Andorra 
  * Gibraltar 
  * Greenland 
  * Faroe Islands 
  * Iceland 
  * Lichtenstein 
  * Monaco 
  * Northern Ireland 
  * Norway 
  * San Marino 
  * Switzerland 
  * Vatican City State 

You must bring the original test certificate, or a copy received from the lab,
with you when you come to Ireland.

If the blood test is taken in a non-EU country, the three month waiting period
will always apply.

###  Step 5 – Tapeworm treatment

If you are bringing a dog into Ireland from a non-EU country, it must be
treated for tapeworm (Echinococcus multilocularis) each time you travel to
Ireland. The treatment must be given by a vet between 1 and 5 days before you
come to arrive in Ireland, and recorded in the pet passport or EU health
certificate.

###  Step 6 – Advance notice

You must tell the Irish port or airport authorities at least 24 hours before
your arrival, but ideally in the week or so before travel. You must only enter
Ireland at the following ports and airports. [ Advance notice
](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/e454d-advance-notice/) should be emailed
to:

  * **Dublin Airport** \- [ petmove@agriculture.gov.ie ](mailto:petmove@agriculture.gov.ie)
  * **Dublin Port** \- [ Dubport.petmove@agriculture.gov.ie ](mailto:Dubport.petmove@agriculture.gov.ie)
  * **Shannon Airport** \- [ PetsShannon@agriculture.gov.ie ](mailto:PetsShannon@agriculture.gov.ie)
  * **Cork Airport** \- [ corkpetmove@agriculture.gov.ie ](mailto:corkpetmove@agriculture.gov.ie)
  * **Ringaskiddy Port, Cork** \- [ corkpetmove@agriculture.gov.ie ](mailto:corkpetmove@agriculture.gov.ie)
  * **Rosslare Europort** \- [ rosslare.europort@agriculture.gov.ie ](mailto:rosslare.europort@agriculture.gov.ie)

###  Step 7 – Compliance check

Your pet must undergo a compliance check on arrival into Ireland from a non-EU
country. This is arranged using the email addresses above.

If your pet is travelling to another EU country first and you have a check
there, then your pet does not need another check on entry into Ireland. If
however, you entered another EU country and were unable to arrange a check to
be carried out there, you must arrange a compliance check on arrival into
Ireland.  

##  Pet birds, rabbits and rodents

If you are moving to live in Ireland or coming here on holiday, you may be
able to bring your pet bird, rabbit or rodent with you, provided you meet
certain requirements. There is more information about the [ entry requirements
for birds, rabbits and rodents either from EU or from outside the EU
](http://www.pettravel.gov.ie/) on the Government's Pet Travel Portal.

If you are bringing a pet bird, rabbit or rodent to Ireland from another EU
state you must accompany the pet to Ireland. At least 24 hours before you
arrive in Ireland you must send a completed advance notice of importation into
Ireland form to the Animal Health Division, Department of Agriculture, Food
and the Marine at the address below. Owners of pet birds must also travel with
a completed [ Owner Declaration for Pet Birds
](https://www.gov.ie/en/form/fd433-owner-declaration-pet-birds-eu/) form.

If you wish to [ bring a pet bird, rabbit or rodent from a country outside the
EU ](http://www.pettravel.gov.ie/) , please see DAFM's guidance, and make sure
you have enough time to allow the pre-export requirements, which include a
veterinary health certificate, testing, or quarantine requirements to be
completed.

[ Forms and notices ](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/b3e83-import-into-
ireland-of-pet-birds-forms-of-advance-notice-and-accompanying-declaration/)
are available on the DAFM website.

##  Non-compliant pets

If your pet does not meet the entry requirements, it may be refused entry into
Ireland. The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine may return your
pet to the country you travelled from.

Alternatively DAFM may place your pet into quarantine to be tested or
microchipped and vaccinated to comply with EU requirements. Your pet will
remain in quarantine until it fully complies with EU Legislation. In very
limited circumstances, your pet may be euthanised. You will have to pay to
cover the cost of these measures, including quarantine if necessary.
