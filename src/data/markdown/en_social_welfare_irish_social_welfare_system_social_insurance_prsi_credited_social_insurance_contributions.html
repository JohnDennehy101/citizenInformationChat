##  Introduction

If you are working, your employer pays a [ Pay Related Social Insurance (PRSI)
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-
system/social-insurance-prsi/social-insurance/) contribution to the Social
Insurance Fund for you each week. Depending on how much you earn, your
employer may also deduct PRSI from your wages. These PRSI contributions can
help you to qualify for social insurance payments, such as [ Jobseeker's
Benefit ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/social-welfare-
payments/unemployed-people/jobseekers-benefit/) and the [ State Pension
(Contributory) ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/social-
welfare-payments/older-and-retired-people/state-pension-contributory/) .

If you are not working, the Department of Social Protection can give you a
weekly _credited social insurance contribution_ , but you must meet certain
conditions to qualify. Credited contributions can be used with your PRSI
contributions to help you qualify for a [ social insurance payment
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-
system/social-insurance-prsi/social-insurance/) .

PRSI contributions are sometimes called ‘paid contributions’. Credited
contributions are also called 'credits’.

**Record of your contributions**

Your PRSI and credited contributions are recorded on your social insurance
record by the Department of Social Protection. You can request your record of
contributions, known as a ‘Contribution Statement’ on [ MyWelfare.ie
](https://services.mywelfare.ie/en/topics/statements-refunds-and-
repayments/contribution-statement/) .

**Voluntary contributions**

Some people can also choose to pay [ voluntary contributions
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-
system/social-insurance-prsi/voluntary-prsi-contributions/) , which are
different to credited contributions.

##  How to qualify for credited contributions

To qualify for a credited contribution _,_ you usually must meet the following
conditions.

You must have worked and have at least one paid PRSI contribution at any of
the following PRSI classes:

  * A 
  * B 
  * C 
  * D 
  * E 
  * H 
  * P 

You must have paid or credited contributions in either of the last 2 completed
tax years. For example, if you are applying for credits in 2023, you must have
paid or credited contributions in either 2022 or 2021.

If it's been more than 2 completed tax years since you had contributions,
you'll need to work and pay PRSI for a further 26 weeks before you qualify for
credited contributions.

The rules for getting credited contributions are set out in [ SI No. 312 of
1996 ](https://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1996/si/312/made/en/print) .

**Rate of credited contribution**

Credited contributions are usually given at the same rate as your last paid
PRSI contribution. This means your credit can only help you qualify for the
social insurance payments paid to your PRSI class.

For example, if your last paid PRSI contribution was Class A your credits will
also be for Class A. If it was for Class B, your credits will be for Class B.

Find out about [ the social welfare payments for each PRSI Class
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-
system/social-insurance-prsi/social-insurance-classes/) .

##  Types of credits you can get

###  Credits during unemployment

You get credits automatically if you are fully unemployed and getting
Jobseeker's Benefit. You can continue to get credits if you have used up your
entitlement to Jobseeker's Benefit and qualify for Jobseeker's Allowance.

You do not automatically get credits if you are getting Jobseeker's Allowance.
You must have paid or credited contributions in either of the last 2 tax years
to get credits with Jobseeker's Allowance.

If you are unemployed and don’t qualify for a jobseeker’s payment, you can
still sign on for credits, if you meet the qualifying conditions.

####  **Signing on for credits**

You can sign on for credits, if you don’t qualify for a jobseeker’s payment or
you are a qualified adult on your spouse's, civil partner's or cohabitant's
social welfare payment and meet the qualifying conditions.

To sign on for unemployment credits, you must have paid or credited
contributions in either of the last 2 tax years and be:

  * Unemployed 
  * Available and capable of work 
  * Genuinely seeking work 

If you are **on strike from work,** you can sign on for credits.

You must sign on for credits in your Intreo centre or social welfare local
office - see 'Where to apply' below.

####  **Training credits**

If you are unemployed and getting credits, you can continue to get credits if
you take part in the following schemes:

  * The [ Back to Education Allowance Scheme (BTEA) ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/social-welfare-payments/back-to-education/back-to-education-allowance/)
  * The [ Vocational Training Opportunities Scheme (VTOS) ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/education/returning-to-education/vocational-training-opportunities-scheme/)

You can get credits if you take part in an approved training course under the
following organisations:

  * SOLAS 
  * Certain [ Education and Training Boards (ETB’s) ](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/99f84f-operational-guidelines-prsi-credited-social-insurance-contributions/#appendix-1-schedule-2-education-and-training-boards-act-2013)
  * National Tourism Development Authority 
  * Teagasc 
  * Bord Iascaigh Mhara (BIM) 

The Department of Social Protection provides information on [ training
programmes where you can continue to get credits
](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/99f84f-operational-guidelines-prsi-
credited-social-insurance-contributions/#qualifying-conditions-in-detail) .

If you qualify for the BTEA Scheme after signing on for credits, you do not
get a weekly Back to Education Allowance.

####  **Credits and benefit payment for 65 year olds**

If you are getting the [ benefit payment for people aged 65
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/older-and-retired-
people/payment-for-people-retired-at-65/) , you will get credits if you are
entitled to credits when the claim starts.

If you transfer from [ Jobseeker’s Benefit
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/unemployed-
people/jobseekers-benefit/) to the benefit payment for people aged 65, you
should qualify for credits.

However, if you transfer from [ Jobseeker’s Benefit (Self-Employed) (JBSE)
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/unemployed-
people/jobseekers-benefit-self-employed/) to the benefit payment for people
aged 65, you won’t get credits unless you met the conditions for credits on
your JBSE claim.

###  Pre-entry credits when you start work

When you start work you are automatically given _pre-entry credits_ . These
credits are normally given once. They cover you from the beginning of the tax
year in which you start work, up to the actual date you start work. The
credits also cover you for the 2 previous income tax years.

Your pre-entry credits can help you to qualify for the following social
insurance payments:

  * [ Illness Benefit ](/en/social-welfare/disability-and-illness/illness-benefit/)
  * [ Jobseeker's Benefit ](/en/social-welfare/unemployed-people/jobseekers-benefit/)
  * [ Treatment Benefit ](/en/social-welfare/disability-and-illness/treatment-benefit-scheme/)
  * [ Maternity Benefit ](/en/social-welfare/families-and-children/maternity-benefit/)
  * [ Paternity Benefit ](/en/social-welfare/families-and-children/paternity-benefit/)
  * [ Parent's Benefit ](/en/social-welfare/families-and-children/parents-benefit/)
  * [ Adoptive Benefit ](/en/social-welfare/families-and-children/adoptive-benefit/)
  * [ Health and Safety Benefit ](/en/social-welfare/families-and-children/health-safety-benefit/)

Pre-entry credits can also help you qualify for the [ State Pension
(Contributory) ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/social-
welfare-payments/older-and-retired-people/state-pension-contributory/) .
However, the credits will only cover you from the beginning of the tax year in
which you start to work up to the actual date you start work.

Pre-entry credits are not given at Class B, C, D, J and S.

###  Credits during illness

You can get credits if you are getting [ Illness Benefit
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/social-welfare-
payments/disability-and-illness/disability-benefit/) , [ Injury Benefit
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/social-welfare-
payments/disability-and-illness/injury-benefit/) and [ Invalidity Pension
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/social-welfare-
payments/disability-and-illness/invalidity-pension/) .

If you use up your entitlement to Illness Benefit or Injury Benefit, you
should continue to submit medical certificates to continue to get credits.

If you have applied for Illness Benefit or Injury Benefit and don't qualify
because you do not meet the PRSI requirements, you may still be entitled to
credits if you have paid or credited contributions in the last 2 tax years.
You must submit medical certificates to get credits.

You can continue to get credits during illness if you take part in the [ Back
to Education Allowance Scheme ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-
welfare/social-welfare-payments/back-to-education/back-to-education-
allowance/) .

####  Disability allowance

You can get credits while on [ Disability Allowance
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/social-welfare-
payments/disability-and-illness/disability-allowance/) , if you have paid or
credited contributions in the last 2 years. If you are getting Disability
Allowance because you have used up your entitlement to Illness Benefit, you
will get credits.

####  Public servants

[ Public servants who give up work because of ill health
](http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/PRSI---Credited-Social-Insurance-
Contributions.aspx) can protect their entitlement to certain payments by
sending in medical certificates once a year.

###  Credits for carers

If you give up work to care for someone and get [ Carer's Allowance
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/social-welfare-
payments/carers/carers-allowance/) or [ Carer's Benefit
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/social-welfare-
payments/carers/carers-benefit/) , you will be automatically awarded credits.

If you take unpaid statutory [ carer's leave
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/employment/employment-rights-and-
conditions/leave-and-holidays/carers-leave/) from work and do not get Carer’s
Allowance or Benefit, you can still be awarded credits for up to 104 weeks.
Your employer must complete an [ application for carer's leave 'credits'
](https://www.gov.ie/en/form/46769-application-form-carers-leave-credits/)
when you return to work.

**Carer’s Leave Credits**

People who take Carer’s Leave (temporary unpaid leave from work to care for
someone) but do not get Carer’s Benefit or Carer’s Allowance qualify for
Carer’s Leave credits for each week of Carer’s Leave up to a maximum of 104
weeks. The person should ask their employer to complete the application form
for Carer’s Leave credits on their return to work.

###  Credits and homemakers

The [ Homemaker's Scheme ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-
welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/social-insurance-prsi/homemakers-scheme/)
can make it easier for homemakers to qualify for a State Pension
(Contributory). Under the Scheme, up to 20 years of caring for a [ qualified
child or adult ](https://www.gov.ie/en/service/e216c5-homemakers-scheme/#what-
the-homemakers-scheme-is) can be disregarded when working out your yearly
average contributions for a state pension.

The Scheme only covers complete years. If you are a homemaker for part of a
year either at the start or the end of your homemaking period, you may get
credited contributions.

###  Student credits

Student credits are only given once and cover periods when you are in full-
time education.

To qualify, you must have:

  * Worked and paid PRSI Class A before starting your course 
  * Started your course before you reached 23 years 
  * Started before you took up full-time insurable employment 

You apply for student credits when you apply for a social insurance payment.
Student Credits can be used to help you qualify for short-term payments only
(for example, Illness Benefit and Jobseeker's Benefit). You provide written
confirmation from the school or college that you were a student there, and the
dates you attended.

###  Credits for different types of leave

You will automatically be awarded _credits_ when you are getting Maternity
Benefit, Paternity Benefit, Adoptive Benefit, Parent's Benefit or Health and
Safety Benefit.

If you take [ unpaid statutory maternity leave
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/employment/employment-rights-and-
conditions/leave-and-holidays/maternity-leave/) , your employer must complete
an [ application for maternity leave credits (pdf)
](https://assets.gov.ie/70415/a8216143d57b441fa4068a1ba107685b.pdf) when you
return to work.

If you take [ unpaid statutory adoptive leave
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/employment/employment-rights-and-
conditions/leave-and-holidays/adoptive-leave/) , your employer must complete
an [ application for adoptive leave credits (pdf)
](https://assets.gov.ie/96970/18854bdf-34b6-49c2-8784-fe29e6a1a737.pdf) when
you return to work.

If you take [ parental leave
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/employment/employment-rights-and-
conditions/leave-and-holidays/parental-leave/) , your employer must [ contact
the Department of Social Protection
](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/80e5ab-prsi-pay-related-social-
insurance/#prsi-for-employers) with the number of weeks and dates of your
parental leave, so that you can get credits for this time.

###  Volunteer development worker's credits

You can get [ Volunteer development worker's credits
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/moving-country/moving-abroad/working-
abroad/voluntary-development-work-abroad-and-social-insurance/) for the time
you spend as a volunteer development worker abroad, up to a maximum of 5
years.

###  Change of status credits

You may qualify for change of status credits, if you are employed at PRSI
Class A and your last paid PRSI contribution was at Class B, C or D. These
change of status credits are only taken into account for the State Pension
(Contributory).

You can get change of status credits back to the beginning of the tax year in
which you start making PRSI contributions at the Class A rate and for the
previous tax year. A mixture of PRSI contributions at Class A and PRSI
contributions at Class B, C or D may help you to qualify for a mixed insurance
pro-rata State Pension (Contributory).
