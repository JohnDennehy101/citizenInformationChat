##  Who needs a short-stay visa for Ireland?

If you plan to visit Ireland, you should [ check if you need a visa
](/en/moving-country/visas-for-ireland/visa-requirements-for-entering-
ireland/) .

This page has information on how to apply for a short-stay visa. This is also
called a ‘C’ visa and is usually valid for up to 90 days from the issue date
of the visa. You apply for a C visa if you plan to come to Ireland:

  * For tourism 
  * To visit family or friends 
  * To get married 
  * For medical treatment 
  * For short-term study 

If you are not a citizen of the EU, EEA, Switzerland or UK and you do not need
a visa to come to Ireland, you still need to have documents with you to show
the reason for your visit. You must present yourself at immigration when you
enter Ireland.

Having a visa does not guarantee that you will be allowed to [ enter Ireland
](/en/moving-country/visas-for-ireland/permission-to-land-in-ireland/) .

##  How to apply for a short-stay visa

You apply for a visa online. You complete a separate application for each
person travelling, including children. After you have submitted the visa form,
you have 30 days to send the supporting documents. It’s a good idea to prepare
your documents before completing the form.

You pay a fee of €60 for each application. A multiple entry visa costs €100.

When you have submitted the form, you will get a summary of your application.
This includes:

  * Your visa application transaction number 
  * Your application summary sheet 
  * Details of the application office where you should send your documents 

You send the signed summary sheet with your documents.

##  Documents to send for a short-stay visa

You must send documents in support of your application. This section has
information on the main documents you need to send. You can get [ more
information about documentation ](https://www.irishimmigration.ie/coming-to-
visit-ireland/how-to-apply-for-a-short-stay-c-visit-tourist-visa/) on the
Irish Immigration Delivery website.

You must send original documents (not photocopies). If your documents are not
in English, you must send a [ certified translation
](https://www.irishimmigration.ie/how-to-make-a-certified-translation-of-a-
document/) and the original document.

Birth, marriage and death certificates will be returned to you. If you want
other pages returned to you, you should include a note with your application
that says this. Send a photocopy (in addition to the original) of the page you
want returned to you.

If your visa is approved, you must get travel insurance before you travel to
Ireland.

###  Letter of application

You must write a letter that explains why you want to come to Ireland. You
should give the details of your trip, including the dates you plan to be here,
where you will stay and how you will pay for things while you are here.

You must say in your letter that you will:

  * Obey the conditions of your visa in full 
  * Leave Ireland before your visa expires 
  * Not rely on public services or become a burden on the State 

If you are visiting friends or family your letter should also have:

  * Their names and addresses 
  * The names and addresses of any of your family who live in Ireland or another country in the EEA or Switzerland, even if you do not plan to visit them 

###  Letter of invitation

If you are visiting someone in Ireland, you should send a letter of invitation
written by them. The letter should have information about how they know you,
the dates you are visiting them and why they are inviting you to Ireland.

They should include a colour copy of their passport or national identity card.
If they are from outside the EEA, Switzerland and UK, they must include a copy
of their Irish Resident Permit and the current immigration stamp in their
passport.

The letter must also say that they understand you must:

  * Obey the conditions of your visa in full 
  * Leave Ireland before your visa expires 
  * Not rely on public services or become a burden on the State 

###  Information about where you will stay

You must include the details of where you will stay. You should include
printouts of your booking confirmations. If you are staying with friends,
family or colleagues, see ‘letter of invitation’ above.

###  Passport

You must send your current passport. It must be valid for at least 6 months
after the date you plan to leave Ireland. You must also send a photocopy of
each page of all of your previous passports.

###  Proof of finances

You must show that you have the money you need for your trip. If someone else
is paying for your visit (for example a family member), you should send
documents to show that they can afford to pay for you.

You don’t need to have a particular or set amount of money to qualify for a
short-stay visa.

###  Passport photos

Include 2 passport photos. You must sign your name and put your visa
application transaction number on the back of each photo.

###  Show that you must return home

You must show that you have strong ties to your home country and that you must
return home. This could be family responsibilities, work, education or
something else. You should send proof of these responsibilities. For example,
if you are working you should send a letter from your employer and recent
payslips.

You can read [ more details of the documents you need
](https://www.irishimmigration.ie/coming-to-visit-ireland/how-to-apply-for-a-
short-stay-c-visit-tourist-visa/) on the Immigration Service Delivery website.

##  Decisions and appeals

If you sent your application to Dublin, you can check [ visa decisions and
waiting times ](https://www.irishimmigration.ie/visa-decisions/) . If you sent
your application somewhere else, you can contact the embassy or consulate you
sent your documents to for updates on your application. Applications take
around 8 weeks, but may take longer.

If your visa application is successful, the visa office will post your
passport back to you with the visa attached. The visa will be valid for a
particular period. Having a visa does not guarantee that you will be allowed
to [ enter Ireland ](/en/moving-country/visas-for-ireland/permission-to-land-
in-ireland/) .

###  Refusals

You will get a letter that says why your visa application was refused. You can
appeal this decision within 2 months.

##  Can I stay longer than 3 months?

You are expected to leave the State on or before the date which has been
stamped on your passport by the Immigration Officer when you entered.

You can only extend your visa if there is an [ unexpected change in your
circumstances ](https://www.irishimmigration.ie/extension-of-visitor-
permission/) since you entered Ireland.

You cannot get an extension if:

  * There is no change in circumstances from the time you entered Ireland 
  * There is no change in circumstances from the time you were granted a travel visa 
  * You are in Ireland to seek medical attention 
  * You are seeking a permission to marry in Ireland 
  * You are in Ireland to provide childcare facilities 
  * You wish to live in Ireland full time 

##  Visa fees

Some people [ do not have to pay the visa fee
](https://www.irishimmigration.ie/preclearance-and-entry-visas-fees/) .

A visa costs:

**Single-journey visa** : €60

**Multiple-journey visa** : €100
