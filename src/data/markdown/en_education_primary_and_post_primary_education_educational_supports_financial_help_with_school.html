##  Free schoolbooks

###  **Free primary schoolbooks**

Since September 2023, parents of children in primary school and special
schools do not have to pay for [ schoolbooks, workbooks and copybooks (pdf)
](https://www.gov.ie/pdf/?file=https://assets.gov.ie/250812/c0e12161-a64b-4dce-88d8-c7e6a6ed4a68.pdf#page=null)
.

The school provides the free books on loan. You must return the books at the
end of the school year, or if your child leaves the school. You should make
sure the books are kept in good condition so they can be re-used.

If you must buy additional items for your child, the school will let you know.

](https://assets.gov.ie/250686/b1aa4f60-a8d7-4a8c-8257-6f585bb87a10.pdf) .

###  **Post-primary schools**

####  **Free books for Junior Cycle students**

From September 2024, schools in the Free Education Scheme will provide free
schoolbooks and core classroom resources to all Junior Cycle students (those
in the first 3 years of post-primary school).

Core classroom resources include things like copybooks, journals, calculators
and dictionaries.

The school will provide the free books on loan. You must return the books at
the end of the school year, or if your child leaves the school. If you must
buy additional items for your child, the school will let you know. While the
scheme includes eBooks, it does not cover the purchase of digital devices.

If your child already started in first year of post-primary school, you may
already have their Junior Cycle books. If your child needs additional books
before starting second or third year in September 2024, the school will
provide them for free.

.

####  **Senior Cycle book rental scheme**

Post-primary schools in the Free Education Scheme can help Senior Cycle
students (those in Transition Year, fifth year, and sixth year) with the cost
of schoolbooks.

The scheme allows schools to support students from low-income families or
families experiencing financial hardship. Under the scheme, schools can
either:

  * Set up a book rental scheme within the school, or 
  * Help individual students buy books 

You must pay a small rental fee.

You can contact your child’s school to see if they have a book rental scheme.
If not, you can suggest it to the school principal. You can also read the [
Guide for Parents: Textbook rental schemes (pdf) ](https://s3-eu-
west-1.amazonaws.com/govieassets/39088/f6a23749787e4ee88d4fd0bcc1c8e62d.pdf) .

To apply for assistance under the scheme, contact the school principal. The
principal has full discretion in deciding which students are most in need.

##  Exam fees

**Note: There were no exam fees for students sitting the Junior Cycle or
Leaving Certificate exams in 2024.**

Ordinarily, students whose parent or guardian have a [ medical card
](/en/health/medical-cards-and-gp-visit-cards/medical-card/) do not have to
pay the examination fees for [ Junior Cycle
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/education/state-examinations/junior-
cycle-exam-and-results/#7652a5) or [ Leaving Certificate
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/education/state-
examinations/examination-fees/) . You put the details of the medical card on
the fee payment form and send it back to the school.

However, if you apply after the deadline, you will have to pay late fees even
if your parents have a medical card.

##  School transport

The school transport scheme provides transport for children who:

  * Live 3.2 km or more from their local primary school 
  * Live 4.8 km or more from their local post-primary school 

In general, you pay a fee for the scheme. However, school transport may be
free to medical card holders, if the school transport scheme is operating in
your area and your child is eligible.

####  **Remote Area Grant**

If a student qualifies for the school transport scheme but there is no
transport service available, a Remote Area Grant may be paid to contribute
towards private transport arrangements.

These grants may also be paid to students who live 3.2 km or more from the
nearest pick-up point for school transport.

](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/education/primary-and-post-primary-
education/going-to-primary-school/school-transport-for-children-with-special-
needs/) to and from special schools and classes. If transport cannot be
provided, you may be able to apply for a Special Transport Grant to help with
the cost of making private transport arrangements.

###  **Remote Area Boarding Grant**

The Remote Area Boarding Grant provides funding for students to get boarding
or lodging so they can attend a free second-level school.

  * Be unable to get a place in a suitable second-level school within 25km of where you live 
  * Be proposing to attend a second-level school that provides free education 

Students living on offshore islands which do not have a school providing
suitable free second-level education may also qualify.

The maximum grant available is €4,947 per year. This is paid to the school, or
to the parent or guardian, after each school term once the school has verified
the student’s attendance during the year. You may need to provide a statement
of the boarding or lodging fees paid.

Applications for children starting in September of each year should be
submitted before 30 April of that year. Applications received after this time
may not be processed by September. You cannot apply online.
