##  Introduction

If you get married, both you and your spouse continue to be treated as single
people for tax purposes in that year. If, however, the tax you pay as two
single people is greater than the tax that would be payable if you were taxed
as a married couple, you can claim the difference as a tax refund. Refunds are
only due from the date of marriage and will be calculated after the following
31 December. So, for example, if you get married in 2024, any tax refund due
to you will be calculated after 31 December 2024.

Refunds are normally only due where a couple are taxed at different rates and
one spouse could benefit from the unused standard rate cut-off point or for
some of the unused tax credits of the other spouse.

When you get married it is important to inform Revenue of the date of your
marriage. You can [ update your marital status with Revenue online
](https://www.revenue.ie/en/online-services/services/manage-your-
record/update-civil-status.aspx) .

##  Taxation of civil partners

Civil partners are entitled to the same rights as married couples in financial
matters such as tax, inheritance, property, pensions and maintenance if the
relationship breaks down. Some legal relationships between same sex couples
that are recognised by a foreign state (such as marriage, civil union, civil
partnership) are recognised by Revenue for taxation purposes. You can read [
further information about civil partnerships ](/en/birth-family-
relationships/civil-partnerships/civil-partnerships/) .

##  Rules

For the years following your marriage or civil partnership, there are three
options for taxation:

  * Assessment as a single person (you are both still taxed as single people) 
  * Separate assessment 
  * Joint assessment 

##  Assessment as a single person

Under assessment as a single person, also known as separate treatment, each
spouse or civil partner is treated as a single person for tax reasons. With
this option:

  * Both spouses or civil partners are taxed on their own income 
  * Both spouses or civil partners get tax credits and the same standard rate cut-off point due to a single person 
  * Both spouses or civil partners pay their own tax 
  * Both spouses or civil partners complete their own return of income form and claim their own tax credits. One spouse or civil partner cannot claim relief for payments made by the other. There is no right to transfer tax credits or standard rate cut-off point to each other. 

You can request separate treatment in [ myAccount
](https://www.ros.ie/myaccount-web/home.html) or by writing to Revenue. Either
spouse or civil partner can make the claim and the option remains until the
person who claims it changes their mind. If you want to claim assessment as a
single person, you must apply within the tax year (preferably at the start of
the year).

Choosing to be assessed as a single person when you are married or in a civil
partnership is unfavourable in some circumstances. This is mainly because you
cannot transfer any unused tax credits or standard rate cut-off point. You
cannot claim [ Home Carer's Tax Credit ](/en/money-and-tax/tax/income-tax-
credits-and-reliefs/home-carers-tax-credit/) if your spouse or civil partner
is caring for a dependent person and would otherwise qualify for the relief.

##  Separate assessment

Under the separate assessment option, the tax affairs of spouses or civil
partners are independent of each other. The difference between separate
assessment and assessment as a single person is that some tax credits are
divided equally between you under the separate assessment option. These tax
credits are:

  * [ Married or Civil Partner's Tax Credit ](https://www.revenue.ie/en/personal-tax-credits-reliefs-and-exemptions/marital-and-civil-status/personal-tax-credit/index.aspx)
  * [ Age Tax Credit ](https://www.revenue.ie/en/personal-tax-credits-reliefs-and-exemptions/health-and-age/age-tax-credit/index.aspx)
  * [ Blind Person's Tax Credit ](/en/money-and-tax/tax/tax-credits-and-reliefs-for-people-with-disabilities/tax-reliefs-for-people-with-a-visual-impairment/)
  * [ Incapacitated Child Tax Credit ](/en/money-and-tax/tax/tax-credits-and-reliefs-for-people-with-disabilities/incapacitated-child-tax-credit/) . 

The [ Employee Tax Credit ](http://www.revenue.ie/en/personal-tax-credits-
reliefs-and-exemptions/income-and-employment/employee-tax-credit/index.aspx)
(formerly known as the PAYE tax credit) and expenses (if any), are allocated
to the appropriate spouse/civil partner. Any tax credits other than the
Employee Tax Credit and employment expenses that are unused by one partner can
be claimed by the other spouse or civil partner. The tax credits are not
usually adjusted until after the end of the tax year.

Any tax credits that are unused (other than the Employee Tax Credit and
employment expenses) and the standard rate cut-off point up to €51,000 in 2024
(€49,000 in 2023) can be transferred to the other spouse or civil partner but
only at the end of the tax year. The increase in the standard rate tax band of
up to €33,000 in 2024 (€31,000 in 2023) is not transferable between partners.
If you think you have unused tax credits or standard rate cut-off point,
contact Revenue for a review after the end of the tax year. Overall, the
amount of the tax that is payable under this option (separate assessment) is
the same that is payable under the joint assessment option discussed below.

The claim for separate assessment must be made between 1 October of the
previous year and 31 March in the year you want separate assessment to apply.
Either spouse or civil partner can request this form of assessment, although
the other spouse or civil partner will have to confirm this request. Separate
assessment will then continue until you request to change it. These requests
can be made in [ myAccount ](https://www.ros.ie/myaccount-web/home.html) or by
writing to [ Revenue ](https://www.revenue.ie/en/contact-us/index.aspx) . Each
spouse or civil partner can complete a separate return of their own income.

##  Joint assessment

The joint assessment option is usually the most favourable basis of assessment
for a married couple or civil partners. This option is automatically given by
the tax office when you advise them of your marriage or civil partnership, but
this does not prevent you from choosing any of the options examined earlier.
Under this option, the tax credits and standard rate cut-off point can be
allocated between spouses to suit their own circumstances.

If only one spouse or civil partner has taxable income, all tax credits and
the standard rate cut-off point will be given to the spouse or civil partner
with the income.

If both of you have taxable income, you can decide which of you is to be the
assessable spouse or nominated civil partner. The assessable spouse or
nominated civil partner is responsible for filing tax returns and paying any
tax due. You can select the assessable person using [ myAccount
](https://www.ros.ie/myaccount-web/home.html) or by writing to Revenue before
31 March in the year you want the selection to apply. They continue to be the
assessable person unless you both decide to change that. If you do not make a
selection, the person with the higher income is the assessable person.

You then ask the tax office to allocate the tax credits and standard rate cut-
off point between you in whatever way you want. (The Employee Tax Credit,
employment expenses and the increase in standard rate cut-off point of €33,000
in 2024 are not transferable).

You will both receive updated Tax Credit Certificates showing the allocation
of your credits and rate band.

If Revenue does not get a request from you to allocate your tax credits in any
particular way, it will normally give all the tax credits (other than the
other partner's Employee and expense tax credits) to the spouse or civil
partner being assessed. The spouse or civil partner being assessed must
complete the return of income for the couple and is charged for tax on the
joint income of the couple.

If one spouse or civil partner is self-employed, joint assessment can still
apply. The flexibility this option brings can be convenient - especially if
one of you pays tax under the PAYE system and the other pays tax under the
self-assessment system. Under joint assessment, you let your circumstances
determine if most of the tax should be paid under PAYE or in a lump sum on
assessment. This is determined by the way in which the tax credits are
allocated. If you choose to pay most of your tax under PAYE, your credits can
be transferred to the self-employed person (but not employment expenses or the
Employee Tax Credit).

If a refund is due at the end of the year, it will be repaid to each person in
proportion to the amount of tax each has paid.

##  Rates

The [ standard rate cut-off point
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/money-and-tax/tax/income-tax/how-your-
tax-is-calculated/#0164f9) for married couples/civil partners is €51,000 in
2024. This amount is taxed at 20% and the balance is taxed at 40%. Where both
spouses/civil partners have income, this standard rate cut-off point can be
increased by the **lower** of the following:

  * €33,000 in 2024 **or**
  * The amount of the income of the spouse/civil partner with the smaller income. 

You cannot claim this increase as well as the [ Home Carer Tax Credit
](/en/money-and-tax/tax/income-tax-credits-and-reliefs/home-carers-tax-
credit/) . If you are eligible for both, [ contact your Revenue office
](https://revenue.ie/en/contact-us/index.aspx) to help you decide which would
be best for you.

In 2023, the standard rate cut-off point for married couples/civil partners
was €49,000, with a maximum increase of €31,000.

##  How to apply

**Joint** **assessment:** to nominate or change the assessable spouse, you
must contact Revenue by 31 March of the year you want the change to apply to.
Use [ myAccount ](https://www.ros.ie/myaccount-web/home.html) or send a letter
to [ Revenue ](https://www.revenue.ie/en/contact-us/index.aspx) signed by both
of you. You can also fill in an [ Assessable Spouse Election Form (pdf)
](http://www.revenue.ie/en/life-events-and-personal-
circumstances/documents/assessable-spouse-election-form.pdf) or [ Nominated
Civil Partner’s Election Form (pdf) ](https://www.revenue.ie/en/life-events-
and-personal-circumstances/documents/nominated-civil-partner-election-
form.pdf) and send it to Revenue by 31 March.

**Separate assessment:** to be assessed separately from your spouse, you must
contact Revenue between 1 October and 31 March. For example, to be assessed
separately in 2024, the claim must be made between 1 October 2023 and 31 March
2024. To request separate assessment, use [ myAccount
](https://www.ros.ie/myaccount-web/home.html) or write to [ Revenue
](https://www.revenue.ie/en/contact-us/index.aspx) .

Further information about the taxation of married people and civil partners,
with examples showing how income is taxed, is available on [ Revenue's website
](http://www.revenue.ie/en/life-events-and-personal-circumstances/marital-
status/marriage-and-civil-partnerships/index.aspx#) .
