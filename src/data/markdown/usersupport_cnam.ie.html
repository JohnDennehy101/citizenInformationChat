#  Enriching Ireland’s Media Landscape

Coimisiún na Meán is Ireland’s agency for developing and regulating a
thriving, diverse, creative, safe and trusted media landscape. This means
having a mix of different voices, opinions and sources of news. This means
protecting children and all of us from harmful content.

Our responsibilities are to:

  * Oversee the funding of and support the development of the wider media sector in Ireland. 
  * Oversee the regulation of broadcasting and video-on-demand services. 
  * Develop and enforce the Irish regulatory regime for online safety.
