##  What is adoptive leave?

If you are a parent who is adopting alone or as part of an adopting couple,
you can get 24 weeks’ leave off work with adoptive leave. Only one parent in
the couple can qualify for adoptive leave.

The 24 weeks start from the date the child is placed in your care.

Your employer does not have to pay you during adoptive leave, unless it is
included in your contract. You can get [ Adoptive Benefit ](/en/social-
welfare/families-and-children/adoptive-benefit/) , if you have enough PRSI
contributions.

You can take up to 16 additional weeks’ unpaid adoptive leave, but you cannot
claim Adoptive Benefit for these extra weeks.

You must give your employer 4 weeks’ notice **in writing** if you plan to take
adoptive leave – see ‘Applying for adoptive leave’ below.

###  **Before the adoption**

Before adopting a child, you may have to attend preparation classes and pre-
adoption meetings with social workers. You are entitled to paid time off work
for these classes and meetings.

##  Who can take adoptive leave?

_Qualifying adopters_ can take adoptive leave. A qualified adopter is either:

  * The sole adopter, in the case of a parent who is adopting a child on their own 
  * The _nominated parent_ in the case of an adopting couple 

The adopting couple can choose who should take the adoptive leave (they must
decide who will be the nominated parent).

An adopting couple means:

  * A married couple 
  * A couple who are civil partners 
  * A [ cohabiting couple ](/en/birth-family-relationships/cohabiting-couples/rights-of-cohabiting-couples/) adopting a child 

The parent who does not take adoptive leave is entitled to [ paternity leave
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/employment/employment-rights-and-
conditions/leave-and-holidays/paternity-leave/) .

##  Adoptive leave and pay

Your employer does not have to pay you while you are on adoptive leave unless
it is included in your contract.

###  **Adoptive Benefit**

If you have enough PRSI contributions, you can apply for [ Adoptive Benefit
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/social-welfare-
payments/social-welfare-payments-to-families-and-children/adoptive-benefit/) .
The Department of Social Protection will pay you Adoptive Benefit for the full
24 weeks if your adoptive leave begins on the date of adoption.

You cannot get Adoptive Benefit during the 16 weeks of additional adoptive
leave.

####  **Applying for Adoptive Benefit**

You should apply for Adoptive Benefit 6 weeks before you plan to go on
adoptive leave (or 12 weeks if you are self-employed).

###  **What happens to my PRSI contributions?**

While you are getting Adoptive Benefit, you will automatically get [ PRSI
credits ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/irish-social-
welfare-system/social-insurance-prsi/credited-social-insurance-contributions/)
.

To add more PRSI credits for the time spent on unpaid additional adoptive
leave, you must get your employer to complete an [ application form for
adoptive leave credits (pdf)
](https://assets.gov.ie/96970/18854bdf-34b6-49c2-8784-fe29e6a1a737.pdf) . You
do this after you return to work.

##  If you become sick

If you become sick while you are on adoptive leave, you can ask your employer
to end your additional adoptive leave and put you on [ sick leave
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/employment/employment-rights-and-
conditions/leave-and-holidays/sick-leave/) . You may then be able to get [
sick pay ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/employment/employment-rights-
and-conditions/leave-and-holidays/sick-leave/) or [ Illness Benefit
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/social-welfare-
payments/disability-and-illness/disability-benefit/) .

##  Applying for adoptive leave

You must give your employer **4 weeks’ notice** **in writing** that you plan
to take adoptive leave. The 4-week rule applies whether you are adopting a
child in Ireland or from another country. In your letter, tell your employer
the date when you expect to start your leave.

If you want to take the additional 16 weeks’ adoptive leave, you must also
give your employer at least 4 weeks’ written notice. You can give notice about
the adoptive leave and the additional adoptive leave at the same time.

If you do not give notice, you may lose your rights to adoptive leave.

###  **Certificate of placement**

You must give your employer a _certificate of placement_ confirming the
adoption. Do this within 4 weeks after the day of placement.

###  **Can I postpone adoptive leave?**

If your child has to stay in hospital or go into hospital before you have
taken your adoptive leave or additional leave, you can ask your employer to
postpone (or delay) the leave.

##  Other types of leave for adoptive parents

Various types of statutory leave are [ available for adoptive parents
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/employment/employment-rights-and-
conditions/leave-and-holidays/leave-for-parents/) . You may be entitled to:

  * [ Parental leave ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/employment/employment-rights-and-conditions/leave-and-holidays/parental-leave/) : Parents can take 26 weeks’ unpaid leave from work to look after their children aged under 12 
  * [ Paternity leave ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/employment/employment-rights-and-conditions/leave-and-holidays/paternity-leave/) : The parent who is not taking adoptive leave can take 2 weeks’ leave in the first 6 months after the baby is adopted 
  * [ Parent’s leave ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/employment/employment-rights-and-conditions/leave-and-holidays/parents-leave/) : Adoptive parents can take 9 weeks’ leave within 2 years of the placement of the child with the family 

###  **What happens to my annual leave?**

In general, you are treated as though you are in employment while you are on
adoptive leave and additional adoptive leave. This means you continue to build
up your right to [ annual leave
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/employment/employment-rights-and-
conditions/leave-and-holidays/annual-leave-public-holidays/) .

You are also entitled to leave for any [ public holidays
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/employment/employment-rights-and-
conditions/leave-and-holidays/public-holidays-in-ireland/#ea1d31) that take
place during your adoptive leave and additional adoptive leave.

##  Returning to work after adoptive leave

By law, you have the right to return to the same job with the same contract of
employment. If this would be too difficult for your employer to arrange, they
must provide suitable alternative work on terms that are not ‘less favourable’
than in your previous job.

You have the same rights to return to work as with [ maternity leave
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/employment/employment-rights-and-
conditions/leave-and-holidays/maternity-leave/) , and you must also give 4
weeks’ notice of your intention to return.

If the business where you work is sold while you are on adoptive leave or
additional adoptive leave, your rights on returning to work stay the same
under the new employer.

The law protects you against [ penalisation
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/employment/enforcement-and-
redress/victimisation-at-work/) and [ unfair dismissal
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/employment/unemployment-and-
redundancy/dismissal/unfair-dismissal/) . If you have a dispute with your
employer over adoptive rights, you can complain to the Workplace Relations
Commission – see below.

##  Making a complaint

If you have a complaint or dispute about adoptive leave, you can complain to
the Workplace Relations Commission within 6 months of the dispute or complaint
occurring.

The time limit may be extended for up to a further 6 months, but only where
you have a good reason for not making the complaint within the normal time
limit.

Use the [ online complaint
](https://www.workplacerelations.ie/en/Complaints_Disputes/Refer_a_Dispute_Make_a_Complaint/)
form on workplacerelations.ie.
