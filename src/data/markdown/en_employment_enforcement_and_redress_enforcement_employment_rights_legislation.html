##  Who enforces employment law?

Employment conditions are monitored by the [ Workplace Relations Commission
(WRC) ](/en/employment/enforcement-and-redress/workplace-relations-
commission/) to make sure employers are following employment-rights
legislation.

If you are an employer, you must make sure that your employment records are up
to date and are available for inspection, as required by law.

See the [ WRC’s guide to inspections (pdf)
](https://www.workplacerelations.ie/en/Publications_Forms/Employers_Guide_to_Inspections.pdf)
.

This page is written for employers dealing with WRC inspections.

##  Inspections by the Workplace Relations Commission

The WRC's Inspection Services are responsible for carrying out inspections in
workplaces.

###  Why is my business being inspected?

Inspections can happen for a number of reasons.

These include:

  * To investigate a specific complaint 
  * As part of random or targeted inspections in a particular sector of employment 
  * As part of routine inspections 

###  How will I know if I am due an inspection?

Usually, you will be told beforehand.

If there is a valid reason why the inspection cannot take place on the
proposed date, you must contact the inspector as soon as possible to arrange a
different date.

In certain situations, the inspector may also call without advance notice. For
example, unannounced out of hours inspections to ensure that [ young people
are not working outside the hours allowed ](/en/employment/starting-work-and-
changing-job/young-people-at-work/working-hours-rest-breaks-young-people/) .

If necessary, inspectors may be accompanied by other inspectors or the Gardaí.
They can also apply to the [ District Court ](/en/justice/courts-
system/district-court/) for search warrants.

###  What can inspectors do?

Inspectors have powers under the law.

Inspectors can:

  * Enter premises at reasonable times 
  * Interview employers and employees 
  * Take statements 
  * Examine and take copies of records 
  * Begin legal proceedings 

If an initial inspection of records finds that you have breached employment
law, the WRC Inspection Services have several options.

They can:

  * Issue a letter asking you to correct this 
  * Refer the matter to legal services for prosecution 
  * Carry out a further inspection 

Inspectors can work in Joint Investigation Units with both Revenue and the
Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection. They can also exchange
information with these bodies.

###  Breaches involving unpaid wages

In a case relating to an employee's unpaid wages, you may receive a letter
requesting evidence that you as the employer are complying with the law.

If you do not respond or your response is inadequate, the Inspection Services
will make a second inspection.

You will receive a warning that any further or new breaches discovered mean
you will be prosecuted.

Where breaches of the Protection of Young Persons (Employment) Act 1996 are
found these are referred for prosecution after a first inspection.

##  Enforcement and penalties

If the WRC find you in breach of employment legislation, they can:

  * Start to prosecute you 
  * Send you a compliance notice to fix the issue 
  * Fine you with a fixed payment notice 

We explain each below.

###  Prosecutions

The WRC can bring [ summary prosecutions ](/en/justice/criminal-law/criminal-
trial/disclosure-in-criminal-cases/) against employers accused of breaking the
law.

If you are convicted of an offence, you must pay the WRC the cost of expenses
to investigate, detect and prosecute the offence. This is the case unless the
court decide there are valid reasons why you do not have to cover these costs.

This is set out in the [ Workplace Relations Act 2015
](https://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2015/act/16/enacted/en/html) .

###  Compliance notices

If an inspector finds that you have breached employment legislation, you can
receive a [ compliance notice
](https://www.workplacerelations.ie/en/Complaints_Disputes/Inspections/Compliance_Notice/)
. The notice sets out how you should fix the issue. It is an offence not to
comply with a compliance notice.

You can appeal to the Labour Court against the compliance notice within 42
days. You may make a further appeal to the Labour Court if you are not
satisfied with the actions taken by the [ Circuit Court ](/en/justice/courts-
system/circuit-court/) .

If you receive a compliance notice or there is any other dispute about it, you
can still face other consequesnces on top of the compliance notice:

  * Employees can take action against you in relation to any alleged breach of employment law 
  * You can be prosecuted for an offence under employment laws 

Compliance notices may be used in relation to breaches of the legislation
listed in [ Schedule 4 of the Workplace Relations Act 2015
](https://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2015/act/16/schedule/4/enacted/en/html#sched4)
.

###  Fixed payment notices

The WRC can use fixed payment notices for certain offences.

Inspectors can issue [ fixed payment notices
](https://www.workplacerelations.ie/en/Complaints_Disputes/Inspections/Fixed_Payment_Notice/)
for up to €2,000 where they have reasonable cause to believe that a person has
committed a relevant offence. The fine must be paid within 42 days.

These offences are:

  * Breaching your obligation as the employer to consult with employees representatives and to provide them with information under the [ Protection of Employment Act 1977 ](https://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1977/act/7/enacted/en/html) (collective redundancies) 
  * Failing to provide a statement of wages and deductions from wages under the [ Payment of Wages Act 1991 ](https://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1991/act/25/enacted/en/print.html)
  * Failing to provide an employee with a statement of the average hourly rate of pay for a pay reference period under the [ National Minimum Wage Act 2000 ](https://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2000/act/5/enacted/en/html)

##  Making a complaint

](https://www.workplacerelations.ie/en/Complaints_Disputes/Refer_a_Dispute_Make_a_Complaint/)
