#  Blue Flag beaches and marinas in Ireland

  * Introduction 
  * Rules 
  * How to apply 
  * Contact details 

##  Introduction

The Blue Flag is an international environmental award made to beaches and
marinas throughout the world that demonstrate good environmental standards and
have good sanitary and safety facilities. The award is made by the Foundation
for Environmental Education (FEE), an independent non-profit organisation. The
Blue Flag Award is in place in [ over 50 countries internationally
](http://www.blueflag.org/) . You can find information on the beaches and
marinas in Ireland that have received awards at [ beachawards.ie
](http://beachawards.ie/blue-flag/) .

In Ireland, the Blue Flag is operated by [ An Taisce
](http://www.antaisce.ie/) . An Taisce also operates a [ Green Coast Award
](http://cleancoasts.org/homepage/) scheme for beaches that meet [ EU bathing
water quality standards ](http://www.epa.ie/water/wm/bathing/) but also retain
their natural, unspoilt environment. You can find out the water quality at
Ireland's designated bathing areas at [ beaches.ie ](https://www.beaches.ie/)
.

##  Rules

A Blue Flag award is awarded to a beach or marina for one season (July to
August) only.

The award of a Blue Flag to a beach depends on compliance with 33 criteria
covering the following aspects:

  * Water quality 
  * Environmental education and information 
  * Environmental management 
  * Safety and services 

There are 29 criteria that a marina must comply with. They cover the same
areas of water quality, environmental education and information, environmental
management, safety, and services. A marina can be part of a larger harbour
with other activities if it is separated from other harbour activities.

The criteria must be adhered to gain a Blue Flag. If the criteria are not
fulfilled during the season or the conditions change, the Blue Flag may be
withdrawn.

The Blue Flag criteria are minimum criteria. A country can choose to have
stricter criteria.

You can view the [ Blue Flag beach criteria ](http://beachawards.ie/blue-
flag/blue-flag-beach-criteria/) and the [ Blue Flag marina criteria
](http://beachawards.ie/blue-flag/blue-flag-marina-criteria/) on the
beachawards.ie website.

##  How to apply

The [ relevant local authority applies for a Blue Flag award
](https://beachawards.ie/blue-flag/application-procedure/) for its beaches.
The local authority files the application form (with enclosed documentation)
and sends it to the National Jury. For applications for beaches, approved
bathing water data from the previous year must be submitted as documentation
together with the application as well.

The marina owner is responsible for applying for a Blue Flag award for a
marina.

To be eligible for the Blue Flag, a beach or marina must meet all imperative
requirements and achieve a maximum number of guideline criteria that are taken
into account.

###  The National Jury

In Ireland the National Jury consists of representatives from the following
organisations:

  * An Taisce 
  * The Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage 
  * The Disability Federation of Ireland 
  * The Environmental Protection Agency 
  * FÃ¡ilte Ireland 
  * The National Parks Wildlife Service 
  * Sailing Ireland 
  * Trinity College Dublin 
  * University College Dublin 
  * Water Safety Ireland 

The National Jury evaluates applications for compliance with the Blue Flag
criteria. It gives approval or rejection on the national level. In special
cases, the National Jury can propose a dispensation. The approved applications
and the dispensations are then forwarded by the National Jury to the
International Jury.

###  The International Jury

The [ International Jury ](https://www.blueflag.global/international-jury)
consists of various members from different international organisations.

The International Jury evaluates before it finally decides which beaches and
marinas will be awarded the Blue Flag for the season.
