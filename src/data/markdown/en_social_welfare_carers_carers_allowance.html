##  What is Carer’s Allowance?

Carer's Allowance is a weekly social welfare payment to people who care for
someone because of their:

  * Age 
  * Disability, or 
  * Illness (including mental illness). 

To qualify for the payment, your income must be below a certain amount (see
‘How your income is assessed for Carer’s Allowance’ below).

If you care for 2 or more people, your rate of Carer's Allowance is increased
by 50% (maximum) each week.

If you get another social welfare payment, you may get [ half-rate Carer’s
Allowance ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/carers/half-
rate-carers-allowance/) .

###  **Carer's Support Grant**

If you get Carer's Allowance, you automatically get [ Carer's Support Grant
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/carers/carers-support-
grant/) in June each year.

###  **Other supports for carers**

If you get Carer's Allowance, you can also get:

  * [ GP visit card ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/health/medical-cards-and-gp-visit-cards/gp-visit-cards/)
  * [ Free Travel ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/extra-social-welfare-benefits/free-travel/)
  * [ Household Benefits Package ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/extra-social-welfare-benefits/household-benefits-package/) (if you live with the person you care for) 

##  Can I get Carer's Allowance?

You can get Carer's Allowance if you care full-time for someone who is:

  * Aged 16 or over, and who is so incapacitated that they need full-time care and attention for at least 12 months, **or**
  * Aged under 16, and for whom you get [ Domiciliary Care Allowance ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/disability-and-illness/domiciliary-care-allowance/) . 

You can read ‘What counts as full-time care’ below.

As well as providing full-time care, you must:

  * Be aged 18 or over 
  * Be [ habitually resident ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/social-assistance-payments/habitual-residence-condition/) in Ireland 
  * Not be employed, self-employed, doing voluntary work, training, or any education courses for more than 18.5 hours a week 
  * Not live in a hospital, convalescent home, or a similar institution 
  * Pass a means test (see ‘How your income is assessed for Carer’s Allowance' below) 

###  **Care-sharing**

You can share your caring responsibilities with another carer, where you each
care for the person on a part-time basis.

You both must provide care from Monday to Sunday, but on alternate weeks. By
law, anyone providing full-time care on a part-time basis must do so for a
complete week (Monday to Sunday).

You must meet all the usual qualifying conditions for Carer’s Allowance.

In this case, you and the second carer share:

  * A single Carer’s Allowance payment, and 
  * The annual Carer's Support Grant. 

You each get [ Free Travel ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-
welfare/extra-social-welfare-benefits/free-travel/) .

##  What counts as full-time care?

To get Carer’s Allowance, you must care full-time for someone who is:

  * Aged 16 or over, and who is so incapacitated that they need full-time care and attention for at least 12 months, **or**
  * Aged under 16, and for whom you get [ Domiciliary Care Allowance ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/disability-and-illness/domiciliary-care-allowance/) . 

Full-time care means:

  * You continuously supervise the person so they don’t put themselves in danger, **or**
  * You continuously supervise and assist the person throughout the day with personal care (for example, helping them to eat, drink, get washed and dressed). 

You must care for them at least 35 hours per week, over 5 to 7 days.

The Department of Social Protection (DSP) will decide if you are providing
full time care.

###  **Time spent in hospital, respite, or day care**

The person you care for cannot live in a hospital, convalescent home, or
another similar institution.

However, you can continue getting Carer’s Allowance:

  * For up to 13 weeks, if you or the person you care for has medical treatment in a hospital (or another treatment in an institution) 
  * For up to 26 weeks in a 12-month period if your child is in hospital getting medical or other treatment of a temporary nature. Your child must meet the criteria for [ Domiciliary Care Allowance ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/social-welfare-payments/disability-and-illness/domiciliary-care-allowance/)
  * For up to 18 months, if your baby is kept in hospital for medical treatment immediately after their birth (see below) 
  * The person you care for attends non-residential rehabilitation training, or a day care centre 

####  **Baby kept in hospital after birth**

If your baby is kept in hospital, or in another institution to get medical
treatment immediately after their birth, you can get Carer’s Allowance for up
to 18 months while they are in hospital. This applies to babies born on or
after 1 January 2023 only.

To get Carer’s Allowance, your baby must meet the criteria for [ Domiciliary
Care Allowance ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/social-
welfare-payments/disability-and-illness/domiciliary-care-allowance/) .
However, you do not need to be getting Domiciliary Care Allowance to get [
Carer’s Benefit ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-
welfare/carers/carers-benefit/) .

####  **Residential care**

If you provide care on a part-time basis to someone who attends a residential
institution (for example, every other week), you can get Carer’s Allowance for
the weeks you provide care.

####  **Moving into a nursing home**

If the person you care for moves into a nursing home on a full-time basis, you
can continue getting Carer’s Allowance for 12 weeks. You must give the DSP a
letter from the nursing home with the date the person was admitted.

###  **If you go on holidays**

You can take up to 3 weeks’ holidays in any calendar year (January – December)
without this affecting your Carer’s Allowance payment.

If you are away, you must arrange full-time care for the person you care for.

###  **Payment after a death**

If the person you care for dies, you will continue getting Carer's Allowance
for 12 weeks after their death. This also applies to people who are ‘care-
sharing’ (see above).

If you die, your spouse or civil partner can get your Carer’s Allowance for 6
weeks after your death. They must already be getting a separate social welfare
payment for themselves.

##  Means test for Carer’s Allowance

Carer’s Allowance is a means-tested payment.

In a means test, the Department of Social Protection (DSP) looks at all your
sources of income. They also look at your spouse, civil partner, or
cohabitant’s income. To qualify, your combined weekly income must be below a
certain amount.

Your rate of Carer’s Allowance may be reduced depending on your weekly means
(see ‘How much is Carer's Allowance’ below).

The main items included in the means test for Carer’s Allowance are:

###  **Cash income**

The DSP looks at your cash income (such as payment from work), that you or
your spouse, civil partner or cohabitant may have.

Some [ cash income is not included in the means test
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-
system/means-test-for-social-welfare-payments/cash-income-not-included-in-the-
social-welfare-means-test/) , including certain income from renting a room in
your home.

###  **Capital**

Capital includes your savings, investments, shares, and any property you have
(but not your own home). The first €50,000 of your capital does not affect
your Carer’s Allowance payment. If you are a couple, your combined capital is
divided by 2 and the €50,000 disregard is applied to this amount.

Read about [ capital not included in the means test
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-
system/means-test-for-social-welfare-payments/how-to-assess-your-means-from-
capital-for-social-welfare-payments/) .

You may also want to read about [ how a couple’s means are assessed for
Carer’s Allowance ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-
welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/means-test-for-social-welfare-
payments/assessing-the-means-of-a-couple/#8e6b86) .

###  **Maintenance**

The DSP looks at maintenance paid to you. From 6 June 2024, child maintenance
payments are not included in the means test for Carer's Allowance. Read more
about [ how maintenance is assessed as means
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-
system/means-test-for-social-welfare-payments/maintenance-and-social-welfare-
payments/) .

###  **How your means are assessed**

To get your total weekly means, the DSP adds your sources of assessable income
(such as cash and capital) together.

  * If you are single, €450 of your total weekly income is not taken into account in the means test for Carer’s Allowance. 
  * If you are married, in a civil partnership, or [ cohabiting ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/birth-family-relationships/cohabiting-couples/rights-of-cohabiting-couples/#e6e823) , the first €900 of your combined total weekly income is not taken into account. 

For a couple, your means are taken to be half of the total means of yourself
and your spouse, civil partner, or cohabitant. Read our page about [ assessing
the means of a couple for Carer’s Allowance
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-
system/means-test-for-social-welfare-payments/assessing-the-means-of-a-
couple/#8e6b86) .

The DSP will calculate your weekly means. If your weekly means is over a
certain amount, you will get a reduced rate of Carer’s Allowance. You can find
the reduced Carer’s Allowance rates based on weekly means in [ DSP’s rates of
payment booklet
](https://www.gov.ie/pdf/?file=https://assets.gov.ie/11117/6beb1ad2f51346f4ad6f27db1c473e59.pdf#page=null)
.

You can also find [ detailed information about the means test for Carer’s
Allowance ](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/b95008-operational-guidelines-
carers-allowance/) on Gov.ie.

##  How much is Carer's Allowance?

Your Carer’s Allowance payment is made up of:

  * A personal rate for yourself, and 
  * Extra amounts for any [ child dependants ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/claiming-a-social-welfare-payment/claiming-and-increase-in-your-payment-for-a-child-dependant/) (however, you don’t get an increase for a child if you get [ half-rate Carer's Allowance ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/carers/half-rate-carers-allowance/) ). 

You cannot get an [ increase for a qualified adult
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-
system/claiming-a-social-welfare-payment/claiming-an-increase-in-your-social-
welfare-payment-for-an-adult-dependant/) with Carer’s Allowance.

**Weekly** **Carer's Allowance rates 2024**

---|---|---  
Aged under 66, caring for 1 person  |  €248  |  Child aged under 12: €46 (full rate), €23 (half rate)  Child aged 12 and over: €54 (full rate), €27 (half rate)   
Aged under 66, caring for 2 or more people  |  €372   
Aged 66 or over, and caring for 1 person  |  €286   
Aged 66 or over, and caring for 2 or more people  |  €429   
  
####  **Parenting alone**

If you are parenting alone, you can get a full-rate increase for a child
dependant.

####  **Living with your spouse or partner**

If you live with your spouse, civil partner, or partner, you can get a half-
rate increase for a child dependant.

###  **Caring for more than one person**

If you care for 2 or more people, your rate of Carer's Allowance is increased
by 50% (maximum) each week.

###  **Credits**

You may get [ credited social insurance contributions (PRSI)
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-
system/social-insurance-prsi/credited-social-insurance-contributions/) while
you are getting Carer's Allowance.

###  **Tax**

Carer's Allowance is a [ taxable source of income
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-
system/claiming-a-social-welfare-payment/taxation-of-social-welfare-payments/)
. However, you may not have to pay tax on it if it’s your only source of
income.

###  **State Pension (Contributory)**

The following schemes can help you qualify for the [ State Pension
(Contributory) ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/older-
and-retired-people/state-pension-contributory/) , or get a higher rate of
payment:

  * [ Long-Term Carers Contributions ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/social-insurance-prsi/long-term-carers-contributions/)
  * [ Homemaker's Scheme ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/social-insurance-prsi/homemakers-scheme/)
  * [ HomeCaring Periods Scheme ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/social-insurance-prsi/homecaring-periods-scheme/)

If you [ defer claiming your State Pension (Contributory)
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/social-welfare-
payments/older-and-retired-people/deferring-your-state-pension-contributory/)
to after age 66, you can continue getting Carer’s Allowance. When you start
claiming your pension, you will get a half-rate payment if you meet the
qualifying conditions.

##  Getting other payments with Carer’s Allowance

You can get a [ half-rate Carer’s Allowance
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/carers/half-rate-
carers-allowance/) paid with other social welfare payments, except the

  * [ Jobseeker's Transitional payment ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/social-welfare-payments/unemployed-people/jobseekers-transitional-payment/)

###  **One-Parent Family Payment**

If you get half-rate Carer’s Allowance, you may also get [ One-Parent Family
Payment ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/families-and-
children/one-parent-family-payment/) until your youngest child turns 16 (as
long as you continue to meet the conditions for both schemes).

###  **Jobseeker's Transitional payment**

You cannot get Carer’s Allowance with [ Jobseeker's Transitional payment
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/unemployed-
people/jobseekers-transitional-payment/) (JST). However, if you are getting
JST and qualify for Carer’s Allowance, you can ask to be assessed for Carer’s
