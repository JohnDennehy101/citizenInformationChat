disabilities/) is one of the main funding sources for students with

and postgraduate students.

You may be entitled to support under the FSD even if you did not access
college through the [ Disability Access Route to Education (DARE scheme)
](/en/education/third-level-education/applying-to-college/third-level-
admissions-scheme-for-students-with-disabilities/) .

behalf by your college.

You will need to:

  * Register with the disability or access office in your college 
  * Provide medical verification of your disability (for example, a consultantâ€™s report) 

The college will then carry out a needs assessment to identify the appropriate
supports required.

responsible for managing the funding and has full discretion on how the FSD is
allocated.

The college uses the funding to support your needs as decided by a needs
assessment. Generally, you will not need to organise services, supports or
equipment yourself as this will by done by the college in consultation with
you.

You should contact the disability or access office in your college for more
information on how to apply for FSD and read about [ the FSD on the HEA
website ](https://hea.ie/funding-governance-performance/funding/student-
finance/fund-for-students-with-disabilities/) .
