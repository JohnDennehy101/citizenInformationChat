##  Fund for Students with Disabilities

disabilities/) is one of the main funding sources for students with
disabilities. The FSD is available to full-time and part-time undergraduate
and postgraduate students.

You may be entitled to support under the FSD even if you did not access
college through the [ Disability Access Route to Education (DARE scheme)
](/en/education/third-level-education/applying-to-college/third-level-
admissions-scheme-for-students-with-disabilities/) .

  * Institutes of technology 
  * Further education and training colleges 
  * Post-leaving certificate colleges 
  * Other approved colleges 
  * Certain courses in EU and UK colleges and higher education institutions

behalf by your college.

You will need to:

  * Register with the disability or access office in your college 
  * Provide medical verification of your disability (for example, a consultant’s report) 

The college will then carry out a needs assessment to identify the appropriate
supports required.

Funding is allocated to the college, not the student. The college is
responsible for managing the funding and has full discretion on how the FSD is
allocated.

The college uses the funding to support your needs as decided by a needs
assessment. Generally, you will not need to organise services, supports or
equipment yourself as this will by done by the college in consultation with
you.

You should contact the disability or access office in your college for more
information on how to apply for FSD and read about [ the FSD on the HEA
website ](https://hea.ie/funding-governance-performance/funding/student-
finance/fund-for-students-with-disabilities/) .
