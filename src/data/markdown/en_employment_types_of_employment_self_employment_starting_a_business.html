##  Introduction

If you are thinking about starting a business, there are supports available to
help you with planning, getting set up and funding and finance.

You should consider the regulations that apply (for example, in relation to
paying tax and hiring employees), and the range of financial supports
available to you.

Whether you are currently employed, unemployed, or coming from outside Ireland
to set up a business, this page covers some of these important topics.

Read more about  becoming self-employed  , or visit our page about [ sources
of information on starting a business ](/en/employment/types-of-
employment/self-employment/finding-information-on-starting-business/) .

You can also visit [ your Local Enterprise Office
](https://www.localenterprise.ie/Find-Your-Local-Enterprise-Office/) for
advice on how to start, grow and develop your business. There are 31 Local
Enterprise Offices in Ireland who work with micro-enterprises and sole
traders. [ Enterprise Ireland ](http://www.enterprise-ireland.com/) gives
support and advice to larger start-ups and Small and Medium Enterprises
(SMEs). See more below on ‘Where to get advice on starting a business’.

###  If you are a foreign national

If you are from the [ European Economic Area (EEA) or Switzerland
](/en/moving-country/moving-to-ireland/rights-of-residence-in-
ireland/residence-rights-eu-national/) , you do not need permission to set up
a business in Ireland.

If you are a non-EU/EEA and non-Swiss national and you want to open a business
or invest in Ireland, you can apply for permission under the [ Immigration
Investor Programme and Start Up Entrepreneur Programme
](http://www.inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/Pages/New%20Programmes%20for%20Investors%20and%20Entrepreneurs)
.

Read more about [ coming to set up a business or invest in Ireland
](/en/moving-country/working-in-ireland/migrant-workers/coming-to-set-up-a-
business-in-ireland/) .

##  Deciding on the legal structure of your business

The type of legal structure you choose depends on the kind of business you are
running, who you will do business with, and your attitude to risk.

You should get advice from a solicitor or accountant when considering the
structure for your business. Get [ contact details for solicitors in Ireland
](https://www.lawsociety.ie/Find-a-Solicitor/) on the Law Society website.

You can set up your business as:

  * A sole trader 
  * A partnership 
  * A limited company 

###  Sole trader

If you choose to be a sole trader, you are ‘self-employed’ and you do not have
a business partner. You are personally responsible for the business.

Your main legal duty is to register as a self-employed person with Revenue
(see the section on ‘Tax and PRSI’ below). If you want to use a business name,
you must [ register your business name with the Companies Registration Office
(CRO) ](https://www.cro.ie/Registration/Business-Name) .

While it is relatively simple to set up as a sole trader, your personal assets
could be used to pay your creditors if your business fails.

###  Partnership

A partnership is where you set up your business with 1 or more people (known
as ‘partners’). Each partner is jointly responsible for running the business,
and each partner must pay income tax, PRSI and USC on their share of the
profits.

If the business fails, all partners are jointly responsible for the debt.

Your partnership agreement should be drawn up by a solicitor.

###  Limited company

If you set up your business as a limited company, you and your business are
seen as separate entities. In general, this means that if the company gets
into debt, the creditors only have a claim on the assets of the company (not
your personal assets).

To set up a limited company, you must register with the [ Companies
Registration Office (CRO) ](http://www.cro.ie/) . Your company must then
return reports and accounts to the CRO each year. Register your business name
and file your company returns online using the CRO’s [ CORE (Companies Online
Registration Environment) ](https://core.cro.ie/) .

####  Different types of companies

Under the [ Companies Act 2014
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2014/act/38/enacted/en/html) , private
companies limited by shares can be registered as either:

  * An LTD (private company limited by shares) 
  * A DAC (Designated Activity Company) 

Read more about [ the requirements for different types of companies
](https://www.cro.ie/Registration/Company/Company-Type-Information) on the CRO
website.

##  How to get funding

If you are starting a business, you can apply for funding and grants from a
range of sources. For example:

###  Microfinance Ireland

Small Business Cashflow Loans from €2,000 to €25,000 are available through [
Microfinance Ireland (MFI) ](https://microfinanceireland.ie/loan-
packages-2/covid19/) . The loan terms are typically 3 years and there is a 1%
discount on the APR Rate if you apply through your Local Enterprise Office.
Once all documents are received, you will have a credit decision within 10
working days.

The loan is open to sole traders, partnerships, and limited companies with
fewer than 10 full-time employees and annual turnover of up to €2 million. You
can apply through the MFI website or through your Local Enterprise Office.

###  Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs)

Your [ Local Enterprise Office ](https://www.localenterprise.ie/Find-Your-
Local-Enterprise-Office/) offers a range of financial supports, depending on
your business needs. For example:

###  If you are currently unemployed

eligible for the [ Back to Work Enterprise Allowance (BTWEA) ](/en/social-
welfare/social-welfare-payments-and-work/back-to-work-enterprise-allowance/)
or the [ Short-Term Enterprise Allowance (STEA) ](/en/social-welfare/social-

offices/?referrer=http://www.gov.ie/en/service/40cf48-find-your-local-intreo-
office/) for more information.

##  If you have credit difficulties

If you have a small or medium business and your application for credit is
refused by one of the participating banks, you can [ apply to the Credit
Review Office to have your case reviewed ](http://www.creditreview.ie/how-to-
apply/) .

To be [ eligible for a review ](http://www.creditreview.ie/am-i-eligible/) ,

##  Tax, PRSI and employing staff

###  Paying tax and getting tax relief

How your business is taxed depends on whether it is a ‘limited company’ (see
‘Deciding on the legal structure of your business’ above).

If your business is a company, then it is liable for [ corporation tax
](http://www.revenue.ie/en/tax/ct/index.html) . If your business is not a
company, you are considered to be a ‘sole trader’ and you pay tax under the [
self-assessment system ](http://www.revenue.ie/en/tax/it/leaflets/it10.html) .

Read more about [ tax for self-employed people ](/en/money-and-tax/tax/income-
tax/taxation-of-self-employed-people/) , or visit [ Revenue's website for
information on registering for tax ](https://www.revenue.ie/en/starting-a-
business/registering-for-tax/index.aspx) .

####  Earned Income tax credit

In 2022, self-employed people can claim an [ Earned Income tax credit of
€1,775 ](https://www.revenue.ie/en/personal-tax-credits-reliefs-and-
exemptions/income-and-employment/earned-income-credit/index.aspx) . This tax
credit is also available for business owners or managers who are not eligible
for a PAYE credit on their salary income.

If a taxpayer also qualifies for the PAYE tax credit, the combined value of
these 2 tax credits cannot exceed €1,775.

####  SURE tax refund

The [ Start Up Refunds for Entrepreneurs (SURE) ](http://www.djei.ie/en/News-
And-Events/Department-News/2015/May/Government-cash-for-startups-through-SURE-
tax-refund-%E2%80%93-Minister-Bruton-Minister-Noonan-.html) is a tax refund
scheme that allows eligible people to get a refund of up to 41% of the capital
they invest in starting a business.

Under the SURE scheme, you may be entitled to a refund of PAYE income tax that
you paid over the 6 years before the year in which you invest.

See [ Revenue's website for more details on the SURE scheme
](https://www.revenue.ie/en/personal-tax-credits-reliefs-and-
exemptions/investment/relief-investment-corporate-trades/start-up-relief-for-
entrepreneurs.aspx) . You can [ use the online calculator on sure.gov.ie
](https://sure.enterprise-ireland.com/Calculator) to estimate your potential
refund.

####  Start-up companies

New companies may get [ tax relief on the first 3 years of corporation tax
](https://www.revenue.ie/en/starting-a-business/initiatives-for-startup-
businesses-and-smes/tax-relief-for-new-startup-companies/index.aspx) . The
value of the relief will be linked to the amount of employers’ PRSI paid by a
company in an accounting period, up to a maximum of €5,000 per employee.

####  Capital Gains Tax (CGT) relief

If you sell your business on or after 1 January 2017, a lower rate of Capital
Gains Tax (10%) will apply to the net chargeable gains arising from the sale
of all (or part) of your business, up to a lifetime limit of €1 million.

Read more about [ capital gains for companies
](https://www.revenue.ie/en/companies-and-charities/capital-gains-for-
companies/index.aspx) on the Revenue website.

###  Paying PRSI

If you are self-employed, you pay [ Class S social insurance contributions
](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/social-insurance-prsi/class-
s-prsi/) . You can read more about [ PRSI for the Self-Employed (pdf)
](https://assets.gov.ie/38671/0aa2cf3d831a4076b1b6208e1287d9f9.pdf) from the
Department of Social Protection.

###  Employing staff

If you are starting a business and decide to recruit staff, you must [
register for PAYE and PRSI with Revenue
](http://www.revenue.ie/en/business/employers-paye.html) .

You can find [ information about employers' obligations in Ireland
