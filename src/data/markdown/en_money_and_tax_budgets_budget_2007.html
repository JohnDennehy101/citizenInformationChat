rent relief.  
  

###  DIRT administration change

DIRT can currently be refunded to an individual who is exempt from income tax
if the person or the person’s spouse is over 65 years of age or permanently
incapacitated. The rules relating to such individuals are now being changed so
that in future they may notify their financial institution of their status and
receive the interest without deduction of DIRT. These changes will be included
in the 2007 Finance Bill.  
  

###  Administrative changes to help taxpayers claim reliefs

A number of changes in administrative procedures are being introduced which
will make it easier for taxpayers to claim reliefs to which they are entitled.
For 2007 all age-related tax credits will, where possible, be credited
automatically to the taxpayer where a verified date of birth can be
established through Revenue or Social Welfare records.  
  
A system will be implemented to credit tax relief on trade union subscriptions
automatically, based on trade union membership lists. For 2008 it is planned
to move, where possible, to automatic repayments in respect of non-reimbursed
hospital expenses, prescribed drugs pharmacy costs and certain tuition fees to
the extent that this is possible using information from appropriate third
parties.  
  
Tax relief due on medical insurance paid by employers that has been subject to
benefit-in-kind taxation will be automatically included in the employee tax
credit. Work will be progressed on applying similar procedures in due course
to nursing home and other medical expenses that qualify for tax relief.  
  

###  Threshold for tax clearance certificates

effect from 1 January 2007. Further details will be provided in the Finance
Bill.  
  

###  Vehicle Registration Tax (VRT) - Public Consultation

It is planned to change the current VRT system to take greater account of
environmental issues, in particular carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. A public
consultation will be undertaken in this regard with a view to making such a
move with effect from a target date of 1 January 2008. Submissions are invited
from interested parties by 1 March 2007.  
  
Submissions are also being invited from interested parties, by 1 March 2007,

##  VAT

###  Small and medium size businesses

The VAT registration thresholds for small businesses are being increased from
€27,500 to €35,000 in the case of services, and from €55,000 to €70,000 in the
case of goods. These increases will take effect from 1 March 2007.  
  

###  VAT cash accounting threshold

The annual VAT cash accounting threshold for small firms is being increased
from €635,000 to €1,000,000 with effect from 1 March 2007.  
  

###  Less frequent vat returns for small businesses

The frequency of VAT payments, currently six per year, for smaller businesses
is being reduced with effect from July 2007. For businesses with a yearly
liability of €3,000 or less, the option of filing returns on a half-yearly
basis will be available. For businesses with a yearly liability between €3,001
and €14,400, the option of filing returns every four months will be available.
This will reduce compliance costs for the firms in question.  
  

###  VAT relief for conferences

A specific measure which will allow deductibility of VAT on conference-related
accommodation expenses will be introduced during 2007.  
  

###  Reduction of VAT rate on child car seats

The VAT rate on child car seats will be reduced from 21% to 13.5% with effect
from 1 May 2007.  
  

###  Review of VAT on property transactions - public consultation

The Revenue Commissioners, over the last two years, have carried out a review
of the current system of applying VAT on property transactions. The review
recommends significant changes to the system. It is planned to engage in a
wide consultation process with interested parties before deciding on any
changes which might appropriately be implemented in the 2008 Finance Act.

clearance with the European Commission under State aid rules.  
  

###  Leased land exemption

###  Extension of stamp duty relief for farm consolidation

purposes of consolidating each farmer’s holdings was introduced on 1 July 2005
for a period of two years. The relief is being extended for a further two
years to 30 June 2009. The relief will also be extended to qualifying
exchanges of land where only one farmer is consolidating his/her holding. In
such cases both farmers can qualify for relief, provided both farmers meet all
other conditions of the relief.  
  

###  Changes to the stamp duty relief for young trained farmers

Stamp duty relief is available for farmers acquiring land, who are aged under
35 and have specific agricultural training. Amendments are now being made to
the education criteria and refunds procedure in this relief. Firstly, the
FETAC Level 6 Advanced Certificate in Agriculture will become the new minimum
education requirement from 31 March 2008; secondly, the qualifying third-level
course titles are being updated; and finally, the refunds procedure is being
simplified.  
  

###  Capital Gains Tax retirement relief – disposals of leased land

An exemption from CGT applies in the case of individuals aged 55 and over who
dispose of qualifying business or farming assets. In order for a farming asset
to qualify under the relief it must have been owned and used for farming
purposes for at least ten years prior to disposal. The relief is now being
extended, in certain circumstances, to disposals of land where the land had
been leased prior to disposal.  
  

###  Capital Acquisitions Tax agricultural relief – off-farm principal private
residences

CAT agricultural relief provides relief from CAT on 90% of the value of a gift
or inheritance. In order to qualify for the relief, 80% of a farmer’s total
assets (after receipt of the gift/inheritance) must consist of qualifying
agricultural assets. Off-farm principal private residences are not considered
such assets for the purposes of this relief. This provision is now being
amended so that an individual may off-set borrowings on an off-farm principal
private residence against the property’s value, for the purpose of the 80%
test.  
  

##  Capital Gains Tax

###  Increase in threshold for CGT retirement relief

An exemption from CGT applies in the case of individuals aged 55 and over who
dispose of qualifying business or farming assets subject to certain
conditions. Disposals made to a child or favourite niece/nephew are relieved
in full. All other disposals are relieved up to the threshold of €500,000.
This threshold is being increased from €500,000 to €750,000 from 1 January
2007.  
  

##  Stamp Duty

###  Stamp duty on mortgage deeds

is a separate stamp duty from that which is applied to the conveyance of
property). This is being abolished for mortgage deeds executed on or after 7
December 2006.  
  

###  New stamp duty exemption for sporting bodies

conditions. The exemption will relate to purchases of land for the purposes of
promoting games or sports.
