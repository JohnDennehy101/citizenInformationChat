##  Taxation

###  Income tax

The **Home Carer's Tax Credit** that is given to married couples or civil
partners where one spouse or civil partner works in the home caring for a
dependent person is increasing from €810 to €1,000 for 2016. The home carer’s
income threshold is increasing from €5,080 to €7,200.

A **new Earned Income Credit** of €550 is being introduced for taxpayers
earning self-employed trading or professional income in certain cases and to
business owner/managers who are ineligible for a PAYE credit on their salary
income.

###  Universal Social Charge (USC)

Incomes of €13,000 (was €12,012) or less will be exempt from USC in 2016\.
Once your income is over this limit, you will pay the relevant rate of USC on
all of your income. The rates and thresholds for USC will change as follows:

**2015** |  **2016**  
---|---  
Income up to €12,012  |  1.5%  |  Income up to €12,012  |  1%   
€12,012.01 to €17,576.00  |  3.5%  |  €12,012.01 to €18,668.00  |  3%   
€17,576.01 to €70,044.00  |  7%  |  €18,668.00 to €70,044.00  |  5.5%   
Income above €70,044.01  |  8%  |  Income above €70,044.01  |  8%   
Self-employed income in excess of €100,000.01  |  11%  |  Self-employed income in excess of €100,000.01  |  11%   
  
Medical card holders and people aged 70 years and over whose aggregate income
does not exceed €60,000 will pay a reduced rate as follows:

  * The first €12,012 @ 1% 
  * Income over €12,012.01 @ 3% 

###  PRSI

####  Employee PRSI

A new **weekly tapered PRSI credit of €12** is being introduced for employees
insured at Class A whose earnings are between €352.01 and €424 in a week. A
similar PRSI credit will apply to Class E and Class H employees with weekly
earnings between €352.01 and €422 or €424, respectively.

The maximum PRSI credit of €12 per week applies to gross weekly earnings of
€352.01. A person earning €352.01 pays €14.08 PRSI (4%). After the €12 credit
is deducted they will pay PRSI of €2.08.

For people earning between €352.01 and €424, the credit of €12 is reduced by
one-sixth of earnings over €352.01. For example, a person earning €377 would
get a PRSI credit of €7.83 – this is one-sixth of the difference between €377
and €352.01 subtracted from the maximum credit of €12. There is no PRSI credit
once earnings exceed €424 (January 2016). This provision will reduce the
weekly PRSI bill for over 88,000 employees.

####  Employer PRSI

The lower 8.5% Class A rate of employer PRSI will apply to weekly earnings up
to €376. This threshold will increase from the current €356 (January 2016).
This provision will benefit 26,000 employers. These PRSI provisions will cost
€21 million in 2016.

###  Excise duties

The excise duty on **a packet of 20 cigarettes** is increasing by 50 cent
(including VAT) with a pro-rata increase on other tobacco products, with
effect from midnight on 13 October 2015.

The rate of **Motor Tax** is being reduced for all vehicles above 4,000kgs,
with a new annual rate of €500 for vehicle between 4,000kgs and 12,000kgs and
€900 for vehicles over 12,000kgs.

###  Capital Acquisitions Tax

The Group A tax-free threshold, which applies primarily to gifts and
inheritances from parents to their children, is being increased from €225,000
to €280,000. This increase applies in respect of gifts or inheritances
received on or after 14 October 2015.

###  Stamp duty

The current €2.50 per annum **charge on ATM cards** and €5 on combined (ATM
and debit) cards is being abolished from 1 January 2016.

A **new 12 cent fee per ATM withdrawal** is being introduced from 1 January
2016. The total fee paid per annum per card will be capped at €2.50 on ATM
cards and €5 on combined (ATM and debit) cards.

###  Contactless payments

The transaction limit on contactless payments is being increased from €15 to
€30 on 31 October 2015.

###  Local Property Tax (LPT)

Following a review of the Local Property Tax, it is proposed that the
revaluation date for the Local Property Tax should be postponed from 2016 to
2019\. The postponement of the date means that home owners will continue to
pay LPT based on the original valuations that applied for 2013-2016.

The review also proposes some changes as regards exemptions from LPT for
properties significantly affected by pyrite.

###  Other income tax measures

The **Home Renovation Incentive** is being extended until 31 December 2016.

The changes announced to the **Employment and Investment Incentive scheme** in
Budget 2015 are being commenced and the scheme is being amended to include
expansion works on existing nursing homes.

**General Stock Relief** , **Stock Relief for Young Trained Farmers** ,
**Stock Relief for Registered Farm Partnerships** and the **Stamp Duty
Exemption for Young Trained Farmers** are being extended until 31 December
2018.

A **new farm succession transfer partnership model** is being introduced,
subject to EU State Aid approval.

Profits or gains from the occupation of **woodlands** are being removed from
the high earners’ restriction.

between net weekly family income and the applicable weekly family threshold.
This measure will cost €18 million. It will benefit nearly 60,000 families and
over 131,000 children. It will also result in an additional 1,500 households

93,500 dependants.

####  Carers

The name of the **Respite Care Grant** will be changed to the **Carer’s
Support Grant** to better reflect how it is used by recipients. The grant will
increase by €325 to €1,700 per year for each person being cared for (June
2016). This will benefit 86,000 carers.

**Carer’s Allowance** will be paid for 12 weeks (currently 6 weeks) after the
death of the person being cared for (January 2016).
