##  Before you leave

Whether you are planning to spend time travelling abroad or are moving to
another country to work, start by reading up to date [ travel advice
](https://www.ireland.ie/en/dfa/overseas-travel/advice/) from the Department
of Foreign Affairs (DFA). This includes information on things you should [
know before you go ](https://www.ireland.ie/en/dfa/overseas-travel/know-
before-you-go/) such as:

  * [ Travel insurance ](https://www.ireland.ie/en/dfa/overseas-travel/know-before-you-go/travel-insurance-and-health/)
  * [ Passports and visa requirements ](https://www.dfa.ie/travel/know-before-you-go/passport-and-visas/)
  * [ Safety and security ](https://www.ireland.ie/en/dfa/overseas-travel/know-before-you-go/safety-and-security/)
  * [ Local laws ](https://www.ireland.ie/en/dfa/overseas-travel/know-before-you-go/local-laws-and-customs/)
  * [ Embassy contacts ](https://www.ireland.ie/en/dfa/embassies/)

You can also read our [ general tips for travelling abroad ](/en/travel-and-
recreation/travel-abroad/travelling-abroad-during-covid/) for more on what you
need to do before you leave. For example, you should [ apply for an Irish
passport ](/en/travel-and-recreation/passports/applying-for-or-renewing-an-
irish-passport/) if you don’t have one already.

If possible speak to people you may know who are living in or have previously
lived in the country you are moving to and find out about what life is like
there. Crosscare Irish Diaspora Support Project has more useful tips on what
to consider [ before you leave Ireland ](https://diasporasupport.ie/leaving-
ireland/information/) .

###  Looking after your health

If you are going to the European Economic Area (EEA) or Switzerland to travel
or look for work you should get the [ European Health Insurance Card
](/en/travel-and-recreation/travel-abroad/european-health-insurance-card/) .

If you are travelling outside the EEA, make sure to get specific holiday or
health insurance before you travel. Also check if you need to get [
vaccinations ](/en/travel-and-recreation/travel-abroad/vaccinations-health-
tips/) .

Read more about [ health issues when travelling abroad ](/en/travel-and-
recreation/travel-abroad/travelling-abroad-during-covid/) .

###  Driving abroad

Make sure that your driving licence is in date before you leave Ireland.

You can [ drive on your Irish driving licence in any EU country
](https://www.ndls.ie/driving-abroad.html#where-do-i-need-an-international-
licence) , as long as your licence is current and valid. You must also be over
18, apart from in Austria, Hungary and the UK where you can be age 17.

To drive in other countries, you may need to [ apply for an international
driving permit (IDP) ](https://www.ndls.ie/driving-abroad.html#how-to-get-an-
international-driver-permit) before you move abroad.

In some countries, you may be able to [ exchange your Irish driving licence
](https://www.ndls.ie/driving-abroad.html#irish-licence-holders-taking-up-
residence-abroad) for a driving licence issued in that country.

You cannot drive on your Irish learner permit outside of the Republic of
Ireland.

###  Important documents and consular support

As well as your passport, bring [ other useful documents ](/en/moving-
country/moving-abroad/leaving-ireland/other-useful-documents/) with you,
including:

  * Your birth certificate 
  * Your [ driving licence ](/en/travel-and-recreation/motoring/driver-licensing/full-driving-licence/) and/or international driving permit 
  * Your student card 
  * Any visas or work permits you may need 
  * [ European Health Insurance Card ](/en/travel-and-recreation/travel-abroad/european-health-insurance-card/) and/or other documents relating to health insurance 
  * Your curriculum vitae 
  * Any relevant certificates from education or training courses you have completed 
  * References for work 
  * Emergency contact information 
  * Contact names and numbers of your family/friends/next-of-kin in Ireland 

You can also [ register your details with the DFA
](https://www.ireland.ie/en/dfa/overseas-travel/citizens-registration/) . This
will allow the DFA to contact you in the event of an unforeseen crisis (such
as a natural disaster or civil unrest), or a family emergency. The DFA also
provides [ diplomatic supports ](/en/moving-country/moving-abroad/leaving-
ireland/diplomatic-supports/) for Irish people abroad. Look up contact details
for the local Irish embassy or consulate in the country you are going to at
www.dfa.ie/embassies.

##  Working abroad

Whether you are planning to [ work within the European Union (EU)
](/en/moving-country/moving-abroad/working-abroad/working-in-the-eu/) or [
work in a country outside the EU ](/en/moving-country/moving-abroad/working-
abroad/working-outside-the-eu/) , it can be helpful to look for work before
you leave Ireland.

You can find out about [ work and retirement in the EU
](http://europa.eu/youreurope/citizens/work/index_en.htm) on europa.eu. It has
information on a range of topics including [ residence formalities
](http://europa.eu/youreurope/citizens/residence/index_en.htm) and [ travel
](http://europa.eu/youreurope/citizens/travel/index_en.htm) . If you are
planning to work in the EU you should also check with your [ local employment
services ](https://www.gov.ie/en/collection/d6f636-employment-services-
offices/) office or [ Intreo centre ](http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/Intreo---
Contact-Information.aspx) . Each office has a [ EURES noticeboard
](http://ec.europa.eu/eures/home.jsp?lang=en) advertising vacancies from a
range of European countries.

You can read about [ working holidays ](/en/moving-country/moving-
abroad/working-abroad/working-holidays-for-irish-citizens/) abroad.

###  Volunteering

If you are interested in working as a volunteer in another country, you can
read more information about volunteer opportunities abroad from [ Comhlámh
](https://comhlamh.org/volunteering-opportunities-overseas/) and [ Volunteer
Ireland ](https://www.volunteer.ie/resources/links/international-
volunteering/) .

##  Social security

If you leave Ireland to live or work in another country or if you are
returning to your own country having worked in Ireland you may be entitled to
receive [ social security benefits in the country you are moving to
](/en/moving-country/moving-abroad/leaving-ireland/leaving-ireland-and-your-
social-security-entitlements/) .

You can find information about [ social security arrangements between Ireland
and other countries ](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/claiming-
a-social-welfare-payment/social-insurance-contributions-from-abroad/) .

If you leave your employment to work as a [ volunteer development worker
](/en/moving-country/moving-abroad/working-abroad/voluntary-development-work-
abroad-and-social-insurance/) you may be entitled to credited social security
contributions.

##  Settling in

When you arrive at your destination, you may find that a lot of the attitudes
and practices that you take for granted and consider "normal" are in fact
peculiar to Irish culture. It can take time to settle into a new way of life,
so give yourself time to adjust.

There are Irish organisations, sports and community groups around the world
who can help you to stay connected with Ireland and help you to meet Irish
people abroad. DFA’s [ Global Irish Directory
](https://www.ireland.ie/en/irish-diaspora/) lists over 1,000 Irish groups
around the world.
