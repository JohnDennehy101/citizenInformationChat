#  Disablement Benefit

  * Introduction 
  * Rules 
  * Rates 
  * How to apply 
  * Where to apply 

##  Introduction

Disablement Benefit is a benefit under the [ Occupational Injuries Scheme
](/en/social-welfare/disability-and-illness/occupational-injuries-benefit-
overview/) . It can be paid to you if you suffer a loss of physical or mental
faculty because of an accident at work, an accident travelling directly to or
from work, or a prescribed disease contracted at work. Payment is only made
where the level of disablement following the accident or disease is assessed
at 15% or more.

Where the level of disablement is assessed at 20% or more the benefit is paid
weekly or every 4 weeks (called Disablement Pension). However, where the rate
is assessed at less than 20%, the benefit is paid as a lump sum (called
Disablement Gratuity). The size of the lump sum will vary depending on the
degree of disablement and how long you are reasonably expected to be disabled.

People getting Disablement Pension (without another payment) can work, full or
part-time. If you are getting Disablement Pension and you are unfit for work,
you may qualify for Illness Benefit based on your [ social insurance
contributions ](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/social-
insurance-prsi/social-insurance/) (PRSI). If you do not qualify for [ Illness
Benefit ](/en/social-welfare/disability-and-illness/illness-benefit/) or
another social welfare payment, you may get Incapacity Supplement.

###  Incapacity Supplement

This is an extra supplement with Disablement Pension. You may get Incapacity
Supplement if you are permanently incapable of work as a result of an
occupational accident or disease **and** do not qualify for another social
welfare payment such as Illness Benefit. You may get an increase in your
payment for an [ adult dependant ](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-
system/claiming-a-social-welfare-payment/claiming-an-increase-in-your-social-
welfare-payment-for-an-adult-dependant/) and [ child dependants ](/en/social-
welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/claiming-a-social-welfare-
payment/claiming-and-increase-in-your-payment-for-a-child-dependant/) .
Incapacity Supplement is not payable outside the EU. If you do not qualify for
a State Pension at age 66, you can remain on Incapacity Supplement.

###  Constant Attendance Allowance

This allowance can be paid weekly as an increase to Disablement Pension if you
are so seriously disabled as to need someone (a relative or some other person)
to help you daily at home to attend to your personal needs for a period of at
least 6 months. You must be getting a Disablement Pension of 50% or over.
Entitlement to Constant Attendance Allowance is based on the recommendation of
the Department of Social Protection's medical advisor. You will not get the
allowance during any period you are in a hospital or similar institution.
Constant Attendance Allowance is not payable outside the EU.

###  Taxation of payments under the Occupational Injuries Scheme

Disablement Benefit, Incapacity Supplement and Constant Attendance Allowance
are [ taxable sources of income ](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-
system/claiming-a-social-welfare-payment/taxation-of-social-welfare-payments/)
but you are unlikely to pay tax if they are your only income. Disablement
Gratuity is _not_ taxable.

###  Other social welfare payments

Disablement Benefit is a compensation payment and can be paid at the same time
as most social welfare payments including Jobseeker’s Benefit, Jobseeker’s
Allowance, Disability Allowance, Invalidity Pension, State Pension and One-
Parent Family Payment. It is not considered as means for most social welfare
means-assessed schemes except in the case of Supplementary Welfare Allowance
or Working Family Payment.

Disablement Benefit is disregarded for the means test for Fuel Allowance from
January 2023.

##  Rules

You may get Disablement Benefit if you suffer a loss of physical or mental
faculty because of:

  * An accident at work 
  * An accident while travelling (on an unbroken journey) directly to or from work 
  * [ A prescribed occupational disease ](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/040383-operational-guidelines-occupational-injuries-benefit-disablement-ben/)

###  Loss of physical or mental faculty

The extent of your disablement is assessed by a Department of Social
Protection Medical Assessor. The Medical Assessor determines the extent of
your loss of faculty resulting from your occupational accident or disease.
'Loss of faculty' means your inability to enjoy a normal lifestyle because of
the loss, or partial loss, of your ordinary physical or mental abilities as a
result of your occupational injury or disease. In assessing the degree of loss
of faculty, account is taken of how your current physical and mental condition
compares to your pre-accident state of health, and how you compare with a
healthy person of the same age and sex.

Examples of assessments are as follows:

**Injury** |  **Disablement**  
---|---  
Loss of both hands  |  100%   
Loss of one eye  |  40%   
Loss of thumb  |  30%   
Loss of 2 fingers of one hand  |  20%   
Loss of index finger  |  14%   
  
###  PRSI contributions

In order to qualify for Disablement Benefit, you must have been in employment
on or after 1 May 1967, that was insurable at PRSI Class A, B, D, J or M, at
the time that you sustained the accident or disease.

(Under the Occupational Injuries Scheme, [ civil servants ](/en/government-in-
ireland/how-government-works/national-government/the-civil-service/) insured
at PRSI Class B are not eligible for Disablement Benefit for the first 26
weeks after the date of the accident. This is because, for this 26-week
period, civil servants continue to be paid by their parent Department. After
this 26-week period, a civil servant is paid half their salary and half-rate
Disablement Benefit).

###  Declaring an occupational injury

All work accidents or occupational diseases may not result immediately in
illness or disablement. If you are not immediately incapacitated but wish to
**safeguard your future right to Disablement Benefit** , you should notify
your employer about the accident or disease and apply for a declaration that
your accident or disease was an occupational one. This should be done without
delay. Declaration forms are available from the Injury Benefit Section of the
Department of Social Protection (see 'Where to apply' below).

If your disablement occurs at a later stage, you should claim within 3 months
of becoming aware of it.

###  Duration of payment

Disablement Pensions can be awarded on a provisional basis or for life. When
you are awarded Disablement Pension for life, it is payable until your death.
It is a personal award and is not payable to anyone else after your death.

Provisional awards are paid for a defined period of time. You are informed of
this period when you are notified of an award.

##  Rates

###  Disablement Benefit

Your payment depends on the degree of your disablement, which is medically
assessed. For assessments of less than 20%, Disablement Benefit will normally
be a lump sum (gratuity). The size of the lump sum will vary depending on the
degree of disablement and how long you are expected to be disabled. For
assessments of 20% upwards, a pension is payable.

**Disablement Benefit rates 2024:**

**If you have 100% disablement** , your maximum personal pension is €263.

**If you have between 20-90% disablement** , your maximum personal pension is
as follows:

**Level of disablement** |  **Weekly payment**  
---|---  
\- 90%  |  €236.70   
\- 80%  |  €210.40   
\- 70%  |  €184.10   
\- 60%  |  €157.80   
\- 50%  |  €131.50   
\- 40%  |  €105.20   
\- 30%  |  €78.90   
\- 20%  |  €52.60   
  
**Up to 19% disablement:  
** A lump sum may be payable, up to a maximum of €17,560.

###  Incapacity Supplement

Person aged 66 and over  |  €251.30  |  €166.80   
  
###  Constant Attendance Allowance

Constant Attendance Allowance weekly rate in 2024:

  * €249 

This payment is only made to certain people with over 50% disablement.

##  How to apply

**If you are unable to work after the accident or disease** , you should first
claim Injury Benefit, which can be paid for up to 26 weeks after the accident
or the onset of the disease. Before your [ Injury Benefit ](/en/social-
welfare/disability-and-illness/injury-benefit/) payment finishes, you should
claim Disablement Benefit if you suffer from loss of faculty as a result of
your accident or disease. If you do not claim in time, you may lose some
benefit. You should claim within 3 months of your Injury Benefit claim ending.

**If you are able to work after the accident or disease** , you should claim
Disablement Benefit as soon as possible and within 3 months of the date of the
accident or the onset of the disease. Payment is made from the fourth day of
your disablement. If you do not claim in time, you may lose some benefit. You
should claim within 3 months of the date of your accident or the onset of the
disease.

To apply, fill in a [ Disablement Benefit claim form (pdf)

it to the Disablement Benefit Section - see address below.

welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/social-welfare-appeals/) .
