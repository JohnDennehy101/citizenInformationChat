##  What is Parent's Benefit?

Parent’s Benefit and parent’s leave are for parents in the first 2 years after
their child’s birth or adoption.

Parent’s Benefit is paid while you are on [ parent’s leave
](/en/employment/employment-rights-and-conditions/leave-and-holidays/parents-
leave/) from work if you have enough [ social insurance (PRSI) contributions.
](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/social-insurance-prsi/social-
insurance/)

Each parent can get parent’s leave and Parent’s Benefit.

You must be on [ parent’s leave
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/employment/employment-rights-and-
conditions/leave-and-holidays/parents-leave/) to get Parent’s Benefit.
However, it is possible to qualify for parent’s leave and not get Parent’s
Benefit if you don’t meet the PRSI contribution conditions.

From 1 August 2024, Parent’s Benefit is extended from 7 weeks to 9 weeks, if
you are the parent of:

  * A child born or adopted on or after 1 August 2024 
  * A child under 2 years of age on 1 August 2024 or an adopted child placed with your family less than 2 years on 1 August 2024 - you must complete the extra parent's leave on or before your child’s second birthday or within 2 years of the adoption placement 

You can take your leave in separate weeks or all at once.

Parent’s Benefit is only paid once for both single and multiple births. For
example, if you have twins or adopt 2 children at the same time, you get one
payment.

If you are already getting a social welfare payment, then you may get half-
rate Parent’s Benefit.

##  Rules for Parent's Benefit

Parent’s Benefit is paid in the first 2 years of the child’s birth or
adoption.

You must notify your employer that you intend to take [ parent’s leave
](/en/employment/employment-rights-and-conditions/leave-and-holidays/parents-
leave/) and of your intended dates no later than 6 weeks before your leave.
You then apply for Parent’s Benefit at least 4 weeks before the date you start
your parent’s leave.

If you are self-employed you should apply for Parent's Benefit 6 weeks before
you intend to take parent’s leave.

You need your child’s PPS number to apply for Parent’s Benefit.

###  PRSI contributions for Parent's Benefit

You must have a certain number of paid PRSI contributions on your social
insurance record. Your PRSI contributions can be from both employment and
self-employment. You must meet the conditions when you apply.

You get [ credited contributions or credits ](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-
welfare-system/social-insurance-prsi/credited-social-insurance-contributions/)
automatically when you are getting Parent’s Benefit.

Time spent on the [ COVID-19 Pandemic Unemployment Payment (CPUP)
](/en/social-welfare/unemployed-people/covid19-pandemic-unemployment-payment/)
and the [ COVID-19 Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS)
](/en/employment/unemployment-and-redundancy/employment-wage-subsidy-scheme/)
will be treated as if you are continuing to make insurance contributions at
your normal social insurance class.

The PRSI classes that count for Parent’s Benefit are A, B, C, D, E, H and S
(self-employed).

You must have:

  * 39 weeks PRSI paid in the 12-month period before the first day of your Parent’s Benefit 

Or

  * 39 weeks PRSI paid since first starting work and at least 39 weeks PRSI paid or credited in the relevant tax year or in the year immediately following the relevant tax year. For example, if you are going on parent’s leave in 2024, the relevant tax year is 2022 and the tax year immediately following the relevant tax year is 2023. 

Or

  * 26 weeks PRSI paid in the relevant tax year and at least 26 weeks PRSI paid in the tax year before the relevant tax year. For example, if you are going on parent’s leave in 2024, the relevant tax year is 2022 and the tax year immediately before the relevant tax year is 2021. 

If you were in insurable self-employment before starting insurable employment
(as an employee), your PRSI contributions (Class S) may help you qualify for
Parent’s Benefit if you do not satisfy the employee PRSI conditions as stated
above.

If you are self-employed, you must have:

  * 52 PRSI contributions paid at Class S in the relevant tax year 

Or

  * 52 PRSI contributions paid at Class S in the tax year immediately before the relevant tax year. For example, if you are going on adoptive leave in 2024, the tax year immediately before the relevant tax year is 2021. 

Or

  * 52 qualifying PRSI contributions paid at Class S in the tax year immediately following relevant tax year. For example, if you are going on adoptive leave in 2024, the tax year immediately following the relevant tax year is 2023. 

If you are now self-employed but you were in insurable employment before you
became self-employed, your PRSI contributions (Class A, E and H) in that
employment may help you qualify for Parent’s Benefit if you do not satisfy the
self-employment conditions as stated above.

The relevant tax year is the second last complete tax year before the Benefit
year in which your adoptive leave starts. The Benefit year begins on the first
Monday in January in each calendar year and ends on the Sunday immediately
before the first Monday in the next calendar year. For example, the relevant
tax year is 2022 for claims made in 2024.

###  Insurance from employment in another country

If you had insurable employment in a country covered by EU Regulations and you
have paid at least one full rate PRSI contribution in Ireland, you may combine
your insurance record in that country with your Irish PRSI contributions to
help you qualify for Parent’s Benefit.

More information is available in our document about [ combining your social
insurance contributions from abroad ](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-
system/claiming-a-social-welfare-payment/social-insurance-contributions-from-
abroad/) .

###  If you are already getting a social welfare payment

Half-rate Parent's Benefit may be payable if you are getting any one of the
following payments:

  * [ One-Parent Family Payment ](/en/social-welfare/families-and-children/one-parent-family-payment/)
  * [ Widower's and Surviving Civil Partner's (Contributory) Pension ](/en/social-welfare/death-related-benefits/widowed-persons-contrib-pension/)
  * [ Widower's and Surviving Civil Partner's (Non-Contributory) Pension ](/en/social-welfare/death-related-benefits/widowed-persons-non-contrib-pension/)
  * Death Benefit by way of Widow's/Widower's/Surviving Civil Partner's or Dependent Parents' Pension (under the Occupational Injuries Scheme) 

If you are providing full-time care to another person, you may qualify for [
half-rate Carer's Allowance ](/en/social-welfare/carers/half-rate-carers-
allowance/) with your Parent's Benefit.

If you are getting a [ Working Family Payment (WFP) ](/en/social-
welfare/families-and-children/working-family-payment/) , you can continue to
get your WFP with your Parent's Benefit as long as you meet the qualifying
criteria for both.

###  Leave certification

You must declare that your parent’s leave dates have been approved by your
employer when you apply for Parent’s Benefit. The Department of Social
Protection (DSP) may contact your employer asking them to confirm the dates.

If you are self-employed, you self-certify your leave and declare that you
will not engage in any employment during your parent’s leave.

If you are applying for Parent’s Benefit for an adopted child, you need a [
certificate of placement for the child
](https://www.tusla.ie/services/alternative-care/adoption-services/) . If the
adoption is an intercountry adoption and took place outside the State, you
need a declaration of eligibility and suitability and confirmation of the day
of placement or expected day of placement in writing.

If you decide not to take parent’s leave, you cannot get Parent’s Benefit. You
should tell the Parent’s Benefit section of the Department about any changes
to your parent’s leave arrangements.

###  Payment abroad

**EU citizens:** If you are an EU citizen, you can get Parent’s Benefit for
any period of your parent’s leave spent in another EU country.

**Non-EU citizens:** Non-EU citizens can only get Parent’s Benefit for periods
of parent’s leave spent in Ireland.

There are some exceptions, you can find more information about [ getting
Parent’s Benefit abroad
](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/28c64c-operational-guidelines-parents-
benefit/#entitlement) .

##  How much is Parent's Benefit?

Parent's Benefit is paid at a standard weekly rate.

**Weekly** **Parent’s Benefit rate 2024**

**Parent’s Benefit** |  **Weekly rate**  
---|---  
Standard payment  |  €274   
  
###  Payments for dependants

If you have dependants, your Parent’s Benefit rate is compared to the rate of
Illness Benefit (including increases for dependants) that would be paid to you
if you were absent from work through illness. The higher of the 2 rates is
paid to you.

Although the Illness Benefit rate begins from a lower personal base amount
(€232 is the maximum Illness Benefit personal rate), it takes into account
extra payments for your family. This is why, depending on the circumstances of
your spouse, civil partner or cohabitant and how many children you have, you
may get a higher rate of Illness Benefit.

If your adult dependant (your spouse or partner) is getting a social welfare
payment you will not get an [ Increase for a Qualified Adult (IQA)
](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/claiming-a-social-welfare-
payment/claiming-an-increase-in-your-social-welfare-payment-for-an-adult-
dependant/) but you may get a half-rate [ Increase for a Qualified Child (IQC)
](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/claiming-a-social-welfare-
payment/claiming-and-increase-in-your-payment-for-a-child-dependant/) .

You will qualify for a full-rate IQA and a full-rate IQC, if your adult
dependant is unemployed and signing on for credits or is earning under €100.01
per week.

If your adult dependant is earning between €100.01 and €310 per week you will
get a tapered rate of IQA and a full-rate IQC. If your adult dependant is
earning between €310.01 and €400 per week you will not get an IQA but you will
get half rate IQC. If your adult dependant earns over €400 per week you will
not get an IQA or IQC.

###  How do I get paid?

Parent's Benefit is paid directly into your bank or building society account
(a current or deposit account, not a mortgage account) or you can choose to
have it paid directly into your employer's bank account.

If your employer pays you in full while you are on parent’s leave, they may
require Parent’s Benefit to be paid directly into their bank account. You
should check your contract of employment to see what applies to you

[ Parent's Benefit is taxable (pdf) ](https://www.revenue.ie/en/tax-
professionals/tdm/income-tax-capital-gains-tax-corporation-
tax/part-05/05-05-31.pdf) . Universal Social Charge and PRSI are not payable.

of social welfare payments ](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-
system/claiming-a-social-welfare-payment/taxation-of-social-welfare-payments/)

##  How to apply for Parent's Benefit
