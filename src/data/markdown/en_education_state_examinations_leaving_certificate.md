##  What is the Leaving Certificate?

Most [ Senior Cycle ](/en/education/primary-and-post-primary-education/going-
to-post-primary-school/senior-cycle/) students choose the established Leaving
Certificate programme. This 2-year programme covers a wide range of subjects
(see ‘Leaving Certificate subjects and assessment’ below).

Subjects are normally studied at either Ordinary or Higher Level. Irish and
Mathematics can be studied at Foundation Level. Foundation Level is geared to
the needs of students who might have difficulty with subjects at Ordinary or
Higher Level.

###  Marking system for examination grades

The examination scale has 8 grades, the highest grade is Grade 1 and the

The 8-point grading scale replaced the 14-point scale at both Higher and
Ordinary levels in 2017.

Marks between 100% and 30% are divided into seven grade bands (1-7). Each band
is 10% wide.

The scheme means that the Common Points Scale used by the CAO to determine
entry into higher education institutions was also revised in 2017. You can
read more on the Department of Education’s [ Transition website
](http://www.transition.ie/) .

**Grading scale for Leaving Certificate from 2017** **New grades*** |  **% Marks**
