##  Introduction

Driver testing in Ireland is carried out by [ the Road Safety Authority (RSA)
](https://www.rsa.ie/) . You must successfully complete a driving test to get
a full Irish driving licence.

Learning to drive and passing your test can be a significant milestone.
However, the driving test can also cause stress and anxiety, and many people
are uncertain about what the test involves and how they should prepare.

###  NCT Update

You must have a valid NCT disc to sit your driving test, because one of the
requirements of a driving test is to have a roadworthy vehicle. If you have an
upcoming driving test appointment but you do not have a valid NCT, you need to
cancel your driving test through the [ MyRoadSafety portal
](https://www.rsa.ie/myroadsafety-login) . You can reschedule your test twice
without losing your fee, once you give at least 10 days’ notice.

If you're not able to get an appointment at your chosen NCT centre, you can
add your vehicle to a priority list through the [ NCT website
](https://www.ncts.ie/1230/) or phone 01 4135992. The NCT will do their best
to accommodate you with a time and date that's convenient. Your car can be
tested up to 90 days in advance of its test due date without affecting the
expiry date of the cert.

This page aims to give practical guidance and advice on driving tests in
Ireland. It includes information on:

  * What you need to take a test 
  * Applying for a test 
  * Preparing for a test 
  * What you will be tested on 
  * Appealing a test result 

##  Driving tests waiting times

Covid-19 has caused delays, so it may take some time before you will be
offered an appointment.

You will be sent an invitation to book your driving test. You can use the [
RSA’s online driving test waiting time estimator
](https://rsa.powerappsportals.com/Driving-Test-Waiting-Time-Estimator/) to
check wait times.

Appointments are prioritised as follows:

  1. **Critical frontline workers** : priority customers whose [ request for an emergency test ](https://rsa.powerappsportals.com/emergency-test-request-form/) has been accepted. 
  2. **Re-tests** : people who have failed their test and reapplied. There’s a 6 to 8 week gap between failing your test and being invited for a retest. 
  3. **Eligibility and application date** : the earlier you applied, the sooner you will get an appointment, provided you were [ eligible to sit ](https://www.rsa.ie/services/learner-drivers/the-driving-test/what-it-is) a test at the time you applied. 

When you get your booking invitation you will have 10 days to select an
appointment. If you're not ready to sit a test, that's ok, you can hold off
booking and [ re-add yourself ](https://myroadsafety.rsa.ie/home/login/1000)
to the invitation queue at a later stage.

You can get more information on how to book your driving test from the [ RSA
website ](https://rsa.ie/en/RSA/MyRoadSafety/Book-a-driving-test/) .

###

##  What do I need to take the test?

Before applying to take a driving test, you need to make sure you are eligible
to be tested. To undergo driver testing in Ireland, you must:

  * **Complete all mandatory training** . For car tests, this means you will need to have completed all 12 [ Essential Driver Training (EDT) ](https://www.rsa.ie/en/RSA/Learner-Drivers/Driver-Training/Car-Training-EDT/) sessions with an RSA Approved Driving Instructor (ADI). You can [ access details of ADIs ](http://www.rsa.ie/en/RSA/Learner-Drivers/Finding-an-instructor/Find-an-instructor/) located across the country. Similarly, to sit a motorcycle test, you will need to have completed all the [ Initial Basic Training (IBT) ](https://www.rsa.ie/en/RSA/Learner-Drivers/Motorcyclists/Initial-basic-training-IBT-for-motorcyclists/) modules appropriate to [ the category of motorcycle ](https://www.rsa.ie/road-safety/road-users/motorcyclists/motorcycle) you wish to drive. You can read detailed information on these requirements in the RSA’s [ ‘Learning to Drive’ ](https://www.rsa.ie/services/learner-drivers/resources/documents) handbook. 
  * **Hold a learner permit** . You must hold [ a learner permit ](/en/travel-and-recreation/motoring/driver-licensing/learner-driving-permits-for-cars-and-work-vehicles/) appropriate to [ the category of vehicle ](/en/travel-and-recreation/motoring/driver-licensing/categories-of-motor-vehicles-and-minimum-age-of-drivers-in-ireland/) you wish to drive. In the case of cars, motorcycles and work vehicles, you generally cannot take a driving test [ for at least 6 months ](https://www.rsa.ie/en/RSA/Learner-Drivers/Safe-Driving1/6-Month-Rule/) after getting your first learner permit. However, there are [ exceptions to this rule ](https://www.rsa.ie/help-support/online-support-centre/details/learner-permits-driving-licences/learner-permits/reduced-edt---who-can-apply-and-how-to-apply) , notably for people who hold a full licence in a country (jurisdiction) with which Ireland does not have [ a licence exchange agreement ](https://www.rsa.ie/docs/default-source/services/s1.8-learner-driver-resources/reduced-edt-information-booklet.pdf?sfvrsn=db5fc51e_0) . 
  * **Have access to a representative vehicle** . The law requires that any person attending for a driving test presents with a vehicle that is representative of the [ Licensing Category ](https://www.rsa.ie/services/learner-drivers/faq/faqs-for-motorcycle-learner-drivers) in which they wish to attain a licence to drive. The RSA has published information on [ representative vehicles for the driving test (PDF) ](https://www.rsa.ie/docs/default-source/services/s1.5-driving-test/representative-vehicles-for-your-driving-test.pdf?sfvrsn=be90ac81_3) . Your vehicle must also be in order. Your vehicle must be roadworthy, displaying valid L-plates front and rear, valid insurance and motor tax discs, and valid original [ NCT disc ](/en/travel-and-recreation/vehicle-standards/national-car-test/) if applicable. You can get detailed information on vehicle requirements in RSA’s [ ‘Checklist for Your Driving Test’ ](https://www.rsa.ie/docs/default-source/services/s1.5-driving-test/checklist-for-your-driving-test.pdf?sfvrsn=3757eef2_7) publication. 

##  How do I apply to take a test?

You can apply and pay for your test [ online at RSA.ie
](https://www.rsa.ie/en/RSA/Learner-Drivers/The-Driving-Test/Apply-online/) .
You will need a debit or credit card and a valid email address.

Alternatively, you can download [ an application form for a driving test (pdf)
](https://www.rsa.ie/docs/default-source/services/s1.5-driving-test/rsa-
driving-test-application-form.pdf?sfvrsn=a48f8280_10) and apply by post. You
can also get a copy of the relevant form from your [ local Motor Taxation
Office ](https://www.gov.ie/en/service/1fc151-find-your-local-motor-tax-
office/) .

You must send the correct fee with your completed application form. Payment
should be made online or by cheque, postal order or money order. These should
be crossed and made payable to the RSA. Fees are non-refundable.

Testing takes place at [ test centres throughout the country
](http://www.rsa.ie/Utility/Contact-Us/Driving-Test-Centres/) . Where
possible, your test will be arranged for the centre you nominate on your
application form.

[ Waiting times ](https://www.rsa.ie/services/learner-drivers/the-driving-
test/test-waiting-times) vary from county to county, so it is advisable to
apply for a test about 6 months before the expiry of your second learner
permit. The test is standard and all test centres use the same testing
procedures. See - driving tests waiting times above.

**Category of Vehicle** |  **Fee**  
---|---  
Categories A, A2, A1, B, BE, AM and W  |  €85   
All other categories  |  €120   
CPC Driving Test (Bus and Truck Category)  |  Part 1 - €120  Part 2 - €32   
  
If you need to **cancel your driving test** , you must give 10 days’ notice to
get a refund of your fee. You can [ cancel your test online
](https://www.rsa.ie/en/RSA/Learner-Drivers/The-Driving-Test/Cancel-your-
test/) using the RSA website. If you cancel more than 2 tests, you will not be
entitled to a refund and must make a new application.

##  Preparing for and taking a test

A driving test is designed to make sure that you:

  * Know the Rules of the Road 
  * Possess the knowledge and skill to drive competently in accordance with those rules 
  * Drive with proper regard for the safety and convenience of other road users 

The test lasts about 30 to 40 minutes, depending on traffic conditions. At the
beginning of the test, you will be asked technical questions about the rules
of the road, the functionality of your car, and you may also be asked to point
out different parts under the bonnet, such as how to check oil levels, or
which part is the engine.

You will then drive about five miles in a variety of road and traffic
conditions and will be examined on your practical skills.

**Preparing for your test**

To prepare for your test you should:

  * Study the RSA’s [ Rules of the Road booklet (pdf) ](https://www.rsa.ie/docs/default-source/road-safety/rules-of-the-road.pdf?sfvrsn=e0334acb_0) . This publication can also be bought in hardcopy from bookshops for a fee of €5. 
  * Read the RSA’s [ Preparing for Your Driving Test ](https://www.rsa.ie/services/learner-drivers/the-driving-test/what-it-is) . 
  * Study the RSA’s [ Learning to Drive ](https://www.rsa.ie/services/learner-drivers) for car, bike, bus and truck. 
  * Practice driving as much as possible on all types of roads and in all types of traffic situations with an ADI. 

The RSA have created a dedicated website, [ passthetest.ie
](http://www.passthetest.ie/) which provides a range of free supporting
information and [ instructional videos ](https://passthetest.ie/learning-to-
drive-videos/) about how to pass your driving test.

The RSA have also published a useful [ ‘Checklist for your Driving Test’
booklet (pdf) ](https://www.rsa.ie/docs/default-source/services/s1.5-driving-
test/checklist-for-your-driving-test.pdf?sfvrsn=3757eef2_7) to help you
prepare for the day of your test. It provides practical details about what to
expect on the day of your test and what you need to take with you to the
testing centre. You can also [ watch a video ](https://youtu.be/W4eMWyVTwfI)
of what will happen during the driving test itself.

**Technical checks**

First you will be asked some questions on the Rules of the Road. Next, if you
are doing a driving test for categories B (car), EB (car with trailer) and W
(work vehicle), you must explain some technical checks.

The instructor will bring you out to your vehicle and will ask how you would
carry out a technical check on three of the following: steering, horn, brakes,
tyres, lights, reflectors, indicators, engine oil, coolant, and windscreen
washer fluid. To get access to some of these parts, you will have to show how
to open the bonnet and close it securely. The RSA has more detailed
information on [ technical checks for all motor vehicles
](https://www.rsa.ie/road-safety/road-users/car-drivers/car-maintenance) .

If you are doing a test for categories C1, C, EC1 and EC (truck and trucks
with trailers), you will be asked how you would carry out a technical check on
three of the same items above. To get access to some of these parts, you may
have to open and securely close the bonnet and certain panels. You can [
access detailed information ](https://www.rsa.ie/services/professional-
drivers/cpc/become-a-professional-cpc-driver) about getting a Certificate of
Professional Competence (CPC) for buses and trucks on the RSA website.

**Practical test of skills**

The practical part of your test will take approximately 30 minutes to
complete. The examiner will give you clear instructions throughout the test,
but if you don’t understand something, ask them to repeat it.

Do not panic if you make a mistake during the test. It may not be as serious
as you think and it may not mean you have failed.

You will be assessed in the following situations:

  * Moving off 
  * Driving in traffic 
  * Stopping 
  * Reversing round a corner 
  * Performing a turnabout 
  * Performing a hill start 
  * Parking 

The aspects of your driving that will be assessed include:

  * Road positioning 
  * Overtaking and passing 
  * Anticipation and observation 
  * Use of mirrors and signals 
  * Progress 
  * Speed 
  * Compliance with traffic lights 
  * Road signs and road markings 
  * Proper use of your vehicle controls 

You can also expect to make a number of left and right turns, encounter a
roundabout and stop at traffic lights. At some point during your test, the
examiner will ask you to demonstrate hand signals.

**Getting your result**

When you return to the test centre, your examiner will bring you back into the
examination room to give you the result. [ If you pass
](https://www.rsa.ie/en/RSA/Learner-Drivers/The-Driving-Test/After-you-pass/)
, you will be given a Certificate of Competency, which is valid for 2 years.
Once you have this certificate, you can apply for a full driving licence. If
you do not apply for a full licence during the 2 year period, you will have to
take your driving test again.

It is important to note, however, that a Certificate of Competency is not a
licence, and a driver holding one cannot drive on a motorway, remove their ‘L’
plates or drive unaccompanied until they possess their full licence. A person
granted a first full driving licence must also display ‘N’ plates on their
vehicle for a period of 2 years.

If you fail your driving test, you will be given a detailed list of your
mistakes. You should study the list and work on the mistakes before you [ sit
another driving test ](https://www.rsa.ie/en/RSA/Learner-Drivers/The-Driving-
Test/Repeating-your-test/) . You will automatically get an invitation for
another test in 6-8 weeks.

##  Motorcycle driving tests

The motorcycle test is similar to that for cars and work vehicles. The RSA
recommend that you prepare for your motorcycle test by studying the [ Rules of
the Road booklet (pdf) ](https://www.rsa.ie/docs/default-source/road-
safety/rules-of-the-road.pdf?sfvrsn=e0334acb_0) and by practise riding as much
as possible on all types of roads and in all types of traffic situations.

You can access [ detailed information on the motorcycle test
](https://www.rsa.ie/services/learner-drivers/the-driving-test/driving-test-
vehicles/motorcycle) and the motorcycle licencing system on the RSA website.
The RSA have also produced [ several instructional videos
](https://www.rsa.ie/en/RSA/Learner-Drivers/Motorcyclists/Learning-to-drive-
videos/) to support learner riders in preparing for a test.

**Technical checks**

Before you begin the practical test of skills, the examiner will check your
technical knowledge of the motorcycle. You will be asked how a technical check
on 3 parts of your motorcycle would be performed. This can include, tyres,
steering, brakes, chain, reflectors, indicators, lights (including dipping the
headlight), oil level and emergency stop switch (if fitted).

You will also be asked to put the machine off (and back on) its stand (or
side-stand). You will also be asked to move the motorcycle approximately 5
metres forward or backwards with the engine off.

**Practical test of skills**

You will be given clear instructions before your test on the route to take.
The driver tester will be following you in a car or motorcycle. In exceptional
circumstances, i.e., very heavy traffic congestion, the tester may observe you
on foot.

Motorcycle tests will be carried out using radio controls. You will be given
the radio equipment and advice on how to use it at the test centre.

  * You will be assessed in the following situations: 
  * Moving off 
  * Riding in traffic 
  * Riding left-hand circuits 
  * Riding right-hand circuits 

You will also be required to do a U-turn within the width of the road to
demonstrate that you have good control of your motorcycle in a confined space.

You will then be asked to ride slowly, at "walking pace" for around 50 metres
to demonstrate that you have adequate control of your vehicle.

**Getting your result**

When you return to the test centre, your examiner will bring you back into the
examination room to give you the result. If you fail your motorcycle test, you
will be given a detailed list of your mistakes and must apply to take the test
again at a later date.

If you pass, you will be given a Certificate of Competency, which is valid for
2 years. A Certificate of Competency is not a full licence and it does not
entitle you to drive on a motorway or to carry a pillion passenger. If you
fail to apply for a full licence during this 2 year period, you will have to
take your driving test again.

##  If English is not your first language

**Tests in the Irish language**

You can apply for your driving test to be conducted through Irish. To do this,
complete the [ Irish language version of the application form (pdf)
](https://www.rsa.ie/docs/default-source/services/s1.5-driving-test/rsa-
driving-test-application-form-\(irish\).pdf?sfvrsn=2b7e830f_5) and submit it
as normal.

**Tests for non-English speakers**

If English is not your first language, you may have an interpreter go with you
for the first part of the test where you answer questions on the Rules of the
Road and carry out technical checks. However, your interpreter cannot be your
driving instructor and they cannot go with you on the practical part of the
test.

##  Tests for people with a disability

You should notify the RSA’s [ Driver Testing Section
](https://www.rsa.ie/help-support/if-you-need-to-contact-us) in advance if
you:

  * Have a severe hearing problem 
  * Are restricted in your movements or have any disability which could affect your driving 
  * Drive an adapted vehicle 

This will ensure you don’t face any delays on the day of your test. Most
driving test centres in Ireland are wheelchair accessible, but you should
contact your selected centre in advance of your test to confirm this. You
should also note that if the vehicle you use for the test is adapted to suit a
disability (e.g., it has additional controls), this [ will be recorded on your
full driving licence ](https://www.rsa.ie/services/learner-drivers/the-
driving-test/how-to-apply) .

Drivers with a disability are tested to the same standard and in the same way
as other drivers, but the test is conducted by a specially trained examiner
familiar with the techniques of disabled driving. You can access useful
information on driver assessment and instruction from the [ Disabled Drivers
Association of Ireland (DDAI) website ](https://www.ddai.ie/) .

You can request to be tested on your knowledge of the Rules of the Road in
your vehicle, rather than in the test centre, if you wish. If you have a
hearing impairment, an interpreter can assist you with answering questions on
the Rules of the Road. However, your interpreter must not be your driving
instructor and they cannot go with you on the practical part of your test.

If you have a disability, or if you are deaf or hard of hearing, you will be
given a little longer to go through the practical test of skills. However,
this does not mean you are allowed to drive more slowly during your test; you
need to maintain the same progress on the road as all other drivers in line
with [ national speed limits ](/en/travel-and-recreation/roads-and-
safety/road-traffic-speed-limits-in-ireland/) .

##  Appealing your test result

If you are not satisfied with the results of your driving test, [ it is
possible to appeal ](https://www.rsa.ie/services/learner-drivers/the-driving-
test/repeating-your-test) . Appeals against driving test results are [ heard
in the District Court ](/en/justice/courts-system/district-court/) by a judge
sitting alone, without a jury.

To begin appeal proceedings, you must lodge your appeal with your local [
District Court Office ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/justice/courts-
system/district-court/) for [ a fee of €25 ](https://www.courts.ie/district-
court-fees) .

No financial compensation is available in driving test appeal cases. You will
not get any compensation for any costs associated with either failing your
test or in taking the appeal. A District Court judge can only make one of two
decisions in a driving test appeal case:

  * Your appeal is refused. The judge agrees with the decision of the driving tester that you failed your test. 

Or

  * Your appeal is upheld. The judge is satisfied that your driving test was not conducted properly. You will then be offered another driving test, free of charge. If the judge directs another test to be carried out, the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport must arrange to have it conducted by another tester.
