##  Introduction

This page explains how to apply for your first [ Irish passport ](/en/travel-
and-recreation/passports/irish-passports-an-overview/) if you are over 18.

If your previous passport was issued when you were a child and has not yet
expired (or has only recently expired), your application is considered a [
renewal application ](/en/travel-and-recreation/passports/renewing-an-irish-
passport/) and not a first-time application.

Adult passports are valid for 10 years. If your last passport was issued over
15 years ago, you will have to apply as if you were a first-time applicant.

The Passport Service strongly recommends that you apply for your passport at
least 8 weeks before your travel date if you are applying by post and at least
20 days if you apply online.

The [ latest turnaround times
](https://www.ireland.ie/en/dfa/passports/turnaround-times/) are available on
the Passport Service's website. If you need to send documents, the processing
time will only start when the Passport Office receives them. **Applying online
is the quickest way** to get a new passport.

You can apply for your first Irish passport:

  * Online, through Passport Online 
  * By post, through Post Passport 

You can also get more information on [ replacing a lost or stolen passport
](/en/travel-and-recreation/passports/replacing-a-lost-or-stolen-irish-
passport/) and [ how to renew your passport ](/en/travel-and-
recreation/passports/renewing-an-irish-passport/) .

##  Passport Online service

You can use the [ Passport Online
](https://www.ireland.ie/en/dfa/passports/passport-online/) service to apply
for your first Irish passport from anywhere in the world.

You need access to a printer for your first passport application. You must
give an email address. You must also be able to pay by credit or debit card.
You will have to send original documents to the Passport Service after you
have completed the online application form.

###  Digital photographs

You must include a digital photo as part of your online application.

You can do this in 3 ways:

  * Have your photo taken at a participating photo provider, who will give you a unique code to include with your online application. 
  * Have your photo taken at a photo provider, and ask them to email it to you, or save the photo on a USB device, or another storage method. You must have access to the photo when completing your online application. 
  * Take a photo at home using a digital camera or smartphone. This cannot be a “selfie” and you should not use the zoom function of your camera. The photo must capture your image from the waist upwards. 

You can read more about the [ photo requirements for the Passport Online
service ](https://www.ireland.ie/en/dfa/passports/photo-guidelines/) .

###  Proving your identity

  * When your online application is completed, you will be asked to print an Identity Verification Form. 
  * If you are applying in Ireland, a member of the Garda Síochána must sign this form. 
  * If you are applying outside Ireland, the form can be witnessed by a person in one of the [ occupations listed on the Passport Online site ](https://www.ireland.ie/en/dfa/passports/how-to-get-your-application-witnessed/) , or on the verification form itself. 

###  Sending documents

Once the application is completed, you will be asked to print an Application
Cover Page. This will list the documents you have to send to the Passport
Service. All documents sent must be original. The Passport Service recommends
that you use a secure method of postage for sending your documents. A postage
label is generated as part of your application (if you are applying in
Ireland).

If you are applying outside Ireland, you should use a reliable postal service.
In some countries, the local postal services are not reliable. In this case,
you can submit your documents to your nearest Irish Embassy.

You can read more about the documents you may need to send below.

You can read [ Frequently Asked Questions
](https://www.ireland.ie/en/dfa/passports/faqs/) about the extended Passport
Online service.

##  Applying by post through Post Passport

[ Post Passport ](https://www.anpost.com/Government-Services/Post-Passport) is
a service provided by An Post.

If you are an Irish citizen living in Ireland, you should fill in form APS 1.
You will find this form at Garda stations and any post office. It is not
currently possible to download the paper application form.

###  Photographs

You must include 4 recent identical photographs of yourself with your
application. Two of these photographs should be signed on the back by the
person [ who witnesses the application
](https://www.ireland.ie/en/dfa/passports/how-to-get-your-application-
witnessed/) . The witness should also write the form number shown in Section 9
of the application form on the two signed photographs. If you are applying for
your passport in Ireland the witness must be a member of the Garda Síochána.

You can get more [ detailed information on passport photographs.
](https://www.ireland.ie/en/dfa/passports/photo-guidelines/)

###  Post Passport abroad

There are several [ UK Post Office branches in Northern Ireland that provide
the Post Passport service (pdf)
](https://www.dfa.ie/media/dfa/howtogetapassportpdfs/nipx-list-16-nov-07-for-
website.pdf) .

The following post offices in the UK also offer Post Passport:

  * Cardiff Post Office, 83 - 85 Queen Street, Cardiff, CF10 2NX 
  * Glasgow Post Office, 140 West Nile Street, Glasgow, G1 2RD 
  * Liverpool Post Office, 1 – 3 South John Street, Liverpool, L1 8BNI 

If you are applying abroad, the application form lists suitable categories of
witnesses. The witness should enter their daytime contact number on the
application form as this may need to be verified by the Passport Service or
the relevant embassy or consulate.

##  Applying in person

Applying in person to the Passport Office for your first passport is not
recommended. Nearly all Irish citizens can apply for their first passport
online.

The counter service in the Passport Office is designed to accommodate people
who need to [ renew their passports urgently
](https://www.ireland.ie/en/dfa/passports/urgent-appointment/) and don’t have
enough time to apply in other ways. It should not be used for first-time
applications. These applications are too complex to be processed at the public
counter because your right to Irish citizenship must be established and your
documents must be verified. You should not book any travel until you have
received your passport as these applications cannot be expedited.

If you are living abroad, in a country where Post Passport or Passport Online
are not available, you can apply for an Irish passport in person or using
ordinary or registered post to your [ nearest Irish embassy or consulate
](https://www.ireland.ie/en/dfa/embassies/) . You use form APS 2.

You cannot download the application form. You can get the application form
from the Irish embassy or consulate in the country where you live (or the
closest embassy or consulate).

](https://www.ireland.ie/en/dfa/passports/turnaround-times/)

###  Tracking the progress of your application

The Passport Service provides a [ Passport Tracking Service
](https://www.ireland.ie/en/dfa/passports/tracking/) . This service lets you
check the status of your application online. You must have the application
number from your form to use this service (this number is in the top left-hand
corner of the application form).

###  Signing the passport

When you receive your passport, you should sign it. If it is a child’s
passport, the child should sign it. If the child is not able to sign their
name, it should be left blank.
