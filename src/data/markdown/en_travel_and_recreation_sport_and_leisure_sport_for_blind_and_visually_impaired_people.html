##  Introduction

###  Vision Sports Ireland

Vision Sports Ireland is the national governing body in Ireland for sporting
activities for blind and visually impaired people. The organisation was
founded in 1988 to encourage participation in sports by blind and visually
impaired people at all levels. The organisation has an executive committee and
a constitution that outlines the rules and guidelines under which the
activities are undertaken. Funding for Vision Sports Ireland comes from Sport
Ireland.

Sports are conducted at all levels (including elite). Each sport undertaken by
the organisation has its own principal coordinator who is responsible for
promoting and organising activities within that sport. In recent years, the
organisation has significantly expanded the [ range of sports
](https://visionsports.ie/get-active/sport/) it has become involved in. See
the [ FAQs ](https://visionsports.ie/about/about-us/) for more information
about Vision Sports Ireland.

Membership consists of people of all ages, backgrounds and sporting abilities
(including the elite athletes). Sighted people can also become members of the
organisation.

###  Volunteers, coaches, and guides

In addition to being participants in sports, sighted members often act as
guides and volunteers. [ Volunteers ](https://visionsports.ie/support-
us/become-a-volunteer/) , coaches and guides form an integral part of Vision
Sports Ireland.
