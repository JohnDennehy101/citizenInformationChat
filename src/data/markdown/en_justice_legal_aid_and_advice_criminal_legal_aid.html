##  What is criminal legal aid?

If you are accused of a crime and cannot afford [ legal representation
](/en/justice/criminal-law/criminal-trial/legal-representation-in-criminal-
cases/) , you can apply to get criminal legal aid from the State.

You have a constitutional right to legal advice in criminal cases, including
the right to legal representation where you cannot afford to pay for it. The
main legal aid available to someone accused of a crime is the legal aid
provided under the [ Criminal Justice (Legal Aid) Act 1962
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1962/en/act/pub/0012/index.html) .

###  **Legal aid certificate**

If a judge grants you criminal legal aid, you will be issued a [ legal aid
certificate ](/en/justice/legal-aid-and-advice/criminal-legal-aid-
certificates/) to cover any costs associated with preparing your defence and
going to court.

If you are not granted a legal aid certificate, you may be able to get free
legal representation through another scheme (see ‘Other legal aid schemes’
below).

**Proposed changes to criminal legal aid**

The Department of Justice has [ proposed reforms
](https://www.gov.ie/en/press-release/36768-means-tested-criminal-legal-aid-
can-be-withdrawn-or-cut-from-applicants-under-reforms-from-ministers-mcentee-
and-browne/) for criminal legal aid under the [ General Scheme of the Criminal
Justice (Legal Aid) Bill 2023 (pdf)
](https://www.gov.ie/pdf/?file=https://assets.gov.ie/263924/c32b1cc8-6c6b-4112-a505-48cd3cb73b96.pdf#page=null)
. This page will be updated as more information becomes available.

##  The difference between criminal and civil legal aid

Criminal legal aid and [ civil legal aid ](/en/justice/legal-aid-and-
advice/civil-legal-advice-and-legal-aid/) are separate services.

Criminal legal aid is:

  * For [ criminal offences ](/en/justice/criminal-law/criminal-offences/) , like murder, rape, theft, or serious road traffic offences 
  * Granted by the courts 
  * Free, and paid for by the State 

Civil legal aid is:

  * For [ civil matters ](/en/justice/civil-law/) , like claims for damages or family disputes 
  * Provided by the [ Legal Aid Board ](/en/justice/legal-aid-and-advice/legal-aid-board/)
  * Not free and requires [ minimum contributions ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/justice/legal-aid-and-advice/civil-legal-advice-and-legal-aid/#l62fd2) , except in certain circumstances 

##  What costs are covered by criminal legal aid?

Criminal legal aid covers any fees, costs or expenses for preparing and
conducting your defence. This includes the fees of a [ solicitor
](/en/justice/courtroom/solicitors/) and, in certain circumstances, up to [ 2
counsel or barristers ](/en/justice/courtroom/barristers/) .

Criminal legal aid can also cover the cost of going to trial, appealing a
conviction, or getting a case stated (where the judge refers a question of law
to a higher court).

If your solicitor or barrister thinks the services of non-legal professionals
or experts are necessary to help prepare your defence, legal aid also covers
these fees.

Examples of non-legal professionals or experts include:

  * Doctors 
  * Psychiatrists 
  * Engineers 
  * Forensic scientists 
  * Language experts 

You can read more about the [ different types of criminal legal aid
certificates ](/en/justice/legal-aid-and-advice/criminal-legal-aid-
certificates/) .

##  How to apply for criminal legal aid

You can apply for legal aid in person on the day you attend court, or by
writing to the Court Registrar. Criminal cases start in either the [ District
Court ](/en/justice/courts-system/district-court/) or in some cases, the [
Special Criminal Court ](/en/justice/courts-system/special-criminal-court/) .

If you have been accused of a crime and attend court without legal
representation, the court should make you aware that you may be entitled to
criminal legal aid.

If you already have a solicitor, they can apply on your behalf, but they must
be on the [ Criminal Legal Aid Panel ](https://www.courts.ie/legal-aid) to be
covered by the scheme (see ‘Can I choose my solicitor?’ below).

###  **Telling the court about your means**

You will need to explain your financial situation to the judge so they can
assess your means.

You may be asked to complete a statement of means that sets out your income,
family circumstances and other relevant details. The District Court clerk at
the District Court offices can give you this form.

If you are a young person, the court will look at the means of your parents or
guardian to see if they can afford to pay for legal advice.

The judge may ask the prosecuting Garda if [ the Gardaí ](/en/justice/law-
enforcement/garda-siochana-national-police-force/) object to legal aid being
granted. They rarely object unless they have proof that you are being
untruthful to the court about your means.

###  **Fales statements to the court**

When applying for legal aid, it is an offence for you to knowingly:

  * Make a false statement or representation to the judge, either verbally or in writing 
  * Conceal any important fact from the judge 

If you are found guilty of this offence, you could be fined €2,500 (a [ class
C fine ](/en/justice/criminal-law/criminal-trial/fines-for-criminal-offences/)
) or be sent to prison for up to 6 months (or both).

For example, if you tell a judge that you are unemployed and you are then
given legal aid, but it transpires that you were employed at the time, you are
guilty of an offence.

If you have a query about the granting of criminal legal aid, you should [
contact the Court Clerk or Court Registrar
](https://www.courts.ie/offices.nsf/webcobycounty?OpenView&Start=1&Count=30&Collapse=7#7)
for the court you are appearing in.

##  Do I qualify for criminal legal aid?

There are no eligibility guidelines for criminal legal aid. Instead, the judge
must decide if you qualify.

When deciding if you qualify, the judge considers:

  * Whether you can afford to pay for your own legal advice 
  * How serious the charge is 

If you have been charged with murder, or if your appeal is from the [ Court of
Criminal Appeal to the Supreme Court
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/justice/courts-system/court-of-
appeal/#5d81b4) , the judge only considers whether you can afford to pay for
your own legal advice.

If the charge is not serious, the judge may still grant legal aid in
exceptional circumstances. This includes circumstances where you:

  * Are very ill 
  * Are immature 
  * Lack any formal education 
  * Are emotionally disturbed or lack the mental capacity to understand the process of the court case 

###  **Does legal aid carry across all courts?**

Legal aid granted in a court applies only to matters that concern that court.
For example, legal aid granted in the [ District Court ](/en/justice/courts-
system/district-court/) only covers District Court proceedings.

If the District Court sends your case to a higher court to be dealt with and
you were already granted free legal aid, you will need to make a new
application for legal aid to the higher court.

A higher court is unlikely to refuse to grant a legal aid certificate if the
District Court granted you one for the same matter.

###  **Can I choose my solicitor?**

If you are granted criminal legal aid, you are assigned a solicitor from the
criminal legal aid panel.

If you tell the court that you wish to be represented by a particular
solicitor, the judge will assign that person to you so long as they are on the
legal aid panel and are available.

If the judge refuses to assign your nominated solicitor, they must give a
reason why and they should ask if you wish to nominate a different solicitor.

####  **Criminal legal aid panel**

[ Solicitors ](/en/justice/courtroom/solicitors/) and [ barristers
](/en/justice/courtroom/barristers/) are not legally obligated to take part in
the criminal legal aid scheme. The legal aid panel includes solicitors and
barristers who are willing to take part in the scheme.

[ The Courts Service ](https://www.courts.ie/legal-aid) maintains a list of
solicitors included in the scheme. The [ Bar Council
](https://www.lawlibrary.ie/) nominates barristers who are willing to take
part in the scheme.

##  When is criminal legal aid not granted?

Criminal legal aid is normally not granted in the following circumstances:

  * Where the judge decides that the charge is not serious enough (for example, [ minor offences ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/justice/criminal-law/criminal-offences/classification-of-crimes-in-criminal-cases/#l73512) ) 
  * Where the judge decides that you can afford to pay for your own legal advice 
  * Extradition proceedings 
  * Most [ judicial review ](/en/government-in-ireland/how-government-works/standards-and-accountability/judicial-review-public-decisions/) proceedings 

If you are not granted criminal legal aid, you may in some cases be able to
apply for free legal representation under another scheme (see ‘Other legal aid
schemes’ below).

##  Can I appeal if I am refused legal aid?

You cannot appeal if you are refused criminal legal aid.

However, if the matter is sent forward for hearing to a higher court, you can
make a new application in the higher court. The judge will consider the
application in the same way as your original application (see ‘Do I qualify
for criminal legal aid?’ above).

##  Other legal aid schemes

If you were not granted criminal legal aid, you may be able to get free legal
representation under another scheme.

These other schemes are administered by the [ Legal Aid Board
](/en/justice/legal-aid-and-advice/legal-aid-board/) .

###  **Legal Aid – Custody Issues Scheme**

The Legal Aid – Custody Issues Scheme covers fees for a solicitor and
barrister to represent you in certain criminal matters if you cannot afford to
pay the fees yourself.

The scheme covers:

  * Applications for bail in the [ High Cour ](/en/justice/courts-system/high-court/) t, [ Court of Appeal ](/en/justice/courts-system/court-of-appeal/) or the [ Supreme Court ](/en/justice/courts-system/supreme-court/)
  * Judicial review proceedings about criminal matters or matters where the liberty of the person is at issue 
  * Applications under the [ Extradition Act 1965 ](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1965/en/act/pub/0017/index.html) and the [ European Arrest Warrant Act 2003 ](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2003/act/45/enacted/en/html)
  * Habeas Corpus applications (where a person claims that they are being unlawfully detained by the State) 

To qualify for the scheme, you must demonstrate to the court that you cannot
afford legal representation, and the court must recommend your case to the
Legal Aid Board for the scheme.

The scheme is not an alternative to costs, so you or your legal representative
must apply to the court at the start of the proceedings. You should get legal
advice to see if you are eligible for the scheme.

You can [ read more about the Legal Aid – Custody Issues Scheme
](https://www.legalaidboard.ie/en/lawyers-and-experts/legal-professionals-in-
criminal-legal-aid-ad-hoc-cases/legal-aid-custody-issues-scheme/) on the Legal
Aid Board website.

###  **Criminal Assets Bureau Ad-Hoc Legal Aid Scheme**

The Criminal Assets Bureau Ad-Hoc Legal Aid Scheme provides legal aid if you
are a defendant in a court case brought by the [ Criminal Assets Bureau
](https://www.cab.ie/) and cannot afford legal representation.

The scheme covers:

  * Court proceedings under the [ Proceeds of Crime Act 1996 ](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1996/en/act/pub/0030/index.html) , Revenue Acts or Social Welfare Acts 
  * Social welfare appeals made to the [ Circuit Court ](/en/justice/courts-system/circuit-court/) under Section 307 of the [ Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005 ](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2005/en/act/pub/0026/index.html)
  * Tax appeals made to the Circuit Court under the Taxes Acts where the Criminal Assets Bureau is the respondent 
  * Applications made by the [ Director of Public Prosecutions ](/en/justice/law-enforcement/director-of-public-prosecutions/) under Section 39 of the [ Criminal Justice Act 1994 ](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1994/en/act/pub/0015/index.html)

To qualify for the scheme, you must demonstrate to the court that you cannot
afford legal representation. If the court grants the scheme, they will make an
order.

The scheme is not an alternative to costs, so you or your legal representative
must apply to the court at the start of the proceedings. You should get legal
advice to see if you are eligible for the scheme.
