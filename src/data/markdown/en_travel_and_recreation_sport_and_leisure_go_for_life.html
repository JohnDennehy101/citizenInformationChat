##  Go for Life programme

Go for Life is the national programme for sport and physical activity for
older people (aged over 50 years). The programme aims to encourage older
people in all aspects of sport and physical activity. It is run by [ Age &
Opportunity ](https://ageandopportunity.ie/) in partnership with the [ Health
Promotion and Improvement Offices ](https://www.healthpromotion.ie/) of the [
Health Service Executive (HSE) ](/en/health/health-system/health-service-
executive/) and the [ Local Sports Partnerships
](https://www.sportireland.ie/participation/lsp-contact-finder) .

This page gives an overview of the Go for Life programme and the National
Grant Scheme.

promote greater participation by independent older people in physical activity
and recreational sports. Go for Life has trained over 1000 volunteers who act
as Physical Activity Leaders (PALs) for older people. PALs tend to be members
of community groups, such as active retirement associations or day centre
workers.

games usually take place over one day in June.

the community to participate in sports and physical activity.

The scheme is aimed at:

  * Helping clubs and organisations to enhance existing opportunities for their members in recreational sports and activities.
