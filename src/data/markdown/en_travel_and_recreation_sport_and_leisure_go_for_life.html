##  Go for Life programme

Go for Life is the national programme for sport and physical activity for
older people (aged over 50 years). The programme aims to encourage older
people in all aspects of sport and physical activity. It is run by [ Age &
Opportunity ](https://ageandopportunity.ie/) in partnership with the [ Health
Promotion and Improvement Offices ](https://www.healthpromotion.ie/) of the [
Health Service Executive (HSE) ](/en/health/health-system/health-service-
executive/) and the [ Local Sports Partnerships
](https://www.sportireland.ie/participation/lsp-contact-finder) .

This page gives an overview of the Go for Life programme and the National
Grant Scheme.

###  Physical Activity Leaders (PAL)

The [ PAL programme ](https://ageandopportunity.ie/sport/pals/) aims to
promote greater participation by independent older people in physical activity
and recreational sports. Go for Life has trained over 1000 volunteers who act
as Physical Activity Leaders (PALs) for older people. PALs tend to be members
of community groups, such as active retirement associations or day centre
workers.

###  Go for Life Games

The [ Go for Life Games ](https://ageandopportunity.ie/sport/goforlife-games/)
promote greater participation in recreational sports for older people. The
games are supported by Local Sports Partnerships and the HSE. The sport can be
played in singles, pairs, and teams to encourage participation and fun. The
games usually take place over one day in June.

###  Go for Life - FitLine

[ Go for Life FitLine ](https://ageandopportunity.ie/active/fitline/) is a
telephone-based service that encourages you to get more active. You can speak
with a Go for Life mentor on Freephone 1800 303 545.

###  CarePALs Workshops

The Physical Activity Awareness Programme aims to increase older peopleâ€™s
awareness of the benefits of an active lifestyle and the wide range of
opportunities for involvement in active living and recreational sports.
Further information is available from [ Age and Opportunity
](https://ageandopportunity.ie/sport/carepals/) .

##  The National Grant Scheme

The [ National Grant Scheme ](https://ageandopportunity.ie/active/age-and-
opportunity-active-national-grant-scheme/) for Sport and Physical Activity for
Older People is a government initiative aimed at encouraging older members of
the community to participate in sports and physical activity.

The scheme is aimed at:

  * Helping clubs and organisations to enhance existing opportunities for their members in recreational sports and activities. 
  * Helping clubs and organisations to progress new initiatives geared at involving older people in recreational sports and activities. 

Applications for funding under the National Grant Scheme are usually invited
from local clubs and organisations wishing to implement initiatives through
advertisements in the press and media.
