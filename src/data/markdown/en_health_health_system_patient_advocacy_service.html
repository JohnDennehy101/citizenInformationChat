executive/) (HSE) provides publicly funded health and social care services.
The Patient Advocacy Service is fully independent of the HSE.

PAS can support you in making a complaint to the HSE using the HSE complaints
system, [ Your service your say ](https://www2.hse.ie/services/hse-complaints-
and-feedback/your-service-your-say.html) .

acute hospital, use the PASâ€™s [ step-by-step guide on how to complain to the
HSE ](https://www.patientadvocacyservice.ie/how-to-complain/step-by-step/) .

nursing home, the Patient Advocacy Service has a [ step-by-step guide on how
