  * What is the Patient Advocacy Service? 
  * How can PAS support me? 
  * Complaints about a HSE acute public hospital 
  * Complaints about a nursing home 
  * Patient safety incidents 
  * More information 

##  What is the Patient Advocacy Service?

You can get independent, free and confidential information, advice, advocacy
and support to make a complaint about certain health services from the [
Patient Advocacy Service (PAS). ](https://www.patientadvocacyservice.ie/)

PAS can also support you with a patient safety incident (see below).

###  What kind of complaints does PAS support?

PAS can advise and support you to make a complaint about your experience in a:

  * HSE-funded [ public acute hospital ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/health/health-services/gp-and-hospital-services/hospital-services-introduction/#10a26f)
  * Nursing home 

##  How can PAS support me?

The PAS website explains [ how to make a complaint
](https://www.patientadvocacyservice.ie/faq/how-do-i-complain/) , including
what you should include in your complaint, and how to write it.

If you make a complaint, the Patient Advocacy Service can also explain your
options if there is a delay with the complaint or if you are not satisfied
with the outcome.

You can get support by phoning the Patient Advocacy Service helpline, on 0818
293003.

You can also visit the [ PAS website ](https://www.patientadvocacyservice.ie/)
for information and a [ contact form
](https://www.patientadvocacyservice.ie/patient-advocacy-service-queries/) .

##  Complaints about a HSE acute public hospital

The [ Health Service Executive ](/en/health/health-system/health-service-
executive/) (HSE) provides publicly funded health and social care services.
The Patient Advocacy Service is fully independent of the HSE.

PAS can support you in making a complaint to the HSE using the HSE complaints
system, [ Your service your say ](https://www2.hse.ie/services/hse-complaints-
and-feedback/your-service-your-say.html) .

###  **How to make a complaint about HSE public acute hospital**

If you want to make a complaint about your experience in a HSE-funded public
acute hospital, use the PASâ€™s [ step-by-step guide on how to complain to the
HSE ](https://www.patientadvocacyservice.ie/how-to-complain/step-by-step/) .
The guide also explains when to expect a response.

PAS can also give information and support to help you with the complaints
process. [ Read more on the PAS website.
](https://www.patientadvocacyservice.ie/how-to-complain/faqs/)

##  Complaints about a nursing home

###

If you want to make a complaint about your experience in a public or private
nursing home, the Patient Advocacy Service has a [ step-by-step guide on how
to complain about a nursing home ](https://www.patientadvocacyservice.ie/step-
by-step-pac/) , and when to expect a response at each stage.

PAS can also give information and support to help you with the complaints
process. [ Read more on the PAS website
](https://www.patientadvocacyservice.ie/how-to-complain-faqs-nursing-homes/) .

**2022 expansion of PAS**

Since 1 November 2022, the Patient Advocacy Service can also advise and
support you with [ complaints about private nursing homes
](https://www.gov.ie/en/press-release/948fb-minister-for-mental-health-and-
older-people-continues-to-drive-forward-the-reform-of-care-for-older-people/)
.

##  Patient safety incidents

If you experience or could have experienced an unintended or unexpected injury
or harm when you received healthcare, this is called a patient safety
incident.

You are entitled to independent advocacy support from PAS if you experience a
patient safety incident through an investigation process.

You can read more about patient safety incidents and the implementation of the
[ Open Disclosure Framework
](https://www.gov.ie/pdf/?file=https://assets.gov.ie/273442/1b63c986-f080-4c78-86e2-3e3d2a16fd22.pdf#page=null)
from the HSE.
