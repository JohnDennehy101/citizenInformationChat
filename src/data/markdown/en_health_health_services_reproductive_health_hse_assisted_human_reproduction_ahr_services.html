#  HSE Assisted Human Reproduction services

  * Introduction 
  * Accessing the free HSE Assisted Human Reproduction service 
  * Who can get free AHR services from the HSE? 
  * More information 

##  Introduction

Getting pregnant can be a challenge for some people. You can read our overview
page about [ fertility treatments and assisted human reproduction
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/birth-family-relationships/before-
your-baby-is-born/fertility-treatments-and-dahr/) in Ireland.

[ Since 25 September 2023 ](https://www.gov.ie/en/press-
release/c2e96-minister-for-health-announces-full-funding-for-assisted-human-
reproduction-treatment-from-september/) , you can access free assisted human
reproduction services (including IVF) from the Health Service Executive (HSE)
at a HSE-approved private fertility clinic of your choice. Free fertility
treatment through the HSE is not means tested.

To access the publicly funded treatment, you must first consult with your GP.

If eligible, they may refer you for fertility assessment at a Regional
Fertility Hub. After assessment, they may refer you to the publicly funded
assisted human reproductive treatment (see steps below).

If you are not eligible for this service, your family doctor (GP) may refer
you to a private specialist or clinic, or you may be able to contact a clinic
directly for an appointment.

###  What assisted reproduction treatments are available from the HSE?

The free treatments available from the HSE include:

  * Intrauterine insemination (IUI) 
  * In vitro fertilisation (IVF) 
  * Intracyctoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) 

You can find more detailed information in the [ HSE Assisted Human
Reproduction Services Information Booklet.
](https://www.hse.ie/eng/about/who/acute-hospitals-division/woman-
infants/national-fertility-services/assisted-human-reproduction-services-
information-booklet.pdf)

##  Accessing the free HSE Assisted Human Reproduction service

###  **Step 1: Referral to Regional Fertility Hub**

If you have fertility difficulties, you must meet certain criteria to get a
referral from your GP or consultant to a Regional Fertility Hub. You cannot
refer yourself.

Regional Fertility Hubs are based in certain public maternity hospital
networks across the country ( [ Regional Fertility Hub locations
](https://www2.hse.ie/pregnancy-birth/trying-for-a-baby/your-fertility/using-
fertility-services/) ). Regional Fertility Hubs provide tests and treatments
for both males and females (see below).

To get a referral from your GP or consultant to a Regional Fertility Hub, you
must:

  * Have problems getting pregnant or a health problem that affects fertility 
  * Be aged under 43 if you are a woman or aged under 60 if you are a man 
  * Have a BMI (body mass index) of 18.5 to 35 if you are a woman 

Read the [ HSE information booklet on Regional Fertility Hubs (pdf).
](https://www.hse.ie/eng/about/who/acute-hospitals-division/woman-
infants/national-fertility-services/regional-fertility-hub-information-
booklet.pdf)

####  Questionnaires for the Regional Fertility Hub

When the Regional Fertility Hub gets your referral, the fertility team will
send you a male and a female questionnaire to complete and return. There can
be a waiting list for an appointment in a Regional Fertility Hub.

An appointment will not be issued until your questionnaires are completed and
returned to the fertility team in the regional fertility hub.

You can find [ examples of the questionnaire on the HSE website
](https://www.hse.ie/eng/about/who/acute-hospitals-division/woman-
infants/national-fertility-services/) .

###  **Step 2: Tests at the Regional Fertility Hub**

If you referred to the Regional Fertility Hub, they will provide specific
tests for you both, including:

  * Relevant blood tests 
  * Specialised pelvic ultrasound scans 
  * Semen analysis 

You do not have to pay for these tests if you are referred to the Regional
Fertility Hub, but you may have to pay for any medicine you are prescribed,
visits and tests with your GP.

Find out [ what to expect at a Regional Fertility Hub
](https://www2.hse.ie/pregnancy-birth/trying-for-a-baby/your-fertility/expect-
regional-fertility-hub/) .

###  **Step 3: Appointment with a consultant**

The reproductive medicine consultant at the Regional Fertility Hub will review
your medical test results, all your medical history and discuss your treatment
options.

If you are applying as a couple, you must both attend this appointment.

Depending on the results of your tests, your consultant may recommend:

  * Medical treatments such as timed intercourse or ovulation induction 
  * Surgery (for women or for men) 
  * Assisted conception treatment, including IUI, ICSI and IVF 

###  **Step 4: Consent and choosing an AHR clinic**

If you have been identified as requiring assisted human reproduction treatment
and you meet the criteria (see below) for free treatment from the HSE, you
will be given [ a HSE consent booklet for Assisted Human Reproduction Services
](https://www.hse.ie/eng/about/who/acute-hospitals-division/woman-
infants/national-fertility-services/assisted-human-reproduction-services-
consent-booklet.pdf) .

In the consent handbook, you can read about what services are included and
what are not. To access AHR services you must:

  * Choose your top 3 preferred private fertility clinics from the list of private HSE-approved fertility private providers 
  * Complete the consent form and return it to the Regional Fertility Hub 

###  **Step 5: Referral to a HSE approved private AHR clinic**

The Regional Fertility Hub will send your medical history and test results to
the private AHR clinic.

Your private AHR clinic will prescribe you medicine as part of your fertility
treatment plan. You will not have to pay for this medicine if you have a [
medical card ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/health/medical-cards-and-
gp-visit-cards/medical-card/) . If you do not have a medical card, you may be
able to get some of your medicine covered by the [ Drugs Payment Scheme
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/health/drugs-and-medicines/drugs-
payment-scheme/) card.

You can read more about the processes of IVF, ICSI and IUI on our page about [
fertility treatments and assisted human reproduction in Ireland.
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/birth-family-relationships/before-
your-baby-is-born/fertility-treatments-and-dahr/)
