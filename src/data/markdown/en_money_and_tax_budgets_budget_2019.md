##  Brexit preparations

Measures to prepare for Brexit, including the possibility of a “no-deal”
Brexit, are being put in place across government departments. Funding of over
€110 million has been allocated to Brexit measures. These include:

**Agriculture, Food and the Marine:** a package to address challenges arising
from Brexit in the farm and food sectors, including funding for Bord Bia to
support Brexit-related promotion and development work, investment in food
innovation facilities, and investment in food companies to improve
productivity and competitiveness.

**Business, Enterprise and Innovation:** loans under a new Future Growth
Scheme to allow businesses (including farmers) to make strategic investments
after Brexit; expanding the global footprint of enterprise agencies to take
advantage of opportunities that may arise from Brexit; IDA property investment
in further regional locations; strengthening and resourcing of the Office of
the Director of Corporate Enforcement; and resourcing the Local Enterprise
Offices to help fund local and indigenous enterprises to meet the challenge of
Brexit.

**Foreign Affairs and Trade:** extra resources to the Passport Service to meet
rising demand, including Brexit-specific increases; developing a whole-of-
Government Brexit Preparedness Communications Plan; increasing support to
organisations that promote reconciliation and understanding between
communities in Northern Ireland, and between North and South; and ongoing
implementation of the Global Ireland Initiative.

**Transport, Tourism and Sport:** programme to support the tourism industry,
help prepare it to address the impact of Brexit and grow alternative markets
in the context of Brexit and a decline in UK visitors.

**Education and Skills:** upskilling and reskilling for sectors and regions
most vulnerable to Brexit.

##  Taxation

###  Income tax

The threshold for the higher rate of income tax (40%) will increase by €750.
This means, for example, an increase from €34,550 to €35,300 for single
individuals and an increase from €43,550 to €44,300 for married couples with
one earner (from 1 January 2019).

The **Home Carer Tax Credit** will increase from €1,200 to €1,500.

The **Earned Income Tax Credit** for self-employed people will increase from
€1,150 to €1,350.

Revenue’s **updated PAYE system** will be fully operational from 1 January
2019.

###  VAT

The VAT rate for the tourism sector will increase from 9% to 13.5% (from 1
January 2019).

The rate for newspapers and sporting facilities will continue at 9%. The VAT
rate for e-books and electronically supplied newspapers will be reduced from
23% to 9% (from 1 January 2019).

###  Local Property Tax (LPT)

A review of the Local Property Tax is currently underway and an update will be
provided later this year.

###  Universal Social Charge (USC)

The 4.75% rate of USC will reduce to 4.5%.

The ceiling of the 2% band will increase from €19,372 to €19,874, so that the
salary of a full-time worker on the minimum wage will remain outside the
higher rates of USC.

Incomes of €13,000 or less will continue to be exempt from USC in 2019. Once
your income is over this limit, the following rates will apply (from 1 January
2019):

  * €0 to €12,012 @ 0.5% 
  * €12,012 to €19,874 @ 2% 
  * €19,874 to €70,044 @ 4.5% 
  * €70,044+ @ 8% 
  * Self-employed income over €100,000: 3% surcharge 

The weekly income threshold for the higher rate of employer’s PRSI will
increase from €376 to €386 to ensure that there is no incentive to reduce the
working hours for a full-time employee on the increased minimum wage.

###  Capital Acquisitions Tax (CAT)

The Group A tax-free threshold, which applies primarily to gifts and
inheritances from parents to their children, will be increased from €310,000
to €320,000. This increase applies to gifts or inheritances received on or
after 10 October 2018.

###  Stamp duty

The exemption for young trained farmers from stamp duty on agricultural land
transactions continues for another 3 years to the end of 2021.

##  Excise duties

###  Tobacco products tax

From midnight on 9 October 2018, the excise duty on a packet of 20 cigarettes
will increase by 50 cent (including VAT) with a pro-rata increase on other
tobacco products. There will be an additional 25 cent on roll-your-own
tobacco.

There is an increase in the minimum excise duty on tobacco products, so that
all cigarettes sold below €11 have the same excise applied as those sold at
€11 and above.

###  Betting duty

The duty on bets placed by customers in the State will increase from 1% to 2%
for bookmakers, and from 15% to 25% on the commissions earned by betting
intermediaries.

##  Social welfare

The total social protection budget in 2019 will be €20.5 billion.

###  Increases in social welfare payments

The maximum rate of all **weekly social welfare payments** will increase by €5
per week with proportional increases for qualified adults and people on
reduced rates of payment. This also applies to **employment programmes** such
as Community Employment (CE), Tús and the Rural Social Scheme (from week
beginning 25 March 2019).

People aged 25 and under who are getting **a reduced rate of Jobseeker’s
Allowance** will get the full €5 increase (from week beginning 25 March 2019).

The weekly **rate for a qualified child** will increase by €2.20 from €31.80
to €34 for children under 12 years of age. It will increase by €5.20 from
€31.80 to €37 for children aged 12 years and over (from week beginning 25
March 2019).

###  Christmas Bonus

A Christmas Bonus of 100% will be paid in December 2018 to people getting a
long-term social welfare payment (minimum payment of €20). (December 2018)

###  Parental Benefit

A new scheme will be introduced providing 2 weeks’ Parental Benefit for
insured employees and self-employed people. It will be paid at the same rate
as Maternity Benefit and Paternity Benefit (from November 2019).

###  Self-employed people

Jobseeker’s Benefit will be extended to self-employed people (late 2019).

###  One-parent families

The earnings disregard for the **One-Parent Family Payment** and the
**Jobseeker’s Transition payment** will increase by €20 per week, from €130 to
€150 per week (from 28 March 2019).

###  Working Family Payment

A maintenance disregard of €95.23 per week for housing costs, with the
remainder assessed at 50%, will be introduced for the Working Family Payment
to bring it in line with other social assistance schemes.

###  Back to School Clothing and Footwear Allowance

The Back to School Clothing and Footwear Allowance will increase by €25 per
child, from €125 to €150 for children aged 4-11 and from €250 to €275 for
children aged 12-22 in full-time second-level education.

###  Fuel Allowance

extra week will apply to the current fuel season.

###  Domiciliary Care Allowance

Domiciliary Care Allowance will continue to be paid for 3 months in cases
where the child being cared for has died (from 1 January 2019).

###  Cost of disability

(from week beginning 25 March 2019).

###  Employer’s PRSI

The weekly threshold for employer’s PRSI will increase from €376 to €386 (from
1 January 2019).

The National Training Fund Levy (NTFL), collected alongside Employer PRSI for
Classes A and H, will increase by 0.1% from 0.8% to 0.9% (from 1 January
2019).

###  Community Employment

Additional funding of €2 million for materials will be made available in
2019\.
