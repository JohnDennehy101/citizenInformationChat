  * Contact details for support services 

##  Immediate aftermath

If you are bereaved by suicide, you may experience a range of emotions
including shock, disbelief, guilt, and anger. As suicide may occur
unexpectedly or be very sudden, this makes it traumatic for those left behind.

Some people bereaved by suicide may start to have suicidal thoughts
themselves. If you or somebody you know who has been bereaved by suicide
experience this, please reach out for help to a family member or friend, or to
one of the organisations listed below.

##  Practical matters

Even though this is an extremely difficult time, you may have concerns about
practical matters which arise after someone close to you dies.

[ Bereavement - a practical guide (pdf)
](https://www.citizensinformationboard.ie/downloads/guides/Bereavement_Guide_2023.pdf)
is a guide to some of these practical concerns and sets out information such
as:

  * What to do immediately after a death 
  * Possible social welfare entitlements 
  * Tax, financial and legal issues that can arise 
  * Where to go for further information and support 

##  Supporting someone bereaved by suicide

If you are supporting someone who has been bereaved by suicide, it is
important to be extremely sensitive to the needs of the bereaved person. Each
situation involving suicide is different and people react in different ways.

It is also important to be mindful of your own mental wellbeing while offering
support to the bereaved. The organisations listed below can help, particularly
if a time comes when you can no longer offer the level of support needed.

These organisations can offer you advice, information and support during this
very distressing time. Some organisations run support groups that can put you
in touch with other people that have been through this experience.

services/nosp/resources/reachoutsuicidepreventionstrategy.pdf) .

The NOSP supports the implementation of the current national strategy, [
