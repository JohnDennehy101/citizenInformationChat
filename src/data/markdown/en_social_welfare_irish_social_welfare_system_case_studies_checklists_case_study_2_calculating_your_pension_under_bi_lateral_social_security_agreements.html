#  Case study: Calculating your pension under bilateral social security
agreements

  * Case study 

##  Case study

###  This is an example showing how your entitlement to State Pension
(Contributory) is calculated under bilateral social security agreements.

###  Case study

Mary worked in Ireland for just over 11 years and has 600 Irish contributions.
She has spent the last 23 years working in the US and has 1,200 contributions
paid there. In total she has worked for 34 years since first entering
insurable employment.

She will be 66 next month and has returned to Ireland to retire. She wants to
know if she will qualify for the [ State Pension (Contributory) ](/en/social-
welfare/older-and-retired-people/state-pension-contributory/) when she is 66
years of age.

####  **Step 1**

First, you must check whether Mary would qualify for an Irish State Pension
based on her Irish contributions alone.

You can calculate this by dividing the total number of contributions (600) by
the total number of years worked (34) since entering insurable employment.

**Yearly average number of contributions calculation** Mary’s Irish contributions  |  600   
---|---  
Total number of years worked*  |  34   
Yearly average number of contributions  |  600 ÷ 34 = 17.65 **(round up to 18)**  
  
* since entering into insurable employment to the end of the last complete tax year before reaching pension age 

Mary's yearly average number of contributions is 18. She would qualify for a
reduced Irish State Pension (Contributory) of €180.70 (in 2024).

####  **Step 2**

Second, you must calculate Mary’s 'notional rate of pension'. This is the rate
of State Pension Mary would be entitled to if all her contributions were
assessed as Irish contributions.

You can calculate this by dividing the total number of contributions, both
Irish and foreign (1,800), by the total number of years worked since entering
insurable employment (34).

**Yearly average number of contributions calculation** Total assessable contributions  |  600 Irish contributions + 1,200 US contributions = 1,800   
---|---  
Total number of years worked*  |  34   
Yearly average number of contributions  |  1,800 ÷ 34 = **52.9**  
  
*since entering insurable employment to the end of the last complete tax year before reaching pension age 

Mary’s yearly average number of contributions is 52.9. You need a yearly
average of 48 contributions to get the maximum State Pension (Contributory).

As Mary has more than enough contributions, her notional rate of pension is
the same as the maximum rate of State Pension (Contributory), which is €277.30
(in 2024).

**Step 3**

Third, you calculate what pension Mary would get under bilateral security
agreements. You do this by applying the following formula:

  * (A x B) ÷ C = rate of State Pension 

**Figures for pension calculation** A = Notional rate of pension (calculated in step 2)  |  €277.30   
---|---  
B = Number of Irish contributions  |  600   
C = Total number of contributions (Irish and foreign)  |  1,800   
  
First, you multiply the notional rate of pension (A) by the total number of
Irish contributions (B):

  * €277.30 x 600 = €166,380 

Then, you divide €166,380 by the total number of Irish and foreign
contributions (C):

  * €166,380 ÷ 1,800 = €92.43 

Mary’s rate of State Pension (Contributory), calculated under bilateral
security agreements, is €92.43.

**In this case Mary would be better off claiming a State Pension based on her
Irish contributions alone rather than one calculated under bilateral social
security agreements.**
