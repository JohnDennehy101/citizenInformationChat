##  Introduction

**Primary legislation** is law that is passed by the Oireachtas (the Irish
parliament). Under the Constitution of Ireland, the Oireachtas is the only
institution of the Irish State that can make laws.

Legislation starts as a Bill. The bill must be passed by the Dáil and the
Seanad (the two Houses of the Oireachtas – the Irish parliament) before the
President can sign the bill into law. When it is signed by the President, the
Bill becomes an Act and is added to the Statute Book.

Bills must pass through a number of stages before they are voted on by the
members of the Oireachtas.

**Secondary legislation** includes Statutory Instruments and bye-laws. An Act
of the Oireachtas may delegate the power to enact secondary legislation to
another body – for example, a Minister or a local authority. The secondary
legislation must be consistent with the delegated powers permitted by the Act.

##  Stages of legislation

A Bill may begin (be _commenced_ ) in either the Dáil or the Seanad but it
must be passed by both Houses to become law. Usually, Bills are commenced in [
Dáil Eireann ](/en/government-in-ireland/houses-of-the-oireachtas/dail-
eireann/) . Money Bills (for tax or spending by the Government) or Bills to
amend the Constitution cannot be commenced in the [ Seanad ](/en/government-
in-ireland/houses-of-the-oireachtas/the-seanad/) .

Bills are either commenced by a Minister of State (Government Bills) or by a
TD or Senator who is not part of the Government (Private Member’s Bills). Once
it is drafted, a Bill must go through 5 stages before it becomes law.

###  Drafting of the Bill

Sometimes, the Government publishes a _Green Paper_ before it drafts a Bill. A
Green Paper is a discussion document setting out ideas and inviting comment
and views from individuals and relevant organisations.

The ‘general scheme’ of the Bill is often published and sometimes undergoes
pre-legislative scrutiny by an Oireachtas Committee. The Committee may invite
representatives of groups who will be affected by the Bill to meet and discuss
the Bill.

A Private Member’s Bill is only scrutinised by an Oireachtas Committee if it
passes the second stage in the Dáil (see ‘Second stage’ below).

###  First stage

The Bill is initiated. How this works differs depending on who is introducing
the Bill:

  * A Government Minister or the Leader of the Seanad can introduce a Bill and it automatically passes to the second stage 
  * Groups of 7 TDs or 5 Senators can introduce a Bill and it automatically passes to the second stage if certain criteria are met 
  * Any one TD or any three Senators can seek leave to introduce a Bill and whether it proceeds will be voted on by the House. 

###  Second stage

The Bill is put before the House (either the Dáil or the Seanad, depending on
where the Bill was commenced) for a general debate on the principles of the
Bill. Members of the House may make suggestions for amendments and additions.
The House decides if the Bill should pass this stage and move on the Committee
Stage.

###  Third stage – Committee Stage

Next, each individual section of the Bill is debated. This is often carried
out by an Oireachtas Committee in the Dáil. Members discuss proposed
amendments with the relevant Minister. The Minister decides on whether to
accept or reject an amendment. If an amendment is rejected by the Minister, a
vote can then be called.

The Committee State can be lengthy because there is no limit on the number of
times a member can speak on an amendment.

###  Fourth state – Report Stage

This is the last opportunity for amendments to the Bill. Members can only
speak twice on each amendment, and their second speech is limited to two
minutes. No new amendments can be added by members outside the Government –
only amendments from Committee Stage are discussed.

The Government can add new amendments at the Report Stage, but only by
returning the Bill to Committee Stage.

###  Fifth Stage

This usually follows directly from the Report Stage. The House (either the
Dáil or Seanad) where the Bill was commenced, votes on the Bill.

If the Bill is passed, it then moves to the next House (if it commenced in the
Dáil, it now moves to the Seanad) where it goes through all 5 stages again.
Amendments made in the second House can be rejected by the first House after a
debate.

The Seanad has only 21 days to consider money bills.

##  The President and legislation

Once the Bill has been passed by both Houses, the Taoiseach presents a copy of
the Bill to [ the President ](/en/government-in-ireland/houses-of-the-
oireachtas/president-introduction-to-the-president-of-ireland/) for signature.
Once the President has signed the Bill it becomes an Act. Some Acts require a
commencement order or orders before they have full legal force.

If the President considers that the new Bill may conflict with the [
Constitution ](/en/government-in-ireland/irish-constitution-1/constitution-
introduction/) , they may, after consultation with the Council of State, refer
the [ question of the Bill’s constitutionality ](/en/government-in-
ireland/how-government-works/standards-and-accountability/unconstitutional-
legislation-and-decisions/) to the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court must then
decide whether the Bill is constitutional. If the Supreme Court finds that the
Bill, or any part of the Bill, is unconstitutional, the President cannot sign
it into law.

##  Secondary legislation

Some Acts of the Oireachtas allow for regulations to be made by a Minister,
local authority, or some other body, to add details about how a particular
provision will operate in practice. These regulations are secondary
legislation. A Minister makes regulations by signing a Statutory Instrument
(SI). Local authorities pass bye-laws to make regulations for their local
authority areas.

###  Statutory Instruments

The majority of laws that are introduced each year are Statutory Instruments,
rather than Acts of the Oireachtas. In 2020, there were 32 Acts of the
Oireachtas signed into law, and 760 Statutory Instruments.

An SI is signed by a Minister under the powers given to the Minister by the
principal Act of the Oireacthas.

For example, [ Section 17 of the Immigration Act 2004
](https://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2004/act/1/section/17/enacted/en/html)
says that the Minister for Justice can make an order requiring that citizens
of certain countries need a visa to enter Ireland. Using their power under
this Section, the Minister signed [ SI 473 of 2014
](https://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2014/si/473/made/en/print) (Immigration
Act 2004 (Visas) Order 2014) setting out the countries whose citizens need a
visa.

The Minister can sign an SI into law without needing to pass a Bill through
the Houses of the Oireacthas. But the SI cannot exceed the powers that are
granted by the governing Act of the Oireachtas. The courts may strike down a
law because the Minister has acted _ultra vires_ (beyond their legal
authority).

###  EU Law

It is common for the Government to use Statutory Instruments to transpose [ EU
Directives ](/en/government-in-ireland/european-government/eu-law/how-eu-law-
works/) into Irish law.

###  Commencement orders

Sometimes, an Act (or particular sections of an Act) does not come into force
immediately. Instead, it needs the Minister to sign a ‘commencement order’.
This is done by way of Statutory Instrument.

###  Bye-laws

Local authorities have powers under Acts of the Oireachtas to pass bye-laws
for their local areas. These are often used to regulate:

  * Parking zones and parking fines 
  * Litter control 
  * The control of horses and dogs
