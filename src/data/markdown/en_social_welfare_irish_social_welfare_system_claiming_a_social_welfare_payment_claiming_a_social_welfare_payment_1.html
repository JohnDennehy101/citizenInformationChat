##  Introduction

The Department of Social Protection has a range of social welfare payments
that provide financial support. To get a social welfare payment, you must
apply for it. So, if you think you are entitled to a payment you should always
apply.

Your first step before applying, is to find out which payment you may be
entitled to.

Payments are available for:

  * [ People who are unemployed ](/en/social-welfare/unemployed-people/)
  * [ Families and children ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/social-welfare-payments/families-and-children/payments-to-families-and-children/)
  * [ Widows, widowers and surviving civil partners ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/social-welfare-payments/death-related-benefits/)
  * [ Guardians or orphans ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/social-welfare-payments/death-related-benefits/)
  * [ Older and retired people ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/social-welfare-payments/older-and-retired-people/)
  * [ People with a disability ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/social-welfare-payments/disability-and-illness/)
  * [ Carers ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/social-welfare-payments/carers/)

If you get a social welfare payment you may also qualify for [ extra social
welfare benefits ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-
welfare/social-welfare-payments/extra-social-welfare-benefits/) .

####  Household Budget Scheme

If you get certain social welfare payments, you can put a regular amount
towards your household bills using the [ Household Budget Scheme
](https://www.anpost.com/Money/At-the-Post-Office/Household-Budget) . For
example, telephone, gas, electricity, and local authority rent.

##  Rules

To apply for a social welfare payment, you must fill in an application form
and provide other supporting documentation. The information and documents you
must submit depend on the payment and your personal circumstances. However, in
general you must submit some documents when you apply for a payment.

If you apply for, or are currently getting a social welfare payment (including
Child Benefit) you may be asked to register for a [ Public Services Card
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-
system/public-services-card/) .

####  **Adult and child dependents**

If you qualify for a payment, you may be able to get an increase in your
payment for an [ adult dependant
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-
system/claiming-a-social-welfare-payment/claiming-an-increase-in-your-social-
welfare-payment-for-an-adult-dependant/) or a [ child dependant.
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-
system/claiming-a-social-welfare-payment/claiming-and-increase-in-your-
payment-for-a-child-dependant/) If it is possible to claim for dependants, the
Department of Social Protection will ask for information about your dependants
on the application form.

####  **How long to process claims**

It may take some time for the Department to process your claim. As part of the
procedure, you may be interviewed in your home or asked to attend an interview
at your local social welfare office.

While your claim is being processed by the Department, you may qualify for [
Supplementary Welfare Allowance ](/en/social-welfare/supplementary-welfare-
schemes/supplementary-welfare-allow/) .

####  **Late claims**

It is important that you make your claim as soon as you know you are entitled
to the payment. All payments must be claimed within a specific period of time.
If you don't claim on time you may lose out. Find out more about [ making a
late claim ](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/claiming-a-social-
welfare-payment/making-a-late-claim/) .

####  Further information or documents

If you are asked to provide information reasonably required by a social
welfare inspector when investigating your claim, you must provide the
statements, information or documents within 21 days. The same time period
applies to your spouse, civil partner, cohabitant, employer and certain other
people (for example, landlords).

If you are refused a social welfare payment or get a lesser amount than you
expected, you have 21 days to [ appeal the decision of the Department of
Social Protection ](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/social-
welfare-appeals/) .

There is more information about how the Department makes decisions on claims
in 'More information' below.  

##  How to apply

You must complete the application form and provide supporting documents.

You can apply for most payments online. You can also get an application form
from your local [ Intreo Centre or Social Welfare Branch Office
](https://www.gov.ie/en/directory/category/e1f4b5-intreo-offices/) or your [
local Citizens Information Centre ](http://centres.citizensinformation.ie/) .
You can also get an [ application
](https://www.gov.ie/en/collection/a9ac9-social-welfare-application-forms/)
form on gov.ie.

Your Intreo Centre, Social Welfare Branch Office or your local Citizens
Information Centre can help you fill in your application form.

**Birth certs for social welfare**

You are no longer required to provide copies of birth certificates for social
welfare purposes if you were born in Ireland and your birth is in the Register
of Births. The Department of Social Protection can access this information
directly.

You can get more information about getting a [ Birth, Marriage or Death
certificate ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/birth-family-
relationships/getting-birth-marriage-or-death-certificate/) .  

##  Where to apply

  * Apply online at [ MyWelfare.ie ](https://www.mywelfare.ie/Account/Login) (only certain payments)

##  Further information

###  How social welfare decisions are made  

Deciding Officers are employed by the Department of Social Protection to
accept or reject claims made in Ireland for social welfare payments. Deciding
officers are given the power to make these decisions through the Social
Welfare Consolidation Act 2005 as amended and other social welfare
legislation.

Before making a claim or applying for a social welfare payment you must
complete the application form. The application form will ask for various
details, such as your name, address, PPS number, income etc. These details
will help the Department of Social Protection to process your application and
if your claim is successful, to arrange your payment.

As part of the application process, you must also provide supporting
documentation to prove that the information you have given on the application
form is correct. For example, a payslip to show your employment income.

To qualify for a social welfare payment, you must meet all the qualifying
criteria for that payment. Different social welfare payments have different
qualifying criteria. It is your responsibility to prove to the Department that
you qualify for the payment you have applied for.

If you are applying for a payment due to an illness or disability your doctor
must fill in part of the application from. If you are in work, your employer
may have to fill in a part of the form.

####  **What happens when I send my application?**

When you send your application form to the Department of Social Protection, it
will be assessed to make sure that it is correctly completed and that you have
sent all the required documents.

At this point, the Department may request more information from you or ask you
to attend a medical examination to find out if you qualify for the payment you
applied for. For example, if you apply for Disability Allowance you may be
asked to attend for a medical examination. If this is the case, the doctor's
report stating whether you meet the medical criteria is sent to the person at
the Department of Social Protection who is responsible for making a decision
on your claim.

####  **What does a Deciding Officer do?**

When the Department has all the information it needs, a Deciding Officer will
examine your claim and will either accept or reject your claim for the social
welfare payment you applied for. The Deciding Officer must apply the law as
set out in Social Welfare Acts, Statutory Instruments, and relevant Department
guidelines, circulars and other regulations when making a decision on your
claim. If your claim is approved, the Deciding Officer will determine the rate
of your payment.

A Deciding Officer must record their decision on your claim in writing.
Generally, if your application for a payment has been successful you will get
a letter stating this. If your application is rejected, the Deciding Officer
must give you a letter in writing stating your claim has been rejected and the
reasons for this decision.

If you have been awarded less than the maximum rate of payment, you must get a
letter stating the reasons for this.

It is useful to know the reason or reasons why a deciding officer rejected
your claim or awarded you less than the maximum rate of payment, especially if
[ you wish to appeal their decision
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-
system/social-welfare-appeals/) .
