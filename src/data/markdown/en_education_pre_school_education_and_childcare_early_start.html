##  What is the Early Start Pre-School Programme?

The Early Start Pre-School Programme is a one-year pre-school programme
offered in selected schools in some disadvantaged areas.

Early Start is for children aged between 3 and 5 years who are at risk of not
reaching their potential in school.

A child may either be enrolled in Early Start or in the [ Early Childhood Care
and Education (ECCE) Scheme ](/en/education/pre-school-education-and-
childcare/early-childhood-care-and-education-scheme/) . They cannot be
enrolled in both schemes at the same time.

You can get [ a list of the schools in the Early Start Programme
](https://www.gov.ie/en/service/78ff8-early-start-programme/) on the
Department of Education website.

##  Early Start staff

The Early Start Pre-School Programme is staffed by fully qualified primary
school teachers and childcare workers.

###

**Parental involvement**

Parents are encouraged to become involved in the planning and organising of
activities.

The Early Start staff work with the school's [ Home School Community Liaison
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/education/primary-and-post-primary-
education/attendance-and-discipline-in-schools/home-school-liaison/) Co-
ordinator to encourage parents to take part in the centre's activities
