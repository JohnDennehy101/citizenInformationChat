  * Do I qualify for BISS? 
  * How does the BISS scheme work? 
  * What are payment entitlements? 
  * How do I apply for BISS? 
  * More information about BISS 

##  What is the Basic Income Support for Sustainability Scheme?

The Basic Income Support for Sustainability Scheme (BISS) is the main EU
support for farmers. It provides income support for farming sustainably and
aims to ensure farmers can make a living from farming.

The amount you get is based on the number of hectares you farm that qualify
for the scheme.

The Basic Income Support for Sustainability Scheme replaced the Basic Payment
Scheme (BPS).

**The Basic Income Support for Sustainability Scheme is currently closed to
new applicants. It will open again in 2025.**

##  Do I qualify for BISS?

To qualify for BISS, you must:

  * Have at least one [ eligible hectare ](https://control.citizensinformation.ie/en/environment/land/basic-income-support-for-sustainability-scheme-for-farmers/#239535) . Each eligible hectare is worth one BISS payment entitlement. 
  * Have a registered herd number or have applied for a herd number before the application deadline 
  * Be an [ active farmer ](https://www.gov.ie/pdf/?file=https://assets.gov.ie/266405/318c630d-b5f7-48a6-bcf9-4f5332d6863a.pdf#%5B%7B%22num%22%3A142%2C%22gen%22%3A0%7D%2C%7B%22name%22%3A%22XYZ%22%7D%2C69%2C720%2C0%5D)

**What is an active farmer?**

An active farmer is a person that manages or farms land.

To be considered an active farmer, you must:

  * Have a minimum stocking rate of 0.10 livestock units per hectare (the equivalent of at least one ewe per hectare) 
  * Be involved in other farming activities, for example, producing crops, cutting hay or silage, topping 

You do not have to own the land to qualify for BISS, but you must have control
over it, for example, by leasing or renting it.

##  How does the BISS scheme work?

You get [ payment entitlements
](https://control.citizensinformation.ie/en/environment/land/basic-income-
support-for-sustainability-scheme-for-farmers/#d8d011) based on the amount of
land you farm. You claim these entitlements to get financial support.

To qualify, you need to have at least one eligible hectare of land.

Eligible hectares are automatically calculated using the best imagery
available and are displayed on the BISS online system. You do not have to
manually calculate the number of eligible hectares you have.

###  **What is an eligible hectare?**

An eligible hectare is an **agricultural area** of land, one hectare in size
that is used for **agricultural activity** .

Agricultural areas that qualify as eligible hectares are:

  * Arable land, which is land used for crop production 
  * Permanent crops, which is land that is repeatedly harvested 
  * Permanent grassland, which is land used to grow grasses, heather or rushes 
  * Agroforestry, which is land used for agriculture and growing trees 
  * Paludiculture, which is the use of wet and rewetted peatlands that are close to their natural permanently wet state for different types of wetland agriculture and forestry 

These areas must be used for agricultural activity to qualify as eligible
hectares. Agricultural activity includes producing agricultural products, such
as livestock or growing crops. It can also include maintaining agricultural
areas, for example, by cutting hedges or mulching.

**What if there are other features on my land?**

An eligible hectare should be primarily used for agricultural activity, but it
can also include other features and still qualify.

For example, an eligible hectare may also have:

  * Hedgerows, hedgerow encroachment or scrub (the average width of the hedge must be less than 7 metres and no individual bulges can be more than 12 metres) 
  * Trees in a line which must be mainly deciduous 
  * Drains 
  * Ponds (less than 0.2 hectares) 
  * Archaeological sites and monuments 
  * Designated habitats 
  * Other landscape features, such as stone walls 

Your land also qualifies for BISS even if half of it is not used for
agricultural activity, but instead is covered with ‘beneficial features’.

###  **What are beneficial features?**

A beneficial feature is a feature which has environmental benefit to the land.

Beneficial features can make up to 50% of a land parcel without affecting the
eligibility of the land for BISS. If they take up more than 50% of the land
parcel, the amount of support you get will be reduced.

This can include features which encourage and support:

  * Biodiversity 
  * Habitat retention 
  * Space for nature 
  * Carbon sequestration (removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere) 

Beneficial features include:

  * Scrub 
  * Trees 
  * Woodland 
  * Rock 
  * Habitat 

**Note** : Different rules apply to areas in the Burren and the Aran Islands,
which are unique karst limestone regions.

###  **What areas of land do not qualify for BISS?**

Non-agricultural areas do not qualify for BISS entitlement payments.

Non-agricultural areas include:

  * Artificial areas such as roads, paths, buildings, farmyards, quarries 
  * Waterways such as streams, lakes, and ponds greater than 0.2 hectares 
  * Sand either from a beach or foreshore 
  * Areas used mainly as sports fields, golf courses or pitch and putt courses 
  * Solar panels and wind turbines 
  * Bog parcels 
  * Horse lunging or jumping areas, horse gallops based on sand 
  * Glasshouses or polytunnels with non-earthen solid floors 
  * Abandoned land, for example, land that has no agricultural activity or is not maintained 

If you have non-agricultural areas in land which is otherwise suitable for
BISS, they will be deducted from the eligible land.

##  What are payment entitlements?

The amount of financial support you get is based on your payment entitlements.

You get 1 payment entitlement for 1 eligible hectare of land. But, the value
of each payment entitlement can vary depending on:

  * The payment rates you got on previous direct payment schemes 
  * Any allocations you received from the [ National Reserve ](https://www.gov.ie/en/service/5b7788-national-reserve-new-entrant-category/) as a young or new farmer 
  * Adjustments made each year to move the value of entitlements towards a national average (convergence). See [ BISS 2024 Terms and Conditions (pdf) ](https://www.gov.ie/pdf/?file=https://assets.gov.ie/266405/318c630d-b5f7-48a6-bcf9-4f5332d6863a.pdf%22%20\\l%20%22page=null) for more information. 

The average value of a BISS payment entitlement in 2024 is €154.64.

You can check the value of your entitlements on your agfood.ie account.

These entitlements must be used in 2 years. If you do not use your
entitlements within this period, you will lose them to the [ National Reserve
](https://www.gov.ie/en/service/5b7788-national-reserve-new-entrant-category/)
.

Gov.ie has [ more information on BISS entitlements
](https://www.gov.ie/en/service/3f1f2-transferring-farm-entitlements/) ,
including how to transfer your payment entitlements to another farmer.

**What is convergence?**

The BISS scheme is moving to a national average for the value of payment
entitlements. This means gradually increasing lower payment entitlements and
decreasing higher payment entitlements.

###  **How much can I get?**

The maximum amount you can get in one year is €66,000.

The minimum is €100.

##  How do I apply for BISS?

**The Basic Income Support for Sustainability Scheme is currently closed to
new applicants. It will open again in 2025.**

When applications open, you apply for BISS at [ agfood.ie ](http://agfood.ie/)
.

If you do not have an account, you can set one up on the website.

You can also apply for other farming schemes and grants with your BISS
application.

You can find [ guides and video tutorials on how to complete the application
](https://www.gov.ie/en/service/4ae67-basic-income-support-for-sustainability-
biss-scheme/#biss-help-guides-and-videos) on gov.ie.

###  **Need help applying?**

You can get a Farm Advisory System (FAS) approved advisor to apply for BISS
and other farming grants for you. A FAS advisor is someone who is qualified to
give farmers advice on a range of topics, including applying for grants and
schemes. You will have to pay the FAS advisor for this service.

You can find [ a farm advisor ](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/b41a6-farm-
advisory-system/?referrer=https://www.gov.ie/farmadvisor/#find-a-farm-advisor)
on gov.ie.

###  **When was the deadline?**

The deadline for applications for BISS 2024 was midnight 15 May 2024 and late
applications were accepted until 10 June 2024.

###  **Changes to your application after the deadline**

You can make certain changes to your application after the deadlines without
having to pay a late fee. These changes include:

  * Withdrawing land 
  * Reducing the claimed area of a parcel 
  * Changing the use of a parcel from eligible to ineligible (for example, transferring a house site) 

You will have to pay a late fee for these changes if:

  * The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine informs you of issues with your 2024 BISS application 
  * You are notified about an on-the-spot inspection and it shows non-compliance with the parcels you are changing 
  * You have received payments under the BISS scheme for 2024 

See [ BISS 2024 Terms and Conditions (pdf)
](https://www.gov.ie/pdf/?file=https://assets.gov.ie/266405/318c630d-b5f7-48a6-bcf9-4f5332d6863a.pdf#page=null)
