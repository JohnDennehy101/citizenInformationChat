##  What is the Afforestation Scheme?

The Afforestation Scheme provides financial support to encourage people to
develop and manage sustainable forests. You don't have to be a farmer to
apply.

The aim of the scheme is to increase Ireland’s forest cover from 11% to 18% by
2027 to help counteract climate change. Planting trees is one way to reduce
the effects of climate change, as trees and forests absorb greenhouse gases.

The Afforestation Scheme runs from 2023 to 2027. Under the scheme, you can
plant different types of forests depending on the type of land you have. The
amount of money you get depends on the size and type of forest you plant.

##  Do I qualify for the Afforestation Scheme?

To qualify for the scheme and get the payments, you must meet these criteria:

  * You must be over 18 
  * You must have a [ Personal Public Service Number (PPSN) ](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/personal-public-service-number/) or a company registration number (CRN) if you’re applying for a company 
  * You must own, lease or be a joint manager of the land you plan to plant on when you apply. You must have documents to prove this. There are exceptions to this rule in certain circumstances. 
  * You must follow the rules of the scheme 
  * You must establish and maintain a type of forest that is covered by the scheme 

##  What forest types are covered by the scheme?

There are 12 different types of forests that qualify for the scheme.

  * FT1 – Native forests 
  * FT2 – Forests for water 
  * FT3 – Forest creation on public lands 
  * FT4 – [ NeighbourWoods ](https://www.gov.ie/en/service/2c9879-neighbourwood-scheme/)
  * FT5 – Emergent forest and rewilding 
  * FT6 – Broadleaf (mainly oak and beech trees) 
  * FT7 – Diverse broadleaf 
  * FT8 – Agroforestry 
  * FT9 – Seed orchards 
  * FT10 – Continuous cover forestry (CCF) 
  * FT11 – Mixed high forests: diverse Conifer, minimum 20% broadleaves 
  * FT12 – Mixed high forests with Sitka Spruce, minimum 20% broadleaves 

You can find information on what can be planted for each forest type in the [
Afforestation Scheme 2023-2027 Document (pdf).
](https://www.gov.ie/pdf/?file=https://assets.gov.ie/268169/c042cc66-08de-4818-b27a-409ce8c527f8.pdf%22%20\\l%20%22page=null)

##  How much do I get?

The amount of money you get depends on the type of forest you plant.

The grant is split into 2 separate main payments.

You claim the first payment after you’ve planted the trees to cover this cost.
This payment is worth 75% of the overall grant.

You claim your second payment 4 years after planting after you have
successfully established your forest. This is 25% of the overall grant.

You also get yearly premiums. The value and number of premiums you get depends
on the type of forest you plant and if you are a farmer.

Forest Type  |  Grant rates (€ per hectare)  |  Annual premium payments (€ per hectare)  |  Number of premiums for farmers  |  Number of premiums for non-farmers   
---|---|---|---|---  
FT1 – Native forests  |  6,744  |  1,103  |  20  |  15   
FT2 – Forests for water  |  6,744  |  1,142  |  20  |  15

FT7 – Diverse broadleaf  |  4,314  |  973  |  20  |  15   
FT8 – Agroforestry  |  8,555  |  975  |  10  |  10   
FT9 – Seed orchards  |  10,000  |  1,142  |  20  |  15   
FT10 – Continuous cover forestry  |  5,421  |  912  |  20  |  15   
FT11 – Mixed high forests: diverse conifer, minimum 20% broadleaves  |  4,452  |  863  |  20  |  15   
FT12 – Mixed high forests with Sitka Spruce, minimum 20% broadleaves  |  3,858  |  746  |  20  |  15   
  
There may also be additional payments for certain types of forests. For
example, the ‘Forests on public lands' grant includes extra money to install
trails, seats and signs. You may also be able to get an additional allowance
for fencing.

##  How do I apply?

You need to hire a registered forester to submit your application for you.
Check  
Gov.ie for a [ list of registered foresters and forestry companies
](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/205869-list-of-registered-foresters/) .

There are a number of steps involved in getting started on the scheme.

**1\. Contact a farm advisor**

Contact your local Teagasc advisor or farm advisor to discuss the scheme with
them. They will tell you if your land is suitable for planting a forest and
how this scheme will impact any other farming payments you are getting.

**2\. Contact a registered forester** **and apply for an afforestation
licence**

Contact a registered forester to help with your application and the process.

Your registered forester can submit your afforestation licence application,
which you need for this scheme.

You should contact several forester companies to find one that works for you.

After you choose your registered forester, you should sign a contract with
them and hire a solicitor.

**3\. Plan your forest and submit your application for technical approval**

Your registered forester submits your application for technical approval for
the Afforestation Scheme with you.

You may need to submit an environmental report or an Appropriate Assessment
Pre-Screening Report with the application.

At this stage, you need to decide if you want the forester to manage planting,
establishing and maintaining your forest for the first 4 years, or if you
would prefer to do it yourself.

You may also need to get an ecologist to do an ecological assessment and
report.

**4\. Apply for financial support and begin planting**

After you get written technical approval with an afforestation licence your
registered forester can apply for financial approval.

After you get financial approval, you can begin planting.

**5\. Get paid the grant**

The grant is split into 2 payments. You get the first payment after you plant
your trees.

You get your second payment after 4 years, when you have successfully
established your forest.

You need to apply to the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine for
each payment. The amount you get paid depends on the tree species you use and
the soil types.

##  Additional reports and documents

###  Environmental reports and assessments

**Environmental process for areas of 50 hectares or more**

If your planned forest is on 50 hectares of land or more, you need to submit
an [ Environmental Impact Statement (EIS
](https://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2017/si/407/made/en/print#:~:text=%E2%80%9C%E2%80%98EIS%E2%80%99%20means%20%E2%80%9Ca%20report%20prepared%20by%20competent%20experts%2C%20submitted%20by%20the%20applicant%20that%20complies%20with%20the%20requirements%20of%20Article%205.1%20of%20the%20EIA%20Directive%20and%20is%20referred%20to%20in%20the%20EIA%20Directive%20as%20the%20environmental%20impact%20assessment%20report%3B%E2%80%9D%2C)
) with your application for technical approval for the Afforestation Scheme.

The EIS should outline any environmental impact that might be caused by your
proposed planting and the steps you plan to take to minimise these.

The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine will then do an [
Environmental Impact Assessment
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/environment/climate-
change/environmental-impact-assessment/#l1c975) as part of your application
process.

**Environmental process for areas of less than 50 hectares**

If your planned forest is less than 50 hectares, there is an environmental
impact assessment screening process at the pre-approval stage when you apply
for your afforestation licence.

This determines if your project may have a significant effect on the local
environment. This is done by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the
Marine.

If the Department decides that your planned planting area could have a large
environmental impact, you must submit an Environmental Impact Statement so the
Department to carry out an Environmental Impact Assessment.

###  Appropriate Assessment Pre-Screening Report

An Appropriate Assessment Pre-Screening Report lets you and your registered
forester know if your planned forest is going to impact a [ Special Protection
Area (SPA) ](https://www.npws.ie/protected-sites/sac) or a [ Special Area of
Conservation (SAC) ](https://www.npws.ie/protected-sites/sac) , which may
affect if your planned forest is approved.

If the report shows that your planned forest won’t have an impact on these
areas, you can submit this report as part of your application.

If it shows that the forest will have an impact on these areas, you can submit
a [ Natura Impact Statement (NIS) ](https://www.npws.ie/protected-
sites/guidance-appropriate-assessment-planning-authorities) along with your
application and your Appropriate Assessment Pre-Screening Report, outlining
how you plan to avoid causing a negative impact on the areas.

You can [ see the Appropriate Assessment Pre-Screening Report template (docx)
](https://assets.gov.ie/96702/7aa651c7-b409-42f7-a775-6c3345af46d0.docx) on
gov.ie.

##  Can I appeal a decision?

You or your registered forester can appeal decisions made by the Department
for Agriculture, Food and the Marine about:

  * Your application for an afforestation licence at pre-approval stage 
  * A grant 
  * A premium 
  * A penalty 

**Appealing a decision about an afforestation licence**

If your application for an afforestation licence is refused, you can appeal
the decision to the [ Forestry Appeals Committee (FAC)
](https://www.agriappeals.gov.ie/forestryappealscommittee/facnoticeofappealform/)
.

You must submit a [ Notice of Appeal form
](https://www.agriappeals.gov.ie/forestryappealscommittee/facnoticeofappealform/)
to the FAC by post, along with a fee of €200. This must be received by the FAC
within 14 days of getting the decision about your licence from the Department
of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.

**Appealing a decision about a grant, premium or penalty**

If you want to appeal a decision about a grant payment, premium payment or
penalty you must write to the Agriculture Appeals Office. You can [ read the
procedure for appealing these decisions ](http://www.agriappeals.gov.ie/) .

##  Consultations, submissions and observations on afforestation licence
applications

When the Department gets an application for the Afforestation Scheme, they
post a public notice on their website. This includes the:

  * Application contract number 
  * Location of the proposed forest 
  * Size of the proposed forest 

Applications that need an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) may also have
notices of the application, the EIS and any other major information submitted
to local or national newspapers.

You can view forestry licences and applications using the [ Forestry Licence
Viewer ](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/a91f7-forestry-licence-viewer/) .

###  Making submissions or observations on an afforestation application

Anyone can make a submission or observation on an afforestation application.
You must make a submission about the application within 30 days of the notice
being published on the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine’s
website.

If the Department receives a Natura Impact Statement (NIS) or if they complete
an Appropriate Assessment Report, there will be a second 30-day consultation
period.

The fee for making a submission is €20. This fee is non-refundable, regardless
of the final decision on the licence application.
