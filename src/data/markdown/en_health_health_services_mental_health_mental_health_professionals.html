##  Information

Mental health services use a multidisciplinary approach, which means that a
number of different types of healthcare professionals offer their skills in a
co-ordinated and complementary way. This page describes mental health
professionals and what they do.

Read more about [ mental health services ](/en/health/health-services/mental-
health/mental-health-services/) in Ireland on our website.

Access [ support from the HSE ](https://www2.hse.ie/mental-health/) for your
mental health.

##  Doctors

###  Family doctor (GP)

Your GP is often the first person you will seek help from. They will assess
the problem and may if necessary:

  * Provide medication and monitor your condition, or 
  * Refer you to a specialist, for example, psychiatrist, psychologist or counsellor 

###  Psychiatrist

A psychiatrist is a medical doctor that specialises in mental health.
Psychiatrists are responsible for the medical care of psychiatric patients and
can help you with your mental health using medication and counselling.

A psychiatrist usually works in a psychiatric hospital or unit or as part of a
community care team but can also be part of a private practice.

In most cases, your GP will refer you to a psychiatrist if they think it is
necessary or if you ask for a referral.

A psychiatrist will assess you to decide on the best treatment. This may
involve treatment with medication or referral to a member of the mental health
team. If a psychiatrist thinks it necessary, they may suggest that you be
admitted to hospital.

##  Psychologists

###  Psychologist

A psychologist is trained in the study of human behaviour and tries to explain
feelings, thoughts and behaviour.

Psychologists can assess and treat a wide range of psychological problems such
as anxiety and depression. They can also help you examine the effects your
illness is having on your life and ways you can cope with those effects. A
psychologist will try to bring you closer to understanding your illness.

Within mental health, the psychologist usually works as a clinical, community
or counselling psychologist. They do not prescribe medication unless they are
also medically qualified.

The psychologist works in different ways such as group work, telephone
consultations or one-to-one consultations.

###  Clinical psychologist

A clinical psychologist has a specialist qualification in mental health and
works as part of the mental health team in a unit or hospital and are involved
in assessment and counselling therapy.

A clinical psychologist may offer you family therapy, or a particular approach
may be used for specific problems. For example, if you have a phobia, [
cognitive-behavioural approach
](https://www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/4/mental-health-
services/dsc/communityservices/cbt.html) therapy may be used. Referral is
often through a GP or psychiatrist, but you may also self-refer.

###  Community psychologist

A community psychologist has a clinical qualification and works as part of a
community-based team with professionals such as social workers, speech
therapists and community welfare officers.

The community psychologist assesses and works with patients with a wide range
of problems, including children with behavioural, educational and other
difficulties.

###  Counselling psychologist

Counselling psychology, includes a broad range of methods that can help you
improve their well-being, alleviate distress and maladjustment, resolve
crises, and increase their ability to live more highly functioning lives.

Counselling psychologists work in many places such as, schools and colleges,
industrial workplaces and health services.

##  Therapists

###  Psychotherapist

Psychotherapy can be more in-depth than other forms of therapy. It suggests
that the less aware you are of your motives, feelings and actions, the more
they control you and the more you stay stuck in old patterns that may be
harmful to you.

A psychotherapist can help you examine your subconscious thoughts. By making
you aware of your unconscious motives, fears and feelings and dealing with
them in order to get relief from your symptoms. Psychotherapists usually
follow a long postgraduate training during which trainees must undergoing
therapy.

###  Behavioural therapist

Behavioural therapy is based on the idea you can change what people do by
teaching them to respond to things in a different way.

Behavioural therapy helps you control undesirable habits or irrational fears
(phobias) and can be used in treating behavioural conditions such as eating
disorders.

In many cases, behaviours can be learned or unlearned through basic
conditioning techniques including:

  * Aversive conditioning - unwanted habits are paired with unpleasant stimuli 
  * Systematic desensitisation - a stimulus that causes anxiety is paired with a pleasant one. 

Some behavioural therapists may also be psychiatrists, psychologists,
psychiatric nurses or social workers who have been trained to work in this
area. While this therapy is often used to treat behaviour disorders, it may
not be available in all regions.

###  Cognitive behavioural therapist

Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) aims to reduce mental health problems, and
behaviour by changing your behaviour and thinking patterns.

CBT professionals believe that changes in thinking can reduce distress and
bring about a change in symptoms and behaviour. This change can happen by

  * Practicing new behaviours, and 
  * Analysing thinking patterns. 

Cognitive behavioural therapists may not all be psychologists or
psychiatrists. You should check with your [ HSE Local Health Office
](https://www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/1/lho/) to see if the service is
available in your area.

###

##  Counsellor

There are different forms of counselling for a wide range of problems and many
counsellors specialise in areas such as [ addiction ](/en/health/health-
services/alcohol-and-drug-treatment-services/alcohol-addiction-services/) or [
bereavement ](/en/death/bereavement-counselling-and-support/) .

Counsellors do not judge you but attentively listen and respect you as the
client. Counselling aims to help you take control of your own life. You can
usually self-refer to counselling, although a GP, psychiatrist or trusted
friend may be able to recommend someone suitable.

Some counsellors are qualified psychologists, but many are not. Those who are
not may have a basic degree or training in other areas and/or relevant work
experience (for example, teaching or nursing) plus a counselling
qualification. These qualifications can vary from Master's degrees to short-
term courses.

It is important to make sure you are happy with the training and
qualifications of any counsellor that you choose. Counselling is often one
session per week and can continue for a specific number of sessions or last
longer, although this can vary.

###  Addiction counsellor

Addiction counsellors provide assessment, counselling, information and [
addiction treatment services
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/health/health-services/alcohol-and-
drug-treatment-services/alcohol-addiction-services/) for people suffering from
alcohol, drugs and gambling addictions.

Before getting counselling for addiction, you must go through a detoxification
programme, if necessary. You are then referred to the community-based
addiction treatment service.

Individual and group counselling is often used, focusing on the consequences
of your behaviour caused by the addiction. The main part of the treatment
examines the triggering factors that lead to the development of the addiction.

Target goals are set to try and establish new patterns of healthy behaviour.
An important part of the treatment is to involve a family member, who can help
you achieve these targets. Addiction counselling lasts for an average of 6 to
8 weeks and is followed by an after-care service.
