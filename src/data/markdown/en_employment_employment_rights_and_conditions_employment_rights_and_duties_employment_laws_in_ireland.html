##  Introduction

This page outlines some of the main pieces of employment legislation in
Ireland. You can find the full Acts and Statutory Instruments on [
irishstatutebook.ie ](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/) and [ oireachtas.ie
](https://www.oireachtas.ie/en/bills/) .

##  Information about your job

The [ Terms of Employment (Information) Acts 1994–2014
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1994/en/act/pub/0005/index.html) says
employers must give employees certain information about their employment, such
as a contract of employment, a job description, rate of pay and hours of work.

The [ General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) 2018 ](/en/government-in-
ireland/data-protection/overview-of-general-data-protection-regulation/) gives
you much more control over your personal data. It also sets out the
responsibilities of companies who control and process your data.

The [ Employment (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2018
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2018/act/38/enacted/en/html) bans zero-
hour contracts in most situations. It also provides for minimum payments and
banded hours. The Act states that employers must give employees information on
the core terms of employment within 5 days of starting work. The rules were
updated by the [ European Union (Transparent and Predictable Working
Conditions) Regulations 2022
](https://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2022/si/686/made/en/print) .

##  Young people at work

The [ Protection of Young Persons (Employment) Act 1996
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1996/en/act/pub/0016/index.html) regulates
the employment and working conditions of children and young people. You can
read more about [ the rights of young workers ](/en/employment/starting-work-
and-changing-job/young-people-at-work/rights-of-young-workers/) .

##  Terms and conditions of employment

The [ National Minimum Wage Act 2000
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2000/en/act/pub/0005/index.html) provides for
the [ national minimum wage ](/en/employment/employment-rights-and-
conditions/pay-and-employment/minimum-wage/) .

The [ Payment of Wages Act 1991
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1991/en/act/pub/0025/index.html) gives
employees the right to a pay slip showing their gross wages (total pay before
deductions) and details of any deductions. The [ Payment of Wages (Amendment)
(Tips and Gratuities) Act 2022
](https://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2022/act/23/enacted/en/html) sets out
rules about how employers share tips, gratuities and service charges amongst
employees. It makes it illegal to use tips or gratuities to make up basic
wages.

The [ Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Acts 1973–2005
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1973/en/act/pub/0004/index.html) set out the
amount of notice you are entitled to before the termination of employment.

The [ Industrial Relations (Amendment) Act 2015
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2015/act/27/enacted/en/html) provides a
framework for workers looking to improve their terms and conditions of
employment where collective bargaining is not recognised by their employer.
The Act also provides for [ Registered Employment Agreements (REAs) and
Sectoral Employment Orders (SEOs) ](/en/employment/employment-rights-and-
conditions/industrial-relations-and-trade-unions/employment-agreements-and-
orders/) .

##  Working hours, annual leave and holiday leave

The [ Organisation of Working Time Act 1997
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1997/en/act/pub/0020/index.html) covers a
number of employment conditions, including [ maximum working hours
](/en/employment/employment-rights-and-conditions/hours-of-work/working-
hours/) , night work, [ annual leave ](/en/employment/employment-rights-and-
conditions/leave-and-holidays/annual-leave/) and [ public holiday leave
](/en/employment/employment-rights-and-conditions/leave-and-holidays/public-
holidays/) .

The [ Organisation of Working Time (Records) (Prescribed Form and Exemptions)
Regulations 2001 ](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2001/en/si/0473.html)
require employers to keep records of:

  * The number of hours employees work on a daily and weekly basis 
  * The amount of leave granted to employees in each week as [ annual leave ](/en/employment/employment-rights-and-conditions/leave-and-holidays/annual-leave/) or as [ public holidays ](/en/employment/employment-rights-and-conditions/leave-and-holidays/public-holidays/)
  * Details of the payments in respect of this leave 
  * Employees’ starting and finishing times. 

##  Statutory leave

_Statutory leave_ is the minimum amount of paid leave from work that you are
legally entitled to. There are different types of statutory leave, including:

###  Maternity leave

The [ Maternity Protection (Amendment) Act 2004
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2004/en/act/pub/0028/index.html) provides for
paid time off work for [ ante-natal classes ](/en/birth-family-
relationships/before-your-baby-is-born/antenatal-classes/) , [ additional
maternity leave ](/en/employment/employment-rights-and-conditions/leave-and-
holidays/maternity-leave/) , and [ breastfeeding ](/en/birth-family-
relationships/after-your-baby-is-born/breastfeeding/) .

The [ Maternity Protection Act 1994
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1994/en/act/pub/0034/index.html) covers [
maternity leave ](/en/employment/employment-rights-and-conditions/leave-and-
holidays/maternity-leave/) , the right to return to work after maternity
leave, as well as health and safety during and immediately after pregnancy.

###  Paternity leave

The [ Paternity Leave and Benefit Act 2016
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2016/act/11/enacted/en/html) provides for
[ statutory paternity leave ](/en/employment/employment-rights-and-
conditions/leave-and-holidays/paternity-leave/) of 2 weeks. This must be taken
in the first 6 months following the birth or adoption of a child.

###  Adoptive leave

The [ Adoptive Leave Act 2005
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2005/en/act/pub/0025/index.html) amends the [
Adoptive Leave Act 1995
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1995/en/act/pub/0002/index.html) which
provides for [ adoptive leave ](/en/employment/employment-rights-and-
conditions/leave-and-holidays/adoptive-leave/) from employment and the right
to return to work following such leave.

The [ Family Leave and Miscellaneous Provisions Act 2021
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2021/act/4/enacted/en/print.html) allows
adoptive couples to choose who should take adoptive leave and benefit. The
parent who does not get adoptive leave is entitled to paternity leave.

###  Parental leave

The [ Parental Leave Acts 1998 -2019
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1998/act/30/enacted/en/html) provide for
a period of unpaid [ parental leave ](/en/employment/employment-rights-and-
conditions/leave-and-holidays/parental-leave/) for parents to care for their
children. The Acts also provide for a limited right to paid leave in
circumstances of serious family illness (known as ‘ [ force majeure
](/en/employment/employment-rights-and-conditions/leave-and-holidays/types-of-
leave-from-work/) ’).  
  
The [ Work Life Balance and Miscellaneous Provisions Act 2023
](https://www.gov.ie/en/press-release/feae1-new-workers-rights-including-
domestic-violence-leave-introduced-under-the-work-life-balance-bill-passed-by-
the-oireachtas/) , amends the Parental Leave Act. It provides for 5 days
unpaid leave for carers and parents to provide care or support for a [ serious
medical reason ](/en/employment/employment-rights-and-conditions/leave-and-
holidays/unpaid-leave-for-medical-care/) .

###  Parent’s leave

This provides for 9 weeks of leave for each parent of a child born or adopted
on or after 1 August 2024, a child who is under the age of 2 on 1 August 2024
or an adopted child who has been placed with the family less than 2 years on 1
August 2024.

It aims to let working parents spend more time with their baby or adopted
child during the first 2 years.

This was originally provided for by the [ Parent’s Leave and Benefit Act 2019
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2019/act/35/enacted/en/pdf) . It was
extended to 9 weeks in August 2024 by the [ Parent’s Leave and Benefit Act
2019 (Extension of Periods of Leave) Order 2024.
](https://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2024/si/300/made/en/print)

###  Carer’s leave

The [ Carer's Leave Act 2001
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2001/en/act/pub/0019/index.html) gives
employees the right to take temporary unpaid [ carer's leave
](/en/employment/employment-rights-and-conditions/leave-and-holidays/carers-
leave/) to care for someone who needs full-time care and attention.

###  Sick leave

The [ Sick Leave Act 2022
](https://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2022/act/24/enacted/en/html) commenced
on 1 January 2023. Employees have a legal right to paid sick leave for up to 5
days per year in 2024 (increased from 3 days in 2023). The rate of payment for
statutory sick leave is 70% of normal wages, up to a maximum of €110 per day.

**Domestic violence leave:**

The [ Work Life Balance and Miscellaneous Provisions Act 2023
](https://www.gov.ie/en/press-release/feae1-new-workers-rights-including-
domestic-violence-leave-introduced-under-the-work-life-balance-bill-passed-by-
the-oireachtas/) provides for [ 5 days’ paid domestic violence leave
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/employment/employment-rights-and-
conditions/leave-and-holidays/domestic-violence-leave/) for employees who need
to take time off work if they are experiencing domestic violence and abuse.
There is no minimum service required to qualify. The leave can be taken if the
employee is directly experiencing domestic violence and abuse, or if they are
supporting a ‘relevant person’.

##  Safety at work

[ Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005 (as amended)
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2005/en/act/pub/0010/index.html) replaced the
provisions of the Safety, Health and Welfare Act 1989. It consolidates and
updates the existing [ health and safety ](/en/employment/employment-rights-
and-conditions/health-and-safety/health-safety-work/) law. Changes include the
provision for higher fines for breaches of safety legislation.

##  Equality in the workplace

The [ Employment Equality Acts 1998–2015
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1998/en/act/pub/0021/index.html) ban
discrimination in a range of areas, including gender, civil status, family
status, age, race, religion, disability, sexual orientation and membership of
the Traveller community. The Acts also place an obligation on employers to
prevent [ harassment in the workplace ](/en/employment/equality-in-
work/harassment-at-work/) .

The [ Equality (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2015
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2015/en/act/pub/0043/index.html) makes
significant amendments to the Employment Equality Act 1998 in the areas of:

  * [ Retirement ](/en/employment/retirement/older-people-and-working/retirement-age/) and age discrimination 
  * Discrimination by religious, medical and educational institutions on religious grounds 
  * Indirect discrimination 

##  Part-time, fixed-term, agency, and self-employed workers

###  Part-time employees

The [ Protection of Employees (Part-Time Work) Act 2001
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2001/en/act/pub/0045/index.html) prevents
discrimination against [ part-time workers
](../../types_of_employment/part_time_workers.en.html) . It aims to improve
the quality of part-time work, to facilitate the development of part-time work
on a voluntary basis and to contribute to the flexible organisation of working
time that takes account of the needs of employers and workers. It guarantees
that part-time workers are not treated less favourably than full-time workers.

###  Fixed term employees

The [ Protection of Employees (Fixed Term Work) Act 2003
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2003/en/act/pub/0029/index.html) protects [
fixed-term employees ](/en/employment/types-of-employment/types-of-
employment#lceb2f) by ensuring they cannot be treated less favourably than
comparable permanent workers, and that employers cannot continually renew [
fixed term contracts ](/en/employment/employment-rights-and-
conditions/contracts-of-employment/rights-of-fixed-term-workers/) . Under the
Act, employees can only work on one or more fixed term contracts for a
continuous period of 4 years. After this, the employee is considered to have a
contract of indefinite duration (e.g. a permanent contract).

###  Agency workers

The [ Protection of Employment (Temporary Agency Work) Act 2012
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2012/en/act/pub/0013/index.html) provides
that all temporary [ agency workers ](/en/employment/types-of-
employment/agency-workers/) must be treated equally (as if they had been
directly recruited by the hirer) in respect of the duration of working time,
rest periods, night work, annual leave, public holidays and pay.

###  Self-employment

The [ Code of Practice for Determining Employment or Self-employment Status of
Individuals 2021(pdf)
](https://www.gov.ie/pdf/?file=https://assets.gov.ie/34185/fcfac49276914907b939f64fad110ae8.pdf#page=null)
provides criteria which can be used to clarify whether a person is employed or
self-employed.

Revenue uses these [ guidelines (pdf)

for taxation purposes.

##  Whistleblowing

The [ Protected Disclosures Act 2014
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2014/en/act/pub/0014/index.html) protects
employees from penalisation if they make a disclosure about wrongdoing in the
workplace. The [ Protected Disclosures (Amendment) Act 2022
](https://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2022/act/27/enacted/en/html) commences
on 1 January 2023. It requires organisations with more than 50 employees to
have policies and processes for protected disclosures.

##  Business take-overs

The [ European Communities (Protection of Employees on Transfer of
Undertakings) Regulations 2003
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2003/en/si/0131.html) apply to any [ transfer
of an undertaking, business or part of a business ](/en/employment/employment-
rights-and-conditions/contracts-of-employment/transfer-of-business/) from one
employer to another employer, as a result of a legal transfer (including the
assignment or forfeiture of a lease) or merger. Employees’ rights and
entitlements are protected during this transfer.

The [ Employees (Provision of Information and Consultation) Act 2006
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2006/en/act/pub/0009/index.html) established
minimum requirements for employees' right to information and consultation
about the development of their employment's structure and activities during a
transfer of undertakings. It applies to employers with at least 50 employees.

##  Redundancy and dismissals

The [ Redundancy Payments Acts 1967–2014
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1967/act/21/enacted/en/html) gives a
minimum entitlement to a redundancy payment for employees who have a set
period of service. Not all employees are entitled to the statutory redundancy
payment, even where there is a redundancy situation.

The [ Protection of Employment (Exceptional Collective Redundancies and
Related Matters) Act 2007
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2007/en/act/pub/0027/index.html) set up a
redundancy panel to consider certain proposed collective redundancies. The Act
also removed the upper age limit for entitlement to redundancy payments.

###  Dismissal

Under the [ Unfair Dismissals Acts 1977–2015
](http://www.lawreform.ie/_fileupload/RevisedActs/WithAnnotations/HTML/EN_ACT_1977_0010.htm)
, unfair dismissal can occur where either:

  * Your employer terminates your contract of employment, with or without notice 
  * You terminate your contract of employment, with or without notice, due to the conduct of your employer. This is known as [ constructive dismissal. ](/en/employment/unemployment-and-redundancy/dismissal/constructive-dismissal/)

You can get further information on the Employment Equality Acts 1998–2015 and
the Equal Status Acts 2000–2015 from the [ Irish Human Rights and Equality
Commission ](/en/justice/law-and-rights/irish-human-rights-and-equality-
commission/) .

##  Work permits

The [ Employment Permits Acts 2003–2014
](https://revisedacts.lawreform.ie/eli/2003/act/7/front/revised/en/html)
provide for 8 different types of [ employment permits
](../../migrant_workers/employment_permits/overview_employment_permits.en.html)
.

You can read about recent regulations on employment permits on the [
Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment website.
](https://dbei.gov.ie/en/Legislation/?t=Employment+Permits)

##  Complaints about a breach of employment rights

The [ Workplace Relations Act 2015
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2015/act/16/enacted/en/html) established
the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC), which replaced the Labour Relations
Commission, Rights Commissioner Service, Equality Tribunal, and National
Employment Rights Authority.

You can refer complaints, disputes or grievances regarding breaches of
employment rights under certain legislation to the Workplace Relations
Commission using their [ online complaint form
](https://www.workplacerelations.ie/en/complaints_disputes/making_a_complaint/)
. Before you apply to the WRC, you must tell your employer of your intention
to contact the Workplace Relations Commission. You should try to resolve the
matter with your employer directly before referring a complaint to the WRC.

A [ Workplace Relations Commission adjudicator ](/en/employment/enforcement-
and-redress/adjudication-employment-rights-disputes-and-complaints/) will
listen to both sides before completing an investigation of the complaint and
issuing a decision.

Read more on our page about [ making a complaint to the WRC
](/en/employment/enforcement-and-redress/adjudication-employment-rights-
disputes-and-complaints/) , including what to expect at the hearing.

###  Mediation

Often, disputes between employers and employees can be resolved using [
workplace mediation ](/en/employment/enforcement-and-redress/workplace-
mediation/) .

Mediation is a confidential process, which aims to resolve workplace disputes
and disagreements, particularly between individuals or small groups. A
mediator will work with employees and employers to find a mutually agreed
solution to the problem.

The [ Mediation Act 2017
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2017/act/27/enacted/en/print.html) allows
employees to use mediation for certain civil claims, for example, personal
injuries actions. This legislation does not apply to employment disputes
brought to the WRC, including disputes being dealt with by mediation officers
of the WRC.
