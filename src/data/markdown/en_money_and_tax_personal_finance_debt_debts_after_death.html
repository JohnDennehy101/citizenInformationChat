#  What happens to debts after death?

  * Debts after death 
  * Family or shared home 
  * Insurance policies 
  * Savings and loans 
  * Other unsecured debts 
  * Duty of personal representative 

##  Debts after death

Your _estate_ is all the property, goods and money that you own that are
available to be shared out after your death.

When you die, any debts you have must be [ repaid from your estate
](/en/death/the-deceaseds-estate/dealing-with-the-deceaseds-estate/) before
other entitlements are shared out. This is the case whether or not you have
made a will. Your creditors can sue your estate for the payment of outstanding
debts.

In some situations, property or money can be shared out without becoming part
of the estate and so is not available to pay debts. For example, some money in
credit unions or joint bank accounts and some insurance policies.

If you die and have no estate, then your debts die with you as they cannot be
repaid. Your relatives do not have to pay off your debts unless they have
provided personal guarantees for those debts or they are named on the credit
agreement

If someone close to you has died, you may need advice on [ dealing with money
matters after a death ](/en/death/financial-concerns-following-a-death/money-
matters-after-a-death/) . If you are having financial difficulties, MABS can
offer support on [ how to manage bills, debts and loans
](https://mabs.ie/managing-money/unexpected-life-events/bereavement-and-debt/)
.

##  Family or shared home

If you and your spouse or partner are co-owners under [ joint tenancy
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/birth-family-relationships/cohabiting-
couples/property-rights-cohabiting-couples/#c83884) of the [ family or shared
home ](/en/birth-family-relationships/separation-and-divorce/family-and-
shared-home/) , your spouse or partner becomes the sole owner on your death.
In other words, your home does not form part of your estate.

If you are co-owners but you each own a defined share of the property, this is
called _tenancy in common_ . In those circumstances, your share in the
property will form part of your estate following your death.

If you are the sole owner, your property will form part of your estate.
However, your spouse, partner or cohabitant may be able to claim a share to
the property.

If there is a mortgage on the home, mortgage protection insurance may cover
the remaining amounts of the mortgage.

##  Insurance policies

Some insurance policies have a nominated beneficiary. In this case, the
proceeds of the policy go directly to that beneficiary and do not form part of
your estate.

In other cases, the proceeds of the insurance policy do form part of your
estate and are available for the payment of your debts. What happens in any
particular case depends on the terms of the policy.

##  Savings and loans

###  Credit union deposits

If you are a member of a credit union, you can nominate someone to get your
savings if you die. Up to €27,000 can pass to the nominated person without
going through the usual process for administration of your estate. Amounts
over €27,000 must be administered by your [ personal representative
](/en/death/the-deceaseds-estate/what-happens-the-deceaseds-estate/) .

###  Joint bank accounts

If you open a joint bank account with someone else, you can specify what you
intend to happen if you die. If you intend the other account holder to inherit
your share, then it does not become part of your estate. Otherwise, your share
does become part of your estate.

###  Credit card debt, bank overdrafts, personal loans

If you have a credit card, bank overdraft or personal loan these are known as
_unsecured debts_ . They are not attached to any asset so the creditor does
not have the right to take a particular item of property if the debt is not
paid.

Lenders are entitled to pursue your estate for these unpaid debts on your
death. Repayment of unsecured debts must wait until other priority debts are
paid.

Your family does not have to cover your debts unless they have provided
personal guarantees. If the loan is in joint names the joint holder will be
responsible for any debts.

If your loan is with a credit union it will usually be cleared upon your death
through the credit union’s own insurance scheme.

##  Other unsecured debts

Other unsecured debts could include utility bill arrears, nursing home debt or
medical bills.

Debts owed are the responsibility of the estate and creditors will usually
wait until the estate is settled before they look for payment.

##  Duty of personal representative

When you die, all your assets are gathered together by your [ personal
representative ](/en/death/the-deceaseds-estate/what-happens-the-deceaseds-
estate/) , that is your executor (if you had a will) or administrator (if you
die without having made a will). The first duty of the personal representative
is to pay your funeral and other expenses and then your debts.

###  Insolvent estate

Your estate is insolvent if your assets do not cover your:

  * Funeral 
  * Testamentary and administration expenses (the expenses of dealing with your estate) 
  * Debts and liabilities 

This is the case whether you had a will or died intestate (without a will).

If you have no assets then payment of debts does not arise.

Whatever assets you do have will be used to pay off your debts in the
following order of priority:

  1. Funeral, testamentary and administration expenses 
  2. Creditors who have security, for example, mortgage providers 
  3. Preferential debts - these are mainly taxes and social insurance contributions 
  4. Ordinary debts, for example personal loans or credit cards 

###  Solvent estate

A solvent estate is one where there are enough assets to pay the debts and the
funeral and testamentary expenses.

Where there are more assets than liabilities, your estate is solvent. However,
if your assets are not sufficient to fulfil all of the wishes in your will,
after paying the debts and expenses, your estate is solvent but not
sufficient.

If your estate is solvent, your funeral and other expenses and your debts must
be paid first. If you die [ intestate ](/en/death/before-a-death/making-a-
will/) (without making a will), the rest of your estate is then divided
according to the rules on intestacy.

If you have made a will but there will not be enough left after paying all of
the debts and expenses to give the full gift to everyone, then there is a set
order to which parts of the estate debts are paid from first:

  1. Property which you did not deal with in the will (that is, property which would be distributed in accordance with the rules on intestacy) 
  2. The residue - this is the amount left over when specific gifts are dealt with 
  3. Property specifically devoted for the payment of debts 
  4. Property charged with the payment of debts 
  5. Pecuniary legacies - these are gifts of money as distinct from property or goods 
  6. Other gifts 

When making your will, you can specify a different order for the payment of
your debts.

terms ](/en/money-and-tax/personal-finance/debt/glossary-of-debt-terms/) .
