#  Pre-nuptial agreements

  * Introduction 
  * Legal status of pre-nuptial agreements 
  * Drafting a pre-nuptial agreement 
  * The future of pre-nuptial agreements 
  * Cohabitation agreements 

##  Introduction

A pre-nuptial agreement (also called an ante-nuptial agreement) is an
agreement between two people who plan to marry each other in relation to
property, maintenance and custody arrangements if their marriage should break
down.

##  Legal status of pre-nuptial agreements

Pre-nuptial agreements have no basis in law in Ireland. As a result, they are
not strictly binding. This means that if you have a pre-nuptial agreement in
place and you end up in court following the breakdown of your marriage, the
judge is not bound by the terms of the pre-nuptial agreement.

The only provision in Irish law is under sections 113 and 113A of the [
Succession Act 1965
](http://revisedacts.lawreform.ie/eli/1965/act/27/revised/en/pdf?annotations=true)
(as amended) where a spouse or a civil partner can renounce his/her legal
right share in a pre-nuptial agreement.

Although they are not legally binding, there is nothing in Irish law which
stops a couple planning to marry from having and signing a pre-nuptial
agreement. Importantly, such agreements can serve as guides for the courts in
[ judicial separation ](/en/birth-family-relationships/separation-and-
divorce/judicial-separation/) and [ divorce ](/en/birth-family-
relationships/separation-and-divorce/divorce-decrees/) cases. If a pre-nuptial
agreement makes ‘proper provision’ for each person it is more likely to be
persuasive on the judge. Therefore, in situations where one party is likely to
inherit a significant family farm or business, it will guide the judge in the
divorce or judicial separation on what the parties’ intentions were at the
outset.

##  Drafting a pre-nuptial agreement

Only pre-nuptial agreements entered into following independent legal advice
for both parties are likely to be taken into account. The court would have to
be satisfied that there had been a complete disclosure of assets before the
agreement was signed. It is also advisable for the agreement to provide for
reviews:

  * Periodically (for example, every five years) 
  * If children are born 
  * If there is a major change in circumstances (for example, assets are purchased or sold) 

The agreement should be in writing, be signed by each party and comply with
the rules of contract law.

##  The future of pre-nuptial agreements

In April 2007, the Government published the [ Report of the Study Group on
Pre-nuptial Agreements (pdf)
](http://www.justice.ie/en/JELR/PrenupRpt.pdf/Files/PrenupRpt.pdf) . The
report recommended that pre-nuptial agreements be legislated for by way of
introducing a new Section 16(2)A of the [ Family Law Act 1995
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1995/en/act/pub/0026/index.html) and new
Section 20(3)A of the [ Family Law (Divorce) Act 1996
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1996/en/act/pub/0033/index.html) so that the
courts would be required to have regard to existing pre-nuptial agreements
when making ancillary relief orders in judicial separation and divorce
proceedings.

The report also recommended that the legislation should contain procedural
guidelines, that is, how a pre-nuptial agreement is drawn up, what is required
for it to be enforceable. It is recommended that it must be:

  * In writing, signed and witnessed 
  * Made after each party has received separate legal advice 
  * Made with full disclosure of financial information 
  * Made not less than 28 days before the marriage 

The report also recommended that pre-nuptial agreements be reviewable on
death. This is so that a court may make financial provision for a surviving
spouse who may be unfairly affected by the provisions of a pre-nuptial
agreement on the death of the other spouse in certain circumstances.

The report’s recommendations have not yet been implemented.

##  Cohabitation agreements

The [ Civil Partnership and Certain Rights and Obligations of Cohabitants Act
2010 ](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2010/act/24/enacted/en/print) allows
cohabitants to enter into a cohabitants’ agreement to provide for financial
matters during the relationship or when the relationship ends, whether through
death or otherwise. However, the Act sets out that the agreement will only be
valid if each person has had independent legal advice or the couple obtained
legal advice together and have waived (in writing) the right to independent
legal advice. The agreement must be in writing, signed by both parties and
must comply with the general law of contract.

The Court can change or ignore such an agreement if its enforceability would
cause serious injustice.

For further information on cohabitation, see ‘ [ Rights of cohabiting couples
(couples living together) ](/en/birth-family-relationships/cohabiting-
couples/rights-of-cohabiting-couples/) ’.
