##  What is the Dependent Relative Tax Credit?

If you pay income tax, [ a tax credit reduces your tax by the amount of the
credit
](../income_tax_credits_and_reliefs/introduction_to_income_tax_credits_and_reliefs.en.html#lb4129)
.

If you maintain a dependent relative, you may qualify for the Dependent
Relative Tax Credit. Maintaining a relative means meeting the costs of
everyday living.

To qualify for the tax credit, the income of your relative must be below a
limit.

##  Who is a dependent relative?

The relative you claim for can be related to you or to your spouse or civil
partner if they are:

  * A parent who is widowed or is a surviving civil partner 
  * A son or daughter who lives with you and who you depend on because of your ill health or old age 
  * A relative who cannot maintain themselves due to age or illness 

Your dependant relative does not have to live in Ireland.

A child under the age of 18 will not qualify as a dependent relative unless
they live with and care for you. A child under 18 may qualify for the [
Incapacitated Child Tax Credit ](/en/money-and-tax/tax/tax-credits-and-
reliefs-for-people-with-disabilities/incapacitated-child-tax-credit/) .

###  Income limit for a dependent relative

If your dependent relative’s income is more than €17,404 in 2024, you will not
get the tax credit for that year. In previous years, the income limit was
€16,780 in 2023, €16,156 in 2022, €15,740 in 2021 and €15,060 in 2020.

All of your dependent relative's income is included for the income limit. This
includes social welfare payments, pensions, and deposit interest.

##  How much is the Dependent Relative Tax Credit?

The Dependent Relative Tax Credit is €245 (since 2021).
