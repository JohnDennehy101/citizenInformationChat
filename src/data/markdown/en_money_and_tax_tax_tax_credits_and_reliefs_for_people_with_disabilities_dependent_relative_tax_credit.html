  * Who is a dependent relative?

  * How to apply 
  * Where to apply 
  * Health expenses and your dependent relative 

##  What is the Dependent Relative Tax Credit?

If you pay income tax, [ a tax credit reduces your tax by the amount of the
credit
](../income_tax_credits_and_reliefs/introduction_to_income_tax_credits_and_reliefs.en.html#lb4129)
.

If you maintain a dependent relative, you may qualify for the Dependent
Relative Tax Credit. Maintaining a relative means meeting the costs of
everyday living.

To qualify for the tax credit, the income of your relative must be below a
limit.

##  Who is a dependent relative?

The relative you claim for can be related to you or to your spouse or civil
partner if they are:

  * A parent who is widowed or is a surviving civil partner 
  * A son or daughter who lives with you and who you depend on because of your ill health or old age 
  * A relative who cannot maintain themselves due to age or illness 

Your dependant relative does not have to live in Ireland.

A child under the age of 18 will not qualify as a dependent relative unless
they live with and care for you. A child under 18 may qualify for the [
Incapacitated Child Tax Credit ](/en/money-and-tax/tax/tax-credits-and-
reliefs-for-people-with-disabilities/incapacitated-child-tax-credit/) .

###  Income limit for a dependent relative

If your dependent relative’s income is more than €17,404 in 2024, you will not
get the tax credit for that year. In previous years, the income limit was
€16,780 in 2023, €16,156 in 2022, €15,740 in 2021 and €15,060 in 2020.

All of your dependent relative's income is included for the income limit. This
includes social welfare payments, pensions, and deposit interest.

##  How much is the Dependent Relative Tax Credit?

The Dependent Relative Tax Credit is €245 (since 2021).

##  How to apply

###  Apply online

If you are a **PAYE taxpayer** , you can claim the Dependent Relative Tax
Credit online by signing into [ Revenue's myAccount service
](https://www.ros.ie/myaccount-web/home.html) and using PAYE Services.

To claim for the current year:

  * Click ‘Manage your tax’ 
  * Select ‘Claim tax credits’ 
  * Select ‘Dependent Relative Tax Credit’ under the category ‘You and your family’ 

To claim for a previous year:

  * Click ‘Review your tax’ 
  * Click ‘Request’ under the ‘Statement of Liability’ section 
  * Click on ‘Complete Income Tax Return’ 
  * In the ‘Tax Credits & Reliefs’ page select ‘You and your family’ and click on ‘Dependent relative tax credit’ 
  * Enter the information requested 

If you pay tax under the **self-assessment** system, you can claim the credit
when you [ file your income tax return and make a self-assessment
](https://www.revenue.ie/en/self-assessment-and-self-employment/filing-your-
tax-return/index.aspx) .

###  Apply by post

Alternatively, you can claim the credit by completing the relevant form:

  * [ Form DR1 Claim for Dependent Relative Tax Credit (pdf) ](http://www.revenue.ie/en/personal-tax-credits-reliefs-and-exemptions/documents/formdr1.pdf) or 
  * [ Form DR2 Claim for a son or daughter or a child of your civil partner on whose services you depend (pdf) ](http://www.revenue.ie/en/personal-tax-credits-reliefs-and-exemptions/documents/formdr2.pdf)

The completed form should be sent to your Revenue office. It may take longer
to update your tax credits and issue a Tax Credit Certificate if you submit a
paper claim.

##  Where to apply

[ Lo-call telephone numbers and contact details for Revenue regional offices
are available on the Revenue website. ](http://www.revenue.ie/en/contact/lo-
call.html)

##  Health expenses and your dependent relative

You do not have to be getting a Dependent Relative Tax Credit to [ claim tax
back on medical expenses ](/en/money-and-tax/tax/income-tax-credits-and-
reliefs/taxation-and-medical-expenses/) you pay for a relative.

If you pay qualifying health expenses on behalf of another person (whether
they are dependent on you or not) you may be entitled to claim tax relief on
the amount paid. You can claim relief on expenses like:

  * Doctors' bills 
  * Maintenance or treatment in hospital 
  * Prescribed drugs and medicines. 

[ If you pay fees for a nursing home
](../income_tax_credits_and_reliefs/taxation_and_medical_expenses.en.html#l29c26)
that provides 24-hour on-site nursing care, you can claim income tax relief at
your highest rate of tax.
