##  Introduction

Many people are reported missing each year in Ireland. In most cases, going
missing does not involve a crime.

An adult may choose to leave home without telling anyone for a number of
reasons:

  * To escape domestic violence 
  * To take some time out because they are struggling to cope 
  * Because they are angry or upset 
  * Because they feel they have nowhere to turn 

You can report a person missing if you cannot contact them and you are
concerned about their safety or wellbeing. You do not have to wait 24 hours
before making a report.

##  How to report a missing person

You report a person missing by contacting the Gardaí. They will ask you for
information about the missing person, including:

  * Their full name 
  * Their place and date of birth 
  * A description of them 
  * Details of where and when they were last seen 
  * A list of their friends, relatives and colleagues 
  * A list of places where they often go 
  * Their bank and credit card details 
  * Details of medications they use 
  * Details of social media accounts they use 
  * Their mobile phone number 

You should also give the Gardaí a recent photograph of the missing person – in
electronic format if possible.

The National Missing Person Helpline has information about [ practical things
you can do to look for a missing person
](https://www.missingpersons.ie/search-options) .

##  What to expect from An Garda Síochána

The Gardaí will assess the level of risk and determine the best course of
action. There are different types of missing person cases and the Gardaí may
involve other agencies, such as the HSE, Mountain Rescue teams or Civil
Defence where necessary,

You should expect your report to be fully investigated. The investigation
starts when you first make your missing person report.

The Gardaí may issue a press release with details of the missing person if
they believe this will assist in their enquiries. Where a child is missing and
abduction is suspected, the Gardaí may issue a Child Rescue Alert.

##  Child Rescue Ireland Alert (CRI Alert)

A [ Child Rescue Alert (pdf) ](https://www.garda.ie/en/about-
us/publications/policy-documents/child-rescue-ireland-cri-alert-policy-
document.pdf) is used to alert the public to a child abduction and to appeal
for help. It is based on an agreement between the Gardaí, the media (including
some social media networks) and broadcasters and is designed to get
information about a missing child out to the public as soon as possible. The
Gardaí may issue a CRI Alert where:

  * The child is under 18 
  * There is a reasonable belief that the child was abducted 
  * There is a reasonable belief that there is an immediate and serious risk to the health and wellbeing of the child 
  * There is enough information for the public to be able to help the Gardaí in finding the child 

The Garda Press Office issues frequent updates on a CRI alert until the Alert
is cancelled.

##  Missing persons abroad

If a friend or relative has gone missing in another country, you should still
report it to the Gardaí. The Gardaí can report the case to Interpol who can
coordinate searches for missing persons internationally.

The [ Irish embassy or consulate ](https://www.ireland.ie/en/dfa/embassies/)
in the country where the person was last seen can put you in touch with
authorities and organisations that can help with a search. It cannot
investigate or carry out searches. This is the responsibility of the local
police forces.

EU and international agreements are in place to coordinate policing [ when a
child is abducted and taken abroad ](/en/birth-family-relationships/services-
and-supports-for-children/international-child-abduction/) .

##  Further information and contacts
