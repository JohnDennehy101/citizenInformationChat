##  What is the Back to Education Allowance?

You can take part in a Further Education or Higher Education course and get a
Back to Education Allowance (BTEA) if you:

  * Are unemployed 
  * Are parenting alone, or 
  * Have a disability and are getting certain payments from the Department of Social Protection (DSP) 

If you want to do other courses not covered under the BTEA (such as a personal
development or training course), you may return to education under the:

  * [ Part-Time Education option ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/back-to-education/part-time-education-option/)
  * [ Vocational Training Opportunities Scheme (VTOS) ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/education/further-education-and-training/vocational-training-opportunities-scheme/)
  * [ Education, Training and Development option ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/back-to-education/education-training-and-development-option/)

###  **What if my course is overseas?**

In general, you can only get BTEA for approved courses that start in Ireland
or in Northern Ireland. However, you can get BTEA for a year abroad (for
example, under the [ Erasmus+ programme
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/education/european-education-
programmes/eramus-plus/) ) if the year is an integral or mandatory part of
your course. This must be verified by the registrar or admissions office of
your college.

Read detailed information about the [ Back to Education Allowance on Gov.ie.
](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/5afe0f-operational-guidelines-back-to-
education-allowance/)

##  Study options for BTEA

There are 2 study options available under the BTEA scheme:

  * Further Level Education option 
  * Higher Level Education option 

Your course must lead to a [ Quality and Qualifications Ireland (QQI)
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/education/third-level-
education/colleges-and-qualifications/fet-qualifications/) accreditation
(including FETAC or HETAC awards), or equivalent. You must also progress in
educational qualifications.

For example, if you already have a Level 6 qualification on the National
Framework of Qualifications, the course you attend must be for at least a
Level 7 qualification. This progression rule has been relaxed for people
applying for Further Education Level courses at Levels 5 and 6 in limited
circumstances.

For example, if you already hold a Level 5 or 6 qualification, your Employment
Personal Advisor or Job Coach may recommend a course at the same or lesser
level if:

  * You have worked for at least 3 years and paid PRSI contributions 
  * You got your previous qualification 3 or more years ago and it is no longer relevant in the current job market 
  * The proposed course will let you progress your career, and it meets future skills needs or local demand 
  * The proposed course lasts no more than 24 months 

###  **Further Level Education option**

You can attend a Further Level Education course of education at any:

  * Secondary school 
  * Community school or college 
  * Comprehensive school 
  * Vocational school 
  * Education Training Board (ETB) 
  * College of Further Education 
  * Institute of Technology or Technological University 

The course must be full-time and lead to a certificate up to Level 6, as
recognised by the Department of Education or approved by Quality and
Qualifications Ireland (QQI).

For example:

  * [ Junior Certificate ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/education/state-examinations/junior-cycle-exam-and-results/)
  * [ Leaving Certificate ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/education/state-examinations/leaving-certificate/)
  * [ Post Leaving Certificate ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/education/further-education-and-training/post-leaving-certificate-courses/) (PLC) 
  * Foundation or Access courses provided by Universities and Institutes of Technology 

A Foundation or Access course is considered to be a Further Level Education
course for BTEA purposes.

###  **Higher Level Education option**

You can attend any Higher Level Education course in an approved third-level
institution (university, institute of education, or third-level college).

The course must be a full-time day course and be approved for the Student
Grant Scheme, or be approved by Quality and Qualifications Ireland (QQI). Not
all QQI courses are approved for BTEA.

####  **Undergraduate courses**

In general, you must be starting your Higher Level Education course at year
one. However, you may be eligible for BTEA if you:

  * Are exempt from part of your course because of a qualification you received in a previous course (for example, you have a higher certificate in a course that you now wish to take to degree level) 
  * Completed a year (or years) of your course as a part-time student 
  * Completed earlier years before becoming unemployed or receiving statutory redundancy 
  * Are permitted by your school or college to proceed to the next year of a course having dropped out or deferred a year (due to [ mitigating circumstances ](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/5afe0f-operational-guidelines-back-to-education-allowance/#study-options:~:text=the%20summer%20period.-,Definition%20of%20Mitigating%20Circumstances,-Mitigating%20circumstances%20can) ) 
  * Were getting a [ One-Parent Family Payment (OFP) ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/families-and-children/one-parent-family-payment/) while in full-time education and were affected by age-related changes to OFP (you may get BTEA in the middle of your course if you are affected by this) 

If you defer a year of study, you are treated as a new entrant when you return
to your course.

####  **Postgraduate courses**

If you hold a Level 7 ordinary degree, you can apply for a one year add-on
honours degree, which may be in a different discipline. You cannot get BTEA
for a new Level 8 degree course.

In limited circumstances, you may get BTEA for a postgraduate course. You may
get BTEA for:

  * A Level 8 Higher Diploma (H. Dip.) in any discipline 
  * A Level 9 Professional Masters in Education (PME) for post-primary teaching 
  * A Level 9 Masters degree where you don’t have a third level qualification and the college has admitted you based on relevant life experience 

You cannot get BTEA if you already have a postgraduate qualification, unless
it is a [ Springboard+ course
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/education/third-level-
education/applying-to-college/springboard/) .

##  Can I get the BTEA and the Student Grant Scheme?

The [ Student Grant Scheme
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/education/third-level-education/fees-
and-supports-for-third-level-education/student-grant-scheme/) is divided into
2 parts: maintenance grants and fee grants.

You cannot get the Back to Education Allowance (BTEA) and the maintenance part
of a student grant together.

While you can’t get the maintenance part of the student grant, you must still
submit a student grant application form to be assessed for a fee grant. The
fee grant can be used to pay your Student Contribution, field trip costs and
tuition fees (if payable).

###  **Other social welfare payments**

If you are getting one of the following payments, you can choose to either
transfer from your current social welfare payment to BTEA, or stay on your
current social welfare payment and apply for a student grant:

  * [ One-Parent Family Payment ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/families-and-children/one-parent-family-payment/)
  * [ Jobseeker’s Transitional Payment ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/unemployed-people/jobseekers-transitional-payment/)
  * [ Disability Allowance ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/disability-and-illness/disability-allowance/)
  * [ Invalidity Pension ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/disability-and-illness/invalidity-pension/) , or 
  * [ Illness Benefit ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/disability-and-illness/illness-benefit/)

You can choose whichever option benefits you most.

In general, people who are studying full-time cannot get Rent Supplement
unless they are getting BTEA.

education/social-welfare-payments-and-the-student-grant/#bfa7cb) .

##  How to qualify for BTEA

To qualify for Back to Education Allowance (BTEA), you must:

  * Be over 21, or over 24 for postgraduate courses (there are some exceptions to this – see ‘BTEA age limits’ below)

  * Have been getting a qualifying social welfare payment for a certain period of time (see ‘Qualifying period for BTEA’ below)

  * [ Illness Benefit ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/disability-and-illness/illness-benefit/) for **2 years or more** (however, periods spent on Illness Benefit can count towards the qualifying period if you qualify from another payment – half of the qualifying period must relate to the qualifying payment) 

You must re-establish your entitlement to a qualifying payment at the
beginning of each academic year so that you can continue getting BTEA during
the year. If you are no longer entitled to a qualifying payment, your BTEA
will end.

###  **Qualifying period for BTEA**

You must have been getting a qualifying social welfare payment for at least:

  * **3 months for Further Level courses** (78 paid or credited days of unemployment) 
  * **9 months for Higher Level courses** (234 paid or credited days of unemployment) 
  * **12 months for the Professional Masters in Education** (312 paid or credited days of unemployment 

You must be getting the qualifying payment **immediately** before you start
the course.

####  **Meeting the qualifying period**

You don’t have to have been getting your qualifying payment continuously. Time
spent on other qualifying social welfare payments (see ‘Qualifying social
welfare payments for BTEA’ above) which is not broken by more than 12 months
can be linked to help you meet the qualifying period required.

Time spent on some education, training, work placement and activation support
schemes, which is not broken by more than 12 months, can be taken into account
to meet the qualifying period.

Time spent on the following payments and schemes count towards the qualifying
period:

  * [ Back to Work Enterprise Allowance ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/social-welfare-payments-and-work/back-to-work-enterprise-allowance/)
  * [ Beneficiaries of Temporary Protection ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/moving-country/asylum-seekers-and-refugees/the-asylum-process-in-ireland/temporary-protection-directive/) (since March 2024)

  * [ Full-time FET (formerly FÁS) training courses ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/education/further-education-and-training/training-courses/)

  * [ Rural Social Scheme ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/farming-and-fishing/rural-social-scheme/)
  * [ Tús ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/employment/unemployment-and-redundancy/employment-support-schemes/tus/)
  * [ Workplace Placement Experience Programme (WPEP) ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/employment/unemployment-and-redundancy/employment-support-schemes/work-placement-experience-programme/)
  * [ Short Term Enterprise Allowance ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/social-welfare-payments-and-work/short-term-enterprise-allowance/)
  * [ Supplementary Welfare Allowance (SWA) ](/en/social-welfare/supplementary-welfare-schemes/supplementary-welfare-allow/)
  * [ Youth Employment Support Scheme (YESS) ](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/5afe0f-operational-guidelines-back-to-education-allowance/#criteria-and-qualifying-eligibility)
  * [ COVID-19 Pandemic Unemployment Payment ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/unemployed-people/covid19-pandemic-unemployment-payment/)
  * [ Youthreach ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/education/further-education-and-training/youthreach/) (if you establish an entitlement to a qualifying payment before or after completing the programme) 

If you’re an ex-offender and you have an entitlement to a qualifying payment,
your time spent in prison counts towards the qualifying period.

####  **Statutory redundancy and BTEA**

If you have been awarded [ statutory redundancy
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/employment/unemployment-and-
redundancy/redundancy/redundancy-payments/) and are entitled to a qualifying
social welfare payment immediately before you start the course, you can get
immediate access to BTEA without any waiting period.

You must take part in the BTEA scheme within one year of getting statutory
redundancy and meet all the other conditions.

###  **BTEA age limits**

To qualify for BTEA, you must be at least aged 21 (or at least aged 24 for a
Higher Level postgraduate course).

However, you may qualify for BTEA if you are aged between 18 and 20 and:

  * Have been out of the formal education system for at least 2 years, and 
  * Are getting [ Jobseeker's Allowance ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/unemployed-people/jobseekers-allowance/) or [ Jobseeker's Benefit ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/unemployed-people/jobseekers-benefit/) for the required period (see ‘Qualifying period for BTEA‘ above) 

You may also qualify for BTEA if you are 18 or over (or 24 or over for the
postgraduate options), if you are getting one of the below payments:

  * [ Blind Pension ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/disability-and-illness/blind-persons-pension/)
  * [ Disability Allowance ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/disability-and-illness/disability-allowance/)
  * [ Invalidity Pension ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/disability-and-illness/invalidity-pension/)
  * [ Incapacity Supplement ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/disability-and-illness/disablement-benefit/)
  * [ Carer’s Allowance ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/carers/carers-allowance/)
  * [ One-Parent Family Payment ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/families-and-children/one-parent-family-payment/)

You must have been getting these payments for the required period (see
‘Qualifying period for BTEA‘ above).

###  **Unemployment or illness credits**

You may qualify for BTEA on a non-payment basis if you are:

  * Signing on for unemployment credits, or 
  * Submitting medical certificates for illness credits for the required period of time (either 3, 9, or 12 months, or 2 years, depending on your course) 

This means you do not get a weekly Back to Education Allowance. You continue
to be awarded [ credited contributions
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-
system/social-insurance-prsi/credited-social-insurance-contributions/) while
you are taking part in the BTEA scheme.

If you take part in the BTEA scheme on a non-payment basis, you can also apply
for a [ student grant ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/education/third-
level-education/fees-and-supports-for-third-level-education/student-grant-
scheme/) , to be assessed for both the fee and maintenance component of the
grant.

###  **Qualified adults**

If you’re married or in a relationship, both you and your partner can get BTEA
while taking an approved course.

If you are [ a qualified adult ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-
welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/claiming-a-social-welfare-
payment/claiming-an-increase-in-your-social-welfare-payment-for-an-adult-
dependant/) , you can get BTEA if you:

  * Establish an entitlement to a qualifying payment in your own right, and 
  * Meet the other criteria needed to qualify for BTEA 

The rate you get is based on your entitlement. You can use time spent as a
qualified adult, as well as time getting your own qualifying payment, towards
the qualifying period for BTEA. The claims must not be broken by more than 12
months.

###  **Proof of course and change of circumstances**

You must provide a certificate from the school or college confirming your
registration, commencement, and attendance at the course. You must give this
information to the Department of Social Protection (DSP) before your BTEA
payment can start.

During the academic year, you may be asked to prove that you are still taking
part in the course.

If you change from a jobseeker's payment to BTEA, you do not need to [ sign on
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/unemployed-
people/signing-on/) while you are getting BTEA.

####  **Change of circumstances**

If your circumstances change (for example, if you stop attending your course
or start working part-time), you must tell the DSP immediately.

Any change of circumstance may affect:

  * Whether you are eligible for your qualifying payment, or 
  * The value of your BTEA payment 

##  BTEA, other social welfare schemes, and work

###  **Can I get BTEA while on another social welfare scheme?**

If you get a Back to Education Allowance (BTEA), you cannot work full-time or
be involved in the following schemes:

  * [ Community Employment ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/employment/unemployment-and-redundancy/employment-support-schemes/community-employment-scheme/)
  * [ Tús ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/employment/unemployment-and-redundancy/employment-support-schemes/tus/)
  * [ Rural Social Scheme ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/farming-and-fishing/rural-social-scheme/)
  * [ Part-time Job Incentive Scheme ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/social-welfare-payments-and-work/part-time-job-incentive-scheme/)
  * [ JobsPlus ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/employment/unemployment-and-redundancy/employment-support-schemes/jobsplus/)
  * [ Wage Subsidy Scheme (WSS) ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/employment/employment-and-disability/wage-subsidy-scheme-for-people-with-disabilities/)
  * [ Work Placement Experience Programme (WPEP) ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/employment/unemployment-and-redundancy/employment-support-schemes/work-placement-experience-programme/)
  * [ Vocational Training Opportunities Scheme (VTOS) ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/education/further-education-and-training/vocational-training-opportunities-scheme/)
  * ETB training programmes 
  * [ Youthreach ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/education/further-education-and-training/youthreach/)
  * Any other employment, training scheme or programme operated by the National Learning Network 

If you get [ Working Family Payment (WFP)
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/families-and-
children/working-family-payment/) , you are not eligible for BTEA.

###  **Can I work part-time?**

While you cannot work full-time, you may work part-time.

If you are getting BTEA and start work during the academic year, you will be
assessed under the rules that apply to your primary payment (see ‘Qualifying
social welfare payments for BTEA’ above). This includes the [ means test
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-
system/means-test-for-social-welfare-payments/means-test/) , and applies to
new applicants and people returning to BTEA after a break.

If you qualify for BTEA from a jobseeker’s payment, you can work any number of
days each week during the academic year. However, you must still meet the
other conditions of your primary payment (for example, you must pass a [ means
test if you get Jobseeker’s Allowance
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-
system/means-test-for-social-welfare-payments/means-test-for-jobseekers-
allowance/) ).

###  **Summer period between academic years**

####  **If you were getting a jobseeker’s payment**

If you were getting a jobseeker’s payment before going back to education, you
are not paid BTEA during the summer months between academic years.

Your Intreo Centre will contact you in March or April to ask the date of last
attendance for the current academic year, and you will not be paid BTEA beyond
this date. However, you may get BTEA during the summer if you are on work
placement or work experience that is an essential part of your course.

You will get BTEA again from the start of the new academic year, if you are
still eligible.

If you can’t find work during the summer, you may be entitled to [ Jobseeker's
Benefit ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/unemployed-
people/jobseekers-benefit/) or [ Jobseeker's Allowance
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/unemployed-
people/jobseekers-allowance/) (you must [ meet all of the conditions
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/unemployed-
people/rules-for-getting-a-jobseekers-payment/) ). If you claim Jobseeker’s
Allowance and work part-time, your earnings are assessed against your
Jobseeker’s Allowance.

####  **If you were getting certain other payments**

Your BTEA will continue to be paid during the summer if:

  * You were getting [ One-Parent Family Payment ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/families-and-children/one-parent-family-payment/) , [ Jobseeker's Transitional payment ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/unemployed-people/jobseekers-transitional-payment/) , or a disability payment before going back to education, **and**
  * You are returning to an approved course and are progressing in your education 

If you work during the summer, your means from work are assessed using the
rules that apply to the original payment.

If you stop work or your work pattern changes, you should [ tell your local
Intreo Centre ](https://www.gov.ie/en/directory/category/e1f4b5-intreo-
offices/) so your case can be reassessed.

##  How much is the BTEA?

Your weekly BTEA rate is equal to your previous social welfare payment (see
‘Qualifying social welfare payments for BTEA’ above). You may also qualify for
increases for a [ qualified adult
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-
system/claiming-a-social-welfare-payment/claiming-an-increase-in-your-social-
welfare-payment-for-an-adult-dependant/) and [ qualified children
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-
system/claiming-a-social-welfare-payment/claiming-and-increase-in-your-
payment-for-a-child-dependant/) .

You must have established an entitlement to a qualifying payment immediately
before starting BTEA, even if you were previously on an employment or training
scheme.

If you are aged under 25 and getting a [ reduced Jobseeker's Allowance payment
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/unemployed-
people/jobseekers-allowance/#28a767) because of your age, your payment will
increase to €232. Any means that you have will be deducted from this rate.

You can get your BTEA paid directly to your bank account. It is paid for the
duration of the course.

###  **Cost of Education Allowance**

You get an annual Cost of Education Allowance of €500 if you are getting BTEA
and you have a dependent child.

The maximum Cost of Education Allowance available per household is €500, even
if you and a qualified adult both get BTEA.

You cannot get the Cost of Education Allowance if you are:

  * On the [ Part-Time Education Option ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/back-to-education/part-time-education-option/) , including Springboard+ and ICT skills courses 
  * Studying a full-time [ Springboard+ or Human Capital Initiative Pillar 1 ](https://www.gov.ie/en/service/418e3f-back-to-education-allowance/#springboard-and-human-capital-initiative-courses) course 
  * On a Skillnet Ireland course 

###  **Keeping your extra benefits**

If you qualify for the Back to Education Allowance, you can keep your
entitlement to any extra benefits you already have (for example, [ Fuel
Allowance ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/extra-social-
welfare-benefits/fuel-allowance/) or [ Rent Supplement
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/supplementary-welfare-
schemes/rent-supplement/) ).

However, any increase in income may affect your entitlement to Rent Supplement
or the amount of supplement you get. For example, this can happen if you have
additional income from part-time work.

##  How to apply for BTEA

You must apply for BTEA before your course starts, or within 30 days of the
course starting.

To apply for BTEA, you must:

  * Complete the [ Back to Education Allowance application form (BTE1) (pdf) ](https://www.gov.ie/en/form/92351d-back-to-education-allowance-bte1/)
  * Be recommended for BTEA by a DSP Employment Personal Advisor or Job Coach (if you are a jobseeker making a new BTEA claim) 
  * Get written confirmation that you are registered as a full-time day student from the college registrar or admission officer 
  * Send your application to the section in DSP that deals with your primary payment (see ‘Where to apply for BTEA’ below) 

You will not get a BTEA payment until the DSP gets the confirmation letter
from your course provider.

###  **Make an appeal**

The Back to Education Allowance is a non-statutory scheme. This means you
cannot appeal the decision to the Social Welfare Appeals Office.

However, if you are not satisfied with a decision, you can request a review by
an officer in the relevant social welfare office or section. You should
include any new evidence to support the review. You must do this in writing
within 21 days.

##  Where to apply for BTEA

You can download and fill in the [ Back to Education Allowance application
form (BTE1) (pdf) ](https://www.gov.ie/en/form/92351d-back-to-education-
allowance-bte1/) . You can also get a copy of the form from your local Intreo
centre.

Your qualifying payment determines [ where you should send your application
form for BTEA ](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/5afe0f-operational-
guidelines-back-to-education-allowance/#appendix-1) .

For example, if you are getting a jobseeker's payment, Farm Assist or a One-
Parent Family payment, you should return your application form to [ your local
Intreo Centre ](http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/List-of-Social-Welfare-Local-
