##  What is Illness Benefit?

Illness Benefit is a weekly payment that you may get if you cannot work
because you are sick or ill.

To get Illness Benefit, you must meet the social insurance (PRSI) conditions –
see ‘How to qualify for Illness Benefit’ below.

You should always apply for Illness Benefit if you are medically certified as
unfit for work. Even if you don’t qualify for the weekly payment, you may get
PRSI credited contributions which can help you qualify for future social
welfare payments.

If you don’t qualify for Illness Benefit or while you are waiting for a
decision on your claim for Illness Benefit, you may get a [ Supplementary
Welfare Allowance ](/en/social-welfare/supplementary-welfare-
schemes/supplementary-welfare-allow/) .

Illness Benefit can be paid abroad in some situations. Find out about the [
rules for getting Illness Benefit abroad ](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-
welfare-system/claiming-a-social-welfare-payment/going-abroad-and-social-
welfare-payments/) .

####  Employer policy on sick pay and Illness Benefit

You should apply for Illness Benefit while you are out sick from work, whether
your employer pays you or not.

Illness Benefit is not linked to your employer's policy on [ pay for sick
leave ](/en/employment/employment-rights-and-conditions/leave-and-
holidays/sick-leave-and-sick-pay/) . However, if you get sick pay from work
and Illness Benefit, you should ask your employer about any arrangements in
place for this.

##  Statutory Sick Pay and Illness Benefit

From 1 Jan 2024, [ Statutory Sick Pay (SSP) increased
](/en/employment/employment-rights-and-conditions/leave-and-holidays/sick-
leave-and-sick-pay/) from 3 to 5 days a year. You cannot get Illness Benefit
on the days that you get SSP.

If your first illness in 2024 is less than 5 days and you qualify for
Statutory Sick Pay, you don't need to apply for Illness Benefit. For illnesses
lasting more than 5 days, Illness Benefit starts from day 6.

If you use your 5 days of SSP in 2024 and you become ill again in the same
year, you'll get Illness Benefit from day 4 of your illness, which is after
the normal 3 waiting days.

See [ examples of how SSP affects Illness Benefit
](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/8c924-illness-benefit-and-statutory-sick-
leave-in-2024/#examples) on gov.ie.

##  COVID-19 and Illness Benefit

The COVID-19 enhanced Illness Benefit ended on Friday, 30 September 2022.
After 30 September 2022, if you are advised to self-isolate due to COVID-19
and have a medical certificate from your GP, you can apply for normal Illness
Benefit.

##  How to qualify for Illness Benefit

To qualify for Illness Benefit, you must:

  * Be under pension age 
  * Be medically certified as unfit for work by a medical doctor (GP) 
  * Have enough social insurance (PRSI) contributions – see below 
  * Apply within 6 weeks of becoming ill 

There is no payment for the first 3 days of illness. These are known as ‘
_waiting days_ ’ (Sunday is not counted as a waiting day.) There are no
waiting days if you were getting certain other social welfare payments within
3 days of the start of your illness.

**Pension age**

If you [ defer claiming your State Pension (Contributory)
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/social-welfare-
payments/older-and-retired-people/deferring-your-state-pension-contributory/)
to after age 66 and you meet the conditions of Illness Benefit, you can still
claim Illness Benefit. You will not get credited contributions while getting
Illness Benefit at age 66 or over.

###  Social insurance (PRSI) contributions

To qualify for Illness Benefit, you must meet 2 social insurance (PRSI)
conditions:

You must have at least 104 weeks of PRSI contributions paid since you first
started work

**and**

39 weeks of PRSI contributions paid or credited in the relevant tax year, of
which 13 must be **paid** contributions. If you do not have 13 paid
contributions in the relevant tax year, then 13 paid contributions in one of
the following tax years can be used instead:

  * Either of the 2 tax years before the relevant tax year 
  * The last complete tax year (before the year in which your claim for Illness Benefit begins) 
  * The current tax year 

**or**

26 weeks of PRSI contributions paid in the relevant tax year **and** 26 weeks
of PRSI contributions paid in the tax year immediately before the relevant tax
year.

The relevant tax year is the second-last complete tax year before the year in
which your claim for Illness Benefit begins. For example, if your Illness
Benefit claim begins in 2024, the relevant tax year is 2022.

  * Only PRSI contributions paid at class A, E, H and P count towards Illness Benefit. 
  * If you were getting long-term Jobseeker's Allowance, Invalidity Pension, Carer's Allowance or Carer's Benefit immediately before applying for Illness Benefit, you do not need to have 13 paid contributions. 
  * If you were getting Occupational Injury Benefit (OIB) immediately before applying for Illness Benefit, you may use the tax year that applied to your OIB claim or the tax year that applies to your Illness Benefit claim, whichever is of greatest benefit to you. 

To help you qualify for Illness Benefit, you may use your Irish PRSI
contributions and your [ social insurance contributions from a country covered
by EU Regulations ](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/claiming-a-
social-welfare-payment/social-insurance-contributions-from-abroad/) or the
United Kingdom (UK). Your last social insurance contribution must be paid in
Ireland.

##  How long is Illness Benefit paid?

Illness Benefit is paid for a maximum of:

  * 2 years (624 payment days) if you have at least 260 weeks of social insurance contributions paid since you first started work 

**or**

  * 1 year (312 payment days) if you have between 104 and 259 weeks of social insurance contributions paid since you first started work 

If you claim Illness Benefit (IB) within 26 weeks of your last IB claim, it is
treated as one claim. For example, John was getting IB for 6 weeks. He
returned to work for 10 weeks. He got ill again and claimed IB for a further 6
weeks. His IB claims are treated as one claim. This means he has used up 12
weeks of IB.

If you have used up your entitlement to Illness Benefit and return to work,
you must have a minimum of 13 PRSI contributions paid before you can requalify
for Illness Benefit (you must also meet the other qualifying conditions for
Illness Benefit).

If you were getting Illness Benefit for 1 year only, you may requalify with
fewer than 13 contributions, if additional contributions bring your total PRSI
contributions paid up to 260 (for example, if you had 250 contributions when
your Illness Benefit expired, you could work and pay 10 contributions to
requalify).

Before your payment is due to stop, you will be contacted by the Department of
Social Protection (DSP) telling you when your payment will stop and giving you
information on your options, for example:

  * If you are ill and likely to be permanently incapable of work and satisfy the PRSI conditions, you may get [ Invalidity Pension ](/en/social-welfare/disability-and-illness/invalidity-pension/)
  * If you do not get Invalidity Pension and you have a disability that is expected to last for a year or more, you may get a [ Disability Allowance ](/en/social-welfare/disability-and-illness/disability-allowance/)
  * If you do not qualify for any other payments and your income is too low to meet your needs, you may get a [ Supplementary Welfare Allowance ](/en/social-welfare/supplementary-welfare-schemes/supplementary-welfare-allow/)

###  A review of your entitlement to Illness Benefit

Your Illness Benefit claim will be reviewed from time to time and you may be
asked to attend for a [ medical assessment
](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/23858a-operational-guidelines-medical-
assessments/) . The assessment is carried out by a Medical Assessor - this is
a doctor employed by the Department of Social Protection.

The Medical Assessor will give their opinion on whether you are fit for work.
You must attend for a medical assessment when asked, or your Illness Benefit
will be suspended.

If your Illness Benefit is stopped, you have a right to [ appeal the decision
](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/social-welfare-appeals/) . If
you are getting credited contributions only and these are stopped, you can
seek a review of the decision, but you do not have a right to appeal it.

##  Work and Illness Benefit

You cannot work while you are getting Illness Benefit.

If you are getting Illness Benefit for at least 6 months, you can apply for [
Partial Capacity Benefit (PCB) ](/en/social-welfare/disability-and-
illness/partial-capacity-benefit/) .

The PCB scheme allows you to return to work and continue to get a social
welfare payment, if you have a reduced capacity to work. A Medical Assessor (a
doctor employed by the Department of Social Protection) will assess the
restriction on your capacity for work.

The rate of PCB paid is based on this assessment.

You cannot start work until you have written approval from the DSP.

You must get written approval from the Illness Benefit section of the DSP
before you start any training or educational course or voluntary work.

##  Illness Benefit and other social welfare payments

Sometimes you can get Illness Benefit and another social welfare payment at
the same time. For example, you may get help under the [ Supplementary Welfare
Allowance Scheme ](/en/social-welfare/supplementary-welfare-
schemes/supplementary-welfare-allowance-scheme/) or the [ Back to School
Clothing and Footwear Allowance ](/en/social-welfare/families-and-
children/back-to-school-clothing-and-footwear-allowance/) , if you meet the
qualifying conditions.

The social welfare payments that can be paid with Illness Benefit are:

**Illness Benefit and other social welfare payments** **Blind Pension** |  Blind Pension and Illness Benefit can be paid at the same time, if you meet the qualifying conditions for both.   
---|---  
**Carer's Allowance (half-rate)** |  Illness Benefit and Half-rate Carer's Allowance can be paid at the same time, if you meet the qualifying conditions for both.  If you are getting an increase in your Illness Benefit for an adult dependant, your adult dependant can get a Half-rate Carer's Allowance if they meet the qualifying conditions.   
**Disablement Benefit** |  Disablement Benefit and Illness can be paid at the same time, if you meet the qualifying conditions for both and your Disablement Benefit payment does not include an Incapacity Supplement.   
**Domiciliary Care Allowance/Carer's Support Grant** |  Domiciliary Care Allowance and the Carer's Support Grant can be paid with Illness Benefit.   
**Working Family Payment (WFP)** |  If you are getting Working Family Payment (WFP) and become ill, you can continue to get WFP with Illness Benefit for up to 36 days (6 weeks). This applies to each separate period of illness.   
**Back to Work Family Dividend (BTWFD)** **  
** |  Back to Work Family Dividend can continue to be paid with Illness Benefit for 36 days (6 weeks). This applies to each separate period of illness.   
**Widow’s, Widower’s or Surviving Civil Partner’s Pension (including occupational widow’s/widower’s pensions) and One-Parent Family Payment, Deserted Wife's Allowance/Benefit or Prisoner’s Wife's Allowance** |  If you are getting any of these payments at the full rate, you cannot get Illness Benefit at the same time. However, if you are getting a reduced rate of one of these payments and become ill, you may get a reduced rate of Illness Benefit (so that both payments together give you the maximum rate of Illness Benefit that you are entitled to).   
**Back to School Clothing and Footwear Allowance (BSCFA)** |  BSCFA and Illness Benefit can be paid at the same time, if you meet the qualifying conditions for both.   
  
##  How much Illness Benefit will I get?

Your weekly rate of Illness Benefit (IB) will depend on your **average weekly
earnings** in the relevant tax year.

Average weekly earnings are your gross earnings (without deductions) in the
relevant tax year divided by the actual number of weeks you worked in that
year. If your Illness Benefit claim begins in 2024, the relevant tax year is
2022.

If you had no earnings from work but got PUP in 2021, you will meet the
average weekly earnings requirement and get the maximum rate of Illness
Benefit. However, if you had earnings from work in 2021, your average weekly
earnings will be calculated by dividing your gross yearly earnings by the
number of paid contributions.

Usually, no payment is made for the first 3 days of illness.

**Weekly** **Illness Benefit rate in 2024**

**Average weekly earnings** |  **Personal rate** |  **Increase for an adult dependant**  
---|---|---  
€300 or more  |  €232.00  |  €154.00   
€220 - €299.99  |  €181.70  |  €99.70   
€150 - €219.99  |  €149.60  |  €99.70   
Less than €150  |  €104.10  |  €99.70   
  
###  **If you transfer from Jobseeker's Allowance**

If you transfer from a long-term [ Jobseeker's Allowance
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/unemployed-
people/jobseekers-allowance/) (paid for at least 390 days) at the maximum rate
to Illness Benefit, you can get the maximum rate of Illness Benefit. Your
Jobseeker's Allowance and Illness Benefit claim cannot be separated by more
than 3 days and you must have a minimum of 260 qualifying contributions.

###  Spouses, partners and children

You can get an increase in your payment for an [ adult dependant ](/en/social-
welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/claiming-a-social-welfare-
payment/claiming-an-increase-in-your-social-welfare-payment-for-an-adult-
dependant/) or [ child dependant ](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-
system/claiming-a-social-welfare-payment/claiming-and-increase-in-your-
payment-for-a-child-dependant/) if you meet certain conditions.

###  Taxation of Illness Benefit

Illness Benefit, both the personal rate and Increase for a Qualified Adult [
is taxable ](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/claiming-a-social-
welfare-payment/taxation-of-social-welfare-payments/) . Any increases for
child dependants is not taxed.

Illness Benefit is paid directly to you without any tax deducted. It is taxed
by reducing your tax credits and rate band. Whether you are employed or
unemployed, Revenue will take account of the amount of Illness Benefit paid to
you when they adjust your tax credits or review the tax of your spouse or
civil partner.

###  Transfer from Carer's Benefit or Carer’s Allowance

If you transfer from Illness Benefit to Carer's Benefit or Carer's Allowance
and then back to Illness Benefit, your Illness Benefit will not be paid at a
lower rate than that you were paid previously.

##  How to apply for Illness Benefit

You must apply for Illness Benefit within 6 weeks of becoming ill.

If you don't apply within 6 weeks, you may lose some of your payment. If there
is a good reason for a delay in applying, your payment may be backdated.

###  Online application

You should [ apply for Illness Benefit online at MyWelfare.ie
](https://services.mywelfare.ie/en/topics/health-disability-illness/illness-
benefit/) if you have:

  * A verified or basic MyGovID account, and 
  * A medical certificate from your GP 

If your GP completed the medical certificate online, you will get a copy of
the certificate for your records.

If your GP cannot complete the medical certificate online, you can get the
certificate from your GP and email it to [ illnessbenefit@welfare.ie
](mailto:illnessbenefit@welfare.ie) or post it – see ‘Freepost’ below.

###  Paper application form

You must get an Illness Benefit claim form (IB1) and a medical certificate
called a ‘Certificate of incapacity for work’ from your family doctor (GP).
You fill in the IB1 form and freepost it to the Department of Social
Protection - see 'Freepost' address below.

Your GP can provide one medical certificate to cover the duration of your
illness. Some GPs can complete the medical certificate online. If your GP
cannot send it online, you will get a paper medical certificate which you must
fill in with your personal details and freepost it with your IB1 form to the
Department.

You do not pay for the ‘Certificate of incapacity for work’ as the Department
pays the doctor an agreed fee. However, you may have to pay for the doctor to
examine you.

**Hospital certs**

doctor to give you a pro forma letter which you can bring to your GP who then

incapacity for work) with no charge. If you’re still in hospital, a family
member can bring the pro forma letter to your GP on your behalf.
