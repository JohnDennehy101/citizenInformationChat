##  What is elder abuse?

Abuse can take place in any situation and any person is at risk. A vulnerable
person is someone who may be restricted in capacity to guard themselves
against harm or exploitation or to report such harm or exploitation.

Abuse can be perpetrated (carried out) by a range of people, such as
strangers, institutions, or family members. It may happen when an older person
or a person with a disability lives alone or with a relative. It may also
happen in residential or day-care settings, in hospitals, home support
services and other places assumed to be safe, or in public places.

Elder abuse is the abuse of someone aged 65 or over and it happens in a
relationship where there is an expectation of trust. Elder abuse can be a
single or repeated act, or a lack of action, which causes harm or distress to
the older person, or that violates their human and civil rights.

Find information on recognising the signs of child abuse, and the protection
of vulnerable children, in our page [ Child abuse and child protection
](/en/birth-family-relationships/services-and-supports-for-children/child-
abuse-and-protection/) .

##  Types of elder abuse

There are different types of elder abuse. It can be deliberate, or it can be
caused by a lack of knowledge, or omission of care (neglect). An older person
may experience more than one form of abuse at any given time.

**Types of elder abuse** **Types of abuse** |  **Description**  
---|---  
Psychological abuse  |  Emotional abuse, threats of harm or abandonment, deprivation of contact, humiliation, blaming, controlling, intimidation, coercion, harassment, verbal abuse, isolation or withdrawal from services or supportive networks   
Physical abuse  |  Slapping, pushing, hitting, kicking, misuse of medication, inappropriate restraint (including physical and chemical restraint) or sanctions   
Financial or material abuse  |  Theft, fraud, exploitation, pressure in connection with wills, property or inheritance, or financial transactions, or the misuse or misappropriation of property, possessions or benefits   
Neglect  |  Self-neglect and acts of omission including ignoring medical or physical care needs, the withholding of the necessities of life, such as medication, adequate nutrition and heating   
Discriminatory abuse  |  Ageism, racism, sexism, abuse based on a person’s disability, and other forms of harassment, slurs or similar treatment   
Institutional abuse  |  Poor standards of care, rigid routines, inadequate responses to complex needs occurring in residential care, nursing homes, acute hospitals, and in-patient settings   
Sexual abuse  |  Rape and sexual assault or sexual acts to which the older adult has not consented, or could not consent, or into which they were forced to consent   
  
You can also watch a video from Safeguarding Ireland that explains [ the
different types of abuse and what you can do about it
](https://youtu.be/siaW1JqBE-Q) .

##  Reporting a concern

Safeguarding is about putting measures in place to help people who might be at
risk to protect themselves from harm or abuse. The HSE has [ Safeguarding and
Protection Teams
](https://www.hse.ie/eng/about/who/socialcare/safeguardingvulnerableadults/safeguarprotectteams.html)
in every region of the country. These teams are responsible for adult
safeguarding within services for older people and services for people with
disabilities. Contact your nearest [ HSE Safeguarding and Protection Team
](https://www.hse.ie/eng/about/who/socialcare/safeguardingvulnerableadults/safeguarprotectteams.html)
if you, or someone you know, is a victim of abuse.

Alternatively, contact your [ local health centre
](http://www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/2/healthcentres/) , your GP, [ public
health nurse ](/en/health/health-services/care-in-your-community/public-
health-nurses/) or the [ Garda Síochana
](http://www.garda.ie/Stations/Default.aspx) and talk to someone about what
has been happening.

You can also contact the HSE Information Line on 1800 700 700. Or, if
confidentiality is required, phone the Garda confidential line on 1800 666
111.

**In an emergency, where a person is at immediate risk, you should contact the
Garda Síochana or Emergency Services on 999 or 112.**
