##  What was the Home Renovation Incentive?

The [ Home Renovation Incentive (HRI)
](http://www.revenue.ie/en/tax/it/reliefs/hri/index.html) was a scheme that
let people claim tax relief on repairs, renovations or improvement works
completed between 2013 and 2018.

It was available to homeowners, landlords and local authority tenants for work
on their main home or a rental property.

The work must have been completed by a tax-compliant contractor and have been
subject to 13.5% VAT.

The qualifying work must have cost between €4,405 and €30,000 before VAT. The
minimum credit you could get was €595 and the maximum was €4,050.

##  HRI claims and what happens to excess relief?

**The HRI scheme is closed and 2018 was the last tax year you could claim the
relief for.**

You claimed the relief on the HRI online system. In general, the tax credit
was paid over the 2 years following the year the work was carried out and paid
for. So, people who got the work done in 2018 were paid half the relief in
2019, and the other half in 2020.

However, if you didn’t pay enough income tax to benefit from the relief in the
years you were due it, the relief is carried forward every year until you can
fully use it.
