#  Benefits for people who are sick or have a disability

  * Introduction 

##  Introduction

There are a number of social welfare payments for people who are sick or who
have a disability. Payments are made either by the Department of Social
Protection or the Health Service Executive (HSE). To qualify for a social
welfare payment because you are sick or have a disability you must be
certified as sick or disabled by a doctor.

You can qualify for certain payments if you are sick for just a short time.
For other payments you need to show that you have an illness or disability
that will last longer than one year. Some social welfare disability payments
are based on your [ PRSI contributions ](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-
welfare-system/social-insurance-prsi/social-insurance/) . If you do not have
enough PRSI contributions you may qualify for a similar social assistance
payment, however, you must be [ habitually resident ](/en/social-
welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/social-assistance-payments/habitual-
residence-condition/) and pass a [ means test ](/en/social-welfare/irish-
social-welfare-system/means-test-for-social-welfare-payments/means-test/) .

Illness Benefit is intended for those with a short-term illness. Invalidity
Pension is a long-term payment. [ Illness Benefit ](/en/social-
welfare/disability-and-illness/illness-benefit/) and [ Invalidity Pension
](/en/social-welfare/disability-and-illness/invalidity-pension/) are both
social insurance payments based on your PRSI contributions. [ COVID-19
enhanced Illness Benefit ](/en/social-welfare/disability-and-
illness/covid19-enhanced-illness-benefit/) is paid if a worker is told to
self-isolate, restrict their movements or is diagnosed with COVID-19.

[ Partial Capacity Benefit ](/en/social-welfare/disability-and-
illness/partial-capacity-benefit/) is a scheme which allows you to return to
work (if you have reduced capacity to work) and continue to receive a payment
from the Department of Social Protection. To qualify for Partial Capacity
Benefit you need to be in receipt of either Illness Benefit (for a minimum of
6 months) or Invalidity Pension.

[ Disability Allowance ](/en/social-welfare/disability-and-illness/disability-
allowance/) is a long-term social assistance payment for those aged 16-65 with
a disability expected to last at least one year. [ Blind Pension ](/en/social-
welfare/disability-and-illness/blind-persons-pension/) is also a long-term
social assistance payment. If you are blind or have low vision and you are
getting Blind Pension or Disability Allowance you may also qualify for [ Blind
Welfare Allowance ](/en/health/health-services/health-services-for-people-
with-disabilities/blind-welfare-allowance/) .

The [ Occupational Injuries Benefit Scheme ](/en/social-welfare/disability-
and-illness/occupational-injuries-benefit-overview/) applies to work related
injuries and diseases. If you are injured at work (or traveling directly to or
from it) or have contracted a disease due to the type of work you do you may
qualify for benefits under this scheme.

If you are sick and do not qualify for any payment you may be eligible for [
Supplementary Welfare Allowance ](/en/social-welfare/supplementary-welfare-
schemes/supplementary-welfare-allow/) .

Generally, social welfare payments are made up of a personal payment for
yourself and extra amounts for your dependent spouse, civil partner or
cohabitant and your dependent children.

###  Other payments

If you are getting a social welfare payment you may qualify for additional
financial support because of your illness or disability, for example, under
the [ Supplementary Welfare Allowance Scheme ](/en/social-
welfare/supplementary-welfare-schemes/) you can apply for [ a Heating
Supplement ](/en/social-welfare/supplementary-welfare-schemes/diet-and-
heating-supplements/) , if you have exceptional heating expenses due to ill-
health or infirmity.

You could be eligible for the [ Long Term Illness Scheme ](/en/health/drugs-
and-medicines/long-term-illness-scheme/) or a [ medical card
](/en/health/medical-cards-and-gp-visit-cards/medical-card/) or a [ GP Visit
Card ](/en/health/medical-cards-and-gp-visit-cards/gp-visit-cards/) . Apply to
your Local Health Office in the Health Service Executive. [ Find out more
about health services for people with disabilities
](http://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/health/health_services/health_services_for_people_with_disabilities/)
.

There are [ concessions for disabled drivers and passengers ](/en/travel-and-
recreation/transport-and-disability/) and [ local authority grants to adapt
your home ](/en/housing/housing-grants-and-schemes/housing-supports-for-older-
people-and-people-with-disabilities/housing-adaptation-grant-for-people-with-
disability/) . There are also [ tax benefits available to people that are sick
or have a disability ](/en/money-and-tax/tax/tax-credits-and-reliefs-for-
people-with-disabilities/) .

If someone is providing you with full-time care they may qualify for a [
carer's payment ](/en/social-welfare/carers/payments-to-carers/) .

###  Recovery of personal injury-related benefits and assistance

Under the [ Recovery of Certain Benefits and Assistance (RBA) Scheme
](http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/Recovery-of-Benefits-and-Assistance.aspx) the
Department of Social Protection can recover the value of certain illness-
related social welfare payments from compensation awards made following non-
fatal personal injuries claims. The value of the social welfare payments are
recovered from the compensator and not from the injured person who is getting
a social welfare payment.

The payments that can be recovered under the RBA Scheme are:

  * [ Illness Benefit ](/en/social-welfare/disability-and-illness/illness-benefit/)
  * [ Partial Capacity Benefit ](/en/social-welfare/disability-and-illness/partial-capacity-benefit/)
  * [ Injury Benefit ](/en/social-welfare/disability-and-illness/injury-benefit/)
  * [ Incapacity Supplement ](/en/social-welfare/disability-and-illness/occupational-injuries-benefit-overview/)
  * [ Invalidity Pension ](/en/social-welfare/disability-and-illness/invalidity-pension/)
  * [ Disability Allowance ](/en/social-welfare/disability-and-illness/disability-allowance/)

Compensation payments may be made as a result of a court or Personal Injuries
Assessment Board (PIAB) order or as a result of an agreement between the 2
parties. In both cases [ a statement of recoverable benefits and assistance
](http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/Recovery-of-Benefits-and-Assistance-
scheme.aspx#_Toc393459075) must be requested by a compensator or the PIAB from
the RBA Section in the Department of Social Protection using the [ RBA01 form
(pdf) ](http://www.welfare.ie/en/pdf/Recovery-of-Benefits-and-Assistance.pdf)
.

###  The National Advocacy Service

The [ National Advocacy Service (NAS) ](https://advocacy.ie/) provides

particular people who are isolated from their community and services, have
communication differences, are inappropriately accommodated, live in
residential services or attend day services and have limited supports.
