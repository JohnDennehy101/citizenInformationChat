##  What is the Blind Pension?

The Blind Pension is a means-tested payment paid to people who are blind or
have low vision and who are [ habitually resident
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-
system/social-assistance-payments/habitual-residence-condition/) in Ireland.
It is paid by the Department of Social Protection.

The payment is made up of a personal rate for you, and extra amounts for a
qualified adult (such as your spouse) and any child dependants (see 'Rate of
Blind Pension' below).

If you get a Blind Pension, you may also qualify for the [ Blind Welfare
Allowance paid by the HSE
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/health/health-services/health-
services-for-people-with-disabilities/blind-welfare-allowance/) .

If you get Blind Pension and another source of income, you may have to pay
tax. Read about [ taxation of social welfare payments
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-
system/claiming-a-social-welfare-payment/taxation-of-social-welfare-payments/)
.

###  **Other benefits**

If you get Blind Pension, you automatically get a [ Free Travel Pass
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/social-welfare-
payments/extra-social-welfare-benefits/free-travel/) and a Companion Free
Travel Pass. This means you can travel on public transport in Ireland for
free. Your companion aged 16 or over can also travel with you for free.

You may also qualify for other benefits, such as:

  * The [ Living Alone Increase ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/social-welfare-payments/extra-social-welfare-benefits/living-alone-allowance/)
  * [ Fuel Allowance ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/social-welfare-payments/extra-social-welfare-benefits/fuel-allowance/)
  * The [ Household Benefits Package ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/social-welfare-payments/extra-social-welfare-benefits/household-benefits-package/) . 

##  Can I get Blind Pension?

To qualify for Blind Pension, you must:

  * Be blind or have low vision 
  * Be aged 18 or over, and under 66 
  * Be [ habitually resident ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/social-assistance-payments/habitual-residence-condition/) in Ireland 
  * Pass a ‘means test’ 

###  **Proof of blindness or low vision**

To qualify for Blind Pension, your vision must be impaired to the point that:

  * You can’t carry out any job where eyesight is essential, or 
  * You can’t continue working in your regular occupation. 

If you're registered with [ Vision Ireland ](https://vi.ie/) , this is usually
accepted as proof of your blindness.

However, if you're not registered with Vision Ireland, you must provide the
Department of Social Protection with a medical report from an ophthalmic
surgeon or optometrist.

##  Means test for Blind Pension

Blind Pension is a means-tested payment.

In a means test, the Department of Social Protection (DSP) looks at all your
sources of income. They also look at your spouse, civil partner, or
cohabitant’s income.

To qualify for Blind Pension, your weekly means must be €235.10 or less. Your
rate of Blind Pension may be reduced depending on your weekly means (see ‘Rate
of Blind Pension’ below).

The main items included in the means test for Blind Pension are:

####  **Cash income**

The DSP looks at your cash income (such as payment from work), that you or
your spouse, civil partner or cohabitant may have.

Some [ cash income may not be included in the means test
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-
system/means-test-for-social-welfare-payments/cash-income-not-included-in-the-
social-welfare-means-test/) .

####  **Capital**

Capital includes your savings, investments, shares, and any property you have
(but not your own home). The first €20,000 of your capital is not taken into
account for the means test for Blind Pension (€40,000 if you’re in a couple).

Read about [ capital not included in the means test
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-
system/means-test-for-social-welfare-payments/how-to-assess-your-means-from-
capital-for-social-welfare-payments/) .

####  **Maintenance**

The DSP looks at maintenance paid to you. Read more about [ how maintenance is
assessed as means ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-
welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/means-test-for-social-welfare-
payments/maintenance-and-social-welfare-payments/) .

###  **How income from work is assessed for Blind Pension**

You can earn €165 per week from work (including self-employed work) without it
affecting your payment. This is called an ‘income disregard’.

If you earn more than €165 per week from work, half of your earnings from €165
and €375 are not taken into account in the Blind Pension means test.

The DSP assesses all your earnings over €375 in full.

There are no ‘disregards’ for your spouse, civil partner, or cohabitant's
earnings. This means their income from work is assessed in full.

Read our page about [ how disability payments are affected by work
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/social-welfare-
payments/social-welfare-payments-and-work/disability-payments-and-work/) .

###  **Income from PhD scholarship**

PhD scholarship of up to €20,000 per year, for up to 4 years, is not taken
into account when you are assessed for Blind Pension.

###  **Income from the sale of your home**

The means test does not take into account up to €190,500 of the money you get
if you sell your home and:

  * Move to different accommodation (you can either buy or rent) 
  * Move in with someone who is caring for you and getting [ a carer's payment ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/social-welfare-payments/carers/payments-to-carers/)
  * Move to sheltered or special housing in the voluntary, co-operative, statutory, or private sectors 
  * Move into a [ registered private nursing home ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/health/health-services/health-services-for-older-people/regulation-residential-care-older-people/) . 

###  **If you’re in a couple**

If you are married, in a civil partnership, or cohabiting, your individual
means will be taken as half the joint means of you and your spouse or partner.

pension/#the-means-test) on Gov.ie.

###  **Increase for a qualified adult or child**

If you get an increase for a qualified adult or an increase for a qualified
child with your Blind Pension, you can also get an increase on the payments
listed above.

###  **Partial Capacity Benefit**

If you were getting Illness Benefit and transferred to Partial Capacity
Benefit (PCB), your PCB is not taken into account in the means test for Blind
Pension. However, your earnings from employment are taken into account and may
affect the amount of Blind Pension you get.

###  **One-Parent Family Payment**

If you qualify for [ One-Parent Family Payment (OFP)
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/social-welfare-
payments/families-and-children/one-parent-family-payment/) and Blind Pension,
you can get both payments at the full rate.

People who qualify for Blind Pension do not need to meet the child age
conditions for OFP. This means you can claim both Blind Pension and OFP
together until your youngest child is 16, including any increases for a
qualified child.

If you get Blind Pension and OFP, you [ cannot claim certain other benefits
](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/1cedd4-operational-guidelines-one-parent-
family-payment/#:~:text=Where%20a%20person%20is,Parents%20Benefit) .

##  When to apply for Blind Pension

###  **If you are under 18**

If you are under 18 and you are blind or have low vision, you should apply for
Blind Pension 3 months before your 18th birthday.

While you can't get Blind Pension until you are 18, you may qualify for [
Disability Allowance ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-
welfare/disability-and-illness/disability-allowance/) if you are 16 or over.

###  **If you are over 18**

If you become blind or develop low vision after you turn 18, you should apply
as soon as possible. This is important, as the Department of Social Protection
will only pay Blind Pension from the date they get your application.

You cannot get Blind Pension after your 66th birthday. Instead, you will be
invited to apply for a [ State Pension (Contributory)
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/older-and-retired-
people/state-pension-contributory/) or [ State Pension (Non-contributory)
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/older-and-retired-
people/state-pension-non-contributory/) .

###  **If you have a carer**

If you need full-time care, the person looking after you may qualify for [
Carer's Allowance ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-
welfare/social-welfare-payments/carers/carers-allowance/) or [ Carer's Benefit
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/social-welfare-
payments/carers/carers-benefit/) .

##  How to apply for Blind Pension

To apply for Blind Pension, download and complete [ application form (BP1)
(pdf) ](https://assets.gov.ie/8231/132f44f04ce947efb198924000e6173e.pdf) and
send it to the Department of Social Protection at the address below.

You can get a braille and audio cassette tape version of this application form
from [ Vision Ireland ](http://www.ncbi.ie/) .

You can also get the application form from [ your local Intreo Centre or
Social Welfare Branch Office
](https://www.gov.ie/en/directory/category/e1f4b5-intreo-offices/) and [ your
local Post Office ](https://www.anpost.com/Store-Locator) .

Staff in your local Intreo office can help you to complete the form and answer
any questions you may have.

###  **Supporting documents**

If you (and your spouse, civil partner, or cohabitant) were born and married
in Ireland, you don’t need to send your birth or marriage certificates. The
DSP already has access to this information.

However, if the marriage, civil partnership, or birth took place outside of
Ireland, you must provide an original copy of the birth certificates or
marriage certificate. The DSP does not accept photocopies.

If you are claiming an increase for a qualified child who is aged 18-22 and in
full-time education, you should also provide a letter from their college
confirming their attendance.

###  **Changes to your circumstances**

You must tell the Department of Social Protection if there are any [ changes
to your circumstances ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-
welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/claiming-a-social-welfare-payment/changes-
that-can-affect-your-social-welfare-payment/) while you are getting a Blind
Pension within 3 months of the change.

If your means or circumstances change, you may no longer qualify for the
payment or it may be reduced. This could mean that you have to [ repay an
over-payment ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/irish-
social-welfare-system/claiming-a-social-welfare-payment/social-welfare-
overpayments/) .

####  **If you get a job, but stop working within 12 months**

If you get a job while getting Blind Pension, your rate of payment may be
reduced or stopped (depending on your new weekly means).

If your Blind Pension is stopped, you can be fast-tracked back onto the
payment if you stop work within 12 months.

###  **Can I appeal a decision?**

If you are unhappy with a decision made about your claim for Blind Pension,
you can appeal it. Find out more about the [ social welfare appeals process
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-
system/social-welfare-appeals/) .
