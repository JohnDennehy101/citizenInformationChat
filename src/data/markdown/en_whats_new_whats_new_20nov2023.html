To request a late student grant application, you must [ complete a Late

People who have a submeter are now eligible for the [ Electricity Account
Credit ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/consumer/utilities/electricity-
account-credit/#31d1bf) . Previously, households with submeters were not
eligible (submeters are linked to a primary meter with an MPRN). A new [ low
usage threshold applies

account-credit/#33b71c) where households that use less than 150kWh a quarter
in 4 consecutive quarters will not be eligible for the credit.

Christmas leave from their accommodation
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/moving-country/asylum-seekers-and-

2023 to 8 January 2024.

On 13 November 2023, new regulations came into effect on [ monitoring and

  * Allow Gardaí to take fingerprints, palm-prints or photographs to confirm the identity of an offender 
  * Allow Gardaí to disclose information about people on the sex offender register where there is a serious risk to the public 
  * Ensure that the courts can stop an offender from working with children 

The [ Local Authority Home Loan
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/housing/owning-a-home/help-with-
buying-a-home/local-authority-mortgages/) is due to be extended in 2024, so
you will be able to use it to buy and renovate derelict and non-habitable
homes.

From 1 December 2023, social housing tenants who [ rent a room in their home
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/housing/owning-a-home/home-
owners/renting-a-room-in-your-home/) to a third-level student qualify for
rent-a-room relief.

](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/employment/employment-rights-and-
conditions/leave-and-holidays/sick-leave-and-sick-pay/) increases from 3 to 5
