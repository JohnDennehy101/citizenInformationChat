##  Introduction

Irish Water is responsible for the efficient supply of water to homes and
businesses. Funding for maintaining and improving the water supply
infrastructure (pipes, filtration and disinfection systems) comes from the
Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage. The sector is regulated
by the [ Commission for Regulation of Utilities (CRU) ](https://www.cru.ie/) .

Irish Water is currently implementing a 7-year business plan entitled [
Transforming Water Services in Ireland to 2021 (pdf)
](https://www.water.ie/docs/Irish-Water-Business-Plan.pdf) . The plan has been
brought into effect under the [ Water Services Act 2013
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2013/en/act/pub/0006/index.html) and the [
Water Services (No. 2) Act 2013
](http://www.oireachtas.ie/viewdoc.asp?DocID=24954&&CatID=59) . Further
information is available on [ water.ie ](http://water.ie/) , and from the [
Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage
](https://www.gov.ie/en/policy-
information/ace5b-water/?referrer=http://www.housing.gov.ie/water/water-
quality/water) .

**Ensuring water quality**

For further information on how the quality of both public and private water
supplies is ensured, see [ our document on water quality ](/en/housing/water-
and-coasts/water-quality/) . You can also get information on the [ Household
Water Conservation Charge ](/en/housing/water-and-coasts/water-charges/) .

##  Types of water supply

###  Public water schemes

Public water mains are administered and maintained by Irish Water, however
local authorities provide certain services on behalf of Irish Water through
service level agreements.

The Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage funds the provision
and upgrading of capital projects in water and wastewater services. Irish
Water administer the actual building of public water supply projects.
Stringent water testing is carried out on all public waters by local
authorities and the results are provided to the Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA) each year.

**Irish water plebiscite on ownership**

Section 2 of the Water Services Act 2014 provides that, before a Bill can be
proposed for the sale of any share in Irish Water to anyone other than a
Government Minister, a number of steps must be taken:

  * A resolution must be passed by each House of the Oireachtas (the Dáil and the Seanad) approving such a proposal 
  * A proposal to allow for such a sale must be submitted to a plebiscite and 
  * The proposal must be approved in the plebiscite 

Anyone with a right to vote in a referendum would have the right to vote in
this plebiscite.

###  Group water schemes

Many households that are not connected to a public water supply are served by
group water schemes. These schemes are formed by two or more households coming
together to provide their own common water supply. The group elects trustees
to act on behalf of its members in all dealings with the local authority.

Usually, group schemes are established in areas where the local authority does
not intend to install a water supply system in the near future, or at all.
Group water schemes can get water supplies from the public mains, if possible,
or from private sources like wells or lakes.

You have to pay for your water if you belong to a private group water scheme.
However, local authorities do provide subsidies for each house in a group
scheme – see 'Grants for wells and group water schemes' below. Local
authorities have the remit to test the water supply and ensure it is safe to
drink but they are not responsible for maintaining group scheme pipes and
filtration systems.

If the members of a group water scheme want the local authority to take over
the running of the scheme, they must sign a waiver to allow local authority
personnel on their land to maintain pipes, etc. The group must give the local
authority a map of the pipe system and give it access to test pipes for
leakage. If the local authority takes over the scheme, it is then responsible
for maintaining the water system. However, if a group water scheme remains
fully private, it may get technical and grant assistance from the local
authority for any necessary upgrading works.

The [ National Federation of Group Water Schemes ](http://www.nfgws.ie/Home)
is a co-operative society, established to represent the interests of members
of group water schemes. It also provides advisory, training, developmental and
other services to scheme members.

###  Private water supplies (groundwater)

If you are not part of a water supply scheme (public or group), you will have
to consider boring your own well and drawing out groundwater to supply your
needs. The Institute of Geologists of Ireland (IGI) has prepared [ guidelines
for drilling private wells ](http://igi.ie/publications/guidelines/) .

When the well is drilled, you should seal it against pollution, make sure it
is disinfected and get a sample tested. See the IGI’s [ guidelines on Water
well construction (pdf) ](http://www.igi.ie/assets/files/Water Well
Guidelines/Guidelines.pdf) for further details. If your water supply has been
polluted by negligence, you should contact your local authority. It can
prosecute those responsible under the [ Local Government (Water Pollution Act)
1977 ](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1977/en/act/pub/0001/index.html) .

##  Water conservation

The Water Services Act 2007 provides for the conservation of water where
leakage occurs due to unrepaired pipes or equipment, or where poor management
results in wastage or excessive consumption of water. Irish water are
currently operating a [ Leakage Reduction Programme
](https://www.water.ie/projects-plans/national-projects/leakage-reduction-
programme/) to improve the pipe network across the country.

[ Regulations made under the Water Services Act (pdf)
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2017/act/29/enacted/en/print.html) also
apply to water restrictions in times of water shortages. Irish Water can make
an order to stop or restrict the use of water supplies for:

  * Watering gardens, recreational parks or sports grounds 
  * Washing cars and trailers (including by commercial car wash facilities) 
  * Filling or replenishing swimming pools, ponds and lakes 
  * Irrigating or spraying crops. 

It is an offence not to comply with a water conservation order.

##  Grants for wells and group water schemes

###  Grants for a private water supply

Under the Rural Water programme, there are [ grants available
](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/1d9d8-private-wells/) to improve people’s
private water supply in rural areas where they cannot access the public water
supply. A private water supply provides water to one house and is often, a
well.

To qualify for a grant, your house must be more than 7 years old and not
connected to a public or group scheme. You can get a grant to:

**Fix a private water supply**

This grant covers 85% of the approved costs of rehabilitation works to your
well, up to a maximum of €3,000.

**Install a new well**

This grant covers 85% of the approved costs of a new well, up to a maximum of
€5,000. Your local authority must agree that a new well is the most
appropriate solution.

****

**Improve the water quality**

This grant covers 100% of the approved costs of improving water quality in
your well, up to a maximum of €1,000. The work may include filtration or Ultra
Violet treatment.

The minimum grant you can get is €750.

To apply for a grant, you should complete an [ application form
](https://assets.gov.ie/111092/8ed6cbaa-f489-4c90-aedc-4e445d597f4a.pdf) (pdf)
and send it to the rural water section of your local authority.

For further information see the [ Department’s terms and conditions for the
grants
](https://assets.gov.ie/111092/8ed6cbaa-f489-4c90-aedc-4e445d597f4a.pdf) .

###  Grants for group water schemes

Grants are available from the local authority if 2 or more householders get
together to provide their homes and farms with a water system where none
exists. A committee that represents the scheme members must propose the scheme
and the local authority must approve it. The amount of grant payable depends
on where the scheme is located. Check with your local authority for details of
your area. Generally, a grant will cover 85% of the cost, with a limit of
€7,650 for each house in the scheme. The group members must cover the balance,
but costs can be kept down if members can do some of the work themselves.

An annual subsidy is available for the running costs of the group water
scheme. This must be approved by the local authority. The subsidy is:

  * Up to €115 for each house supplied from a from a public source (Irish Water) 
  * Up to €231 for each house supplied from a private source (such as a private well, lake or borehole) 
  * The cost per house where water disinfection and treatment is provided under a Design Build Operate (DBO) contract 
  * Up to €100 per house for schemes of less than 100 houses, that agree to work towards an amalgamation or strategy that results in them forming a new entity 

##  How to apply

You can find grant forms and water supply information on [ your local
authority website ](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/942f74-local-
