Payment (WFP)

#  Case study 1: Working Family Payment (WFP)

###  This is an example showing how income is assessed for Working Family
Payment (2024 rates) when parenting alone.

###  Case study

Mary has 3 children. Her youngest 2 children are 5 and 7 years old. She is
getting a [ One-Parent Family Payment (OFP) ](/en/social-welfare/families-and-
children/one-parent-family-payment/) and was recently offered work part-time.

If she takes the job, she will work 3 days each week and earn €300. Mary wants
to take the job as all her children are now in school, but she knows her One-
Parent Family Payment will be affected.

Would Mary be better off financially if she takes the job offer?

She has lived in her home for 20 years and has a small mortgage. She gets a
weekly maintenance payment of €80 for her mortgage costs, which does not
affect her One-Parent Family Payment. Her 18-year-old daughter is a student
and has a part-time job in a local shop.

###  Working Family Payment rate calculation

####  Step 1: Find Mary’s weekly income

Mary’s weekly net income from employment ( **note 1** ): €300

**Add** weekly net income from self-employment: €0

**Add** reduced OFP (note 2): €318

**Add** income from occupational pensions: €0

**Add** maintenance received: €80

Total income: €698

####  Step 2: Calculate the WFP rate

To get the [ Working Family Payment (WFP) ](/en/social-welfare/families-and-
children/working-family-payment/) , Mary’s average weekly income must be under
a certain amount for her family size. The maximum income limit for a family
with 3 children is €847.

The WFP payment she can get is 60% of the difference between her average
weekly family income, and the WFP income limit for her family size.

  * The difference between €847 and €698 is €149 
  * 60% of €149 is €89.40 

So, Mary will get a WFP rate of €89.40 each week.

####  If Mary takes the job and gets WFP

Mary’s current weekly income is €458 (€378 One-parent Family Payment for
herself and 3 children, plus €80 maintenance).

If she takes the job, her total gross income including WFP will be **€787.40**
(€318 reduced OFP + €89.40 WFP + €300 income from work + €80 from
maintenance).

###  Note 1

Mary’s net income from employment is assessed for WFP. However, her daughter’s
income is **not assessed** because she is under 22 years of age and in full-
time education.

###  Note 2

If Mary gets €300 from employment, her One-Parent Family Payment will be
reduced.

  * The first €165 of Mary’s income from employment is disregarded (not included) in the means test for OFP (€300 - €165 = €135) 
  * The Department will assess 50% of the remaining €135, which is €67.50, as Mary’s means 

A person with means of €67.50 gets an OFP payment of €172. Mary also gets €46
for each child under 12, and €54 for her child that is 12 and over.

So, her total weekly OFP payment will be €318 (€172 + €46 + €46 + €54 = €318).
