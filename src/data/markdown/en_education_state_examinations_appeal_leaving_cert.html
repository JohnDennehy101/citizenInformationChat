##  Can I appeal my Leaving Certificate results?

You can appeal your [ Leaving Certificate ](/en/education/state-
examinations/leaving-certificate/) results.

If you are not satisfied with the marks you get in one or more subjects of the
Leaving Certificate examination, you can appeal those results to the [ State
Examinations Commission (SEC)
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/education/state-examinations/the-
state-examinations-commission/) .

If you appeal your mark in a written exam, your script will be sent to an
appeal examiner for re-marking.

##  Applying to see your exam script

**Applications to view Leaving Certificate 2024 exam scripts closed on 28
August 2024.**

After you get your exam results, you can apply to view your examination
script. This allows you to see how your work was marked so you can make an
appeal if you think there was a mistake. There is no fee to view your exam
scripts.

Leaving Certificate 2024 candidates applied to see exam scripts on the
Candidate Self-Service Portal. Leaving Certificate Applied candidates applied
by email to [ viewlcascript@examinations.ie
](mailto:viewlcascript@examinations.ie) .

###  **When can I view my exam script?**

If you applied to view your script and it was marked manually, you were
invited to a 3-hour viewing session in your school on 31 August 2024.

If your script was marked online, you received access to view your script
online for 24 hours between 9am on 31 August 2024 and 9am on 1 September 2024.

###  Rectification outside of the appeal process

If you have viewed your script and believe there is a clear discrepancy
between the mark awarded and the subsequent grade awarded, you also have means
of redress. You should ask the Organising Superintendent at the viewing
session for a _Rectification Outside of the Appeal Process Form_ .

This rectification service applies **only** where it is clear that the total
mark is inconsistent with the grade awarded and where this matter can be
resolved administratively.

Read more about [ appealing your results and rectification outside of the
appeal process on the SEC's website
](http://www.examinations.ie/index.php?l=en&mc=ca&sc=ga) .

##  How the Leaving Certificate appeal process works

Your script will be sent to an appeal examiner for re-marking. This will not
be the same person who originally marked your work. The same marking scheme is
used for re-marking. This means that appeal examiners apply the same standards
in re-marking as were applied to all candidates in the original examination.

For Leaving Certificate 2024, a post-marking adjustment was made to all
results. These are additional marks awarded to a candidate's component
results. Post-marking adjustments cannot be appealed. However, the post-
adjustment changes if your overall mark changes following the appeal.

Read more about the [ appeal process on the SEC’s website
](https://www.examinations.ie/index.php?l=en&mc=ca&sc=gl) .

If you are not happy with the outcome of your appeal, you can view the appeals
exam script and then you may request an [ appeal review by the Independent
Appeals Scrutineers ](https://www.examinations.ie/index.php?l=en&mc=ca&sc=gu)
(see ‘Leaving Certificate 2024 appeal results’ below).

##  How to apply to appeal your results

Applications to appeal your Leaving Certificate 2024 results closed on 2
September 2024. Applications were made through the [ Candidate Self-Service
Portal ](https://www.examinations.ie/cssp/2024/) .
