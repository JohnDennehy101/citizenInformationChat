Jobseeker's Benefit (Self-Employed)

#  Jobseeker's Benefit (Self-Employed)

  * Introduction 
  * Rules for Jobseeker's Benefit (Self-Employed) 
  * Rate of Jobseeker’s Benefit (Self-Employed) 
  * How to apply for Jobseeker's Benefit (Self-Employed) 
  * Where to apply 

##  Introduction

Jobseeker’s Benefit (Self-Employed) (JBSE) is a weekly payment from the
Department of Social Protection (DSP) to people who lose their self-
employment.

If you don't qualify for Jobseeker's Benefit (Self-Employed) you may qualify
for [ Jobseeker's Allowance ](/en/social-welfare/unemployed-people/jobseekers-
allowance/) .

##  Rules for Jobseeker's Benefit (Self-Employed)

To qualify for Jobseeker's Benefit (Self-Employed) you must:

  * Be aged between 18 and pension age 
  * No longer be self-employed. You must have lost your self-employment involuntarily and not because of a temporary shutdown or seasonal closure. 
  * Be unemployed (you can work as an employee for up to 3 days each week) 
  * Be capable of work 
  * Be available for and genuinely seeking full-time work 
  * Have enough social insurance (PRSI) contributions 

**Pension age**

Pension age is 66, but if you [ defer getting your State Pension
(Contributory) ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/social-
welfare-payments/older-and-retired-people/deferring-your-state-pension-
contributory/) to after age 66, you may qualify for Jobseeker's Benefit (Self-
Employed) during this period. If you're 66 or over, apply for Jobseeker's
Benefit (Self-Employed) using a paper form from your local Intreo Center or
Social Welfare Branch Office. You will not get credited PRSI contributions
while getting Jobseeker’s Benefit at age 66 or over.

You can read more about [ the conditions for getting a jobseeker's payment
](/en/social-welfare/unemployed-people/rules-for-getting-a-jobseekers-
payment/) and about the [ employment services that the DSP offers to
jobseekers ](/en/social-welfare/unemployed-people/employment-supports/) .

####

###  Social insurance (PRSI) contributions

To qualify for Jobseeker's Benefit (Self-Employed), you must pay Class S PRSI.
Class S is the one paid by self-employed people. Class A or H PRSI
contributions can also help you to qualify.

To qualify for Jobseeker’s Benefit (Self-Employed) you need:

  * At least 156 weeks of Class S contributions **or** at least 104 weeks of paid Class A or H PRSI since first starting work 
  * 52 weeks of Class S contributions paid in the relevant tax year. The relevant tax year is the second-last complete tax year before the year in which your claim is made. So, for claims made in 2024, the relevant tax year is 2022. 

###  Jobseeker's Benefit (Self-Employed) and work

To get Jobseeker's Benefit (Self-Employed) you must stop all self-employment
activity. However, you can work as an employee for up to 3 days each week and
get Jobseeker's Benefit (Self-Employed).

If you are working for part of a week, your payment will be based on a 5-day
payment week. This means that for each day that you are employed, 1/5th of the
normal rate of Jobseeker's Benefit (Self-Employed) is deducted. For example,
if you get part-time work for 2 days, you will get 3/5ths of the normal rate
for that week and you get part-time work for 3 days, you will get 2/5ths of
the normal rate for the week. You must still be unemployed for at least 4 days
out of 7 to claim Jobseeker's Benefit (Self-Employed). You can read [ FAQS
about the 5-day working week on welfare.ie
](http://www.welfare.ie/en/downloads/faq_jb_5daychanges.pdf) .

There is an exemption from some of the rules for retained firefighters. More
information is available about [ work and Jobseeker’s Benefit ](/en/social-
welfare/social-welfare-payments-and-work/jobseekers-benefit-and-work/) .

###  How long can I get paid Jobseeker's Benefit (Self-Employed)?

Jobseeker's Benefit (Self-Employed) is paid for 9 months (39 weeks) for people
with 260 or more Class S PRSI contributions. It is paid for 6 months (26
weeks) for people with fewer than 260 Class S PRSI contributions.

[ There are some special provisions for older jobseekers. ](/en/social-
welfare/unemployed-people/older-jobseekers/) People over 65 who are claiming
Jobseeker’s Benefit (Self-Employed) may **continue to be paid until their 66th
birthday** even if their claim is due to end before that date.

**For JB (Self-Employed)** **Number of contributions** |  **Duration of claim**  
---|---  
260 or more  |  39 weeks (9 months)   
Less than 260  |  26 weeks (6 months)   
  
###  Re-qualifying for Jobseeker's Benefit (Self-Employed)

You can re-qualify for Jobseeker’s Benefit (Self-Employed) if you:

  * Have used up your full Jobseeker’s Benefit (Self-Employed) entitlement (either 9 or 6 months) 
  * Have not claimed Jobseeker’s Benefit (Self-Employed) for at least 12 months 
  * Have at least 52 weeks of Class S contributions paid since your Jobseeker’s Benefit (Self-Employed) claim ended. 

###  Linking claims

If you claim Jobseeker’s Benefit (Self-Employed) for a period, sign off and
then claim it again within 26 weeks, your claim may be linked to the earlier
claim. This means that your claim is not treated as a new claim and:

  * The cumulative total of days from the previous claim is continued (so, for example, if you have used up 100 days of your total entitlement of 234 days you have 134 days remaining on your claim) 
  * The rate is the same rate payable as on the previous claim, unless there has been a budgetary increase or change in family circumstances (such as a new child dependant). 

###  Disqualification

You may be disqualified from getting Jobseeker's Benefit (Self-Employed) for 9
weeks if you have received moneys from the sale or disposal of your business
in excess of an amount set by the DSP.

###  Students

To get Jobseeker's Benefit (Self-Employed) you must be at least 18 years of
age and you must have been out of school for 3 months.

Third-level students cannot claim Jobseeker's Benefit (Self-Employed) while
they are studying full-time. This disqualification also applies to the summer
holiday periods between academic years.

##  Rate of Jobseeker’s Benefit (Self-Employed)

**Weekly** **Jobseeker’s Benefit (Self-Employed) rate 2024**

**Average weekly earnings** |  **Personal rate** |  **Increase for an adult dependant** |  **Increase for a qualified child**  
---|---|---|---  
€300 or more  |  €232  |  €154  |  €46 for a child aged under 12 years  €54 for a child aged 12 years or over   
€220-€299.99  |  €181.70   
€150-€219.99  |  €149.60  |  €99.70   
Less than €150  |  €104.10   
  
You get a personal rate and may get an increase for an [ adult dependant
](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/claiming-a-social-welfare-
payment/claiming-an-increase-in-your-social-welfare-payment-for-an-adult-
dependant/) and [ child dependant ](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-
system/claiming-a-social-welfare-payment/claiming-and-increase-in-your-
payment-for-a-child-dependant/) . Your average weekly earnings do not affect
the amount you get for a child dependant.

From June 2024, if you are getting an Increase for Qualified Adult, any child
maintenance they get is no longer included in the income test. However, if
they get maintenance that is not child maintenance, this will continue to be
included in their assessed income.

**Average weekly earnings**

Jobseeker’s Benefit (Self-Employed) rates are graduated according to your
earnings in the relevant tax year. Your average weekly earnings are your gross
weekly income in the relevant tax year divided by the number of Class S
contributions paid in that year.

The relevant tax year is the second-last complete tax year before the year in
which your claim is made. For example, if you claim Jobseeker's Benefit in
2024 the relevant tax year is 2022. If you only qualify for a reduced payment,
it may be of greater benefit for you to claim [ Jobseeker's Allowance
](/en/social-welfare/unemployed-people/jobseekers-allowance/) instead of
Jobseeker's Benefit (Self-Employed).

If you had no earnings but got PUP in 2021, you will meet the average weekly
earnings requirement for a claim where 2021 is your relevant tax year, and get
the maximum rate of Jobseeker’s Benefit. However, if you had earnings in 2021,
your average weekly earnings will be calculated by dividing your gross yearly
earnings by the number of paid contributions.

####  Penalty rates

Your payment can be reduced if you refuse or fail to attend meetings requested
by the DSP or if you refuse or fail to participate in an appropriate
employment support scheme, work experience or training. You can find out about
[ sanctions for not meeting the conditions of your jobseeker's payment.
](/en/social-welfare/unemployed-people/rules-for-getting-a-jobseekers-
payment/)

###  Getting paid

Jobseeker’s Benefit (Self-Employed) is paid directly each week into your bank
