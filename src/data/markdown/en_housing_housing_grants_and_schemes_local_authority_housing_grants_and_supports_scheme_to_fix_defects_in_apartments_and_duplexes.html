  * How will the planned scheme work?

##  What is the planned scheme to fund fixing defects in apartments and
duplexes?

Many apartments and duplexes built between 1991 and 2013 have serious defects.
These include defects with fire safety, structural safety and water getting
into the property.

A [ new scheme will provide funding to fix these defects
](https://www.gov.ie/en/press-release/b6817-government-approves-establishment-
of-defects-scheme-for-apartments-and-duplexes/) . Fixing these defects is
known as ‘remediation work’.

The Government is preparing legislation to bring the scheme into effect and it
is intended that it will start in 2024.

In the meantime, an Interim Remediation Scheme has been launched.

##  Interim scheme to fix fire safety issues

On 11 December 2023, [ an Interim Remediation Scheme was launched
](https://www.gov.ie/en/press-release/d252a-government-launches-the-interim-
remediation-scheme-for-fire-safety-defects-in-apartments-and-duplexes/) . The
interim scheme funds work to fix emergency fire safety issues in apartments
and duplexes that were built between 1991 and 2013. It aims to ensure that
there is an acceptable standard of fire safety in buildings before more
comprehensive works are completed under the main scheme.

The Interim Remediation Scheme is administered by the Housing Agency. Your [
owners' management company
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/housing/owning-a-home/home-
owners/management-companies-for-apartment-blocks/#63e738) applies to the
Housing Agency for funding by completing the online [ application form
](https://survey.zohopublic.eu/zs/tTBj2w) . If the application qualifies for
the interim scheme, the Housing Agency will email information to the OMC
outlining the next steps. This should happen within 7 to 10 working days of
the application. The Housing Agency has [ more information about the interim
scheme including details of what work is covered by the scheme
](https://www.housingagency.ie/interim-remediation-scheme-fire-safety-defects-
eligible-apartments-and-duplexes-2023) .

##  How will the planned scheme work?

The Government has developed a proposal for the planned scheme.

In the proposal, the Housing Agency will administer the scheme and provide
information and advice to [ owners' management companies (OMCs)
](/en/housing/owning-a-home/home-owners/management-companies-for-apartment-
blocks/) and homeowners about it.

###  **Who will get the funding under the planned scheme?**

Owners’ management companies (OMCs) will receive funding to carry out the
remediation work (repair work). The whole building will be considered at the
same time for remediation work. This means common areas and individual
apartments will be assessed together. The amount of funding provided will
depend on the defects to be fixed.

###  What properties will qualify for the planned scheme?

Apartments and duplexes built between 1991 and 2013 will qualify for the
scheme. The scheme will cover work to fix:

  * Fire safety defects 
  * Structural safety defects 
  * Defects caused by water getting into a property 

The scheme only applies if the defects were caused by defective design,
workmanship or materials that breached the [ Building Regulations
](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/1d2af-building-regulations/) which applied
when the property was built.

The scheme will not cover defects that came about because:

  * The building was not adequately maintained 
  * Sinking funds did not plan funding to replace building and safety systems when they expired 
  * Later building work was not managed correctly and this led to defects 

##  What if I am beginning work on my property or have already fixed issues?

###  Work to fix fire safety defects

On 11 December 2023, the [ Interim Remediation Scheme
](https://www.gov.ie/en/service/ede52-interim-remediation-scheme-for-fire-
safety-defects-in-apartments-and-duplexes/) was launched to fix emergency fire
safety issues. Your owner’s management company applies for funding to fix fire
safety defects under this scheme.

Before the interim scheme was launched it was agreed that remediation work
that began after 17 January 2023 to fix fire safety defects in these
apartments and duplexes would be included in the main scheme. This applies as
long as the work meets certain conditions and you agree on the remedial work
with the local authority fire services in advance.

This is being done to ensure that fire safety fixes are not postponed while
waiting for the scheme to begin.

###  Other work already begun or completed

A legacy defects scheme is planned to cover the cost of remediation work that
has already been completed. The detail of this scheme is not available yet.

##  Who do I contact about defects in my apartment or duplex?

You should contact the [ owners management company (OMC) for your apartment or
duplex ](/en/housing/owning-a-home/home-owners/management-companies-for-
apartment-blocks/) , if you think your property has a defect. The OMC should
get someone to inspect the issue so it can be fixed.

If it is an emergency fire safety issue, the OMC can apply for funding to get
it fixed under the Interim Remediation Scheme. Then, when the main scheme is
operational, the OMC will get funding through the scheme to do all the other
necessary remediation works to your building. The [ Housing Agency
](https://www.housingagency.ie/) will also provide information and advice
about the planned scheme once it begins.

##  Further information and contacts

The Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage has developed an [
FAQ about the proposed scheme
](https://www.gov.ie/pdf/?file=https://assets.gov.ie/245015/d957ef5e-3bfc-4e08-8af5-2e4b29301569.pdf#page=null)
. The Housing Agency also has [ information about the proposed scheme on their
website ](https://www.housingagency.ie/remediation-defects-apartments-and-
duplexes) .
