##  Postal service providers

###  Postal service providers

Anyone can set up a postal business once they [ notify ComReg
](https://www.comreg.ie/industry/postal-regulation/authorised-postal-
providers/get-an-authorisation/) .

A postal service involves clearance, sorting, transport, and distribution.
Document exchange, courier services and unaddressed advertising are not
considered to be postal services.

When completing the notification form, you must decide whether your postal
service is within the scope of the universal postal service.

ComReg has a [ register of authorised providers
](https://www.comreg.ie/industry/postal-regulation/authorised-postal-
providers/authorised-postal-providers-register/) and [ more information on the
regulation of authorised providers ](http://www.comreg.ie/industry/postal-
regulation/authorised-postal-providers/authorised-postal-providers-register/)

##  Parcels from abroad

VAT and any duties apply to parcels from outside the European Union (EU). You
must pay before the parcel is delivered to you.

Customs duty and VAT may apply to [ purchases from the UK
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/consumer/shopping/buying-online-from-
uk-after-brexit/) (not Northern Ireland).

VAT and customs duties collection varies among delivery providers. They
either:

  * Pay the fee for you and then charge you directly 
  * Tell you the relevant charge and asks you to pay them before delivering the package 
  * Lets you deal directly with Revenue 

The amount charged for clearing items through customs can vary across
providers. Usually, these charges are based on a percentage of the value of
the items.

residential and business addresses. Use the [ Eircode Finder
