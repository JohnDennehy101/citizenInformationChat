##  Introduction

In Ireland, [ An Post ](http://www.anpost.ie/AnPost/) provides the national
post service and is regulated by the [ Commission for Communications
Regulation (ComReg) ](http://www.comreg.ie/) .

ComReg ensures affordability, quality standards, and a basic level of service.

###  Stamp increases in 2024

From 1 February 2024, the standard national letter [ stamp will increase
](https://www.anpost.com/Media-Centre/News/Postage-rates-to-increase-next-
month,-by-less-than) from €1.35 to €1.40.

The standard international letter stamp and the Digital Stamp will stay the
same.

Find more [ postal rates ](https://www.anpost.com/Post-Parcels/Sending/Postal-
Rates) on the An Post website. You can keep up to date with any customer
notices on [ anpost.com ](https://www.anpost.com/Media-Centre/News) or An
Post’s social media channels.

##  Postal service providers

###  Postal service providers

Anyone can set up a postal business once they [ notify ComReg
](https://www.comreg.ie/industry/postal-regulation/authorised-postal-
providers/get-an-authorisation/) .

A postal service involves clearance, sorting, transport, and distribution.
Document exchange, courier services and unaddressed advertising are not
considered to be postal services.

When completing the notification form, you must decide whether your postal
service is within the scope of the universal postal service.

ComReg has a [ register of authorised providers
](https://www.comreg.ie/industry/postal-regulation/authorised-postal-
providers/authorised-postal-providers-register/) and [ more information on the
regulation of authorised providers ](http://www.comreg.ie/industry/postal-
regulation/authorised-postal-providers/authorised-postal-providers-register/)
.

###  Universal service provider

As the universal service provider, An Post must provide:

  * Daily collection and delivery of letters, packets and parcels (Monday to Friday) 
  * Free certificates of posting, registered items service, insured items service 
  * Free postal services for blind or partially sighted people 
  * Specialist facilities such as redirection, business reply and freepost 

Full details of the postal services that An Post must provide nationally and
internationally are set out in the [ Communications Regulation (Universal
Postal Service) Regulations 2012 (SI 280 of 2012)
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2012/en/si/0280.html) .

###  An Post’s other services

[ An Post ](http://www.anpost.ie/AnPost/) also provides:

  * Postal services not under the universal service requirement 
  * Non-postal services such as Express Post, Post Passport, Philatelic Services (dealing with stamps), Courier Post and other financial services 
  * [ Supports for communities ](https://www.anpost.com/Community/Supporting-the-vulnerable-in-our-communities) such as check-ins for older or vulnerable customers in their homes 
  * [ Newspaper-ordering and delivery service ](https://www.anpost.com/Post-Parcels/Receiving/Newspaper-deliveries)
  * Arrangements for people who cannot collect their social welfare payments at the post office – you can [ nominate a temporary agent (pdf) ](https://eur03.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fcitizensinformationboard.newsweaver.com%2F6xhzlt1oik%2Fnw1zpsjdlks10jpekytias%2Fexternal%3Femail%3Dtrue%26a%3D5%26p%3D4210453%26t%3D2911414&data=02%7C01%7CAisling.Kennedy%40ciboard.ie%7Ca8a95fa10266403dec1808d7c6afc525%7Cbb4e61ce39a3414abb5d6a0290c95fd9%7C1%7C0%7C637196330554724437&sdata=mvpB8irmlrl%2FwQlGBOwL91naeMtwJW35TZPb78oTsos%3D&reserved=0) to collect your payment 

##  Parcels from abroad

VAT and any duties apply to parcels from outside the European Union (EU). You
must pay before the parcel is delivered to you.

Customs duty and VAT may apply to [ purchases from the UK
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/consumer/shopping/buying-online-from-
uk-after-brexit/) (not Northern Ireland).

VAT and customs duties collection varies among delivery providers. They
either:

  * Pay the fee for you and then charge you directly 
  * Tell you the relevant charge and asks you to pay them before delivering the package 
  * Lets you deal directly with Revenue 

The amount charged for clearing items through customs can vary across
providers. Usually, these charges are based on a percentage of the value of
the items.

##  Postcodes

Eircode is the national postcode system with a unique 7-character code for all
residential and business addresses. Use the [ Eircode Finder
](https://finder.eircode.ie/#/) to locate or verify and Eircode.

##  Delivery issues

###  Delayed post

Standard post should be delivered within 5 working days or 15 days for
international post.

Reasons for delay include incomplete addresses, posting after collection day,
customs issues or posting prohibited (banned) items.

###  Missed deliveries

If you miss a delivery An Post will leave a ‘sorry we missed you’ notice. You
have the following options:

  * Collect at your local delivery service unit (bring the notice and identification) 
  * Nominate someone else to collect on your behalf 
  * Arrange [ redelivery online ](https://managingmail.anpost.ie/redelivery/?_ga=2.88209183.523548562.1578768588-1896364129.1578768588&_gac=1.55757145.1578829526.CjwKCAiApOvwBRBUEiwAcZGdGO74tBTp9fDQDTlkrAYWlUP1DJT-iviZA3YM_I0qRZHbYCQRU2eSxhoCrBMQAvD_BwE)

An Post will only keep items for 5 working days (standard post), 3 working
days (registered post) and 16 working days (items from abroad).

If the item has not been collected it will be returned to the sender (if their
address is on the outside).
