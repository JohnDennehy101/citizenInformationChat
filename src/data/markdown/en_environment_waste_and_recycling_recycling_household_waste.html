##  Introduction

You can lower your [ waste collection charges ](/en/environment/waste-and-
recycling/domestic-refuse/) and reduce the amount of waste going to [ landfill
sites ](/en/environment/waste-and-recycling/landfill-sites/) by recycling and
composting your waste. Many of the items you use at home can be recycled and
there are a range of services and facilities where you can recycle your
household waste.

##  Where can I recycle my waste?

There are different ways to recycle waste. You can take waste that can be
recycled to a recycling facility, use your recycling bin or use a kerbside
collection (when available).

For organic waste, you can use your brown bin or compost it yourself. Many
recycling facilities also accept bulky organic waste such as garden waste.

There are 4 types of permanent recycling facility:

  * Bring banks 
  * Civic amenity sites 
  * Recycling centres 
  * Deposit Return Scheme for bottle and can recycling 

###  **Bring banks**

Bring banks are unstaffed collection points for recyclable materials like:

  * Glass bottles 
  * Drinks cans 
  * Food cans 

Some bring banks also have collection bins for unwanted clothes.

You can use [ mywaste’s service location ](https://www.mywaste.ie/waste-
service-locator/) to find your nearest bring bank.

###  **Civic amenity sites**

Civic amenity sites can accept a larger variety of items than bring banks. The
sites are purpose-built and have staff and specific opening hours. In general,
they accept:

  * Paper 
  * Cardboard 
  * Plastic and glass bottles 
  * Drinks cans and food tins 
  * Textiles and footwear 
  * Electrical equipment 
  * Fluorescent tubes 
  * Waste oil 
  * DIY waste 

Some civic amenity sites also accept garden waste and Christmas trees.

You can also get recycling advice and information from the staff at civic
amenity sites and they may sell home composting bins.

You can use [ mywaste’s service location ](https://www.mywaste.ie/waste-
service-locator/) to find your nearest civic amenity site.

###  **Recycling centres**

Recycling centres are also staffed and have specific opening hours but accept
a smaller variety of items than civic amenity sites. In general, they do not
accept very bulky items. They are not custom-built and tend to be located on
existing sites such as local authority depots.

You can get recycling advice and information from staff at your local
recycling centre and they may also sell home composting bins.

Find your nearest recycling centre, it’s opening hours, contact details [ on
this map ](https://www.mywaste.ie/waste-service-locator/) .

###  Deposit Return Scheme for bottle and can recycling

The [ Deposit Return Scheme ](/en/environment/waste-and-recycling/deposit-
return-scheme/) started on 1 February 2024 and changed how certain drinks
containers are recycled.

The cost of the deposit is automatically added to the cost of the drink. You
can get the deposit back by returning your containers once they are empty and
undamaged.

See our page on the [ Deposit Return Scheme ](/en/environment/waste-and-
recycling/deposit-return-scheme/) for more information.

###  **Where to recycle your Christmas tree**

Most local authorities also set up temporary collection points for Christmas
trees each year.

And some civic amenity sites may also accept Christmas trees.

You can find out what recycling services are available in your area from [
Repak, ](https://repak.ie/recycling/recycling-centres-bring-banks/) on [
mywaste.ie ](https://www.mywaste.ie/waste-service-locator/) or from your [
local authority. ](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/942f74-local-
authorities/)

###  Recycling at home

**Green bin collection**

Kerbside bin collection of recyclable waste is often known as a ‘green bin’
collection. In certain areas, your waste company may use waste bags and tags
or communal bins. Check the table below for what items can be recycled in the
green bin.

Find [ which recycling services collect bins in your area.
](https://www.mywaste.ie/waste-management-providers/)

**Brown bin collection**

Your waste collector must offer you a brown bin collection service for food
and organic waste. This applies unless you live on an offshore island. Read
more about [ brown bin collection.
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/environment/waste-and-
recycling/composting-domestic-waste/)

You can also recycle your food waste yourself at home by composting it.
Compost is rich in plant nutrients, and you can dig it into soil to improve
your garden. Most garden and kitchen waste can be composted – see [ our page
on composting ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/environment/waste-and-
recycling/composting-domestic-waste/) for more information.

##  What can I put in my green recycling bin?

All items for recycling should be clean, dry and placed loosely in the
recycling bin.

You can put the following materials in your green recycling bin:

**Paper and cardboard** |  Letters  Envelopes  Brochures  Cardboard boxes (flattened)  Egg boxes  Potato bags  Cardboard centres from toilet roll and kitchen roll  Newspapers  'Tetra Pak' cartons for juice or milk  Pizza boxes (if part of the box is soiled, separate this and put it in your brown bin)   
---|---  
**Rigid plastic (washed and dried)** |  Plastic drink bottles  Plastic cleaning bottles  Butter, yoghurt and salad tubs  Plastic trays for fruit and vegetables  Plastic milk containers  Plastic bottles for liquid soap or shampoo   
**Soft plastic (washed and dried)** |  Frozen food bags  Bread wrappers  Plastic shopping bags  Bubble wrap  Crisp wrappers  Pasta bags  Outer wrapping on kitchen and toilet rolls  Breakfast cereal bags   
**Tins and cans (washed and dried)** |  Soup cans  Pet food cans  Certain drink cans  Food cans   
  
###  Paper coffee cups

Paper coffee cups are sometimes made of compostable material. If your paper
cup is certified as compostable, it will say this on the cup and should be
placed in your brown bin at home. Otherwise, it should be put in the general
waste bin. You should check the lid and the sleeve of the coffee cup to see if
these can be recycled.

For more details on what can and cannot go in your recycling bins, see [
mywaste.ie. ](https://www.mywaste.ie/page-what-to-do-with/)

##  What can I bring to a recycling facility?

You can bring many items to recycling facilities. But it is important to check
with your local centre, as what they accept can vary from centre to centre.

Most recycling centres accept:

  * Glass bottles and jars – You can recycle the lids and caps separately in your recycling bin at home. 
  * Paper (newspapers, magazines, office paper, junk mail, comics and light cardboard) 
  * Drinks cartons, for example, milk or juice cartons 
  * Aluminium, for example, soft drink and beer cans or foil 
  * Plastic bottles and cartons 
  * Food tins, for example tins for fruit, vegetables or pet food 
  * Plastic bottle tops, metal and aluminium lids 
  * Textiles, for example, clean clothes, bed linen, towels, coats and jackets 
  * White goods, for example, washing machines, cookers, dryers, dishwashers, fridges 
  * Batteries. You can also recycle these for free in certain shops and supermarkets as part of the [ Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) ](/en/environment/waste-and-recycling/weee/) scheme. 

**All materials should be clean** , to avoid contamination. You should always
wash out bottles, cans and yogurt pots before recycling.

###  What will not be accepted for recycling?

  * Crystal glass, Pyrex, television tubes, car windscreens and opal glass. Opal glass is   
alcohol bottles where a large amount of foil is glued to the bottle.

  * Porcelain, pottery, stones and ceramic tiles 
  * Carpets and rugs, cushions or mattresses 
  * Laminated or waxed papers like paper cups 

###  Recycling hazardous waste

Many household products contain substances that are potentially harmful to the
environment. They include:

  * Medicines 
  * Aerosols 
  * Bulbs and fluorescent tubes 
  * Polishes 
  * Adhesives 
  * Household cleaners 
  * Drain cleaners 
  * Solvents 
  * Weedkillers 
  * Fertilisers 

Some of these items can be brought to a civic amenity centre, where they can
be recycled or disposed of.

Your local pharmacy can dispose of certain items safely and properly for you,
including:

  * Pharmaceutical drugs (such as painkillers) 
  * Medical waste (such as surgical gloves) 
  * Containers for pharmaceutical drugs 

If you are disposing syringes, you should get a sharps waste container from
your local GP or hospital. The HSE have [ advise on how and where to get these
(pdf)
](https://www.hse.ie/eng/about/who/healthwellbeing/infectcont/sth/info/sharps-
patient-info.pdf) .

Some local authorities organise mobile collections, where hazardous waste can
be left at a central point. Contact your [ local authority
](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/942f74-local-authorities/) for more
information.

##  Recycling vapes and e-cigarettes

Most vapes and e-cigarettes have batteries so they should not be put in your
bin at home. Instead, you should bring them to a Blue Battery Box to be
recycled. You can find Blue Battery Boxes in:

  * Local recycling centres 
  * Newsagents 
  * Supermarkets 
  * Schools 
  * Workplaces 

You may also be able to return your vape or e-cigarette to the store where you
bought it.

This recycling service is free and is provided by [ Waste Electrical and
Electronic Equipment (WEEE) Ireland ](https://www.weeeireland.ie/) .

Disposable vapes do not need to be taken apart to be recycled. However, to
recycle rechargeable vapes or e-cigarettes, you need remove the tank where the
liquid is stored before you recycle it.

WEEE has [ more information about how to recycle vapes and e-cigarettes
](https://www.weeeireland.ie/vape-e-cigarette-device-recycling/) .

##  How much do recycling services cost?

Recycling services provided to the public are mainly free of charge. However,
you may be charged to recycle certain items at civic amenity centres or
recycling centres. You can check the charges with your local centre.

If you are recycling at home you may have to pay a fee for recycling bin
collection. You can check the charges with your bin collection company.
