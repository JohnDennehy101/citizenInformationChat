Recognition of professional qualifications in Ireland

#  Recognition of professional qualifications in Ireland

  * Introduction 
  * How are professional qualifications regulated within the EU? 
  * Can I use my UK professional qualifications in Ireland after Brexit? 
  * European Professional Card (EPC) 
  * How are professional qualifications regulated in Ireland? 
  * Further information 

##  Introduction

Professional qualifications are qualification requirements that a person must
have to work in a regulated profession.

You can check if your profession is regulated in Ireland (and in other EU
member states, EEA countries and Switzerland) on the [ European Commission’s
regulated professions database ](http://ec.europa.eu/growth/tools-
databases/regprof/index.cfm) .

Some examples of regulated professions in Ireland are:

  * Electrician 
  * Teacher 
  * Architect 
  * Doctor 
  * Accountant 
  * Pharmacist 
  * Estate agent 
  * Gas installer 
  * Dental hygienist 
  * Security guard 

This page gives an overview of how professional qualifications are recognised
in Ireland and Europe. For information on academic qualifications, you can
read [ getting your foreign qualifications recognised in Ireland
](/en/returning-to-ireland/education-and-schooling/getting-your-foreign-
qualification-recognised-in-ireland/) .

**Coming from Ukraine**

If you are coming to Ireland from Ukraine, Quality and Qualifications Ireland
has information (in Ukrainian) about its [ academic qualifications recognition
service (pdf) ](https://www.qqi.ie/sites/default/files/2022-03/naric-guide-
ukraine.pdf) . This guide helps you to use QQI’s foreign qualifications
recognition service (NARIC).

If you qualified as a teacher in Ukraine and have been granted [ EU Temporary
Protection ](/en/moving-country/asylum-seekers-and-refugees/the-asylum-
process-in-ireland/temporary-protection-directive/) , you can apply to work as
a teacher in Ireland under The Teaching Council’s tailored [ registration
process for teachers from Ukraine
](https://www.teachingcouncil.ie/register/qualified-outside-of-
ireland/registration-process-for-qualified-ukrainian-teachers/) .

##  How are professional qualifications regulated within the EU?

Each EU member state sets its own national system of education and training,
which leads to its own professional qualifications.

The EU has [ systems for recognising diplomas and training
](http://europa.eu/youreurope/citizens/work/professional-
qualifications/index_en.htm) that enable you to make full use of your training
and skills in another EU country. The basic principle is that if you are
qualified to work in a profession in your home country, you are qualified to
work in the same profession in any other EU country.

However, if the profession is regulated in the country where you wish to work,
you will need to register with the regulator for that country before you can
start work. The bodies which regulate professions may also be called competent
authorities. See ‘How are professional qualifications regulated in Ireland?’
below.

If your profession is not regulated in the country where you wish to work, you
do not need to have your qualification recognised.

###  What professions are automatically recognised in Ireland?

Some professions are automatically recognised in the EU. These professions are
known as _sectoral_ professions.

Qualifications from the following professions are automatically recognised in
Ireland.

  * Architects 
  * Dentists 
  * Doctors 
  * Midwives 
  * Nurses 
  * Pharmacists 
  * Veterinary surgeons 

If you are looking for work in one of the above seven professions, you still
need to register with the relevant [ professional body to practise in Ireland
](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/d7527-professional-qualifications-
recognition/#contacts) . You can find out more in the [ European Commission’s
FAQs on regulated professions
](https://europa.eu/youreurope/citizens/work/professional-
qualifications/regulated-professions/faq/index_en.htm) .

See the European Commission website for [ information on the automatic
recognition of qualifications ](https://ec.europa.eu/growth/single-
market/services/free-movement-professionals/qualifications-
recognition/automatic_en) .

##  Can I use my UK professional qualifications in Ireland after Brexit?

Since 1 January 2021, [ mutual recognition of professional qualifications
](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/ee9f4-further-and-higher-education-and-
brexit/#professional-qualifications) (MRPQ) between the EU (including Ireland)
and the UK no longer applies.

If you are an Irish citizen who got your professional qualification in the UK,
you now need to get that qualification recognised in Ireland or in any other
EU member state where you intend to work. UK nationals must also do this.

Qualifications from the UK were automatically recognised in Ireland during the
[ transition period ](/en/government-in-ireland/ireland-and-the-uk/what-is-
brexit#lfcaf2) (from 1 February to 31 December 2020). If your qualification
was recognised during this time, you don’t have to do anything and can
continue to practice in Ireland or the EU.

If you have a query about your UK qualification being recognised in Ireland
since Brexit, you should contact the [ regulatory body for your profession
](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/d7527-professional-qualifications-
recognition/#contacts) .

The Gov.ie website will be updated with any new information about [
professional qualifications recognition
](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/869e17-studying/) .

##  European Professional Card (EPC)

The European Professional Card (EPC) is an electronic procedure you can use to
have your EU professional qualifications recognised in another EU country. It
is not a physical card. It is electronic proof that you have passed
administrative checks.

After you get the EPC, and before you take up employment in Ireland, you must
register with the relevant [ competent authority
](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/d7527-professional-qualifications-
recognition/#contacts) .

You can use the EPC procedure if you are a:

  * Nurse responsible for general care 
  * Pharmacist 
  * Physiotherapist 
  * Mountain guide 
  * Real estate agent 

The European Commission has published an introductory [ video
](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3if_6ZHsMM) about the EPC on its [ Your
Europe information portal
](https://europa.eu/youreurope/citizens/index_en.htm) . For more detailed
information, you can also read the [ EPC User guide (pdf)
](http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/imi-
net/_docs/library/epc_user_guide_professionals_en.pdf) .

For more information on the EPC, see the Department of Further and Higher
Education, Resarch, Innovation and Science's [ FAQs
](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/d7527-professional-qualifications-
recognition/#who-can-have-their-qualifications-recognised) .

##  How are professional qualifications regulated in Ireland?

The Department of Education is responsible for coordinating the recognition of
professional qualifications in Ireland. It provides online information on [
regulated professions and relevant EU legislation
](http://www.pointofsinglecontact.ie/regulated%20professions%20in%20ireland/)
.

It also keeps a database of [ competent authorities
](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/d7527-professional-qualifications-
recognition/#contacts) . Competent authority means any regulatory or
professional body that can validate professional qualifications that you
received outside Ireland. You can see some examples of regulated professions
and contact details for those professions in the table below.

###  How do you get your foreign qualification recognised?

The first step to getting your foreign qualification recognised is to contact
the competent authority for that profession in Ireland. You must do this
whether or not your profession is automatically recognised in Ireland. You
must also do this if you have an EPC.

If you do not find your profession on this [ list of competent authorities
](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/d7527-professional-qualifications-
recognition/#contacts) , you can email [ qualifications@dfheris.gov.ie
](mailto:Qualifications@dfheris.gov.ie) .

See the table below for some examples of regulated professions in Ireland.

###  What happens after you apply?

After you apply, the competent authority has 4 months to reply. It may accept
your qualification, reject it or apply a compensation measure.

A compensation measure is where the competent authority considers that your
training is significantly different in terms of duration or content from that
in the host country. You may be asked to get additional professional
experience to complete your training, or to take a training course or an
aptitude test.
