##  Irish Association of Funeral Directors

The Irish Association of Funeral Directors (IAFD) was established in 1979 to
promote excellence in funeral directing and to foster cooperation between
members - to enable them to provide a better service to their clients. IAFD
members conduct 80% of funerals on the island of Ireland. The Association is
consulted by government, local authorities, media, interest groups and the
general public on matters relating to funerals. IAFD has an established Code
of Practice and Quality Standard which must be adhered by all of its members.

[ ABOUT US ](/about-us)

Our members follow our Code of Practice and offer only the highest level  
of quality and professionalism in funeral services to the communities  
they serve.
