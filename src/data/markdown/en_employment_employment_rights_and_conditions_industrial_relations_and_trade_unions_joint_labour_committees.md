##  What is a Joint Labour Committee?

A Joint Labour Committee (JLC) is an independent body made up of equal numbers
of employer and worker representatives. A JLC sets the employment conditions
and minimum rates of pay for employees in a certain sector, for example,
contract cleaning.

JLCs are set up by the Labour Court following an application from either:

  * The Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment 
  * A trade union 
  * Any organisation that represents the workers or the employers involved 

The chairman and substitute chairman of a JLC is appointed by the Minister for
Enterprise, Trade and Employment.

##  What does a Joint Labour Committee do?

Joint Labour Committees can draft up an [ Employment Regulation Order (ERO)
](/en/employment/employment-rights-and-conditions/industrial-relations-and-
trade-unions/employment-agreements-and-orders/) , setting out the employment
conditions and minimum rates of pay for the sector they represent. They send
the draft ERO to the Labour Court for review.

If the Labour Court agrees with the terms set out in the draft ERO, the ERO
will be sent to the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment. When the
Minister signs the ERO, it is given _statutory effect_ , which means it
becomes law.

There are currently 3 EROs in force, for the contract cleaning, security and
early learning and childcare sector.

###  The law on Joint Labour Committees

The role of a Joint Labour Committee is set out in the [ Industrial Relations
(Amendment) Act 2012
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2012/en/act/pub/0032/index.html) . This
amends the Industrial Relations Act, 1946.

Under the Act:

  * JLCs can set a basic adult wage rate and 2 additional higher rates 
  * Companies in financial difficulty can ask for an exemption from paying ERO rates 
  * When setting wage rates, JLCs must take certain factors into account, such as competitiveness and rates of employment and unemployment 
  * JLCs no longer set Sunday premium rates 

##  Current Joint Labour Committees

Joint Labour Committees (JLCs) represent workers in a particular sector.
Currently, there are Joint Labour Committees for:

  * Agricultural workers 
  * Catering 
  * Contract Cleaning 
  * Early Learning 
  * English Language Schools 
  * Hairdressing 
  * Hotels 
  * Retail, Grocery and Allied Trades
