##  Pre-school childcare

Pre-school children are children under 6 years of age, who are not attending a
primary school or equivalent.

Pre-school services include:

  * Pre-schools 
  * Play groups 
  * Day nurseries 
  * Crèches 
  * Childminders 
  * Other similar services looking after more than 3 pre-school children 

Tusla inspects and regulates pre-school childcare services. It is also
responsible for ensuring the health, safety and welfare of pre-school children
attending pre-school childcare services.

###  **Legislation**

The [ Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth
(DCEDIY) ](https://www.gov.ie/en/policy/e9b63e-children-and-youth/) has
overall responsibility for policy and regulations in this area.

The regulation of pre-school childcare services is set out in the [ Child Care
Act 1991 (Early Years Services) Regulations 2016
](https://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2016/si/221/made/en/print) .

The regulations describe the standards of health, safety and welfare that must
be in place before such services can be provided.

Other key legislation for childcare is the [ Child Care Act 1991
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1991/en/act/pub/0017/index.html) , as amended
by the:

  * [ Child and Family Agency Act 2013 ](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2013/act/40/enacted/en/html)
  * [ Child Care Act 1991 (Early Years Services) (Amendments) Regulations 2016 ](https://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2016/si/632/made/en/print)
  * [ Child Care Act 1991 (Early Years Services) (Amendment) Regulations 2021 ](https://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2021/si/401/made/en/print)
  * [ Child Care (Amendment) Act 2022 ](https://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2022/act/21/enacted/en/print#sec1)

##  Registration of childcare providers

Childcare providers must notify Tusla that they are providing a service.

Pre-school childcare services that must register with Tusla are:

  * Sessional services 
  * Part-time day care 
  * Full day care 
  * Childminders caring for more than 3 children 
  * Pre-school service in a drop-in centre 

You can find the [ Register of Early Years Services
](https://www.tusla.ie/services/preschool-services/early-years-
providers/register-of-early-years-services-by-county/) on the Tusla website.
You can read more about the [ different types of childcare
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/education/pre-school-education-and-
childcare/your-childcare-options/#284aea) .

###  **Who does not have to register with Tusla?**

Certain pre-school care providers do not have to notify Tusla.

These include:

  * A relative of the child or the spouse of such a relative (that is, the brother, sister, aunt, uncle, grandparent or step-parent of the child) 
  * If you are caring for one or more pre-school children of the same family and no other children (other than your own) in your own home 
  * If you are caring for not more than 3 pre-school children from different families (other than your own) in your own home 

##  Childcare regulations, inspections and reports

Pre-school childcare services must meet the standards set out in the [
Childcare Regulations 2016 ](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/1a6d67-child-
care-act-1991-early-years-services-regulations-2016/) . Regulations for
registered childcare providers include measures around:

  * Health, welfare and development of the child 
  * First aid and medical assistance 
  * Adult/child and space ratios 
  * Behaviour management 
  * Register of pre-school children 
  * Information for parents 
  * Premises and facilities 
  * Safety measures 
  * Food and drink 
  * Insurance 
  * Management and staffing (see ‘Management and staffing of preschool childcare services’ below) 

Tusla has published a [ Quality and Regulatory Framework (QRF)
](https://www.tusla.ie/services/preschool-services/early-years-
providers/early-years-provider-resources/early-years-quality-and-regulatory-
framework/) , to help childcare services to comply with the 2016 regulations.
Tusla is legally obliged to regularly [ inspect childcare services
](https://www.tusla.ie/services/preschool-services/early-years-
providers/early-years-inspections-2/) to check services meet the standards
required.

All Tusla registered early years services are inspected and have an inspection
report. You can ask for a copy of the latest Tusla inspection report from the
registered pre-school childcare service, or you can find all [ Tusla
inspection reports ](https://www.tusla.ie/services/preschool-services/creche-
inspection-reports/) on the Tusla website.

###  **Health, welfare and development of the child**

Each child’s learning, development and well-being must be facilitated by the
service. The service must provide appropriate:

  * Activities and interaction 
  * Materials and equipment 
  * Care practices 

These should be appropriate based on the child’s age, stage of development,
and the number of children attending the service and the nature of their
needs.

###  **First aid and medical assistance**

There should be a suitably equipped first-aid box for children and
arrangements to call emergency medical help. A person trained in first aid for
children must be available at all times.

###  **Behaviour management**

Anyone providing a pre-school childcare service must ensure that no corporal
punishment is inflicted on any child attending the service.

The provider should have written policies and procedures to manage a child’s
challenging behaviour and to assist the child to manage their behaviour.

###  **Register of pre-school children**

A pre-school childcare provider must keep a register with details of each
child attending the service, including:

  * Name and date of birth 
  * Details of any illness, disability, allergy or special need of the child 
  * Contact numbers for parents and for each child’s doctor 
  * Written parental consent for appropriate medical treatment of the child in the event of an emergency 
  * Authorisation for the collection of the child 

###  **Information for parents**

Parents must be given information about the service, including:

  * Details of the person in charge and other staff 
  * The adult-child ratios 
  * The age range of the children 
  * The type of care and facilities offered 
  * Opening hours and fees 
  * The policies and procedures the service is required to have and maintain 

###  **Premises and facilities**

Registered pre-school services (including childminders, drop-in centres,
crèches, etc.) and premises must:

  * Be of sound and stable structure, suitable for providing pre-school services 
  * Provide adequate space per child 
  * Be kept in a proper state of repair, and be kept in a clean and hygienic condition 
  * Have adequate and suitable furniture, play and work equipment and materials available 
  * Have adequate and suitable facilities for a pre-school child to rest and to play indoors and outdoors during the day 

Buildings must also have suitable and adequate heating, ventilation and
lighting and sanitary facilities.

###  **Safety measures**

All reasonable measures must be taken to safeguard the health, safety and
welfare of a pre-school child attending the service.

Registered childcare providers must have a safety statement and policies
including:

  * Managing behaviour 
  * Authorisation to collect children 
  * Fire safety 
  * Administration of medication 
  * Infection control 
  * Safe sleep 

###  **Food and drink**

A pre-school service should ensure that food is nutritious and meets with
dietary and religious requirements.

DCEDIY has published a guide with [ nutrition standards for Early Learning and
Care Services (pdf)
](https://www.gov.ie/pdf/?file=https://assets.gov.ie/255611/6513f6cd-5b1b-45ab-a11f-e16193b146c9.pdf#page=null)
. It advises that children in day care for more than 5 hours per session (full
day care) should be offered at least 2 snacks and 2 meals, including one hot
meal.

###  **Insurance**

Pre-school children should be adequately insured against injury while
attending the service.

##  Management and staffing of pre-school childcare services

The [ Childcare Regulations of 2016
](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/1a6d67-child-care-act-1991-early-years-
services-regulations-2016/) also set out rules for how pre-school childcare
services are managed and staffed. There must be enough suitable and competent
adults working directly with children at all times.

Anyone working with pre-school children must have appropriate qualifications.

If you don’t yet have a qualification, you can [ apply for a Letter of
Temporary Permission to Practice
](https://www.gov.ie/en/service/000073-recognition-of-an-early-years-
qualification/#temporary-student-recruitment-in-early-learning-and-care) , so
long as you:

  * Have completed the first year of an approved course, and 
  * Have completed a practice placement where you worked with children as part of your studies 

DCEDIY has published a [ list of recognised qualifications (pdf)
](https://www.gov.ie/pdf/239042/?page=null) for the purposes of the
Department's childcare programmes.

All staff, students and volunteers who have access to any child in a child
care service must be [ Garda vetted
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/employment/employment-rights-and-
conditions/data-protection-at-work/garda-vetting/) . Garda vetting is a
process to check if a person working with children and vulnerable adults, or
providing services involving access to them, has a criminal record, or any
history that might pose a threat to vulnerable people.

###  **Space requirements, and ratios of adults to children**

Registered pre-school childcare services should have an appropriate ratio of
adults to children, and enough floor space for children, as set out in the
regulations.

**Pre-school service** |  **Age of children** |  **No. of adults** |  **No. of children** |  **Floor area per child**  
---|---|---|---|---  
Sessional services  |  0-1 years  |  1  |  3  |  1.818 sq. metres, maximum of 22 per room   
|  1-2.5 years  |  1  |  5  |  1.818 sq. metres, maximum of 22 per room   
|  2.5-6 years  |  1  |  11  |  1.818 sq. metres, maximum of 22 per room   
Full or part-time day care*  |  0-1 year  |  1  |  3  |  3.5 sq metres   
|  1-2 years  |  1  |  5  |  2.8 sq. metres   
|  2-3 years  |  1  |  6  |  2.35 sq. metres   
|  3-6 years  |  1  |  8  |  2.3 sq. metres   
Drop-in centres  |  0-6 years  |  1  |  4 (no more than 2 children under 15 months, unless they are siblings)  |  1.818 sq.metres, maximum of 24 per room   
Childminders  |  0-6 years  |  1  |  5 (including their own) - no more than 2 children under 15 months, unless they are siblings  |   
Overnight pre-school service  |  0-1 years  |  1  |  3  |   
|  1-6 years  |  1  |  5  |
