#  Back to Education Programme

  * Introduction 

##  Introduction

The Back to Education Programme can support you to take part in educational
and personal development courses that will help you to access employment.
There are 3 different options under the Back to Education Programme:

  1. Back to Education Allowance (which includes the Second-Level Option, the Third-Level Option and the Post-Graduate Option) 
  2. Part-Time Education Option 
  3. Education, Training and Development Option 

###  The Back to Education Allowance

The Back to Education Allowance can support people getting a social welfare
payment to access second-level and third-level education and limited post-
graduate courses. The Back to Education Allowance is paid for the duration of
your course.

You must meet certain criteria to qualify for the [ Back to Education
Allowance ](/en/social-welfare/back-to-education/back-to-education-allowance/)
and all new BTEA claims must be recommended and approved by a Department of
Social Protection (DSP) Case Officer before you start the course.

###  Part-Time Education Option

If you are unemployed, the Part-Time Education Option allows you to keep your
Jobseeker's Allowance, Jobseeker's Benefit or Jobseeker's Benefit (Self-
Employed) and attend a part-time day or evening course that will improve your
chances of getting a job (including [ Springboard courses
](/en/education/third-level-education/applying-to-college/springboard/) ). You
continue to get your jobseeker's payment at your usual rate. You must also
continue to be available for and actively seeking work. This means you still
need to _sign on_ at your Intreo Centre or Social Welfare Branch Office.

There are no specific eligibility criteria for the [ Part-Time Education
Option ](/en/social-welfare/back-to-education/part-time-education-option/) .
You can be any age and may be unemployed for any length of time before
starting a part-time course of education.

###  Education, Training and Development Option

If you are getting Jobseeker's Allowance or Jobseeker's Benefit, the
Education, Training and Development Option allows you to keep your social
welfare payment and attend a course not covered by the standard Back to
Education Allowance such as a personal development course, a basic education
course (for example, literacy classes) a general training course or specific
job skills. You continue to get your jobseeker's payment at your usual rate.

You must meet certain criteria to qualify for the [ Education, Training and
Development Option ](/en/social-welfare/back-to-education/education-training-
and-development-option/) .
