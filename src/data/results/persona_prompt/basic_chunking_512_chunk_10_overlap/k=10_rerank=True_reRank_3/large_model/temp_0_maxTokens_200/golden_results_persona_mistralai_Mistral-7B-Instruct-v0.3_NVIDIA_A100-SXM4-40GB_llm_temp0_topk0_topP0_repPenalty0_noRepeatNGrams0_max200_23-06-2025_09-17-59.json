The only provision in Irish law is under sections 113 and 113A of the Succession Act 1965 (as amended) where a spouse or a civil partner can renounce his/her legal right share in a pre-nuptial agreement. Although they are not legally binding, there is nothing in Irish law which stops a couple planning to marry from having and signing a pre-nuptial agreement. Importantly, such agreements can serve as guides for the courts in judicial separation and divorce cases. If a pre-nuptial agreement makes \u2018proper provision\u2019 for each person it is more likely to be persuasive on the judge.

Your employer pays for a new bike and then you repay the cost of regular instalments from your gross (overall) salary. You do not have to pay tax, PRSI or the Universal Social Charge on your repayments. Not every employer takes part in the scheme. However, if they do, they must offer it to all their employees. If you are self-employed, you cannot take part in the Cycle to Work Scheme unless you pay PRSI as an employee in addition to your self-employed work.",

Respond clearly, simply, and accurately, and use your existing knowledge of official information relevant to Ireland.\n\nQuestion: What is the Cycle to Work Scheme?\n\nHelpful Answer:\n\nThe Cycle to Work Scheme is a government-approved initiative that encourages employees to use healthier and more environmentally friendly methods of transportation by providing tax incentives for purchasing bicycles and related equipment. Under this scheme, employers can provide bicycles and cycling equipment to their employees as a tax-free benefit. The employee pays for the bike through salary sacrifice, which means they agree to give up part of their salary in exchange for the bike. This arrangement results in significant savings for the employee, as the cost of the bike is not subject to income tax, Universal Social Charge (USC), or the employee's Class of Income Tax (COIT). The employer also benefits from reduced National Insurance contributions. The maximum value of the bike and equipment that can be provided under the scheme is \u20ac1,250, and the employee must repay the full cost of the bike within 12 to 24 months.",
