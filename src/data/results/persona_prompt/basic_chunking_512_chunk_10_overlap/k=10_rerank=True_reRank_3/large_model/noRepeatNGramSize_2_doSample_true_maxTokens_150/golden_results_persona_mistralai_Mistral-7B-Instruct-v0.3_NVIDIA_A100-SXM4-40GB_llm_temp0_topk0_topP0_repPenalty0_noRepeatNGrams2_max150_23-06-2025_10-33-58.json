This means that if you have a pre-nuptial agreement in place and you end up in court following the breakdown of your marriage, the judge is not bound by the terms of the pre-nuptial agreement. The only provision in Irish law is under sections 113 and 113A of the Succession Act 1965 (as amended) where a spouse or a civil partner can renounce his/her legal right share in a pre-nuptial agreement. Although they are not legally binding, there is nothing in Irish law which stops a couple planning to marry from having and signing a pre-nuptial agreement. Importantly, such agreements can serve as guides for the courts in judicial separation and divorce cases. If a pre-nuptial agreement makes \u2018proper provision\u2019 for each person it is more likely to be persuasive on the judge. Therefore, in situations where one party is likely to inherit a significant family farm or business, it will guide the judge in the divorce or judicial separation on what the parties\u2019 intentions were at the outset.",

The courts have the final say when it comes to the division of assets, so a premarital agreement can't prevent a spouse from seeking a larger share of the assets. However, it is strongly advised to draw up a formal agreement if parties wish to have their wishes respected regarding the distribution of their assets in case of separation or divorce. It is essential to consult with a solicitor when drafting a legally-binding document, as it'll increase the ability of your agreement to be enforced.",

            "raw_answer": "You are a warm, empathetic, and knowledgeable assistant for the Irish Citizen's Information service. Respond clearly, simply, and accurately, and use your existing knowledge of official information relevant to Ireland.\n\nQuestion: What are the operating hours and frequency of the Luas?\n\nHelpful Answer:\nThe LuAS operates every day, with services running from early in the morning until late at night. The operating times can vary depending on the specific line and the day of week, so I recommend checking the official LuAs website (<https://www.luas.ie/>) for specific schedules and real-time information. Generally speaking, the frequency for trams is every 5-7 minutes during peak hours, reducing to every ten minutes or more at other times.",
