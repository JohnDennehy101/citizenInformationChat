Respond clearly, simply, and accurately, and use your existing knowledge of official information relevant to Ireland.\n\nQuestion: Do I have a right to redundancy pay?\n\nHelpful Answer:\nIf you're being made redundant, you're entitled to redundancy pay if you've been employed for at least 2 years. The amount of pay you're entitled to depends on how long you've worked for the company. Here's how it works:\n\n*   If you've worked for 2 years or more, you're entitled to 12 weeks' pay (or 1 week's pay for every year you've worked, up to a maximum of 12 weeks).\n*   If you've worked for 1-2 years, you're entitled to 1 week's pay for every year you've worked, up to a maximum of 6 weeks.\n*   If you've worked for less than 1 year, you're not entitled to redundancy pay.\n\nRedundancy pay is usually paid in full, but you may have to pay back any overpaid redundancy pay if you start work for a new employer within 1 month of receiving the payment.\n\nYou can claim redundancy pay from the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection. You'll need to fill out a claim form and provide some basic information about your employment. If you're unsure about your entitlement to redundancy pay, you can contact the Department for more information.\n\nIt's worth noting that redundancy pay is usually paid out of your own pocket, but you may be able to claim it back if you start work for a new employer within 1 month of receiving the payment.

This means that if you have a pre-nuptial agreement in place and you end up in court following the breakdown of your marriage, the judge is not bound by the terms of the pre-nuptial agreement. The only provision in Irish law is under sections 113 and 113A of the Succession Act 1965 (as amended) where a spouse or a civil partner can renounce his/her legal right share in a pre-nuptial agreement. Although they are not legally binding, there is nothing in Irish law which stops a couple planning to marry from having and signing a pre-nuptial agreement. Importantly, such agreements can serve as guides for the courts in judicial separation and divorce cases. If a pre-nuptial agreement makes \u2018proper provision\u2019 for each person it is more likely to be persuasive on the judge. Therefore, in situations where one party is likely to inherit a significant family farm or business, it will guide the judge in the divorce or judicial separation on what the parties\u2019 intentions were at the outset.",

The legal status of pre-nuptial agreements in Ireland is governed by the Family Law (Divorce) Act 1987 and the Family Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2019.\n\nIn Ireland, pre-nuptial agreements are not automatically recognized by law, but they can be binding if certain conditions are met. The key factors are:\n\n1. **Voluntariness**: Both parties must enter into the agreement voluntarily, without any coercion or undue influence.\n2. **Disclose information**: Both parties must disclose all relevant financial information to each other.\n3. **Fair and reasonable**: The agreement must be fair and reasonable, taking into account the financial circumstances of both parties.\n4. **Not contrary to Irish law**: The agreement must not be contrary to any Irish law, including the Constitution.\n\nIf a pre-nuptial agreement meets these conditions, it can be recognized by the courts in Ireland. However, if it does not meet these conditions, the court may not recognize it, and it may be struck down.\n\nIt's essential to note that pre-nuptial agreements are not a substitute for a marriage contract or a marriage ceremony. They are a separate document that aims to clarify the financial arrangements between two people before they get married.\n\nIf you're considering entering into a pre-nuptial agreement, it's recommended that you seek advice from a qualified solicitor or a financial advisor to ensure that the agreement is fair, reasonable, and meets the necessary conditions.\n\nWould you like me to elaborate on anything or provide more information?",
