            "raw_answer": "You are a warm, empathetic, and knowledgeable assistant for the Irish Citizen's Information service. Respond clearly, simply, and accurately, and use your existing knowledge of official information relevant to Ireland.\n\nQuestion: Do I have a right to redundancy pay?\n\nHelpful Answer:\nHello! I'd be happy to help you with your question.\n\nRedundancy pay, also known as statutory redundancy pay, is a payment you're entitled to if you're made redundant. To qualify, you must meet certain conditions.\n\nFirst, you need to have been employed for at least 2 years (or 1 year if you're under 22) and be employed by the same employer for at least 1 year.\n\nSecond, your employer must be making you redundant due to redundancy. This means they're dismissing you because of circumstances beyond your control, such as:\n\n* The closure of the workplace\n* The closure of the business\n* A reduction in the number of employees\n* A transfer of the business to another country\n* A reorganisation of the business\n\nIf you meet these conditions, you're entitled to statutory redundancy pay, which is calculated based on your age and length of service.\n\nFor example, if you're 22-40 years old and have been employed for at least 1 year, you'll get:\n\n* 1 week's pay for each year of service, up to a maximum of 12 weeks\n\nIf you're 41 years old or over and have been employed for at least 2 years, you'll get:\n\n* 2 weeks' pay for each year of service, up to a maximum of 26 weeks\n\nKeep in mind that these are general guidelines, and your employer may have their own policies or procedures for calculating redundancy pay.\n\nIf you're unsure about your entitlement to redundancy pay or need more information, I recommend speaking with your HR representative or a qualified employment law expert. They can provide you with more specific guidance and help you understand your rights.\n\nIs there anything else I can help you with?",

This means that if you have a pre-nuptial agreement in place and you end up in court following the breakdown of your marriage, the judge is not bound by the terms of the pre-nuptial agreement. The only provision in Irish law is under sections 113 and 113A of the Succession Act 1965 (as amended) where a spouse or a civil partner can renounce his/her legal right share in a pre-nuptial agreement. Although they are not legally binding, there is nothing in Irish law which stops a couple planning to marry from having and signing a pre-nuptial agreement. Importantly, such agreements can serve as guides for the courts in judicial separation and divorce cases. If a pre-nuptial agreement makes \u2018proper provision\u2019 for each person it is more likely to be persuasive on the judge. Therefore, in situations where one party is likely to inherit a significant family farm or business, it will guide the judge in the divorce or judicial separation on what the parties\u2019 intentions were at the outset.",

Respond clearly, simply, and accurately, and use your existing knowledge of official information relevant to Ireland.\n\nQuestion: What is the legal status of pre-nuptial agreements?\n\nHelpful Answer:\nA pre-nuptial agreement is a contract between two people who are getting married, which outlines how their assets will be divided in the event of a divorce or separation. In Ireland, pre-nuptial agreements are legally binding, but they are not recognized as a valid ground for divorce. \n\nThis is because the Matrimonial Proceedings Act 1996 states that a pre-nuptial agreement can only be used to determine the division of property in the event of a divorce or separation, and not as a ground for divorce itself.\n\nHowever, pre-nuptial agreements can be useful for couples who want to protect their individual assets and financial independence in the event of a separation. They can also help to reduce the risk of disputes over property and financial matters in the event of a divorce.\n\nIt's worth noting that pre-nuptial agreements must be in writing and signed by both parties, and they must be made before the marriage takes place. If a pre-nuptial agreement is not made before the marriage, it is not legally binding.\n\nIf you're considering entering into a pre-nuptial agreement, it's recommended that you seek advice from a qualified solicitor who specializes in family law. They can help you understand your rights and obligations under the law and ensure that the agreement is fair and reasonable.",
