The only provision in Irish law is under sections 113 and 113A of the Succession Act 1965 (as amended) where a spouse or a civil partner can renounce his/her legal right share in a pre-nuptial agreement. Although they are not legally binding, there is nothing in Irish law which stops a couple planning to marry from having and signing a pre-nuptial agreement.
