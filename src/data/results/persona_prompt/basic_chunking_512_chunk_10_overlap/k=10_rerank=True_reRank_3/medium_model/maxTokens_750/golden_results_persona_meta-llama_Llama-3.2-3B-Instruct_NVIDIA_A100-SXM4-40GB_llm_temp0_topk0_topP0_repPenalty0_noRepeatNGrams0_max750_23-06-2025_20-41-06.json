Respond clearly, simply, and accurately, and use your existing knowledge of official information relevant to Ireland.\n\nQuestion: Do I have a right to redundancy pay?\n\nHelpful Answer:\nYes, you have a right to redundancy pay under the Redundancy Payments Act 1967. This Act provides for payment to employees who are made redundant. The amount of pay you are entitled to depends on the length of time you've worked for the employer and how long you've been in your current job.\n\nTo qualify for redundancy pay, you'll need to meet the following criteria:\n\n*   You must have worked for your employer for at least 2 years.\n*   You must have been employed in your current job for at least 1 year.\n*   Your employer must have made you redundant through no fault of your own.\n*   Your employer must have given you adequate notice before making you redundant.\n\nIf you meet these criteria, your employer must pay you a minimum of 1 week's pay per year of service up to 12 years of service. For every year of service beyond 12 years, you'll get 1 week's pay per year.\n\nFor example, if you've worked for 10 years, you'll get 10 weeks' pay. If you've worked for 20 years, you'll get 20 weeks' pay.\n\nIt's worth noting that your employer may pay you more than the minimum amount, but they're not required to do so. If you're unsure about your entitlement to redundancy pay, you can contact the Citizens Information Service or the Labour Relations Commission for guidance. They can help you understand your rights and what you can do if you're not being paid the correct amount.",

This means that if you have a pre-nuptial agreement in place and you end up in court following the breakdown of your marriage, the judge is not bound by the terms of the pre-nuptial agreement. The only provision in Irish law is under sections 113 and 113A of the Succession Act 1965 (as amended) where a spouse or a civil partner can renounce his/her legal right share in a pre-nuptial agreement. Although they are not legally binding, there is nothing in Irish law which stops a couple planning to marry from having and signing a pre-nuptial agreement. Importantly, such agreements can serve as guides for the courts in judicial separation and divorce cases. If a pre-nuptial agreement makes \u2018proper provision\u2019 for each person it is more likely to be persuasive on the judge. Therefore, in situations where one party is likely to inherit a significant family farm or business, it will guide the judge in the divorce or judicial separation on what the parties\u2019 intentions were at the outset.",

Respond clearly, simply, and accurately, and use your existing knowledge of official information relevant to Ireland.\n\nQuestion: What is the legal status of pre-nuptial agreements?\n\nHelpful Answer:\nA pre-nuptial agreement, also known as a pre-nup, is a contract between two people who are about to get married. It's a voluntary agreement that outlines how their assets, debts, and other property will be divided in the event of a divorce or the death of one partner.\n\nIn Ireland, pre-nuptial agreements are legally recognized and can be used to protect individual assets, but they are not binding on the state or the other partner. This means that the state can still intervene in certain circumstances, such as if there are concerns about child support or if one partner has a significant amount of debt.\n\nTo be valid, a pre-nuptial agreement must be:\n\n* Written and signed by both partners\n* Fair and reasonable\n* Made in good faith\n* Not coerced or influenced by one partner\n\nIf a pre-nuptial agreement is not valid, the court may still consider it as evidence of the parties' intentions when deciding on property division in the event of a divorce.\n\nIt's worth noting that pre-nuptial agreements can be useful for protecting individual assets, but they should not be seen as a way to avoid financial responsibility or to limit one's entitlement to state benefits.
