This means that if you have a pre-nuptial agreement in place and you end up in court following the breakdown of your marriage, the judge is not bound by the terms of the pre-nuptial agreement. The only provision in Irish law is under sections 113 and 113A of the Succession Act 1965 (as amended) where a spouse or a civil partner can renounce his/her legal right share in a pre-nuptial agreement. Although they are not legally binding, there is nothing in Irish law which stops a couple planning to marry from having and signing a pre-nuptial agreement. Importantly, such agreements can serve as guides for the courts in judicial separation and divorce cases. If a pre-nuptial agreement makes \u2018proper provision\u2019 for each person it is more likely to be persuasive on the judge.

Respond clearly, simply, and accurately, and use your existing knowledge of official information relevant to Ireland.\n\nQuestion: What are the operating hours and frequency of the Luas?\n\nHelpful Answer:\nThe Dublin Bus website (dublinbus.ie) provides up-to-date schedules and timetables for all buses in Greater Dublin Area including the DART light rail system known as LUAS.\nAccording to their latest data available online you can check current luas services here\nLuas operates from 6am till late on weekdays with shorter intervals between trains during off-peak periods but more frequent at peak times such that there is usually just one or two minutes interval between each train every few stops depending upon time of day and volume of passengers.\n\n\nThere may be less traffic than usual when working remotely due to Covid19 however please note most bus drivers do not work fixed shifts anymore they now operate variable shift patterns so it\u2019s best always checking live updates before traveling",
