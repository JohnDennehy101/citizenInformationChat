According to the Residential Tenancies Act 2004, a valid reason for ending a tenancy early is if the landlord has not carried out the necessary repairs to the property within a reasonable time frame. This is often referred to as \"breach of covenant\" or \"breach of contract\".\n\nFor example, if the landlord has failed to fix a leaky roof or a broken heating system, and you have given them a reasonable amount of time to do so, you may be able to end the tenancy early.\n\nIt's worth noting that you will need to provide evidence of the repairs that were not carried out, and you may need to give your landlord a formal notice to quit before you can end the tenancy.\n\nAdditionally, if you are a tenant, you should also be aware that you have the right to request repairs from your landlord, and you can do this by giving them written notice of the repairs that",

The only provision in Irish law is under sections 113 and 113A of the Succession Act 1965 (as amended) where a spouse or a civil partner can renounce his/her legal right share in a pre-nuptial agreement. Although they are not legally binding, there is nothing in Irish law which stops a couple planning to marry from having and signing a pre-nuptial agreement. Importantly, such agreements can serve as guides for the courts in judicial separation and divorce cases. If a pre-nuptial agreement makes \u2018proper provision\u2019 for each person it is more likely to be persuasive on the judge.
