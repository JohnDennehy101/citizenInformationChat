You can get the grant if you are refurbishing the vacant property so you can live there, or so you can rent the property out. You can get a grant of up to \u20ac50,000 to renovate a vacant property and up to \u20ac70,000, if the property is derelict. You can get more if you are living on an off-shore island. And, there is an additional grant for expert conservation advice if you are refurbishing a vacant traditional farmhouse. The Vacant Property Refurbishment Grant is funded by the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage through the Cro\u00ed C\u00f3naithe (Towns) Fund and you apply to your local authority.

The points are used to determine if a driver is at risk of losing their driving licence.\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n*   Points are added to a driver's record for each offence.\n*   The points are used to calculate a driver's licence penalty points total.\n*   The total number of points is compared to a set of rules to determine if the driver is at risk of losing their licence.\n*   If the driver has accumulated 12 points or more in a 3-year period, they are at risk of losing their licence.\n\nPenalty points can be added for various driving offences, including:\n\n*   Excessive speeding\n*   Reckless driving\n*   Failure to stop at a stop sign or red light\n*   Driving without insurance\n*   Driving without a valid driving licence\n\nDrivers can check their penalty points record online or by contacting the NDLS. They can also appeal against penalty points if they believe they were unfairly penalised.\n\nIf a driver is at risk of losing their licence, they can take steps to reduce their points total or appeal against the penalty points. This may include:\n\n*   Completing a driving course or training programme\n*   Paying a fine or penalty charge\n*   Appealing against the penalty points\n\nIt's essential to note that penalty points can have a significant impact on a driver's licence and insurance costs.

The amount of pay you're entitled to depends on the length of your service and the type of contract you have.\n\nIf you've been employed for 2-12 years, you'll be entitled to 1-2 weeks' pay per year of service, depending on the type of contract. If you've been employed for more than 12 years, you'll be entitled to 2 weeks' pay per year of service.\n\nFor example, if you've been employed for 5 years, you might be entitled to 5 weeks' pay (1 week x 5 years). However, if you're on a fixed-term contract or a contract with a fixed term, you might not be entitled to redundancy pay.\n\nIt's also worth noting that if you're being made redundant due to a business closure, you might be entitled to a notice period, which is usually 4-6 weeks.\n\nIf you're unsure about your entitlement to redundancy pay, I recommend speaking with your employer or a trade union representative.

This means that if you have a pre-nuptial agreement in place and you end up in court following the breakdown of your marriage, the judge is not bound by the terms of the pre-nuptial agreement. The only provision in Irish law is under sections 113 and 113A of the Succession Act 1965 (as amended) where a spouse or a civil partner can renounce his/her legal right share in a pre-nuptial agreement. Although they are not legally binding, there is nothing in Irish law which stops a couple planning to marry from having and signing a pre-nuptial agreement. Importantly, such agreements can serve as guides for the courts in judicial separation and divorce cases. If a pre-nuptial agreement makes \u2018proper provision\u2019 for each person it is more likely to be persuasive on the judge.

It outlines how their assets and debts will be divided in the event of a divorce or death.\n\nIn Ireland, pre-nuptial agreements are recognized by law, but they are not automatically enforceable. This means that the courts will not automatically enforce the terms of a pre-nup, even if both parties have signed it.\n\nHowever, if both parties have independent legal advice and the agreement is made with full understanding and consent, the courts may take the agreement into account when making a decision about the division of assets and debts in the event of a divorce or death.\n\nIt's worth noting that the courts may not enforce a pre-nup if:\n\n* One party did not receive independent legal advice\n* One party did not have full understanding and consent\n* The agreement is unfair or unreasonable\n* The agreement is not in writing\n\nIf you're considering getting married, it's a good idea to have a pre-nup, but it's also important to make sure that it's fair, reasonable, and made with full understanding and consent. You may also want to consider seeking independent legal advice to ensure that your rights are protected.\n\nFor more information, you can also check the following resources:\n\n* The Irish Law Reform Commission's report on pre-nuptial agreements\n* The Family Law Act 1996\n* The Supreme Court's decision in the case of A v A (2015)\n\nIs there anything else I can help you with?",
