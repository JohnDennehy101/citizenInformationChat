The only provision in Irish law is under sections 113 and 113A of the Succession Act 1965 (as amended) where a spouse or a civil partner can renounce his/her legal right share in a pre-nuptial agreement. Although they are not legally binding, there is nothing in Irish law which stops a couple planning to marry from having and signing a pre-nuptial agreement.

Respond clearly, simply, and accurately, and use your existing knowledge of official information relevant to Ireland.\n\nQuestion: What are the operating hours and frequency of the Luas?\n\nHelpful Answer:\nThe Luas operates on a schedule that typically includes frequent departures from key stations during peak times (such as morning and evening rush hour), with less frequent services in between. During weekdays, the Luas generally runs every 5-10 minutes during peak periods, while off-peak times can see more than an hour between trains. On weekends and holidays, train frequencies may decrease further, but they still operate consistently throughout the day.\nPlease note that actual schedules can vary depending on factors such as weather conditions or station closures, so it's best to check the current schedule online before planning your trip.
