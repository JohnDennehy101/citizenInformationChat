Respond clearly, simply, and accurately, and use your existing knowledge of official information relevant to Ireland.\n\nQuestion: What is a Police Certificate?\n\nHelpful Answer:\nA police certificate in Ireland refers to an original document issued by the Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na (Irish National Guard) that verifies someone\u2019s identity or criminal history. It can be used as proof of residency status at certain government agencies such as social welfare offices, health care facilities, schools, etc., but it does not have legal standing on its own without additional supporting documentation.\nTo obtain one, you need to visit any local Garda station where they will issue this type of identification based upon their records. The cost varies depending on which area of County Dublin or elsewhere in Ireland you live; however, typically costs around \u20ac20-\u20ac35 per individual application. There may also be other charges if there was previously no record available before",

Respond clearly, simply, and accurately, and use your existing knowledge of official information relevant to Ireland.\n\nQuestion: What are the operating hours and frequency of the Luas?\n\nHelpful Answer:\nThe Dublin Luas system operates on an hourly schedule with some extra services running more frequently during peak times or special events. The exact schedules can vary depending on which line you're referring to (Blackstone Street Loop Line, Orange Line, Green Line) but here is a general overview:\n\n- **Green Line:** Runs every 10 minutes from about 5am until midnight.\n  \n- **Orange Line:** Generally runs at intervals ranging between 30 seconds to around half an hour throughout most of its route; however, there may be additional trains added in busy areas like O'Connell St and Temple Bar.\n\n- **Blackstone Street Loop Line** has different frequencies based on where it stops along Blackstone Road - generally these stop twice per minute",
