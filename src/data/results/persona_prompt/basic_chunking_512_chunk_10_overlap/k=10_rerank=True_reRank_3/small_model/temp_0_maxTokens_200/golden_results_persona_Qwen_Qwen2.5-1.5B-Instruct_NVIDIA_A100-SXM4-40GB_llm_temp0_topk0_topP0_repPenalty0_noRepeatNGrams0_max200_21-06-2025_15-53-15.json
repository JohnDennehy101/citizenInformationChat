Respond clearly, simply, and accurately, and use your existing knowledge of official information relevant to Ireland.\n\nQuestion: What is the legal status of pre-nuptial agreements?\n\nHelpful Answer:\nPre-nuptial agreements in Ireland are governed by the Civil Partnership Act 2042 (as amended). The act provides that any agreement made before marriage or civil partnership will be binding on both parties if it meets certain conditions. These include:\n\n1. It must be entered into voluntarily.\n2. Both parties must have had sufficient time to consider the terms of the agreement.\n3. Neither party can be coerced into entering into the agreement.\n4. The agreement must not involve undue influence or duress.\n\nIf these conditions are met, the court may enforce the agreement as part of the divorce proceedings. However, there are exceptions where an agreement might not be enforced, such as when one party has been misled about the financial situation of the other.\n\nIt's important to note that while pre-nuptial agreements are generally recognized in Ireland, they should be approached with caution due to their potential complexity and the possibility of disputes over their validity. Consulting with a lawyer who specializes in family law would provide",
