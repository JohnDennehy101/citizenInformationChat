            "ground_truth": "Pre-nuptial agreements have no basis in law in Ireland. As a result, they are not strictly binding. This means that if you have a pre-nuptial agreement in place and you end up in court following the breakdown of your marriage, the judge is not bound by the terms of the pre-nuptial agreement. The only provision in Irish law is under sections 113 and 113A of the Succession Act 1965 (as amended) where a spouse or a civil partner can renounce his/her legal right share in a pre-nuptial agreement. Although they are not legally binding, there is nothing in Irish law which stops a couple planning to marry from having and signing a pre-nuptial agreement. Importantly, such agreements can serve as guides for the courts in judicial separation and divorce cases. If a pre-nuptial agreement makes \u2018proper provision\u2019 for each person it is more likely to be persuasive on the judge. Therefore, in situations where one party is likely to inherit a significant family farm or business, it will guide the judge in the divorce or judicial separation on what the parties\u2019 intentions were at the outset.",

Respond clearly, simply, and accurately, and use your existing knowledge of official information relevant to Ireland.\n\nQuestion: What is the legal status of pre-nuptial agreements?\n\nHelpful Answer:\nPre-nuptial agreements in Ireland have gained popularity as a way for couples to address financial issues before marriage. The Legal Aid Board provides guidance on these agreements, which can be useful if one partner has assets that could potentially benefit from being protected or distributed differently than the other spouse's assets. However, it's important to note that while these agreements can provide clarity during divorce proceedings, they do not guarantee a favorable outcome. It\u2019s advisable to seek professional advice tailored to individual circumstances before entering into such an agreement.\nThe Irish Civil Partnership Act 2042 came into effect on January 1st, 2019, making civil partnerships available to same-sex couples who were previously only able to marry in England and Wales. This act also includes provisions for dissolution of civil partnership by mutual consent, similar to divorce but with some differences in procedure and process.
