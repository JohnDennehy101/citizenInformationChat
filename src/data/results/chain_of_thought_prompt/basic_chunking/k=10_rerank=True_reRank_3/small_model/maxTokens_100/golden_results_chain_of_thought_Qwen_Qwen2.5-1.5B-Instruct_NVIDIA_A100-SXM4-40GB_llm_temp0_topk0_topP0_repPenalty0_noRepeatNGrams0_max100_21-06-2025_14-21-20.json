This concept is often used in property law, taxation, and inheritance laws to determine which state or country a person's property belongs to.

This situation violates the lease agreement and the landlord's rights under local laws regarding overdue payments. The landlord may choose to give the tenant an opportunity to pay up, but if they fail to do so, it can lead to eviction proceedings. Another reason might be if the tenant has been causing significant damage to the property without proper repairs being made. In such cases, the",

This means that if you have a pre-nuptial agreement in place and you end up in court following the breakdown of your marriage, the judge is not bound by the terms of the pre-nuptial agreement. The only provision in Irish law is under sections 113 and 113A of the Succession Act 1965 (as amended) where a spouse or a civil partner can renounce his/her legal right share in a pre-nuptial agreement. Although they are not legally binding, there is nothing in Irish law which stops a couple planning to marry from having and signing a pre-nuptial agreement. Importantly, such agreements can serve as guides for the courts in judicial separation and divorce cases. If a pre-nuptial agreement makes \u2018proper provision\u2019 for each person it is more likely to be persuasive on the judge. Therefore, in situations where one party is likely to inherit a significant family farm or business, it will guide the judge in the divorce or judicial separation on what the parties\u2019 intentions were at the outset.",

Generally, they are recognized and enforceable in many countries, including the United States, but their validity can be subject to specific laws and court rulings. In some cases, courts may refuse to recognize them altogether, especially those that were entered under duress or lack transparency.
