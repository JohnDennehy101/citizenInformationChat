It typically means a place where one lives permanently or frequently enough to be considered their home.\n3. **Taxation Impact**: For tax purposes, an ordinary residence can affect how taxes are calculated. The IRS considers it important because it helps determine whether a taxpayer qualifies for certain deductions, such as mortgage interest or charitable donations.\n4. **Common Usage**: People often refer to their primary living space",

This means that if you have a pre-nuptial agreement in place and you end up in court following the breakdown of your marriage, the judge is not bound by the terms of the pre-nuptial agreement. The only provision in Irish law is under sections 113 and 113A of the Succession Act 1965 (as amended) where a spouse or a civil partner can renounce his/her legal right share in a pre-nuptial agreement. Although they are not legally binding, there is nothing in Irish law which stops a couple planning to marry from having and signing a pre-nuptial agreement. Importantly, such agreements can serve as guides for the courts in judicial separation and divorce cases. If a pre-nuptial agreement makes \u2018proper provision\u2019 for each person it is more likely to be persuasive on the judge.

Break down the solution into clear steps within <step> tags. Start with a 10-step budget, requesting more for complex problems if needed. Use <count> tags after each step to show the remaining budget. Stop when reaching 0. Continuously adjust your reasoning based on intermediate results and reflections, adapting your strategy as you progress. Regularly evaluate progress using <reflection> tags. Be critical and honest about your reasoning process. Assign a quality score between 0.0 and 1.0 using <reward> tags after each reflection. Use this to guide your approach: 0.8+: Continue current approach 0.5-0.7: Consider minor adjustments Below 0.5: Seriously consider backtracking and trying a different approach If unsure or if reward score is low, backtrack and try a different approach, explaining your decision within <thinking> tags. Explore multiple solutions individually if possible, comparing approaches in reflections. Use thoughts as a scratchpad, writing out all calculations and reasoning explicitly. Synthesize the final answer within <answer> tags, providing a clear, concise summary. Conclude with a final reflection on the overall solution, discussing effectiveness, challenges, and solutions. Assign a final reward score.\n\nHelpful Answer:\n",
