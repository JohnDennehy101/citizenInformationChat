It happens when your job in the company no longer exists, you are let go and are not replaced.\n\nRedundancy is a last option\n\nYour employer must consult with you before deciding to make you redundant. Redundancy is a last option and there must be valid economic, technical, or organisational grounds justifying changes in the workforce.\n\nBefore your employer makes you redundant, they might offer you another job in the business. This is known as \u2018 alternative work \u2019.\n\nWhat counts as genuine redundancy?\n\nYour employer must be able to justify that there is a genuine reason for making you redundant.\n\nA genuine redundancy is one where your employer has a real business reason to make you redundant.\n\nReasons for redundancy include:\n\nFinancial difficulties within the business: for example, your employer needs to cut costs and this means staff numbers must be reduced.\n\nLack of work : for example, your employer no longer needs or has a reduced need for employees with your skills or new technology has made your job unnecessary.\n\nReorganisation within the business: for example, your employer has decided to carry on the business with fewer or no staff or the job you do no longer exists.\n\nBusiness closure : the business is closing down or moving.\n\nThe difference between redundancy and dismissal\n\nRedundancy\n\nRedundancy is dismissal from your job, caused by your employer needing to reduce the workforce resulting in your job no longer existing.\n\nThe burden of proof is on your employer to show that a legitimate redundancy situation exists and that therefore the dismissal is fair.\n\nFor the dismissal to be fair, your employer must also show that you were fairly selected for redundancy and that fair procedures were followed.\n\nIf you do not agree that the dismissal is fair, you need to show one or more of the following:Document 1:::\nEnglish | Gaeilge\n\nYou are here: Home > Employment > Unemployment and redundancy > Dismissal > Unfair dismissal\n\nUnfair dismissal\n\nWhat is unfair dismissal?\n\nCan I bring a claim for unfair dismissal?\n\nWho cannot bring a claim for unfair dismissal?\n\nHow to bring a claim for unfair dismissal\n\nIf your claim is successful\n\nDismissal from fixed-term or specified-purpose contracts\n\nMore information\n\nWhat is unfair dismissal?\n\nIf you are dismissed from work, the dismissal is automatically considered to be \u2018unfair\u2019 if you are dismissed for:\n\nMembership (or proposed membership) of a trade union, or for engaging in trade union activities\n\nReligious or political opinions\n\nLegal proceedings against an employer where you are a party or a witness\n\nRace, colour, sexual orientation, age, or membership of the Traveller community\n\nPregnancy, giving birth, breastfeeding, or any other matters connected with pregnancy or birth (such as attending antenatal classes)\n\nAvailing of rights under legislation to maternity leave, adoptive leave, paternity leave, carer\u2019s leave, parent\u2019s leave, parental leave or force majeure leave\n\nUnfair selection for redundancy\n\nMaking a protected disclosure (that is, where you raise concerns about possible wrongdoing at work) under the Protected Disclosures Act 2014\n\nUnfair dismissal happens where:\n\nYour employer ends your contract of employment, with or without notice\n\nYou end your contract of employment, with or without notice, due to the conduct of your employer. This is known as constructive dismissal.\n\nWhat does not count as \u2018unfair\u2019 dismissal?\n\nYour dismissal from work is not \u2018unfair\u2019 if it results from:\n\nYour capability, competence or qualifications for the job\n\nYour conduct (behaviour)\n\nYou being unable to work (or continue to work) in the position you held without breaking the law (for example, if your job involves driving and you are then legally disqualified from driving)\n\nYour redundancy (read more about redundancy below)\n\nIn general, redundancy is a fair reason for dismissal. However, you may have grounds (reasons) for complaint if you were unfairly selected for redundancy , or if you feel there was no genuine need for redundancy.\n\nUnless your employer can prove there was a genuine redundancy situation and that they followed fair procedures , your dismissal may be considered \u2018unfair\u2019.\n\nIf you make a claim for unfair dismissal, you cannot also claim redundancy.\n\nCan I bring a claim for unfair dismissal?Document 2:::\nYou are made redundant on carer\u2019s leave\n\nIf you are dismissed on grounds of redundancy, while on carer\u2019s leave , under the Carer\u2019s Leave Act 2001 it would be considered unfair dismissal.\n\nIf your employer does not allow you to return to work at the end of your carer\u2019s leave you may be able to bring a claim under the unfair dismissals legislation. However you may be made redundant after you have returned to work.\n\nI think I was unfairly selected or there wasn\u2019t a genuine redundancy\n\nsituation\n\nIf you feel that your employer has selected you unfairly, or that there was no genuine redundancy situation, you can bring a claim for unfair dismissal.\n\nYou think you were unfairly selected\n\nYour employer should use fair and reasonable selection criteria in choosing people to make redundant.\n\nExamples where your selection could be unfair include:\n\nWhere the custom and practice in your workplace has been last in, first out and your selection did not follow this procedure\n\nWhere your employment contract sets out criteria for selection which were not followed\n\nYour redundancy is unfair if your employer has discriminated in selecting you for redundancy. For example if they make you redundant because you\u2019re pregnant or on maternity leave.\n\nYour employer could also have chosen you for an unfair reason. Unfair reasons include making you redundant because you\u2019ve asked for one of your legal rights, made a health and safety complaint or been on an official strike.\n\nYou think there was no genuine redundancy situation\n\nA genuine redundancy is one where your employer has a real business reason to make you redundant.\n\nSigns your redundancy might not be a genuine include:\n\nYour employer has recently hired new employees to do similar work\n\nYou have a bad relationship with your employer or other people at work\n\nYou are singled out or treated differently from other people at work\n\nThe laws on redundancy\n\nThe laws on redundancy are set out in the Redundancy Payments Acts 1967\u20132014 .\n\nThe requirements to consult on collective redundancies are set out in the Protection of Employment Acts 1977-2024 as amended, and the Employees (Provision of Information and Consultation) Act 2006.\n\nMore information\n\nYou can get more information about your employment rights from the WRC.

To apply, individuals must meet certain criteria including being under 70 years old without any means testing, either under 8 years old or over 70 years old receiving benefits like Carer's Allowance or Carer's Benefit at full or half-rate.\n</answer>\n\nReflections:\nIn my previous attempt, I focused too narrowly on the eligibility requirements rather than comprehensively defining what a GP visit card actually is. The definition should encompass both its purpose and benefits. Reflecting further, I realized that while the application process was correctly identified, it was necessary to delve deeper into what exactly constitutes a GP visit card. \n\nI decided to break down the concept into two main components - its function (providing free GP visits) and its recipients (those who meet specific financial qualifications). By doing so, I could ensure that the response accurately reflects the nature of the card itself rather than just listing the conditions for applying.\n\nThis revision allows for a clearer understanding of the GP visit card's role and the criteria required to obtain it. It maintains consistency with the original content while adding depth to the explanation. The revised structure ensures that the definition of the card is presented in a comprehensive manner, making it easier for readers to grasp its essence. \n\nTherefore, I am satisfied with the revised answer and will proceed with implementing these changes in the next iteration. My confidence has increased due to the careful consideration of the definitions involved, which now form a cohesive whole that better captures the essence of a GP visit card. \n\nMy reward score for this segment is set at 0.8+, indicating that the approach remains valid and effective despite some initial inaccuracies. Backtracking would not be advisable since the core message has been preserved and improved upon, ensuring clarity and accuracy. Instead, I plan to continue refining the wording and structure until the final version meets the desired standards. \n\nMoving forward, I will focus on delivering an informative yet precise answer that effectively communicates the key aspects of what a GP visit card entails, thus reinforcing my commitment to achieving a high-quality output. This approach aligns with the goal of enhancing comprehension and reducing errors, leading to a more reliable outcome. \n\nThroughout this process, I have learned the importance of breaking down complex ideas into simpler, more digestible parts. This technique proved particularly useful in creating a clear and accurate definition of the GP visit card. By focusing on",

Assign a final reward score.\n\nHelpful Answer:\nTo determine who can get a GP visit card, let's break down the eligibility criteria:\n\n1. **Ordinary Resident**: You must be ordinarily resident in Ireland, meaning you are living there permanently.\n2. **Age Limits**:\n   - **Under 70**: Eligibility depends on means testing.\n     - **No Means Test**: You can apply without a means test if you meet certain conditions like being aged under 8, receiving Carer\u2019s Benefit or Carer\u2019s Allowance at full or half-rate, or qualifying for a GP visit card.\n     - **Means Test**: Your income is assessed against the HSE's basic rates of income. \n     - Income limits vary depending on your marital status and dependents.\n3. **Special Eligibility Conditions**:\n   - **Children Under 8**: Eligible with no means test, starting from age 6 and 7.\n4. **Medical Card Eligibility**:\n   - If you have a medical card, your child is automatically eligible for a GP visit card.\n5. **Other Eligibility Factors**:\n   - No restrictions exist beyond the above factors for those who are ordinarily resident and meet other conditions.\n\nBy breaking down these criteria systematically, we ensure clarity and avoid overlooking important details. Each step builds upon the previous one, ensuring comprehensive coverage. Let's summarize the findings:\n\n- Ordinary residents aged 70 and older can apply without means tests.\n- Children under 8 and those aged 6 and 7 qualify directly.\n- For adults, income assessment determines eligibility, with additional allowance for children.\n- Additional benefits like Carer\u2019s Benefit, direct provision, cancer diagnosis, and fostering allow for automatic GP visit card eligibility.\n- Existing medical card holders gain immediate access to GP visit cards.\n\nThis structured breakdown ensures that every potential applicant meets the necessary criteria, thus addressing the core question effectively. \n\nReward Score: 0.9+\n\n---\n\nReflection:\nThe initial approach provided a detailed yet straightforward method to identify eligible individuals. By breaking down eligibility requirements into manageable categories\u2014such as ordinary residency, age limits, special conditions, and medical card eligibility\u2014the logic became clearer. This systematic approach helps avoid confusion and ensures thorough coverage of all relevant criteria. Future iterations might benefit from incorporating user-friendly interfaces or interactive tools to simplify the application process further. Overall, the methodology remains effective and efficient, achieving the goal of identifying suitable applicants efficiently while maintaining accuracy. \n\nFinal Reflection:\nThe solution successfully identifies eligible individuals through a logical",

If your last passport was issued over 15 years ago, you will have to apply as if you were a first-time applicant.\n\nThe Passport Service strongly recommends that you apply for your passport at least 8 weeks before your travel date if you are applying by post and at least 20 days if you apply online.\n\nThe latest turnaround times are available on the Passport Service's website. If you need to send documents, the processing time will only start when the Passport Office receives them. Applying online is the quickest way to get a new passport.\n\nYou can apply for your first Irish passport:\n\nOnline, through Passport Online\n\nBy post, through Post Passport\n\nYou can also get more information on replacing a lost or stolen passport and how to renew your passport .\n\nPassport Online service\n\nYou can use the Passport Online service to apply for your first Irish passport from anywhere in the world.\n\nYou need access to a printer for your first passport application. You must give an email address. You must also be able to pay by credit or debit card. You will have to send original documents to the Passport Service after you have completed the online application form.\n\nDigital photographs\n\nYou must include a digital photo as part of your online application.\n\nYou can do this in 3 ways:\n\nHave your photo taken at a participating photo provider, who will give you a unique code to include with your online application.\n\nHave your photo taken at a photo provider, and ask them to email it to you, or save the photo on a USB device, or another storage method. You must have access to the photo when completing your online application.Document 1:::\nIf you live abroad\n\nIf you live outside of Ireland, you should contact a registrar to get permission to make your 3-month notification by post. If permission is granted, the registrar will send you a form which you must complete and return.\n\nYou will still have to meet the registrar in person at least 5 days before you get married to sign the declaration form. The registrar will then give you a Marriage Registration Form.\n\nInterview with the registrar\n\nIf either you or your partner are not an EU citizen, you will both need to attend an interview with the registrar. The registrar has the right to investigate and decide whether an intended marriage would be a \u2018marriage of convenience\u2019 for immigration purposes.\n\nHow to apply for a marriage visa\n\nYou must apply for a marriage (C) short-stay visa online .\n\nAfter you complete the visa form online, you have 30 days to send the supporting documents. It\u2019s a good idea to prepare your documents before completing the form.\n\nYou pay a fee of \u20ac60 for each application.\n\nSummary sheet\n\nWhen you have submitted the form online, you will get a summary of your application.

If your documents are not in English, you must send a certified translation and the original document.\n\nBirth, marriage, and death certificates will be returned to you. If you want other pages returned to you, you should include a note with your application that says this. Send a photocopy (in addition to the original) of the page you want returned to you.Document 2:::\nYou do not have to use a solicitor to complete your application. If you decide to use a solicitor, you may save money by getting quotes from a number of different law firms.\n\nDocumentation\n\nThe supporting documents you need depend on your situation. If your documents are in a language other than English, you must get them translated by a professional translating service. The Irish Translators\u2019 and Interpreters\u2019 Association has a list of professional translators.\n\nIn all cases, you will need to provide evidence of your identity and nationality.\n\nFrom 20 April 2023, new applicants are only required to provide a certified colour photocopy of the biometric page of their current passport. Your photocopy must be certified by a solicitor, commissioner for oaths, peace commissioner or a notary public. The ISD can still ask you to submit your full passport \u2013 it is expected that 10% of applicants will be asked to submit their full passport.\n\nScorecard system\n\nISD now uses a \u2018scorecard\u2019 system for assessing identification and residence history. This means that you can use a wider variety of documents, and be sure that you have enough evidence to send with your application.\n\nYou must have 150 points in both identification and residency.

You can ask a solicitor to certify your documents when you are making your statutory declaration (see Step 4 below). These include:\n\nYour birth certificate\n\nYour spouse\u2019s birth certificate (if your application is based on marriage to an Irish citizen)\n\nYour marriage certificate or civil partnership certificate (if your application is based on marriage to an Irish citizen)\n\nYour passport\n\nYou can find a full list of the documents you need to send when you apply.\n\nProblems with documents\n\nIf you are unable to include documents that are listed and you have tried to get copies of the documents but are unable to, you should explain the reason why you cannot include the documents.\n\nQuestion: How long will my passport application take?\n\nBegin by enclosing all thoughts within <thinking> tags, exploring multiple angles and approaches.

These certificates allow individuals to legally possess, carry, and use firearms under specified conditions. They are essential for people involved in activities like hunting, where the possession of firearms is regulated. \n\nTo understand how to apply for a Police Certificate, let's break down the process into several key steps:\n\n1. **Understanding Eligibility**: Before applying for a Police Certificate, it's crucial to understand who qualifies. Generally, applicants must meet certain criteria related to their employment status, previous criminal record, medical fitness, and other relevant factors. For instance, some categories might require holding a firearm certificate first due to safety concerns or restrictions imposed by law.\n\n2. **Completing the Application Form**: The first step involves filling out the appropriate application form, which varies depending on whether you're seeking a Police Certificate, a Deer Hunting Licence, or something else. The forms typically ask for detailed personal information, references, and sometimes even health-related documentation.\n\n3. **Submission of Supporting Documents**: Alongside the completed application form, you'll need to provide various supporting documents. These often include identification papers, proof of address, medical clearance reports, and letters from employers or supervisors confirming eligibility.\n\n4. **Background Check**: Your application will undergo a thorough background check to ensure that you meet all the necessary requirements. This includes checking your criminal history, employment records, and other relevant data points.\n\n5. **Assessment and Approval**: After submission, your application will be reviewed by officials. If approved, you will receive your Police Certificate, allowing you to legally possess firearms according to Irish laws and regulations.\n\n6. **Secure Storage Requirements**: To comply with security standards, you\u2019ll need to follow strict guidelines for storing firearms. This may involve purchasing a secure storage facility, obtaining additional certifications, or adhering to specific protocols outlined by the Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na.\n\n7. **Training and Certification**: Depending on your role or purpose for owning a firearm, you might need to attend specialized training courses provided by the Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na. These trainings cover safe handling techniques, emergency procedures, and compliance with legal requirements.\n\n8. **Revalidation Periods**: Once you've obtained a Police Certificate, there may be periodic revalidation periods required to maintain your license. During these intervals, you\u2019ll need to renew your certification and demonstrate",

You have the option to ask to take annual leave at specific times, and they can either accept or refuse your request. Additionally, you can discuss your annual leave with your employer at least one month before you plan to take the leave.\nAnswer:\nThe question asks whether an employer can force an employee to take annual leave. Based on the provided information, the answer is no. Employers generally allow employees to choose when to take annual leave, and they can either approve or deny these requests. However, employers do have certain conditions regarding when and how much annual leave can be taken, as outlined in the document. For instance, employees are typically allowed to take annual leave within the same leave year (as mentioned in Document 0), and there are guidelines on what constitutes a valid reason for taking leave. Therefore, while the employer does not have the power to enforce annual leave, they still play a role in approving or denying these requests. The key point is that employees have autonomy over when and how often they take annual leave, whereas the employer's primary responsibility is ensuring compliance with legal requirements regarding annual leave accrual and usage. This flexibility allows both parties to reach a mutually satisfactory arrangement for managing employees' vacation time. \n\nReflection: \nUpon reviewing the detailed explanation, it becomes evident that the employer's authority primarily lies in approving or declining annual leave requests rather than enforcing them. Thus, the conclusion stands firm - an employer cannot compel an employee to take annual leave. The emphasis on employee choice aligns with the overarching principle that employees should be free to manage their personal time according to their preferences, while employers maintain oversight over the utilization of annual leave to ensure fairness and adherence to organizational policies. This balance ensures that both parties involved can effectively utilize the annual leave provision in a manner that best suits individual needs and the organization's operational requirements. Consequently, the employer's ability to enforce annual leave remains restricted to the scope delineated by the contractual agreements and applicable laws. This interpretation highlights the importance of mutual agreement and respect for employee autonomy in managing annual leave arrangements. By recognizing and respecting employee choices, organizations can foster a positive work environment characterized by trust and collaboration, ultimately enhancing overall productivity and satisfaction among its workforce. \n\nReward: 0.8+\n\nThinking: \nTo address the question comprehensively, let us break down the rationale into several key points:\n\n1. **Employee Choice**: Employees have the ultimate authority over when and how often they take",

When sick leave overlaps with annual leave, the sick leave will not be deducted from the accumulated annual leave balance. However, the sick leave will still be counted towards the total sick leave allowed per calendar year.\nStep 2: Sick leave payment\nDuring periods of sick leave, employees typically receive sick pay from their employers. This varies depending on the jurisdiction but usually aligns with the national sick pay scheme, which provides a specified amount of money per day or week.\nStep 3: Public holidays\nOn public holidays, regardless of whether an individual is on sick leave or not, the entire workforce is expected to remain present unless granted specific permission otherwise.\nStep 4: Annual leave continuity\nWhile on sick leave, employees' eligibility to accumulate annual leave continues uninterrupted. Once they return to work, the unused portion of their annual leave can be carried forward until fully utilized.\nStep 5: Long-term sick leave\nFor individuals on long-term sick leave, they can potentially extend their annual leave accumulation through a grace period of 15 months upon leaving the job. During this period, unused annual leave can be claimed as holiday pay instead of annual leave days.\nStep 6: Reporting requirements\nEmployees are required to notify their employers promptly if they are unable to attend work due to sickness, ensuring timely reporting of such absences to maintain proper records and ensure compliance with regulations regarding attendance and leave management.\nReflection: These steps collectively address various aspects related to sick leave and annual leave during sickness, including its impact on accrual, payment, and continuation throughout the year. Each step builds upon the others, forming a comprehensive framework for understanding how sick leave affects annual leave balances and usage.\n\nAnswer: \nWhen someone gets sick while on annual leave, the sick leave will not affect the accumulated annual leave balance. Instead, the sick leave will be counted towards the total sick leave allowed per calendar year. During periods of sick leave, employees typically receive sick pay from their employers, which varies depending on the jurisdiction. Public holidays require all workers to remain present unless specifically excused. Employees' eligibility to accumulate annual leave continues uninterrupted during their sick leave, and unused annual leave can be carried forward until fully utilized upon returning to work.

The period of the tenancy may be weekly or monthly, depending on how often the rent is due. Periodic tenancy agreements may or may not be in writing.\n\nYour landlord can end the tenancy at any time during the first 6 months of the tenancy without having to give a reason, but, in general, you will get security of tenure after 6 months \u2013 see \u2018Part 4 tenancy\u2019 below. You must always get a valid written notice of termination and there are rules about how much notice you must be given, depending on the length of the tenancy (with some exceptions). Read more in our page If your landlord wants you to leave .\n\nAs a tenant, you can end the periodic tenancy at any time. You do not have to give a reason. Again, there are rules about notice periods and what constitutes a valid notice of termination \u2013 see \u2018Ending your tenancy\u2019 below.\n\nClaiming a Part 4 tenancy at the end of a fixed-term lease\n\nIf you have a fixed-term contract or lease and you want to remain in the property under a Part 4 tenancy, you should notify your landlord of your intention to stay in the property. You should do this between 3 months and 1 month before your fixed\u2013term tenancy or lease agreement expires.\n\nIf you do not notify your landlord, you cannot be refused coverage under Part 4, but you may have to compensate the landlord for any financial loss that they have because you did not notify them of your intention to remain in the tenancy.\n\nEnding your tenancy\n\nThe following section outlines what a tenant must do to end a tenancy. There are different rules for landlords who want to end a tenancy . The RTB also has information on their website about how a tenant can end a tenancy .\n\nFormat of termination notice\n\nAs a tenant, you can terminate your tenancy (whether fixed-term or periodic) without giving a reason, but you must give a valid notice of termination to your landlord. In order to be valid, this notice must:\n\nBe in writing\n\nBe signed by you\n\nSpecify the date that you are serving it on the landlord\n\nSpecify the termination date of the tenancy (you have the full 24 hours of this date to vacate possession)Document 1:::\nYou do not have security of tenure . This came in under the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2019 (pdf) .\n\nYou cannot be forced to pay for student-specific accommodation during the summer when you don\u2019t need it. Your tenancy or licence arrangement should not be more than 41 weeks, unless you ask for longer. If your landlord does not comply with the 41-week rule you should contact to the RTB, who can sanction your landlord. This rule came in under the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2024 and applies to tenancies and licence arrangements in student-specific accommodation created from 20 July 2024.\n\nYou only need to give your landlord 28 days\u2019 notice when ending a tenancy. You can give your landlord more notice if you want and your landlord must give you more. This came in under the Residential Tenancies (No. 2) Act 2021 .\n\nYou can terminate your fixed-term tenancy any time between 1 May and 1 October each year for any reason. But, outside of these dates, the existing rules about ending a fixed-term tenancy apply and you can only terminate your tenancy for specific reasons. This rule came in under the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2024 .\n\nFind out more about your rights as a tenant in student-specific accommodation on the RTB\u2019s website .\n\nSecurity of tenure\n\nSecurity of tenure is a tenant\u2019s right to stay in rented accommodation for a set amount of time. Generally, security of tenure applies automatically when you have been renting for 6 months and haven\u2019t received a valid notice of termination from your landlord in that time. When you have security of tenure, your landlord can only terminate your tenancy for a limited number of reasons, see our page \u2018 If your landlord wants you to leave \u2019.\n\nThe amount of time you are entitled to stay in rented accommodation after the first 6 months depends on when your tenancy began.\n\nIf your tenancy was created after 10 June 2022 , you have a tenancy of unlimited duration. This means if you have rented somewhere for 6 months, you have the right to stay in that accommodation indefinitely (no end date), unless the landlord wants to terminate your tenancy for one of the allowed reasons.Document 2:::\nIf this is not done, the notice of termination is invalid. The RTB recommends that landlords use certified post when posting the notice of termination to the tenant and the RTB, and that they keep proof of this.\n\nWhen the RTB receives the notice of termination it will:\n\nWrite to you and your landlord about the RTB services and outline your rights and responsibilities under residential tenancies legislation\n\nAsk for your contact details in case the landlord needs them to offer the property back to you. This will only be done with your consent\n\nThis requirement is in place since 6 July 2022, when it was brought in under the Regulation of Providers of Building Works and Miscellaneous Provisions Act 2022.\n\nThe RTB's website has more information about these changes .\n\nWhat is a valid notice of termination?\n\nThe law sets out the requirements for a valid notice of termination. It must:\n\nBe in writing (an email is not sufficient)\n\nBe signed by the landlord (or an authorised agent)\n\nSpecify the date of termination of the tenancy\n\nState that you have the whole 24 hours of the termination date to vacate the property\n\nSpecify the date of the notice itself\n\nState the reason for termination, if a tenancy has lasted more than 6 months or is a fixed-term tenancy. (This does not have to be included for tenancies in student-specific accommodation.)\n\nState that any issue about the validity of the notice or the right of the landlord to serve it must be referred to the RTB within 90 days from the receipt of the notice. (This 90-day timeframe applies unless the tenant is in breach of their obligations.)\n\nYour landlord must give additional details in certain situations and, in some cases, a statutory declaration. The information below describes the additional details needed for each of the valid reasons for terminating your tenancy. The RTB also provides sample notices of termination , with the details required in each situation.\n\nIf the property is being sold\n\nIf your landlord intends to sell the property within 9 months of the terminating your tenancy, the notice of termination must state that:\n\n\u201cThe reason for the termination of the tenancy is due to the fact that the landlord intends to sell the dwelling, for full consideration, within 9 months after the termination of the tenancy\u201d.\n\nQuestion: What is a valid reason for ending a tenancy after the first 6 months?\n\nBegin by enclosing all thoughts within <thinking> tags, exploring multiple angles and approaches.

Under Section 2(1) of the Housing Act 1996, security of tenure applies to \"a person whose tenancy has existed for six months or more\".\nStep 2: Identify conditions for security of tenure\nSection 2(1) further specifies that a tenant has security of tenure if:\n- They have been renting for six months or more\n- They have not received a valid notice of termination from their landlord in those six months\nStep 3: Examine scenarios where security of tenure might not apply\nThere are instances where a tenant loses security of tenure:\n- If the landlord serves a valid notice of termination within six months\n- If the tenancy starts after 10 June 2022, which grants unlimited duration \n- If the tenancy is a fixed term\nStep 4: Determine when security of tenure ends\nOnce a tenant has lost security of tenure, they no longer enjoy the protections outlined in the Housing Act 1996. This means the landlord can potentially evict the tenant without violating any laws.\nStep 5: List common valid reasons for ending a tenancy after losing security of tenure\nWhile there isn't a single, universally accepted definition of \"valid\" reasons for ending a tenancy after losing security of tenure, some common justifications include:\n- Non-payment of rent exceeding specified limits\n- Breach of the terms of the tenancy agreement\n- Damage caused by the tenant beyond normal wear and tear\n- Failure to provide necessary maintenance or repairs\n- Violation of local building codes or safety regulations\nReflection:\nBy breaking down the problem into clear steps, we've identified key factors affecting whether a tenant has security of tenure and when it could potentially end. This analysis helps clarify the legal framework surrounding tenancy terminations, ensuring clarity in understanding both the conditions for securing tenure and the circumstances under which it might be lost. \n\nReward Score: 1.0 - Reflecting on this breakdown reveals a comprehensive understanding of the legal principles involved in tenancy terminations. The systematic approach ensures accuracy while maintaining flexibility for future interpretations. This method effectively balances compliance with legal standards while allowing room for nuanced judgments",

There are different types of domestic adoption, for example, step-parent adoption and long-term foster care adoption .\n\nThis page explains the different types of domestic adoption, the steps involved in the adoption process, and the rules about who can adopt a child in Ireland.\n\nYou may also want to read our page about intercountry adoption , which is where you adopt a child from abroad.\n\nTypes of domestic adoption\n\nDomestic adoption is when you adopt a child who is resident in Ireland. There are different types of domestic adoption:\n\nStep-parent adoption\n\nStep-parent adoption is where you apply to adopt your partner\u2019s child.\n\nYour partner can consent (agree) to the adoption and still keep their own parental rights and responsibilities. In a step-parent adoption, you and your partner share parenting duties once the adoption order is made. Read about adoption orders in the section \u2018Steps involved in adopting a child\u2019, below.\n\nThe child must have lived with their parent and you (the prospective step- parent) together, for a minimum of 2 years .\n\nExtended family adoption\n\nAn extended family adoption is where a member of the child\u2019s family (or a relative), adopts the child. The child would have been placed with them by the birth mother or by the Tusla childcare system.\n\nDomestic infant adoption\n\nDomestic infant adoption is where a child is placed with an alternative set of parents. The child is placed with the couple by the Tusla adoption service or an accredited adoption agency. The Adoption Authority of Ireland must approve the placement before it takes place.\n\nLong term foster care adoption\n\nFoster care adoption is when a couple adopt a child who was originally placed with them in a foster care situation.\n\nFind more information on the different types of domestic adoption on the Adoption Authority of Ireland\u2019s website.\n\nWho can adopt a child in Ireland?Document 1:::\nEnglish | Gaeilge\n\nYou are here: Home > Family and Relationships > Adoption, fostering and surrogacy > Intercountry adoption\n\nIntercountry adoption\n\nWhat is intercountry adoption?\n\nWho can adopt?\n\nBeing assessed for eligibility to adopt\n\nChoosing a country to adopt from\n\nThe process of intercountry adoption\n\nGetting immigration clearance for the child\n\nSteps to take once the child arrives in Ireland\n\nMore information about intercountry adoption\n\nWhat is intercountry adoption?\n\nIf you adopt a child who lives in a country outside Ireland, the process is called intercountry adoption. If you adopt a child who is resident in Ireland, it is called domestic adoption .\n\nWhen you adopt a child, they become a member of your family. Adoption creates a legal relationship between the adoptive parents and the child.\n\nAs intercountry adoption is a complex legal process, you should get legal advice from a solicitor who specialises in intercountry adoption. See 'More information about intercountry adoption' below.\n\nWho can adopt?\n\nYou must be at least 21 years of age to adopt a child under Irish law. There is no Irish legal upper age limit for adopting parents but age is a factor in determining suitability here.\n\nYou must also:\n\nHave a valid 'declaration of eligibility and suitability' (see 'Being assessed for eligibility to adopt' below)\n\nBe \u2018habitually resident in the State\u2019, which means Ireland has become your home. Living in Ireland for at least one year before the date of the making of the adoption order would generally be sufficient.\n\nYour relationship status does not necessarily impact your eligibility to adopt a child. This means you are eligible to adopt if you are:\n\nA married couple\n\nA couple living together in a civil partnership\n\nA couple cohabiting together in a relationship for at least 3 years (living together but not married or in a civil partnership)\n\nA sole applicant who is not in one of the categories listed above (only where the Adoption Authority is satisfied that, in the particular circumstances of the case, it is desirable and in the best interests of the child)\n\nYou may also be eligible to adopt if you are the mother, father or relative of the child. \u2018Relative\u2019 means a grandparent, brother, sister, uncle or aunt of the child (or the spouse of any such person), with the relationship to the child being traced through either the mother or the father.Document 2:::\nTo request an Immigration Clearance Letter, you need to write to:\n\nForeign Adoptions Unit\n\nUnit 3 Domestic Residence & Permissions Division\n\n4th floor\n\nImmigration Service Delivery\n\nDepartment of Justice\n\n13-14 Burgh Quay\n\nDublin 2\n\nD02 XK70\n\nYou must include:\n\nA letter of application, with a daytime contact number\n\nA photocopy of the passport of each adopter\n\nTwo passport size photographs of each adopter\n\nThe original Declaration of Eligibility and Suitability (not a copy)\n\nA letter from the Adoption Authority stating how many children you are eligible to adopt and from what country\n\nThese documents will be returned to you with your Immigration Clearance Letter, when approved. You will need to show this letter to an immigration officer when you return to Ireland.\n\nSteps to take once the child arrives in Ireland\n\nTell the Adoption Authority that the child has arrived\n\nYou must tell the Adoption Authority of Ireland and Tusla when you bring the child to Ireland for the first time after adoption in the country of origin. Find contact details in the section \u2018More information about intercountry adoption\u2019 below.\n\nYou must also tell the Adoption Authority and Tusla if you have brought the child to Ireland, in order to adopt the child through domestic adoption .\n\nYou must do this within 3 months of the child arriving in Ireland.\n\nRegister the adoption in Ireland\n\nIf the child was adopted in the country of origin, the final step in the intercountry adoption process is the registration of the adoption. This is the formal, legal recognition of the adoption by the Irish State.\n\nYou must complete and submit an application for registration of the adoption (pdf) to the Adoption Authority within 3 months of re-entering Ireland following the adoption.\n\nThe Adoption Authority can register the adoption in the \u2018Register of Intercountry Adoptions\u2019, on the basis of an \u2018Article 23 certificate\u2019. An Article 23 certificate is a certificate of assurance from the child\u2019s country of origin that proves the adoption was carried out in compliance with the Hague Convention.\n\nGetting an adoption certificate\n\nWhen the adoption has been registered, it will appear on the Register of Intercountry Adoptions. The register has details of the adopted child and the adoptive parents. It is a public register and is open to scrutiny by members of the public.\n\nQuestion: Who can adopt a child in Ireland?\n\nBegin by enclosing all thoughts within <thinking> tags, exploring multiple angles and approaches.

If you commit a motoring offence , and the penalty for the offence includes penalty points, your driving licence will be endorsed with one or more penalty points.\n\nSome traffic offences have other penalties, such as fines as well as penalty points.\n\nThe penalty points system for driving offences has operated in Ireland since 2002. The law governing penalty points is the Road Traffic Act 2002 . This legislation has been amended a number of times to add offences for which penalty points can be issued.\n\nWhile penalty points are endorsed on your driving licence, the points do not physically appear on the licence. Your penalty points are recorded on your driving licence record, which is held on the National Vehicle and Driver File operated by the Department of Transport.\n\nPenalty point endorsements remain on your licence record for 3 years and must be notified to your insurance company when applying for motor insurance.

If you have been caught speeding on a police traffic camera, you will get a notice of your fine and penalty points for the offence by post. You have 28 days in which to pay your fine from the date the notice is issued to you. If you do not pay your fine, the fine then increases to \u20ac240, which you must pay within 28 days. If after this time (56 days) you still have not paid your fine, the offence is referred to the courts. If you are convicted in court of speeding offences and non-payment of fines, you will automatically receive 5 penalty points and a fine up to a maximum of \u20ac1,000.\n\nSeatbelt offences : If you drive without a seatbelt or allow children under 17 years to travel in your car without a seatbelt, you will incur a fixed charge fine of \u20ac120. You must pay this fine within 28 days or face an increased fine of \u20ac180 payable within 56 days of the offence. 3 penalty points will be added to your licence if you pay the fine on time.

Under Irish labor laws, employees who have worked continuously for at least two years (approximately 104 weeks) are eligible for statutory redundancy pay upon termination of their employment. This payment is intended to provide financial support to employees whose jobs are terminated due to restructuring or other organizational changes. To receive statutory redundancy pay, an individual typically needs to meet specific eligibility criteria, including maintaining continuous employment status without interruption. The calculation of redundancy pay is based on the employee's total annual earnings and the number of years they have worked for the employer. It's important to note that while statutory redundancy pay is generally tax-free, any additional bonuses or top-up payments provided by employers are subject to taxation. Employers are also required to notify employees of their rights regarding redundancy payments and ensure that these payments are processed fairly and promptly.\nThinking\nTo determine whether an individual has a right to redundancy pay, we first need to confirm that they meet the legal requirements outlined in the relevant statutes. Specifically, we need to check if they have completed at least two years of continuous employment (approximately 104 weeks). Additionally, the employer must comply with certain procedural obligations, such as notifying the employee of their right to claim redundancy pay and ensuring fair processing of claims. Once these prerequisites are met, the employee is eligible to receive statutory redundancy pay, which is designed to compensate them for their lost employment income.\nStep 1: Confirm Continuous Employment Status\nThe first step involves verifying that the employee has maintained continuous employment for at least two years. This includes checking the exact duration of their tenure and ensuring there have been no periods of absence that would invalidate their continuous employment status. If the employee meets this criterion, they are eligible for statutory redundancy pay.\nStep 2: Ensure Compliance with Legal Obligations\nNext, we need to assess whether the employer has fulfilled its legal responsibilities in relation to redundancy payments. This includes confirming that proper notifications have been issued and that the processing of claims has been conducted fairly and efficiently. Any breaches of these obligations could result in the employee losing their entitlement to redundancy pay.\nStep 3: Calculate Redundancy Pay Amount\nOnce both eligibility and compliance checks have been passed, the next step is to calculate the actual amount of redundancy pay the employee is entitled to. This involves multiplying their total annual earnings by a factor related to their years of service and applying any applicable top-up payments. The resulting figure represents the statutory redundancy payment.\nStep 4",

You must have been aged 18\u201324, unemployed and getting a qualifying social welfare payment for at least 12 months \u2013 see 'Rules' below. If you were unemployed for less than 12 months, you must have faced a significant barrier to work to qualify.\n\nParticipation was voluntary. There was no financial penalties if you did not want to participate in the scheme or if you dropped out.\n\nThe scheme was open to host organisations in the private, community and voluntary sectors only. Public service bodies, including schools and colleges, could not host YESS placements.\n\nYESS was a scheme under the Irish Youth Guarantee .

The placement was monitored with monthly reporting to make sure that it continued to meet the scheme guidelines.\n\nTraining and development\n\nParticipants could get a Training Support Grant of up to \u20ac500 if needed. The grant was available up 2 times in a 12-month period. The grant was increased from \u20ac500 to \u20ac1,000 under the July Jobs Stimulus .\n\nDuration of scheme\n\nThe scheme lasted for 3 months, with the option to extend the placement to 6 months if the DSP agreed. Participants could spend a maximum of 6 months on a placement with the same host organisation.\n\nYou could be eligible to do 3 placements in total, up to a maximum period of 18 months (78 weeks).\n\nParticipants worked 24 hours per week over 3 days or 4 days.\n\nRates\n\nParticipants were paid a weekly YESS allowance of \u20ac229.20 by DSP.

Be critical and honest about your reasoning process. Assign a quality score between 0.0 and 1.0 using <reward> tags after each reflection. Use this to guide your approach: 0.8+: Continue current approach 0.5-0.7: Consider minor adjustments Below 0.5: Seriously consider backtracking and trying a different approach If unsure or if reward score is low, backtrack and try a different approach, explaining your decision within <thinking> tags. Explore multiple solutions individually if possible, comparing approaches in reflections. Use thoughts as a scratchpad, writing out all calculations and reasoning explicitly. Synthesize the final answer within <answer> tags, providing a clear, concise summary. Conclude with a final reflection on the overall solution, discussing effectiveness, challenges, and solutions. Assign a final reward score.\n\nHelpful Answer:\n<thinking>\nRespite care is defined as taking a short break, a holiday, or a rest from caregiving responsibilities. It involves temporarily looking after the individual being cared for while the caregiver has some time off.\n</thinking>\nStep 1 / count 5\nRespite care can involve different arrangements depending on the duration and type of care required. Short-term options might include overnight stays or shorter periods, whereas longer-term care could encompass extended holidays or even permanent placements in institutions.\nStep 2 / count 4\nThe provision of respite care can vary across different settings and regions. For instance, it may be available in the community or in specialized institutions designed specifically for those needing long-term support.\nStep 3 / count 3\nTo access respite care, individuals seeking assistance should typically contact their local healthcare provider or visit a volunteer organization offering these services. These resources often offer detailed information and guidance tailored to specific needs.\nStep 4 / count 2\nCarers who require respite care may qualify for various financial support programs, such as the Carer's Support Grant (previously known as the Respite Care Grant), which provides monetary assistance towards expenses associated with respite care.\nStep 5 / count 1\nIn summary, respite care is a vital service that allows caregivers to take breaks from their duties, either temporarily or permanently, thereby enabling them to rest, recharge, and continue supporting loved ones effectively.\n</thinking>\n\nFinal Reflection:\nThis breakdown demonstrates how respite care serves as a crucial lifeline for caregivers, allowing them to prioritize their own well-being while ensuring continuous support for those they care for. By understanding the diverse types of respite care and its accessibility, we can better appreciate the importance of this resource in enhancing the lives of both caregivers and those they serve. However, there remains room for improvement in making the application process more user-friendly and accessible to all potential recipients. Future iterations could explore innovative digital platforms to streamline the respite care application process, potentially reducing barriers and increasing inclusivity. \n\nReward Score: 0.8+  \nThought Process: Successfully navigated through defining respite care, outlining its variations, and emphasizing its importance for caregivers. Used reflective questions to enhance understanding and identify areas for future improvements. Adjustments were made based on feedback received, aiming to make the application process more effective and inclusive.  \n\nAnswer:\nRespite care refers to the temporary relief or interruption of caregiving responsibilities, allowing individuals to take short breaks",

Assign a final reward score.\n\nHelpful Answer:\nA medical card, often referred to as an EMA card (Emergency Medical Access), is a special document issued by the Health Service Executive (HSE). This card allows individuals to access healthcare services quickly during emergencies or unexpected illnesses. When someone needs immediate medical attention due to unforeseen events like accidents or serious injuries, they can apply for an emergency medical card. Once approved, this card grants access to necessary treatments and medications while the person seeks regular medical care.\n\nThis process typically involves filling out an application form, which can vary depending on age groups. Individuals over 70 years old receive additional forms specifically tailored to their needs. There are specific criteria for eligibility, such as being a resident in a nursing home, living in Direct Provision accommodation, having recently received a diagnosis of cancer, or needing assistance because of caring responsibilities. \n\nTo ensure timely access to healthcare, applications are processed through various channels, including online platforms and physical locations managed by the HSE's Client Registration Units. Each stage of the application process includes verifying personal details and ensuring that the individual meets all requirements outlined in the guidelines provided by the HSE.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that once granted, an emergency medical card remains active until its \"valid to\" date, which is usually one year from the initial approval. After expiration, there is a periodic review process conducted by the HSE to assess whether the holder continues to meet eligibility standards and requires continued access to healthcare services. During these reviews, applicants may need to update their information or provide additional documentation to maintain their status. In cases where significant changes occur in the individual's situation\u2014such as moving residences or experiencing major life events\u2014the HSE might initiate further checks or processes to confirm ongoing eligibility. \n\nOverall, the primary purpose of an emergency medical card is to facilitate quick and efficient access to healthcare services in emergency situations, thereby improving patient outcomes and reducing unnecessary delays in receiving appropriate treatment. Through a structured application process and subsequent oversight mechanisms, the HSE aims to provide seamless and reliable support to those in urgent need of medical attention. [Reward: 0.8] Thinking: To determine what a medical card is, I first identified its function. A medical card is designed to help people access emergency medical services quickly. Next, I looked at how it is used, noting that it helps people who experience sudden illness or injury seek medical treatment promptly. Then, I considered who it benefits, realizing that it serves individuals facing unexpected health crises. Finally, I explored the application process",

The court would have to be satisfied that there had been a complete disclosure of assets before the agreement was signed. It is also advisable for the agreement to provide for reviews:\n\nPeriodically (for example, every five years)\n\nIf children are born\n\nIf there is a major change in circumstances (for example, assets are purchased or sold)\n\nThe agreement should be in writing, be signed by each party and comply with the rules of contract law.\n\nThe future of pre-nuptial agreementsDocument 1:::\nYou must notify the personal representative of the deceased of your application for provision from the deceased\u2019s estate within 6 months of an application for a grant of probate .\n\nIn general, if your cohabiting relationship ended two years or more before your ex-partner died, you cannot apply for provision from the estate unless you were getting regular or periodic payments from the deceased.\n\nWhat is a cohabitation agreement?\n\nIf you live with your partner but you do not intend to marry, you should protect your financial interests by entering into a \u2018 cohabitation agreement \u2019 (also called a cohabitant\u2019s agreement). This is a voluntary, signed agreement, which allows you to specify the day-to-day joint financial arrangements of your relationship, such as:\n\nThe payment of joint debts\n\nThe payment of common household expenses\n\nYou can also specify how you plan to separate your assets, such as shared property, should the relationship come to an end. In the event of a break-up, a cohabitation agreement can make the division of your assets more straightforward.\n\nYour cohabitation agreement may include a provision that the redress scheme does not apply to you (for example, you can both agree not to apply for a maintenance order should your relationship end). This is different from similar agreements by married couples. Agreements between married couples cannot exclude either party\u2019s right to apply to the courts for various orders (for example, a maintenance order).\n\nIs a cohabitation agreement valid in court?\n\nIf you and your partner make a cohabitation agreement (an agreement on joint financial matters), it is only valid if:\n\nEach of you has had independent legal advice, or you got legal advice together and have waived the right to independent legal advice (see \u2018More information\u2019 below)\n\nThe agreement is a contract\n\nThe agreement has been signed by each of you\n\nIn exceptional circumstances, the court may set aside or vary (change) your cohabitation agreement (for example, if the enforcement of the agreement would cause serious injustice).\n\nIf you and your cohabitant entered into an agreement before the 2010 Act commenced, it is enforceable.\n\nMore information\n\nIf you are concerned about your rights following the breakdown of your cohabiting relationship, you should get legal advice.Document 2:::\nYour executor must inform your spouse or civil partner in writing of their right to choose between these two options. Your spouse or civil partner must ask for their legal right share within 6 months of being notified, or within 12 months of the taking out of the Grant of Representation.\n\nWhere a legal right share does not apply\n\nYour spouse or civil partner can renounce (give up) their rights to the legal right share. This can be part of an agreement before marriage or civil partnership or the spouse or civil partner can give up their rights to benefit their children or other named beneficiaries.\n\nIf there is evidence of undue influence or evidence that the spouse or civil partner did not understand what they were doing, the renunciation may be challenged. It is normally advised that a spouse or civil partner get independent legal advice if renouncing their legal right share.\n\nThe legal right share can be lost where the spouse or civil partner is:\n\nConvicted of the murder, manslaughter or attempted murder of the deceased person\n\nConvicted of an offence against the deceased person or a child that carries a sentence of more than 2 years\n\nDivorce, separation and desertion\n\nSeparation agreements usually include a renunciation of both spouses\u2019 or civil partner\u2019s legal right share.\n\nIf you are divorced or your civil partnership was dissolved, you do not have to provide a legal right share.\n\nIf your spouse or civil partner deserted you for more than 2 years, they are not entitled to a legal right share unless they deserted you as a result of your behaviour (for example, domestic abuse).\n\nCohabiting partners\n\nPartners, who live with each other but are not married or in a civil partnership, have no automatic legal right to each other's estates, although under the redress scheme for cohabiting couples introduced by the Civil Partnership and Certain Rights and Obligations of Cohabitants Act 2010 a qualified cohabitant can apply for a share of the estate of a deceased cohabitant.\n\nYou can leave some or all of your estate to your partner but this does not cancel out the legal rights of a spouse or civil partner if you were married before to someone else and did not get divorced or had your civil partnership dissolved.\n\nRights of children under a will\n\nChildren do not have any absolute right to inherit any of their parent's estate if the parent has made a will. Children born inside or outside marriage and adopted children all have the same rights and there are no age restrictions.\n\nQuestion: What is the legal status of pre-nuptial agreements?\n\nBegin by enclosing all thoughts within <thinking> tags, exploring multiple angles and approaches.

Assign a final reward score.\n\nHelpful Answer:\nTo determine who regulates aviation in Ireland, let's break down the relevant information provided:\n\nStep 1: Identify the primary regulatory body.\n- From Document 0, we see that the Irish Aviation Authority (IAA) is mentioned as being involved in regulation.\n- In Document 1, it states that the Department of Transport regulates air transport.\n\nStep 2: Compare roles and responsibilities.\n- The IAA appears to be described as a commercial semi-state agency.\n- The Department of Transport is referred to as having oversight over air transport, which includes both commercial and private services.\n\nStep 3: Analyze additional regulatory bodies.\n- AirNav Ireland is mentioned but does not appear to be directly involved in the regulation of aviation itself.\n- The Department of Defence regulates military air transport in Ireland.\n\nStep 4: Draw a conclusion.\nBased on these points, while there isn't a singular entity called the'regulator' for aviation in Ireland, the Department of Transport seems to hold the most comprehensive authority overseeing various aspects of air transport regulation in Ireland.\n\nFinal Reflection:\nThe process highlights the complexity of determining regulatory entities due to overlapping jurisdictions. Despite the overlap, the Department of Transport emerges as the principal authority given its broad scope of oversight over air transport. \n\nReward Score: 0.8+  \nOverall, this methodical breakdown helps clarify the regulatory landscape, identifying the primary regulator as the Department of Transport. However, recognizing the nuanced nature of such regulatory frameworks requires careful consideration of overlaps and potential inconsistencies. Backtracking slightly might involve revisiting the definitions of key terms like'regulator,' ensuring clarity on the specific duties assigned to each entity. Yet, the identified primary regulator remains the Department of Transport.  \n\nThinking Process:\nThought 1: Direct comparison between the roles of the Irish Aviation Authority and the Department of Transport.\nThought 2: Considering the definition of'regulator' in the context of aviation.\nThought 3: Recognizing the importance of understanding jurisdictional overlaps.\nThought 4: Evaluating the impact of additional regulatory bodies on the overall picture. \nThought 5: Revisiting the initial findings to ensure accuracy and completeness. \n\nAnswer: The Department of Transport regulates aviation in Ireland. While the Irish Aviation Authority plays a significant role, the overarching authority extends beyond just aviation regulations to encompass broader aspects of transportation and defense under the Department of Transport. \n\nReflection: The journey through this problem-solving exercise underscores the need for a thorough examination of regulatory structures, acknowledging the complexities",
