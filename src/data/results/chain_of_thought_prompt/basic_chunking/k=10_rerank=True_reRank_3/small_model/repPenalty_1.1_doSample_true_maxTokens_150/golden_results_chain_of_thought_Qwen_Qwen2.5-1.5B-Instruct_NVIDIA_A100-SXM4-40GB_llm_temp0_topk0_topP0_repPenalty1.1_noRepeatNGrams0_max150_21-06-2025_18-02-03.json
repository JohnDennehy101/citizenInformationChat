This can be determined through several criteria:\n\n1. Legal residency: The person has obtained legal documentation such as a passport, driver's license, or other official identification that confirms their status as a resident.\n2. Physical presence: They spend most of their time physically present in that location.\n3. Financial ties: They maintain significant financial connections there, including bank accounts, insurance policies, property taxes, and utility bills.\n4. Social ties: There are strong social networks and community activities centered around that place.\n5.

This system helps manage patient finances while ensuring they have access to regular health maintenance and treatment.

This can be documented with court papers showing that the landlord has taken appropriate legal action against the tenant.\n2. **Health and Safety Concerns**: If the property does not meet health and safety standards, tenants have grounds to terminate the lease. Documentation of these concerns through inspections and reports can support the termination.\n3. **Improper Maintenance**: Landlords are obligated to maintain the property. If the property deteriorates beyond repair without timely repairs, it justifies ending the tenancy. Records documenting the deterioration",

The eligibility criteria were likely designed to support young people aged 16-24 years old who were unemployed or underemployed and had no other means of income. Here are the key points:\n\n1. Age requirement: Individuals must be aged between 16 and 24 years.\n2. Unemployment status: They should not have any employment.\n3.

This means that if you have a pre-nuptial agreement in place and you end up in court following the breakdown of your marriage, the judge is not bound by the terms of the pre-nuptial agreement. The only provision in Irish law is under sections 113 and 113A of the Succession Act 1965 (as amended) where a spouse or a civil partner can renounce his/her legal right share in a pre-nuptial agreement. Although they are not legally binding, there is nothing in Irish law which stops a couple planning to marry from having and signing a pre-nuptial agreement. Importantly, such agreements can serve as guides for the courts in judicial separation and divorce cases. If a pre-nuptial agreement makes \u2018proper provision\u2019 for each person it is more likely to be persuasive on the judge. Therefore, in situations where one party is likely to inherit a significant family farm or business, it will guide the judge in the divorce or judicial separation on what the parties\u2019 intentions were at the outset.",

Break down the solution into clear steps within <step> tags. Start with a 10-step budget, requesting more for complex problems if needed. Use <count> tags after each step to show the remaining budget. Stop when reaching 0. Continuously adjust your reasoning based on intermediate results and reflections, adapting your strategy as you progress. Regularly evaluate progress using <reflection> tags. Be critical and honest about your reasoning process. Assign a quality score between 0.0 and 1.0 using <reward> tags after each reflection. Use this to guide your approach: 0.8+: Continue current approach 0.5-0.7: Consider minor adjustments Below 0.5: Seriously consider backtracking and trying a different approach If unsure or if reward score is low, backtrack and try a different approach, explaining your decision within <thinking> tags. Explore multiple solutions individually if possible, comparing approaches in reflections. Use thoughts as a scratchpad, writing out all calculations and reasoning explicitly.
