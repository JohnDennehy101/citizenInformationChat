To answer this question, we need to understand the concept of redundancy in the context of employment. Redundancy typically occurs when an employer no longer requires employees to do the work they are employed to do, because of changes in the workplace.\n\nStep 1: Define redundancy (0/10)\nRedundancy is a situation where an employer has ceased, or intends to cease, to require an employee to work for them because:\n- The employer no longer requires the employee's job to be done by anyone; or\n- There is a surplus of employees for the work to be done.\n\nStep 2: Identify changes in the workplace (0/9)\nChanges in the workplace can lead to redundancy. These changes could be due to technological advancements, restructuring, or a decrease in business demand.\n\nStep ",

In most jurisdictions, a landlord can end a tenancy after the initial fixed term (usually 6 months) only if they have a valid reason. These reasons may include:\n\n1. Non-payment of rent\n2. Breach of the lease agreement\n3. Causing damage to the property\n4. Using the property for illegal activities\n5. Overcrowding the property\n6. Refusing to vacate after the lease term ends\n\n<step count=1 budget=10>\nLet's assume the tenant has breached the lease agreement. This could be due to various reasons such as excessive noise, pets not allowed, or subletting without permission.\n\n<step count=2 budget=9>\nTo confirm the breach, the landlord should have documented evidence. This could be emails, letters",

This means that if you have a pre-nuptial agreement in place and you end up in court following the breakdown of your marriage, the judge is not bound by the terms of the pre-nuptial agreement. The only provision in Irish law is under sections 113 and 113A of the Succession Act 1965 (as amended) where a spouse or a civil partner can renounce his/her legal right share in a pre-nuptial agreement. Although they are not legally binding, there is nothing in Irish law which stops a couple planning to marry from having and signing a pre-nuptial agreement. Importantly, such agreements can serve as guides for the courts in judicial separation and divorce cases. If a pre-nuptial agreement makes \u2018proper provision\u2019 for each person it is more likely to be persuasive on the judge. Therefore, in situations where one party is likely to inherit a significant family farm or business, it will guide the judge in the divorce or judicial separation on what the parties\u2019 intentions were at the outset.",

Research common law jurisdictions: In common law jurisdictions, pre-nuptial agreements are generally upheld if they are fair and reasonable at the time of the agreement and at the time of divorce.\n\n4.

Assign a final reward score.\n\nHelpful Answer:\n\n<thinking>\n1. Identify the Luas system (Tram-style light rail service in Dublin, Ireland).\n2. Determine the operating hours for the Luas.\n3. Determine the frequency of the Luas.\n4. Gather information about the Luas from reliable sources (official Luas website, timetables, etc.).\n5. Extract the operating hours from the gathered information.\n6. Extract the frequency information from the gathered information.\n7. Organize the information into a clear, concise answer.\n8. Verify the accuracy of the information.\n9. Refine the answer for clarity and conciseness.\n10. Present the final answer.\n</thinking>\n\n<step count=10>\n1.

Break down the solution into clear steps within <step> tags. Start with a 10-step budget, requesting more for complex problems if needed. Use <count> tags after each step to show the remaining budget. Stop when reaching 0. Continuously adjust your reasoning based on intermediate results and reflections, adapting your strategy as you progress. Regularly evaluate progress using <reflection> tags. Be critical and honest about your reasoning process. Assign a quality score between 0.0 and 1.0 using <reward> tags after each reflection. Use this to guide your approach: 0.8+: Continue current approach 0.5-0.7: Consider minor adjustments Below 0.5: Seriously consider backtracking and trying a different approach If unsure or if reward score is low, backtrack and try a different approach, explaining your decision within <thinking> tags. Explore multiple solutions individually if possible, comparing approaches in reflections. Use thoughts as a scratchpad, writing out all calculations and reasoning explicitly. Synthesize the final answer within <answer> tags, providing a clear, concise summary. Conclude with a final reflection on the overall solution, discussing effectiveness, challenges, and solutions.
