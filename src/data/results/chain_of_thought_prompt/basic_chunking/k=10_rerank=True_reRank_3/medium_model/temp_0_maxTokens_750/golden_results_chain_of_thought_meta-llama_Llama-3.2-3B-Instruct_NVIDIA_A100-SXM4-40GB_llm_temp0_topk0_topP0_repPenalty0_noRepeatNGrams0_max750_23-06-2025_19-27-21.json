According to this law, citizenship can be acquired through birth, descent, naturalization, or registration.\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown of who is entitled to Irish citizenship:\n\n<step>Step 1: Birth</step> (Remaining budget: 9/10)\nA person born in Ireland on or after January 1, 2005, is automatically entitled to Irish citizenship. This includes children born in Ireland to parents who are not Irish citizens.\n\n<reflection>Reward: 0.9</reflection>\nThis approach seems to be working well, as it covers the most common scenarios.\n\n<step>Step 2: Descent</step> (Remaining budget: 8.5/10)\nA person born outside of Ireland to parents who are Irish citizens is also entitled to Irish citizenship. This includes children born abroad to Irish parents.\n\n<reflection>Reward: 0.9</reflection>\nThis approach is consistent with the law, and it's clear that descent is a valid route to citizenship.\n\n<step>Step 3: Naturalization</step> (Remaining budget: 7.5/10)\nA person who has been a resident in Ireland for at least 5 years (or 3 years if married to an Irish citizen) and meets certain requirements can apply for Irish citizenship through naturalization.\n\n<reflection>Reward: 0.9</reflection>\nThis approach is also consistent with the law, and it's a common route to citizenship for those who don't meet the birth or descent criteria.\n\n<step>Step 4: Registration</step> (Remaining budget: 6.5/10)\nA person who was born outside of Ireland to parents who were Irish citizens but did not acquire Irish citizenship themselves can apply for registration as an Irish citizen.\n\n<reflection>Reward: 0.9</reflection>\nThis approach is also consistent with the law, and it provides an additional route to citizenship for those who don't meet the other criteria.\n\n<step>Step 5: Marriage to an Irish citizen</step> (Remaining budget: 5.5/10)\nA person who marries an Irish citizen can acquire Irish citizenship through their spouse.\n\n<reflection>Reward: 0.9</reflection>\nThis approach is consistent with the law, and it's a common route to citizenship for those who don't meet the other criteria.\n\n<step>Step 6: Adoption</step> (Remaining budget: 4.5/10)\nA person who is adopted by an Irish citizen can acquire Irish citizenship through their adoptive parent.\n\n<reflection>Reward: 0.9</reflection>\nThis approach is consistent with the law, and it provides an additional route to citizenship for those who don't meet the other criteria.\n\n<step>Step 7: Humanitarian reasons</step> (Remaining budget: 3.5/10)\nA person who has been granted humanitarian protection in Ireland can acquire Irish citizenship through humanitarian reasons.\n\n<reflection>Reward: 0.9</reflection>\nThis approach is consistent with the law, and it provides an additional route to citizenship for those who don't meet the other criteria.\n\n<step>Step 8: Military service</step> (Remaining budget: 2.5/10)\nA person who has served in the Irish Defence Forces can acquire Irish citizenship through military service.\n\n<reflection>Reward: 0.9</reflection>\nThis approach is consistent with the law, and it provides an additional route to citizenship for those who don't meet the other criteria.\n\n<step>Step 9: Other exceptions</step> (Remaining budget",

This will help you understand your rights and obligations as an employee.\n2.  **Review your employment contract**: Check your employment contract to see if it includes any provisions related to annual leave. This may specify the amount of leave you are entitled to, the frequency of leave, or any conditions that must be met before leave can be taken.\n3.  **Consider your company's policies**: Familiarize yourself with your company's policies on annual leave. This may include any procedures for requesting leave, the types of leave that are available, and any restrictions on leave.\n4.  **Assess your employer's obligations**: Determine if your employer is required to provide you with annual leave under the relevant laws and regulations. This may include a minimum amount of leave per year or a specific type of leave.\n5.  **Evaluate your personal circumstances**: Consider your personal circumstances and whether you need to take annual leave. This may include factors such as your health, family responsibilities, or other personal commitments.\n6.  **Request leave if necessary**: If you need to take annual leave, request it from your employer in accordance with your company's policies and the relevant laws and regulations.\n7.  **Negotiate with your employer**: If your employer is unwilling to grant you the leave you need, consider negotiating with them. This may involve discussing alternative arrangements or finding a compromise.\n8.  **Seek support if necessary**: If you are unable to resolve the issue with your employer, consider seeking support from a trade union, HR representative, or other relevant authority.\n9.  **Consider alternative options**: If you are unable to take annual leave, consider alternative options such as taking unpaid leave, working remotely, or adjusting your work schedule.\n10. **Review and adjust**: Regularly review your leave arrangements and adjust them as needed to ensure they meet your personal and professional needs.\n\nReward score: 0.9\n\nThis approach provides a clear and structured framework for understanding your rights and obligations regarding annual leave. By following these steps, you can ensure that you are taking the necessary steps to protect your interests and meet your needs.\n\nFinal reflection: This approach is effective in providing a comprehensive understanding of the laws and regulations surrounding annual leave. However, it may be challenging to navigate complex employment contracts and company policies. To improve this approach, consider seeking support from a trade union or HR representative, and be prepared to negotiate with your employer. Additionally, regularly review and adjust your leave arrangements to ensure they meet your changing needs. Overall, this approach provides a solid foundation for understanding and managing annual leave, and with some adjustments, it can be even more effective.",

            "ground_truth": "Pre-nuptial agreements have no basis in law in Ireland. As a result, they are not strictly binding. This means that if you have a pre-nuptial agreement in place and you end up in court following the breakdown of your marriage, the judge is not bound by the terms of the pre-nuptial agreement. The only provision in Irish law is under sections 113 and 113A of the Succession Act 1965 (as amended) where a spouse or a civil partner can renounce his/her legal right share in a pre-nuptial agreement. Although they are not legally binding, there is nothing in Irish law which stops a couple planning to marry from having and signing a pre-nuptial agreement. Importantly, such agreements can serve as guides for the courts in judicial separation and divorce cases. If a pre-nuptial agreement makes \u2018proper provision\u2019 for each person it is more likely to be persuasive on the judge. Therefore, in situations where one party is likely to inherit a significant family farm or business, it will guide the judge in the divorce or judicial separation on what the parties\u2019 intentions were at the outset.",
