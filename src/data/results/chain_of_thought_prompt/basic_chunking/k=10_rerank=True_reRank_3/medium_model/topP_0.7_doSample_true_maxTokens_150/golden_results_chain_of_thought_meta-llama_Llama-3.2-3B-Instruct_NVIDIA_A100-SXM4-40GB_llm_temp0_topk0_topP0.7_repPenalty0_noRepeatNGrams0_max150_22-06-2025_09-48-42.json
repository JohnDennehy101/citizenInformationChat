This means that if you have a pre-nuptial agreement in place and you end up in court following the breakdown of your marriage, the judge is not bound by the terms of the pre-nuptial agreement. The only provision in Irish law is under sections 113 and 113A of the Succession Act 1965 (as amended) where a spouse or a civil partner can renounce his/her legal right share in a pre-nuptial agreement. Although they are not legally binding, there is nothing in Irish law which stops a couple planning to marry from having and signing a pre-nuptial agreement. Importantly, such agreements can serve as guides for the courts in judicial separation and divorce cases. If a pre-nuptial agreement makes \u2018proper provision\u2019 for each person it is more likely to be persuasive on the judge. Therefore, in situations where one party is likely to inherit a significant family farm or business, it will guide the judge in the divorce or judicial separation on what the parties\u2019 intentions were at the outset.",

In some countries, such as the United States, pre-nuptial agreements are recognized as valid contracts, while in others, they may not be enforceable. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the legal status of pre-nuptial agreements:\n\n1. **Check the jurisdiction**: The first step is to determine the legal status of pre-nuptial agreements in the specific country or state where the couple plans to get married. This will help you understand the applicable laws and regulations.\n\n2. **Review the laws**: Research the laws and regulations regarding pre-nuptial agreements in your jurisdiction.

The frequency of the Luas varies depending on the line and time of day, but generally, it runs every 5-10 minutes during peak hours and every 15-30 minutes during off-peak hours.\n\n<step> Step 1: Research the Luas operating hours.\n<count> 9/10\n\n<reflection> Reward score: 0.8\nThe Luas operating hours seem straightforward, but I'll make sure to double-check for any anomalies.\n\n<step> Step 2",

Break down the solution into clear steps within <step> tags. Start with a 10-step budget, requesting more for complex problems if needed. Use <count> tags after each step to show the remaining budget. Stop when reaching 0. Continuously adjust your reasoning based on intermediate results and reflections, adapting your strategy as you progress. Regularly evaluate progress using <reflection> tags. Be critical and honest about your reasoning process. Assign a quality score between 0.0 and 1.0 using <reward> tags after each reflection. Use this to guide your approach: 0.8+: Continue current approach 0.5-0.7: Consider minor adjustments Below 0.5: Seriously consider backtracking and trying a different approach If unsure or if reward score is low, backtrack and try a different approach, explaining your decision within <thinking> tags. Explore multiple solutions individually if possible, comparing approaches in reflections. Use thoughts as a scratchpad, writing out all calculations and reasoning explicitly.
