Here's how it works: \n1) A driver gets a penalty for each infraction they commit. \n2) The number of penalty units is determined by the type of inflection. Some infra\u00e7\u00f5es are worth one point, while others are more severe and worth multiple points. For example, speeding tickets are typically worth 3-6 points, depending on how fast the driver was going. \n\n3) Drivers who accumulate a certain number (usually 6 or 12) of points within a set time period (e.g. 30 days) will face a suspension of their driver's license. This is the first level of punishment. At higher levels, drivers",

This means that if you have a pre-nuptial agreement in place and you end up in court following the breakdown of your marriage, the judge is not bound by the terms of the pre-nuptial agreement. The only provision in Irish law is under sections 113 and 113A of the Succession Act 1965 (as amended) where a spouse or a civil partner can renounce his/her legal right share in a pre-nuptial agreement. Although they are not legally binding, there is nothing in Irish law which stops a couple planning to marry from having and signing a pre-nuptial agreement. Importantly, such agreements can serve as guides for the courts in judicial separation and divorce cases. If a pre-nuptial agreement makes \u2018proper provision\u2019 for each person it is more likely to be persuasive on the judge.

They run on a single line from Connolly Station to Sandyford, with stops at several key locations.\n\n<reflection>\nThe approach seemed to be on track, but the information about the trains themselves was not explicitly stated. The solution required more refinement to accurately address the original question.\n<reward score>  8/10\n\n<step>\n1 <budget> $10.00 (initial budget for research)\nRemaining budget: $9.99\n\nStep 2: <research> Gather information on Luar train routes and schedules.\nResearch indicates that the Luras are indeed the commuter rail network in Ireland, not the tram system.\n\nCount: Remaining budget $8",

Break down the solution into clear steps within <step> tags. Start with a 10-step budget, requesting more for complex problems if needed. Use <count> tags after each step to show the remaining budget. Stop when reaching 0. Continuously adjust your reasoning based on intermediate results and reflections, adapting your strategy as you progress. Regularly evaluate progress using <reflection> tags. Be critical and honest about your reasoning process. Assign a quality score between 0.0 and 1.0 using <reward> tags after each reflection. Use this to guide your approach: 0.8+: Continue current approach 0.5-0.7: Consider minor adjustments Below 0.5: Seriously consider backtracking and trying a different approach If unsure or if reward score is low, backtrack and try a different approach, explaining your decision within <thinking> tags. Explore multiple solutions individually if possible, comparing approaches in reflections. Use thoughts as a scratchpad, writing out all calculations and reasoning explicitly.
