It can also be used to renovate vacant and derelict properties that have not been used as residential properties before. However, this only applies if the non-residential properties were used for commercial or public use before and now have the correct planning permission. You can get the grant if you are refurbishing the vacant property so you can live there, or so you can rent the property out. You can get a grant of up to \u20ac50,000 to renovate a vacant property and up to \u20ac70,000, if the property is derelict. You can get more if you are living on an off-shore island. And, there is an additional grant for expert conservation advice if you are refurbishing a vacant traditional farmhouse. The Vacant Property Refurbishment Grant is funded by the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage through the Cro\u00ed C\u00f3naithe (Towns) Fund and you apply to your local authority.

Assign a final reward score.\n\nHelpful Answer:\nThe Vacant Property Refurbishment Grant is a funding scheme provided by the local authority to support the refurbishment of vacant properties to make them habitable and liveable.\n\n<reflection> Initial impression: The Vacant Property Refurbishment Grant seems to be a straightforward funding scheme for refurbishing vacant properties. However, the details suggest that the grant is inclusive of VAT and has specific funding limits for each type of work. This complexity may impact the actual amount of funding available.\n\n<reward> 0.8\n\n<step> Step 1: Determine the maximum grant amount for a vacant property\nThe grant amount is \u20ac50,000 for a vacant property, inclusive of VAT.\n\n<count> \u20ac50,000\n\n<step> Step 2: Determine the maximum grant amount for a derelict property\nThe grant amount is \u20ac70,000 for a derelict property, inclusive of VAT.\n\n<count> \u20ac20,000 (\u20ac50,000 - \u20ac70,000)\n\n<step> Step 3: Identify the types of work covered by the grant\nThe grant covers the following types of work: demolition, substructure, superstructure, external completions, internal completions, skirtings, fascias, roof completions, tiling and waterproof finishes, painting and decorating, services, kitchen units, sanitary-ware, and necessary work on land.\n\n<count> \u20ac20,000\n\n<reflection> Reward score 0.8. The grant seems to be well-defined, but the complexity of the funding limits and the types of work covered may impact the actual amount of funding available.\n\n<step> Step 4: Consider the additional funding available for off-shore island residents\nOff-shore island residents can receive up to 20% more funding for each type of work.\n\n<count> \u20ac24,000 (\u20ac20,000 x 1.2)\n\n<reflection> Reward score 0.8. The additional funding for off-shore island residents seems reasonable, but it may increase the complexity of the grant scheme.\n\n<step> Step 5: Determine the grant amount for a specific type of work\nThe grant amount is based on a cost assessment by the local authority.\n\n<count> \u20ac24,000\n\n<reflection> Reward score 0.8. The grant amount for a specific type of work is still unclear, as it depends on the cost assessment.\n\n<step> Step 6: Consider the Better Energy Homes Grant Scheme\nThe SEAI grant helps improve the energy efficiency of the home, but work covered by this scheme is not covered by the Vacant Property Refurbishment Grant.\n\n<count> \u20ac24,000\n\n<reflection> Reward score 0.8. The Better Energy Homes Grant Scheme seems to be a useful resource, but it may not be directly related to the Vacant Property Refurbishment Grant.\n\n<step> Step 7: Evaluate the grant application process\nThe grant must be approved before any work begins.\n\n<count> \u20ac24,000\n\n<reflection> Reward score 0.8. The grant application process seems straightforward, but it may be subject to approval delays.\n\n<step> Step 8: Consider the funding limits for each type of work\nThe funding limits for each type of work are set out in the table.\n\n<count> \u20ac24,000\n\n<reflection> Reward score 0.8. The funding limits for each type of work seem reasonable, but they may impact the actual amount of funding available.\n\n<step> Step 9: Evaluate the grant's impact on the renovation costs\nIf the renovation costs more than the grant, the homeowner will have to pay for the remaining amount.\n\n<count> \u20ac0\n\n<reflection> Reward score 0.8. The grant seems to be designed to support the renovation costs, but it may not cover the full amount.\n\n<step> Step 10: Determine the overall effectiveness of the Vacant Property Refurbishment Grant\nThe grant seems to be well-defined, but the complexity of the funding limits and the types of work covered may impact the actual amount of funding available.\n\n<answer> The Vacant Property Refurbishment Grant is a funding scheme provided by the local authority to support the refurbishment of vacant properties to make them habitable and liveable. The grant amount is \u20ac50,000 for a vacant property and \u20ac70,000 for a derelict property, inclusive of VAT. The grant covers a range of types of work, but the funding limits for each type of work may impact the actual amount of funding available.\n\n<reflection> Final reflection: The Vacant Property Refurbishment Grant seems to be a useful resource for homeowners, but its complexity may impact the actual amount of funding available. The grant's effectiveness depends on the homeowner's ability to meet the funding limits and obtain approval for the grant.\n\n<reward> 0.8\n\nNote: The reward score",

This means you can get 2 weeks off in a row.\n\nHoliday pay\n\nHoliday pay (pay for annual leave) must be paid in advance at your normal weekly rate .\n\nIf your pay changes from week-to-week (for example, because of commission or bonus payments), your holiday pay is the average of your pay over the 13 weeks before you take holidays.\n\nPart-time employees\n\nGenerally, annual leave for part-time workers is calculated using Method 3 above. This means you can get 8% of your hours worked.\n\nIf you work full time for some months and part-time for the rest of the year, you should calculate the leave for the full-time and the part-time periods of work separately.\n\nAgency employees\n\nIf you are an agency worker, the party who pays your wages (employment agency or client company) is the employer for the purposes of the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997 , and is responsible for providing your annual leave entitlement.\n\nCan my employer force me to take annual leave?\n\nUsually, employees can ask to take annual leave at specific times.

Depending on your employer, you can agree to take your annual leave within 6 months of the relevant leave year.Document 1:::\nYou must be paid at your normal daily rate of pay . Your employer should not make any reference to domestic violence leave on your payslip.\n\nWhat is normal daily pay?\n\nYour normal daily pay includes any regular bonus or allowance which does not change from week to week (but excludes overtime or commission).\n\nIf your pay changes from week to week , your pay for domestic violence leave is the average of your pay over the 13 weeks before you are on leave. This could be, for example, because of regular bonus payments or allowances.\n\nHow to apply\n\nCheck if your employer has a workplace domestic violence policy and follow the process to apply for the leave and other supports available.\n\nDo I need to give notice to my employer?\n\nYou do not have to give your employer notice to take domestic violence leave in emergency circumstances.\n\nYou should give notice if you are able to, or as soon as you practically can after taking it.\n\nDisclosing your experience to your employer\n\nGetting support from your employer means you need to disclose your experience to someone at work. In most jobs, employees usually tell their direct manager about absences.\n\nOr, your employer may assign a specific or designated person to handle matters related to domestic violence leave and other available support. The designated person could be a HR manager or the business owner.\n\nYour employer should make sure the designated person is well-trained to handle employee disclosures properly.\n\nCan my employer ask for proof?\n\nYou are not required to give your employer any supporting information or evidence when requesting domestic violence leave.\n\nThere might be exceptional situations where your employer could ask for supporting documents, but this would be rare and is not in line with the intentions of the law.\n\nConfidentiality\n\nYour employer should treat any information you disclose about domestic violence with the utmost sensitivity and confidentiality.\n\nThey should only share the information with those who need it for safety plans or administering domestic violence leave. Ideally, your employer should get your written permission before sharing any information.\n\nSharing information does not always mean breaking confidentiality. Your employer can find ways to share details without revealing your identity or the fact that you disclosed domestic violence.\n\nYour employment rights\n\nIn general, you will be treated as if you are in work during domestic violence leave.\n\nThis means:\n\nYour time on domestic violence leave does not break your continuous service. It also counts as service when calculating entitlements such as annual leave and public holidays.\n\nYou must not be dismissed for taking or asking to take domestic violence leave.Document 2:::\nEnglish | Gaeilge\n\nYou are here: Home > Employment > Employment rights and conditions > Leave and holidays > Other types of leave from work\n\nOther types of leave from work\n\nTaking time off work\n\nForce majeure leave\n\nLeave for medical care\n\nCompassionate leave\n\nJury service\n\nCareer break or study leave\n\nHow to make a complaint\n\nMore information\n\nTaking time off work\n\nThere are different reasons you might need time off work, for example:\n\nIf you have a family crisis, like a sudden illness in your family\n\nIf you are called for jury service\n\nIf you want to take study leave or a career break\n\nIn some cases, you are entitled to be paid for your leave, but in others you are not.\n\nYou may also want to read about types of statutory leave from work, including:\n\nAnnual leave\n\nPublic holidays\n\nSick leave\n\nMaternity leave\n\nPaternity leave\n\nAdoptive leave\n\nCarer\u2019s leave\n\nParental leave\n\nParent's leave\n\nLeave for medical care\n\nDomestic violence leave\n\nForce majeure leave\n\nIf you have a family crisis, you have a right to limited time off work.

However, in general, employees usually have the right to request annual leave, and employers are not typically allowed to force employees to take it.\n\n\nStep 1: Review the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997, which sets out the rules for annual leave entitlement. \n(count: 9/10)\n\nStep 2: Check the employment contract to see if there are any specific provisions regarding annual leave. \n(count: 8.5/10)\n\nStep 3: Consider the employee's rights regarding annual leave, including the right to request leave and the right to be paid for it. \n(count: 8/10)\n\nStep 4: Think about the employer's obligations regarding annual leave, including the need to discuss leave with the employee and to ensure that the employee is not unfairly disadvantaged. \n(count: 7.5/10)\n\nStep 5: Consider the potential consequences of forcing an employee to take annual leave, including the risk of unfair dismissal and the impact on the employee's well-being. \n(count: 7/10)\n\nStep 6: Review the relevant case law and guidance on the issue of annual leave entitlement. \n(count: 6.5/10)\n\nStep 7: Consider the potential for the employer to argue that the employee is not entitled to annual leave in certain circumstances, such as if the employee has changed employment during the leave year. \n(count: 6/10)\n\nStep 8: Think about the potential for the employee to challenge the employer's decision to force them to take annual leave, including the possibility of taking the matter to an employment tribunal. \n(count: 5.5/10)\n\nStep 9: Review the relevant legislation and guidance on the issue of unfair dismissal and the potential consequences of forcing an employee to take annual leave. \n(count: 5/10)\n\nStep 10: Consider the overall balance of power between the employer and the employee, including the need for the employer to balance the need for business needs with the employee's rights and interests. \n(count: 4.5/10)\n\nReflection: The process of considering the various factors and provisions relevant to the issue of annual leave entitlement has been helpful in providing a clear understanding of the employee's rights and the employer's obligations. However, the complexity of the issue and the need to consider multiple factors and provisions has made it challenging to provide a definitive answer. \n(reward: 0.7)\n\nAnswer: In general, employees usually have the right to request annual leave, and employers are not typically allowed to force employees to take it. However, the specific circumstances and employment contract can affect the outcome. It is recommended that employees review their employment contract and seek advice from a relevant authority if they are unsure about their rights.\n\nFinal Reflection: The process of considering the various factors and provisions relevant to the issue of annual leave entitlement has been helpful in providing a clear understanding of the employee's rights and the employer's obligations. However, the complexity of the issue and the need to consider multiple factors and provisions has made it challenging to provide a definitive answer. In the future, it is recommended that employees review their employment contract and seek advice from a relevant authority if they are unsure about their rights. \n(reward: 0.8) \n\nNote: The final reward score is based on the reflection and the overall effectiveness of the approach. It is slightly higher than the average reward score, indicating that the approach was generally effective but could be improved with further refinement. \n\nThis solution was generated using a combination of natural language processing and machine learning algorithms. The goal was to provide a clear and concise answer to the question, taking into account the specific context and the relevant legislation and guidance. The solution involved breaking down the problem into smaller steps, considering multiple factors and provisions, and evaluating the progress and effectiveness of the approach at each stage. The final answer was synthesized based on the information gathered and the analysis conducted. \n\nNote: The final answer is based on the provided context and may not be applicable to all situations. It is recommended that employees review their employment contract and seek advice from a relevant authority if they are unsure about their rights. \n\nLet's break down the solution step by step:\n\n\nThinking: The question is asking whether an employer can force an employee to take annual leave. This is not a straightforward question, and the answer depends on the specific circumstances and the employment contract.\n\n\nStep 1: Review the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997, which sets out the rules for annual leave entitlement. \n(count: 9/10)\n\nThis step involves reviewing the relevant legislation and guidance on the issue of annual leave entitlement.

Periodic tenancy agreements may or may not be in writing.\n\nYour landlord can end the tenancy at any time during the first 6 months of the tenancy without having to give a reason, but, in general, you will get security of tenure after 6 months \u2013 see \u2018Part 4 tenancy\u2019 below. You must always get a valid written notice of termination and there are rules about how much notice you must be given, depending on the length of the tenancy (with some exceptions). Read more in our page If your landlord wants you to leave .\n\nAs a tenant, you can end the periodic tenancy at any time. You do not have to give a reason. Again, there are rules about notice periods and what constitutes a valid notice of termination \u2013 see \u2018Ending your tenancy\u2019 below.\n\nClaiming a Part 4 tenancy at the end of a fixed-term lease\n\nIf you have a fixed-term contract or lease and you want to remain in the property under a Part 4 tenancy, you should notify your landlord of your intention to stay in the property. You should do this between 3 months and 1 month before your fixed\u2013term tenancy or lease agreement expires.\n\nIf you do not notify your landlord, you cannot be refused coverage under Part 4, but you may have to compensate the landlord for any financial loss that they have because you did not notify them of your intention to remain in the tenancy.\n\nEnding your tenancy\n\nThe following section outlines what a tenant must do to end a tenancy. There are different rules for landlords who want to end a tenancy . The RTB also has information on their website about how a tenant can end a tenancy .\n\nFormat of termination notice\n\nAs a tenant, you can terminate your tenancy (whether fixed-term or periodic) without giving a reason, but you must give a valid notice of termination to your landlord. In order to be valid, this notice must:\n\nBe in writing\n\nBe signed by you\n\nSpecify the date that you are serving it on the landlord\n\nSpecify the termination date of the tenancy (you have the full 24 hours of this date to vacate possession)Document 1:::\nYou do not have security of tenure . This came in under the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2019 (pdf) .\n\nYou cannot be forced to pay for student-specific accommodation during the summer when you don\u2019t need it. Your tenancy or licence arrangement should not be more than 41 weeks, unless you ask for longer. If your landlord does not comply with the 41-week rule you should contact to the RTB, who can sanction your landlord. This rule came in under the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2024 and applies to tenancies and licence arrangements in student-specific accommodation created from 20 July 2024.\n\nYou only need to give your landlord 28 days\u2019 notice when ending a tenancy. You can give your landlord more notice if you want and your landlord must give you more.

This rule came in under the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2024 .\n\nFind out more about your rights as a tenant in student-specific accommodation on the RTB\u2019s website .\n\nSecurity of tenure\n\nSecurity of tenure is a tenant\u2019s right to stay in rented accommodation for a set amount of time. Generally, security of tenure applies automatically when you have been renting for 6 months and haven\u2019t received a valid notice of termination from your landlord in that time. When you have security of tenure, your landlord can only terminate your tenancy for a limited number of reasons, see our page \u2018 If your landlord wants you to leave \u2019.\n\nThe amount of time you are entitled to stay in rented accommodation after the first 6 months depends on when your tenancy began.\n\nIf your tenancy was created after 10 June 2022 , you have a tenancy of unlimited duration. This means if you have rented somewhere for 6 months, you have the right to stay in that accommodation indefinitely (no end date), unless the landlord wants to terminate your tenancy for one of the allowed reasons.Document 2:::\nIf this is not done, the notice of termination is invalid. The RTB recommends that landlords use certified post when posting the notice of termination to the tenant and the RTB, and that they keep proof of this.\n\nWhen the RTB receives the notice of termination it will:\n\nWrite to you and your landlord about the RTB services and outline your rights and responsibilities under residential tenancies legislation\n\nAsk for your contact details in case the landlord needs them to offer the property back to you. This will only be done with your consent\n\nThis requirement is in place since 6 July 2022, when it was brought in under the Regulation of Providers of Building Works and Miscellaneous Provisions Act 2022.\n\nThe RTB's website has more information about these changes .\n\nWhat is a valid notice of termination?\n\nThe law sets out the requirements for a valid notice of termination. It must:\n\nBe in writing (an email is not sufficient)\n\nBe signed by the landlord (or an authorised agent)\n\nSpecify the date of termination of the tenancy\n\nState that you have the whole 24 hours of the termination date to vacate the property\n\nSpecify the date of the notice itself\n\nState the reason for termination, if a tenancy has lasted more than 6 months or is a fixed-term tenancy. (This does not have to be included for tenancies in student-specific accommodation.)\n\nState that any issue about the validity of the notice or the right of the landlord to serve it must be referred to the RTB within 90 days from the receipt of the notice. (This 90-day timeframe applies unless the tenant is in breach of their obligations.)\n\nYour landlord must give additional details in certain situations and, in some cases, a statutory declaration. The information below describes the additional details needed for each of the valid reasons for terminating your tenancy. The RTB also provides sample notices of termination , with the details required in each situation.\n\nIf the property is being sold\n\nIf your landlord intends to sell the property within 9 months of the terminating your tenancy, the notice of termination must state that:\n\n\u201cThe reason for the termination of the tenancy is due to the fact that the landlord intends to sell the dwelling, for full consideration, within 9 months after the termination of the tenancy\u201d.\n\nQuestion: What is a valid reason for ending a tenancy after the first 6 months?\n\nBegin by enclosing all thoughts within <thinking> tags, exploring multiple angles and approaches.

If you adopt a child who is resident in Ireland, it is called domestic adoption .\n\nWhen you adopt a child, they become a member of your family. Adoption creates a legal relationship between the adoptive parents and the child.\n\nAs intercountry adoption is a complex legal process, you should get legal advice from a solicitor who specialises in intercountry adoption. See 'More information about intercountry adoption' below.\n\nWho can adopt?\n\nYou must be at least 21 years of age to adopt a child under Irish law. There is no Irish legal upper age limit for adopting parents but age is a factor in determining suitability here.\n\nYou must also:\n\nHave a valid 'declaration of eligibility and suitability' (see 'Being assessed for eligibility to adopt' below)\n\nBe \u2018habitually resident in the State\u2019, which means Ireland has become your home. Living in Ireland for at least one year before the date of the making of the adoption order would generally be sufficient.\n\nYour relationship status does not necessarily impact your eligibility to adopt a child. This means you are eligible to adopt if you are:\n\nA married couple\n\nA couple living together in a civil partnership\n\nA couple cohabiting together in a relationship for at least 3 years (living together but not married or in a civil partnership)\n\nA sole applicant who is not in one of the categories listed above (only where the Adoption Authority is satisfied that, in the particular circumstances of the case, it is desirable and in the best interests of the child)\n\nYou may also be eligible to adopt if you are the mother, father or relative of the child. \u2018Relative\u2019 means a grandparent, brother, sister, uncle or aunt of the child (or the spouse of any such person), with the relationship to the child being traced through either the mother or the father.Document 2:::\nTo request an Immigration Clearance Letter, you need to write to:\n\nForeign Adoptions Unit\n\nUnit 3 Domestic Residence & Permissions Division\n\n4th floor\n\nImmigration Service Delivery\n\nDepartment of Justice\n\n13-14 Burgh Quay\n\nDublin 2\n\nD02 XK70\n\nYou must include:\n\nA letter of application, with a daytime contact number\n\nA photocopy of the passport of each adopter\n\nTwo passport size photographs of each adopter\n\nThe original Declaration of Eligibility and Suitability (not a copy)\n\nA letter from the Adoption Authority stating how many children you are eligible to adopt and from what country\n\nThese documents will be returned to you with your Immigration Clearance Letter, when approved. You will need to show this letter to an immigration officer when you return to Ireland.\n\nSteps to take once the child arrives in Ireland\n\nTell the Adoption Authority that the child has arrived\n\nYou must tell the Adoption Authority of Ireland and Tusla when you bring the child to Ireland for the first time after adoption in the country of origin. Find contact details in the section \u2018More information about intercountry adoption\u2019 below.\n\nYou must also tell the Adoption Authority and Tusla if you have brought the child to Ireland, in order to adopt the child through domestic adoption .\n\nYou must do this within 3 months of the child arriving in Ireland.\n\nRegister the adoption in Ireland\n\nIf the child was adopted in the country of origin, the final step in the intercountry adoption process is the registration of the adoption. This is the formal, legal recognition of the adoption by the Irish State.\n\nYou must complete and submit an application for registration of the adoption (pdf) to the Adoption Authority within 3 months of re-entering Ireland following the adoption.\n\nThe Adoption Authority can register the adoption in the \u2018Register of Intercountry Adoptions\u2019, on the basis of an \u2018Article 23 certificate\u2019. An Article 23 certificate is a certificate of assurance from the child\u2019s country of origin that proves the adoption was carried out in compliance with the Hague Convention.\n\nGetting an adoption certificate\n\nWhen the adoption has been registered, it will appear on the Register of Intercountry Adoptions. The register has details of the adopted child and the adoptive parents. It is a public register and is open to scrutiny by members of the public.\n\nQuestion: Who can adopt a child in Ireland?\n\nBegin by enclosing all thoughts within <thinking> tags, exploring multiple angles and approaches.

If you have been caught speeding on a police traffic camera, you will get a notice of your fine and penalty points for the offence by post. You have 28 days in which to pay your fine from the date the notice is issued to you. If you do not pay your fine, the fine then increases to \u20ac240, which you must pay within 28 days. If after this time (56 days) you still have not paid your fine, the offence is referred to the courts. If you are convicted in court of speeding offences and non-payment of fines, you will automatically receive 5 penalty points and a fine up to a maximum of \u20ac1,000.\n\nSeatbelt offences : If you drive without a seatbelt or allow children under 17 years to travel in your car without a seatbelt, you will incur a fixed charge fine of \u20ac120. You must pay this fine within 28 days or face an increased fine of \u20ac180 payable within 56 days of the offence. 3 penalty points will be added to your licence if you pay the fine on time.

The continuous employment requirement is 104 weeks.\n\nReckonable service, on the other hand, is the amount of time a person has been employed by their employer, which is used to calculate redundancy pay. Reckonable service is not necessarily the same as continuous employment, as it may include periods of absence or leave.\n\nThe key distinction between the two is that continuous employment is a prerequisite for qualifying for redundancy, while reckonable service is used to calculate the amount of redundancy pay.\n\nIn other words, you must have 104 weeks of continuous employment to qualify for redundancy, but the length of reckonable service may be shorter if you have taken time off or been absent from work.\n\nTo summarize:\n\n*   Continuous employment is the length of time you have been employed in your job that counts towards qualifying for redundancy.\n*   Reckonable service is the amount of time you have been employed by your employer, which is used to calculate redundancy pay.\n*   Continuous employment is a prerequisite for qualifying for redundancy, while reckonable service is used to calculate the amount of redundancy pay.\n\nTherefore, continuous employment and reckonable service are not the same.\n\nAnswer:\nContinuous employment and reckonable service are not the same.\n\nReflection:\nThe key distinction between the two is that continuous employment is a prerequisite for qualifying for redundancy, while reckonable service is used to calculate the amount of redundancy pay. This distinction is crucial in understanding the difference between continuous employment and reckonable service.\n\nReward:\n0.9\n\nThinking:\nTo answer the question, we need to understand the definitions of continuous employment and reckonable service. Continuous employment refers to the length of time a person has been working in their current job, which is essential for qualifying for redundancy. Reckonable service, on the other hand, is the amount of time a person has been employed by their employer, which is used to calculate redundancy pay.\n\nStep 1: Understand the definitions of continuous employment and reckonable service.\nStep 2: Recognize that continuous employment is a prerequisite for qualifying for redundancy.\nStep 3: Acknowledge that reckonable service is used to calculate the amount of redundancy pay.\n\nCount: 10\n\nStep 4: Clarify that continuous employment and reckonable service are not the same.\nStep 5: Explain that continuous employment is a prerequisite for qualifying for redundancy.\nStep 6: Describe how reckonable service is used to calculate redundancy pay.\n\nCount: 5\n\nStep 7: Summarize the key distinction between continuous employment and reckonable service.\nStep 8: Emphasize that continuous employment is a prerequisite for qualifying for redundancy.\nStep 9: Highlight that reckonable service is used to calculate the amount of redundancy pay.\n\nCount: 0\n\nAnswer:\nContinuous employment and reckonable service are not the same.\n\nFinal Reflection:\nThe key distinction between continuous employment and reckonable service is that continuous employment is a prerequisite for qualifying for redundancy, while reckonable service is used to calculate the amount of redundancy pay. This distinction is crucial in understanding the difference between continuous employment and reckonable service. By recognizing this distinction, individuals can better understand their rights and entitlements when it comes to redundancy pay.",

It was replaced by the Work Placement Experience Programme (WPEP) .\n\nThis page can be used for reference purposes for information on the operation of the YESS up until it closed on 12 July 2021.\n\nThe Youth Employment Support Scheme (YESS) supported long-term unemployed young people back into the workplace. It started on 1 October 2018 and ended in July 2021.\n\nYESS aimed to give you the opportunity to learn basic work and social skills in a supportive environment, while on a work placement in a host organisation. You must have been aged 18\u201324, unemployed and getting a qualifying social welfare payment for at least 12 months \u2013 see 'Rules' below. If you were unemployed for less than 12 months, you must have faced a significant barrier to work to qualify.\n\nParticipation was voluntary. There was no financial penalties if you did not want to participate in the scheme or if you dropped out.\n\nThe scheme was open to host organisations in the private, community and voluntary sectors only. Public service bodies, including schools and colleges, could not host YESS placements.\n\nYESS was a scheme under the Irish Youth Guarantee . A previous placement scheme, First Steps , which was similar to YESS, finished on 30 March 2018. YESS is no longer available and was replaced by the Work Placement Experience Programme (WPEP) .\n\nWho was eligible for YESS?\n\nPeople aged between 18 and 24 and:\n\nHad been out of work and getting a qualifying payment (see below) for at least 12 months or\n\nFaced a significant barrier to work (if unemployed for less than 12 months)\n\nWhat were the qualifying payments?Document 1:::\nCOVID-19 recovery and cost of living business supports\n\nThis page summarises the supports for businesses as they recover from COVID-19 disruptions and deal with the rising costs of living.\n\n1452.6732\n\nYouth Employment Support Scheme (YESS)\n\nThe Youth Employment Support Scheme (YESS) is closed.

The placement was monitored with monthly reporting to make sure that it continued to meet the scheme guidelines.\n\nTraining and development\n\nParticipants could get a Training Support Grant of up to \u20ac500 if needed. The grant was available up 2 times in a 12-month period. The grant was increased from \u20ac500 to \u20ac1,000 under the July Jobs Stimulus .\n\nDuration of scheme\n\nThe scheme lasted for 3 months, with the option to extend the placement to 6 months if the DSP agreed. Participants could spend a maximum of 6 months on a placement with the same host organisation.\n\nYou could be eligible to do 3 placements in total, up to a maximum period of 18 months (78 weeks).\n\nParticipants worked 24 hours per week over 3 days or 4 days.\n\nRates\n\nParticipants were paid a weekly YESS allowance of \u20ac229.20 by DSP. However, if their current social welfare payment was more than this allowance, they continued to receive their current social welfare payment plus a top-up of \u20ac22.50 per week.\n\n_Page edited: 8 February 2024 _\n\nRelated documents\n\nGarda Youth Diversion Programme\n\nThe aim of the Garda Youth Diversion Programme is to prevent young offenders in Ireland from entering into the full criminal justice system by offering them a second chance.\n\n1297.265\n\nWork Placement Experience Programme (WPEP)\n\nQuestion: Who was eligible for YESS (Youth Employment Support Scheme)?\n\nBegin by enclosing all thoughts within <thinking> tags, exploring multiple angles and approaches.

Usually, the GP you select must be within 7 miles of where you live. If the GP agrees to accept you as a patient for medical card GP services , you can send them the form to sign.\n\nIf you use the printed application form and you have been a medical card patient within the last 6 months and you want to keep the same GP, you should state this on your form.\n\nIf your preferred participating GP cannot accept you as a medical card patient, they may not be currently accepting new patients and you should try another participating GP in your area (pdf) .\n\nIf you are refused by 3 GPs, the HSE will assign a doctor to you. State this on your application, including the 3 names of declining GPs and their clinics. The GPs need to be based at three different clinics.\n\nMedical cards for children and young people\n\nIf you have a medical card, your child is included as a dependent on that card and can get the same medical card services as you. If you do not qualify for a medical card, your child may still get a medical card if they:\n\nAre in residential care\n\nLiving in Direct Provision\n\nHave been diagnosed with cancer within the last 5 years\n\nAre in foster care\n\nAdding an infant to your card\n\nIf you have a medical card and you have a baby, you can apply for a card for them if you are getting Child Benefit for your new baby.Document 2:::\nIf the child already has a medical card or GP visit card, you do not need to register; they will be automatically registered for a medical card.\n\nChildren diagnosed with cancer\n\nChildren under the age of 18 who have been diagnosed with cancer within the last 5 years are eligible for a medical card without a means test. The application form does not require information about income but does require a medical report. You can download the Medical Card Application Form for Children under 18 years, Form MC1 (b) (pdf).\n\nGP visit card for children under 8\n\nIf your child does not qualify for a medical card and is under 8, they can get a GP visit card for children under 8 without a means test.

For example, if your income or family circumstances change, you must inform the Medical Card Unit as soon as possible \u2014 their contact details are at the end of this webpage.\n\nMedical card expiry date\n\nYour medical card is valid for a set period of time. It has a \u2018valid to\u2019 date on it.\n\nYour card will be reviewed by the HSE periodically. The HSE will write to you at the address you applied with to check if you still qualify for a medical card.\n\nThey will also review your details to check if you qualify before they renew your card.\n\nMedical card reviews and renewals\n\nYou may be sent a letter with a PIN code from the HSE, inviting you to use the online medical card application system to review your medical card.\n\nIf you do not provide the information they ask for, your application cannot be re-assessed and your card may not be re-issued.\n\nIf you need a paper form, rather than the online review form, complete and return MC1 Medical Card and GP Visit Card Application Form (pdf) .

However, they do provide information on the benefits and eligibility criteria, which suggests that a medical card is a means of accessing medical services.\n\n<reward> 0.6\n\n<step> Step 3: Analyze the information and make an educated guess\nBased on the information provided, I believe that a medical card is a card issued by the HSE to a person who is eligible for medical card services. The card allows the holder to access various medical services without incurring out-of-pocket costs.\n\n<reflection> I am fairly confident in my answer, but I realize that I may have made an assumption about the definition of a medical card. I should have been more careful in my analysis.\n\n<reward> 0.8\n\n<step> Step 4: Review and refine the answer\nBased on my analysis, I believe that a medical card is a card issued by the HSE to a person who is eligible for medical card services.

As a result, they are not strictly binding. This means that if you have a pre-nuptial agreement in place and you end up in court following the breakdown of your marriage, the judge is not bound by the terms of the pre-nuptial agreement.\n\nThe only provision in Irish law is under sections 113 and 113A of the Succession Act 1965 (as amended) where a spouse or a civil partner can renounce his/her legal right share in a pre-nuptial agreement.\n\nAlthough they are not legally binding, there is nothing in Irish law which stops a couple planning to marry from having and signing a pre-nuptial agreement.

Therefore, in situations where one party is likely to inherit a significant family farm or business, it will guide the judge in the divorce or judicial separation on what the parties\u2019 intentions were at the outset.\n\nDrafting a pre-nuptial agreement\n\nOnly pre-nuptial agreements entered into following independent legal advice for both parties are likely to be taken into account. The court would have to be satisfied that there had been a complete disclosure of assets before the agreement was signed. It is also advisable for the agreement to provide for reviews:\n\nPeriodically (for example, every five years)\n\nIf children are born\n\nIf there is a major change in circumstances (for example, assets are purchased or sold)\n\nThe agreement should be in writing, be signed by each party and comply with the rules of contract law.\n\nThe future of pre-nuptial agreementsDocument 1:::\nYou must notify the personal representative of the deceased of your application for provision from the deceased\u2019s estate within 6 months of an application for a grant of probate .\n\nIn general, if your cohabiting relationship ended two years or more before your ex-partner died, you cannot apply for provision from the estate unless you were getting regular or periodic payments from the deceased.\n\nWhat is a cohabitation agreement?\n\nIf you live with your partner but you do not intend to marry, you should protect your financial interests by entering into a \u2018 cohabitation agreement \u2019 (also called a cohabitant\u2019s agreement). This is a voluntary, signed agreement, which allows you to specify the day-to-day joint financial arrangements of your relationship, such as:\n\nThe payment of joint debts\n\nThe payment of common household expenses\n\nYou can also specify how you plan to separate your assets, such as shared property, should the relationship come to an end. In the event of a break-up, a cohabitation agreement can make the division of your assets more straightforward.\n\nYour cohabitation agreement may include a provision that the redress scheme does not apply to you (for example, you can both agree not to apply for a maintenance order should your relationship end). This is different from similar agreements by married couples. Agreements between married couples cannot exclude either party\u2019s right to apply to the courts for various orders (for example, a maintenance order).\n\nIs a cohabitation agreement valid in court?\n\nIf you and your partner make a cohabitation agreement (an agreement on joint financial matters), it is only valid if:\n\nEach of you has had independent legal advice, or you got legal advice together and have waived the right to independent legal advice (see \u2018More information\u2019 below)\n\nThe agreement is a contract\n\nThe agreement has been signed by each of you\n\nIn exceptional circumstances, the court may set aside or vary (change) your cohabitation agreement (for example, if the enforcement of the agreement would cause serious injustice).\n\nIf you and your cohabitant entered into an agreement before the 2010 Act commenced, it is enforceable.\n\nMore information\n\nIf you are concerned about your rights following the breakdown of your cohabiting relationship, you should get legal advice.Document 2:::\nYour executor must inform your spouse or civil partner in writing of their right to choose between these two options. Your spouse or civil partner must ask for their legal right share within 6 months of being notified, or within 12 months of the taking out of the Grant of Representation.\n\nWhere a legal right share does not apply\n\nYour spouse or civil partner can renounce (give up) their rights to the legal right share. This can be part of an agreement before marriage or civil partnership or the spouse or civil partner can give up their rights to benefit their children or other named beneficiaries.\n\nIf there is evidence of undue influence or evidence that the spouse or civil partner did not understand what they were doing, the renunciation may be challenged. It is normally advised that a spouse or civil partner get independent legal advice if renouncing their legal right share.\n\nThe legal right share can be lost where the spouse or civil partner is:\n\nConvicted of the murder, manslaughter or attempted murder of the deceased person\n\nConvicted of an offence against the deceased person or a child that carries a sentence of more than 2 years\n\nDivorce, separation and desertion\n\nSeparation agreements usually include a renunciation of both spouses\u2019 or civil partner\u2019s legal right share.\n\nIf you are divorced or your civil partnership was dissolved, you do not have to provide a legal right share.\n\nIf your spouse or civil partner deserted you for more than 2 years, they are not entitled to a legal right share unless they deserted you as a result of your behaviour (for example, domestic abuse).\n\nCohabiting partners\n\nPartners, who live with each other but are not married or in a civil partnership, have no automatic legal right to each other's estates, although under the redress scheme for cohabiting couples introduced by the Civil Partnership and Certain Rights and Obligations of Cohabitants Act 2010 a qualified cohabitant can apply for a share of the estate of a deceased cohabitant.\n\nYou can leave some or all of your estate to your partner but this does not cancel out the legal rights of a spouse or civil partner if you were married before to someone else and did not get divorced or had your civil partnership dissolved.\n\nRights of children under a will\n\nChildren do not have any absolute right to inherit any of their parent's estate if the parent has made a will. Children born inside or outside marriage and adopted children all have the same rights and there are no age restrictions.\n\nQuestion: What is the legal status of pre-nuptial agreements?\n\nBegin by enclosing all thoughts within <thinking> tags, exploring multiple angles and approaches.

Break down the solution into clear steps within <step> tags. Start with a 10-step budget, requesting more for complex problems if needed. Use <count> tags after each step to show the remaining budget. Stop when reaching 0. Continuously adjust your reasoning based on intermediate results and reflections, adapting your strategy as you progress. Regularly evaluate progress using <reflection> tags. Be critical and honest about your reasoning process. Assign a quality score between 0.0 and 1.0 using <reward> tags after each reflection. Use this to guide your approach: 0.8+: Continue current approach 0.5-0.7: Consider minor adjustments Below 0.5: Seriously consider backtracking and trying a different approach If unsure or if reward score is low, backtrack and try a different approach, explaining your decision within <thinking> tags. Explore multiple solutions individually if possible, comparing approaches in reflections. Use thoughts as a scratchpad, writing out all calculations and reasoning explicitly.
