It happens when your job in the company no longer exists, you are let go and are not replaced.\n\nRedundancy is a last option\n\nYour employer must consult with you before deciding to make you redundant. Redundancy is a last option and there must be valid economic, technical, or organisational grounds justifying changes in the workforce.\n\nBefore your employer makes you redundant, they might offer you another job in the business. This is known as \u2018 alternative work \u2019.\n\nWhat counts as genuine redundancy?\n\nYour employer must be able to justify that there is a genuine reason for making you redundant.\n\nA genuine redundancy is one where your employer has a real business reason to make you redundant.\n\nReasons for redundancy include:\n\nFinancial difficulties within the business: for example, your employer needs to cut costs and this means staff numbers must be reduced.\n\nLack of work : for example, your employer no longer needs or has a reduced need for employees with your skills or new technology has made your job unnecessary.\n\nReorganisation within the business: for example, your employer has decided to carry on the business with fewer or no staff or the job you do no longer exists.\n\nBusiness closure : the business is closing down or moving.\n\nThe difference between redundancy and dismissal\n\nRedundancy\n\nRedundancy is dismissal from your job, caused by your employer needing to reduce the workforce resulting in your job no longer existing.\n\nThe burden of proof is on your employer to show that a legitimate redundancy situation exists and that therefore the dismissal is fair.\n\nFor the dismissal to be fair, your employer must also show that you were fairly selected for redundancy and that fair procedures were followed.\n\nIf you do not agree that the dismissal is fair, you need to show one or more of the following:Document 1:::\nEnglish | Gaeilge\n\nYou are here: Home > Employment > Unemployment and redundancy > Dismissal > Unfair dismissal\n\nUnfair dismissal\n\nWhat is unfair dismissal?\n\nCan I bring a claim for unfair dismissal?\n\nWho cannot bring a claim for unfair dismissal?\n\nHow to bring a claim for unfair dismissal\n\nIf your claim is successful\n\nDismissal from fixed-term or specified-purpose contracts\n\nMore information\n\nWhat is unfair dismissal?\n\nIf you are dismissed from work, the dismissal is automatically considered to be \u2018unfair\u2019 if you are dismissed for:\n\nMembership (or proposed membership) of a trade union, or for engaging in trade union activities\n\nReligious or political opinions\n\nLegal proceedings against an employer where you are a party or a witness\n\nRace, colour, sexual orientation, age, or membership of the Traveller community\n\nPregnancy, giving birth, breastfeeding, or any other matters connected with pregnancy or birth (such as attending antenatal classes)\n\nAvailing of rights under legislation to maternity leave, adoptive leave, paternity leave, carer\u2019s leave, parent\u2019s leave, parental leave or force majeure leave\n\nUnfair selection for redundancy\n\nMaking a protected disclosure (that is, where you raise concerns about possible wrongdoing at work) under the Protected Disclosures Act 2014\n\nUnfair dismissal happens where:\n\nYour employer ends your contract of employment, with or without notice\n\nYou end your contract of employment, with or without notice, due to the conduct of your employer. This is known as constructive dismissal.\n\nWhat does not count as \u2018unfair\u2019 dismissal?\n\nYour dismissal from work is not \u2018unfair\u2019 if it results from:\n\nYour capability, competence or qualifications for the job\n\nYour conduct (behaviour)\n\nYou being unable to work (or continue to work) in the position you held without breaking the law (for example, if your job involves driving and you are then legally disqualified from driving)\n\nYour redundancy (read more about redundancy below)\n\nIn general, redundancy is a fair reason for dismissal. However, you may have grounds (reasons) for complaint if you were unfairly selected for redundancy , or if you feel there was no genuine need for redundancy.\n\nUnless your employer can prove there was a genuine redundancy situation and that they followed fair procedures , your dismissal may be considered \u2018unfair\u2019.\n\nIf you make a claim for unfair dismissal, you cannot also claim redundancy.\n\nCan I bring a claim for unfair dismissal?Document 2:::\nYou are made redundant on carer\u2019s leave\n\nIf you are dismissed on grounds of redundancy, while on carer\u2019s leave , under the Carer\u2019s Leave Act 2001 it would be considered unfair dismissal.\n\nIf your employer does not allow you to return to work at the end of your carer\u2019s leave you may be able to bring a claim under the unfair dismissals legislation. However you may be made redundant after you have returned to work.\n\nI think I was unfairly selected or there wasn\u2019t a genuine redundancy\n\nsituation\n\nIf you feel that your employer has selected you unfairly, or that there was no genuine redundancy situation, you can bring a claim for unfair dismissal.\n\nYou think you were unfairly selected\n\nYour employer should use fair and reasonable selection criteria in choosing people to make redundant.\n\nExamples where your selection could be unfair include:\n\nWhere the custom and practice in your workplace has been last in, first out and your selection did not follow this procedure\n\nWhere your employment contract sets out criteria for selection which were not followed\n\nYour redundancy is unfair if your employer has discriminated in selecting you for redundancy. For example if they make you redundant because you\u2019re pregnant or on maternity leave.\n\nYour employer could also have chosen you for an unfair reason. Unfair reasons include making you redundant because you\u2019ve asked for one of your legal rights, made a health and safety complaint or been on an official strike.\n\nYou think there was no genuine redundancy situation\n\nA genuine redundancy is one where your employer has a real business reason to make you redundant.\n\nSigns your redundancy might not be a genuine include:\n\nYour employer has recently hired new employees to do similar work\n\nYou have a bad relationship with your employer or other people at work\n\nYou are singled out or treated differently from other people at work\n\nThe laws on redundancy\n\nThe laws on redundancy are set out in the Redundancy Payments Acts 1967\u20132014 .\n\nThe requirements to consult on collective redundancies are set out in the Protection of Employment Acts 1977-2024 as amended, and the Employees (Provision of Information and Consultation) Act 2006.\n\nMore information\n\nYou can get more information about your employment rights from the WRC.

If your last passport was issued over 15 years ago, you will have to apply as if you were a first-time applicant.\n\nThe Passport Service strongly recommends that you apply for your passport at least 8 weeks before your travel date if you are applying by post and at least 20 days if you apply online.\n\nThe latest turnaround times are available on the Passport Service's website. If you need to send documents, the processing time will only start when the Passport Office receives them. Applying online is the quickest way to get a new passport.\n\nYou can apply for your first Irish passport:\n\nOnline, through Passport Online\n\nBy post, through Post Passport\n\nYou can also get more information on replacing a lost or stolen passport and how to renew your passport .\n\nPassport Online service\n\nYou can use the Passport Online service to apply for your first Irish passport from anywhere in the world.\n\nYou need access to a printer for your first passport application.

You will have to send original documents to the Passport Service after you have completed the online application form.\n\nDigital photographs\n\nYou must include a digital photo as part of your online application.\n\nYou can do this in 3 ways:\n\nHave your photo taken at a participating photo provider, who will give you a unique code to include with your online application.\n\nHave your photo taken at a photo provider, and ask them to email it to you, or save the photo on a USB device, or another storage method. You must have access to the photo when completing your online application.Document 1:::\nIf you live abroad\n\nIf you live outside of Ireland, you should contact a registrar to get permission to make your 3-month notification by post. If permission is granted, the registrar will send you a form which you must complete and return.\n\nYou will still have to meet the registrar in person at least 5 days before you get married to sign the declaration form. The registrar will then give you a Marriage Registration Form.\n\nInterview with the registrar\n\nIf either you or your partner are not an EU citizen, you will both need to attend an interview with the registrar.

Send a photocopy (in addition to the original) of the page you want returned to you.Document 2:::\nYou do not have to use a solicitor to complete your application. If you decide to use a solicitor, you may save money by getting quotes from a number of different law firms.\n\nDocumentation\n\nThe supporting documents you need depend on your situation. If your documents are in a language other than English, you must get them translated by a professional translating service. The Irish Translators\u2019 and Interpreters\u2019 Association has a list of professional translators.\n\nIn all cases, you will need to provide evidence of your identity and nationality.\n\nFrom 20 April 2023, new applicants are only required to provide a certified colour photocopy of the biometric page of their current passport. Your photocopy must be certified by a solicitor, commissioner for oaths, peace commissioner or a notary public. The ISD can still ask you to submit your full passport \u2013 it is expected that 10% of applicants will be asked to submit their full passport.\n\nScorecard system\n\nISD now uses a \u2018scorecard\u2019 system for assessing identification and residence history.

You can ask a solicitor to certify your documents when you are making your statutory declaration (see Step 4 below). These include:\n\nYour birth certificate\n\nYour spouse\u2019s birth certificate (if your application is based on marriage to an Irish citizen)\n\nYour marriage certificate or civil partnership certificate (if your application is based on marriage to an Irish citizen)\n\nYour passport\n\nYou can find a full list of the documents you need to send when you apply.\n\nProblems with documents\n\nIf you are unable to include documents that are listed and you have tried to get copies of the documents but are unable to, you should explain the reason why you cannot include the documents.\n\nQuestion: How long will my passport application take?\n\nBegin by enclosing all thoughts within <thinking> tags, exploring multiple angles and approaches.

            "question": "Can my employer force me to take annual leave?",
            "raw_answer": "Use the following pieces of context to reason step by step before answering the question.\n\n\nExtracted documents:\nDocument 0:::\nYou cannot use this method if you changed employment during the leave year.\n\nMethod 2\n\nCalculate 1/3 of a working week for each calendar month in which you worked at least 117 hours.\n\nMethod 3\n\nCalculate 8% of the hours you worked in the leave year, subject to a maximum of 4 working weeks.\n\nWhen calculating your holiday entitlement, your employer should include all the hours you worked, including time spent on annual leave, maternity leave, parental leave, force majeure leave, adoptive leave or the first 13 weeks of carer\u2019s leave.\n\nIf you have worked for at least 8 months, you are entitled to an unbroken period of 2 weeks' annual leave. This means you can get 2 weeks off in a row.\n\nHoliday pay\n\nHoliday pay (pay for annual leave) must be paid in advance at your normal weekly rate .\n\nIf your pay changes from week-to-week (for example, because of commission or bonus payments), your holiday pay is the average of your pay over the 13 weeks before you take holidays.\n\nPart-time employees\n\nGenerally, annual leave for part-time workers is calculated using Method 3 above. This means you can get 8% of your hours worked.\n\nIf you work full time for some months and part-time for the rest of the year, you should calculate the leave for the full-time and the part-time periods of work separately.\n\nAgency employees\n\nIf you are an agency worker, the party who pays your wages (employment agency or client company) is the employer for the purposes of the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997 , and is responsible for providing your annual leave entitlement.\n\nCan my employer force me to take annual leave?\n\nUsually, employees can ask to take annual leave at specific times. Your employer can accept your request, or refuse your request.\n\nYour employer decides when annual leave may be taken, but this is subject to a number of conditions. Your employer must:\n\nTake into account your family responsibilities, as well as the available opportunities for rest and recreation.\n\nDiscuss your annual leave with you (or your union) at least one month before you are to take the leave.\n\nCan I \u2018carry over\u2019 annual leave to next year?\n\nAnnual leave should be taken within the leave year (see above). Depending on your employer, you can agree to take your annual leave within 6 months of the relevant leave year.Document 1:::\nYou must be paid at your normal daily rate of pay . Your employer should not make any reference to domestic violence leave on your payslip.\n\nWhat is normal daily pay?\n\nYour normal daily pay includes any regular bonus or allowance which does not change from week to week (but excludes overtime or commission).\n\nIf your pay changes from week to week , your pay for domestic violence leave is the average of your pay over the 13 weeks before you are on leave. This could be, for example, because of regular bonus payments or allowances.\n\nHow to apply\n\nCheck if your employer has a workplace domestic violence policy and follow the process to apply for the leave and other supports available.\n\nDo I need to give notice to my employer?\n\nYou do not have to give your employer notice to take domestic violence leave in emergency circumstances.\n\nYou should give notice if you are able to, or as soon as you practically can after taking it.\n\nDisclosing your experience to your employer\n\nGetting support from your employer means you need to disclose your experience to someone at work. In most jobs, employees usually tell their direct manager about absences.\n\nOr, your employer may assign a specific or designated person to handle matters related to domestic violence leave and other available support. The designated person could be a HR manager or the business owner.\n\nYour employer should make sure the designated person is well-trained to handle employee disclosures properly.\n\nCan my employer ask for proof?\n\nYou are not required to give your employer any supporting information or evidence when requesting domestic violence leave.\n\nThere might be exceptional situations where your employer could ask for supporting documents, but this would be rare and is not in line with the intentions of the law.\n\nConfidentiality\n\nYour employer should treat any information you disclose about domestic violence with the utmost sensitivity and confidentiality.\n\nThey should only share the information with those who need it for safety plans or administering domestic violence leave. Ideally, your employer should get your written permission before sharing any information.\n\nSharing information does not always mean breaking confidentiality. Your employer can find ways to share details without revealing your identity or the fact that you disclosed domestic violence.\n\nYour employment rights\n\nIn general, you will be treated as if you are in work during domestic violence leave.\n\nThis means:\n\nYour time on domestic violence leave does not break your continuous service. It also counts as service when calculating entitlements such as annual leave and public holidays.\n\nYou must not be dismissed for taking or asking to take domestic violence leave.Document 2:::\nEnglish | Gaeilge\n\nYou are here: Home > Employment > Employment rights and conditions > Leave and holidays > Other types of leave from work\n\nOther types of leave from work\n\nTaking time off work\n\nForce majeure leave\n\nLeave for medical care\n\nCompassionate leave\n\nJury service\n\nCareer break or study leave\n\nHow to make a complaint\n\nMore information\n\nTaking time off work\n\nThere are different reasons you might need time off work, for example:\n\nIf you have a family crisis, like a sudden illness in your family\n\nIf you are called for jury service\n\nIf you want to take study leave or a career break\n\nIn some cases, you are entitled to be paid for your leave, but in others you are not.\n\nYou may also want to read about types of statutory leave from work, including:\n\nAnnual leave\n\nPublic holidays\n\nSick leave\n\nMaternity leave\n\nPaternity leave\n\nAdoptive leave\n\nCarer\u2019s leave\n\nParental leave\n\nParent's leave\n\nLeave for medical care\n\nDomestic violence leave\n\nForce majeure leave\n\nIf you have a family crisis, you have a right to limited time off work. This is called force majeure leave .\n\nYou may need to take force majeure leave for an urgent family reason, such as the unexpected injury or illness of a \u2018close family member\u2019.\n\nA close family member includes:\n\nYour child (including an adopted child)\n\nYour spouse or partner\n\nYour parent or grandparent\n\nYour sibling\n\nSomeone who you have a duty of care for (for example, you are acting in place of a parent, also known as loco parentis )\n\nSomeone who depends on you for care (known as \u2018domestic dependency\u2019)\n\nOther people as defined by law\n\nIf a close family member has died, you do not have an entitlement to force majeure leave. Instead, you may be able to take \u2018compassionate leave\u2019 \u2013 read more about compassionate leave below.\n\nTaking force majeure leave\n\nYou can take force majeure leave of one or more days up to a maximum of:\n\n3 days in 12 consecutive months, or\n\nA total of 5 days in 36 consecutive months (3 years)\n\nDepending on your employer and your contract of employment, you may be able to take more than this.\n\nQuestion: Can my employer force me to take annual leave?\n\nBegin by enclosing all thoughts within <thinking> tags, exploring multiple angles and approaches.

            "raw_answer": "Use the following pieces of context to reason step by step before answering the question.\n\n\nExtracted documents:\nDocument 0:::\nOr your employer can treat you as not being on sick leave on the public holiday and pay you as normal for that day. In this case, they will not count the public holiday as a sick leave day.\n\nYou work part-time\n\nIf you work part-time and you are on sick leave during a public holiday, you are entitled to time off work for the public holiday. You must have worked at least 40 hours over the previous 5 weeks.\n\nExceptions\n\nYou are not entitled to pay or time off for the public holiday if you are on sick leave immediately before the public holiday, and either of the following apply:\n\nYou have been off work for more than 26 weeks due to an ordinary illness or an accident\n\nYou have been off work for more than 52 weeks due to an occupational accident\n\nWhat happens to my annual leave when I am off sick?\n\nIf you are sick during your annual leave and get a medical certificate for those days, they will not be counted as annual leave days. Your employer cannot insist you take annual leave on days you are off sick and have a medical certificate.\n\nYou can continue to build up your annual leave entitlement while you are off sick, once you have a medical certificate.\n\nIf you are on long-term sick leave and cannot take your annual leave due to illness, you can carry it over for up to 15 months after the end of the year you built it up. If you leave your job within these 15 months, you should get holiday pay instead of the annual leave days you could not take due to illness.\n\nIf I take sick leave while on probation\n\nYour employer can suspend your probation, training or apprenticeship for the period you are on sick leave.

The period of the tenancy may be weekly or monthly, depending on how often the rent is due. Periodic tenancy agreements may or may not be in writing.\n\nYour landlord can end the tenancy at any time during the first 6 months of the tenancy without having to give a reason, but, in general, you will get security of tenure after 6 months \u2013 see \u2018Part 4 tenancy\u2019 below. You must always get a valid written notice of termination and there are rules about how much notice you must be given, depending on the length of the tenancy (with some exceptions). Read more in our page If your landlord wants you to leave .\n\nAs a tenant, you can end the periodic tenancy at any time. You do not have to give a reason. Again, there are rules about notice periods and what constitutes a valid notice of termination \u2013 see \u2018Ending your tenancy\u2019 below.\n\nClaiming a Part 4 tenancy at the end of a fixed-term lease\n\nIf you have a fixed-term contract or lease and you want to remain in the property under a Part 4 tenancy, you should notify your landlord of your intention to stay in the property. You should do this between 3 months and 1 month before your fixed\u2013term tenancy or lease agreement expires.\n\nIf you do not notify your landlord, you cannot be refused coverage under Part 4, but you may have to compensate the landlord for any financial loss that they have because you did not notify them of your intention to remain in the tenancy.\n\nEnding your tenancy\n\nThe following section outlines what a tenant must do to end a tenancy. There are different rules for landlords who want to end a tenancy . The RTB also has information on their website about how a tenant can end a tenancy .\n\nFormat of termination notice\n\nAs a tenant, you can terminate your tenancy (whether fixed-term or periodic) without giving a reason, but you must give a valid notice of termination to your landlord. In order to be valid, this notice must:\n\nBe in writing\n\nBe signed by you\n\nSpecify the date that you are serving it on the landlord\n\nSpecify the termination date of the tenancy (you have the full 24 hours of this date to vacate possession)Document 1:::\nYou do not have security of tenure . This came in under the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2019 (pdf) .\n\nYou cannot be forced to pay for student-specific accommodation during the summer when you don\u2019t need it. Your tenancy or licence arrangement should not be more than 41 weeks, unless you ask for longer. If your landlord does not comply with the 41-week rule you should contact to the RTB, who can sanction your landlord. This rule came in under the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2024 and applies to tenancies and licence arrangements in student-specific accommodation created from 20 July 2024.\n\nYou only need to give your landlord 28 days\u2019 notice when ending a tenancy. You can give your landlord more notice if you want and your landlord must give you more. This came in under the Residential Tenancies (No. 2) Act 2021 .\n\nYou can terminate your fixed-term tenancy any time between 1 May and 1 October each year for any reason. But, outside of these dates, the existing rules about ending a fixed-term tenancy apply and you can only terminate your tenancy for specific reasons. This rule came in under the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2024 .\n\nFind out more about your rights as a tenant in student-specific accommodation on the RTB\u2019s website .\n\nSecurity of tenure\n\nSecurity of tenure is a tenant\u2019s right to stay in rented accommodation for a set amount of time. Generally, security of tenure applies automatically when you have been renting for 6 months and haven\u2019t received a valid notice of termination from your landlord in that time. When you have security of tenure, your landlord can only terminate your tenancy for a limited number of reasons, see our page \u2018 If your landlord wants you to leave \u2019.\n\nThe amount of time you are entitled to stay in rented accommodation after the first 6 months depends on when your tenancy began.\n\nIf your tenancy was created after 10 June 2022 , you have a tenancy of unlimited duration. This means if you have rented somewhere for 6 months, you have the right to stay in that accommodation indefinitely (no end date), unless the landlord wants to terminate your tenancy for one of the allowed reasons.Document 2:::\nIf this is not done, the notice of termination is invalid. The RTB recommends that landlords use certified post when posting the notice of termination to the tenant and the RTB, and that they keep proof of this.\n\nWhen the RTB receives the notice of termination it will:\n\nWrite to you and your landlord about the RTB services and outline your rights and responsibilities under residential tenancies legislation\n\nAsk for your contact details in case the landlord needs them to offer the property back to you. This will only be done with your consent\n\nThis requirement is in place since 6 July 2022, when it was brought in under the Regulation of Providers of Building Works and Miscellaneous Provisions Act 2022.\n\nThe RTB's website has more information about these changes .\n\nWhat is a valid notice of termination?\n\nThe law sets out the requirements for a valid notice of termination. It must:\n\nBe in writing (an email is not sufficient)\n\nBe signed by the landlord (or an authorised agent)\n\nSpecify the date of termination of the tenancy\n\nState that you have the whole 24 hours of the termination date to vacate the property\n\nSpecify the date of the notice itself\n\nState the reason for termination, if a tenancy has lasted more than 6 months or is a fixed-term tenancy. (This does not have to be included for tenancies in student-specific accommodation.)\n\nState that any issue about the validity of the notice or the right of the landlord to serve it must be referred to the RTB within 90 days from the receipt of the notice. (This 90-day timeframe applies unless the tenant is in breach of their obligations.)\n\nYour landlord must give additional details in certain situations and, in some cases, a statutory declaration. The information below describes the additional details needed for each of the valid reasons for terminating your tenancy. The RTB also provides sample notices of termination , with the details required in each situation.\n\nIf the property is being sold\n\nIf your landlord intends to sell the property within 9 months of the terminating your tenancy, the notice of termination must state that:\n\n\u201cThe reason for the termination of the tenancy is due to the fact that the landlord intends to sell the dwelling, for full consideration, within 9 months after the termination of the tenancy\u201d.\n\nQuestion: What is a valid reason for ending a tenancy after the first 6 months?\n\nBegin by enclosing all thoughts within <thinking> tags, exploring multiple angles and approaches.

There are different types of domestic adoption:\n\nStep-parent adoption\n\nStep-parent adoption is where you apply to adopt your partner\u2019s child.\n\nYour partner can consent (agree) to the adoption and still keep their own parental rights and responsibilities. In a step-parent adoption, you and your partner share parenting duties once the adoption order is made. Read about adoption orders in the section \u2018Steps involved in adopting a child\u2019, below.\n\nThe child must have lived with their parent and you (the prospective step- parent) together, for a minimum of 2 years .\n\nExtended family adoption\n\nAn extended family adoption is where a member of the child\u2019s family (or a relative), adopts the child. The child would have been placed with them by the birth mother or by the Tusla childcare system.\n\nDomestic infant adoption\n\nDomestic infant adoption is where a child is placed with an alternative set of parents. The child is placed with the couple by the Tusla adoption service or an accredited adoption agency. The Adoption Authority of Ireland must approve the placement before it takes place.\n\nLong term foster care adoption\n\nFoster care adoption is when a couple adopt a child who was originally placed with them in a foster care situation.\n\nFind more information on the different types of domestic adoption on the Adoption Authority of Ireland\u2019s website.\n\nWho can adopt a child in Ireland?Document 1:::\nEnglish | Gaeilge\n\nYou are here: Home > Family and Relationships > Adoption, fostering and surrogacy > Intercountry adoption\n\nIntercountry adoption\n\nWhat is intercountry adoption?\n\nWho can adopt?\n\nBeing assessed for eligibility to adopt\n\nChoosing a country to adopt from\n\nThe process of intercountry adoption\n\nGetting immigration clearance for the child\n\nSteps to take once the child arrives in Ireland\n\nMore information about intercountry adoption\n\nWhat is intercountry adoption?\n\nIf you adopt a child who lives in a country outside Ireland, the process is called intercountry adoption. If you adopt a child who is resident in Ireland, it is called domestic adoption .\n\nWhen you adopt a child, they become a member of your family. Adoption creates a legal relationship between the adoptive parents and the child.\n\nAs intercountry adoption is a complex legal process, you should get legal advice from a solicitor who specialises in intercountry adoption. See 'More information about intercountry adoption' below.\n\nWho can adopt?\n\nYou must be at least 21 years of age to adopt a child under Irish law. There is no Irish legal upper age limit for adopting parents but age is a factor in determining suitability here.\n\nYou must also:\n\nHave a valid 'declaration of eligibility and suitability' (see 'Being assessed for eligibility to adopt' below)\n\nBe \u2018habitually resident in the State\u2019, which means Ireland has become your home. Living in Ireland for at least one year before the date of the making of the adoption order would generally be sufficient.\n\nYour relationship status does not necessarily impact your eligibility to adopt a child. This means you are eligible to adopt if you are:\n\nA married couple\n\nA couple living together in a civil partnership\n\nA couple cohabiting together in a relationship for at least 3 years (living together but not married or in a civil partnership)\n\nA sole applicant who is not in one of the categories listed above (only where the Adoption Authority is satisfied that, in the particular circumstances of the case, it is desirable and in the best interests of the child)\n\nYou may also be eligible to adopt if you are the mother, father or relative of the child. \u2018Relative\u2019 means a grandparent, brother, sister, uncle or aunt of the child (or the spouse of any such person), with the relationship to the child being traced through either the mother or the father.Document 2:::\nTo request an Immigration Clearance Letter, you need to write to:\n\nForeign Adoptions Unit\n\nUnit 3 Domestic Residence & Permissions Division\n\n4th floor\n\nImmigration Service Delivery\n\nDepartment of Justice\n\n13-14 Burgh Quay\n\nDublin 2\n\nD02 XK70\n\nYou must include:\n\nA letter of application, with a daytime contact number\n\nA photocopy of the passport of each adopter\n\nTwo passport size photographs of each adopter\n\nThe original Declaration of Eligibility and Suitability (not a copy)\n\nA letter from the Adoption Authority stating how many children you are eligible to adopt and from what country\n\nThese documents will be returned to you with your Immigration Clearance Letter, when approved. You will need to show this letter to an immigration officer when you return to Ireland.\n\nSteps to take once the child arrives in Ireland\n\nTell the Adoption Authority that the child has arrived\n\nYou must tell the Adoption Authority of Ireland and Tusla when you bring the child to Ireland for the first time after adoption in the country of origin.

This is the formal, legal recognition of the adoption by the Irish State.\n\nYou must complete and submit an application for registration of the adoption (pdf) to the Adoption Authority within 3 months of re-entering Ireland following the adoption.\n\nThe Adoption Authority can register the adoption in the \u2018Register of Intercountry Adoptions\u2019, on the basis of an \u2018Article 23 certificate\u2019. An Article 23 certificate is a certificate of assurance from the child\u2019s country of origin that proves the adoption was carried out in compliance with the Hague Convention.\n\nGetting an adoption certificate\n\nWhen the adoption has been registered, it will appear on the Register of Intercountry Adoptions. The register has details of the adopted child and the adoptive parents. It is a public register and is open to scrutiny by members of the public.\n\nQuestion: Who can adopt a child in Ireland?\n\nBegin by enclosing all thoughts within <thinking> tags, exploring multiple angles and approaches.

If you commit a motoring offence , and the penalty for the offence includes penalty points, your driving licence will be endorsed with one or more penalty points.\n\nSome traffic offences have other penalties, such as fines as well as penalty points.\n\nThe penalty points system for driving offences has operated in Ireland since 2002. The law governing penalty points is the Road Traffic Act 2002 . This legislation has been amended a number of times to add offences for which penalty points can be issued.\n\nWhile penalty points are endorsed on your driving licence, the points do not physically appear on the licence. Your penalty points are recorded on your driving licence record, which is held on the National Vehicle and Driver File operated by the Department of Transport.\n\nPenalty point endorsements remain on your licence record for 3 years and must be notified to your insurance company when applying for motor insurance. Motor insurance companies have had access to the National Vehicle and Driver File since 2014.\n\nEndorsements on your licence record will often lead to an increase in your motor insurance premium.\n\nHow do penalty points work?\n\nPenalty points are recorded on your driving licence when:\n\nYou are convicted in court of a driving offence that attracts penalty points or\n\nYou pay a fixed charge notice that was issued to you for an offence that also carries penalty points\n\nIf you get 12 penalty points in any 3 year period, you are automatically disqualified from driving for 6 months.\n\nLearner permit drivers are disqualified if they have 7 penalty points.

If you have been caught speeding on a police traffic camera, you will get a notice of your fine and penalty points for the offence by post. You have 28 days in which to pay your fine from the date the notice is issued to you. If you do not pay your fine, the fine then increases to \u20ac240, which you must pay within 28 days. If after this time (56 days) you still have not paid your fine, the offence is referred to the courts. If you are convicted in court of speeding offences and non-payment of fines, you will automatically receive 5 penalty points and a fine up to a maximum of \u20ac1,000.\n\nSeatbelt offences : If you drive without a seatbelt or allow children under 17 years to travel in your car without a seatbelt, you will incur a fixed charge fine of \u20ac120. You must pay this fine within 28 days or face an increased fine of \u20ac180 payable within 56 days of the offence. 3 penalty points will be added to your licence if you pay the fine on time. If you are convicted in court for non-wearing of a seatbelt, 5 penalty points will be added to your licence and you will be liable to a \u20ac2,000 fine for a first offence. Read more about seatbelts and the law in Ireland .\n\nMotor insurance offences : If you drive without insurance, you will get 5 penalty points and will have to appear in court. The court can issue a fine of up to \u20ac5,000 and can send you to prison for up to 6 months. The court can disqualify you from driving instead of issuing penalty points.\n\nCareless driving : If you drive \u2018a vehicle in a public place without due care and attention' you can get up to 5 penalty points on your licence and a fine of up to \u20ac5,000.

Here's how it works:\n\n1.  **Fixed Charge Fines**: If you receive a fixed charge notice, you will be issued a notice by the Department of Transport. If you pay the fine within 56 days, you will get a further notice from the Department of Transport confirming that the penalty points will be added to your driving license. The penalty points will be added to your license 28 days after that.\n2.  **Summon to Court**: If you do not pay the fixed charge fine within 56 days, you will get a summons to appear in the District Court. If you are convicted of a driving offense in court, the court will notify the Department of Transport of the number of penalty points attached to that conviction. The Department of Transport will then issue a notification that these penalty points will be added to your driving license 28 days after the notification date.\n3.  **Penalty Points Remain**: Penalty points remain on your license record for 3 years. Any period where your license is out of date or you are serving a court disqualification does not count as part of the 3 years.\n4.  **Disqualification**: If you accumulate 12 points or 7 where applicable and are disqualified from driving for 6 months, the points which led to the disqualification are removed at the end of the 6 months.\n5.  **License Surrender**: If you have been notified by the Department of Transport that you have been disqualified from driving because you have reached 12 penalty points or more, you must surrender your driving license to the National Driver License Service for the period of 6 months.\n6.  **Motoring Offenses**: The Road Traffic Act 2002 legislates for motoring offenses that incur penalty points. The Road Safety Authority maintains an up-to-date list of penalty point motoring offenses.\n\n<reflection> The penalty points system in Ireland is a complex process that involves multiple steps and timelines.

However, it does explain the concept of continuous employment and reckonable service separately.\n\nContinuous employment refers to the length of time an individual has been employed in a job, which counts towards qualifying for redundancy. According to Document 0, an individual needs 104 weeks of continuous employment to qualify for redundancy.\n\nReckonable service, on the other hand, is the amount of service that an individual is eligible to receive redundancy pay for. The documents do not explicitly state that continuous employment and reckonable service are the same, but it can be inferred that they are related. Reckonable service is calculated based on an individual's length of service, which is a measure of continuous employment.\n\nGiven the information provided, it appears that continuous employment and reckonable service are not the same but are related concepts. Continuous employment is a prerequisite for qualifying for redundancy, and reckonable service is a measure of the length of service that an individual is eligible to receive redundancy pay for. Therefore, the answer to the question is that continuous employment and reckonable service are not the same but are related concepts.\n\n<reflection> The provided information does not directly answer the question, but it provides a clear explanation of the concepts of continuous employment and reckonable service.

This means that if you have a pre-nuptial agreement in place and you end up in court following the breakdown of your marriage, the judge is not bound by the terms of the pre-nuptial agreement. The only provision in Irish law is under sections 113 and 113A of the Succession Act 1965 (as amended) where a spouse or a civil partner can renounce his/her legal right share in a pre-nuptial agreement.

As a result, they are not strictly binding. This means that if you have a pre-nuptial agreement in place and you end up in court following the breakdown of your marriage, the judge is not bound by the terms of the pre-nuptial agreement.\n\nThe only provision in Irish law is under sections 113 and 113A of the Succession Act 1965 (as amended) where a spouse or a civil partner can renounce his/her legal right share in a pre-nuptial agreement.\n\nAlthough they are not legally binding, there is nothing in Irish law which stops a couple planning to marry from having and signing a pre-nuptial agreement.

Therefore, in situations where one party is likely to inherit a significant family farm or business, it will guide the judge in the divorce or judicial separation on what the parties\u2019 intentions were at the outset.\n\nDrafting a pre-nuptial agreement\n\nOnly pre-nuptial agreements entered into following independent legal advice for both parties are likely to be taken into account. The court would have to be satisfied that there had been a complete disclosure of assets before the agreement was signed. It is also advisable for the agreement to provide for reviews:\n\nPeriodically (for example, every five years)\n\nIf children are born\n\nIf there is a major change in circumstances (for example, assets are purchased or sold)\n\nThe agreement should be in writing, be signed by each party and comply with the rules of contract law.\n\nThe future of pre-nuptial agreementsDocument 1:::\nYou must notify the personal representative of the deceased of your application for provision from the deceased\u2019s estate within 6 months of an application for a grant of probate .\n\nIn general, if your cohabiting relationship ended two years or more before your ex-partner died, you cannot apply for provision from the estate unless you were getting regular or periodic payments from the deceased.\n\nWhat is a cohabitation agreement?\n\nIf you live with your partner but you do not intend to marry, you should protect your financial interests by entering into a \u2018 cohabitation agreement \u2019 (also called a cohabitant\u2019s agreement). This is a voluntary, signed agreement, which allows you to specify the day-to-day joint financial arrangements of your relationship, such as:\n\nThe payment of joint debts\n\nThe payment of common household expenses\n\nYou can also specify how you plan to separate your assets, such as shared property, should the relationship come to an end. In the event of a break-up, a cohabitation agreement can make the division of your assets more straightforward.\n\nYour cohabitation agreement may include a provision that the redress scheme does not apply to you (for example, you can both agree not to apply for a maintenance order should your relationship end). This is different from similar agreements by married couples. Agreements between married couples cannot exclude either party\u2019s right to apply to the courts for various orders (for example, a maintenance order).\n\nIs a cohabitation agreement valid in court?\n\nIf you and your partner make a cohabitation agreement (an agreement on joint financial matters), it is only valid if:\n\nEach of you has had independent legal advice, or you got legal advice together and have waived the right to independent legal advice (see \u2018More information\u2019 below)\n\nThe agreement is a contract\n\nThe agreement has been signed by each of you\n\nIn exceptional circumstances, the court may set aside or vary (change) your cohabitation agreement (for example, if the enforcement of the agreement would cause serious injustice).\n\nIf you and your cohabitant entered into an agreement before the 2010 Act commenced, it is enforceable.\n\nMore information\n\nIf you are concerned about your rights following the breakdown of your cohabiting relationship, you should get legal advice.Document 2:::\nYour executor must inform your spouse or civil partner in writing of their right to choose between these two options. Your spouse or civil partner must ask for their legal right share within 6 months of being notified, or within 12 months of the taking out of the Grant of Representation.\n\nWhere a legal right share does not apply\n\nYour spouse or civil partner can renounce (give up) their rights to the legal right share. This can be part of an agreement before marriage or civil partnership or the spouse or civil partner can give up their rights to benefit their children or other named beneficiaries.\n\nIf there is evidence of undue influence or evidence that the spouse or civil partner did not understand what they were doing, the renunciation may be challenged. It is normally advised that a spouse or civil partner get independent legal advice if renouncing their legal right share.\n\nThe legal right share can be lost where the spouse or civil partner is:\n\nConvicted of the murder, manslaughter or attempted murder of the deceased person\n\nConvicted of an offence against the deceased person or a child that carries a sentence of more than 2 years\n\nDivorce, separation and desertion\n\nSeparation agreements usually include a renunciation of both spouses\u2019 or civil partner\u2019s legal right share.\n\nIf you are divorced or your civil partnership was dissolved, you do not have to provide a legal right share.\n\nIf your spouse or civil partner deserted you for more than 2 years, they are not entitled to a legal right share unless they deserted you as a result of your behaviour (for example, domestic abuse).\n\nCohabiting partners\n\nPartners, who live with each other but are not married or in a civil partnership, have no automatic legal right to each other's estates, although under the redress scheme for cohabiting couples introduced by the Civil Partnership and Certain Rights and Obligations of Cohabitants Act 2010 a qualified cohabitant can apply for a share of the estate of a deceased cohabitant.\n\nYou can leave some or all of your estate to your partner but this does not cancel out the legal rights of a spouse or civil partner if you were married before to someone else and did not get divorced or had your civil partnership dissolved.\n\nRights of children under a will\n\nChildren do not have any absolute right to inherit any of their parent's estate if the parent has made a will. Children born inside or outside marriage and adopted children all have the same rights and there are no age restrictions.\n\nQuestion: What is the legal status of pre-nuptial agreements?\n\nBegin by enclosing all thoughts within <thinking> tags, exploring multiple angles and approaches.

However, the Department of Transport is mentioned as the primary regulator of air transport, including commercial and private services. The Irish Aviation Authority (IAA) is also mentioned as the single national aviation regulator responsible for safety, security, and consumer protection functions. AirNav Ireland is a new semi-state company that looks after air navigation and air traffic management and related services functions. Considering the context, it appears that the IAA is the primary regulator of aviation in Ireland, but AirNav Ireland also plays a significant role in air navigation and air traffic management. The Department of Transport regulates air transport, but it does not seem to be the primary regulator of aviation. Therefore, the correct answer is the Irish Aviation Authority (IAA) and AirNav Ireland.</reflection>\n\n<reward>0.9</reward>\n\n<step>Step 1: Review the provided context to identify the entities involved in regulating aviation in Ireland.</step>\n<count>9.9</count>\n\n<reflection>This step was straightforward, and the entities involved in regulating aviation in Ireland are clearly mentioned in the context. However, it's essential to carefully evaluate the information and consider the roles of each entity. The Department of Transport regulates air transport, but it's not explicitly stated as the primary regulator of aviation. The IAA and AirNav Ireland are mentioned as separate entities with distinct responsibilities. Therefore, it's crucial to analyze the information carefully to determine the correct answer.</reflection>\n<reward>0.8</reward>\n\n<step>Step 2: Analyze the roles of each entity involved in regulating aviation in Ireland.</step>\n<count>9.8</count>\n\n<reflection>Upon analyzing the roles of each entity, it becomes clear that the IAA is responsible for safety, security, and consumer protection functions, making it a strong candidate for the primary regulator of aviation. AirNav Ireland's role in air navigation and air traffic management also suggests that it plays a significant role in regulating aviation. However, the Department of Transport's regulation of air transport is not explicitly stated as the primary regulator. Therefore, it's essential to consider the IAA's responsibilities and AirNav Ireland's role in air navigation and air traffic management when determining the correct answer.</",
