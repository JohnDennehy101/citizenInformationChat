A key consideration is the type of tenant. The Fair Housing Act prohibits landlords from discriminating against tenants based on certain characteristics. One such characteristic is the tenant's immigration status. If the tenant is a non-resident alien or non-immigrant alien, the landlord may have grounds to terminate the tenancy. This is because such tenants are not eligible to become permanent residents and do not have the same rights as U.S. citizens or permanent residents.\n\nStep 1: Identify the key factors that influence a landlord's ability to terminate",

The number of points assigned depends on the severity of the offense. For example, if a driver is pulled over for speeding, they may receive 2-3 points for a minor infraction. For more serious offenses, such as reckless driving or driving under the influence, the penalty can be as high as 10 points or more. The points are kept on file for a certain period, usually 3-5 years, and can be used to determine if a driver has accumulated enough points to have their license suspended or revoked.\n\n<reflection> I realize now that I didn't provide enough context for the question.

This means that if you have a pre-nuptial agreement in place and you end up in court following the breakdown of your marriage, the judge is not bound by the terms of the pre-nuptial agreement. The only provision in Irish law is under sections 113 and 113A of the Succession Act 1965 (as amended) where a spouse or a civil partner can renounce his/her legal right share in a pre-nuptial agreement. Although they are not legally binding, there is nothing in Irish law which stops a couple planning to marry from having and signing a pre-nuptial agreement. Importantly, such agreements can serve as guides for the courts in judicial separation and divorce cases. If a pre-nuptial agreement makes \u2018proper provision\u2019 for each person it is more likely to be persuasive on the judge.

To determine the operating hours and frequency of the Luas, I will break down the process into steps and evaluate the information available.\n\n<step> Step 1: Research the Luas website or official social media channels for operating hours and frequency information. \n<count> 9/10\n\n<reflection> Reward score: 0.9. The Luas website is a good starting point, but I should also check for any updates or changes to the operating hours and frequency.\n\n<thinking> I'll also consider contacting Luas customer service or checking with local transit authorities for the most up-to-date information.\n\n<step> Step 2: Review the Luas website and social media",

Break down the solution into clear steps within <step> tags. Start with a 10-step budget, requesting more for complex problems if needed. Use <count> tags after each step to show the remaining budget. Stop when reaching 0. Continuously adjust your reasoning based on intermediate results and reflections, adapting your strategy as you progress. Regularly evaluate progress using <reflection> tags. Be critical and honest about your reasoning process. Assign a quality score between 0.0 and 1.0 using <reward> tags after each reflection. Use this to guide your approach: 0.8+: Continue current approach 0.5-0.7: Consider minor adjustments Below 0.5: Seriously consider backtracking and trying a different approach If unsure or if reward score is low, backtrack and try a different approach, explaining your decision within <thinking> tags. Explore multiple solutions individually if possible, comparing approaches in reflections. Use thoughts as a scratchpad, writing out all calculations and reasoning explicitly.
