The only provision in Irish law is under sections 113 and 113A of the Succession Act 1965 (as amended) where a spouse or a civil partner can renounce his/her legal right share in a pre-nuptial agreement. Although they are not legally binding, there is nothing in Irish law which stops a couple planning to marry from having and signing a pre-nuptial agreement.

This gives us one main period where we can find consistent operation throughout most days but also potential gaps during weekends.\n\nI should check online resources for current real-time schedule updates which might offer specific details such as morning peak hour services versus off-peak ones.\n\nNext up: To get accurate hourly frequency data across weekdays and weekend mornings/even",
