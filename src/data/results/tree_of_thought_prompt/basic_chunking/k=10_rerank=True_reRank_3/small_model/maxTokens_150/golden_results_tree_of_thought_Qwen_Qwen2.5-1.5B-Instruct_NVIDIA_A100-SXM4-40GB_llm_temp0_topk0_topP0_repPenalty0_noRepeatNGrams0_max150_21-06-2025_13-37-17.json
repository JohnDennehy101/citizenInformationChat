It allows individuals to receive free or subsidized treatment without having to pay upfront costs at hospitals, clinics, pharmacies, or other health facilities. Medical cards are often linked to personal identification numbers or social security numbers, making them convenient for tracking benefits and entitlements related to healthcare access. They can also be used for various administrative tasks such as renewing prescriptions or registering for health programs.

This means that if you have a pre-nuptial agreement in place and you end up in court following the breakdown of your marriage, the judge is not bound by the terms of the pre-nuptial agreement. The only provision in Irish law is under sections 113 and 113A of the Succession Act 1965 (as amended) where a spouse or a civil partner can renounce his/her legal right share in a pre-nuptial agreement. Although they are not legally binding, there is nothing in Irish law which stops a couple planning to marry from having and signing a pre-nuptial agreement. Importantly, such agreements can serve as guides for the courts in judicial separation and divorce cases. If a pre-nuptial agreement makes \u2018proper provision\u2019 for each person it is more likely to be persuasive on the judge.
