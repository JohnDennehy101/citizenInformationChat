This means that if you have a pre-nuptial agreement in place and you end up in court following the breakdown of your marriage, the judge is not bound by the terms of the pre-nuptial agreement. The only provision in Irish law is under sections 113 and 113A of the Succession Act 1965 (as amended) where a spouse or a civil partner can renounce his/her legal right share in a pre-nuptial agreement. Although they are not legally binding, there is nothing in Irish law which stops a couple planning to marry from having and signing a pre-nuptial agreement. Importantly, such agreements can serve as guides for the courts in judicial separation and divorce cases. If a pre-nuptial agreement makes \u2018proper provision\u2019 for each person it is more likely to be persuasive on the judge.

In some cases, courts may interpret pre-nuptial agreements differently from their plain meaning due to potential issues like undue influence or lack of consideration. This makes it important for individuals considering such agreements to consult with legal experts familiar with local laws and practices. There are also ethical concerns about using pre-nuptial agreements in situations where one party might be at a significant disadvantage, which could affect how they are viewed by courts.

It runs every hour on most routes during peak times but less frequently outside those periods. The exact schedule can vary depending on traffic conditions and route length. For detailed information, passengers should check the official Luas website or use the Luas app which provides real-time updates.\n\nTo summarize:\nOperating Hours: Mon-Fri, Sat-Sun (except public holidays)\nFrequency: Typically every hour during peak times, less often outside these periods\n\nLet me break down my thinking further:\n\n1. **Monday to Friday**: This represents the standard working week. While some services might be adjusted due to holidays, they still operate under normal",
