When a driver commits certain infractions during a race, they accumulate penalty time which affects their finishing position at the end of the race. Each type of infraction results in specific penalty times:\n\n1) Yellow Flag Penalty Time = 2 minutes  \n2) Red Flag Penalties = Up to a maximum of 4 minutes \n3) DNF = Driver Not Finished = Race Result Void\n\nThe goal for drivers is to minimize their total accumulated penalty penalties over the course of several races. This can be achieved by carefully planning pit stops, selecting appropriate race strategies, and making strategic decisions about when to take risks versus avoid them.\n\n",

This means that if you have a pre-nuptial agreement in place and you end up in court following the breakdown of your marriage, the judge is not bound by the terms of the pre-nuptial agreement. The only provision in Irish law is under sections 113 and 113A of the Succession Act 1965 (as amended) where a spouse or a civil partner can renounce his/her legal right share in a pre-nuptial agreement. Although they are not legally binding, there is nothing in Irish law which stops a couple planning to marry from having and signing a pre-nuptial agreement. Importantly, such agreements can serve as guides for the courts in judicial separation and divorce cases. If a pre-nuptial agreement makes \u2018proper provision\u2019 for each person it is more likely to be persuasive on the judge.
