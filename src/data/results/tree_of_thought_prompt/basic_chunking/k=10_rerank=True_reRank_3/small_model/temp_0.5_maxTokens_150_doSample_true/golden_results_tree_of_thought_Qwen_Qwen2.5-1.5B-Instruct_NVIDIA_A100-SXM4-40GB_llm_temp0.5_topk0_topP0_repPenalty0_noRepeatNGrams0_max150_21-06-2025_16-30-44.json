It allows these caregivers to take a break from their caregiving duties while still receiving support and assistance when needed. This can be crucial for maintaining both the health and well-being of the caregiver and those they care for.\n\nBranch 1: Understanding the purpose of respite care\n- The primary goal of respite care is to give caregivers a break from their caregiving responsibilities.\n- By doing so, it helps prevent burnout and ensures continued effective care for those needing long-term support.\n- Respite care also provides flexibility for caregivers to manage other aspects of their lives, such as work or personal commitments.\n\nBranch",

This means that if you have a pre-nuptial agreement in place and you end up in court following the breakdown of your marriage, the judge is not bound by the terms of the pre-nuptial agreement. The only provision in Irish law is under sections 113 and 113A of the Succession Act 1965 (as amended) where a spouse or a civil partner can renounce his/her legal right share in a pre-nuptial agreement. Although they are not legally binding, there is nothing in Irish law which stops a couple planning to marry from having and signing a pre-nuptial agreement. Importantly, such agreements can serve as guides for the courts in judicial separation and divorce cases. If a pre-nuptial agreement makes \u2018proper provision\u2019 for each person it is more likely to be persuasive on the judge.

For example, routes like Dublin Busway operate from 6am until midnight, while some suburban routes might run less frequently during peak times. To determine exact operating hours for specific routes, one would need to check the official Luas timetable or contact customer service directly. Let me explore how these hours vary across different types of Luas services.\n</thinking>\n\n<branch id=\"operating_hours\">\n  <step>\n    <p>The Luas operates daily.</p>\n    <p>This includes weekends and public holidays.</p>\n  </step>\n  \n  <step>\n    <p>Routes like the Dublin Busway operate continuously throughout the day.</",
