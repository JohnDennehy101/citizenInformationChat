It involves temporary arrangements where a professional caregiver takes over the caregiving duties while the primary caregiver rests or attends to other responsibilities. This allows the primary caregiver to take a break from caregiving tasks such as meal preparation, medication management, personal hygiene, and emotional support. The goal of respite care is to help prevent burnout among caregivers and ensure their well-being so they can continue providing high-quality care to their loved ones. There are various types of respite services available, including home-based, community center-based, and hospital-based options. Respite care can be provided by family members, friends, or trained professionals, offering flexibility",

This means that if you have a pre-nuptial agreement in place and you end up in court following the breakdown of your marriage, the judge is not bound by the terms of the pre-nuptial agreement. The only provision in Irish law is under sections 113 and 113A of the Succession Act 1965 (as amended) where a spouse or a civil partner can renounce his/her legal right share in a pre-nuptial agreement. Although they are not legally binding, there is nothing in Irish law which stops a couple planning to marry from having and signing a pre-nuptial agreement. Importantly, such agreements can serve as guides for the courts in judicial separation and divorce cases. If a pre-nuptial agreement makes \u2018proper provision\u2019 for each person it is more likely to be persuasive on the judge.
