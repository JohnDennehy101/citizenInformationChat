In some countries, children below a certain age or adults above a specific age may not be eligible. </branch>```\n\n## Step 3: Investigate Residency Requirements\nNext, we investigate if residency is a requirement. Some healthcare systems reserve GP visit cards for residents within their jurisdiction.\n\n```<step> Residency requirements may vary depending on the country or region. </step> <count>9</count>```\n\n## Step 4: Consider Health Insurance\nHealth insurance status might also impact eligibility.

However, age, residency, and medical conditions also play significant roles. A balanced approach that takes these factors into account is likely the most effective. </comparison>```\n\n## Step 7: Determine the Eligible Group\nBased on our synthesis, we can determine the group that is most likely to be eligible for a GP visit card.\n\n```<answer> Individuals with health insurance, meeting specific age and residency requirements, and those with qualifying medical conditions may be eligible for a GP visit card. </answer>```\n\n## Step 8: Reflect on the Process\nReflecting on our process, we can assess its effectiveness and identify areas for improvement.\n\n```<reflection> The process was effective in exploring multiple angles and synthesizing our findings.

Based on the research, it appears that the scheme targeted young people who are unemployed and not in full-time education.\n\n#### Step 5: Assign a reward score\nReward score: 0.9\nThis branch seems to be a clear and logical path to understanding YESS eligibility.

This means that if you have a pre-nuptial agreement in place and you end up in court following the breakdown of your marriage, the judge is not bound by the terms of the pre-nuptial agreement. The only provision in Irish law is under sections 113 and 113A of the Succession Act 1965 (as amended) where a spouse or a civil partner can renounce his/her legal right share in a pre-nuptial agreement. Although they are not legally binding, there is nothing in Irish law which stops a couple planning to marry from having and signing a pre-nuptial agreement. Importantly, such agreements can serve as guides for the courts in judicial separation and divorce cases. If a pre-nuptial agreement makes \u2018proper provision\u2019 for each person it is more likely to be persuasive on the judge.
