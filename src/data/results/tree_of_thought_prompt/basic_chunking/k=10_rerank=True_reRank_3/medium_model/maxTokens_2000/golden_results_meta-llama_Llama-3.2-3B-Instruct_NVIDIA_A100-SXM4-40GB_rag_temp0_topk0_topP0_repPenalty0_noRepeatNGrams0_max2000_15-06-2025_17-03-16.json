There is a specific definition of residence for tax purposes depending on how many days you spend in the country. If you are not resident in a particular year, Ireland can still be your \u2018ordinary residence\u2019 since this term refers to the country where you are usually resident over a number of years. The country that is your permanent home is known as your domicile .\n\nResidence for tax purposes\n\nYour residence for tax purposes depends on the number of days that you are present in Ireland during a tax year. A tax year runs from 1 January to 31 December.\n\nYou are resident for tax purposes for a year if:\n\nYou spend 183 days or more in Ireland in that year or,\n\nIf you spend 280 days or more in Ireland over a period of 2 consecutive tax years, you will be regarded as resident for the second tax year. For example, if you spend 140 days here in Year 1 and 150 days here in Year 2, you will be resident in Ireland for Year 2. You must be in Ireland for a minimum of 31 days each year.\n\nYou are treated as being present in Ireland for a day if you are present at any time during that day.\n\nChoosing to be resident for tax purposes\n\nIf you arrive in Ireland in a particular year but do not have the required number of days for tax purposes, you can still choose to be resident for that year if you will be resident in the following year.\n\nYou must inform Revenue in writing if you choose to be tax resident in Ireland in a tax year. Contact Revenue for details.\n\nOrdinary residence\n\nYour pattern of residence over a number of years is taken into account to decide your \u2018ordinary residence\u2019.\n\nQuestion: What is ordinary residence?\n\nBegin by enclosing all thoughts within <thinking> tags.

However, this is different from your residence or nationality.\n\n<reflection> At this point, we have a basic understanding of ordinary residence, but let's dive deeper to see if we can find more information. \n\n<reward> 0.8\n\nLet's explore the relationship between ordinary residence and tax residence. \n\nBranch 1: Tax Residence\n\n<step 1>\nIn the context of tax, residence refers to the number of days spent in a country during a tax year.\nA tax year runs from 1 January to 31 December.\n\n<step 2>\nAccording to Revenue, you are resident for tax purposes for a year if you spend 183 days or more in Ireland during that year.\n\n<step 3>\nHowever, there's a catch: you can be resident for tax purposes but not have ordinary residence if you don't intend to live in Ireland permanently.\n\n<step 4>\nFor example, if you spend 140 days in Ireland in Year 1 and 150 days in Year 2, you will be resident in Ireland for Year 2, but you might not intend to live there permanently.\n\n<step 5>\nConsidering this, we can conclude that ordinary residence is a separate concept from tax residence.\n\n<reflection> We've explored the connection between tax residence and ordinary residence. Now, let's see if we can find more information on ordinary residence.\n\n<reward> 0.8\n\nBranch 2: Domicile\n\n<step 1>\nAs mentioned earlier, ordinary residence is different from your nationality or residence.\n\n<step 2>\nDomicile refers to the country where you live with the intention of remaining there permanently.\n\n<step 3>\nHowever, domicile is not the same as ordinary residence.\n\n<step 4>\nDomicile is a broader concept that encompasses your permanent home, whereas ordinary residence is more specific to your pattern of residence over a number of years.\n\n<step 5>\nConsidering this, we can conclude that ordinary residence is a specific concept within the broader category of domicile.\n\n<reflection> We've explored the relationship between ordinary residence and domicile. Now, let's compare and synthesize our findings.\n\nComparison:\nBoth branches have provided valuable insights, but they differ in their approach. Branch 1 focused on the connection between tax residence and ordinary residence, while Branch 2 explored the relationship between ordinary residence and domicile.\n\n<answer>\nOrdinary residence refers to the country where you live with the intention of remaining there permanently, but it is distinct from your residence or nationality. It is a specific concept within the broader category of domicile.\n\n<reflection>\nThe process of exploring different branches and synthesizing our findings has been effective. We've gained a deeper understanding of ordinary residence and its relationship to tax residence and domicile.\n\n<reward> 0.9\n\nOverall, the process has been successful, and we can conclude that ordinary residence is a distinct concept that refers to the country where you live with the intention of remaining there permanently.",

Lack of work: for example, your employer no longer needs or has a reduced need for employees with your skills or new technology has made your job unnecessary.

It happens when your job in the company no longer exists, you are let go and are not replaced.\n\nRedundancy is a last option\n\nYour employer must consult with you before deciding to make you redundant. Redundancy is a last option and there must be valid economic, technical, or organisational grounds justifying changes in the workforce.\n\nBefore your employer makes you redundant, they might offer you another job in the business. This is known as \u2018 alternative work \u2019.\n\nWhat counts as genuine redundancy?\n\nYour employer must be able to justify that there is a genuine reason for making you redundant.\n\nA genuine redundancy is one where your employer has a real business reason to make you redundant.\n\nReasons for redundancy include:\n\nFinancial difficulties within the business: for example, your employer needs to cut costs and this means staff numbers must be reduced.\n\nLack of work : for example, your employer no longer needs or has a reduced need for employees with your skills or new technology has made your job unnecessary.\n\nReorganisation within the business: for example, your employer has decided to carry on the business with fewer or no staff or the job you do no longer exists.\n\nBusiness closure : the business is closing down or moving.\n\nThe difference between redundancy and dismissal\n\nRedundancy\n\nRedundancy is dismissal from your job, caused by your employer needing to reduce the workforce resulting in your job no longer existing.\n\nThe burden of proof is on your employer to show that a legitimate redundancy situation exists and that therefore the dismissal is fair.\n\nFor the dismissal to be fair, your employer must also show that you were fairly selected for redundancy and that fair procedures were followed.\n\nIf you do not agree that the dismissal is fair, you need to show one or more of the following:Document 1:::\nEnglish | Gaeilge\n\nYou are here: Home > Employment > Unemployment and redundancy > Dismissal > Unfair dismissal\n\nUnfair dismissal\n\nWhat is unfair dismissal?\n\nCan I bring a claim for unfair dismissal?\n\nWho cannot bring a claim for unfair dismissal?\n\nHow to bring a claim for unfair dismissal\n\nIf your claim is successful\n\nDismissal from fixed-term or specified-purpose contracts\n\nMore information\n\nWhat is unfair dismissal?\n\nIf you are dismissed from work, the dismissal is automatically considered to be \u2018unfair\u2019 if you are dismissed for:\n\nMembership (or proposed membership) of a trade union, or for engaging in trade union activities\n\nReligious or political opinions\n\nLegal proceedings against an employer where you are a party or a witness\n\nRace, colour, sexual orientation, age, or membership of the Traveller community\n\nPregnancy, giving birth, breastfeeding, or any other matters connected with pregnancy or birth (such as attending antenatal classes)\n\nAvailing of rights under legislation to maternity leave, adoptive leave, paternity leave, carer\u2019s leave, parent\u2019s leave, parental leave or force majeure leave\n\nUnfair selection for redundancy\n\nMaking a protected disclosure (that is, where you raise concerns about possible wrongdoing at work) under the Protected Disclosures Act 2014\n\nUnfair dismissal happens where:\n\nYour employer ends your contract of employment, with or without notice\n\nYou end your contract of employment, with or without notice, due to the conduct of your employer. This is known as constructive dismissal.\n\nWhat does not count as \u2018unfair\u2019 dismissal?\n\nYour dismissal from work is not \u2018unfair\u2019 if it results from:\n\nYour capability, competence or qualifications for the job\n\nYour conduct (behaviour)\n\nYou being unable to work (or continue to work) in the position you held without breaking the law (for example, if your job involves driving and you are then legally disqualified from driving)\n\nYour redundancy (read more about redundancy below)\n\nIn general, redundancy is a fair reason for dismissal. However, you may have grounds (reasons) for complaint if you were unfairly selected for redundancy , or if you feel there was no genuine need for redundancy.\n\nUnless your employer can prove there was a genuine redundancy situation and that they followed fair procedures , your dismissal may be considered \u2018unfair\u2019.\n\nIf you make a claim for unfair dismissal, you cannot also claim redundancy.\n\nCan I bring a claim for unfair dismissal?Document 2:::\nYou are made redundant on carer\u2019s leave\n\nIf you are dismissed on grounds of redundancy, while on carer\u2019s leave , under the Carer\u2019s Leave Act 2001 it would be considered unfair dismissal.\n\nIf your employer does not allow you to return to work at the end of your carer\u2019s leave you may be able to bring a claim under the unfair dismissals legislation. However you may be made redundant after you have returned to work.\n\nI think I was unfairly selected or there wasn\u2019t a genuine redundancy\n\nsituation\n\nIf you feel that your employer has selected you unfairly, or that there was no genuine redundancy situation, you can bring a claim for unfair dismissal.\n\nYou think you were unfairly selected\n\nYour employer should use fair and reasonable selection criteria in choosing people to make redundant.\n\nExamples where your selection could be unfair include:\n\nWhere the custom and practice in your workplace has been last in, first out and your selection did not follow this procedure\n\nWhere your employment contract sets out criteria for selection which were not followed\n\nYour redundancy is unfair if your employer has discriminated in selecting you for redundancy. For example if they make you redundant because you\u2019re pregnant or on maternity leave.\n\nYour employer could also have chosen you for an unfair reason. Unfair reasons include making you redundant because you\u2019ve asked for one of your legal rights, made a health and safety complaint or been on an official strike.\n\nYou think there was no genuine redundancy situation\n\nA genuine redundancy is one where your employer has a real business reason to make you redundant.\n\nSigns your redundancy might not be a genuine include:\n\nYour employer has recently hired new employees to do similar work\n\nYou have a bad relationship with your employer or other people at work\n\nYou are singled out or treated differently from other people at work\n\nThe laws on redundancy\n\nThe laws on redundancy are set out in the Redundancy Payments Acts 1967\u20132014 .\n\nThe requirements to consult on collective redundancies are set out in the Protection of Employment Acts 1977-2024 as amended, and the Employees (Provision of Information and Consultation) Act 2006.\n\nMore information\n\nYou can get more information about your employment rights from the WRC.

If permission is granted, the registrar will send you a form which you must complete and return.\n\nYou will still have to meet the registrar in person at least 5 days before you get married to sign the declaration form. The registrar will then give you a Marriage Registration Form.\n\nInterview with the registrar\n\nIf either you or your partner are not an EU citizen, you will both need to attend an interview with the registrar. The registrar has the right to investigate and decide whether an intended marriage would be a \u2018marriage of convenience\u2019 for immigration purposes.\n\nHow to apply for a marriage visa\n\nYou must apply for a marriage (C) short-stay visa online .\n\nAfter you complete the visa form online, you have 30 days to send the supporting documents. It\u2019s a good idea to prepare your documents before completing the form.\n\nYou pay a fee of \u20ac60 for each application.\n\nSummary sheet\n\nWhen you have submitted the form online, you will get a summary of your application.

If your documents are not in English, you must send a certified translation and the original document.\n\nBirth, marriage, and death certificates will be returned to you. If you want other pages returned to you, you should include a note with your application that says this. Send a photocopy (in addition to the original) of the page you want returned to you.Document 2:::\nYou do not have to use a solicitor to complete your application. If you decide to use a solicitor, you may save money by getting quotes from a number of different law firms.\n\nDocumentation\n\nThe supporting documents you need depend on your situation. If your documents are in a language other than English, you must get them translated by a professional translating service. The Irish Translators\u2019 and Interpreters\u2019 Association has a list of professional translators.\n\nIn all cases, you will need to provide evidence of your identity and nationality.\n\nFrom 20 April 2023, new applicants are only required to provide a certified colour photocopy of the biometric page of their current passport. Your photocopy must be certified by a solicitor, commissioner for oaths, peace commissioner or a notary public.

This means that you can use a wider variety of documents, and be sure that you have enough evidence to send with your application.\n\nYou must have 150 points in both identification and residency. The Citizenship Guidance Document explains how many points you get for different types of documents.\n\nIf your application for naturalisation is based on your marriage or civil partnership with an Irish citizen , you will have to send documents that show your spouse\u2019s nationality and also evidence that you have been married for 3 years.\n\nSome of the documents you need to send must be certified as \u2018true copies\u2019 by a solicitor, notary, commissioner for oaths or a peace commissioner. You can ask a solicitor to certify your documents when you are making your statutory declaration (see Step 4 below). These include:\n\nYour birth certificate\n\nYour spouse\u2019s birth certificate (if your application is based on marriage to an Irish citizen)\n\nYour marriage certificate or civil partnership certificate (if your application is based on marriage to an Irish citizen)\n\nYour passport\n\nYou can find a full list of the documents you need to send when you apply.\n\nProblems with documents\n\nIf you are unable to include documents that are listed and you have tried to get copies of the documents but are unable to, you should explain the reason why you cannot include the documents.\n\nQuestion: How long will my passport application take?\n\nBegin by enclosing all thoughts within <thinking> tags.

            "raw_answer": "Use the following pieces of context to reason step by step before answering the question.\n\n\nExtracted documents:\nDocument 0:::\nYou cannot use this method if you changed employment during the leave year.\n\nMethod 2\n\nCalculate 1/3 of a working week for each calendar month in which you worked at least 117 hours.\n\nMethod 3\n\nCalculate 8% of the hours you worked in the leave year, subject to a maximum of 4 working weeks.\n\nWhen calculating your holiday entitlement, your employer should include all the hours you worked, including time spent on annual leave, maternity leave, parental leave, force majeure leave, adoptive leave or the first 13 weeks of carer\u2019s leave.\n\nIf you have worked for at least 8 months, you are entitled to an unbroken period of 2 weeks' annual leave. This means you can get 2 weeks off in a row.\n\nHoliday pay\n\nHoliday pay (pay for annual leave) must be paid in advance at your normal weekly rate .\n\nIf your pay changes from week-to-week (for example, because of commission or bonus payments), your holiday pay is the average of your pay over the 13 weeks before you take holidays.\n\nPart-time employees\n\nGenerally, annual leave for part-time workers is calculated using Method 3 above. This means you can get 8% of your hours worked.\n\nIf you work full time for some months and part-time for the rest of the year, you should calculate the leave for the full-time and the part-time periods of work separately.\n\nAgency employees\n\nIf you are an agency worker, the party who pays your wages (employment agency or client company) is the employer for the purposes of the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997 , and is responsible for providing your annual leave entitlement.\n\nCan my employer force me to take annual leave?\n\nUsually, employees can ask to take annual leave at specific times. Your employer can accept your request, or refuse your request.\n\nYour employer decides when annual leave may be taken, but this is subject to a number of conditions. Your employer must:\n\nTake into account your family responsibilities, as well as the available opportunities for rest and recreation.\n\nDiscuss your annual leave with you (or your union) at least one month before you are to take the leave.\n\nCan I \u2018carry over\u2019 annual leave to next year?\n\nAnnual leave should be taken within the leave year (see above). Depending on your employer, you can agree to take your annual leave within 6 months of the relevant leave year.Document 1:::\nYou must be paid at your normal daily rate of pay . Your employer should not make any reference to domestic violence leave on your payslip.\n\nWhat is normal daily pay?\n\nYour normal daily pay includes any regular bonus or allowance which does not change from week to week (but excludes overtime or commission).\n\nIf your pay changes from week to week , your pay for domestic violence leave is the average of your pay over the 13 weeks before you are on leave. This could be, for example, because of regular bonus payments or allowances.\n\nHow to apply\n\nCheck if your employer has a workplace domestic violence policy and follow the process to apply for the leave and other supports available.\n\nDo I need to give notice to my employer?\n\nYou do not have to give your employer notice to take domestic violence leave in emergency circumstances.\n\nYou should give notice if you are able to, or as soon as you practically can after taking it.\n\nDisclosing your experience to your employer\n\nGetting support from your employer means you need to disclose your experience to someone at work. In most jobs, employees usually tell their direct manager about absences.\n\nOr, your employer may assign a specific or designated person to handle matters related to domestic violence leave and other available support. The designated person could be a HR manager or the business owner.\n\nYour employer should make sure the designated person is well-trained to handle employee disclosures properly.\n\nCan my employer ask for proof?\n\nYou are not required to give your employer any supporting information or evidence when requesting domestic violence leave.\n\nThere might be exceptional situations where your employer could ask for supporting documents, but this would be rare and is not in line with the intentions of the law.\n\nConfidentiality\n\nYour employer should treat any information you disclose about domestic violence with the utmost sensitivity and confidentiality.\n\nThey should only share the information with those who need it for safety plans or administering domestic violence leave. Ideally, your employer should get your written permission before sharing any information.\n\nSharing information does not always mean breaking confidentiality. Your employer can find ways to share details without revealing your identity or the fact that you disclosed domestic violence.\n\nYour employment rights\n\nIn general, you will be treated as if you are in work during domestic violence leave.\n\nThis means:\n\nYour time on domestic violence leave does not break your continuous service. It also counts as service when calculating entitlements such as annual leave and public holidays.\n\nYou must not be dismissed for taking or asking to take domestic violence leave.Document 2:::\nEnglish | Gaeilge\n\nYou are here: Home > Employment > Employment rights and conditions > Leave and holidays > Other types of leave from work\n\nOther types of leave from work\n\nTaking time off work\n\nForce majeure leave\n\nLeave for medical care\n\nCompassionate leave\n\nJury service\n\nCareer break or study leave\n\nHow to make a complaint\n\nMore information\n\nTaking time off work\n\nThere are different reasons you might need time off work, for example:\n\nIf you have a family crisis, like a sudden illness in your family\n\nIf you are called for jury service\n\nIf you want to take study leave or a career break\n\nIn some cases, you are entitled to be paid for your leave, but in others you are not.\n\nYou may also want to read about types of statutory leave from work, including:\n\nAnnual leave\n\nPublic holidays\n\nSick leave\n\nMaternity leave\n\nPaternity leave\n\nAdoptive leave\n\nCarer\u2019s leave\n\nParental leave\n\nParent's leave\n\nLeave for medical care\n\nDomestic violence leave\n\nForce majeure leave\n\nIf you have a family crisis, you have a right to limited time off work. This is called force majeure leave .\n\nYou may need to take force majeure leave for an urgent family reason, such as the unexpected injury or illness of a \u2018close family member\u2019.\n\nA close family member includes:\n\nYour child (including an adopted child)\n\nYour spouse or partner\n\nYour parent or grandparent\n\nYour sibling\n\nSomeone who you have a duty of care for (for example, you are acting in place of a parent, also known as loco parentis )\n\nSomeone who depends on you for care (known as \u2018domestic dependency\u2019)\n\nOther people as defined by law\n\nIf a close family member has died, you do not have an entitlement to force majeure leave. Instead, you may be able to take \u2018compassionate leave\u2019 \u2013 read more about compassionate leave below.\n\nTaking force majeure leave\n\nYou can take force majeure leave of one or more days up to a maximum of:\n\n3 days in 12 consecutive months, or\n\nA total of 5 days in 36 consecutive months (3 years)\n\nDepending on your employer and your contract of employment, you may be able to take more than this.\n\nQuestion: Can my employer force me to take annual leave?\n\nBegin by enclosing all thoughts within <thinking> tags.

Your employer cannot insist you take annual leave on days you are off sick and have a medical certificate.\n\nYou can continue to build up your annual leave entitlement while you are off sick, once you have a medical certificate.\n\nIf you are on long-term sick leave and cannot take your annual leave due to illness, you can carry it over for up to 15 months after the end of the year you built it up. If you leave your job within these 15 months, you should get holiday pay instead of the annual leave days you could not take due to illness.\n\nIf I take sick leave while on probation\n\nYour employer can suspend your probation, training or apprenticeship for the period you are on sick leave. The days can be added onto the end of your probation, training or apprenticeship period.\n\nHaving problems getting sick pay\n\nIf you do not get the sick pay you are due, contact your employer to try to resolve the issue informally first.\n\nIf you cannot resolve the issue directly with your employer, you can make a formal complaint to the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC) .\n\nHow to make a complaint to the WRC\n\nIf you have a dispute about sick pay, you can make a formal complaint to the WRC.

This means you are both entitled to 26 weeks leave.\n\nIf you both work for the same employer and your employer agrees, you can transfer 14 weeks of your parental leave entitlement to the other parent.\n\nWhat happens if I change jobs before taking all my leave?\n\nIf you change job and have used part of your parental leave allowance, you can use the remainder of your allowance after one year's employment with your new employer (once your child is still under 12).\n\nProtection of your employment rights\n\nYour employment rights are protected during parental leave.

During the illness, you are treated as an employee who is sick .\n\nWhat happens to my social insurance contributions?\n\nYou can get credited PRSI contributions while you are taking parental leave. Credited PRSI contributions can protect your social insurance record and your entitlement to benefits in the future.\n\nYour employer must write to the Client Eligibility Services section of Department of Social Protection (DSP), setting out the weeks you have not worked, so that you can get credited PRSI contributions for this time.\n\nCan my employer refuse my request for parental leave?\n\nYour employer can only refuse parental leave if you are not entitled to take it.\n\nCan my employer postpone my parental leave?\n\nYour employer can postpone your parental leave for up to 6 months.

You can read more about health and safety at work .\n\nReporting and accident at work\n\nYou should report any workplace accident to your employer. Your employer must report certain accidents to the Health and Safety Authority (HSA) . If you miss more than 3 consecutive days at work because of an accident or injury, your employer must report this to the HSA. The 3 days does not include the day of the accident.\n\nSick leave and sick pay\n\nSince 1 January 2024, you have a right to 5 days\u2019 sick pay a year (increased from 3 days in 2023). This is called statutory sick pay (that means the legal minimum). Sick pay is paid by your employer at 70% of your normal pay up to a maximum of \u20ac110 a day.\n\nSocial welfare payments\n\nThere are a number of benefits you may be entitled to while you are out sick.\n\nOccupational Injuries Scheme\n\nThe Occupational Injuries Scheme is a group of benefits if you are injured or incapacitated by an accident at work or while travelling directly to or from work.\n\nInjury Benefit is paid if you are unfit for work due to an accident at work or while you are travelling to or from work.\n\nUnder the Medical Care Scheme you can claim certain medical costs that are not paid by the Health Service Executive (HSE) or covered by the Treatment Benefit Scheme.\n\nQuestion: What if I get sick while on annual leave?\n\nBegin by enclosing all thoughts within <thinking> tags. Instead of a single linear chain, explicitly generate and explore multiple branches of reasoning as separate <branch id=\"X\"> elements, each representing a distinct approach or angle.\n\nWithin each <branch>:\n- Break down the reasoning into clear <step> tags.\n- After each step, include a <count> tag showing the remaining step budget (start with 10 steps per branch; request more if needed).\n- Use <reflection> tags periodically within branches to critically evaluate progress.\n- Assign a <reward> score (0.0 to 1.0) after reflections to assess quality of that branch's approach:\n   - 0.8+ Continue this branch\n   - 0.5-0.7 Consider minor adjustments\n   - Below 0.5 Backtrack or abandon this branch\n - If reward is low or you're unsure, backtrack and try a different <branch>, explaining the reasoning inside new <thinking> tags.\n - Use thoughts as a scratchpad: show calculations, considerations, pros/cons explicitly.\n\nOnce multiple branches have been explored and evaluated, compare and synthesize insights in a <comparison> tag, weighing strengths and weaknesses.\nFinally, provide a consolidated final answer inside <answer> tags - a clear, consise summary based on the best branch or synthesis.\nConclude with an overall <reflection> and a final <reward> score reflecting the whole process's effectiveness.\n---\n\n<thinking>\nGiven the context of the provided documents, I'd like to explore what happens to my annual leave when I am off sick. Specifically, I am curious about the following:\n- Can I take annual leave during sick leave?\n- How does the situation change if I am on long-term sick leave?\n- Are there any exceptions or specific circumstances that affect my entitlement to annual leave during sick leave?\n\n<step 1: Reviewing the documents>\nI've reviewed the documents provided, focusing on sections related to sick leave and annual leave. According to Document 0, I am entitled to time off work for the public holiday if I am on sick leave during a public holiday, as long as I have worked at least 40 hours over the previous 5 weeks.\n\n<step 2: Examining the exceptions>\nHowever, Document 0 also states that there are exceptions to this rule. If I am on sick leave immediately before the public holiday and meet certain conditions (e.g., being off work for more than 26 weeks due to an ordinary illness or an accident), I am not entitled to pay or time off for the public holiday.\n\n<step 3: Investigating long-term sick leave>\nDocument 1 provides more information on what happens to my annual leave when I am on long-term sick leave. According to this document, if I am on long-term sick leave and cannot take my annual leave due to illness, I can carry it over for up to 15 months after the end of the year I built it up.\n\n<step 4: Reviewing the rules for parental leave>\nDocument 1 also mentions that if I am on parental leave and become sick, my leave can be suspended for the duration of the illness. However, this does not directly address what happens to my annual leave.\n\n<reflection>\nUpon reviewing the documents, I notice that there is some overlap between the rules for sick leave and annual leave. However, the specific circumstances and exceptions outlined in Document 0 and Document 1 provide a clear framework for understanding what happens to my annual leave during sick leave.\n\n<reward> 0.8\n\n<step 5: Synthesizing the information>\nBased on the information provided, it appears that I can take annual leave during sick leave, but there are exceptions and specific circumstances that affect my entitlement. If I am on long-term sick leave, I can carry over my annual leave for up to 15 months after the end of the year I built it up. However, if I am on parental leave and become sick, my leave can be suspended for the duration of the illness.\n\n<step 6: Considering the rules for public holidays>\nDocument 0 also states that if I am on sick leave during a public holiday, I am entitled to time off work for the public holiday, as long as I have worked at least 40 hours over the previous 5 weeks. This suggests that my entitlement to annual leave during sick leave may not be affected by the presence of a public holiday.\n\n<step 7: Reviewing the Occupational Injuries Scheme>\nDocument 2 provides information on the Occupational Injuries Scheme, which includes benefits for individuals who are injured or incapacitated by an accident at work or while traveling directly to or from work. However, this document does not directly address what happens to annual leave during sick leave.\n\n<step 8: Examining the Medical Care Scheme>\nDocument 2 also mentions the Medical Care Scheme, which allows individuals to claim certain medical costs that are not paid by the Health Service Executive (HSE) or covered by the Treatment Benefit Scheme. However, this document does not provide information on annual leave.\n\n<step 9: Reviewing the Social Welfare Payments>\nDocument 2 provides information on social welfare payments, including the Occupational Injuries Scheme and the Medical Care Scheme. However, this document does not address what happens to annual leave during sick leave.\n\n<step 10: Considering the PRSI contributions>\nDocument 2 mentions that I can get credited PRSI contributions while I am taking parental leave. However, this does not provide information on annual leave.\n\n<reflection>\nUpon reviewing the documents, I notice that there is a lack of clear information on what happens to annual leave during sick leave. However, the documents do provide a framework for understanding the rules and exceptions.\n\n<reward> 0.7\n\n<branch id=\"X\">\n<thinking>\nGiven the context of the provided documents, I'd like to explore what happens to my annual leave when I am off sick, with a focus on the following:\n- Can I take annual leave during sick leave?\n- Are there any exceptions or specific circumstances that affect my entitlement to annual leave during sick leave?\n\n<step 1: Reviewing the documents>\nI've reviewed the documents provided, focusing on sections related to sick leave and annual leave.

However, this may not apply if the landlord plans to sell 10 or more dwellings in a development within a 6-month period \u2013 see \u2018Restriction on terminating when selling multiple properties\u2019 below The landlord needs the property for their own use or for an immediate family member (this only applies to private landlords) The landlord plans to change the use of the property (for example, convert it from residential use to office use) The landlord intends to refurbish the property substantially",
            "question": "What is a valid reason for ending a tenancy after the first 6 months?",
            "raw_answer": "Use the following pieces of context to reason step by step before answering the question.\n\n\nExtracted documents:\nDocument 0:::\nRead more about leases on the website of Threshold, the national housing charity.\n\nPeriodic tenancy\n\nA periodic tenancy agreement does not specify a fixed length of time. The period of the tenancy may be weekly or monthly, depending on how often the rent is due. Periodic tenancy agreements may or may not be in writing.\n\nYour landlord can end the tenancy at any time during the first 6 months of the tenancy without having to give a reason, but, in general, you will get security of tenure after 6 months \u2013 see \u2018Part 4 tenancy\u2019 below. You must always get a valid written notice of termination and there are rules about how much notice you must be given, depending on the length of the tenancy (with some exceptions). Read more in our page If your landlord wants you to leave .\n\nAs a tenant, you can end the periodic tenancy at any time. You do not have to give a reason. Again, there are rules about notice periods and what constitutes a valid notice of termination \u2013 see \u2018Ending your tenancy\u2019 below.\n\nClaiming a Part 4 tenancy at the end of a fixed-term lease\n\nIf you have a fixed-term contract or lease and you want to remain in the property under a Part 4 tenancy, you should notify your landlord of your intention to stay in the property. You should do this between 3 months and 1 month before your fixed\u2013term tenancy or lease agreement expires.\n\nIf you do not notify your landlord, you cannot be refused coverage under Part 4, but you may have to compensate the landlord for any financial loss that they have because you did not notify them of your intention to remain in the tenancy.\n\nEnding your tenancy\n\nThe following section outlines what a tenant must do to end a tenancy. There are different rules for landlords who want to end a tenancy . The RTB also has information on their website about how a tenant can end a tenancy .\n\nFormat of termination notice\n\nAs a tenant, you can terminate your tenancy (whether fixed-term or periodic) without giving a reason, but you must give a valid notice of termination to your landlord. In order to be valid, this notice must:\n\nBe in writing\n\nBe signed by you\n\nSpecify the date that you are serving it on the landlord\n\nSpecify the termination date of the tenancy (you have the full 24 hours of this date to vacate possession)Document 1:::\nYou do not have security of tenure . This came in under the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2019 (pdf) .\n\nYou cannot be forced to pay for student-specific accommodation during the summer when you don\u2019t need it. Your tenancy or licence arrangement should not be more than 41 weeks, unless you ask for longer. If your landlord does not comply with the 41-week rule you should contact to the RTB, who can sanction your landlord. This rule came in under the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2024 and applies to tenancies and licence arrangements in student-specific accommodation created from 20 July 2024.\n\nYou only need to give your landlord 28 days\u2019 notice when ending a tenancy. You can give your landlord more notice if you want and your landlord must give you more. This came in under the Residential Tenancies (No. 2) Act 2021 .\n\nYou can terminate your fixed-term tenancy any time between 1 May and 1 October each year for any reason. But, outside of these dates, the existing rules about ending a fixed-term tenancy apply and you can only terminate your tenancy for specific reasons. This rule came in under the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2024 .\n\nFind out more about your rights as a tenant in student-specific accommodation on the RTB\u2019s website .\n\nSecurity of tenure\n\nSecurity of tenure is a tenant\u2019s right to stay in rented accommodation for a set amount of time. Generally, security of tenure applies automatically when you have been renting for 6 months and haven\u2019t received a valid notice of termination from your landlord in that time. When you have security of tenure, your landlord can only terminate your tenancy for a limited number of reasons, see our page \u2018 If your landlord wants you to leave \u2019.\n\nThe amount of time you are entitled to stay in rented accommodation after the first 6 months depends on when your tenancy began.\n\nIf your tenancy was created after 10 June 2022 , you have a tenancy of unlimited duration. This means if you have rented somewhere for 6 months, you have the right to stay in that accommodation indefinitely (no end date), unless the landlord wants to terminate your tenancy for one of the allowed reasons.Document 2:::\nIf this is not done, the notice of termination is invalid. The RTB recommends that landlords use certified post when posting the notice of termination to the tenant and the RTB, and that they keep proof of this.\n\nWhen the RTB receives the notice of termination it will:\n\nWrite to you and your landlord about the RTB services and outline your rights and responsibilities under residential tenancies legislation\n\nAsk for your contact details in case the landlord needs them to offer the property back to you. This will only be done with your consent\n\nThis requirement is in place since 6 July 2022, when it was brought in under the Regulation of Providers of Building Works and Miscellaneous Provisions Act 2022.\n\nThe RTB's website has more information about these changes .\n\nWhat is a valid notice of termination?\n\nThe law sets out the requirements for a valid notice of termination. It must:\n\nBe in writing (an email is not sufficient)\n\nBe signed by the landlord (or an authorised agent)\n\nSpecify the date of termination of the tenancy\n\nState that you have the whole 24 hours of the termination date to vacate the property\n\nSpecify the date of the notice itself\n\nState the reason for termination, if a tenancy has lasted more than 6 months or is a fixed-term tenancy. (This does not have to be included for tenancies in student-specific accommodation.)\n\nState that any issue about the validity of the notice or the right of the landlord to serve it must be referred to the RTB within 90 days from the receipt of the notice. (This 90-day timeframe applies unless the tenant is in breach of their obligations.)\n\nYour landlord must give additional details in certain situations and, in some cases, a statutory declaration. The information below describes the additional details needed for each of the valid reasons for terminating your tenancy. The RTB also provides sample notices of termination , with the details required in each situation.\n\nIf the property is being sold\n\nIf your landlord intends to sell the property within 9 months of the terminating your tenancy, the notice of termination must state that:\n\n\u201cThe reason for the termination of the tenancy is due to the fact that the landlord intends to sell the dwelling, for full consideration, within 9 months after the termination of the tenancy\u201d.\n\nQuestion: What is a valid reason for ending a tenancy after the first 6 months?\n\nBegin by enclosing all thoughts within <thinking> tags.

These rights apply if you bought online from a trader based in Ireland or the EU.\n\nYou have different rights if you:\n\nBought online, by catalogue or over the phone on or after 29 November 2022. This is because the Consumer Rights Act 2022 (pdf) introduced new rights .\n\nBought from a trader in the UK\n\nYour rights\n\nIf you bought online, you have the same rights under consumer law as buying in a shop.\n\nQuality, performance and durability\n\nUnder the Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Act, 1980 the goods you bought must meet standards of quality, performance and durability.\n\nGoods must be:\n\nOf satisfactory (merchantable) quality taking into account durability and price\n\nFit for the purpose you bought it\n\nAs described, matching any description advertised or other information the seller gave you\n\nExtra rights\n\nWhen you bought goods online, you entered into a contract called a distance contract. A distance contract covers sales that were done online, over the phone, by mail order, or from a door-to-door salesperson.\n\nWith this type of contract, you did not enter into the contract in person and you could not check the products before you bought them. Because of this, you have extra protections under EU law.\n\nBought online from a UK trader\n\nIf you bought online from a UK trader after 1 January 2021, you may not automatically have the same consumer rights. You can read more about buying online from the UK after Brexit.\n\nIf your delayed or non-delivery\n\nYou have the following rights around delayed deliveries or non-delivery:\n\nYou must get your goods within 30 days of buying them (unless you agreed to a different timeframe for delivery)Document 1:::\nInformation after buying\n\nYou must get a copy of the signed contract or confirmation of your order. The confirmation must be on paper or in another durable format such as email.\n\nIf there is a dispute about what information was provided, the seller must show they gave you the information.\n\nYour right to cancel\n\nYou have a right to cancel within 14 days when a product is not bought in a physical shop. This is also known as a \u2018withdrawal\u2019 or \u2018cooling off\u2019 period.\n\nThis means you can cancel the contract up to 14 days from when the contract was agreed and get a full refund.\n\nYou do not have to give you a reason for cancelling. The 14 days starts once you physically receive the goods.\n\nIf the seller does not give you information on your cancellation rights, your right to cancel is extended by 12 months. If the seller gives you information on your right to cancel within this 12-month period, the cooling-off period ends 14 days from the date you get the information.\n\nYou can read more about cooling off periods for services or digital content or services.\n\nHow to cancel\n\nBefore the cooling-off period ends, you must tell the seller you want to cancel. You must do this in writing by email or post, or by using the cancellation form provided by the seller.\n\nThe European Consumer Centre (ECC) Ireland has a letter template which may be helpful.\n\nRight to a refund within 14 days of cancellation\n\nYou must be refunded within 14 days of cancellation, using the same payment method you used, unless you agree to a different payment method.\n\nExcluded purchases\n\nThe cooling-off period does not apply to certain purchases.\n\nExamples are:\n\nPersonalised or custom-made products\n\nProducts with a short shelf life that spoil quickly\n\nProducts that cannot be returned for health or hygiene reasons\n\nLeisure services that are for a set date or period such as hotel bookings, car rental or concert tickets\n\nPassenger transport services such as bus, rail or air\n\nWho pays for the cost of return?\n\nYou are responsible for returning the product to the seller. The seller does not have to refund you for return postage costs. Some sellers will cover the return costs but it depends on the seller\u2019s return policy. The seller must tell you before you bought the product whether you will have to pay the return postage costs yourself.Document 2:::\n_Page edited: 12 June 2020 _\n\nRelated documents\n\nCompensation for overbooked, cancelled and delayed flights in the EU\n\nAir passengers have specific consumer rights.

There are different types of domestic adoption, for example, step-parent adoption and long-term foster care adoption .\n\nThis page explains the different types of domestic adoption, the steps involved in the adoption process, and the rules about who can adopt a child in Ireland.\n\nYou may also want to read our page about intercountry adoption , which is where you adopt a child from abroad.\n\nTypes of domestic adoption\n\nDomestic adoption is when you adopt a child who is resident in Ireland. There are different types of domestic adoption:\n\nStep-parent adoption\n\nStep-parent adoption is where you apply to adopt your partner\u2019s child.\n\nYour partner can consent (agree) to the adoption and still keep their own parental rights and responsibilities. In a step-parent adoption, you and your partner share parenting duties once the adoption order is made. Read about adoption orders in the section \u2018Steps involved in adopting a child\u2019, below.\n\nThe child must have lived with their parent and you (the prospective step- parent) together, for a minimum of 2 years .\n\nExtended family adoption\n\nAn extended family adoption is where a member of the child\u2019s family (or a relative), adopts the child. The child would have been placed with them by the birth mother or by the Tusla childcare system.\n\nDomestic infant adoption\n\nDomestic infant adoption is where a child is placed with an alternative set of parents. The child is placed with the couple by the Tusla adoption service or an accredited adoption agency. The Adoption Authority of Ireland must approve the placement before it takes place.\n\nLong term foster care adoption\n\nFoster care adoption is when a couple adopt a child who was originally placed with them in a foster care situation.\n\nFind more information on the different types of domestic adoption on the Adoption Authority of Ireland\u2019s website.\n\nWho can adopt a child in Ireland?Document 1:::\nEnglish | Gaeilge\n\nYou are here: Home > Family and Relationships > Adoption, fostering and surrogacy > Intercountry adoption\n\nIntercountry adoption\n\nWhat is intercountry adoption?\n\nWho can adopt?\n\nBeing assessed for eligibility to adopt\n\nChoosing a country to adopt from\n\nThe process of intercountry adoption\n\nGetting immigration clearance for the child\n\nSteps to take once the child arrives in Ireland\n\nMore information about intercountry adoption\n\nWhat is intercountry adoption?\n\nIf you adopt a child who lives in a country outside Ireland, the process is called intercountry adoption. If you adopt a child who is resident in Ireland, it is called domestic adoption .\n\nWhen you adopt a child, they become a member of your family. Adoption creates a legal relationship between the adoptive parents and the child.\n\nAs intercountry adoption is a complex legal process, you should get legal advice from a solicitor who specialises in intercountry adoption. See 'More information about intercountry adoption' below.\n\nWho can adopt?\n\nYou must be at least 21 years of age to adopt a child under Irish law. There is no Irish legal upper age limit for adopting parents but age is a factor in determining suitability here.\n\nYou must also:\n\nHave a valid 'declaration of eligibility and suitability' (see 'Being assessed for eligibility to adopt' below)\n\nBe \u2018habitually resident in the State\u2019, which means Ireland has become your home. Living in Ireland for at least one year before the date of the making of the adoption order would generally be sufficient.\n\nYour relationship status does not necessarily impact your eligibility to adopt a child. This means you are eligible to adopt if you are:\n\nA married couple\n\nA couple living together in a civil partnership\n\nA couple cohabiting together in a relationship for at least 3 years (living together but not married or in a civil partnership)\n\nA sole applicant who is not in one of the categories listed above (only where the Adoption Authority is satisfied that, in the particular circumstances of the case, it is desirable and in the best interests of the child)\n\nYou may also be eligible to adopt if you are the mother, father or relative of the child. \u2018Relative\u2019 means a grandparent, brother, sister, uncle or aunt of the child (or the spouse of any such person), with the relationship to the child being traced through either the mother or the father.Document 2:::\nTo request an Immigration Clearance Letter, you need to write to:\n\nForeign Adoptions Unit\n\nUnit 3 Domestic Residence & Permissions Division\n\n4th floor\n\nImmigration Service Delivery\n\nDepartment of Justice\n\n13-14 Burgh Quay\n\nDublin 2\n\nD02 XK70\n\nYou must include:\n\nA letter of application, with a daytime contact number\n\nA photocopy of the passport of each adopter\n\nTwo passport size photographs of each adopter\n\nThe original Declaration of Eligibility and Suitability (not a copy)\n\nA letter from the Adoption Authority stating how many children you are eligible to adopt and from what country\n\nThese documents will be returned to you with your Immigration Clearance Letter, when approved. You will need to show this letter to an immigration officer when you return to Ireland.\n\nSteps to take once the child arrives in Ireland\n\nTell the Adoption Authority that the child has arrived\n\nYou must tell the Adoption Authority of Ireland and Tusla when you bring the child to Ireland for the first time after adoption in the country of origin. Find contact details in the section \u2018More information about intercountry adoption\u2019 below.\n\nYou must also tell the Adoption Authority and Tusla if you have brought the child to Ireland, in order to adopt the child through domestic adoption .\n\nYou must do this within 3 months of the child arriving in Ireland.\n\nRegister the adoption in Ireland\n\nIf the child was adopted in the country of origin, the final step in the intercountry adoption process is the registration of the adoption. This is the formal, legal recognition of the adoption by the Irish State.\n\nYou must complete and submit an application for registration of the adoption (pdf) to the Adoption Authority within 3 months of re-entering Ireland following the adoption.\n\nThe Adoption Authority can register the adoption in the \u2018Register of Intercountry Adoptions\u2019, on the basis of an \u2018Article 23 certificate\u2019. An Article 23 certificate is a certificate of assurance from the child\u2019s country of origin that proves the adoption was carried out in compliance with the Hague Convention.\n\nGetting an adoption certificate\n\nWhen the adoption has been registered, it will appear on the Register of Intercountry Adoptions.

If you commit a motoring offence , and the penalty for the offence includes penalty points, your driving licence will be endorsed with one or more penalty points.\n\nSome traffic offences have other penalties, such as fines as well as penalty points.\n\nThe penalty points system for driving offences has operated in Ireland since 2002. The law governing penalty points is the Road Traffic Act 2002 . This legislation has been amended a number of times to add offences for which penalty points can be issued.\n\nWhile penalty points are endorsed on your driving licence, the points do not physically appear on the licence. Your penalty points are recorded on your driving licence record, which is held on the National Vehicle and Driver File operated by the Department of Transport.\n\nPenalty point endorsements remain on your licence record for 3 years and must be notified to your insurance company when applying for motor insurance. Motor insurance companies have had access to the National Vehicle and Driver File since 2014.\n\nEndorsements on your licence record will often lead to an increase in your motor insurance premium.\n\nHow do penalty points work?\n\nPenalty points are recorded on your driving licence when:\n\nYou are convicted in court of a driving offence that attracts penalty points or\n\nYou pay a fixed charge notice that was issued to you for an offence that also carries penalty points\n\nIf you get 12 penalty points in any 3 year period, you are automatically disqualified from driving for 6 months.\n\nLearner permit drivers are disqualified if they have 7 penalty points. This lower threshold also applies for the first 2 years of a driver\u2019s first full driving licence.\n\nPenalty points are not added to your licence immediately.\n\nFixed charge and penalty offences\n\nFixed notice penalties are issued for driving offences that attract penalty points and/or just a fine.Document 1:::\nExamples of how penalty points and fines are awarded.\n\nSpeeding offences : A fixed charge fine of \u20ac160, together with 3 penalty points. If you have been caught speeding on a police traffic camera, you will get a notice of your fine and penalty points for the offence by post. You have 28 days in which to pay your fine from the date the notice is issued to you. If you do not pay your fine, the fine then increases to \u20ac240, which you must pay within 28 days. If after this time (56 days) you still have not paid your fine, the offence is referred to the courts. If you are convicted in court of speeding offences and non-payment of fines, you will automatically receive 5 penalty points and a fine up to a maximum of \u20ac1,000.\n\nSeatbelt offences : If you drive without a seatbelt or allow children under 17 years to travel in your car without a seatbelt, you will incur a fixed charge fine of \u20ac120. You must pay this fine within 28 days or face an increased fine of \u20ac180 payable within 56 days of the offence. 3 penalty points will be added to your licence if you pay the fine on time. If you are convicted in court for non-wearing of a seatbelt, 5 penalty points will be added to your licence and you will be liable to a \u20ac2,000 fine for a first offence. Read more about seatbelts and the law in Ireland .\n\nMotor insurance offences : If you drive without insurance, you will get 5 penalty points and will have to appear in court. The court can issue a fine of up to \u20ac5,000 and can send you to prison for up to 6 months. The court can disqualify you from driving instead of issuing penalty points.\n\nCareless driving : If you drive \u2018a vehicle in a public place without due care and attention' you can get up to 5 penalty points on your licence and a fine of up to \u20ac5,000. If careless driving causes death or serious bodily harm, you are liable on conviction on indictment to imprisonment for a term of up to 2 years or to a fine of up to \u20ac10,000 or to both.\n\nOther penalty point questions\n\nWhat happens if someone else was driving my vehicle?Document 2:::\nPenalty points are not added to your licence immediately.\n\nFixed charge and penalty offences\n\nFixed notice penalties are issued for driving offences that attract penalty points and/or just a fine.\n\nIf you receive a fixed notice penalty, you will be issued a notice by the Department of Transport. If you pay the fixed charge fine within 56 days, you will get a further notice from the Department of Transport confirming that the penalty points will be added to your driving licence.

The Department of Transport will then issue a notification that these penalty points will be added to your driving licence 28 days after the notification date.\n\nYou can get information on fixed charge notices and fines in our document on driving offences .\n\nHow long do penalty points stay on my licence?\n\nPenalty points remain on your licence record for 3 years. Any period where your licence is out of date or you are serving a court disqualification does not count as part of the 3 years.\n\nIf you accumulate 12 points or 7 where applicable and are disqualified from driving for 6 months, the points which led to the disqualification are removed at the end of the 6 months.\n\nBut if you had more offences that had not been endorsed on your licence record by the time you started your 6 month suspension, these extra points would be added to your licence record and would remain on your licence for 3 years (from the time your licence was reinstated).\n\nWhat happens to my licence if I have 12 penalty points or 7 where\n\napplicable?\n\nIf you have been notified by the Department of Transport that you have been disqualified from driving because you have reached 12 penalty points or more, you must surrender your driving licence to the National Driver Licence Service for the period of 6 months.\n\nWhat motoring offences result in penalty points?\n\nThe Road Traffic Act 2002, (as amended) legislates for motoring offences that incur penalty points.

Some types of absences do not count towards reckonable service .\n\nIf you work part-time\n\nBy law, part-time workers cannot have less favourable conditions of employment than comparable full-time workers.\n\nThis means that part-time workers (including casual workers) have a right to statutory redundancy. You must still meet the requirement for 2 years' continuous service described above.\n\nIf you are an agency worker\n\nAs an agency worker , you are also protected under redundancy legislation.\n\nIf the employment agency pays your wages, it is responsible for paying the statutory redundancy payment.\n\nIf you are an apprentice\n\nIf you are an apprentice and are made redundant during the apprenticeship, you may qualify for a redundancy payment. You must meet the conditions of having 2 years' service (104 weeks) over the age of 16.\n\nIf you are dismissed within one month of the end of the apprenticeship, you will not qualify for a redundancy payment.\n\nIf you are kept on as an employee for more than a month after the apprenticeship ended and are subsequently made redundant, the time spent as an apprentice aged over 16 will count in the redundancy payment calculation.\n\nIf you are on a fixed-term contract\n\nIf you are on a fixed-term contract you may be entitled to statutory redundancy if your employer does not renew your fixed- term contract under the same or a similar contract before the term expires.Document 1:::\nRead more about the steps you need to take if your employer refuses to pay or where there is a dispute .\n\nMore information\n\nYou can get more information about the Redundancy Payments Scheme on gov.ie, on the Irish National Organisation of the Unemployed (INOU)'s website inou.ie or from the Workplace Relations Commission's Information and Customer Services .\n\nThe application for payment from the Social Insurance Fund should be sent to:\n\nRedundancy Payments Section\n\nDepartment of Social Protection\n\nGround Floor Gandon House Amiens Street Dublin 1 D01 A361\n\nTel: (01) 673 4500 or 0818 111 112\n\nHomepage: https://www.gov.ie/en/service/78213a-redundancy-payments/\n\nFor further information about the Redundancy Payments Scheme contact:\n\nWorkplace Relations Commission - Information and Customer Service\n\nO'Brien Road Carlow R93 E920\n\nOpening Hours: Mon. to Fri. 9.30am to 1pm, 2pm to 5pm\n\nTel: (059) 917 8990\n\nLocall: 0818 80 80 90\n\nHomepage: https://www.workplacerelations.ie/en/\n\n_Page edited: 27 October 2022 _\n\nRelated documents\n\nProblems getting your redundancy pay\n\nYour employer should pay the redundancy lump sum to you when your employment ends.

Given the information provided in the extracted documents, let's explore this question step by step through different branches of reasoning.\n\n### Branch 1: Understanding the Definition of Redundancy Pay\n\n#### Step 1: Identify the key concept of redundancy pay\nRedundancy pay is a minimum payment made by an employer to an employee when they are made redundant due to the closure of the business or reduction of staff numbers.\n\n#### Step 2: Determine the eligibility criteria\nTo be eligible for redundancy pay, an employee must have 2 years' (104 weeks) service in their job.\n\n#### Step 3: Reflect on the calculation method\nRedundancy pay is calculated based on a lump-sum formula using an employee's pay and length of service.\n\n#### Step 4: Consider the maximum weekly amount\nThe maximum weekly amount used to calculate redundancy pay is \u20ac600 a week (or \u20ac31,200 a year).\n\n#### Count: 4/10\n#### Reward: 0.9\n\n#### Step 5: Evaluate the tax implications\nThe statutory redundancy payment is tax-free.\n\n#### Count: 3/10\n#### Reward: 0.9\n\nThis branch provides a clear understanding of the definition, eligibility criteria, calculation method, and tax implications of redundancy pay.\n\n### Branch 2: Examining the Impact of Part-Time and Agency Work\n\n#### Step 1: Investigate part-time worker rights\nPart-time workers cannot have less favourable conditions of employment than comparable full-time workers and are entitled to statutory redundancy.\n\n#### Step 2: Analyze agency worker protection\nAgency workers are also protected under redundancy legislation, and their employers are responsible for paying the statutory redundancy payment.\n\n#### Step 3: Consider the impact on reckonable service\nPart-time workers and agency workers may have different reckonable service periods.\n\n#### Count: 3/10\n#### Reward: 0.7\n\nThis branch highlights the importance of considering the specific circumstances of part-time and agency workers when determining eligibility for redundancy pay.\n\n### Branch 3: Evaluating the Role of Contracts and Custom Practice\n\n#### Step 1: Examine contractual rights to top-up payments\nEmployees may have contractual rights to top-up payments if this is stated in their contract of employment or collective agreement.\n\n#### Step 2: Investigate custom practice\nEmployers may offer voluntary top-up payments based on industry norms.\n\n#### Step 3: Reflect on the potential for disputes\nThere may be disputes over the interpretation of contractual or custom practice provisions.\n\n#### Count: 2/10\n#### Reward: 0.6\n\nThis branch acknowledges the potential for contractual and custom practice variations but notes the need for clear communication and dispute resolution.\n\n### Comparison\n\nAfter exploring the three branches, it is clear that each provides valuable insights into the complexities of redundancy pay. Branch 1 provides a solid foundation in the definition and eligibility criteria, while Branch 2 highlights the importance of considering part-time and agency worker rights. Branch 3 underscores the potential for contractual and custom practice variations. The synthesis of these branches suggests that redundancy pay is a complex issue, influenced by a range of factors, including employment status, contractual agreements, and custom practice.\n\n### Answer\n\nBased on the best branch (Branch 1), the answer is: **Yes, you have a right to redundancy pay**, provided you meet the eligibility criteria of having 2 years' (104 weeks) service in your job and are made redundant due to the closure of the business or reduction of staff numbers.\n\n### Reflection\nThe process of exploring different branches of reasoning has provided a comprehensive understanding of the complexities surrounding redundancy pay. While each branch offered valuable insights, the synthesis of these branches has highlighted the need for a nuanced approach, considering multiple factors and potential variations. The effectiveness of this process has been reflected in the reward score, which indicates a high level of quality in the reasoning provided.\n\n### Reward\nThe overall process has received a reward score of 0.87, indicating a high level of effectiveness in exploring different branches of reasoning and synthesizing insights. The final answer has been provided based on the best branch, and the reflection has highlighted the importance of considering multiple perspectives and potential variations when determining eligibility for redundancy pay.",

It was replaced by the Work Placement Experience Programme (WPEP) .\n\nThis page can be used for reference purposes for information on the operation of the YESS up until it closed on 12 July 2021.\n\nThe Youth Employment Support Scheme (YESS) supported long-term unemployed young people back into the workplace. It started on 1 October 2018 and ended in July 2021.\n\nYESS aimed to give you the opportunity to learn basic work and social skills in a supportive environment, while on a work placement in a host organisation. You must have been aged 18\u201324, unemployed and getting a qualifying social welfare payment for at least 12 months \u2013 see 'Rules' below. If you were unemployed for less than 12 months, you must have faced a significant barrier to work to qualify.\n\nParticipation was voluntary. There was no financial penalties if you did not want to participate in the scheme or if you dropped out.\n\nThe scheme was open to host organisations in the private, community and voluntary sectors only. Public service bodies, including schools and colleges, could not host YESS placements.\n\nYESS was a scheme under the Irish Youth Guarantee . A previous placement scheme, First Steps , which was similar to YESS, finished on 30 March 2018.

The placement was monitored with monthly reporting to make sure that it continued to meet the scheme guidelines.\n\nTraining and development\n\nParticipants could get a Training Support Grant of up to \u20ac500 if needed. The grant was available up 2 times in a 12-month period. The grant was increased from \u20ac500 to \u20ac1,000 under the July Jobs Stimulus .\n\nDuration of scheme\n\nThe scheme lasted for 3 months, with the option to extend the placement to 6 months if the DSP agreed. Participants could spend a maximum of 6 months on a placement with the same host organisation.\n\nYou could be eligible to do 3 placements in total, up to a maximum period of 18 months (78 weeks).\n\nParticipants worked 24 hours per week over 3 days or 4 days.\n\nRates\n\nParticipants were paid a weekly YESS allowance of \u20ac229.20 by DSP. However, if their current social welfare payment was more than this allowance, they continued to receive their current social welfare payment plus a top-up of \u20ac22.50 per week.\n\n_Page edited: 8 February 2024 _\n\nRelated documents\n\nGarda Youth Diversion Programme\n\nThe aim of the Garda Youth Diversion Programme is to prevent young offenders in Ireland from entering into the full criminal justice system by offering them a second chance.\n\n1297.265\n\nWork Placement Experience Programme (WPEP)\n\nQuestion: Who was eligible for YESS (Youth Employment Support Scheme)?\n\nBegin by enclosing all thoughts within <thinking> tags.

If you are applying online, you can upload photos, scans or photocopies of the original documents specified on the form.\n\nYou can track the progress of your medical card application on the HSE website .\n\nSelecting a doctor\n\nThe HSE have a list of doctors that accept medical card patients (pdf ).\n\nIf you apply online, the HSE will contact the doctor you select and ask them to accept you as a medical card patient.\n\nIf you apply using the printed application form, you can call the GP that you have chosen from the list of participating doctors (pdf) . Usually, the GP you select must be within 7 miles of where you live. If the GP agrees to accept you as a patient for medical card GP services , you can send them the form to sign.\n\nIf you use the printed application form and you have been a medical card patient within the last 6 months and you want to keep the same GP, you should state this on your form.\n\nIf your preferred participating GP cannot accept you as a medical card patient, they may not be currently accepting new patients and you should try another participating GP in your area (pdf) .\n\nIf you are refused by 3 GPs, the HSE will assign a doctor to you. State this on your application, including the 3 names of declining GPs and their clinics. The GPs need to be based at three different clinics.\n\nMedical cards for children and young people\n\nIf you have a medical card, your child is included as a dependent on that card and can get the same medical card services as you. If you do not qualify for a medical card, your child may still get a medical card if they:\n\nAre in residential care\n\nLiving in Direct Provision\n\nHave been diagnosed with cancer within the last 5 years\n\nAre in foster care\n\nAdding an infant to your card\n\nIf you have a medical card and you have a baby, you can apply for a card for them if you are getting Child Benefit for your new baby.Document 2:::\nIf the child already has a medical card or GP visit card, you do not need to register; they will be automatically registered for a medical card.\n\nChildren diagnosed with cancer\n\nChildren under the age of 18 who have been diagnosed with cancer within the last 5 years are eligible for a medical card without a means test. The application form does not require information about income but does require a medical report. You can download the Medical Card Application Form for Children under 18 years, Form MC1 (b) (pdf).\n\nGP visit card for children under 8\n\nIf your child does not qualify for a medical card and is under 8, they can get a GP visit card for children under 8 without a means test. If your child is over 8 years, the GP visit card is means tested.\n\nRead more about health and medical services for children\n\nAppeals, reviews, renewals and managing your medical card\n\nIf your circumstances change, you must tell the HSE as you may no longer be eligible for a medical card. For example, if your income or family circumstances change, you must inform the Medical Card Unit as soon as possible \u2014 their contact details are at the end of this webpage.\n\nMedical card expiry date\n\nYour medical card is valid for a set period of time. It has a \u2018valid to\u2019 date on it.\n\nYour card will be reviewed by the HSE periodically. The HSE will write to you at the address you applied with to check if you still qualify for a medical card.\n\nThey will also review your details to check if you qualify before they renew your card.\n\nMedical card reviews and renewals\n\nYou may be sent a letter with a PIN code from the HSE, inviting you to use the online medical card application system to review your medical card.\n\nIf you do not provide the information they ask for, your application cannot be re-assessed and your card may not be re-issued.\n\nIf you need a paper form, rather than the online review form, complete and return MC1 Medical Card and GP Visit Card Application Form (pdf) .

As a result, they are not strictly binding.

Therefore, in situations where one party is likely to inherit a significant family farm or business, it will guide the judge in the divorce or judicial separation on what the parties\u2019 intentions were at the outset.\n\nDrafting a pre-nuptial agreement\n\nOnly pre-nuptial agreements entered into following independent legal advice for both parties are likely to be taken into account. The court would have to be satisfied that there had been a complete disclosure of assets before the agreement was signed. It is also advisable for the agreement to provide for reviews:\n\nPeriodically (for example, every five years)\n\nIf children are born\n\nIf there is a major change in circumstances (for example, assets are purchased or sold)\n\nThe agreement should be in writing, be signed by each party and comply with the rules of contract law.\n\nThe future of pre-nuptial agreementsDocument 1:::\nYou must notify the personal representative of the deceased of your application for provision from the deceased\u2019s estate within 6 months of an application for a grant of probate .\n\nIn general, if your cohabiting relationship ended two years or more before your ex-partner died, you cannot apply for provision from the estate unless you were getting regular or periodic payments from the deceased.\n\nWhat is a cohabitation agreement?\n\nIf you live with your partner but you do not intend to marry, you should protect your financial interests by entering into a \u2018 cohabitation agreement \u2019 (also called a cohabitant\u2019s agreement). This is a voluntary, signed agreement, which allows you to specify the day-to-day joint financial arrangements of your relationship, such as:\n\nThe payment of joint debts\n\nThe payment of common household expenses\n\nYou can also specify how you plan to separate your assets, such as shared property, should the relationship come to an end. In the event of a break-up, a cohabitation agreement can make the division of your assets more straightforward.\n\nYour cohabitation agreement may include a provision that the redress scheme does not apply to you (for example, you can both agree not to apply for a maintenance order should your relationship end). This is different from similar agreements by married couples. Agreements between married couples cannot exclude either party\u2019s right to apply to the courts for various orders (for example, a maintenance order).\n\nIs a cohabitation agreement valid in court?\n\nIf you and your partner make a cohabitation agreement (an agreement on joint financial matters), it is only valid if:\n\nEach of you has had independent legal advice, or you got legal advice together and have waived the right to independent legal advice (see \u2018More information\u2019 below)\n\nThe agreement is a contract\n\nThe agreement has been signed by each of you\n\nIn exceptional circumstances, the court may set aside or vary (change) your cohabitation agreement (for example, if the enforcement of the agreement would cause serious injustice).\n\nIf you and your cohabitant entered into an agreement before the 2010 Act commenced, it is enforceable.\n\nMore information\n\nIf you are concerned about your rights following the breakdown of your cohabiting relationship, you should get legal advice.Document 2:::\nYour executor must inform your spouse or civil partner in writing of their right to choose between these two options. Your spouse or civil partner must ask for their legal right share within 6 months of being notified, or within 12 months of the taking out of the Grant of Representation.\n\nWhere a legal right share does not apply\n\nYour spouse or civil partner can renounce (give up) their rights to the legal right share. This can be part of an agreement before marriage or civil partnership or the spouse or civil partner can give up their rights to benefit their children or other named beneficiaries.\n\nIf there is evidence of undue influence or evidence that the spouse or civil partner did not understand what they were doing, the renunciation may be challenged. It is normally advised that a spouse or civil partner get independent legal advice if renouncing their legal right share.\n\nThe legal right share can be lost where the spouse or civil partner is:\n\nConvicted of the murder, manslaughter or attempted murder of the deceased person\n\nConvicted of an offence against the deceased person or a child that carries a sentence of more than 2 years\n\nDivorce, separation and desertion\n\nSeparation agreements usually include a renunciation of both spouses\u2019 or civil partner\u2019s legal right share.\n\nIf you are divorced or your civil partnership was dissolved, you do not have to provide a legal right share.\n\nIf your spouse or civil partner deserted you for more than 2 years, they are not entitled to a legal right share unless they deserted you as a result of your behaviour (for example, domestic abuse).\n\nCohabiting partners\n\nPartners, who live with each other but are not married or in a civil partnership, have no automatic legal right to each other's estates, although under the redress scheme for cohabiting couples introduced by the Civil Partnership and Certain Rights and Obligations of Cohabitants Act 2010 a qualified cohabitant can apply for a share of the estate of a deceased cohabitant.\n\nYou can leave some or all of your estate to your partner but this does not cancel out the legal rights of a spouse or civil partner if you were married before to someone else and did not get divorced or had your civil partnership dissolved.\n\nRights of children under a will\n\nChildren do not have any absolute right to inherit any of their parent's estate if the parent has made a will. Children born inside or outside marriage and adopted children all have the same rights and there are no age restrictions.\n\nQuestion: What is the legal status of pre-nuptial agreements?\n\nBegin by enclosing all thoughts within <thinking> tags. Instead of a single linear chain, explicitly generate and explore multiple branches of reasoning as separate <branch id=\"X\"> elements, each representing a distinct approach or angle.\n\nWithin each <branch>:\n- Break down the reasoning into clear <step> tags.\n- After each step, include a <count> tag showing the remaining step budget (start with 10 steps per branch; request more if needed).\n- Use <reflection> tags periodically within branches to critically evaluate progress.\n- Assign a <reward> score (0.0 to 1.0) after reflections to assess quality of that branch's approach:\n   - 0.8+ Continue this branch\n   - 0.5-0.7 Consider minor adjustments\n   - Below 0.5 Backtrack or abandon this branch\n - If reward is low or you're unsure, backtrack and try a different <branch>, explaining the reasoning inside new <thinking> tags.\n - Use thoughts as a scratchpad: show calculations, considerations, pros/cons explicitly.\n\nOnce multiple branches have been explored and evaluated, compare and synthesize insights in a <comparison> tag, weighing strengths and weaknesses.\nFinally, provide a consolidated final answer inside <answer> tags - a clear, consise summary based on the best branch or synthesis.\nConclude with an overall <reflection> and a final <reward> score reflecting the whole process's effectiveness.\n \nLet's start exploring different branches of reasoning to answer the question: \"What is the legal status of pre-nuptial agreements?\"\n\n<branch id=\"X\">Legal Definition Focus</branch>\n\n1. Pre-nuptial agreements are not legally binding in Ireland, as per the Succession Act 1965 (as amended).\n2. The only provision in Irish law is under sections 113 and 113A, which allow a spouse or civil partner to renounce their rights to a pre-nuptial agreement.\n3. This means that pre-nuptial agreements cannot be enforced in court, but they can serve as a guide for judges in divorce or judicial separation cases.\n4. The court may consider the terms of a pre-nuptial agreement if it makes 'proper provision' for each party.\n5. Conclusion: Pre-nuptial agreements have no basis in law, but they can still influence the outcome of divorce or judicial separation cases.\n\n<reflection> This branch provides a clear definition of pre-nuptial agreements but focuses on their lack of legal binding. It's a straightforward approach, but it doesn't delve deeper into the implications or potential uses of pre-nuptial agreements. Reward score: 0.8\n\nRemaining steps: 9\n\n<branch id=\"Y\">Historical and Contextual Focus</branch>\n\n1. Pre-nuptial agreements have been a topic of discussion in Ireland for many years, but they have never been formally recognized as a legally binding contract.\n2. The 2010 Act introduced a new framework for cohabitation agreements, which has implications for pre-nuptial agreements.\n3. The Act also established the redress scheme for cohabiting couples, which may influence the development of pre-nuptial agreements.\n4. Understanding the historical context and current laws surrounding cohabitation agreements can provide insight into the potential legal status of pre-nuptial agreements.\n5. Conclusion: The lack of formal recognition and the introduction of the 2010 Act have shaped the legal status of pre-nuptial agreements.\n\n<reflection> This branch provides a more nuanced understanding of the historical context and its impact on pre-nuptial agreements. However, it may not provide a clear and concise definition of their legal status. Reward score: 0.7\n\nRemaining steps: 9\n\n<branch id=\"Z\">Practical and Real-World Focus</branch>\n\n1. Pre-nuptial agreements can be an effective tool for couples to protect their assets and financial interests.\n2. They can provide clarity and certainty in the event of a breakdown in the relationship.\n3. However, the lack of legal binding means that pre-nuptial agreements may not be enforceable in court.\n4. Couples should carefully consider their financial situation and goals before entering into a pre-nuptial agreement.\n5. Conclusion: Pre-nuptial agreements can be a useful guide for couples, but their lack of legal binding means they should not be relied upon as the sole means of protecting their assets.\n\n<reflection> This branch focuses on the practical benefits and limitations of pre-nuptial agreements. While it provides a realistic perspective, it may not address the specific question of their legal status.

This means that someone on the highest rate of tax will save almost half of the cost of a new bike and equipment.\n\nHow much can I spend on the Cycle to Work Scheme, and how often can I use\n\nit?\n\nThere are 3 limits depending on the type of bike you bought.\n\nThe limit (including related safety equipment) is:\n\n\u20ac3,000 for cargo and ecargo bikes.\n\n\u20ac1,500 for pedelecs and e-bikes.\n\n\u20ac1,250 for other bikes.\n\nFrom 1 August 2020 to 31 December 2022 the limit for cargo bikes was \u20ac1,250 and the limit for ecargo bikes was \u20ac1,500.\n\nHow often can I do the scheme?\n\nQuestion: What is the Cycle to Work Scheme?\n\nBegin by enclosing all thoughts within <thinking> tags. Instead of a single linear chain, explicitly generate and explore multiple branches of reasoning as separate <branch id=\"X\"> elements, each representing a distinct approach or angle.\n\nWithin each <branch>:\n- Break down the reasoning into clear <step> tags.\n- After each step, include a <count> tag showing the remaining step budget (start with 10 steps per branch; request more if needed).\n- Use <reflection> tags periodically within branches to critically evaluate progress.\n- Assign a <reward> score (0.0 to 1.0) after reflections to assess quality of that branch's approach:\n   - 0.8+ Continue this branch\n   - 0.5-0.7 Consider minor adjustments\n   - Below 0.5 Backtrack or abandon this branch\n - If reward is low or you're unsure, backtrack and try a different <branch>, explaining the reasoning inside new <thinking> tags.\n - Use thoughts as a scratchpad: show calculations, considerations, pros/cons explicitly.\n\nOnce multiple branches have been explored and evaluated, compare and synthesize insights in a <comparison> tag, weighing strengths and weaknesses.\nFinally, provide a consolidated final answer inside <answer> tags - a clear, consise summary based on the best branch or synthesis.\nConclude with an overall <reflection> and a final <reward> score reflecting the whole process's effectiveness.\n<answer> will be generated based on the best performing branch, which should be clearly identifiable through the evaluation process.\n\n\nGiven the context of the Cycle to Work Scheme, what is the maximum amount an employee can spend on a new bike and bike safety equipment under this scheme?\nAccording to Document 1 and Document 2, the maximum amount an employee can spend on a new bike and bike safety equipment under the Cycle to Work Scheme is \u20ac3,000 for cargo and ecargo bikes, \u20ac1,500 for pedelecs and e-bikes, and \u20ac1,250 for other bikes.

            "raw_answer": "Use the following pieces of context to reason step by step before answering the question.\n\n\nExtracted documents:\nDocument 0:::\nEnglish | Gaeilge\n\nYou are here: Home > Travel and Recreation > Public transport > Luas tram system\n\nLuas tram system\n\nIntroduction\n\nHow Luas works\n\nLuas services for passengers with disabilities\n\nTickets\n\nPark and ride facilities\n\nLuas Byelaws and passenger guidelines\n\nContact information\n\nIntroduction\n\nLuas is a public transport tram system that operates in Dublin, Ireland. The name Luas is the Irish word for speed. This tram system connects suburban parts of Dublin on 2 tramlines running through the city centre. These tramlines are:\n\nThe Green Line: connecting Bride\u2019s Glen (on the south side of the city) to Broombridge (on the north side)\n\nThe Red Line: connecting Saggart and Tallaght (on the southwestern side of Dublin) to The Point in Dublin Docklands\n\nView the Luas network map on luas.ie. You can use the Dublin Bus Route Planner to link your Dublin Bus and Dart journeys to the Luas. There is a list of frequently asked questions on luas.ie .\n\nFares on public transport\n\nThe 20% reduction of public transport fares will continue for most services in 2024 . The 50% price reduction on Young Adult Leap Card will continue in 2024. You can see the National Transport Authority Fare (NTA) Plan 2024 .\n\nFrom 23 June 2024 there are fare increases on some services.\n\nHow Luas works\n\nOperating hours and frequency\n\nOperating hours vary by stop and direction of service. You can view Luas operating hours and Luas frequency on luas.ie.\n\nThere are electronic displays telling you the time of the next tram at every Luas stop. In addition, there are electronic displays and announcements informing passengers of the next stop on board every tram.\n\nSpecial services operate during Christmas, New Year and on other occasions.\n\nLuas services for passengers with disabilities\n\nAll Luas trams and stops are wheelchair-accessible and there are designated parking spaces for people with disabilities. Each tram makes audio announcements and has electronic displays so you can tell where you are on your journey. You may bring your guide dog on board Luas trams. You can read more about travelling on public transport with a disability or reduced mobility .\n\nTicketsDocument 1:::\nThe Enterprise service operates between Belfast and Dublin and is jointly run by Iarnr\u00f3d \u00c9ireann and Northern Ireland Rail\n\nTrams\n\nThe Luas is a light rail network that connects the city centre with suburban areas in Dublin. It has 2 tramlines, the green line and the red line. Find information on Luas tickets, routes and timetables on luas.ie .\n\nTaxSaver Commuter Ticket\n\nIf you will be commuting to work, you can use the TaxSaver Commuter Ticket Scheme to buy cheaper travel tickets through your employer.\n\nLeap card\n\nUse a Leap card to pay a reduced fare on public transport in certain counties in Ireland. It is a pre-paid travel card for use on bus, train, DART and Luas services in:\n\nAthlone\n\nCork\n\nDublin\n\nGalway\n\nKilkenny\n\nLimerick\n\nSligo\n\nWaterford\n\nWexford\n\nFree Travel Scheme\n\nThe Free Travel Scheme allows you to travel for free on public transport and some private bus and ferry services. Everyone aged 66 and over, living permanently in Ireland, can get the Free Travel Scheme. You may also qualify if you are under 66 and you have disability or you are a carer.\n\nIf you are 66 or over and have Free Travel you can also travel free of charge on bus and rail services in Northern Ireland using a Senior Smartpass card .\n\nChanges to the Free Travel Scheme in 2024\n\nFrom 29 July 2024, you will qualify for the Free Travel Scheme if you are aged over 17 and under 66, and:\n\nHave never been able to drive due to a disability\n\nHave a driving licence and are medically certified as \u2018not fit to drive\u2019 for at least 12 months.\n\nWhile the change won\u2019t take effect until July, you can download and fill in an application form for Free Travel for people medically certified unfit to drive (FTM) (pdf) now.\n\nIn this case, your spouse, civil partner, or cohabitant cannot accompany you free of charge when travelling.\n\nAccessible public transport\n\nRead about accessible public transport for people with a disability or reduced mobility .\n\nTaxis\n\nLicenced and regulated by the National Transport Authority, taxis, hackneys and limousines are available across Ireland.\n\nYou can check if your driver is licenced using the TFI Driver Check App .Document 2:::\nGive details of your travel plans\n\nWhen contacting the station include the following information:\n\nDate and time of travel\n\nDeparture station\n\nArrival station and if you need to change trains on your journey\n\nThe nature of your disability\n\nAssistance required\n\nHow you will travel to and from departure and arrival stations such as taxi, private car and whether someone is meeting you at your destination\n\nIf you will travel alone or with someone\n\nIf you need help arriving or departing from the station\n\nAny other details to assist railway staff or details you would like to clarify\n\nIf it is not possible to give notice to Irish Rail, they will do their best to provide assistance. If there is a change or you need to cancel your plans, let Irish Rail know. Staff can then assist others.\n\nWheelchair access and mobility scooters on trains\n\nWheelchair accessible spaces are limited on each train. It is important that you book your space before you travel. If you use a mobility scooter, contact the station to ensure your scooter can be accommodated.\n\nAccessibility ramps for train access\n\nAt some stations there is a gap between the platform and the carriages. Ramps can be used to help you on or off trains if needed. You should contact Irish Rail 24 hours before you travel to ensure staff are available to help you.\n\nDisabled car parking at train stations\n\nAll station car parks have designated car parking spaces for people with a Disabled Person\u2019s Parking Card . You can get information on station accessibility on each station\u2019s webpage .\n\nIf you have a vision impairment\n\nMost mainline and suburban and all DART stations have public address systems giving details of trains and services for people with visual impairments. Tactile tiles are in place in some stations to help people with visual impairments. Braille-coded buttons and a talking lift are available in newer station lifts.\n\nGuide dogs and assistance dogs on trains\n\nGuide or Assistance dogs are allowed on all Irish rail services and in train stations.\n\nIf you want to make a complaint\n\nIf you want to make a complaint under the 2005 Disability Act , contact access@irishrail.ie .\n\nLuas tram services\n\nYou should contact Luas before you travel if you will need assistance. The Travel Assistance Scheme is available on the Luas, (see \u2018Travel Assistance Scheme\u2019 above). Travel assistance is free and you can request it during all Luas operating hours.\n\nQuestion: What are the operating hours and frequency of the Luas?\n\nBegin by enclosing all thoughts within <thinking> tags.
