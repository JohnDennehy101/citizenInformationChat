It can also be used to renovate vacant and derelict properties that have not been used as residential properties before. However, this only applies if the non-residential properties were used for commercial or public use before and now have the correct planning permission. You can get the grant if you are refurbishing the vacant property so you can live there, or so you can rent the property out. You can get a grant of up to \u20ac50,000 to renovate a vacant property and up to \u20ac70,000, if the property is derelict. You can get more if you are living on an off-shore island. And, there is an additional grant for expert conservation advice if you are refurbishing a vacant traditional farmhouse. The Vacant Property Refurbishment Grant is funded by the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage through the Cro\u00ed C\u00f3naithe (Towns) Fund and you apply to your local authority. If you have questions about the grant or want to know if your property qualifies, you can: Read the FAQs about the grant Contact the Vacant Homes Officer in your local authority Contact the Housing Agency's Vacancy Helpline on vacancycampaign@housingagency.ie You can also find information on how to re-use old and vacant buildings in the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage\u2019s Bringing Back Homes (pdf) manual.",

This means that if you have a pre-nuptial agreement in place and you end up in court following the breakdown of your marriage, the judge is not bound by the terms of the pre-nuptial agreement. The only provision in Irish law is under sections 113 and 113A of the Succession Act 1965 (as amended) where a spouse or a civil partner can renounce his/her legal right share in a pre-nuptial agreement. Although they are not legally binding, there is nothing in Irish law which stops a couple planning to marry from having and signing a pre-nuptial agreement. Importantly, such agreements can serve as guides for the courts in judicial separation and divorce cases. If a pre-nuptial agreement makes \u2018proper provision\u2019 for each person it is more likely to be persuasive on the judge. Therefore, in situations where one party is likely to inherit a significant family farm or business, it will guide the judge in the divorce or judicial separation on what the parties\u2019 intentions were at the outset.",

The Scheme's primary goal is to help employees save for major purchases without having to pay income tax on the savings. The Scheme offers several benefits, including tax-free savings, repayment through payroll deductions, no interest or fees, and flexibility to use the savings for any major purchase. However, the Scheme has some limitations, including the requirement for employees to have a specific purchase in mind and the limitation to major purchases only.\n\n### <reflection>\nThe Cycle to Work Scheme is a useful tool for employees who need to save for major purchases, but it may not be suitable for all employees. The Scheme's benefits and limitations should be carefully considered before using it.\n\n### <reward>0.9> \nFinal Reward Score: 0.9/1.0\n\nThe final answer is: The Cycle to Work Scheme is a government-backed initiative that allows employees to save up to \u00a33,000 in a cycle of tax-free savings and repay it through payroll deductions when they need it.",
