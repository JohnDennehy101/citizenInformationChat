Redundancy refers to the duplication of effort or resources, which can be considered redundant if it adds no value or serves no purpose. To identify genuine redundancy, we need to examine the value added by each element or process in the system. In this case, we are looking for elements that could be eliminated without affecting the overall system's performance or functionality. Here are some key factors to consider:\n\n1.  **Identify the system's primary function**: Understand the main purpose of the system and what it is intended to achieve.\n2.  **Analyze each element's contribution**: Evaluate each component or process to determine its role and impact on the system's overall performance.\n",

This means that if you have a pre-nuptial agreement in place and you end up in court following the breakdown of your marriage, the judge is not bound by the terms of the pre-nuptial agreement. The only provision in Irish law is under sections 113 and 113A of the Succession Act 1965 (as amended) where a spouse or a civil partner can renounce his/her legal right share in a pre-nuptial agreement. Although they are not legally binding, there is nothing in Irish law which stops a couple planning to marry from having and signing a pre-nuptial agreement. Importantly, such agreements can serve as guides for the courts in judicial separation and divorce cases. If a pre-nuptial agreement makes \u2018proper provision\u2019 for each person it is more likely to be persuasive on the judge.
