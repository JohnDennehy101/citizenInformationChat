This means that if you have a pre-nuptial agreement in place and you end up in court following the breakdown of your marriage, the judge is not bound by the terms of the pre-nuptial agreement. The only provision in Irish law is under sections 113 and 113A of the Succession Act 1965 (as amended) where a spouse or a civil partner can renounce his/her legal right share in a pre-nuptial agreement. Although they are not legally binding, there is nothing in Irish law which stops a couple planning to marry from having and signing a pre-nuptial agreement. Importantly, such agreements can serve as guides for the courts in judicial separation and divorce cases. If a pre-nuptial agreement makes \u2018proper provision\u2019 for each person it is more likely to be persuasive on the judge. Therefore, in situations where one party is likely to inherit a significant family farm or business, it will guide the judge in the divorce or judicial separation on what the parties\u2019 intentions were at the outset.",

If more steps become necessary, indicate where each branch could use additional exploration in <remaining_steps> labels. Remember to add a unique branch identifier (A or B) to differentiate the two. The solution presented below assumes the data will be obtained from an online source. Adapt the approach as necessary in the case of other information sources. Also note that the rewards provided are for illustrative purposes. Actual reward assessments will depend on individual criteria and judgment. Good luck!\n```\n<thought>\n  I will search for the operational hours of Luam Red and Green lines, as well",
