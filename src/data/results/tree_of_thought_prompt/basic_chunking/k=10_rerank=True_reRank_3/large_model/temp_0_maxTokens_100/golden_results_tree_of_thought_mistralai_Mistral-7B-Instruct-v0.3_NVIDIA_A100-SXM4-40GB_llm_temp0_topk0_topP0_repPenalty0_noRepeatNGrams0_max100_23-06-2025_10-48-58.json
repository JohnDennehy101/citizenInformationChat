This means that if you have a pre-nuptial agreement in place and you end up in court following the breakdown of your marriage, the judge is not bound by the terms of the pre-nuptial agreement. The only provision in Irish law is under sections 113 and 113A of the Succession Act 1965 (as amended) where a spouse or a civil partner can renounce his/her legal right share in a pre-nuptial agreement. Although they are not legally binding, there is nothing in Irish law which stops a couple planning to marry from having and signing a pre-nuptial agreement. Importantly, such agreements can serve as guides for the courts in judicial separation and divorce cases. If a pre-nuptial agreement makes \u2018proper provision\u2019 for each person it is more likely to be persuasive on the judge.

Instead of a single linear chain, explicitly generate and explore multiple branches of reasoning as separate <branch id=\"X\"> elements, each representing a distinct approach or angle.\n\nWithin each <branch>:\n - Break down the reasoning into clear <step> tags.\n - After each step, include a <count> tag showing the remaining step budget (start with 10 steps per branch; request more if needed).\n - Use <reflection> tags periodically within branches to critically evaluate progress.\n - Assign a <reward> score (0.0 to 1.0) after reflections to assess quality of that branch's approach:\n   - 0.8+ Continue this branch\n   - 0.5-0.7 Consider minor adjustments\n   - Below 0.5 Backtrack or abandon this branch\n - If reward is low or you're unsure, backtrack and try a different <branch>, explaining the reasoning inside new <thinking> tags.\n - Use thoughts as a scratchpad: show calculations, considerations, pros/cons explicitly.\n\nOnce multiple branches have been explored and evaluated, compare and synthesize insights in a <comparison> tag, weighing strengths and weaknesses.\nFinally, provide a consolidated final answer inside <answer> tags - a clear, consise summary based on the best branch or synthesis.\nConclude with an overall <reflection> and a final <reward> score reflecting the whole process's effectiveness.\n",
