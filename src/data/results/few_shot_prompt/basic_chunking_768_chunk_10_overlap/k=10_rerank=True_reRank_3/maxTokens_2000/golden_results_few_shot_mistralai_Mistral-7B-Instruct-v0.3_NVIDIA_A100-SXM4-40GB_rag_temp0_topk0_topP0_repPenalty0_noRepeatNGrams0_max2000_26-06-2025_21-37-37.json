Before 1 January 2005, everyone born on the island of Ireland was an Irish citizen by birth. Following an amendment to the Constitution of Ireland , citizenship by birth is no longer an automatic entitlement to everyone born on the island of Ireland.\n\nIf you are born abroad, you are entitled to Irish citizenship if your parent was born in Ireland. If your grandparents were born in Ireland, you may also be able to claim citizenship through the Foreign Births Register .\n\nResidents of Ireland who have come from abroad can apply to become Irish citizens through naturalisation .\n\nCitizens of Ireland are also EU citizens, which means that they can live, work and study in any other EU member state.\n\nThis page describes who can claim or apply for Irish citizenship, the rights that Irish citizens enjoy and answers some general questions on Irish citizenship law.\n\nIrish citizenship and the law\n\nIrish citizenship in the Constitution of Ireland\n\nThe Constitution of Ireland is the basic law of the State and was adopted in 1937. It replaced the Constitution of the Irish Free State .\n\nThe Constitution of the Irish Free State granted citizenship to anyone living in the territory of the Irish Free State who:\n\nAt the time of the enacting of the constitution lived in the territory of the Irish Free State\n\nand\n\nWas born in Ireland, or was the son or daughter of someone who was born in Ireland or\n\nLived in Ireland for 7 years or more\n\nIt did not give citizenship rights to anyone born after the enacting of the Constitution of the Irish Free State. Instead, it said that this would be set out in law.\n\nWhen this was replaced by the Constitution of Ireland , anyone who was granted citizenship of the Irish Free State under the provisions of the previous Constitution became a citizen of Ireland. Article 9 of the Irish Constitution says that the future \u201cacquisition and loss\u201d of Irish citizenship would be done in accordance with law.\n\nThe 19th Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland was passed following the Good Friday Agreement in 1998. This put the right to citizenship by birth in the Constitution.\n\nThe 27th Amendment of the Irish Constitution was passed by referendum in 2004. This removed the automatic right to citizenship by birth for anyone born in Ireland after 1 January 2005 and gave authority back to the Oireachtas (the Irish parliament) to decide on laws about citizenship by birth.\n\nThe Irish Nationality and Citizenship Acts\n\nThe Constitution of Ireland allows the Oireachtas to make laws to decide who can become an Irish citizen after the enactment of the Constitution (in 1937). The most important citizenship law that was passed after 1937 was the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act of 1956 .\n\nThis Act had a number of important provisions:\n\nAnyone born in Ireland was automatically an Irish citizen. People who were born in Northern Ireland were entitled to be Irish citizens if they chose it.\n\nA Foreign Births Register was established for descendants of Irish citizens born abroad.Document 1:::\nEnglish | Gaeilge\n\nYou are here: Home > Moving Country > Irish citizenship\n\nIrish citizenship\n\nEntitlement to Irish citizenship\n\nWhat is Irish citizenship and who can become an Irish citizen?\n\nIrish citizenship through birth or descent\n\nYou are not automatically an Irish citizen if you were born on the island of Ireland. You may be entitled to Irish citizenship if your parent(s) or grandparents were Irish. You may be entitled to Irish citizenship if you were born outside of Ireland, but you may need to register your birth.\n\nBecoming an Irish citizen through naturalisation\n\nNaturalisation is the process through which a foreign national can become an Irish citizen. Find out more about who is eligible to become an Irish citizen through naturalisation and how to apply.\n\nThe Foreign Births Register\n\nIf your grandparents were born in Ireland, but you were born abroad, your birth must be registered in the Foreign Births Register to claim Irish citizenship. This document explains how to do this.\n\nMost Read in \"Irish citizenship\"\n\nIrish citizenship through birth or descent\n\nBecoming an Irish citizen through naturalisation\n\nThe Foreign Births Register\n\nEntitlement to Irish citizenshipDocument 2:::\n4. Born in Ireland with no right to citizenship of another country\n\nIf none of the above applies to you and you were born in Ireland, but you are not entitled to citizenship of any other country, you are an Irish citizen by birth.\n\nIrish citizenship when you are born abroad\n\nIf either of your parents was born in Ireland and was an Irish citizen at the time of your birth, you are automatically an Irish citizen by birth.\n\nIf the parent through whom you are entitled to Irish citizenship was deceased at the time of your birth, but would have been an Irish citizen if alive at that time, you are also an Irish citizen.\n\nIrish citizen parent born outside Ireland\n\nIf you were born outside of Ireland and your parent (who was also born outside of Ireland) was an Irish citizen or entitled to be an Irish citizen at the time of your birth, then you are entitled to become an Irish citizen.\n\nTo claim Irish citizenship, you must have your birth registered in the Foreign Births Register , unless your parent was abroad in the public service at the time of your birth. If you are entitled to register, your Irish citizenship is effective from the date of registration \u2013 not from the date when you were born.\n\nCitizenship through descent from Irish grandparent\n\nIf one of your grandparents was born in Ireland, but neither of your parents was born in Ireland, you may become an Irish citizen. You will need to have your birth registered in the Foreign Births Register .\n\nThe following table may help to explain the situation:\n\n| If you are: | Then you are: ---|---|--- A | Born in the island of Ireland on or before 31 December 2004 | Entitled to Irish citizenship or you are an Irish citizen B | Born on the island of Ireland on or after 1 January 2005 | Entitled to Irish citizenship if one or both of your parents: Is Irish Is British or entitled to live in Northern Ireland or the Irish State without restriction on their residency Is a foreign national legally resident in the island of Ireland for 3 out of 4 years immediately prior to your birth C | Child of A, born outside the island of Ireland | An Irish citizen D | Child of C and a grandchild of A, born outside the island of Ireland | Entitled to Irish citizenship, but you must first register in the Foreign Births Register E | a child of D and a great-grandchild of A, born outside the island of Ireland | Entitled to Irish citizenship, by having your birth registered in the Foreign Births Register, but only if your parent D had registered by the time of your birth.\n\nOther Irish ancestors\n\nUnless at least one parent or an Irish-born grandparent was an Irish citizen at the time of your birth, you have no automatic right to Irish citizenship on the basis of extended previous ancestry (that is, ancestors other than your parents or grandparents). In addition, you cannot claim Irish citizenship on the basis that a relation such as a cousin, aunt or uncle was an Irish citizen if none of your parents or grandparents was an Irish citizen at the time of your birth.\n\nYou can, however, apply for citizenship based on Irish associations, which is at the discretion of the Minister. Irish association means that you are related by blood or through adoption to an Irish citizen.\n\nIf you are considering making an application based on Irish descent or association, you should note the following:\n\nYou should have a reasonable period of legal residence in Ireland (at least 3 years) to show that you have a connection to Ireland.\n\nApplications based on descent from an Irish citizen going further back than a great-grandparent are generally refused.Document 3:::\nEnglish | Gaeilge\n\nYou are here: Home > Moving Country > Irish citizenship > Irish citizenship through birth or descent\n\nIrish citizenship through birth or descent\n\nIntroduction\n\nWho is an Irish citizen by birth?\n\nIrish citizenship when you are born abroad\n\nIrish citizenship through adoption\n\nCitizenship through special declaration\n\nFurther information and contacts\n\nIntroduction\n\nIf you or your parents were born in Ireland, or if you were adopted in Ireland, you may be an Irish citizen by birth.\n\nIf you are not entitled to Irish citizenship by birth, you may be able to become an Irish citizen by registering your birth on the Foreign Births Register , or by applying for naturalisation .\n\nYou can read about citizenship law in Ireland.\n\nWho is an Irish citizen by birth?\n\nYou are entitled to be an Irish citizen by birth if you fall into one of the categories below.\n\n1.

There is a specific definition of residence for tax purposes depending on how many days you spend in the country. If you are not resident in a particular year, Ireland can still be your \u2018ordinary residence\u2019 since this term refers to the country where you are usually resident over a number of years. The country that is your permanent home is known as your domicile .\n\nResidence for tax purposes\n\nYour residence for tax purposes depends on the number of days that you are present in Ireland during a tax year. A tax year runs from 1 January to 31 December.\n\nYou are resident for tax purposes for a year if:\n\nYou spend 183 days or more in Ireland in that year or,\n\nIf you spend 280 days or more in Ireland over a period of 2 consecutive tax years, you will be regarded as resident for the second tax year. For example, if you spend 140 days here in Year 1 and 150 days here in Year 2, you will be resident in Ireland for Year 2. You must be in Ireland for a minimum of 31 days each year.\n\nYou are treated as being present in Ireland for a day if you are present at any time during that day.\n\nChoosing to be resident for tax purposes\n\nIf you arrive in Ireland in a particular year but do not have the required number of days for tax purposes, you can still choose to be resident for that year if you will be resident in the following year.\n\nYou must inform Revenue in writing if you choose to be tax resident in Ireland in a tax year. Contact Revenue for details.\n\nOrdinary residence\n\nYour pattern of residence over a number of years is taken into account to decide your \u2018ordinary residence\u2019.\n\nIf you have been resident for the previous 3 tax years, then you become ordinarily resident from the start of the fourth year. If you leave the country, you will continue to be ordinarily resident until you have been non- resident for 3 continuous tax years. See revenue.ie for more information on ordinary residence .\n\nResidence and married couples or civil partners\n\nFor a married couple or civil partners, the residence status of each spouse is assessed independently of the other. It is possible for one spouse or civil partner to be resident and the other to be non-resident. . If you are resident and your spouse is not, you are treated as single for tax purposes.\n\nHowever, if you are resident and employed in Ireland but your spouse or civil partner is not resident in Ireland and has no income - so that your earnings are the only source of income - then it may be possible to claim the Married or Civil Partner's Tax Credit and the increased tax rate band . You can do this after the end of the tax year when you file a return of income which includes a declaration about your spouse or civil partner's income.\n\nWhat is domicile in Ireland?\n\nYour domicile is the country where you live with the intention of remaining there permanently. It may be different to your residence or nationality.\n\nWhen you are born, you have a domicile of origin . This domicile can be changed to a domicile of choice, if you move to a different country with the intention of living there permanently.Document 1:::\nEnglish | Gaeilge\n\nYou are here: Home > Money and Tax > Tax > Moving country and taxation\n\nMoving country and taxation\n\nTax residence and domicile in Ireland\n\nThere is a specific definition of residence for tax purposes and it depends on how many days you spend in the country.

These rights are called \u2018derivative rights\u2019 of residence. They are important in situations where an EEA or Swiss parent does not have a legal right to reside based on their own activities, or a Non-EEA citizen cannot apply for a residence card based on the activities of their EEA or Swiss spouse or partner.\n\nA Non-EEA citizen can apply for residence based on a derivative right, or an EEA or Swiss citizen can derive a legal right of residence in the State, which could be important for claiming a social welfare payment or access to local authority housing.\n\nA person with derivative rights does not automatically qualify for permanent residence.\n\nThis table has examples of cases where a derivative right of residence was granted by the CJEU, and explains who can claim residence based on the CJEU decision.Document 3:::\nEnglish | Gaeilge\n\nYou are here: Home > Social Welfare > Irish social welfare system\n\nSocial assistance payments > The habitual residence condition\n\nThe habitual residence condition\n\nIntroduction\n\nWhat does habitually resident mean?\n\nRules for satisfying the habitual residence condition\n\nExemption from the habitual residence condition\n\nReturning Irish emigrants\n\nDocuments you need\n\nAppealing a decision on habitual residency\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe social welfare system in Ireland is divided into three main types of payments. These are:\n\nSocial insurance payments: (for example, Jobseeker's Benefit )\n\nMeans-tested payments or social assistance payments: (for example, Jobseeker's Allowance )\n\nUniversal payments: (for example, Child Benefit )\n\nWith all social welfare payments in Ireland, you must satisfy the rules for each scheme to qualify. You must also be habitually resident in Ireland to qualify for the following payments:\n\nBack to Work Family Dividend\n\nBlind Pension\n\nCarer's Allowance\n\nChild Benefit\n\nDisability Allowance\n\nDomiciliary Care Allowance\n\nGuardian's Payment (Non-Contributory)\n\nJobseeker's Allowance and Jobseeker's Allowance Transitional payment\n\nOne-Parent Family Payment\n\nState Pension (Non-Contributory)\n\nSupplementary Welfare Allowance\n\nWidow's, Widower's or Surviving Civil Partner's (Non-Contributory) Pension\n\nUK citizens\n\nResidence in the Common Travel Area is treated the same way as residence in Ireland for the purposes of the habitual residence condition (HRC). However, UK citizens who have recently moved to Ireland may find it more difficult to establish that their main centre of interest is in Ireland.\n\nPeople from Ukraine\n\nPeople who have come from Ukraine and who are covered by the Temporary Protection Directive will satisfy the Habitual Residence Condition.\n\nWhat does habitually resident mean?\n\nThe term habitually resident is not defined in Irish law. In practice it means that you have a proven close link to Ireland. The term also conveys permanence - that a person has been here for some time and intends to stay here for the foreseeable future. Proving you are habitually resident relies heavily on fact. If you have lived in Ireland all your life, you will probably have no difficulty showing that you satisfy the factors which indicate habitual residence \u2013 see list below.\n\nYour spouse, civil partner or cohabitant and any dependent children you have are not required to satisfy the habitual residence condition in their own right. So if you apply for a social welfare payment only you, the applicant, have to satisfy the habitual residence condition.\n\nThe Department of Social Protection has published comprehensive Operational Guidelines on the habitual residence condition .

Your employer should apply selection criteria that are reasonable and are applied in a fair way.\n\nYou are made redundant on maternity leave\n\nYou cannot be made redundant while on maternity leave or additional maternity leave . You may be made redundant when you return to work or while you are pregnant before you go on maternity leave.\n\nIf you are selected for redundancy because you are pregnant, you may be able to bring a claim for unfair dismissal. Selection for redundancy based on certain grounds such as pregnancy is considered unfair under the unfair dismissals legislation.\n\nYou are made redundant on carer\u2019s leave\n\nIf you are dismissed on grounds of redundancy, while on carer\u2019s leave , under the Carer\u2019s Leave Act 2001 it would be considered unfair dismissal.\n\nIf your employer does not allow you to return to work at the end of your carer\u2019s leave you may be able to bring a claim under the unfair dismissals legislation. However you may be made redundant after you have returned to work.\n\nI think I was unfairly selected or there wasn\u2019t a genuine redundancy\n\nsituation\n\nIf you feel that your employer has selected you unfairly, or that there was no genuine redundancy situation, you can bring a claim for unfair dismissal.\n\nYou think you were unfairly selected\n\nYour employer should use fair and reasonable selection criteria in choosing people to make redundant.\n\nExamples where your selection could be unfair include:\n\nWhere the custom and practice in your workplace has been last in, first out and your selection did not follow this procedure\n\nWhere your employment contract sets out criteria for selection which were not followed\n\nYour redundancy is unfair if your employer has discriminated in selecting you for redundancy. For example if they make you redundant because you\u2019re pregnant or on maternity leave.\n\nYour employer could also have chosen you for an unfair reason. Unfair reasons include making you redundant because you\u2019ve asked for one of your legal rights, made a health and safety complaint or been on an official strike.\n\nYou think there was no genuine redundancy situation\n\nA genuine redundancy is one where your employer has a real business reason to make you redundant.\n\nSigns your redundancy might not be a genuine include:Document 2:::\nCompulsory redundancy\n\nCompulsory redundancy is where your employer needs to reduce the workforce and decides to make redundancies. The employer identifies which employees will be made redundant but must make sure they use fair selection criteria.\n\nNon-compulsory redundancy\n\nNon-compulsory redundancy can be through voluntary redundancy or early retirement.\n\nVoluntary redundancy\n\nThis is where your employer needs to reduce the workforce and asks employees if they would like to volunteer for redundancy.\n\nThere must be a fair and transparent selection process. You may not automatically be selected just because you applied.\n\nEarly retirement\n\nThis is where your employer offers incentives to retire early. You are typically allowed to start receiving some pension payments earlier than you would have in a normal retirement situation. It can be used as an alternative to voluntary redundancy.\n\nCollective redundancies\n\nYou may be part of a collective redundancy if your employer is making a certain number of employees redundant during any period of 30 consecutive days.\n\nIt is a collective redundancy where there is:\n\n5 employees made redundant out of a workforce of 21 to 49 employees\n\n10 employees made redundant out of a workforce of 50 to 99 employees\n\n10% of employees made redundant out of a workforce of 100 to 299 employees\n\n30 employees made redundant out of a workforce of 300 employees\n\nRules on collective redundancies\n\nYour employer must follow certain rules if there is a collective redundancy situation.\n\nRequirement to consult\n\nYour employer must enter into consultations with a view to agreement with your representative. These consultations must take place as soon as possible and at least 30 days before the notice of redundancy is given. The aim of the consultation is to consider whether there are any alternatives to the redundancies.\n\nThese rules are set out in the Protection of Employment Acts 1977-2024 .\n\nIf your employer makes you redundant before the 30-day notice period ends, you have the right to seek redress from the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC).\n\nThe Employees (Provision of Information and Consultation) Act 2006 also requires employers to consult with employees on substantial changes in the workplace, including proposals for collective redundancies. The Act applies to employers of 50 people or more.\n\nInformation your employer must provide\n\nYour employer must provide the following information in writing to your representatives:\n\nThe reasons for the redundancy\n\nThe number and descriptions of the employees affected\n\nThe number and descriptions of employees normally employed\n\nThe period in which the redundancies will happen\n\nThe criteria for selection of employees for redundancy\n\nThe method of calculating any redundancy payment\n\nYour employer must also inform the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment in writing of the proposed redundancies at least 30 days before the occurrence of the first redundancy . SI 324/2024 sets out the information your employer must provide to the Minister.\n\nIf your employer is insolvent\n\nIf your employer\u2019s business becomes insolvent, a liquidator, provisional liquidator, receiver or any other person, may be appointed by the courts to manage the business.\n\nThey are called the \u2018responsible person\u2019, and they take the place of your employer in the consultations.\n\nThe rules on collective redundancies which apply to your employer, also apply to the responsible person.\n\nResponsible persons can continue consultations started by your employer. They don\u2019t have to restart the 30-days\u2019 notice after their appointment.\n\nThese rules are set out in the Employment (Collective Redundancies and Miscellaneous Provisions) and Companies (Amendment) Act 2024 .Document 3:::\nBoth a lay-off or short-time must be temporary situations and your employer must give you notice of this before they start. The law on lay-off and short- time does not set out any minimum period of notice you must get.\n\nEmployer must be fair and cannot discriminate when selecting employees\n\nWhen selecting employees for lay-off or short-time working, employers should apply the same criteria for selection as for redundancy. The criteria should be reasonable and applied fairly.\n\nFor example, the custom and practice in the workplace may be last in, first out, or the contract of employment may set out criteria for selection.\n\nUnder employment equality law , the selection must not discriminate against employees on any of the following 9 grounds:\n\nGender\n\nCivil status\n\nFamily status\n\nAge\n\nDisability\n\nReligious belief\n\nRace\n\nSexual orientation or\n\nMembership of the Traveller community\n\nYou still receive public holiday benefit during lay-off or short-time\n\nDuring lay-off or short-time working, you still are employed by your employer and your contract of employment remains valid. This means that you are entitled to benefit for any public holidays that occur during the first 13 weeks of lay-off.\n\nPart-time employee must have worked at least 40 hours in the 5 weeks before the public holiday to receive this benefit.\n\nYou do not build up annual leave during lay-off, but you are entitled to take annual leave that you built up before being laid off.\n\nLay-off and reckonable service\n\nTo qualify for statutory redundancy, you must have 104 weeks of continuous employment with your employer. A period of lay-off will not break your continuous employment.\n\nHow much redundancy pay you qualify for is based on your pay and the length of your reckonable service . A lay-off that happens in the 3 year period before your employment ends does not count towards your reckonable service.\n\nI was laid off due to COVID-19\n\nPlease see the table below to see what counts towards reckonable service.\n\nWhat period IS counted towards reckonable service The period you received \u2026 What period IS NOT counted towards reckonable service The period you received \u2026 Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme (TWSS) COVID-19 Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP) Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) A jobseeker\u2019s payment Another social welfare payment\n\nHow to claim redundancy from your employer\n\nYou can claim redundancy if you are on a lay-off or short-time working or a combination of both for either:\n\nAt least 4 consecutive weeks\n\n6 weeks within the last 13 weeks\n\nYou may be entitled to a redundancy payment provided that you qualify for redundancy.\n\nWhen you claim for redundancy in a lay-off situation, you are stating that you believe that your employer cannot offer you work. And you want to be released from your contract, wish to receive your redundancy payment and want to look for new work.\n\nA lay-off does not involve the termination of your contract of employment, whereas a redundancy does.\n\nStep 1: Give your employer your written notice\n\nYou must give your written notice of your intention to claim redundancy payment in respect of the lay off-off or short- time. The best way to do this is by using Part B of form RP9 (pdf) .\n\nYou do not have to give notice as soon as you have been laid off or kept on short-time. You can chose to wait longer. If the short-time or lay-off stops and you decide to claim redundancy payment, you must give notice within 4 weeks after the lay-off or short-time working ends. Once this deadline passes, you are no longer entitled to claim a payment in respect of the period of lay- off or short-time.Document 4:::\n746.737\n\nWorksheet on calculating your redundancy payment\n\nYour redundancy lump sum is calculated according a certain formula based on your years of service in an employment.

ONLY provide the answer to Example 3. Follow the same structure and level of detail as Example 1 and Example 2 - short, factual, and readable. Do not list more than necessary. Stop after answering Example 3.\n\n\nExtracted documents:\nDocument 0:::\nPart-time employees\n\nGenerally, annual leave for part-time workers is calculated using Method 3 above. This means you can get 8% of your hours worked.\n\nIf you work full time for some months and part-time for the rest of the year, you should calculate the leave for the full-time and the part-time periods of work separately.\n\nAgency employees\n\nIf you are an agency worker, the party who pays your wages (employment agency or client company) is the employer for the purposes of the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997 , and is responsible for providing your annual leave entitlement.\n\nCan my employer force me to take annual leave?\n\nUsually, employees can ask to take annual leave at specific times. Your employer can accept your request, or refuse your request.\n\nYour employer decides when annual leave may be taken, but this is subject to a number of conditions. Your employer must:\n\nTake into account your family responsibilities, as well as the available opportunities for rest and recreation.\n\nDiscuss your annual leave with you (or your union) at least one month before you are to take the leave.\n\nCan I \u2018carry over\u2019 annual leave to next year?\n\nAnnual leave should be taken within the leave year (see above). Depending on your employer, you can agree to take your annual leave within 6 months of the relevant leave year.\n\nAny further carrying-over (also called holding over ) of annual leave would need to be agreed between you and your employer.\n\nAnnual leave and sick leave\n\nWhat if I get sick while on annual leave?\n\nIf you are sick while you are on annual leave, you should get a medical certificate from your GP (doctor) as soon as possible to cover the days you were sick. Give the medical certificate to your employer as soon as you return to work.\n\nThis way, the sick days will not count as annual leave, and you can take your annual leave at a later date. Your employer cannot make you to take annual leave for time you were on certified sick leave.\n\nWhat happens to my annual leave when I am off sick?\n\nYour statutory entitlement (legal entitlement) to annual leave continues to build up when you are on sick leave, as long as you have a medical certificate.\n\nCarrying over your holidays\n\nIf you are on long-term sick leave and cannot take your annual leave due to illness, you can carry it over for up to 15 months after the end of the year it was earned.\n\nIf you leave your job within these 15 months, you should get payment instead of the leave you did not take due to illness.\n\nThese protections are set out in an amendment to the Workplace Relations Act 2015.\n\nAnnual leave and other leave\n\nIn general, you are treated as being in employment while you are on:\n\nMaternity leave or additional maternity leave\n\nAdoptive leave or additional adoptive leave\n\nPaternity leave\n\nParental leave\n\nParent\u2019s leave\n\nHealth and safety leave\n\nThis means you can continue to build up your entitlement to annual leave.\n\nYou are entitled to annual leave for the first 13 weeks of carer\u2019s leave.\n\nLeaving your job, layoff, and short-time working\n\nIn general, your annual leave is calculated on the basis of hours worked. This is set out in the Organisation of Working Time Act, 1997 .\n\nLeaving your job\n\nIf you are leaving a job without taking all the annual leave you are entitled to, your employer must pay you for the days you have not taken.\n\nLay off or short-time working\n\nDuring lay off or short-time working , you are still an employee of the company and your contract of employment remains valid.Document 1:::\nLeaving your job\n\nIf you are leaving a job without taking all the annual leave you are entitled to, your employer must pay you for the days you have not taken.\n\nLay off or short-time working\n\nDuring lay off or short-time working , you are still an employee of the company and your contract of employment remains valid.\n\nYou do not build up annual leave during lay off, but you are entitled to take annual leave that you built up before being laid off.\n\nMaking a complaint\n\nIf you think your holiday entitlement is wrong, try speaking informally to your employer.\n\nIf you cannot resolve the problem informally, you can complain to the Workplace Relations Commission.\n\nYou should apply using the WRC\u2019s online complaint form . You must make your complaint within 6 months of the dispute (disagreement) happening.\n\nThe time limit may be extended for a further 6 months, but only if you have a \u2018reasonable cause\u2019 which prevented you bringing your complaint within the normal time limit.\n\nRead more about how to make a complaint , including details of the WRC adjudication process.\n\nContact information\n\nFind more information about annual leave from the Workplace Relations Commission's Information and Customer Service .\n\nWorkplace Relations Commission - Information and Customer Service\n\nO'Brien Road Carlow R93 E920\n\nOpening Hours: Mon. to Fri. 9.30am to 1pm, 2pm to 5pm\n\nTel: (059) 917 8990\n\nLocall: 0818 80 80 90\n\nHomepage: https://www.workplacerelations.ie/en/\n\n_Page edited: 7 June 2022 _\n\nRelated documents\n\nOther types of leave from work\n\nThe law gives an employee a limited right to leave from work in times of family crisis (force majeure).

It allows both you and your employer to prepare for the transition.\n\nThe length of notice you must give is set down in law and is usually stated in your employment contract .\n\nThe laws governing notice periods are detailed in the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Acts 1973\u20132005 .\n\nHow much notice should I give?\n\nCheck what your contract says about giving notice and follow those rules. If you want to negotiate a different arrangement, you should discuss this with your employer.\n\nThere is no notice period in my contract\n\nStatutory minimum notice is the shortest notice period that you can give under Irish law. If your contract does not state a notice period, you must provide the legal minimum, which is one week .\n\nThe full rules on giving notice are set out in the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Acts 1973\u20132005 . The legal (or \u2018statutory\u2019) minimum notice is set out in Section 6 of the Act.\n\nI worked for less than 13 weeks\n\nYou do not have to give notice if:\n\nYou worked for your employer for less than 13 weeks, and\n\nThere is no employment contract specifying a notice period\n\nCan I leave before my notice period ends?\n\nUsually, you are required to work the notice period.\n\nSometimes, your employer may agree that you can leave your job without working until the end of your notice period. Your employer may offer you pay instead of notice for that period.\n\nPayment instead (or \u2018in lieu\u2019) of notice is covered in Section 7 of the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Act 1973.\n\nI have outstanding annual leave\n\nIf you leave your job without taking all the annual leave you are entitled to, your employer must pay you for the unused days.\n\nSome employers may offer leave instead (or \u2018in lieu\u2019) of notice. These arrangements are not covered by legislation, so you must agree this with your employer.\n\nCan I change my mind?\n\nOnce you have given notice, the only way to withdraw it is by reaching an agreement with your employer.\n\nGetting references\n\nWhen applying for a new job, you may want to ask your current or former employer for a reference . The person who gives you a reference is called a referee .\n\nThe reference can be written or spoken and usually includes information about:\n\nHow long you worked for the employer\n\nYour job responsibilities\n\nYour attendance record\n\nYour job performance\n\nYour suitability for the new job\n\nAm I entitled to a reference by law?\n\nThere is no legal requirement for your current or previous employer to give you a reference. Few employment contracts include the right to have a reference when you leave.\n\nEmployers usually provide references when asked. If they do this for some employees, they should do it for all employees without discrimination.\n\nCan an employer provide false information in my reference?Document 3:::\nYour contract may also require you to provide a medical certificate as proof of the sudden illness or injury (you can request this from the doctor).\n\nLeave for medical care\n\nYou can take 5 days unpaid leave in any 12 consecutive months if you need to take time off work to deal with serious medical care for your:\n\nChild (including an adopted child)\n\nSpouse or civil partner\n\nCohabitant\n\nParent or grandparent\n\nBrother or sister\n\nHousemate (any other person to those listed above who lives in the same house as you)\n\nYou don\u2019t need any minimum service with your employer and you don\u2019t have to give them notice to take the leave in emergency circumstances.\n\nCompassionate leave\n\nIf a close family member dies, you may be able to take compassionate leave. This depends on:\n\nYour employment contract\n\nThe custom and practice in your workplace\n\nYour employer's discretion\n\nYou should check with your employer about what you are entitled to.\n\nJury service\n\nIf you are called for jury service , generally you must attend.\n\nYou should get paid as usual when called for jury service.\n\nIt should not affect any other employment rights. For example, any time you spend on jury service does not affect your annual leave.\n\nCareer break or study leave\n\nYou don\u2019t have an automatic right to take unpaid leave for a career break or study leave. Check your contract, as some employers allow this.\n\nIf your contract does not cover career breaks or study leave, you may be able to negotiate it with your employer.\n\nYour employer should consider any request for a career break or study leave on an individual, case-by-case basis.\n\nGet more information about taking unpaid leave from the Workplace Relations Commission\u2019s Information and Customer Service .\n\nHow to make a complaint\n\nIf you and your employer disagree about leave (for example, there is a dispute about your entitlement to force majeure leave), you can make a formal complaint to the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC).\n\nYou must use the online complaint form . All complaints must be made within 6 months of the dispute happening.\n\nThe time limit may be extended for a further 6 months if you can show there was a \u2018reasonable cause\u2019 for the delay.\n\nRead more about how to make a complaint , including details of the WRC adjudication process.\n\nMore information\n\nGet more information on the types of leave from work from the Workplace Relations Commission's Information and Customer Service .\n\nWorkplace Relations Commission - Information and Customer Service\n\nO'Brien Road Carlow R93 E920\n\nOpening Hours: Mon. to Fri. 9.30am to 1pm, 2pm to 5pm\n\nTel: (059) 917 8990\n\nLocall: 0818 80 80 90\n\nHomepage: https://www.workplacerelations.ie/en/\n\n_Page edited: 19 March 2024 _\n\nRelated documents\n\nWorksheet: One-Parent Family Payment and income from work\n\nThis worksheet shows the effect of income from work on your One-Parent Family Payment.\n\n1714.6835\n\nCase study: force majeure leave\n\nExample of 2 different requests for force majeure leave, one of which was granted.

You can view your pay details through the \u2018Manage your tax\u2019 link in Revenue\u2019s myAccount .\n\nHow much notice should I get?\n\nYou may be entitled to notice if you are being let go from your job. This means that you are given notice that your job will end, and a date when this will come into effect. The length of notice you are entitled to, will depend on your contract of employment. There is also a minimum entitlement set out in the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Acts 1973\u20132005 .\n\nTo be entitled to the legal (or 'statutory') minimum, you must have been working for your employer continuously for at least 13 weeks.\n\nMinimum period of notice\n\nThe amount of notice you are entitled to by law depends on how long you have been working for your employer.\n\nDuration of employment Minimum notice 13 weeks to 2 years 1 week 2 years to 5 years 2 weeks 5 years to 10 years 4 weeks 10 years to 15 years 6 weeks 15 years or more 8 weeks\n\nFor example, if you have worked for your employer for 5 years and 3 months you get 4 weeks' notice.\n\nWhile the notice entitlements under your contract of employment can be more than the minimum periods above, your contract cannot have a notice period less than the above.\n\nThis means that whatever your contract says, your employer must give you at least the statutory minimum period of notice. You cannot get less, even if your contract says this.\n\nContinuous service\n\nYour service is continuous unless you are dismissed or you leave your job.\n\nContinuity of service is not normally affected by:\n\nStrikes\n\nLay offs\n\nDismissal followed be immediate re-employment\n\nA transfer of undertaking (TUPE)\n\nCalculating continuous service\n\nWhen calculating the length of your continuous service for notice purposes, the following periods of absence from employment are counted as service :\n\nAny period up to 26 weeks between consecutive periods of employment because of lay off, illness or by agreement with your employer\n\nAny period of lock-out from your employment\n\nPeriods of absence due to service with the Reserve Defence Forces\n\nAny period of absence to take part in a strike is not counted as service .\n\nPay instead of notice\n\nYou may be required to work the notice period or you may accept pay in lieu (instead) of notice, if offered.\n\nExample 1:\n\nQ: What documents do I need to apply online for a driver's license in Ireland?\nA: You need a Public Services Card and verified MyGovID, proof of your address if your address is different to the one you provided when you got your Public Services Card, proof that you are normally resident in Ireland if you are not an EU or EEA citizen, a medical report form, dated within one month if required, and a Certificate of Professional Competence (CPC) for professional drivers.\n\nExample 2:\n\nQ: What criteria do I need to meet to qualify for unemployment benefits in Ireland?\nA: You must be under 66 years of age, or under 70 years and\u202fdeferring your State Pension (Contributory), be unemployed (you must be unemployed for at least 4 days out of 7), have had a substantial loss of employment and as a result be unemployed for at least 4 days out of 7 (this does not apply to casual workers and part-time fire fighters), be capable of work, be available for and genuinely seeking work, and have enough social insurance (PRSI) contributions.\n\nExample 3:\nQ: Can my employer force me to take annual leave?\nA:\nUsually, employees can ask to take annual leave at specific times.

Stop after answering Example 3.\n\n\nExtracted documents:\nDocument 0:::\nPart-time employees\n\nGenerally, annual leave for part-time workers is calculated using Method 3 above. This means you can get 8% of your hours worked.\n\nIf you work full time for some months and part-time for the rest of the year, you should calculate the leave for the full-time and the part-time periods of work separately.\n\nAgency employees\n\nIf you are an agency worker, the party who pays your wages (employment agency or client company) is the employer for the purposes of the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997 , and is responsible for providing your annual leave entitlement.\n\nCan my employer force me to take annual leave?\n\nUsually, employees can ask to take annual leave at specific times. Your employer can accept your request, or refuse your request.\n\nYour employer decides when annual leave may be taken, but this is subject to a number of conditions. Your employer must:\n\nTake into account your family responsibilities, as well as the available opportunities for rest and recreation.\n\nDiscuss your annual leave with you (or your union) at least one month before you are to take the leave.\n\nCan I \u2018carry over\u2019 annual leave to next year?\n\nAnnual leave should be taken within the leave year (see above).

Your employer cannot make you to take annual leave for time you were on certified sick leave.\n\nWhat happens to my annual leave when I am off sick?\n\nYour statutory entitlement (legal entitlement) to annual leave continues to build up when you are on sick leave, as long as you have a medical certificate.\n\nCarrying over your holidays\n\nIf you are on long-term sick leave and cannot take your annual leave due to illness, you can carry it over for up to 15 months after the end of the year it was earned.\n\nIf you leave your job within these 15 months, you should get payment instead of the leave you did not take due to illness.\n\nThese protections are set out in an amendment to the Workplace Relations Act 2015.\n\nAnnual leave and other leave\n\nIn general, you are treated as being in employment while you are on:\n\nMaternity leave or additional maternity leave\n\nAdoptive leave or additional adoptive leave\n\nPaternity leave\n\nParental leave\n\nParent\u2019s leave\n\nHealth and safety leave\n\nThis means you can continue to build up your entitlement to annual leave.\n\nYou are entitled to annual leave for the first 13 weeks of carer\u2019s leave.\n\nLeaving your job, layoff, and short-time working\n\nIn general, your annual leave is calculated on the basis of hours worked. This is set out in the Organisation of Working Time Act, 1997 .\n\nLeaving your job\n\nIf you are leaving a job without taking all the annual leave you are entitled to, your employer must pay you for the days you have not taken.\n\nLay off or short-time working\n\nDuring lay off or short-time working , you are still an employee of the company and your contract of employment remains valid.Document 1:::\nHow does sick leave affect illness benefit?\n\nIf you are off work sick for more than 5 days, and you have enough PRSI contributions, you can apply to the Department of Social Protection (DSP) for a payment called Illness Benefit .\n\nYour Illness Benefit starts from day 6.\n\nIf you are sick again\n\nIf you have already used your 5 days of statutory sick leave in 2024 and you are sick again later in the same year, you can get Illness Benefit from day 4 of your illness (that is after the normal 3 waiting days).\n\nExamples\n\nYou can see examples of how sick leave affects illness benefit on gov.ie.\n\nYou can also see examples if you are on an employer sick pay scheme that is more favourable than statutory sick leave.\n\nSick leave within your first 13 weeks of employment\n\nIf you are sick within the first 13 weeks of employment, you are not entitled to statutory sick pay.

You must have worked at least 40 hours over the previous 5 weeks.\n\nExceptions\n\nYou are not entitled to pay or time off for the public holiday if you are on sick leave immediately before the public holiday, and either of the following apply:\n\nYou have been off work for more than 26 weeks due to an ordinary illness or an accident\n\nYou have been off work for more than 52 weeks due to an occupational accident\n\nWhat happens to my annual leave when I am off sick?\n\nIf you are sick during your annual leave and get a medical certificate for those days, they will not be counted as annual leave days.

You should continue on Illness Benefit in this scenario.\n\nIf you are on statutory sick leave at the end of a calendar year, you should move onto illness benefit if you remain unfit to work. However, if you return to work at any time in the following calendar year, you will have full access to your statutory sick leave entitlement for that year.\n\nProtection of your employment rights\n\nYour employment rights are protected during sick leave.

This also applies to people working from home .\n\nThis is outlined in the code of practice on the right to disconnect . It gives guidance on your right to disengage from work outside normal working hours.\n\nWhile failure to follow the code is not an offence, it can be used as evidence in a case taken to the Labour Court or Workplace Relations Commission (WRC) under employment legislation.\n\nLeave from work\n\nAnnual leave\n\nMost employees are entitled to 4 weeks\u2019 paid annual leave per leave year. However, your contract of employment may give you more annual leave than the statutory entitlement. There are 3 ways to calculate your annual leave .\n\nPublic holidays\n\nAll full-time employees are entitled to 10 public holidays each year.\n\nTo qualify for pay on a public holiday or a paid day off, part-time employees must have worked at least 40 hours in total during the 5 weeks ending on the day before the public holiday.\n\nIf you must work on a public holiday, you are entitled to one of the following (decided by your employer):\n\nA paid day off on the public holiday\n\nA paid day off within a month of the public holiday\n\nAn extra day\u2019s annual leave\n\nAn extra day\u2019s pay\n\nIf you work part-time and the public holiday falls on a day that you do not normally work, you are entitled to one-fifth of your normal weekly wage for the day.\n\nSick leave\n\nYou have a right to 5 days paid sick leave a year. This is called statutory sick pay (that means the legal minimum).\n\nSick pay is paid by your employer at 70% of your normal pay up to a maximum of \u20ac110 a day.\n\nTo qualify for statutory sick pay you must:\n\nBe an employee\n\nHave worked for your employer for at least 13 continuous weeks before you are sick\n\nBe certified by a GP as unable to work\n\nProtective leave\n\nYou are entitled to certain statutory protective leave.\n\nThis includes:\n\nMaternity leave : You are entitled to take 26 weeks maternity leave from work while you are having a baby. Your contract of employment will state if your employer pays you when you are on maternity leave (this is not a requirement). You may be entitled to Maternity Benefit. You are also entitled to take up to 16 weeks of additional unpaid maternity leave, which is not covered by Maternity Benefit .\n\nPaternity leave : New parents (usually the father or the partner of the mother, or in the case of adoption, the parent who is not taking adoptive leave) are entitled to 2 weeks\u2019 paternity leave from employment or self-employment following the birth or adoption of a child. Your contract of employment will state if your employer pays you when you are on paternity leave (this is not a requirement). You may be eligible for Paternity Benefit .\n\nParental leave : Each parent is entitled to 26 weeks\u2019 unpaid parental leave. You must take parental leave before the child is 12 years of age, or 16 years of age if the child has a disability. In general, you must have been working for your employer for at least 12 months to be entitled to parental leave.Document 4:::\nWhat if I have twins or triplets?\n\nParents of twins or triplets can take more than 26 weeks of parental leave in a year.\n\nWhat if I work part-time?\n\nIf you work part-time, your entitlement to parental leave is reduced on a \u2018pro-rata basis\u2019.\n\nThis means that, if you work 50% of a normal working week, you can take 13 full working weeks\u2019 worth of parental leave.\n\nIn some cases, you and your employer will need to calculate what your normal working week is, based on the number of hours worked in the previous 26 weeks.\n\nDo I have to take all my parental leave at the same time?\n\nYou are entitled to 26 weeks parental leave for each eligible child. You can take this leave as either:\n\nOne continuous period of leave\n\n2 separate blocks of at least 6 weeks each (there must be a gap of at least 10 weeks between the 2 periods of parental leave per child).\n\nYou can break your parental leave into working days or hours (or a combination of both) if your employer agrees to this. For example, you can ask to take one day of parental leave a week until the entire 26-week allowance is used up.\n\nCan I share my unpaid parental leave with my partner?\n\nBoth parents have an equal, separate entitlement to parental leave. This means you are both entitled to 26 weeks leave.\n\nIf you both work for the same employer and your employer agrees, you can transfer 14 weeks of your parental leave entitlement to the other parent.\n\nWhat happens if I change jobs before taking all my leave?\n\nIf you change job and have used part of your parental leave allowance, you can use the remainder of your allowance after one year's employment with your new employer (once your child is still under 12).\n\nProtection of your employment rights\n\nYour employment rights are protected during parental leave. In general, you are treated as being in employments while you are on parental leave.\n\nThe only exception to this is your right to pay or superannuation (pension contributions) from your employer while you are on parental leave.\n\nPublic holidays and annual leave\n\nYou can continue to build up annual leave while on parental leave. If your holidays fall during parental leave, they may be taken at a later time.\n\nYou are entitled to any public holidays that occur while you are on parental leave. Your public holiday entitlement can be added to the end of your parental leave.\n\nWhat happens if I become sick while on parental leave?\n\nIf you get sick while on parental leave and are unable to care for your child, the leave can be suspended for the duration of the illness.\n\nYou must give written notice and evidence of your illness to your employer as soon as is reasonably practicable.\n\nThe parental leave resumes after the illness. During the illness, you are treated as an employee who is sick .\n\nWhat happens to my social insurance contributions?\n\nYou can get credited PRSI contributions while you are taking parental leave. Credited PRSI contributions can protect your social insurance record and your entitlement to benefits in the future.\n\nYour employer must write to the Client Eligibility Services section of Department of Social Protection (DSP), setting out the weeks you have not worked, so that you can get credited PRSI contributions for this time.\n\nCan my employer refuse my request for parental leave?\n\nYour employer can only refuse parental leave if you are not entitled to take it.\n\nCan my employer postpone my parental leave?\n\nExample 1:\n\nQ: What documents do I need to apply online for a driver's license in Ireland?\nA: You need a Public Services Card and verified MyGovID, proof of your address if your address is different to the one you provided when you got your Public Services Card, proof that you are normally resident in Ireland if you are not an EU or EEA citizen, a medical report form, dated within one month if required, and a Certificate of Professional Competence (CPC) for professional drivers.\n\nExample 2:\n\nQ: What criteria do I need to meet to qualify for unemployment benefits in Ireland?\nA: You must be under 66 years of age, or under 70 years and\u202fdeferring your State Pension (Contributory), be unemployed (you must be unemployed for at least 4 days out of 7), have had a substantial loss of employment and as a result be unemployed for at least 4 days out of 7 (this does not apply to casual workers and part-time fire fighters), be capable of work, be available for and genuinely seeking work, and have enough social insurance (PRSI) contributions.\n\nExample 3:\nQ: What if I get sick while on annual leave?\nA:\nIf you are sick while you are on annual leave, you should get a medical certificate from your GP (doctor) as soon as possible to cover the days you were sick. Give the medical certificate to your employer as soon as you return to work.\n\nThis way, the sick days will not count as annual leave, and you can take your annual leave at a later date.

Generally, security of tenure applies automatically when you have been renting for 6 months and haven\u2019t received a valid notice of termination from your landlord in that time. When you have security of tenure, your landlord can only terminate your tenancy for a limited number of reasons, see our page If your landlord wants you to leave .\n\nThe amount of time you are entitled to stay in rented accommodation after the first 6 months depends on when your tenancy began. This is because rules about security of tenure have changed.\n\nIf your tenancy was created after 10 June 2022 , you will have a tenancy of unlimited duration. This means if you have rented somewhere for 6 months, you have the right to stay in that accommodation indefinitely (no end date), unless the landlord wants to terminate your tenancy for one of the allowed reasons.\n\nIf your tenancy was created before 10 June 2022 , you have the right to stay in the rented accommodation for up to 6 years after you have rented for 6 months. After these 6 years, the tenancy ends and a new tenancy can begin. Your landlord can terminate the tenancy at the end of the six-year period without giving a reason, as allowed under the old rules. But, if the landlord does not end your tenancy at this stage, it automatically becomes a tenancy of unlimited duration (no end date).\n\nBy June 2028, all tenancies will be tenancies of unlimited duration. This is because all existing 6-year cycle tenancies will have ended by then.\n\nSecurity of tenure and the law\n\nInitially tenants had the right to stay in rented accommodation for up to 4 years, following an initial 6-month period. This right was introduced under the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 and meant that your tenancy became a Part 4 tenancy. This could be followed by a further Part 4 tenancy after the first 4 years, see Part 4 and further Part 4 tenancies below. The Planning and Development (Housing) and Residential Tenancies Act 2016 extended a Part 4 tenancy (security of tenure) from 4 years to 6 years for tenancies created from 24 December 2016.\n\nThen the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) (No. 2) Act 2021 brought in tenancies of unlimited duration for tenancies created from 11 June 2022.\n\nWhat tenancies does the residential tenancies legislation cover?\n\nResidential tenancies legislation covers private residential tenancies. A private residential tenancy is a tenancy that is agreed privately between a landlord and a tenant. It includes tenancies under the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) and the Rental Accommodation Scheme (RAS) . If you are getting Rent Supplement , you are probably renting from a private landlord, so you would be covered by the residential tenancies legislation.Document 1:::\nBy June 2028, all tenancies will be tenancies of unlimited duration and the above exception will no longer apply. This is because all existing 6-year cycle tenancies will have ended by then.\n\nExceptions to Part 4 rights\n\nIf you are renting a self-contained flat or apartment in your landlord\u2019s home, which was originally part of the main house, your landlord can choose to opt out of the Part 4 provisions. If your landlord wants to take this option, you must get notice of this in writing, before the start of the tenancy.\n\nTenants of certain properties let by housing associations do not get Part 4 rights. For example, people living in transitional housing. Transitional housing is temporary supported accommodation that helps people move from homelessness to independent living in permanent accommodation.\n\nPart 4 rights do not apply to tenants in student-specific accommodation.\n\nAdditional rules when ending a tenancy for a valid reason\n\nAdditional rules apply if your landlord ends your tenancy for certain valid reasons.\n\nRequirement to offer property back to the tenant\n\nIf your landlord ends your tenancy for one of the below reasons and the property then becomes available to rent again, the landlord must offer the property back to you within 12 months of the expiry of your notice period.\n\nThey must do this if they ended your tenancy because they:\n\nPlanned to sell the property within 9 months\n\nNeeded the property for their own use or for an immediate family member\n\nPlanned to change the use of the property\n\nPlanned to refurbish the property substantially\n\nYour landlord must make every reasonable effort to get your contact details, so they can offer the property back to you. This includes contacting the RTB to ask for them. The RTB may have your contact details to give to the landlord or they may contact you to get them. The RTB will only pass your details to the landlord if you have given your consent to do this.\n\nWhen your landlord contacts you to offer to re-let the property to you, you have 7 days to accept or reject this offer.\n\nThe RTB website has a step-by-step guide to this procedure .\n\nRestriction on terminating tenancies when selling multiple properties\n\nA landlord cannot terminate a tenancy of more than 6 months if they intend to sell 10 or more dwellings in a development within a 6-month period, unless:\n\nThey can show that the market value with a sitting tenant is over 20% below the market value with vacant possession, and\n\nPreventing them from terminating the tenancy would be unduly onerous on them or would cause them undue hardship\n\nThis provision is often called the \u2018Tyrrelstown\u2019 amendment and it is provided for under Section 40 of the Planning and Development (Housing) and Residential Tenancies Act 2016 .\n\nNotice of termination\n\nIf your landlord wants you to leave, they must serve you with a valid written notice of termination. The notice can be posted to you, be given to you in person or be left for you at your address. Emails and text messages do not qualify as valid notices of termination. If it appears that you are not living in the property, the landlord can affix the notice to the outside of the property.\n\nYour landlord must also send a copy of the notice of termination to the Residential Tenancies Board (RTB). This must be done at the same time as it is sent to you. It can be emailed to NoticeofTermination@rtb.ie or posted to the RTB along with the RTB Notice of Termination Return Form (pdf) .Document 2:::\nHowever, a lease should not contain terms that contradict the legal rights of tenants and landlords. If this happens, your legal rights as a tenant or landlord will overrule the terms in the lease. For example, your landlord cannot enter the property at any time without your permission. This is the case even if your lease states that the landlord may enter the property at any time.\n\nIf you sign a lease together with other people, you each become responsible for all the rent. So, if your fellow tenants cannot pay their share of the rent, you may be legally liable for the entire amount. If you sign a lease on your own on behalf of the other tenants, you become responsible for all the rent.\n\nIf the yearly rent on the lease for residential accommodation is over \u20ac30,000, the tenant is responsible for stamp duty on the annual rent. It is your responsibility as a tenant to pay this to Revenue .\n\nRead more about leases on the website of Threshold, the national housing charity.\n\nPeriodic tenancy\n\nA periodic tenancy agreement does not specify a fixed length of time. The period of the tenancy may be weekly or monthly, depending on how often the rent is due. Periodic tenancy agreements may or may not be in writing.\n\nYour landlord can end the tenancy at any time during the first 6 months of the tenancy without having to give a reason, but, in general, you will get security of tenure after 6 months \u2013 see \u2018Part 4 tenancy\u2019 below. You must always get a valid written notice of termination and there are rules about how much notice you must be given, depending on the length of the tenancy (with some exceptions). Read more in our page If your landlord wants you to leave .\n\nAs a tenant, you can end the periodic tenancy at any time. You do not have to give a reason. Again, there are rules about notice periods and what constitutes a valid notice of termination \u2013 see \u2018Ending your tenancy\u2019 below.\n\nClaiming a Part 4 tenancy at the end of a fixed-term lease\n\nIf you have a fixed-term contract or lease and you want to remain in the property under a Part 4 tenancy, you should notify your landlord of your intention to stay in the property. You should do this between 3 months and 1 month before your fixed\u2013term tenancy or lease agreement expires.\n\nIf you do not notify your landlord, you cannot be refused coverage under Part 4, but you may have to compensate the landlord for any financial loss that they have because you did not notify them of your intention to remain in the tenancy.\n\nEnding your tenancy\n\nThe following section outlines what a tenant must do to end a tenancy. There are different rules for landlords who want to end a tenancy . The RTB also has information on their website about how a tenant can end a tenancy .\n\nFormat of termination notice\n\nAs a tenant, you can terminate your tenancy (whether fixed-term or periodic) without giving a reason, but you must give a valid notice of termination to your landlord. In order to be valid, this notice must:\n\nBe in writing\n\nBe signed by you\n\nSpecify the date that you are serving it on the landlord\n\nSpecify the termination date of the tenancy (you have the full 24 hours of this date to vacate possession)\n\nState that any issue about the validity of the notice can be referred to the RTB within 28 days of receipt of the notice\n\nYou can use the RTB's sample notice of termination .\n\nEnding a fixed-term tenancyDocument 3:::\nWhen you have a Part 4 tenancy or further Part 4 tenancy, your landlord can only terminate your tenancy in certain circumstances. Read more about when a landlord can terminate your tenancy in our page If your landlord wants you to leave .\n\nIf you have a fixed-term agreement and want to leave, you do not have to give a reason, but you must give the correct period of notice in writing \u2013 see \u2018Ending your tenancy\u2019 below.\n\nLandlords' right to end a tenancy every 6 years\n\nIf your tenancy was created before 11 June 2022, your landlord can terminate your tenancy after 6 years for any reason. This is only allowed if:\n\nThe landlord served a notice of termination before the end of the 6 years, and\n\nThe notice period expired on or after the end of the tenancy\n\nIf the tenancy is not ended and a new tenancy begins after 6 years, the new tenancy will be of unlimited duration and this rule will not be apply.\n\nTenancy agreements\n\nWhen you rent your home from a private landlord or an approved housing body, you have an agreement or contract with that person or body, known as a tenancy agreement \u2013 which may or may not be in writing. The most common types of tenancy are fixed-term tenancies and periodic tenancies \u2013 both described in more detail below. A tenancy agreement cannot contain terms that contradict the legal rights of tenants and landlords.\n\nFixed-term tenancy\n\nA fixed-term tenancy is an agreement that covers a specific amount of time. It is generally (but not always) set down in a written contract, called a lease. It may be for any period, but can range from as little as 6 months up to a year or more. It is important to note the following points about a fixed- term tenancy:\n\nYour landlord cannot end the tenancy before the end of the fixed term unless you have breached your obligations\n\nIn general, you cannot end the tenancy before the end of the term unless:\n\nThe landlord has breached their obligations\n\nYou are exercising a break clause\n\nYou have got someone to replace you\n\nYou and the landlord both agree to end it\n\nIf a private landlord refuses to consent to an assignment or sub-let of the tenancy, you can terminate the tenancy under Section 186 of the Residential Tenancies Act 2004. This does not apply to tenants of approved housing bodies (housing associations), as they cannot assign or sublet their tenancy.\n\nIn general, you get security of tenure after 6 months \u2013 see above\n\nIf you want to stay in the property after the end of the fixed term, you must notify the landlord at least a month before the term expires\n\nLeases\n\nThe lease will say how much rent you have to pay, how often you have to pay it and other conditions. Make sure that you understand the terms of the lease before you sign it. A lease is a binding contract between you and the landlord and contains important information on the terms of your tenancy. In particular, it should say what will happen if either of you breaks the terms of the agreement.\n\nHowever, a lease should not contain terms that contradict the legal rights of tenants and landlords. If this happens, your legal rights as a tenant or landlord will overrule the terms in the lease. For example, your landlord cannot enter the property at any time without your permission. This is the case even if your lease states that the landlord may enter the property at any time.Document 4:::\nResidential tenancies legislation also covers approved housing bodies tenancies and tenancies in student-specific accommodation. But, there are some differences in how the legislation is applied to these tenancies, see below. .\n\nExceptions to security of tenure rights\n\nIf you are renting a flat or apartment that was originally part of the landlord's main house, your landlord can choose to opt out of the Part 4 provisions on security of tenure. Read more in our page on Sharing accommodation with your landlord .\n\nTenants of certain properties let by housing associations do not get Part 4 rights. For example, people living in transitional housing. Transitional housing is temporary supported accommodation that helps people move from homelessness to independent living in permanent accommodation.\n\nPart 4 rights do not apply to tenants in student-specific accommodation even though other parts of residential tenancies legislation covers these tenancies.\n\nTenancies of unlimited duration\n\nYou automatically get security of tenure and can stay in your rented property indefinitely if all of the following apply:\n\nYour tenancy was created after 10 June 2022\n\nYou have been renting for at least 6 months\n\nYou haven't been served with a valid written notice of termination\n\nThis is known as a tenancy of unlimited duration.\n\nIf your tenancy was created before 11 June 2022, the previous security of tenure rules apply until the current 6-year cycle of the tenancy ends. If the landlord does not terminate the tenancy under the old rules, your tenancy will automatically become a tenancy of unlimited duration after 6 years. See Part 4 and further Part 4 tenancies below for details about the old rules.\n\nIf the old rules apply to your tenancy, you can switch to a tenancy of unlimited duration if your landlord agrees.\n\nThe Residential Tenancies Board\u2019s website has information and an FAQ about tenancies of unlimited duration .\n\nPart 4 and further Part 4 tenancies\n\nPart 4 tenancy\n\nIf your tenancy was created before 11 June 2022 and you have been renting for at least 6 months and haven't been served with a valid written notice of termination, you automatically get security of tenure and can stay in the property for 6 years. This is known as a Part 4 tenancy.\n\nA Part 4 tenancy refers to Part 4 of the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 , which deals with security of tenure. If you have a periodic tenancy (a tenancy without a fixed length of time), you do not have to claim the Part 4 tenancy in writing, but you do need to claim it if you have a fixed-term lease \u2013 see below.\n\nUnder the old rules, security of tenure continued in 6-year cycles. But, from 11 June 2022, when your tenancy ends after 6 years, it will automatically become a tenancy of unlimited duration, if the landlord does not terminate it under the old rules.\n\nFurther Part 4 tenancy\n\nFor tenancies created before 11 June 2022, a new tenancy begins after the first 6-year cycle of your Part 4 tenancy. This new tenancy will now be a tenancy of unlimited duration, unless the landlord terminates it, see \u2018Landlords' right to end a tenancy every 6 years\u2019 below. However, under the old rules, you would have a further Part 4 tenancy.\n\nWhen you have a Part 4 tenancy or further Part 4 tenancy, your landlord can only terminate your tenancy in certain circumstances. Read more about when a landlord can terminate your tenancy in our page If your landlord wants you to leave .\n\nExample 1:\n\nQ: What documents do I need to apply online for a driver's license in Ireland?\nA: You need a Public Services Card and verified MyGovID, proof of your address if your address is different to the one you provided when you got your Public Services Card, proof that you are normally resident in Ireland if you are not an EU or EEA citizen, a medical report form, dated within one month if required, and a Certificate of Professional Competence (CPC) for professional drivers.\n\nExample 2:\n\nQ: What criteria do I need to meet to qualify for unemployment benefits in Ireland?\nA: You must be under 66 years of age, or under 70 years and\u202fdeferring your State Pension (Contributory), be unemployed (you must be unemployed for at least 4 days out of 7), have had a substantial loss of employment and as a result be unemployed for at least 4 days out of 7 (this does not apply to casual workers and part-time fire fighters), be capable of work, be available for and genuinely seeking work, and have enough social insurance (PRSI) contributions.\n\nExample 3:\nQ: What is a valid reason for ending a tenancy after the first 6 months?\nA:\n\nA valid reason for ending a tenancy after the first 6 months is if the landlord wants to sell the property within 9 months, needs the property for their own use or for an immediate family member, plans to change the use of the property, plans to refurbish the property substantially, or if the tenant has breached the terms of the tenancy agreement.",

Stop after answering Example 3.\n\n\nExtracted documents:\nDocument 0:::\nSteps involved in adopting a child\n\nTo adopt a child in Ireland, you must follow certain steps, including:\n\nContact your local adoption office\n\nTo start the application process, you must contact your local adoption office , which is run by Tusla \u2013 the child and family agency . Your local adoption office will give you information about how to complete your \u2018application for assessment\u2019.\n\nYou are assessed\n\nApplicants must go through a detailed assessment, including a number of interviews and home visits. The assessment is carried out by a Tusla social worker or an accredited adoption agency.\n\nIf you are applying for adoption as a married couple or as a cohabiting couple, you will be interviewed individually and together.\n\nThe social worker will ask you about your:\n\nPrevious and current relationships\n\nMotives (reasons) for adopting\n\nExpectations of the child\n\nAbility to help a child develop their knowledge and understanding of their natural background (their birth story and where they came from)\n\nAll applicants must also have a medical examination and Garda vetting .\n\nAfter you have been assessed, the social worker prepares an \u2018assessment report\u2019 which goes before the local adoption committee. The committee will then make a recommendation.\n\nYou are granted a \u2018Declaration to Adopt\u2019\n\nThe Adoption Authority of Ireland is sent:\n\nYour application for assessment\n\nThe social worker\u2019s report\n\nThe local adoption committee\u2019s recommendations\n\nIf all documents are in place and correct, the Adoption Authority of Ireland will consider the recommendations and decide whether to grant a Declaration to Adopt (sometimes called a \u2018Declaration of Eligibility and Suitability\u2019). The declaration is like a \u2018license to adopt\u2019, and may include the age and health status of a child whom you are considered suitable to parent (based on the information in the assessment report).\n\nThe Declaration of Eligibility and Suitability is granted for a period of 2 years from the date it is issued . If your declaration is about to expire, you can apply to have it extended by a further 1 year , provided there have been no changes in your circumstances.\n\nIf your circumstances have changed (for example, you moved home or your health status has changed), you must tell the Adoption Authority of Ireland in writing . Read more about what to do if your situation has changed under the heading \u2018Declaration of Eligibility and Suitability\u2019 on the Adoption Authority\u2019s website.\n\nThe \u2018best interests of the child\u2019 are considered\n\nThe Adoption Authority of Ireland always puts the best interests of the child first. The Authority will consider:\n\nThe child\u2019s age and maturity\n\nThe physical, psychological and emotional needs of the child\n\nThe likely effect of adoption on the child\n\nThe child\u2019s views on their proposed adoption\n\nThe child\u2019s social, intellectual and educational needs\n\nThe child\u2019s upbringing and care\n\nThe child\u2019s relationship with their parent, guardian or relative as the case may be\n\nAny other circumstances affecting the child\n\nAn adoption order is made\n\nAn adoption order is a legal document, issued by the Adoption Authority of Ireland. It confirms that the child is, by law, a member of their new family. When an adoption order is issued, the child is legally regarded as the child of the adoptive parents, as if they were born to them.\n\nThe period of time between the granting of the declaration of eligibility and suitability to the making of an adoption order differs from one case to another depending on the type of adoption application being made and the particular circumstances of the applicants and the child.\n\nIn the case of a step-parent adoption where the child is in situ, it is expected that the application for the adoption order will progress during the lifespan of the declaration of eligibility and suitability.Document 1:::\nEnglish | Gaeilge\n\nYou are here: Home > Family and Relationships > Adoption, fostering and surrogacy > Intercountry adoption\n\nIntercountry adoption\n\nWhat is intercountry adoption?\n\nWho can adopt?\n\nBeing assessed for eligibility to adopt\n\nChoosing a country to adopt from\n\nThe process of intercountry adoption\n\nGetting immigration clearance for the child\n\nSteps to take once the child arrives in Ireland\n\nMore information about intercountry adoption\n\nWhat is intercountry adoption?\n\nIf you adopt a child who lives in a country outside Ireland, the process is called intercountry adoption. If you adopt a child who is resident in Ireland, it is called domestic adoption .\n\nWhen you adopt a child, they become a member of your family. Adoption creates a legal relationship between the adoptive parents and the child.\n\nAs intercountry adoption is a complex legal process, you should get legal advice from a solicitor who specialises in intercountry adoption. See 'More information about intercountry adoption' below.\n\nWho can adopt?\n\nYou must be at least 21 years of age to adopt a child under Irish law. There is no Irish legal upper age limit for adopting parents but age is a factor in determining suitability here.\n\nYou must also:\n\nHave a valid 'declaration of eligibility and suitability' (see 'Being assessed for eligibility to adopt' below)\n\nBe \u2018habitually resident in the State\u2019, which means Ireland has become your home. Living in Ireland for at least one year before the date of the making of the adoption order would generally be sufficient.\n\nYour relationship status does not necessarily impact your eligibility to adopt a child. This means you are eligible to adopt if you are:\n\nA married couple\n\nA couple living together in a civil partnership\n\nA couple cohabiting together in a relationship for at least 3 years (living together but not married or in a civil partnership)\n\nA sole applicant who is not in one of the categories listed above (only where the Adoption Authority is satisfied that, in the particular circumstances of the case, it is desirable and in the best interests of the child)\n\nYou may also be eligible to adopt if you are the mother, father or relative of the child. \u2018Relative\u2019 means a grandparent, brother, sister, uncle or aunt of the child (or the spouse of any such person), with the relationship to the child being traced through either the mother or the father.\n\nThis is set out in the Adoption (Amendment) Act 2017 (pdf) .\n\nYou can find more information on the eligibility and suitability of people wishing to adopt on the Adoption Authority website.\n\nBeing assessed for eligibility to adopt\n\nBefore you can adopt a child from another country, you must undergo an assessment of your eligibility and suitability. The assessment is carried out by a social worker from the Tusla intercountry adoption service , or an accredited body.\n\nThe social worker will then prepare an \u2018intercountry adoption assessment report\u2019 (also called a home-study report). The report goes before the local adoption committee, who will then make a recommendation.\n\nNext, the Adoption Authority will review:\n\nYour application for assessment\n\nThe social worker\u2019s report\n\nThe local adoption committee\u2019s recommendations\n\nIf all documents are in place and correct, and the recommendations are positive, the Adoption Authority will grant you a declaration of eligibility and suitability (pdf) .\n\nDeclaration of eligibility and suitability\n\nThe 'declaration of eligibility and suitability' may include a statement about the age or health condition of a child whom you are considered suited to parent (based on information provided in the assessment report).Document 2:::\nEnglish | Gaeilge\n\nYou are here: Home > Family and Relationships > Adoption, fostering and surrogacy\n\nAdoption, fostering and surrogacy\n\nDomestic adoption\n\nAn outline of the adoption process in Ireland.\n\nIntercountry adoption\n\nThe process of adopting a child from abroad, and the requirements (eligibility criteria) you must meet in order to carry out an intercountry adoption.\n\nFostering\n\nThere are currently more than 5,500 children in care in Ireland.

They will check the register against all applications for adoption.\n\nWhat if the mother cannot (or will not) consent?\n\nIf a mother or guardian cannot (or will not) consent to a proposed adoption, the adoption can only proceed by an order of the High Court.\n\nIn this case, Tusla or the adopters must apply to the Court. They must prove that the child\u2019s parents have failed in their duty to the child, and that this failure can be considered legally as an abandonment of their parental rights and duties.\n\nFor this application to be made, the case must first be heard before the Board of the Adoption Authority of Ireland. Read the rules for these hearings on the Adoption Authority of Ireland's website .\n\nCan the birth mother (or guardian) change their mind?\n\nIf the mother or guardian withdraws (takes back) their consent after the child has been placed for adoption, the adopters may apply to the High Court for an order. If the court is satisfied that it is in the best interests of the child, it will make an order giving custody of the child to the adopting parents for a specified period. The court can also authorise the Adoption Authority of Ireland to dispense with the mother's (or guardian's) consent to the making of the adoption order.\n\nIf a mother changes her mind about adoption before the adoption order is made, but the adopting parents refuse to give up the child, she can begin legal proceedings to have custody of her child returned to her.\n\nEmployment rights of adoptive parents\n\nAn adoptive parent is entitled to take adoptive leave from employment. Adoptive leave gives 24 weeks\u2019 leave off work to one parent of the adopting couple (or a parent who is adopting alone). The 24 weeks start from the date the child is placed in your care.\n\nAdoptive parents are also entitled to 9 weeks\u2019 parent\u2019s leave within 2 years of the child being placed with the family.\n\nYou may also be entitled to take parental leave , to spend time looking after your children. You can take up to 26 weeks\u2019 parental leave for each eligible child before their 12th birthday.\n\nLaws on adoption and the organisations involved\n\nThe Adoption Act 2010 merged, consolidated and updated all existing adoption laws in Ireland. This Act was revised further by the Adoption (Amendment) Act 2017. Read about these key pieces of legislation in the table below:Document 4:::\nIn the case of a step-parent adoption where the child is in situ, it is expected that the application for the adoption order will progress during the lifespan of the declaration of eligibility and suitability.\n\nWhere it is a domestic infant adoption, there is no guarantee that a couple will be matched with a child during the lifetime of the declaration. Before making an adoption order the Adoption Authority of Ireland must be satisfied that the child is eligible to be adopted.\n\nYou and the child attend the adoption hearing\n\nWhen the adoption order is finally being made, the child and adoptive parents go before the Board of the Adoption Authority of Ireland. The adoptive parents must give sworn evidence about their identity and eligibility.\n\nThe adoptive parents will have previously completed a form indicating the name the child wants on the adoption order. While this can be changed at the adoption hearing, it is preferable for this to be agreed on before the date of the hearing.\n\nRead more about the adoption hearing on the Adoption Authority of Ireland's website, including age-appropriate videos and leaflets for children .\n\nYou get an adoption certificate\n\nAt the adoption hearing, you are given information about getting a new birth certificate for the child. The new birth certificate (adoption certificate) is normally available through the General Register Office within 4 weeks .\n\nAlthough it is not an actual birth certificate, it has the same status as one, and it replaces the birth certificate for legal purposes. The adoption certificate gives the date of the adoption order and the names and addresses of the adoptive parents. It is similar in all aspects to a birth certificate.\n\nRights of the birth parents\n\nBefore a child can be adopted, the birth mother (or any other legal guardian) must give written consent using an official consent form. They must consent ( agree ) to:\n\nPlacing the child for adoption by Tusla or an approved adoption service\n\nThe making of an adoption order\n\nThe birth mother (or guardian) can only give consent after they have had counselling. This is to make sure that they are giving consent in a free and informed manner. The social worker must be satisfied that the birth mother (or guardian) understands the legal and personal implications of adoption.\n\nThe birth mother (or guardian) has a right to know the religion of the prospective adoptive parents before they give consent.\n\nThe birth father\n\nIf the birth father is not a guardian of the child (for example, if he and the mother are not married), he does not have an automatic right to give, or to withhold, consent for adoption . However, he is entitled to be consulted about the adoption of his child. He can also make an application for guardianship so that he can withhold his consent.\n\nIf you (the birth father) are concerned that your partner or former partner plans to place your child for adoption without letting you know, you can ask the Adoption Authority of Ireland to notify you. To do this, you must record your details recorded on the Birth Father Register (pdf) . You can do this before your child is born, if necessary. This register is checked against all applications for adoption.\n\nRelevant non-guardians\n\nRelevant non-guardians have a right to be consulted about an adoption. A relevant non-guardian is a person who is recognised as the parent of a child, but who is not a legal guardian. A relevant non-guardian may also be a type of guardian who does not have the right to consent to an adoption.\n\nIf you are a relevant non-guardian and you are concerned that your child may be placed for adoption without your knowledge, you can register your details with the Adoption Authority of Ireland (pdf) . They will check the register against all applications for adoption.\n\nWhat if the mother cannot (or will not) consent?\n\nExample 1:\n\nQ: What documents do I need to apply online for a driver's license in Ireland?\nA: You need a Public Services Card and verified MyGovID, proof of your address if your address is different to the one you provided when you got your Public Services Card, proof that you are normally resident in Ireland if you are not an EU or EEA citizen, a medical report form, dated within one month if required, and a Certificate of Professional Competence (CPC) for professional drivers.\n\nExample 2:\n\nQ: What criteria do I need to meet to qualify for unemployment benefits in Ireland?\nA: You must be under 66 years of age, or under 70 years and\u202fdeferring your State Pension (Contributory), be unemployed (you must be unemployed for at least 4 days out of 7), have had a substantial loss of employment and as a result be unemployed for at least 4 days out of 7 (this does not apply to casual workers and part-time fire fighters), be capable of work, be available for and genuinely seeking work, and have enough social insurance (PRSI) contributions.\n\nExample 3:\nQ: Who can adopt a child in Ireland?\nA:\n\nTo adopt a child in Ireland, you must be at least 21 years of age. You must also be 'habitually resident in the State', which means Ireland has become your home.

This means you are eligible to adopt if you are:\n\n* A married couple\n* A couple living together in a civil partnership\n* A couple cohabiting together in a relationship for at least 3 years (living together but not married or in a civil partnership)\n* A sole applicant who is not in one of the categories listed above (only where the Adoption Authority is satisfied that, in the particular circumstances of the case, it is desirable and in the best interests of the child)\n\nYou may also be eligible to adopt if you are the mother, father or relative of the child. \u2018Relative\u2019 means a grandparent, brother, sister, uncle or aunt of the child (or the spouse of any such person), with the relationship to the child being traced through either the mother or the father.\n\nThis is set out in the Adoption (Amendment) Act 2017 (pdf).",

If you commit a motoring offence , and the penalty for the offence includes penalty points, your driving licence will be endorsed with one or more penalty points.\n\nSome traffic offences have other penalties, such as fines as well as penalty points.\n\nThe penalty points system for driving offences has operated in Ireland since 2002. The law governing penalty points is the Road Traffic Act 2002 . This legislation has been amended a number of times to add offences for which penalty points can be issued.\n\nWhile penalty points are endorsed on your driving licence, the points do not physically appear on the licence. Your penalty points are recorded on your driving licence record, which is held on the National Vehicle and Driver File operated by the Department of Transport.\n\nPenalty point endorsements remain on your licence record for 3 years and must be notified to your insurance company when applying for motor insurance. Motor insurance companies have had access to the National Vehicle and Driver File since 2014.\n\nEndorsements on your licence record will often lead to an increase in your motor insurance premium.\n\nHow do penalty points work?\n\nPenalty points are recorded on your driving licence when:\n\nYou are convicted in court of a driving offence that attracts penalty points or\n\nYou pay a fixed charge notice that was issued to you for an offence that also carries penalty points\n\nIf you get 12 penalty points in any 3 year period, you are automatically disqualified from driving for 6 months.\n\nLearner permit drivers are disqualified if they have 7 penalty points.

If you pay the fixed charge fine within 56 days, you will get a further notice from the Department of Transport confirming that the penalty points will be added to your driving licence. The penalty points will be added to your licence 28 days after that.\n\nIf you do not pay the fixed charge fine within 56 days, you will get a summons to appear in the District Court. If you are convicted of a driving offence in court, the court will notify the Department of Transport of the number of penalty points attached to that conviction. The Department of Transport will then issue a notification that these penalty points will be added to your driving licence 28 days after the notification date.\n\nYou can get information on fixed charge notices and fines in our document on driving offences .\n\nHow long do penalty points stay on my licence?\n\nPenalty points remain on your licence record for 3 years. Any period where your licence is out of date or you are serving a court disqualification does not count as part of the 3 years.\n\nIf you accumulate 12 points or 7 where applicable and are disqualified from driving for 6 months, the points which led to the disqualification are removed at the end of the 6 months.Document 1:::\nEnglish | Gaeilge\n\nYou are here: Home > Travel and Recreation > Motoring > Driving offences\n\nDriving offences\n\nDriving offences\n\nAn overview of the most common driving offences in Ireland, the penalties that are in place, and information on how to appeal.\n\nDrink driving offences\n\nDrink driving is a very serious offence.

If the registered owner was not driving at the time of the offence they should fill out the form attached to the notice, giving details of the person who was actually driving. This should then be returned to the Fixed Charge Processing Office with the original notice. Do not enclose payment . The Garda\u00ed then issue a notice to the driver.\n\nDo penalty points apply to all Irish driving licences?\n\nYes. Penalty points apply to both learner permits and full Irish driving licences. Penalty points also apply to drivers with foreign driving licences driving in Ireland. If someone is driving in Ireland on a foreign licence, a record will be created for penalty points. If the driver accumulates 12 penalty points in a 3-year period, they are disqualified from driving in Ireland.\n\nHow do you find out how many penalty points you have on your driving\n\nlicence?\n\nTo find out how many penalty points are on your driving licence record, contact the National Driver Licence Service (NDLS) at 0818 700 800 or email info@ndls.ie and quote your driving licence number.\n\nPenalty points from other jurisdictions\n\nPenalty points from other countries (including EU/EEA member states and the United Kingdom) are not recognised between states. Although a European Convention on driving disqualifications was signed by the member states in June 1998, it is not currently in force. However, the UK and Ireland have a separate agreement that allows each country to recognise disqualifications (but not penalty points) due to certain offences.\n\nCan penalty points be cancelled?\n\nIf you have been issued with penalty points (or a fixed charge without penalty points), you can apply to the Garda\u00ed for the points to be cancelled. You will have to show that there are good procedural or exceptional grounds for cancellation.\n\nProcedural grounds - examples of this include:\n\nA technical problem meant that wrong information was recorded (for example, the wrong speed limit was detected)\n\nYou are exempt from the offence, for example, you have an exemption from wearing a seatbelt. See our document on seatbelts )\n\nYou have been penalised for not having tax or insurance, but you can show that you had motor tax or insurance at the time of the alleged offence\n\nThe car had been stolen and you have been sent a fixed charge notice and/or penalty points for offences committed after the theft of the vehicle\n\nYou no longer owned the vehicle\n\nExceptional grounds \u2013 examples of this include\n\nYou broke the speed limit because you were bringing someone to the hospital\n\nYou broke the speed limit because you were responding to an emergency in your home (for example, a fire or gas leak)\n\nYou can get the Fixed Charge Notice Cancellation Request Form and guidance notes on filling out the form on garda.ie.\n\nMore information\n\nYou can get more information on penalty points from the Road Safety Authority .\n\nRoad Safety Authority (RSA)\n\nMoy Business Park Primrose Hill Ballina Co Mayo Ireland\n\nHomepage: http://www.rsa.ie\n\nAlternatively you can contact the NDLS (National Driver Licence Service).\n\nNational Driver Licence Service\n\nRoad Safety Authority Po Box 858 Southside Delivery Office Cork Ireland\n\nOpening Hours: Lines open Monday - Friday 9am - 5pm (excluding Public Holidays) and Saturdays 9am \u2013 1pm.\n\nTel: 0818 700 800\n\nHomepage: https://www.ndls.ie/\n\nEmail: info@ndls.ieDocument 3:::\nIf you accumulate 12 points or 7 where applicable and are disqualified from driving for 6 months, the points which led to the disqualification are removed at the end of the 6 months.\n\nBut if you had more offences that had not been endorsed on your licence record by the time you started your 6 month suspension, these extra points would be added to your licence record and would remain on your licence for 3 years (from the time your licence was reinstated).\n\nWhat happens to my licence if I have 12 penalty points or 7 where\n\napplicable?\n\nIf you have been notified by the Department of Transport that you have been disqualified from driving because you have reached 12 penalty points or more, you must surrender your driving licence to the National Driver Licence Service for the period of 6 months.\n\nWhat motoring offences result in penalty points?\n\nThe Road Traffic Act 2002, (as amended) legislates for motoring offences that incur penalty points. The Road Safety Authority maintains an up-to-date list of penalty point motoring offences.\n\nExamples of how penalty points and fines are awarded.\n\nSpeeding offences : A fixed charge fine of \u20ac160, together with 3 penalty points. If you have been caught speeding on a police traffic camera, you will get a notice of your fine and penalty points for the offence by post. You have 28 days in which to pay your fine from the date the notice is issued to you. If you do not pay your fine, the fine then increases to \u20ac240, which you must pay within 28 days. If after this time (56 days) you still have not paid your fine, the offence is referred to the courts. If you are convicted in court of speeding offences and non-payment of fines, you will automatically receive 5 penalty points and a fine up to a maximum of \u20ac1,000.\n\nSeatbelt offences : If you drive without a seatbelt or allow children under 17 years to travel in your car without a seatbelt, you will incur a fixed charge fine of \u20ac120. You must pay this fine within 28 days or face an increased fine of \u20ac180 payable within 56 days of the offence. 3 penalty points will be added to your licence if you pay the fine on time. If you are convicted in court for non-wearing of a seatbelt, 5 penalty points will be added to your licence and you will be liable to a \u20ac2,000 fine for a first offence. Read more about seatbelts and the law in Ireland .\n\nMotor insurance offences : If you drive without insurance, you will get 5 penalty points and will have to appear in court. The court can issue a fine of up to \u20ac5,000 and can send you to prison for up to 6 months. The court can disqualify you from driving instead of issuing penalty points.\n\nCareless driving : If you drive \u2018a vehicle in a public place without due care and attention' you can get up to 5 penalty points on your licence and a fine of up to \u20ac5,000. If careless driving causes death or serious bodily harm, you are liable on conviction on indictment to imprisonment for a term of up to 2 years or to a fine of up to \u20ac10,000 or to both.\n\nOther penalty point questions\n\nWhat happens if someone else was driving my vehicle?Document 4:::\nFurther information\n\nGarda S\u00edoch\u00e1na\n\nPhoenix Park Dublin 8 D08 HN3X Ireland\n\nTel: 01 6660000; Garda Confidential: 1800 666 111\n\nHomepage: https://www.garda.ie/en/\n\nCourts Service\n\n15-24 Phoenix Street North Smithfield Dublin 7 D07 F95Y Ireland\n\nTel: +353 (0)1 888 6000\n\nHomepage: https://courts.ie/\n\nHomepage: https://www.courts.ie/content/find-us\n\n_Page edited: 10 June 2024 _\n\nRelated documents\n\nDriving offences\n\nAn overview of the most common driving offences in Ireland, the penalties that are in place, and information on how to appeal.\n\n2125.0044\n\nPenalty points for driving offences\n\nHow does the penalty points system work?

The Department of Social Protection can access this information directly.\n\nYou can get more information about getting a Birth, Marriage or Death certificate .\n\nWhere to apply\n\nTo apply for a social welfare payment you should either:\n\nApply online at MyWelfare.ie (only certain payments)\n\nSend a paper application form to the address printed on the form\n\nYou can get information about applying for social welfare payments through MyWelfare.ie . You can also call 0818 405 060.\n\nFurther information\n\nHow social welfare decisions are made\n\nDeciding Officers are employed by the Department of Social Protection to accept or reject claims made in Ireland for social welfare payments. Deciding officers are given the power to make these decisions through the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005 as amended and other social welfare legislation.\n\nBefore making a claim or applying for a social welfare payment you must complete the application form. The application form will ask for various details, such as your name, address, PPS number, income etc. These details will help the Department of Social Protection to process your application and if your claim is successful, to arrange your payment.\n\nAs part of the application process, you must also provide supporting documentation to prove that the information you have given on the application form is correct. For example, a payslip to show your employment income.\n\nTo qualify for a social welfare payment, you must meet all the qualifying criteria for that payment. Different social welfare payments have different qualifying criteria. It is your responsibility to prove to the Department that you qualify for the payment you have applied for.\n\nIf you are applying for a payment due to an illness or disability your doctor must fill in part of the application from. If you are in work, your employer may have to fill in a part of the form.\n\nWhat happens when I send my application?\n\nWhen you send your application form to the Department of Social Protection, it will be assessed to make sure that it is correctly completed and that you have sent all the required documents.\n\nAt this point, the Department may request more information from you or ask you to attend a medical examination to find out if you qualify for the payment you applied for. For example, if you apply for Disability Allowance you may be asked to attend for a medical examination. If this is the case, the doctor's report stating whether you meet the medical criteria is sent to the person at the Department of Social Protection who is responsible for making a decision on your claim.\n\nWhat does a Deciding Officer do?\n\nWhen the Department has all the information it needs, a Deciding Officer will examine your claim and will either accept or reject your claim for the social welfare payment you applied for. The Deciding Officer must apply the law as set out in Social Welfare Acts, Statutory Instruments, and relevant Department guidelines, circulars and other regulations when making a decision on your claim. If your claim is approved, the Deciding Officer will determine the rate of your payment.\n\nA Deciding Officer must record their decision on your claim in writing.

You can also make a submission or observation on the application for \u20ac20. Generally, the submission or observation must be made within 5 weeks of when the local authority received the planning application.\n\nWhere can I find planning applications?\n\nPeople who are applying for planning permission must put up a site notice and advertise in a local newspaper that circulates in the area.\n\nLocal authorities must prepare weekly lists of planning applications and make them available for inspection in their offices and public libraries for at least 8 weeks.\n\nYou can also view planning applications on your local authority's website .\n\nYou can see all the documents submitted with a planning application. These are kept at the offices of your local authority.\n\nHow can I comment on a planning application?\n\nYou must make comments about planning applications in writing to the local authority where the application was made. You may be able to do this on your local authority's website.\n\nIf possible, you should quote the planning application's reference number. You must also give your:\n\nName\n\nAddress\n\nPhone number\n\nEmail address (if you have one)\n\nWhat happens when your comments are received?\n\nYour submission or observation must be acknowledged by the local authority.\n\nThe local authority cannot make a decision on an application until they have had it for 5 weeks. This is so people have time to view and comment on the application.\n\nWhen the local authority decides on the planning application, you must be informed of their decision within 3 days of them making it.\n\nIf your submission is received after the deadline, it will be returned to you along with your fee. You will also be contacted by your local authority to tell you that your submission can't be considered. The deadline for commenting on a planning application is 5 weeks from when the local authority received the planning application.\n\nThere are different rules if you want to support or object to a planning application or planning case that is with An Bord Plean\u00e1la .\n\nWhat can I comment on?\n\nYour comments must be based on planning considerations, not on personal likes, dislikes or grievances. Planning considerations include:\n\nNational and regional guidelines and ministerial directives\n\nPolicies and objectives of the development plan\n\nPolicies and objectives of any local plan\n\nLocal considerations such as site development density, parking provision, traffic hazards, overlooking, effects on residential amenity\n\nPublic health\n\nEnvironmental, amenity and shopping impacts\n\nOther material planning matters\n\nAny comments or observations you make on a planning application are public.\n\nIf you make allegations against a person or organisation in your comments, this could be seen as defamatory and you could be sued.\n\nWhat can I do if I am not happy with the decision?\n\nIf you made a submission or observation that has been acknowledged by the local authority, you have the right to appeal its planning decision to An Bord Plean\u00e1la .\n\nYou also have the right to be informed of any other appeals that have been lodged to An Bord Plean\u00e1la and to receive a copy of the appeal.\n\nAn Bord Plean\u00e1la has easy-to-read guides with information on making a planning appeal (pdf) and making an observation on a planning appeal (pdf).Document 1:::\nYou may get a copy of any EIAR used in a planning application from the local authority or An Bord Plean\u00e1la . You may comment on an EIAR in the same way as any other aspect of a planning application.\n\nThe licensing system\n\nIf the planning application for a development requires an EIAR to be attached, then the EIAR must also be included in the application for a licence from the EPA. The local authority must notify the EPA of any planning application involving a development which needs an Integrated Pollution Control (IPC) licence. The EPA then has 5 weeks to comment on the application.\n\nIf the local authority decides to give planning permission for such a development, it cannot impose conditions relating to the control of emissions. This is for the EPA. It can, however, refuse permission on environmental grounds (even if the EPA is prepared to grant a licence).\n\nWhat is a Strategic Environmental Assessment?\n\nPublic plans and programmes that are likely to have significant effects on the environment must have a Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA). The SEA ensures that these plans and programmes are assessed for their environmental effect before they are adopted. The SEA Directive applies to a number of sectors including:\n\nAgriculture\n\nForestry\n\nFisheries\n\nEnergy\n\nIndustry\n\nTransport\n\nWaste management\n\nWater management\n\nTelecommunications\n\nTourism\n\nLand use planning\n\nThe SEA Directive (2001/42/EC) is implemented in Ireland by the European Communities (Environmental Assessment of Certain Plans and Programmes) Regulations 2004 (SI 435/2004) and the Planning and Development (Strategic Environmental Assessment) Regulations 2004 (SI 436/ 2004) as amended by SI 200/2011 and SI 201/2011.\n\nThis legislation implements the following aspects of the SEA Directive:\n\nThe review, preparation and variation of a development plan\n\nThe preparation or amendment of a local area plan\n\nThe review or making of regional planning guidelines\n\nThe making of a planning scheme in respect of part or all of a Strategic Development Zone (SDZ).\n\nThe Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) must be consulted on all plans and programmes that need an SEA, and at each stage of the SEA process. The EPA has published SEA resource and guidance documents , as well as detailed information about the SEA process .\n\n_Page edited: 26 November 2020 _\n\nRelated documents\n\nEnvironmental protection of nature and biodiversity\n\nA range of Irish and EU legislation aims to ensure biodiversity by conserving natural habitats and wild fauna and flora.\n\n1881.1504\n\nFood safety and environmental health services\n\nA brief description of the different agencies involved in food safety and environmental health in Ireland and Europe.\n\n1763.9017\n\nJudicial review in planning and environmental matters\n\nPublic decisions may be judicially reviewed by the High Court to determine whether they are illegal.

Different fees apply to different types of development. For example, the current fee for an application to build a house is \u20ac65. The fee for a house extension or the conversion of a garage for use as part of a house is \u20ac34.\n\nBefore you apply for planning permission\n\nBefore applying for planning permission you must give public notice of your proposals. You do this by:\n\nPutting a notice in a local newspaper (your local authority will have a list), and\n\nPutting up a site notice that can be clearly seen and read\n\nYou will find details of information that must be contained in the notices in the planning application form. Your planning application must be received by the local authority within 2 weeks of the notice appearing in the local newspaper and the site notice going up.\n\nNote:\n\nThe site notice must remain in place for at least 5 weeks from the date of receipt of the planning application. (Note, nine days over Christmas, from 24 December to 1 January, are not taken into account when calculating the 5-week period).\n\nHow to apply for planning permission\n\nYou apply for planning permission by filling in a planning application form and submitting it together with required documents to your local authority.\n\nContact your local authority for advice about how to apply, whether your proposals are likely to comply with the development plan, what other documents you will need, what the fee will be and any other requirements. Information, application form and a checklist are available from your local authority.\n\nWhat happens after I submit my application?\n\nAnyone can make a written submission or observation objecting to or supporting your planning application. It costs \u20ac20 to make a submission. Generally, the local planning authority must make a decision on a planning application within 8 weeks of receiving the application, but if the local authority needs more information, or the decision is appealed, it may take much longer. The decision will be notified in writing to you and anyone who commented on your application.\n\nIf my application is accepted\n\nIf the local authority decides to give you planning permission, you will get a notice of intention to grant planning permission. If no one appeals the decision to An Bord Plean\u00e1la within 4 weeks of the date of this decision, you will be granted planning permission from the local authority.\n\nIf my application is refused\n\nIf the local authority refuses your application, it will give you the reasons for this.

It can be approved or refused by the local authority. The planning permission process is used to stop inappropriate building and developments and approve those that are suitable.\n\nWhen do I need planning permission?\n\nYou will need planning permission if you are going to build a house. You may need planning permission if you want to build an extension or make other changes to your existing house . Some small extensions and conservatories do not need planning permission. You should always check this with your local authority before you start any building.\n\nYou will also need planning permission if you want to significantly change how you use your land or buildings. For example, you will need planning permission to open a cr\u00e8che on your property and you may need it if you are renting your property for short-term lets . There are some exceptions to this, for example, you do not need planning permission to change certain vacant commercial properties (including pubs) into homes. These exceptions are set out in the Planning and Development Regulations 2001 to 2021 .\n\nYou may also need planning permission for a modular home or building. This depends on a number of factors such as how big it is, where it will be situated and what it will be used for. A modular home is a home that is built off-site and then delivered and finished at the planned location. These homes are often known as rapid build homes as they are quicker to build. The Government is building rapid build homes in certain locations for families fleeing the war in Ukraine. Planning permission is not needed for this rapid build housing programme , but the Government must take environmental issues into account when choosing locations.\n\nYour local authority can advise if you will need planning permission and give you general advice about your application. Your local authority will also be able to tell you whether your proposals are likely to comply with the development plan for your area.\n\nWhat happens if I need planning permission but don\u2019t apply for it or get\n\nit?\n\nIt is an offence to do work that requires planning permission, without having planning permission. This offence can carry very large fines and possible imprisonment. However, if a genuine mistake has been made, it is possible to apply for planning permission to retain an unauthorised development. This permission can be refused, in which case, the unauthorised development will have to be demolished.\n\nTypes of planning permission\n\nThere are 2 types of planning permission:\n\nPermission\n\nOutline permission\n\nThe most common type of planning permission is permission , which is sometimes called full permission. This is where the local authority agrees to your work. Permission is normally subject to conditions, some of which may require changes to your proposals. Planning permission normally lasts for 5 years.\n\nOutline permission is where you apply to see if the local authority agrees in principle with you building a house or large extension.

You must have been aged 18\u201324, unemployed and getting a qualifying social welfare payment for at least 12 months \u2013 see 'Rules' below. If you were unemployed for less than 12 months, you must have faced a significant barrier to work to qualify.\n\nParticipation was voluntary. There was no financial penalties if you did not want to participate in the scheme or if you dropped out.\n\nThe scheme was open to host organisations in the private, community and voluntary sectors only. Public service bodies, including schools and colleges, could not host YESS placements.\n\nYESS was a scheme under the Irish Youth Guarantee .

The placement was monitored with monthly reporting to make sure that it continued to meet the scheme guidelines.\n\nTraining and development\n\nParticipants could get a Training Support Grant of up to \u20ac500 if needed. The grant was available up 2 times in a 12-month period. The grant was increased from \u20ac500 to \u20ac1,000 under the July Jobs Stimulus .\n\nDuration of scheme\n\nThe scheme lasted for 3 months, with the option to extend the placement to 6 months if the DSP agreed. Participants could spend a maximum of 6 months on a placement with the same host organisation.\n\nYou could be eligible to do 3 placements in total, up to a maximum period of 18 months (78 weeks).Document 1:::\n1671.363\n\nCOVID-19 recovery and cost of living business supports\n\nThis page summarises the supports for businesses as they recover from COVID-19 disruptions and deal with the rising costs of living.\n\n1452.6732\n\nYouth Employment Support Scheme (YESS)\n\nThe Youth Employment Support Scheme (YESS) is closed.

As a result, they are not strictly binding. This means that if you have a pre-nuptial agreement in place and you end up in court following the breakdown of your marriage, the judge is not bound by the terms of the pre-nuptial agreement.\n\nThe only provision in Irish law is under sections 113 and 113A of the Succession Act 1965 (as amended) where a spouse or a civil partner can renounce his/her legal right share in a pre-nuptial agreement.\n\nAlthough they are not legally binding, there is nothing in Irish law which stops a couple planning to marry from having and signing a pre-nuptial agreement. Importantly, such agreements can serve as guides for the courts in judicial separation and divorce cases. If a pre-nuptial agreement makes \u2018proper provision\u2019 for each person it is more likely to be persuasive on the judge. Therefore, in situations where one party is likely to inherit a significant family farm or business, it will guide the judge in the divorce or judicial separation on what the parties\u2019 intentions were at the outset.\n\nDrafting a pre-nuptial agreement\n\nOnly pre-nuptial agreements entered into following independent legal advice for both parties are likely to be taken into account. The court would have to be satisfied that there had been a complete disclosure of assets before the agreement was signed. It is also advisable for the agreement to provide for reviews:\n\nPeriodically (for example, every five years)\n\nIf children are born\n\nIf there is a major change in circumstances (for example, assets are purchased or sold)\n\nThe agreement should be in writing, be signed by each party and comply with the rules of contract law.\n\nThe future of pre-nuptial agreements\n\nIn April 2007, the Government published the Report of the Study Group on Pre-nuptial Agreements (pdf) . The report recommended that pre-nuptial agreements be legislated for by way of introducing a new Section 16(2)A of the Family Law Act 1995 and new Section 20(3)A of the Family Law (Divorce) Act 1996 so that the courts would be required to have regard to existing pre-nuptial agreements when making ancillary relief orders in judicial separation and divorce proceedings.\n\nThe report also recommended that the legislation should contain procedural guidelines, that is, how a pre-nuptial agreement is drawn up, what is required for it to be enforceable. It is recommended that it must be:\n\nIn writing, signed and witnessed\n\nMade after each party has received separate legal advice\n\nMade with full disclosure of financial information\n\nMade not less than 28 days before the marriage\n\nThe report also recommended that pre-nuptial agreements be reviewable on death. This is so that a court may make financial provision for a surviving spouse who may be unfairly affected by the provisions of a pre-nuptial agreement on the death of the other spouse in certain circumstances.\n\nThe report\u2019s recommendations have not yet been implemented.Document 1:::\nThe report also recommended that pre-nuptial agreements be reviewable on death. This is so that a court may make financial provision for a surviving spouse who may be unfairly affected by the provisions of a pre-nuptial agreement on the death of the other spouse in certain circumstances.\n\nThe report\u2019s recommendations have not yet been implemented.\n\nCohabitation agreements\n\nThe Civil Partnership and Certain Rights and Obligations of Cohabitants Act 2010 allows cohabitants to enter into a cohabitants\u2019 agreement to provide for financial matters during the relationship or when the relationship ends, whether through death or otherwise. However, the Act sets out that the agreement will only be valid if each person has had independent legal advice or the couple obtained legal advice together and have waived (in writing) the right to independent legal advice. The agreement must be in writing, signed by both parties and must comply with the general law of contract.\n\nThe Court can change or ignore such an agreement if its enforceability would cause serious injustice.\n\nFor further information on cohabitation, see \u2018 Rights of cohabiting couples (couples living together) \u2019.\n\n_Page edited: 18 November 2022 _\n\nRelated documents\n\nEmployment agreements and orders\n\nRead about the regulation of pay and conditions of employment for certain employment sectors\n\n1549.4264\n\nAgency agreements, trusts, and ordinary powers of attorney\n\nIf you need someone to act on your behalf, this page explains some of the arrangements available.\n\n1526.6041\n\nMaintenance orders and agreements\n\nWhat is maintenance and who has to pay it?

A pre-nuptial agreement is not legally binding, but it can serve as a guide for the courts on what the parties\u2019 intentions were at the outset of the marriage in judicial separation and divorce cases.\n\nYour property rights if you are not married\n\nIf you are cohabiting (living together but not married) and your relationship breaks down, the family home will belong to the person who holds the legal title to the home. This could be one of you, or both of you.\n\nYou are not married but your name is on the title deeds\n\nIf both your names are on the title deeds, you are both legal owners of the property. You jointly have to make decisions as to what will happen to the property.\n\nIf you cannot come to an agreement, you can apply to the court to have the property sold and the proceeds divided, or it may be possible to seek an order breaking up the property. This would allow each party to decide what to do with their portion. This may be possible where there is a lot of land connected to the family home, or if there is more than one residence on the property.\n\nYour name is not on the title deeds but you made contributions to the\n\npurchase of the house\n\nWhether you are married or not, if your name is not on the title deeds to the house, you may still be able to show that you have some ownership rights in relation to the house.\n\nThese rights are based on the fact that you may have made a contribution, (either directly or indirectly), to the purchase price of the house with the intention of gaining a share in the ownership of the house. Usually, if you can show that you made a contribution to the purchase price of the house, you will be entitled to a share in the house in some proportion to your contribution.\n\nFor example, if you paid off half of the mortgage (and the mortgage represented 90% of the purchase price), you may roughly be entitled to 45% of the ownership of the property.\n\nCivil Partnership and Certain Rights and Obligations of Cohabitants Act\n\n2010\n\nThe Civil Partnership and Certain Rights and Obligations of Cohabitants Act 2010 sets out certain legal rights and protections that cohabiting couples have, which may allow you seek redress in the courts. To qualify for any redress orders, such as a property adjustment order, cohabiting couples without children have to have lived together in an intimate and committed relationship for 5 years. If you have children together, it is 2 years.\n\nA court will only make such an order if it is satisfied that one partner was financially dependent on the other cohabitant partner.\n\nCohabitation agreements\n\nThe Act also provides for couples to enter into a \"cohabitation agreement\" to set out your financial interests and also determine what will happen with certain assets, such as property, if your relationship should end.\n\nA cohabitant\u2019s agreement can make things more straightforward in the event of a break-up. A court may vary (change aspects of) or set aside a cohabitants\u2019 agreement in exceptional circumstances where enforcing it would cause serious injustice.\n\nWhat if there are children involved?\n\nIf there are children involved, a relationship breakdown can be life-altering. It needs to be handled sensitively to ensure the children\u2019s best interests are prioritised.Document 3:::\nEnglish | Gaeilge\n\nYou are here: Home > Family and Relationships > Married couples > How marriage changes your legal status\n\nHow marriage changes your legal status\n\nMarriage\n\nMarriage\n\nMarriage is a legal agreement with significant legal implications.

This legal right share is:\n\nOne-half of your estate if you do not have children\n\nOne-third of your estate if you do have children\n\nYour spouse/civil partner does not have to go to court to get this share, as your executor must give this share where applicable. If you leave a gift to your spouse or civil partner in your will, they can choose to accept the gift instead of their legal right share, or they can insist on their legal right share (the specific gift can form part of the legal right share, but if it is less then your spouse can request more from the estate).\n\nYour executor must inform your spouse or civil partner in writing of their right to choose between these two options. Your spouse or civil partner must ask for their legal right share within 6 months of being notified, or within 12 months of the taking out of the Grant of Representation.\n\nWhere a legal right share does not apply\n\nYour spouse or civil partner can renounce (give up) their rights to the legal right share. This can be part of an agreement before marriage or civil partnership or the spouse or civil partner can give up their rights to benefit their children or other named beneficiaries.\n\nIf there is evidence of undue influence or evidence that the spouse or civil partner did not understand what they were doing, the renunciation may be challenged. It is normally advised that a spouse or civil partner get independent legal advice if renouncing their legal right share.\n\nThe legal right share can be lost where the spouse or civil partner is:\n\nConvicted of the murder, manslaughter or attempted murder of the deceased person\n\nConvicted of an offence against the deceased person or a child that carries a sentence of more than 2 years\n\nDivorce, separation and desertion\n\nSeparation agreements usually include a renunciation of both spouses\u2019 or civil partner\u2019s legal right share.\n\nIf you are divorced or your civil partnership was dissolved, you do not have to provide a legal right share.\n\nIf your spouse or civil partner deserted you for more than 2 years, they are not entitled to a legal right share unless they deserted you as a result of your behaviour (for example, domestic abuse).\n\nCohabiting partners\n\nPartners, who live with each other but are not married or in a civil partnership, have no automatic legal right to each other's estates, although under the redress scheme for cohabiting couples introduced by the Civil Partnership and Certain Rights and Obligations of Cohabitants Act 2010 a qualified cohabitant can apply for a share of the estate of a deceased cohabitant.\n\nYou can leave some or all of your estate to your partner but this does not cancel out the legal rights of a spouse or civil partner if you were married before to someone else and did not get divorced or had your civil partnership dissolved.\n\nRights of children under a will\n\nChildren do not have any absolute right to inherit any of their parent's estate if the parent has made a will. Children born inside or outside marriage and adopted children all have the same rights and there are no age restrictions.\n\nExample 1:\n\nQ: What documents do I need to apply online for a driver's license in Ireland?\nA: You need a Public Services Card and verified MyGovID, proof of your address if your address is different to the one you provided when you got your Public Services Card, proof that you are normally resident in Ireland if you are not an EU or EEA citizen, a medical report form, dated within one month if required, and a Certificate of Professional Competence (CPC) for professional drivers.\n\nExample 2:\n\nQ: What criteria do I need to meet to qualify for unemployment benefits in Ireland?\nA: You must be under 66 years of age, or under 70 years and\u202fdeferring your State Pension (Contributory), be unemployed (you must be unemployed for at least 4 days out of 7), have had a substantial loss of employment and as a result be unemployed for at least 4 days out of 7 (this does not apply to casual workers and part-time fire fighters), be capable of work, be available for and genuinely seeking work, and have enough social insurance (PRSI) contributions.\n\nExample 3:\nQ: What is the legal status of pre-nuptial agreements?\nA:\n\nPre-nuptial agreements have no basis in law in Ireland. As a result, they are not strictly binding. This means that if you have a pre-nuptial agreement in place and you end up in court following the breakdown of your marriage, the judge is not bound by the terms of the pre-nuptial agreement.\n\nThe only provision in Irish law is under sections 113 and 113A of the Succession Act 1965 (as amended) where a spouse or a civil partner can renounce his/her legal right share in a pre-nuptial agreement.\n\nAlthough they are not legally binding, there is nothing in Irish law which stops a couple planning to marry from having and signing a pre-nuptial agreement.
