It allows family members, friends, or professionals to step in and help with daily activities such as bathing, dressing, feeding, and personal hygiene. Respite care can also include emotional support, transportation services, and meals on wheels. The primary goal is to give the caregiver a chance to rest, recharge, and potentially seek additional training or support to better manage their caregiving duties. \n\nThe cost of respite care varies depending on the type of service needed and where it is provided. Some options may be covered by health insurance, while others require payment upfront or through third-party providers. Caregivers typically receive reimbursement for respite visits through their employer",

This means that if you have a pre-nuptial agreement in place and you end up in court following the breakdown of your marriage, the judge is not bound by the terms of the pre-nuptial agreement. The only provision in Irish law is under sections 113 and 113A of the Succession Act 1965 (as amended) where a spouse or a civil partner can renounce his/her legal right share in a pre-nuptial agreement. Although they are not legally binding, there is nothing in Irish law which stops a couple planning to marry from having and signing a pre-nuptial agreement. Importantly, such agreements can serve as guides for the courts in judicial separation and divorce cases. If a pre-nuptial agreement makes \u2018proper provision\u2019 for each person it is more likely to be persuasive on the judge. Therefore, in situations where one party is likely to inherit a significant family farm or business, it will guide the judge in the divorce or judicial separation on what the parties\u2019 intentions were at the outset.",
