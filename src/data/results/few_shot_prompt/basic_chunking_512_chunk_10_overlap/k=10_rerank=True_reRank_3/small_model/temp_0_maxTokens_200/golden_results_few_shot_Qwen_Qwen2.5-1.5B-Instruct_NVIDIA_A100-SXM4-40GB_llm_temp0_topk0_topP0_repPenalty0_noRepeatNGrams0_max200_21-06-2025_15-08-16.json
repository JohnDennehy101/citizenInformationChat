To establish ordinary residence, one must demonstrate continuous presence in the country over a certain timeframe, often requiring documentation such as utility bills, bank statements, or other forms of evidence showing consistent use of the property or location. The exact duration can vary by jurisdiction but generally includes periods where the individual has lived in the area regularly and maintained ties with it. It\u2019s important to note that while this term relates to taxation, it also affects various aspects of life, including voting rights, driving licenses, and sometimes even immigration policies. For instance, in some countries, having ordinary residence may allow one to vote in local elections or participate in community activities without needing to reside there permanently. However, the requirements and implications can differ significantly between nations",

This means that if you have a pre-nuptial agreement in place and you end up in court following the breakdown of your marriage, the judge is not bound by the terms of the pre-nuptial agreement. The only provision in Irish law is under sections 113 and 113A of the Succession Act 1965 (as amended) where a spouse or a civil partner can renounce his/her legal right share in a pre-nuptial agreement. Although they are not legally binding, there is nothing in Irish law which stops a couple planning to marry from having and signing a pre-nuptial agreement. Importantly, such agreements can serve as guides for the courts in judicial separation and divorce cases. If a pre-nuptial agreement makes \u2018proper provision\u2019 for each person it is more likely to be persuasive on the judge.

However, they require specific conditions such as mutual consent, full disclosure of financial information, and no undue influence on either party.
