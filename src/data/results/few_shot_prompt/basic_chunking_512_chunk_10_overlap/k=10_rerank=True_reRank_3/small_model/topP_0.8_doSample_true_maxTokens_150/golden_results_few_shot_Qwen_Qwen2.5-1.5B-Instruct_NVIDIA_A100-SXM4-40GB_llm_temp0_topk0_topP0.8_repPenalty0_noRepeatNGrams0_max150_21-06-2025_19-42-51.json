This means that if you have a pre-nuptial agreement in place and you end up in court following the breakdown of your marriage, the judge is not bound by the terms of the pre-nuptial agreement. The only provision in Irish law is under sections 113 and 113A of the Succession Act 1965 (as amended) where a spouse or a civil partner can renounce his/her legal right share in a pre-nuptial agreement. Although they are not legally binding, there is nothing in Irish law which stops a couple planning to marry from having and signing a pre-nuptial agreement. Importantly, such agreements can serve as guides for the courts in judicial separation and divorce cases. If a pre-nuptial agreement makes \u2018proper provision\u2019 for each person it is more likely to be persuasive on the judge. Therefore, in situations where one party is likely to inherit a significant family farm or business, it will guide the judge in the divorce or judicial separation on what the parties\u2019 intentions were at the outset.",

These agreements can specify how assets will be divided in case of dissolution, but they require certain formalities and must be entered into voluntarily by both parties with full understanding of the implications. The agreements are subject to court scrutiny and may be challenged based on fairness, undue influence, or lack of voluntariness. They cannot be used to avoid taxes or transfer ownership of assets without proper documentation and registration procedures. In summary, while they are enforceable, pre-nuptial agreements should be approached with caution due to potential legal challenges and uncertainties surrounding their validity and enforceability in Irish courts.",
