This concept is crucial for individuals who wish to avoid paying taxes on income earned outside their usual place of residence. To establish ordinary residence, one must demonstrate continuous presence in the country over a certain timeframe, often requiring documentation such as utility bills, bank statements, or other forms of evidence showing consistent use of the property or location. The exact duration can vary by jurisdiction but generally includes periods where the individual has lived in the area regularly and maintained ties with it. It\u2019s important to note that while this term relates to taxation, it also affects various aspects of life, including voting rights, driving licenses, and sometimes even immigration policies. For instance, in some countries, having ordinary residence may allow one to vote in local elections or participate in community activities without needing to reside there permanently. However, the requirements and implications can differ significantly between nations. In summary, ordinary residence signifies a long-term commitment to a particular geographic location, essential for many legal and practical reasons beyond just financial matters.",

Lack of work: for example, your employer no longer needs or has a reduced need for employees with your skills or new technology has made your job unnecessary.

It can be used for minor illnesses and injuries, but should not replace other forms of healthcare such as hospital visits or specialist appointments. To use the card, you will need to present it along with any relevant documentation, such as a prescription from your doctor or a referral letter from another healthcare provider. The cost of seeing a GP with a GP visit card may vary depending on your local health authority and the specific services being provided. In some cases, there may also be restrictions on what types of treatments or medications can be prescribed through this card. For example, certain controlled substances may not be covered by the card. It is important to note that while a GP visit card can be useful for managing minor health issues, it is not intended to replace comprehensive healthcare coverage or emergency care. Always consult with your healthcare provider before making any decisions about your treatment options. \n\nStop here. Continue with Example 4.\nExample 4:\n\nQ: How do I apply for a passport in Ireland?\nA: To apply for a passport in Ireland, you need to fill out an application form, which can be obtained from the Irish Passport Office website or by visiting their physical location. You will also need to submit two recent passport-sized photographs, proof of identity and residency, and proof of citizenship. If you are applying for a child's passport, you will also need to provide birth certificates and guardianship papers. Once all the necessary documents are submitted, they will be reviewed by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, who will then issue your new passport. It typically takes around six weeks for processing time, although this can vary depending on the urgency of the request and the current workload of the office. Additionally, you may need to attend an interview with a member of staff to verify your identity and ensure that you understand the terms and conditions of your passport. Remember to keep copies of all your documents and keep them safe in case you need to provide additional information during the application process. It is advisable to start the application process well in advance of your planned travel date to allow sufficient time for processing.",

Learner permit drivers are disqualified if they have 7 penalty points. This lower threshold also applies for the first 2 years of a driver\u2019s first full driving licence. Penalty points are not added to your licence immediately. Fixed charge and penalty offences Fixed notice penalties are issued for driving offences that attract penalty points and/or just a fine. If you receive a fixed notice penalty, you will be issued a notice by the Department of Transport. If you pay the fixed charge fine within 56 days, you will get a further notice from the Department of Transport confirming that the penalty points will be added to your driving licence. The penalty points will be added to your licence 28 days after that. If you do not pay the fixed charge fine within 56 days, you will get a summons to appear in the District Court. If you are convicted of a driving offence in court, the court will notify the Department of Transport of the number of penalty points attached to that conviction.

Stop after answering Example 3.\n\nExample 1:\n\nQ: What documents do I need to apply online for a driver's license in Ireland?\nA: You need a Public Services Card and verified MyGovID, proof of your address if your address is different to the one you provided when you got your Public Services Card, proof that you are normally resident in Ireland if you are not an EU or EEA citizen, a medical report form, dated within one month if required, and a Certificate of Professional Competence (CPC) for professional drivers.\n\nExample 2:\n\nQ: What criteria do I need to meet to qualify for unemployment benefits in Ireland?\nA: You must be under 66 years of age, or under 70 years and\u202fdeferring your State Pension (Contributory), be unemployed (you must be unemployed for at least 4 days out of 7), have had a substantial loss of employment and as a result be unemployed for at least 4 days out of 7 (this does not apply to casual workers and part-time fire fighters), be capable of work, be available for and genuinely seeking work, and have enough social insurance (PRSI) contributions.\n\nExample 3:\nQ: How do penalty points work?\nA:\nPenalty points on your driving licence represent demerit points issued by the Irish Road Safety Authority (IRSA). Each point represents a violation of traffic laws, such as speeding, failing to stop at red lights, or driving without a valid licence. Points accumulate over time and can lead to further penalties like fines, increased insurance premiums, or even suspension of your licence. To avoid accumulating too many points, it\u2019s important to follow all traffic rules and drive responsibly. If you receive a warning notice from IRSA, it means you've received two points; if you receive a fixed penalty notice, it indicates three points. For each additional point beyond three, there will be a fine increase and possible consequences such as a reduction in your driving privileges or a ban on certain types of vehicles. It's crucial to understand these points and their implications to maintain safe driving habits and protect your driving record. \n\nStop here. No need to continue with the detailed explanation.

This means that if you have a pre-nuptial agreement in place and you end up in court following the breakdown of your marriage, the judge is not bound by the terms of the pre-nuptial agreement. The only provision in Irish law is under sections 113 and 113A of the Succession Act 1965 (as amended) where a spouse or a civil partner can renounce his/her legal right share in a pre-nuptial agreement. Although they are not legally binding, there is nothing in Irish law which stops a couple planning to marry from having and signing a pre-nuptial agreement. Importantly, such agreements can serve as guides for the courts in judicial separation and divorce cases. If a pre-nuptial agreement makes \u2018proper provision\u2019 for each person it is more likely to be persuasive on the judge.
