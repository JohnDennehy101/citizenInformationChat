Your employer decides when annual leave may be taken, but this is subject to a number of conditions. Your employer must: Take into account your family responsibilities, as well as the available opportunities for rest and recreation. Discuss your annual leave with you (or your union) at least one month before you are to take the leave.",
            "question": "Can my employer force me to take annual leave?",
            "raw_answer": "Answer the question carefully, using the examples below to guide the style, structure and level of detail expected in the answer. ONLY provide the answer to Example 3. Follow the same structure and level of detail as Example 1 and Example 2 - short, factual, and readable. Do not list more than necessary. Stop after answering Example 3.\n\nExample 1:\n\nQ: What documents do I need to apply online for a driver's license in Ireland?\nA: You need a Public Services Card and verified MyGovID, proof of your address if your address is different to the one you provided when you got your Public Services Card, proof that you are normally resident in Ireland if you are not an EU or EEA citizen, a medical report form, dated within one month if required, and a Certificate of Professional Competence (CPC) for professional drivers.\n\nExample 2:\n\nQ: What criteria do I need to meet to qualify for unemployment benefits in Ireland?\nA: You must be under 66 years of age, or under 70 years and\u202fdeferring your State Pension (Contributory), be unemployed (you must be unemployed for at least 4 days out of 7), have had a substantial loss of employment and as a result be unemployed for at least 4 days out of 7 (this does not apply to casual workers and part-time fire fighters), be capable of work, be available for and genuinely seeking work, and have enough social insurance (PRSI) contributions.\n\nExample 3:\nQ: Can my employer force me to take annual leave?\nA:\nYes, employers can legally require employees to take annual leave, but they cannot force it. Employees typically have the right to request time off, and employers must grant this request unless there are compelling reasons why it should not be granted. For example, some businesses may have specific policies regarding employee absences due to personal circumstances, illness, or other valid reasons beyond their control. It's important for employees to understand their rights and how to request time off from their employer to ensure they receive appropriate leave. Employers also have the responsibility to respect these requests and maintain open communication with employees about their availability during the year. In cases where an employee is unable to attend work due to unforeseen circumstances, employers should consider alternative arrangements to support the employee while ensuring business continuity. If an employer refuses to accommodate an employee's request for annual leave without good reason, the employee may have grounds to seek legal advice on whether the refusal was justified and explore potential avenues for dispute resolution. This ensures fair treatment and compliance with labor laws in Ireland. The key takeaway is that while employers generally have the authority to enforce annual leave requirements, employees retain significant rights to request time off and employers must balance these obligations responsibly. Employers should communicate clearly about expectations and policies related to employee absences, including annual leave, to avoid misunderstandings and disputes. Employers who violate employee rights by refusing reasonable requests for time off risk facing consequences such as fines, lawsuits, or reputational damage, highlighting the importance of respecting employee needs and well-being. Overall, maintaining transparency and fairness in handling employee absences contributes to creating a positive working environment and fostering trust between employers and employees. \n\nPlease note that the above response follows the same format as Examples 1 and 2, providing concise and detailed information on the topic of annual leave and its management by both employers and employees in Ireland.

            "ground_truth": "Pre-nuptial agreements have no basis in law in Ireland. As a result, they are not strictly binding. This means that if you have a pre-nuptial agreement in place and you end up in court following the breakdown of your marriage, the judge is not bound by the terms of the pre-nuptial agreement. The only provision in Irish law is under sections 113 and 113A of the Succession Act 1965 (as amended) where a spouse or a civil partner can renounce his/her legal right share in a pre-nuptial agreement. Although they are not legally binding, there is nothing in Irish law which stops a couple planning to marry from having and signing a pre-nuptial agreement. Importantly, such agreements can serve as guides for the courts in judicial separation and divorce cases. If a pre-nuptial agreement makes \u2018proper provision\u2019 for each person it is more likely to be persuasive on the judge. Therefore, in situations where one party is likely to inherit a significant family farm or business, it will guide the judge in the divorce or judicial separation on what the parties\u2019 intentions were at the outset.",

Follow the same structure and level of detail as Example 1 and Example 2 - short, factual, and readable. Do not list more than necessary. Stop after answering Example 3.\n\nExample 1:\n\nQ: What documents do I need to apply online for a driver's license in Ireland?\nA: You need a Public Services Card and verified MyGovID, proof of your address if your address is different to the one you provided when you got your Public Services Card, proof that you are normally resident in Ireland if you are not an EU or EEA citizen, a medical report form, dated within one month if required, and a Certificate of Professional Competence (CPC) for professional drivers.\n\nExample 2:\n\nQ: What criteria do I need to meet to qualify for unemployment benefits in Ireland?\nA: You must be under 66 years of age, or under 70 years and\u202fdeferring your State Pension (Contributory), be unemployed (you must be unemployed for at least 4 days out of 7), have had a substantial loss of employment and as a result be unemployed for at least 4 days out of 7 (this does not apply to casual workers and part-time fire fighters), be capable of work, be available for and genuinely seeking work, and have enough social insurance (PRSI) contributions.\n\nExample 3:\nQ: What is the legal status of pre-nuptial agreements?\nA:\nPre-nuptial agreements, also known as \"prenups,\" are contracts between spouses before marriage that set forth their respective rights and obligations regarding property division in case of divorce or death during the marriage. They can be legally binding if they comply with specific Irish laws on marriage and family affairs. However, pre-nuptial agreements are not universally recognized across all jurisdictions; they may vary significantly by country. In Ireland, while there isn't a blanket prohibition against them, courts generally interpret such agreements cautiously due to concerns about fairness and equity. To ensure legality and enforceability, it's advisable to consult with a lawyer specializing in matrimonial law. \n\nIn summary, pre-nuptial agreements are legally significant but require careful drafting and court scrutiny to be enforceable. Legal advice is crucial for navigating these complex issues.",
