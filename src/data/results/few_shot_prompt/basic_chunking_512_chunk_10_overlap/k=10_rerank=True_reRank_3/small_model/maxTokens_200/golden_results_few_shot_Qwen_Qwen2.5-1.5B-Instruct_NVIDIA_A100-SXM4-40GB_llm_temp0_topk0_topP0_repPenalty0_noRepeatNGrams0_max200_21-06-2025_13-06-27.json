Stop after answering Example 3.\n\nExample 1:\n\nQ: What documents do I need to apply online for a driver's license in Ireland?\nA: You need a Public Services Card and verified MyGovID, proof of your address if your address is different to the one you provided when you got your Public Services Card, proof that you are normally resident in Ireland if you are not an EU or EEA citizen, a medical report form, dated within one month if required, and a Certificate of Professional Competence (CPC) for professional drivers.\n\nExample 2:\n\nQ: What criteria do I need to meet to qualify for unemployment benefits in Ireland?\nA: You must be under 66 years of age, or under 70 years and\u202fdeferring your State Pension (Contributory), be unemployed (you must be unemployed for at least 4 days out of 7), have had a substantial loss of employment and as a result be unemployed for at least 4 days out of 7 (this does not apply to casual workers and part-time fire fighters), be capable of work, be available for and genuinely seeking work, and have enough social insurance (PRSI) contributions.\n\nExample 3:\nQ: How do penalty points work?\nA:\nPenalty points are used by the Irish Road Safety Authority to manage driving offenses such as speeding, drink-driving, and parking violations. Points are assigned based on the severity of the offense; for example, speeding can earn up to 6 points per incident. Drivers accumulate these points over time until they reach the maximum limit set by law, which varies depending on their previous record. If a driver accumulates a certain number of points, typically 12, they may face additional penalties including a fine, community service, or even suspension of their driving license. It\u2019s important for drivers to understand how many points they are likely to receive from each offense to avoid accumulating too many points and potentially facing significant consequences. The exact rules regarding point accumulation and penalties can vary slightly between minor and major offenses, so it\u2019s advisable to consult the most recent guidelines issued by the IRSA for accurate information.",

This means that if you have a pre-nuptial agreement in place and you end up in court following the breakdown of your marriage, the judge is not bound by the terms of the pre-nuptial agreement. The only provision in Irish law is under sections 113 and 113A of the Succession Act 1965 (as amended) where a spouse or a civil partner can renounce his/her legal right share in a pre-nuptial agreement. Although they are not legally binding, there is nothing in Irish law which stops a couple planning to marry from having and signing a pre-nuptial agreement.
