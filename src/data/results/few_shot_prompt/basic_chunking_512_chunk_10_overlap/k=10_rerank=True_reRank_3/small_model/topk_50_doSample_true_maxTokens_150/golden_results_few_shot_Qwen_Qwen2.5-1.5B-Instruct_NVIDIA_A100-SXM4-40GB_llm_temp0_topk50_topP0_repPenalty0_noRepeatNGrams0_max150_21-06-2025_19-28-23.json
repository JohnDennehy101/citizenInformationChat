It typically involves paid or unpaid caregivers taking breaks away from their regular duties to rest, recharge, or attend to personal needs while someone else takes over caring for the individual in need. This can include activities such as visiting the person in their home, hiring a caregiver to assist them during certain hours, or arranging for a professional service like housekeeping or meal preparation. The goal is to help ensure the well-being and quality of life for both the caregiver and the person receiving care. Respite care supports continuity of care by allowing families to manage their own lives and seek other forms of support without disrupting daily routines or financial stability.",

This means that if you have a pre-nuptial agreement in place and you end up in court following the breakdown of your marriage, the judge is not bound by the terms of the pre-nuptial agreement. The only provision in Irish law is under sections 113 and 113A of the Succession Act 1965 (as amended) where a spouse or a civil partner can renounce his/her legal right share in a pre-nuptial agreement. Although they are not legally binding, there is nothing in Irish law which stops a couple planning to marry from having and signing a pre-nuptial agreement. Importantly, such agreements can serve as guides for the courts in judicial separation and divorce cases. If a pre-nuptial agreement makes \u2018proper provision\u2019 for each person it is more likely to be persuasive on the judge. Therefore, in situations where one party is likely to inherit a significant family farm or business, it will guide the judge in the divorce or judicial separation on what the parties\u2019 intentions were at the outset.",
