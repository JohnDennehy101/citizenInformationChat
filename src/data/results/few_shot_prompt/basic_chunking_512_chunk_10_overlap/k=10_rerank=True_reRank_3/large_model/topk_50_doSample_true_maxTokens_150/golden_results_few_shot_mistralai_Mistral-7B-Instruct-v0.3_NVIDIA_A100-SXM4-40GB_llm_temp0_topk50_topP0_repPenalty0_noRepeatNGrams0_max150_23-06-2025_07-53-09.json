Your employer may advise you to take some sick leave and use your annual leave at a later date. The rules regarding sick leave and pay are determined by your employer, so it is best to check with them. If you are eligible for sick pay, your employer should make the necessary arrangements for you to receive it. It is important to remember that you are legally entitled to be away from work if you are sick, subject to the terms of your employment and company policy. If your employer refuses to pay you sick pay while you are on annual leave, you should contact the Workplace Relations Commission for advice.",

            "ground_truth": "Pre-nuptial agreements have no basis in law in Ireland. As a result, they are not strictly binding. This means that if you have a pre-nuptial agreement in place and you end up in court following the breakdown of your marriage, the judge is not bound by the terms of the pre-nuptial agreement. The only provision in Irish law is under sections 113 and 113A of the Succession Act 1965 (as amended) where a spouse or a civil partner can renounce his/her legal right share in a pre-nuptial agreement. Although they are not legally binding, there is nothing in Irish law which stops a couple planning to marry from having and signing a pre-nuptial agreement. Importantly, such agreements can serve as guides for the courts in judicial separation and divorce cases. If a pre-nuptial agreement makes \u2018proper provision\u2019 for each person it is more likely to be persuasive on the judge. Therefore, in situations where one party is likely to inherit a significant family farm or business, it will guide the judge in the divorce or judicial separation on what the parties\u2019 intentions were at the outset.",
