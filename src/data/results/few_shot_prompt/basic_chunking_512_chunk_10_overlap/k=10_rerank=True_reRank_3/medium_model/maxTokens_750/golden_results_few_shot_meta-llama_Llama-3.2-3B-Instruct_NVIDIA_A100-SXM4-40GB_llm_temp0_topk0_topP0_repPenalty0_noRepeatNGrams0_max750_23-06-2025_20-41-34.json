            "ground_truth": "Pre-nuptial agreements have no basis in law in Ireland. As a result, they are not strictly binding. This means that if you have a pre-nuptial agreement in place and you end up in court following the breakdown of your marriage, the judge is not bound by the terms of the pre-nuptial agreement. The only provision in Irish law is under sections 113 and 113A of the Succession Act 1965 (as amended) where a spouse or a civil partner can renounce his/her legal right share in a pre-nuptial agreement. Although they are not legally binding, there is nothing in Irish law which stops a couple planning to marry from having and signing a pre-nuptial agreement. Importantly, such agreements can serve as guides for the courts in judicial separation and divorce cases. If a pre-nuptial agreement makes \u2018proper provision\u2019 for each person it is more likely to be persuasive on the judge. Therefore, in situations where one party is likely to inherit a significant family farm or business, it will guide the judge in the divorce or judicial separation on what the parties\u2019 intentions were at the outset.",

Follow the same structure and level of detail as Example 1 and Example 2 - short, factual, and readable. Do not list more than necessary. Stop after answering Example 3.\n\nExample 1:\n\nQ: What documents do I need to apply online for a driver's license in Ireland?\nA: You need a Public Services Card and verified MyGovID, proof of your address if your address is different to the one you provided when you got your Public Services Card, proof that you are normally resident in Ireland if you are not an EU or EEA citizen, a medical report form, dated within one month if required, and a Certificate of Professional Competence (CPC) for professional drivers.\n\nExample 2:\n\nQ: What criteria do I need to meet to qualify for unemployment benefits in Ireland?\nA: You must be under 66 years of age, or under 70 years and\u202fdeferring your State Pension (Contributory), be unemployed (you must be unemployed for at least 4 days out of 7), have had a substantial loss of employment and as a result be unemployed for at least 4 days out of 7 (this does not apply to casual workers and part-time fire fighters), be capable of work, be available for and genuinely seeking work, and have enough social insurance (PRSI) contributions.\n\nExample 3:\nQ: What is the legal status of pre-nuptial agreements?\nA:\nA pre-nuptial agreement is a contract between two people who are about to get married. It sets out what happens to their property in the event of a divorce or separation. The legal status of pre-nuptial agreements varies from country to country. In Ireland, pre-nuptial agreements are not legally binding in the event of a divorce or separation, and the courts can disregard them if they are deemed to be unfair or unreasonable. However, they can be used as evidence of the parties' intentions, and can also be used as a basis for a settlement in a divorce or separation.",
