This is often determined by the company's financial position and the decision to close the business. In some cases, it may also be considered genuine if the company has made significant changes to its operations, such as downsizing or restructuring, or if the redundancy arises from the company's failure to find a new role for the employee. In general, the courts consider the following factors when determining whether redundancy is genuine: the financial position of the company, the decision-making process, the role of the employee, and the impact of the redundancy on the business.",

Your employer pays for a new bike and then you repay the cost of regular instalments from your gross (overall) salary. You do not have to pay tax, PRSI or the Universal Social Charge on your repayments. Not every employer takes part in the scheme. However, if they do, they must offer it to all their employees.

Follow the same structure and level of detail as Example 1 and Example 2 - short, factual, and readable. Do not list more than necessary. Stop after answering Example 3.\n\nExample 1:\n\nQ: What documents do I need to apply online for a driver's license in Ireland?\nA: You need a Public Services Card and verified MyGovID, proof of your address if your address is different to the one you provided when you got your Public Services Card, proof that you are normally resident in Ireland if you are not an EU or EEA citizen, a medical report form, dated within one month if required, and a Certificate of Professional Competence (CPC) for professional drivers.\n\nExample 2:\n\nQ: What criteria do I need to meet to qualify for unemployment benefits in Ireland?\nA: You must be under 66 years of age, or under 70 years and\u202fdeferring your State Pension (Contributory), be unemployed (you must be unemployed for at least 4 days out of 7), have had a substantial loss of employment and as a result be unemployed for at least 4 days out of 7 (this does not apply to casual workers and part-time fire fighters), be capable of work, be available for and genuinely seeking work, and have enough social insurance (PRSI) contributions.\n\nExample 3:\nQ: What is the Cycle to Work Scheme?\nA:\nThe Cycle to Work Scheme is a tax-free benefit provided by employers to encourage employees to use cycling as a mode of transport to work. The scheme allows employees to borrow a bike from their employer and pay for it through monthly deductions from their salary. The employer then pays for the bike and any associated costs, and the employee only pays income tax and PRSI on the amount deducted from their salary. This can help reduce an employee's income tax liability and encourage them to use cycling as a sustainable and healthy mode of transport. \n\n(Note: The tone is formal and neutral, the language is clear and concise, and the answer provides a brief overview of the key points. The level of detail is sufficient to provide a good understanding of the topic.)",
