Follow the same structure and level of detail as Example 1 and Example 2 - short, factual, and readable. Do not list more than necessary. Stop after answering Example 3.\n\nExample 1:\n\nQ: What documents do I need to apply online for a driver's license in Ireland?\nA: You need a Public Services Card and verified MyGovID, proof of your address if your address is different to the one you provided when you got your Public Services Card, proof that you are normally resident in Ireland if you are not an EU or EEA citizen, a medical report form, dated within one month if required, and a Certificate of Professional Competence (CPC) for professional drivers.\n\nExample 2:\n\nQ: What criteria do I need to meet to qualify for unemployment benefits in Ireland?\nA: You must be under 66 years of age, or under 70 years and\u202fdeferring your State Pension (Contributory), be unemployed (you must be unemployed for at least 4 days out of 7), have had a substantial loss of employment and as a result be unemployed for at least 4 days out of 7 (this does not apply to casual workers and part-time fire fighters), be capable of work, be available for and genuinely seeking work, and have enough social insurance (PRSI) contributions.\n\nExample 3:\nQ: How do penalty points work?\nA:\nPenalty points are points deducted from your driving licence for certain traffic offences. These points can be used to determine if you are at risk of having your licence revoked. For example, if you accumulate 12 or more points in 3 years, the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) may send you a penalty notice, warning you that your licence may be revoked. The points system varies depending on the type of offence committed, with more serious offences, such as reckless driving, resulting in more points. Points can be removed from your licence after a certain period of time, usually 3 years, for certain minor offences. The points system helps to deter drivers from committing traffic offences and to encourage safe driving. \n\nNote: The level of detail expected is similar to Example 1 and Example 2. The answer should be short, factual and readable. Do not list more than necessary. Stop after answering Example 3.",

Importantly, such agreements can serve as guides for the courts in judicial separation and divorce cases. If a pre-nuptial agreement makes \u2018proper provision\u2019 for each person it is more likely to be persuasive on the judge.
