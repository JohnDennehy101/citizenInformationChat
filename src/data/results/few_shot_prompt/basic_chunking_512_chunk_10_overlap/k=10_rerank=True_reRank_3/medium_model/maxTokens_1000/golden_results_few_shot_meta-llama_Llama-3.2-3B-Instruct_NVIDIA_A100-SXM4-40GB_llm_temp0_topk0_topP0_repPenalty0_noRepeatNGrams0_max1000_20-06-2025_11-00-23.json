The HSE assesses your eligibility for a medical card on a case-by-case basis, taking into account the nature and severity of your medical condition. The card is usually issued for a period of 1 year, but can be renewed if your medical condition remains unchanged. If you have a medical condition that is not deemed severe enough to warrant free medical treatment, you may be eligible for a reduced rate or free treatment through the General Medical Services (GMS) scheme. \n\nPlease note that the level of detail and structure should be similar to Example 1 and Example 2.",

This means that if you have a pre-nuptial agreement in place and you end up in court following the breakdown of your marriage, the judge is not bound by the terms of the pre-nuptial agreement. The only provision in Irish law is under sections 113 and 113A of the Succession Act 1965 (as amended) where a spouse or a civil partner can renounce his/her legal right share in a pre-nuptial agreement. Although they are not legally binding, there is nothing in Irish law which stops a couple planning to marry from having and signing a pre-nuptial agreement. Importantly, such agreements can serve as guides for the courts in judicial separation and divorce cases. If a pre-nuptial agreement makes \u2018proper provision\u2019 for each person it is more likely to be persuasive on the judge. Therefore, in situations where one party is likely to inherit a significant family farm or business, it will guide the judge in the divorce or judicial separation on what the parties\u2019 intentions were at the outset.",

In Ireland, pre-nuptial agreements are legally recognized and can be used to outline how property and other assets will be divided in the event of a divorce or separation. The Family Law Act 2019 provides that pre-nuptial agreements can be made by couples who are not related by blood or marriage, and that they must be in writing, signed by both parties, and witnessed by a solicitor or a notary public. The agreement must also be registered with the Registrar of Civil Marriage. If the couple is married in Ireland, the pre-nuptial agreement can be incorporated into their marriage contract. However, if the couple is married in another country, the pre-nuptial agreement must be recognized by the courts of Ireland.",
