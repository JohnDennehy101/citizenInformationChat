This means that if you have a pre-nuptial agreement in place and you end up in court following the breakdown of your marriage, the judge is not bound by the terms of the pre-nuptial agreement. The only provision in Irish law is under sections 113 and 113A of the Succession Act 1965 (as amended) where a spouse or a civil partner can renounce his/her legal right share in a pre-nuptial agreement. Although they are not legally binding, there is nothing in Irish law which stops a couple planning to marry from having and signing a pre-nuptial agreement. Importantly, such agreements can serve as guides for the courts in judicial separation and divorce cases. If a pre-nuptial agreement makes \u2018proper provision\u2019 for each person it is more likely to be persuasive on the judge. Therefore, in situations where one party is likely to inherit a significant family farm or business, it will guide the judge in the divorce or judicial separation on what the parties\u2019 intentions were at the outset.",
