            "answer": "A Police Certificate is a document issued by the Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na (Ireland's national police service) that provides information about an individual's criminal record. The certificate is issued in response to a request from a third party, such as an employer or a background check service. The certificate is typically issued after a background check has been conducted, and it may contain information about past convictions, warnings, or other relevant details. The certificate is usually valid for a specific period of time, after which it may need to be updated or renewed. The Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na maintains a central database of police records, which is used to issue Police Certificates. The certificate is an important document that can be used to verify an individual's criminal history. \n\nPlease note that the examples are for illustration purposes only.

If you pay the fixed charge fine within 56 days, you will get a further notice from the Department of Transport confirming that the penalty points will be added to your driving licence. The penalty points will be added to your licence 28 days after that. If you do not pay the fixed charge fine within 56 days, you will get a summons to appear in the District Court.

Respite care can be used to help manage the stress and pressure of caregiving, and can be tailored to meet the individual needs of the person being cared for.",

This means that if you have a pre-nuptial agreement in place and you end up in court following the breakdown of your marriage, the judge is not bound by the terms of the pre-nuptial agreement. The only provision in Irish law is under sections 113 and 113A of the Succession Act 1965 (as amended) where a spouse or a civil partner can renounce his/her legal right share in a pre-nuptial agreement. Although they are not legally binding, there is nothing in Irish law which stops a couple planning to marry from having and signing a pre-nuptial agreement. Importantly, such agreements can serve as guides for the courts in judicial separation and divorce cases. If a pre-nuptial agreement makes \u2018proper provision\u2019 for each person it is more likely to be persuasive on the judge. Therefore, in situations where one party is likely to inherit a significant family farm or business, it will guide the judge in the divorce or judicial separation on what the parties\u2019 intentions were at the outset.",

It outlines the division of property and financial responsibilities in the event of a divorce or separation. In Ireland, pre-nuptial agreements are recognized as a valid form of contract under the Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2017. This Act provides that a pre-nuptial agreement can be made, and it can be registered with the Registry of the Supreme Court. The terms of the agreement can be reviewed and modified during the marriage, but it can only be terminated by a court order. In general, a pre-nuptial agreement must be made before the marriage and signed by both parties, and it must be in writing.

You can claim the full cost of the bike and accessories, and you will not pay income tax or PRSI on the value of the bike. You will need to pay VAT on the bike and accessories, but this will be reclaimed by your employer.
