Before 1 January 2005, everyone born on the island of Ireland was an Irish citizen by birth. Following an amendment to the Constitution of Ireland , citizenship by birth is no longer an automatic entitlement to everyone born on the island of Ireland.\n\nIf you are born abroad, you are entitled to Irish citizenship if your parent was born in Ireland. If your grandparents were born in Ireland, you may also be able to claim citizenship through the Foreign Births Register .\n\nResidents of Ireland who have come from abroad can apply to become Irish citizens through naturalisation .\n\nCitizens of Ireland are also EU citizens, which means that they can live, work and study in any other EU member state.\n\nThis page describes who can claim or apply for Irish citizenship, the rights that Irish citizens enjoy and answers some general questions on Irish citizenship law.\n\nIrish citizenship and the law\n\nIrish citizenship in the Constitution of Ireland\n\nThe Constitution of Ireland is the basic law of the State and was adopted in 1937. It replaced the Constitution of the Irish Free State .\n\nThe Constitution of the Irish Free State granted citizenship to anyone living in the territory of the Irish Free State who:\n\nAt the time of the enacting of the constitution lived in the territory of the Irish Free State\n\nand\n\nWas born in Ireland, or was the son or daughter of someone who was born in Ireland or\n\nLived in Ireland for 7 years or more\n\nIt did not give citizenship rights to anyone born after the enacting of the Constitution of the Irish Free State. Instead, it said that this would be set out in law.Document 1:::\nThe Good Friday Agreement , which was signed between the Irish and British governments in 1998, confirmed that people born in Northern Ireland could choose to be either British or Irish citizens.\n\nSince 1 January 2005, if you are born in Northern Ireland, you can claim Irish citizenship if your parent (or parents) are either British or Irish citizens, or one of them has lived on the island of Ireland for at least 3 out of the 4 years immediately before your birth.\n\nYou can read more about citizenship by birth or descent .\n\nWho is entitled to Irish citizenship?\n\nYou are entitled to claim Irish citizenship if any one of the following applies:\n\n1.

You were born abroad and any of the following apply to you:\n\nOne (or both of your parents) was born in Ireland and was entitled to Irish citizenship\n\nYour grandparent was born in Ireland and you have entered your birth on the Foreign Births Register\n\nAt the time of your birth, your parent had become an Irish citizen by registering with the Foreign Births Register or by naturalisation.

You were born in Ireland and are not entitled to be a citizen of any\n\nother country.\n\nYou can read about citizenship by birth .\n\nWho is entitled to apply for Irish citizenship by naturalisation?\n\nIf you are not entitled to citizenship by birth or descent, you can apply to become an Irish citizen by naturalisation .\n\nExample 1:\n\nQ: What documents do I need to apply online for a driver's license in Ireland?\nA: You need a Public Services Card and verified MyGovID, proof of your address if your address is different to the one you provided when you got your Public Services Card, proof that you are normally resident in Ireland if you are not an EU or EEA citizen, a medical report form, dated within one month if required, and a Certificate of Professional Competence (CPC) for professional drivers.\n\nExample 2:\n\nQ: What criteria do I need to meet to qualify for unemployment benefits in Ireland?\nA: You must be under 66 years of age, or under 70 years and\u202fdeferring your State Pension (Contributory), be unemployed (you must be unemployed for at least 4 days out of 7), have had a substantial loss of employment and as a result be unemployed for at least 4 days out of 7 (this does not apply to casual workers and part-time fire fighters), be capable of work, be available for and genuinely seeking work, and have enough social insurance (PRSI) contributions.\n\nExample 3:\nQ: Who is entitled to Irish citizenship?\nA:\n\n1.

Lack of work: for example, your employer no longer needs or has a reduced need for employees with your skills or new technology has made your job unnecessary. Reorganisation within the business: for example, your employer has decided to carry on the business with fewer or no staff or the job you do no longer exists. Business closure: the business is closing down or moving.",

This is known as constructive dismissal.\n\nWhat does not count as \u2018unfair\u2019 dismissal?\n\nYour dismissal from work is not \u2018unfair\u2019 if it results from:\n\nYour capability, competence or qualifications for the job\n\nYour conduct (behaviour)\n\nYou being unable to work (or continue to work) in the position you held without breaking the law (for example, if your job involves driving and you are then legally disqualified from driving)\n\nYour redundancy (read more about redundancy below)\n\nIn general, redundancy is a fair reason for dismissal. However, you may have grounds (reasons) for complaint if you were unfairly selected for redundancy , or if you feel there was no genuine need for redundancy.\n\nUnless your employer can prove there was a genuine redundancy situation and that they followed fair procedures , your dismissal may be considered \u2018unfair\u2019.\n\nIf you make a claim for unfair dismissal, you cannot also claim redundancy.\n\nCan I bring a claim for unfair dismissal?\n\nExample 1:\n\nQ: What documents do I need to apply online for a driver's license in Ireland?\nA: You need a Public Services Card and verified MyGovID, proof of your address if your address is different to the one you provided when you got your Public Services Card, proof that you are normally resident in Ireland if you are not an EU or EEA citizen, a medical report form, dated within one month if required, and a Certificate of Professional Competence (CPC) for professional drivers.\n\nExample 2:\n\nQ: What criteria do I need to meet to qualify for unemployment benefits in Ireland?\nA: You must be under 66 years of age, or under 70 years and\u202fdeferring your State Pension (Contributory), be unemployed (you must be unemployed for at least 4 days out of 7), have had a substantial loss of employment and as a result be unemployed for at least 4 days out of 7 (this does not apply to casual workers and part-time fire fighters), be capable of work, be available for and genuinely seeking work, and have enough social insurance (PRSI) contributions.\n\nExample 3:\nQ: What counts as genuine redundancy?\nA:\nA genuine redundancy is one where your employer has a real business reason to make you redundant.

It can also be used to renovate vacant and derelict properties that have not been used as residential properties before. However, this only applies if the non-residential properties were used for commercial or public use before and now have the correct planning permission. You can get the grant if you are refurbishing the vacant property so you can live there, or so you can rent the property out. You can get a grant of up to \u20ac50,000 to renovate a vacant property and up to \u20ac70,000, if the property is derelict. You can get more if you are living on an off-shore island. And, there is an additional grant for expert conservation advice if you are refurbishing a vacant traditional farmhouse. The Vacant Property Refurbishment Grant is funded by the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage through the Cro\u00ed C\u00f3naithe (Towns) Fund and you apply to your local authority.

This means you can get 2 weeks off in a row.\n\nHoliday pay\n\nHoliday pay (pay for annual leave) must be paid in advance at your normal weekly rate .\n\nIf your pay changes from week-to-week (for example, because of commission or bonus payments), your holiday pay is the average of your pay over the 13 weeks before you take holidays.\n\nPart-time employees\n\nGenerally, annual leave for part-time workers is calculated using Method 3 above. This means you can get 8% of your hours worked.\n\nIf you work full time for some months and part-time for the rest of the year, you should calculate the leave for the full-time and the part-time periods of work separately.\n\nAgency employees\n\nIf you are an agency worker, the party who pays your wages (employment agency or client company) is the employer for the purposes of the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997 , and is responsible for providing your annual leave entitlement.\n\nCan my employer force me to take annual leave?\n\nUsually, employees can ask to take annual leave at specific times.

Depending on your employer, you can agree to take your annual leave within 6 months of the relevant leave year.Document 1:::\nYou must be paid at your normal daily rate of pay . Your employer should not make any reference to domestic violence leave on your payslip.\n\nWhat is normal daily pay?\n\nYour normal daily pay includes any regular bonus or allowance which does not change from week to week (but excludes overtime or commission).\n\nIf your pay changes from week to week , your pay for domestic violence leave is the average of your pay over the 13 weeks before you are on leave. This could be, for example, because of regular bonus payments or allowances.\n\nHow to apply\n\nCheck if your employer has a workplace domestic violence policy and follow the process to apply for the leave and other supports available.\n\nDo I need to give notice to my employer?\n\nYou do not have to give your employer notice to take domestic violence leave in emergency circumstances.\n\nYou should give notice if you are able to, or as soon as you practically can after taking it.\n\nDisclosing your experience to your employer\n\nGetting support from your employer means you need to disclose your experience to someone at work. In most jobs, employees usually tell their direct manager about absences.\n\nOr, your employer may assign a specific or designated person to handle matters related to domestic violence leave and other available support. The designated person could be a HR manager or the business owner.\n\nYour employer should make sure the designated person is well-trained to handle employee disclosures properly.\n\nCan my employer ask for proof?\n\nYou are not required to give your employer any supporting information or evidence when requesting domestic violence leave.\n\nThere might be exceptional situations where your employer could ask for supporting documents, but this would be rare and is not in line with the intentions of the law.\n\nConfidentiality\n\nYour employer should treat any information you disclose about domestic violence with the utmost sensitivity and confidentiality.\n\nThey should only share the information with those who need it for safety plans or administering domestic violence leave. Ideally, your employer should get your written permission before sharing any information.\n\nSharing information does not always mean breaking confidentiality. Your employer can find ways to share details without revealing your identity or the fact that you disclosed domestic violence.\n\nYour employment rights\n\nIn general, you will be treated as if you are in work during domestic violence leave.\n\nThis means:\n\nYour time on domestic violence leave does not break your continuous service. It also counts as service when calculating entitlements such as annual leave and public holidays.\n\nYou must not be dismissed for taking or asking to take domestic violence leave.\n\nExample 1:\n\nQ: What documents do I need to apply online for a driver's license in Ireland?\nA: You need a Public Services Card and verified MyGovID, proof of your address if your address is different to the one you provided when you got your Public Services Card, proof that you are normally resident in Ireland if you are not an EU or EEA citizen, a medical report form, dated within one month if required, and a Certificate of Professional Competence (CPC) for professional drivers.\n\nExample 2:\n\nQ: What criteria do I need to meet to qualify for unemployment benefits in Ireland?\nA: You must be under 66 years of age, or under 70 years and\u202fdeferring your State Pension (Contributory), be unemployed (you must be unemployed for at least 4 days out of 7), have had a substantial loss of employment and as a result be unemployed for at least 4 days out of 7 (this does not apply to casual workers and part-time fire fighters), be capable of work, be available for and genuinely seeking work, and have enough social insurance (PRSI) contributions.\n\nExample 3:\nQ: Can my employer force me to take annual leave?\nA:\nUsually, employees can ask to take annual leave at specific times.

Even if you don\u2019t qualify for the weekly payment, you may get PRSI credited contributions which can help you qualify for future social welfare payments.\n\nIf you don\u2019t qualify for Illness Benefit or while you are waiting for a decision on your claim for Illness Benefit, you may get a Supplementary Welfare Allowance .\n\nIllness Benefit can be paid abroad in some situations. Find out about the rules for getting Illness Benefit abroad .\n\nEmployer policy on sick pay and Illness Benefit\n\nYou should apply for Illness Benefit while you are out sick from work, whether your employer pays you or not.\n\nIllness Benefit is not linked to your employer's policy on pay for sick leave .

You cannot get Illness Benefit on the days that you get SSP.\n\nIf your first illness in 2024 is less than 5 days and you qualify for Statutory Sick Pay, you don't need to apply for Illness Benefit. For illnesses lasting more than 5 days, Illness Benefit starts from day 6.\n\nExample 1:\n\nQ: What documents do I need to apply online for a driver's license in Ireland?\nA: You need a Public Services Card and verified MyGovID, proof of your address if your address is different to the one you provided when you got your Public Services Card, proof that you are normally resident in Ireland if you are not an EU or EEA citizen, a medical report form, dated within one month if required, and a Certificate of Professional Competence (CPC) for professional drivers.\n\nExample 2:\n\nQ: What criteria do I need to meet to qualify for unemployment benefits in Ireland?\nA: You must be under 66 years of age, or under 70 years and\u202fdeferring your State Pension (Contributory), be unemployed (you must be unemployed for at least 4 days out of 7), have had a substantial loss of employment and as a result be unemployed for at least 4 days out of 7 (this does not apply to casual workers and part-time fire fighters), be capable of work, be available for and genuinely seeking work, and have enough social insurance (PRSI) contributions.\n\nExample 3:\nQ: What if I get sick while on annual leave?\nA:\nIf you are sick during your annual leave and get a medical certificate for those days, they will not be counted as annual leave days. Your employer cannot insist you take annual leave on days you are off sick and have a medical certificate. You can continue to build up your annual leave entitlement while you are off sick, once you have a medical certificate.",

Stop after answering Example 3.\n\n\nExtracted documents:\nDocument 0:::\nRead more about leases on the website of Threshold, the national housing charity.\n\nPeriodic tenancy\n\nA periodic tenancy agreement does not specify a fixed length of time. The period of the tenancy may be weekly or monthly, depending on how often the rent is due. Periodic tenancy agreements may or may not be in writing.\n\nYour landlord can end the tenancy at any time during the first 6 months of the tenancy without having to give a reason, but, in general, you will get security of tenure after 6 months \u2013 see \u2018Part 4 tenancy\u2019 below. You must always get a valid written notice of termination and there are rules about how much notice you must be given, depending on the length of the tenancy (with some exceptions). Read more in our page If your landlord wants you to leave .\n\nAs a tenant, you can end the periodic tenancy at any time. You do not have to give a reason. Again, there are rules about notice periods and what constitutes a valid notice of termination \u2013 see \u2018Ending your tenancy\u2019 below.\n\nClaiming a Part 4 tenancy at the end of a fixed-term lease\n\nIf you have a fixed-term contract or lease and you want to remain in the property under a Part 4 tenancy, you should notify your landlord of your intention to stay in the property. You should do this between 3 months and 1 month before your fixed\u2013term tenancy or lease agreement expires.\n\nIf you do not notify your landlord, you cannot be refused coverage under Part 4, but you may have to compensate the landlord for any financial loss that they have because you did not notify them of your intention to remain in the tenancy.\n\nEnding your tenancy\n\nThe following section outlines what a tenant must do to end a tenancy. There are different rules for landlords who want to end a tenancy . The RTB also has information on their website about how a tenant can end a tenancy .\n\nFormat of termination notice\n\nAs a tenant, you can terminate your tenancy (whether fixed-term or periodic) without giving a reason, but you must give a valid notice of termination to your landlord. In order to be valid, this notice must:\n\nBe in writing\n\nBe signed by you\n\nSpecify the date that you are serving it on the landlord\n\nSpecify the termination date of the tenancy (you have the full 24 hours of this date to vacate possession)Document 1:::\nYou do not have security of tenure . This came in under the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2019 (pdf) .\n\nYou cannot be forced to pay for student-specific accommodation during the summer when you don\u2019t need it. Your tenancy or licence arrangement should not be more than 41 weeks, unless you ask for longer. If your landlord does not comply with the 41-week rule you should contact to the RTB, who can sanction your landlord. This rule came in under the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2024 and applies to tenancies and licence arrangements in student-specific accommodation created from 20 July 2024.\n\nYou only need to give your landlord 28 days\u2019 notice when ending a tenancy. You can give your landlord more notice if you want and your landlord must give you more. This came in under the Residential Tenancies (No. 2) Act 2021 .\n\nYou can terminate your fixed-term tenancy any time between 1 May and 1 October each year for any reason. But, outside of these dates, the existing rules about ending a fixed-term tenancy apply and you can only terminate your tenancy for specific reasons. This rule came in under the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2024 .\n\nFind out more about your rights as a tenant in student-specific accommodation on the RTB\u2019s website .\n\nSecurity of tenure\n\nSecurity of tenure is a tenant\u2019s right to stay in rented accommodation for a set amount of time. Generally, security of tenure applies automatically when you have been renting for 6 months and haven\u2019t received a valid notice of termination from your landlord in that time. When you have security of tenure, your landlord can only terminate your tenancy for a limited number of reasons, see our page \u2018 If your landlord wants you to leave \u2019.\n\nThe amount of time you are entitled to stay in rented accommodation after the first 6 months depends on when your tenancy began.\n\nIf your tenancy was created after 10 June 2022 , you have a tenancy of unlimited duration. This means if you have rented somewhere for 6 months, you have the right to stay in that accommodation indefinitely (no end date), unless the landlord wants to terminate your tenancy for one of the allowed reasons.\n\nExample 1:\n\nQ: What documents do I need to apply online for a driver's license in Ireland?\nA: You need a Public Services Card and verified MyGovID, proof of your address if your address is different to the one you provided when you got your Public Services Card, proof that you are normally resident in Ireland if you are not an EU or EEA citizen, a medical report form, dated within one month if required, and a Certificate of Professional Competence (CPC) for professional drivers.\n\nExample 2:\n\nQ: What criteria do I need to meet to qualify for unemployment benefits in Ireland?\nA: You must be under 66 years of age, or under 70 years and\u202fdeferring your State Pension (Contributory), be unemployed (you must be unemployed for at least 4 days out of 7), have had a substantial loss of employment and as a result be unemployed for at least 4 days out of 7 (this does not apply to casual workers and part-time fire fighters), be capable of work, be available for and genuinely seeking work, and have enough social insurance (PRSI) contributions.\n\nExample 3:\nQ: What is a valid reason for ending a tenancy after the first 6 months?\nA:\nAfter the first 6 months, a landlord can only terminate a tenancy for a limited number of reasons. These include:\n- Non-payment of rent\n- Breach of the terms of the tenancy agreement\n- Intention to sell or occupy the property themselves\n- Substantial refurbishment or renovation of the property\n- The tenant has been causing a nuisance or annoyance to other tenants or neighbours\n- The tenant has been using the property for illegal purposes\n- The tenant has been subletting the property without the landlord's permission\n- The tenant has been using the property for business purposes without the landlord's permission\n- The tenant has been causing damage to the property\n- The tenant has been using the property in a way that is not compatible with the purpose for which it was let\n- The tenant has been using the property in a way that is not compatible with the rights and reasonable expectations of other tenants or neighbours\n- The tenant has been using the property in a way that is not compatible with the rights and reasonable expectations of the landlord\n- The tenant has been using the property in a way that is not compatible with the terms of the tenancy agreement\n- The tenant has been using the property in a way that is not compatible with the Residential Tenancies Act 2004\n- The tenant has been using the property in a way that is not compatible with the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2019\n- The tenant has been using the property in a way that is not compatible with the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2024\n- The tenant has been using the property in a way that is not compatible with the Residential Tenancies (No. 2) Act 2021\n- The tenant has been using the property in a way that is not compatible with any other relevant legislation or regulations.",

There are different types of domestic adoption:\n\nStep-parent adoption\n\nStep-parent adoption is where you apply to adopt your partner\u2019s child.\n\nYour partner can consent (agree) to the adoption and still keep their own parental rights and responsibilities. In a step-parent adoption, you and your partner share parenting duties once the adoption order is made. Read about adoption orders in the section \u2018Steps involved in adopting a child\u2019, below.\n\nThe child must have lived with their parent and you (the prospective step- parent) together, for a minimum of 2 years .\n\nExtended family adoption\n\nAn extended family adoption is where a member of the child\u2019s family (or a relative), adopts the child.

If you adopt a child who is resident in Ireland, it is called domestic adoption .\n\nWhen you adopt a child, they become a member of your family. Adoption creates a legal relationship between the adoptive parents and the child.\n\nAs intercountry adoption is a complex legal process, you should get legal advice from a solicitor who specialises in intercountry adoption. See 'More information about intercountry adoption' below.\n\nWho can adopt?\n\nYou must be at least 21 years of age to adopt a child under Irish law.

If you commit a motoring offence , and the penalty for the offence includes penalty points, your driving licence will be endorsed with one or more penalty points.\n\nSome traffic offences have other penalties, such as fines as well as penalty points.\n\nThe penalty points system for driving offences has operated in Ireland since 2002. The law governing penalty points is the Road Traffic Act 2002 . This legislation has been amended a number of times to add offences for which penalty points can be issued.\n\nWhile penalty points are endorsed on your driving licence, the points do not physically appear on the licence. Your penalty points are recorded on your driving licence record, which is held on the National Vehicle and Driver File operated by the Department of Transport.\n\nPenalty point endorsements remain on your licence record for 3 years and must be notified to your insurance company when applying for motor insurance. Motor insurance companies have had access to the National Vehicle and Driver File since 2014.\n\nEndorsements on your licence record will often lead to an increase in your motor insurance premium.\n\nHow do penalty points work?\n\nPenalty points are recorded on your driving licence when:\n\nYou are convicted in court of a driving offence that attracts penalty points or\n\nYou pay a fixed charge notice that was issued to you for an offence that also carries penalty points\n\nIf you get 12 penalty points in any 3 year period, you are automatically disqualified from driving for 6 months.\n\nLearner permit drivers are disqualified if they have 7 penalty points. This lower threshold also applies for the first 2 years of a driver\u2019s first full driving licence.\n\nPenalty points are not added to your licence immediately.\n\nFixed charge and penalty offences\n\nFixed notice penalties are issued for driving offences that attract penalty points and/or just a fine.Document 1:::\nExamples of how penalty points and fines are awarded.\n\nSpeeding offences : A fixed charge fine of \u20ac160, together with 3 penalty points. If you have been caught speeding on a police traffic camera, you will get a notice of your fine and penalty points for the offence by post. You have 28 days in which to pay your fine from the date the notice is issued to you. If you do not pay your fine, the fine then increases to \u20ac240, which you must pay within 28 days. If after this time (56 days) you still have not paid your fine, the offence is referred to the courts. If you are convicted in court of speeding offences and non-payment of fines, you will automatically receive 5 penalty points and a fine up to a maximum of \u20ac1,000.\n\nSeatbelt offences : If you drive without a seatbelt or allow children under 17 years to travel in your car without a seatbelt, you will incur a fixed charge fine of \u20ac120. You must pay this fine within 28 days or face an increased fine of \u20ac180 payable within 56 days of the offence. 3 penalty points will be added to your licence if you pay the fine on time. If you are convicted in court for non-wearing of a seatbelt, 5 penalty points will be added to your licence and you will be liable to a \u20ac2,000 fine for a first offence. Read more about seatbelts and the law in Ireland .\n\nMotor insurance offences : If you drive without insurance, you will get 5 penalty points and will have to appear in court. The court can issue a fine of up to \u20ac5,000 and can send you to prison for up to 6 months. The court can disqualify you from driving instead of issuing penalty points.\n\nCareless driving : If you drive \u2018a vehicle in a public place without due care and attention' you can get up to 5 penalty points on your licence and a fine of up to \u20ac5,000. If careless driving causes death or serious bodily harm, you are liable on conviction on indictment to imprisonment for a term of up to 2 years or to a fine of up to \u20ac10,000 or to both.\n\nOther penalty point questions\n\nWhat happens if someone else was driving my vehicle?\n\nExample 1:\n\nQ: What documents do I need to apply online for a driver's license in Ireland?\nA: You need a Public Services Card and verified MyGovID, proof of your address if your address is different to the one you provided when you got your Public Services Card, proof that you are normally resident in Ireland if you are not an EU or EEA citizen, a medical report form, dated within one month if required, and a Certificate of Professional Competence (CPC) for professional drivers.\n\nExample 2:\n\nQ: What criteria do I need to meet to qualify for unemployment benefits in Ireland?\nA: You must be under 66 years of age, or under 70 years and\u202fdeferring your State Pension (Contributory), be unemployed (you must be unemployed for at least 4 days out of 7), have had a substantial loss of employment and as a result be unemployed for at least 4 days out of 7 (this does not apply to casual workers and part-time fire fighters), be capable of work, be available for and genuinely seeking work, and have enough social insurance (PRSI) contributions.\n\nExample 3:\nQ: How do penalty points work?\nA:\n\nPenalty points are recorded on your driving licence when you are convicted in court of a driving offence that attracts penalty points or you pay a fixed charge notice that was issued to you for an offence that also carries penalty points.\n\nIf you get 12 penalty points in any 3 year period, you are automatically disqualified from driving for 6 months.

It was replaced by the Work Placement Experience Programme (WPEP) .\n\nThis page can be used for reference purposes for information on the operation of the YESS up until it closed on 12 July 2021.\n\nThe Youth Employment Support Scheme (YESS) supported long-term unemployed young people back into the workplace. It started on 1 October 2018 and ended in July 2021.\n\nYESS aimed to give you the opportunity to learn basic work and social skills in a supportive environment, while on a work placement in a host organisation. You must have been aged 18\u201324, unemployed and getting a qualifying social welfare payment for at least 12 months \u2013 see 'Rules' below. If you were unemployed for less than 12 months, you must have faced a significant barrier to work to qualify.\n\nParticipation was voluntary. There was no financial penalties if you did not want to participate in the scheme or if you dropped out.\n\nThe scheme was open to host organisations in the private, community and voluntary sectors only. Public service bodies, including schools and colleges, could not host YESS placements.\n\nYESS was a scheme under the Irish Youth Guarantee . A previous placement scheme, First Steps , which was similar to YESS, finished on 30 March 2018. YESS is no longer available and was replaced by the Work Placement Experience Programme (WPEP) .\n\nWho was eligible for YESS?\n\nPeople aged between 18 and 24 and:\n\nHad been out of work and getting a qualifying payment (see below) for at least 12 months or\n\nFaced a significant barrier to work (if unemployed for less than 12 months)\n\nWhat were the qualifying payments?Document 1:::\nHad been out of work and getting a qualifying payment (see below) for at least 12 months or\n\nFaced a significant barrier to work (if unemployed for less than 12 months)\n\nWhat were the qualifying payments?\n\nYou must have been getting one of the following payments for at least 12 months: Jobseeker's Benefit , Jobseeker's Allowance , Jobseeker's Transitional payment , One-Parent Family Payment , Disability Allowance , Blind Person\u2019s Pension , or Supplementary Welfare Allowance .\n\nOther schemes that counted towards the qualifying period\n\nThe 12-month qualifying period could also have included time spent on schemes such as: SOLAS training apprenticeships , Youthreach , Back to Education Allowance , Fastrack to Information Technology and T\u00fas .\n\nHow did YESS work?\n\nThe DSP provided a case officer, who was in contact with you and your host organisation throughout your placement. The placement was monitored with monthly reporting to make sure that it continued to meet the scheme guidelines.\n\nTraining and development\n\nParticipants could get a Training Support Grant of up to \u20ac500 if needed. The grant was available up 2 times in a 12-month period. The grant was increased from \u20ac500 to \u20ac1,000 under the July Jobs Stimulus .\n\nDuration of scheme\n\nThe scheme lasted for 3 months, with the option to extend the placement to 6 months if the DSP agreed. Participants could spend a maximum of 6 months on a placement with the same host organisation.\n\nYou could be eligible to do 3 placements in total, up to a maximum period of 18 months (78 weeks).\n\nParticipants worked 24 hours per week over 3 days or 4 days.\n\nRates\n\nParticipants were paid a weekly YESS allowance of \u20ac229.20 by DSP. However, if their current social welfare payment was more than this allowance, they continued to receive their current social welfare payment plus a top-up of \u20ac22.50 per week.\n\n_Page edited: 8 February 2024 _\n\nRelated documents\n\nGarda Youth Diversion Programme\n\nThe aim of the Garda Youth Diversion Programme is to prevent young offenders in Ireland from entering into the full criminal justice system by offering them a second chance.\n\n1297.265\n\nWork Placement Experience Programme (WPEP)\n\nExample 1:\n\nQ: What documents do I need to apply online for a driver's license in Ireland?\nA: You need a Public Services Card and verified MyGovID, proof of your address if your address is different to the one you provided when you got your Public Services Card, proof that you are normally resident in Ireland if you are not an EU or EEA citizen, a medical report form, dated within one month if required, and a Certificate of Professional Competence (CPC) for professional drivers.\n\nExample 2:\n\nQ: What criteria do I need to meet to qualify for unemployment benefits in Ireland?\nA: You must be under 66 years of age, or under 70 years and\u202fdeferring your State Pension (Contributory), be unemployed (you must be unemployed for at least 4 days out of 7), have had a substantial loss of employment and as a result be unemployed for at least 4 days out of 7 (this does not apply to casual workers and part-time fire fighters), be capable of work, be available for and genuinely seeking work, and have enough social insurance (PRSI) contributions.\n\nExample 3:\nQ: Who was eligible for YESS (Youth Employment Support Scheme)?\nA:\n\n* People aged between 18 and 24\n* Had been out of work and getting a qualifying payment (see below) for at least 12 months or\n* Faced a significant barrier to work (if unemployed for less than 12 months)\n\nQualifying payments:\n\n* Jobseeker's Benefit\n* Jobseeker's Allowance\n* Jobseeker's Transitional payment\n* One-Parent Family Payment\n* Disability Allowance\n* Blind Person\u2019s Pension\n* Supplementary Welfare Allowance\n\nThe 12-month qualifying period could also have included time spent on schemes such as:\n\n* SOLAS training apprenticeships\n* Youthreach\n* Back to Education Allowance\n* Fastrack to Information Technology\n* T\u00fas",

This means that if you have a pre-nuptial agreement in place and you end up in court following the breakdown of your marriage, the judge is not bound by the terms of the pre-nuptial agreement. The only provision in Irish law is under sections 113 and 113A of the Succession Act 1965 (as amended) where a spouse or a civil partner can renounce his/her legal right share in a pre-nuptial agreement. Although they are not legally binding, there is nothing in Irish law which stops a couple planning to marry from having and signing a pre-nuptial agreement. Importantly, such agreements can serve as guides for the courts in judicial separation and divorce cases. If a pre-nuptial agreement makes \u2018proper provision\u2019 for each person it is more likely to be persuasive on the judge. Therefore, in situations where one party is likely to inherit a significant family farm or business, it will guide the judge in the divorce or judicial separation on what the parties\u2019 intentions were at the outset.",

As a result, they are not strictly binding. This means that if you have a pre-nuptial agreement in place and you end up in court following the breakdown of your marriage, the judge is not bound by the terms of the pre-nuptial agreement.\n\nThe only provision in Irish law is under sections 113 and 113A of the Succession Act 1965 (as amended) where a spouse or a civil partner can renounce his/her legal right share in a pre-nuptial agreement.\n\nAlthough they are not legally binding, there is nothing in Irish law which stops a couple planning to marry from having and signing a pre-nuptial agreement. Importantly, such agreements can serve as guides for the courts in judicial separation and divorce cases. If a pre-nuptial agreement makes \u2018proper provision\u2019 for each person it is more likely to be persuasive on the judge. Therefore, in situations where one party is likely to inherit a significant family farm or business, it will guide the judge in the divorce or judicial separation on what the parties\u2019 intentions were at the outset.\n\nDrafting a pre-nuptial agreement\n\nOnly pre-nuptial agreements entered into following independent legal advice for both parties are likely to be taken into account. The court would have to be satisfied that there had been a complete disclosure of assets before the agreement was signed. It is also advisable for the agreement to provide for reviews:\n\nPeriodically (for example, every five years)\n\nIf children are born\n\nIf there is a major change in circumstances (for example, assets are purchased or sold)\n\nThe agreement should be in writing, be signed by each party and comply with the rules of contract law.\n\nThe future of pre-nuptial agreementsDocument 1:::\nYou must notify the personal representative of the deceased of your application for provision from the deceased\u2019s estate within 6 months of an application for a grant of probate .\n\nIn general, if your cohabiting relationship ended two years or more before your ex-partner died, you cannot apply for provision from the estate unless you were getting regular or periodic payments from the deceased.\n\nWhat is a cohabitation agreement?\n\nIf you live with your partner but you do not intend to marry, you should protect your financial interests by entering into a \u2018 cohabitation agreement \u2019 (also called a cohabitant\u2019s agreement). This is a voluntary, signed agreement, which allows you to specify the day-to-day joint financial arrangements of your relationship, such as:\n\nThe payment of joint debts\n\nThe payment of common household expenses\n\nYou can also specify how you plan to separate your assets, such as shared property, should the relationship come to an end. In the event of a break-up, a cohabitation agreement can make the division of your assets more straightforward.\n\nYour cohabitation agreement may include a provision that the redress scheme does not apply to you (for example, you can both agree not to apply for a maintenance order should your relationship end). This is different from similar agreements by married couples. Agreements between married couples cannot exclude either party\u2019s right to apply to the courts for various orders (for example, a maintenance order).\n\nIs a cohabitation agreement valid in court?\n\nIf you and your partner make a cohabitation agreement (an agreement on joint financial matters), it is only valid if:\n\nEach of you has had independent legal advice, or you got legal advice together and have waived the right to independent legal advice (see \u2018More information\u2019 below)\n\nThe agreement is a contract\n\nThe agreement has been signed by each of you\n\nIn exceptional circumstances, the court may set aside or vary (change) your cohabitation agreement (for example, if the enforcement of the agreement would cause serious injustice).\n\nIf you and your cohabitant entered into an agreement before the 2010 Act commenced, it is enforceable.\n\nMore information\n\nIf you are concerned about your rights following the breakdown of your cohabiting relationship, you should get legal advice.\n\nExample 1:\n\nQ: What documents do I need to apply online for a driver's license in Ireland?\nA: You need a Public Services Card and verified MyGovID, proof of your address if your address is different to the one you provided when you got your Public Services Card, proof that you are normally resident in Ireland if you are not an EU or EEA citizen, a medical report form, dated within one month if required, and a Certificate of Professional Competence (CPC) for professional drivers.\n\nExample 2:\n\nQ: What criteria do I need to meet to qualify for unemployment benefits in Ireland?\nA: You must be under 66 years of age, or under 70 years and\u202fdeferring your State Pension (Contributory), be unemployed (you must be unemployed for at least 4 days out of 7), have had a substantial loss of employment and as a result be unemployed for at least 4 days out of 7 (this does not apply to casual workers and part-time fire fighters), be capable of work, be available for and genuinely seeking work, and have enough social insurance (PRSI) contributions.\n\nExample 3:\nQ: What is the legal status of pre-nuptial agreements?\nA:\nPre-nuptial agreements have no basis in law in Ireland. As a result, they are not strictly binding. This means that if you have a pre-nuptial agreement in place and you end up in court following the breakdown of your marriage, the judge is not bound by the terms of the pre-nuptial agreement.\n\nThe only provision in Irish law is under sections 113 and 113A of the Succession Act 1965 (as amended) where a spouse or a civil partner can renounce his/her legal right share in a pre-nuptial agreement.\n\nAlthough they are not legally binding, there is nothing in Irish law which stops a couple planning to marry from having and signing a pre-nuptial agreement.
