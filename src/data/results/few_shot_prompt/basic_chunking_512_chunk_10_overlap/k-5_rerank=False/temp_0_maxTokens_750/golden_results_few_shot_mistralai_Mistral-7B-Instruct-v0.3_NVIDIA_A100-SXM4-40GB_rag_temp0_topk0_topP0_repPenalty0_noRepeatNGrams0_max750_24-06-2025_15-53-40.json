Before 1 January 2005, everyone born on the island of Ireland was an Irish citizen by birth.

Instead, it said that this would be set out in law.Document 1:::\nThe Good Friday Agreement , which was signed between the Irish and British governments in 1998, confirmed that people born in Northern Ireland could choose to be either British or Irish citizens.\n\nSince 1 January 2005, if you are born in Northern Ireland, you can claim Irish citizenship if your parent (or parents) are either British or Irish citizens, or one of them has lived on the island of Ireland for at least 3 out of the 4 years immediately before your birth.\n\nYou can read more about citizenship by birth or descent .\n\nWho is entitled to Irish citizenship?\n\nYou are entitled to claim Irish citizenship if any one of the following applies:\n\n1.

This means you can get 2 weeks off in a row.\n\nHoliday pay\n\nHoliday pay (pay for annual leave) must be paid in advance at your normal weekly rate .\n\nIf your pay changes from week-to-week (for example, because of commission or bonus payments), your holiday pay is the average of your pay over the 13 weeks before you take holidays.\n\nPart-time employees\n\nGenerally, annual leave for part-time workers is calculated using Method 3 above. This means you can get 8% of your hours worked.\n\nIf you work full time for some months and part-time for the rest of the year, you should calculate the leave for the full-time and the part-time periods of work separately.\n\nAgency employees\n\nIf you are an agency worker, the party who pays your wages (employment agency or client company) is the employer for the purposes of the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997 , and is responsible for providing your annual leave entitlement.\n\nCan my employer force me to take annual leave?\n\nUsually, employees can ask to take annual leave at specific times.

Depending on your employer, you can agree to take your annual leave within 6 months of the relevant leave year.Document 1:::\nCan I share my unpaid parental leave with my partner?\n\nBoth parents have an equal, separate entitlement to parental leave. This means you are both entitled to 26 weeks leave.\n\nIf you both work for the same employer and your employer agrees, you can transfer 14 weeks of your parental leave entitlement to the other parent.\n\nWhat happens if I change jobs before taking all my leave?\n\nIf you change job and have used part of your parental leave allowance, you can use the remainder of your allowance after one year's employment with your new employer (once your child is still under 12).\n\nProtection of your employment rights\n\nYour employment rights are protected during parental leave. In general, you are treated as being in employments while you are on parental leave.\n\nThe only exception to this is your right to pay or superannuation (pension contributions) from your employer while you are on parental leave.\n\nPublic holidays and annual leave\n\nYou can continue to build up annual leave while on parental leave. If your holidays fall during parental leave, they may be taken at a later time.\n\nYou are entitled to any public holidays that occur while you are on parental leave.

During the illness, you are treated as an employee who is sick .\n\nWhat happens to my social insurance contributions?\n\nYou can get credited PRSI contributions while you are taking parental leave. Credited PRSI contributions can protect your social insurance record and your entitlement to benefits in the future.\n\nYour employer must write to the Client Eligibility Services section of Department of Social Protection (DSP), setting out the weeks you have not worked, so that you can get credited PRSI contributions for this time.\n\nCan my employer refuse my request for parental leave?\n\nYour employer can only refuse parental leave if you are not entitled to take it.\n\nCan my employer postpone my parental leave?\n\nYour employer can postpone your parental leave for up to 6 months. They must do this before signing the confirmation document. After that, your leave cannot be postponed without further written agreement.\n\nExample 1:\n\nQ: What documents do I need to apply online for a driver's license in Ireland?\nA: You need a Public Services Card and verified MyGovID, proof of your address if your address is different to the one you provided when you got your Public Services Card, proof that you are normally resident in Ireland if you are not an EU or EEA citizen, a medical report form, dated within one month if required, and a Certificate of Professional Competence (CPC) for professional drivers.\n\nExample 2:\n\nQ: What criteria do I need to meet to qualify for unemployment benefits in Ireland?\nA: You must be under 66 years of age, or under 70 years and\u202fdeferring your State Pension (Contributory), be unemployed (you must be unemployed for at least 4 days out of 7), have had a substantial loss of employment and as a result be unemployed for at least 4 days out of 7 (this does not apply to casual workers and part-time fire fighters), be capable of work, be available for and genuinely seeking work, and have enough social insurance (PRSI) contributions.\n\nExample 3:\nQ: Can my employer force me to take annual leave?\nA:\nUsually, employees can ask to take annual leave at specific times.

This will only be done with your consent\n\nThis requirement is in place since 6 July 2022, when it was brought in under the Regulation of Providers of Building Works and Miscellaneous Provisions Act 2022.\n\nThe RTB's website has more information about these changes .\n\nWhat is a valid notice of termination?\n\nThe law sets out the requirements for a valid notice of termination. It must:\n\nBe in writing (an email is not sufficient)\n\nBe signed by the landlord (or an authorised agent)\n\nSpecify the date of termination of the tenancy\n\nState that you have the whole 24 hours of the termination date to vacate the property\n\nSpecify the date of the notice itself\n\nState the reason for termination, if a tenancy has lasted more than 6 months or is a fixed-term tenancy. (This does not have to be included for tenancies in student-specific accommodation.)\n\nState that any issue about the validity of the notice or the right of the landlord to serve it must be referred to the RTB within 90 days from the receipt of the notice. (This 90-day timeframe applies unless the tenant is in breach of their obligations.)\n\nYour landlord must give additional details in certain situations and, in some cases, a statutory declaration. The information below describes the additional details needed for each of the valid reasons for terminating your tenancy. The RTB also provides sample notices of termination , with the details required in each situation.\n\nIf the property is being sold\n\nIf your landlord intends to sell the property within 9 months of the terminating your tenancy, the notice of termination must state that:\n\n\u201cThe reason for the termination of the tenancy is due to the fact that the landlord intends to sell the dwelling, for full consideration, within 9 months after the termination of the tenancy\u201d.Document 1:::\nYou do not have security of tenure .

Your tenancy or licence arrangement should not be more than 41 weeks, unless you ask for longer. If your landlord does not comply with the 41-week rule you should contact to the RTB, who can sanction your landlord. This rule came in under the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2024 and applies to tenancies and licence arrangements in student-specific accommodation created from 20 July 2024.\n\nYou only need to give your landlord 28 days\u2019 notice when ending a tenancy. You can give your landlord more notice if you want and your landlord must give you more. This came in under the Residential Tenancies (No. 2) Act 2021 .\n\nYou can terminate your fixed-term tenancy any time between 1 May and 1 October each year for any reason. But, outside of these dates, the existing rules about ending a fixed-term tenancy apply and you can only terminate your tenancy for specific reasons. This rule came in under the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2024 .\n\nFind out more about your rights as a tenant in student-specific accommodation on the RTB\u2019s website .\n\nSecurity of tenure\n\nSecurity of tenure is a tenant\u2019s right to stay in rented accommodation for a set amount of time. Generally, security of tenure applies automatically when you have been renting for 6 months and haven\u2019t received a valid notice of termination from your landlord in that time. When you have security of tenure, your landlord can only terminate your tenancy for a limited number of reasons, see our page \u2018 If your landlord wants you to leave \u2019.\n\nThe amount of time you are entitled to stay in rented accommodation after the first 6 months depends on when your tenancy began.\n\nIf your tenancy was created after 10 June 2022 , you have a tenancy of unlimited duration. This means if you have rented somewhere for 6 months, you have the right to stay in that accommodation indefinitely (no end date), unless the landlord wants to terminate your tenancy for one of the allowed reasons.\n\nExample 1:\n\nQ: What documents do I need to apply online for a driver's license in Ireland?\nA: You need a Public Services Card and verified MyGovID, proof of your address if your address is different to the one you provided when you got your Public Services Card, proof that you are normally resident in Ireland if you are not an EU or EEA citizen, a medical report form, dated within one month if required, and a Certificate of Professional Competence (CPC) for professional drivers.\n\nExample 2:\n\nQ: What criteria do I need to meet to qualify for unemployment benefits in Ireland?\nA: You must be under 66 years of age, or under 70 years and\u202fdeferring your State Pension (Contributory), be unemployed (you must be unemployed for at least 4 days out of 7), have had a substantial loss of employment and as a result be unemployed for at least 4 days out of 7 (this does not apply to casual workers and part-time fire fighters), be capable of work, be available for and genuinely seeking work, and have enough social insurance (PRSI) contributions.\n\nExample 3:\nQ: What is a valid reason for ending a tenancy after the first 6 months?\nA:\nA valid reason for ending a tenancy after the first 6 months is that the landlord intends to sell the property within 9 months of the termination of the tenancy.

There are different types of domestic adoption, for example, step-parent adoption and long-term foster care adoption .\n\nThis page explains the different types of domestic adoption, the steps involved in the adoption process, and the rules about who can adopt a child in Ireland.\n\nYou may also want to read our page about intercountry adoption , which is where you adopt a child from abroad.\n\nTypes of domestic adoption\n\nDomestic adoption is when you adopt a child who is resident in Ireland. There are different types of domestic adoption:\n\nStep-parent adoption\n\nStep-parent adoption is where you apply to adopt your partner\u2019s child.\n\nYour partner can consent (agree) to the adoption and still keep their own parental rights and responsibilities. In a step-parent adoption, you and your partner share parenting duties once the adoption order is made. Read about adoption orders in the section \u2018Steps involved in adopting a child\u2019, below.\n\nThe child must have lived with their parent and you (the prospective step- parent) together, for a minimum of 2 years .\n\nExtended family adoption\n\nAn extended family adoption is where a member of the child\u2019s family (or a relative), adopts the child. The child would have been placed with them by the birth mother or by the Tusla childcare system.\n\nDomestic infant adoption\n\nDomestic infant adoption is where a child is placed with an alternative set of parents. The child is placed with the couple by the Tusla adoption service or an accredited adoption agency. The Adoption Authority of Ireland must approve the placement before it takes place.\n\nLong term foster care adoption\n\nFoster care adoption is when a couple adopt a child who was originally placed with them in a foster care situation.\n\nFind more information on the different types of domestic adoption on the Adoption Authority of Ireland\u2019s website.\n\nWho can adopt a child in Ireland?Document 1:::\nEnglish | Gaeilge\n\nYou are here: Home > Family and Relationships > Adoption, fostering and surrogacy > Intercountry adoption\n\nIntercountry adoption\n\nWhat is intercountry adoption?\n\nWho can adopt?\n\nBeing assessed for eligibility to adopt\n\nChoosing a country to adopt from\n\nThe process of intercountry adoption\n\nGetting immigration clearance for the child\n\nSteps to take once the child arrives in Ireland\n\nMore information about intercountry adoption\n\nWhat is intercountry adoption?\n\nIf you adopt a child who lives in a country outside Ireland, the process is called intercountry adoption. If you adopt a child who is resident in Ireland, it is called domestic adoption .\n\nWhen you adopt a child, they become a member of your family.

Local authorities must begin work on a new development plan 4 years after the start date of the last plan.\n\nThe Planning and Development Bill 2023 intends to extend the life of development plans from 6 years to 10 years, with a review after 5 years. This suggested timeframe will line-up with when Census data is available to allow for a more strategic approach to planning. The Planning and Development Bill needs to be passed for this change to come in.\n\nDo national plans influence local development plans?\n\nLocal development plans must be compatible with national and regional planning strategies, including:\n\nThe National Planning Framework , which sets out the national strategy for developments.\n\nThe Regional Spatial and Economic Strategies, which detail plans for the 3 regional areas in Ireland\n\nThe National Climate Action Plan , which sets out how we will meet our greenhouse gas emission targets\n\nEach development plan is examined by the Office of the Planning Regulator to ensure that it does not go against any national or regional strategies.\n\nDevelopment plans must also have an environmental report that highlights any significant environmental effect the plan may have.\n\nCan I give feedback about a development plan?\n\nYes. Local authorities look for feedback from the public when they are working on a new development plan.\n\nWhen can I give feedback about a development plan?\n\nWhen a new development plan is being prepared, your local authority will inform the public that they intend to review the plan. They will do this using:\n\nLocal or national media\n\nSocial media\n\nOther web-based channels\n\nYou can make observations, submissions and suggestions for the development plan at this time.\n\nExample 1:\n\nQ: What documents do I need to apply online for a driver's license in Ireland?\nA: You need a Public Services Card and verified MyGovID, proof of your address if your address is different to the one you provided when you got your Public Services Card, proof that you are normally resident in Ireland if you are not an EU or EEA citizen, a medical report form, dated within one month if required, and a Certificate of Professional Competence (CPC) for professional drivers.\n\nExample 2:\n\nQ: What criteria do I need to meet to qualify for unemployment benefits in Ireland?\nA: You must be under 66 years of age, or under 70 years and\u202fdeferring your State Pension (Contributory), be unemployed (you must be unemployed for at least 4 days out of 7), have had a substantial loss of employment and as a result be unemployed for at least 4 days out of 7 (this does not apply to casual workers and part-time fire fighters), be capable of work, be available for and genuinely seeking work, and have enough social insurance (PRSI) contributions.\n\nExample 3:\nQ: How can I comment on a planning application?\nA:\n\nYou must make comments about planning applications in writing to the local authority where the application was made.

It was replaced by the Work Placement Experience Programme (WPEP) .\n\nThis page can be used for reference purposes for information on the operation of the YESS up until it closed on 12 July 2021.\n\nThe Youth Employment Support Scheme (YESS) supported long-term unemployed young people back into the workplace. It started on 1 October 2018 and ended in July 2021.\n\nYESS aimed to give you the opportunity to learn basic work and social skills in a supportive environment, while on a work placement in a host organisation. You must have been aged 18\u201324, unemployed and getting a qualifying social welfare payment for at least 12 months \u2013 see 'Rules' below. If you were unemployed for less than 12 months, you must have faced a significant barrier to work to qualify.\n\nParticipation was voluntary. There was no financial penalties if you did not want to participate in the scheme or if you dropped out.\n\nThe scheme was open to host organisations in the private, community and voluntary sectors only. Public service bodies, including schools and colleges, could not host YESS placements.\n\nYESS was a scheme under the Irish Youth Guarantee . A previous placement scheme, First Steps , which was similar to YESS, finished on 30 March 2018. YESS is no longer available and was replaced by the Work Placement Experience Programme (WPEP) .\n\nWho was eligible for YESS?\n\nPeople aged between 18 and 24 and:\n\nHad been out of work and getting a qualifying payment (see below) for at least 12 months or\n\nFaced a significant barrier to work (if unemployed for less than 12 months)\n\nWhat were the qualifying payments?Document 1:::\nHad been out of work and getting a qualifying payment (see below) for at least 12 months or\n\nFaced a significant barrier to work (if unemployed for less than 12 months)\n\nWhat were the qualifying payments?\n\nYou must have been getting one of the following payments for at least 12 months: Jobseeker's Benefit , Jobseeker's Allowance , Jobseeker's Transitional payment , One-Parent Family Payment , Disability Allowance , Blind Person\u2019s Pension , or Supplementary Welfare Allowance .\n\nOther schemes that counted towards the qualifying period\n\nThe 12-month qualifying period could also have included time spent on schemes such as: SOLAS training apprenticeships , Youthreach , Back to Education Allowance , Fastrack to Information Technology and T\u00fas .\n\nHow did YESS work?\n\nThe DSP provided a case officer, who was in contact with you and your host organisation throughout your placement. The placement was monitored with monthly reporting to make sure that it continued to meet the scheme guidelines.\n\nTraining and development\n\nParticipants could get a Training Support Grant of up to \u20ac500 if needed. The grant was available up 2 times in a 12-month period. The grant was increased from \u20ac500 to \u20ac1,000 under the July Jobs Stimulus .\n\nDuration of scheme\n\nThe scheme lasted for 3 months, with the option to extend the placement to 6 months if the DSP agreed. Participants could spend a maximum of 6 months on a placement with the same host organisation.\n\nYou could be eligible to do 3 placements in total, up to a maximum period of 18 months (78 weeks).\n\nParticipants worked 24 hours per week over 3 days or 4 days.\n\nRates\n\nParticipants were paid a weekly YESS allowance of \u20ac229.20 by DSP. However, if their current social welfare payment was more than this allowance, they continued to receive their current social welfare payment plus a top-up of \u20ac22.50 per week.\n\n_Page edited: 8 February 2024 _\n\nRelated documents\n\nGarda Youth Diversion Programme\n\nThe aim of the Garda Youth Diversion Programme is to prevent young offenders in Ireland from entering into the full criminal justice system by offering them a second chance.\n\n1297.265\n\nWork Placement Experience Programme (WPEP)\n\nExample 1:\n\nQ: What documents do I need to apply online for a driver's license in Ireland?\nA: You need a Public Services Card and verified MyGovID, proof of your address if your address is different to the one you provided when you got your Public Services Card, proof that you are normally resident in Ireland if you are not an EU or EEA citizen, a medical report form, dated within one month if required, and a Certificate of Professional Competence (CPC) for professional drivers.\n\nExample 2:\n\nQ: What criteria do I need to meet to qualify for unemployment benefits in Ireland?\nA: You must be under 66 years of age, or under 70 years and\u202fdeferring your State Pension (Contributory), be unemployed (you must be unemployed for at least 4 days out of 7), have had a substantial loss of employment and as a result be unemployed for at least 4 days out of 7 (this does not apply to casual workers and part-time fire fighters), be capable of work, be available for and genuinely seeking work, and have enough social insurance (PRSI) contributions.\n\nExample 3:\nQ: Who was eligible for YESS (Youth Employment Support Scheme)?\nA:\n\n* People aged between 18 and 24\n* Had been out of work and getting a qualifying payment (see below) for at least 12 months or\n* Faced a significant barrier to work (if unemployed for less than 12 months)\n\nQualifying payments:\n\n* Jobseeker's Benefit\n* Jobseeker's Allowance\n* Jobseeker's Transitional payment\n* One-Parent Family Payment\n* Disability Allowance\n* Blind Person\u2019s Pension\n* Supplementary Welfare Allowance\n\nThe 12-month qualifying period could also have included time spent on schemes such as:\n\n* SOLAS training apprenticeships\n* Youthreach\n* Back to Education Allowance\n* Fastrack to Information Technology\n* T\u00fas",

As a result, they are not strictly binding. This means that if you have a pre-nuptial agreement in place and you end up in court following the breakdown of your marriage, the judge is not bound by the terms of the pre-nuptial agreement.\n\nThe only provision in Irish law is under sections 113 and 113A of the Succession Act 1965 (as amended) where a spouse or a civil partner can renounce his/her legal right share in a pre-nuptial agreement.\n\nAlthough they are not legally binding, there is nothing in Irish law which stops a couple planning to marry from having and signing a pre-nuptial agreement.

Therefore, in situations where one party is likely to inherit a significant family farm or business, it will guide the judge in the divorce or judicial separation on what the parties\u2019 intentions were at the outset.\n\nDrafting a pre-nuptial agreement\n\nOnly pre-nuptial agreements entered into following independent legal advice for both parties are likely to be taken into account. The court would have to be satisfied that there had been a complete disclosure of assets before the agreement was signed. It is also advisable for the agreement to provide for reviews:\n\nPeriodically (for example, every five years)\n\nIf children are born\n\nIf there is a major change in circumstances (for example, assets are purchased or sold)\n\nThe agreement should be in writing, be signed by each party and comply with the rules of contract law.\n\nThe future of pre-nuptial agreementsDocument 1:::\nYou must notify the personal representative of the deceased of your application for provision from the deceased\u2019s estate within 6 months of an application for a grant of probate .\n\nIn general, if your cohabiting relationship ended two years or more before your ex-partner died, you cannot apply for provision from the estate unless you were getting regular or periodic payments from the deceased.\n\nWhat is a cohabitation agreement?\n\nIf you live with your partner but you do not intend to marry, you should protect your financial interests by entering into a \u2018 cohabitation agreement \u2019 (also called a cohabitant\u2019s agreement). This is a voluntary, signed agreement, which allows you to specify the day-to-day joint financial arrangements of your relationship, such as:\n\nThe payment of joint debts\n\nThe payment of common household expenses\n\nYou can also specify how you plan to separate your assets, such as shared property, should the relationship come to an end. In the event of a break-up, a cohabitation agreement can make the division of your assets more straightforward.\n\nYour cohabitation agreement may include a provision that the redress scheme does not apply to you (for example, you can both agree not to apply for a maintenance order should your relationship end). This is different from similar agreements by married couples. Agreements between married couples cannot exclude either party\u2019s right to apply to the courts for various orders (for example, a maintenance order).\n\nIs a cohabitation agreement valid in court?\n\nIf you and your partner make a cohabitation agreement (an agreement on joint financial matters), it is only valid if:\n\nEach of you has had independent legal advice, or you got legal advice together and have waived the right to independent legal advice (see \u2018More information\u2019 below)\n\nThe agreement is a contract\n\nThe agreement has been signed by each of you\n\nIn exceptional circumstances, the court may set aside or vary (change) your cohabitation agreement (for example, if the enforcement of the agreement would cause serious injustice).\n\nIf you and your cohabitant entered into an agreement before the 2010 Act commenced, it is enforceable.\n\nMore information\n\nIf you are concerned about your rights following the breakdown of your cohabiting relationship, you should get legal advice.\n\nExample 1:\n\nQ: What documents do I need to apply online for a driver's license in Ireland?\nA: You need a Public Services Card and verified MyGovID, proof of your address if your address is different to the one you provided when you got your Public Services Card, proof that you are normally resident in Ireland if you are not an EU or EEA citizen, a medical report form, dated within one month if required, and a Certificate of Professional Competence (CPC) for professional drivers.\n\nExample 2:\n\nQ: What criteria do I need to meet to qualify for unemployment benefits in Ireland?\nA: You must be under 66 years of age, or under 70 years and\u202fdeferring your State Pension (Contributory), be unemployed (you must be unemployed for at least 4 days out of 7), have had a substantial loss of employment and as a result be unemployed for at least 4 days out of 7 (this does not apply to casual workers and part-time fire fighters), be capable of work, be available for and genuinely seeking work, and have enough social insurance (PRSI) contributions.\n\nExample 3:\nQ: What is the legal status of pre-nuptial agreements?\nA:\nPre-nuptial agreements have no basis in law in Ireland.
