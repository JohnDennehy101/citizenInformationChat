However, you may have grounds (reasons) for complaint if you were unfairly selected for redundancy , or if you feel there was no genuine need for redundancy.\n\nUnless your employer can prove there was a genuine redundancy situation and that they followed fair procedures , your dismissal may be considered \u2018unfair\u2019.\n\nExample 1:\n\nQ: What documents do I need to apply online for a driver's license in Ireland?\nA: You need a Public Services Card and verified MyGovID, proof of your address if your address is different to the one you provided when you got your Public Services Card, proof that you are normally resident in Ireland if you are not an EU or EEA citizen, a medical report form, dated within one month if required, and a Certificate of Professional Competence (CPC) for professional drivers.\n\nExample 2:\n\nQ: What criteria do I need to meet to qualify for unemployment benefits in Ireland?\nA: You must be under 66 years of age, or under 70 years and\u202fdeferring your State Pension (Contributory), be unemployed (you must be unemployed for at least 4 days out of 7), have had a substantial loss of employment and as a result be unemployed for at least 4 days out of 7 (this does not apply to casual workers and part-time fire fighters), be capable of work, be available for and genuinely seeking work, and have enough social insurance (PRSI) contributions.\n\nExample 3:\nQ: What counts as genuine redundancy?\nA:\n\n* Financial difficulties within the business\n* Lack of work\n* Reorganisation within the business\n* Business closure\n\n* Your employer has a real business reason to make you redundant.",

Stop after answering Example 3.\n\n\nExtracted documents:\nDocument 0:::\nHoliday pay\n\nHoliday pay (pay for annual leave) must be paid in advance at your normal weekly rate .\n\nIf your pay changes from week-to-week (for example, because of commission or bonus payments), your holiday pay is the average of your pay over the 13 weeks before you take holidays.\n\nPart-time employees\n\nGenerally, annual leave for part-time workers is calculated using Method 3 above. This means you can get 8% of your hours worked.\n\nIf you work full time for some months and part-time for the rest of the year, you should calculate the leave for the full-time and the part-time periods of work separately.\n\nAgency employees\n\nIf you are an agency worker, the party who pays your wages (employment agency or client company) is the employer for the purposes of the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997 , and is responsible for providing your annual leave entitlement.\n\nCan my employer force me to take annual leave?\n\nUsually, employees can ask to take annual leave at specific times.

Depending on your employer, you can agree to take your annual leave within 6 months of the relevant leave year.\n\nAny further carrying-over (also called holding over ) of annual leave would need to be agreed between you and your employer.\n\nAnnual leave and sick leave\n\nWhat if I get sick while on annual leave?\n\nIf you are sick while you are on annual leave, you should get a medical certificate from your GP (doctor) as soon as possible to cover the days you were sick. Give the medical certificate to your employer as soon as you return to work.\n\nThis way, the sick days will not count as annual leave, and you can take your annual leave at a later date. Your employer cannot make you to take annual leave for time you were on certified sick leave.Document 2:::\nLeaving your job, layoff, and short-time working\n\nIn general, your annual leave is calculated on the basis of hours worked. This is set out in the Organisation of Working Time Act, 1997 .\n\nLeaving your job\n\nIf you are leaving a job without taking all the annual leave you are entitled to, your employer must pay you for the days you have not taken.\n\nLay off or short-time working\n\nDuring lay off or short-time working , you are still an employee of the company and your contract of employment remains valid.\n\nYou do not build up annual leave during lay off, but you are entitled to take annual leave that you built up before being laid off.\n\nMaking a complaint\n\nIf you think your holiday entitlement is wrong, try speaking informally to your employer.\n\nIf you cannot resolve the problem informally, you can complain to the Workplace Relations Commission.\n\nYou should apply using the WRC\u2019s online complaint form . You must make your complaint within 6 months of the dispute (disagreement) happening.\n\nThe time limit may be extended for a further 6 months, but only if you have a \u2018reasonable cause\u2019 which prevented you bringing your complaint within the normal time limit.\n\nExample 1:\n\nQ: What documents do I need to apply online for a driver's license in Ireland?\nA: You need a Public Services Card and verified MyGovID, proof of your address if your address is different to the one you provided when you got your Public Services Card, proof that you are normally resident in Ireland if you are not an EU or EEA citizen, a medical report form, dated within one month if required, and a Certificate of Professional Competence (CPC) for professional drivers.\n\nExample 2:\n\nQ: What criteria do I need to meet to qualify for unemployment benefits in Ireland?\nA: You must be under 66 years of age, or under 70 years and\u202fdeferring your State Pension (Contributory), be unemployed (you must be unemployed for at least 4 days out of 7), have had a substantial loss of employment and as a result be unemployed for at least 4 days out of 7 (this does not apply to casual workers and part-time fire fighters), be capable of work, be available for and genuinely seeking work, and have enough social insurance (PRSI) contributions.\n\nExample 3:\nQ: Can my employer force me to take annual leave?\nA:\nUsually, employees can ask to take annual leave at specific times.

If you commit a motoring offence , and the penalty for the offence includes penalty points, your driving licence will be endorsed with one or more penalty points.\n\nSome traffic offences have other penalties, such as fines as well as penalty points.\n\nThe penalty points system for driving offences has operated in Ireland since 2002. The law governing penalty points is the Road Traffic Act 2002 . This legislation has been amended a number of times to add offences for which penalty points can be issued.Document 1:::\nWhat motoring offences result in penalty points?\n\nThe Road Traffic Act 2002, (as amended) legislates for motoring offences that incur penalty points. The Road Safety Authority maintains an up-to-date list of penalty point motoring offences.\n\nExamples of how penalty points and fines are awarded.\n\nSpeeding offences : A fixed charge fine of \u20ac160, together with 3 penalty points. If you have been caught speeding on a police traffic camera, you will get a notice of your fine and penalty points for the offence by post. You have 28 days in which to pay your fine from the date the notice is issued to you. If you do not pay your fine, the fine then increases to \u20ac240, which you must pay within 28 days. If after this time (56 days) you still have not paid your fine, the offence is referred to the courts. If you are convicted in court of speeding offences and non-payment of fines, you will automatically receive 5 penalty points and a fine up to a maximum of \u20ac1,000.Document 2:::\nYou can read more about different types of driving offences and their associated penalties .

If you commit a motoring offence, and the penalty for the offence includes penalty points, your driving licence will be endorsed with one or more penalty points. Some traffic offences have other penalties, such as fines as well as penalty points. The penalty points system for driving offences has operated in Ireland since 2002. The law governing penalty points is the Road Traffic Act 2002. This legislation has been amended a number of times to add offences for which penalty points can be issued.",

As a result, they are not strictly binding. This means that if you have a pre-nuptial agreement in place and you end up in court following the breakdown of your marriage, the judge is not bound by the terms of the pre-nuptial agreement.\n\nThe only provision in Irish law is under sections 113 and 113A of the Succession Act 1965 (as amended) where a spouse or a civil partner can renounce his/her legal right share in a pre-nuptial agreement.Document 1:::\nAlthough they are not legally binding, there is nothing in Irish law which stops a couple planning to marry from having and signing a pre-nuptial agreement.

Therefore, in situations where one party is likely to inherit a significant family farm or business, it will guide the judge in the divorce or judicial separation on what the parties\u2019 intentions were at the outset.\n\nDrafting a pre-nuptial agreement\n\nOnly pre-nuptial agreements entered into following independent legal advice for both parties are likely to be taken into account. The court would have to be satisfied that there had been a complete disclosure of assets before the agreement was signed. It is also advisable for the agreement to provide for reviews:\n\nPeriodically (for example, every five years)\n\nIf children are born\n\nIf there is a major change in circumstances (for example, assets are purchased or sold)\n\nThe agreement should be in writing, be signed by each party and comply with the rules of contract law.\n\nThe future of pre-nuptial agreementsDocument 2:::\nMade with full disclosure of financial information\n\nMade not less than 28 days before the marriage\n\nThe report also recommended that pre-nuptial agreements be reviewable on death. This is so that a court may make financial provision for a surviving spouse who may be unfairly affected by the provisions of a pre-nuptial agreement on the death of the other spouse in certain circumstances.\n\nThe report\u2019s recommendations have not yet been implemented.\n\nCohabitation agreements\n\nThe Civil Partnership and Certain Rights and Obligations of Cohabitants Act 2010 allows cohabitants to enter into a cohabitants\u2019 agreement to provide for financial matters during the relationship or when the relationship ends, whether through death or otherwise. However, the Act sets out that the agreement will only be valid if each person has had independent legal advice or the couple obtained legal advice together and have waived (in writing) the right to independent legal advice. The agreement must be in writing, signed by both parties and must comply with the general law of contract.\n\nThe Court can change or ignore such an agreement if its enforceability would cause serious injustice.\n\nFor further information on cohabitation, see \u2018 Rights of cohabiting couples (couples living together) \u2019.\n\nExample 1:\n\nQ: What documents do I need to apply online for a driver's license in Ireland?\nA: You need a Public Services Card and verified MyGovID, proof of your address if your address is different to the one you provided when you got your Public Services Card, proof that you are normally resident in Ireland if you are not an EU or EEA citizen, a medical report form, dated within one month if required, and a Certificate of Professional Competence (CPC) for professional drivers.\n\nExample 2:\n\nQ: What criteria do I need to meet to qualify for unemployment benefits in Ireland?\nA: You must be under 66 years of age, or under 70 years and\u202fdeferring your State Pension (Contributory), be unemployed (you must be unemployed for at least 4 days out of 7), have had a substantial loss of employment and as a result be unemployed for at least 4 days out of 7 (this does not apply to casual workers and part-time fire fighters), be capable of work, be available for and genuinely seeking work, and have enough social insurance (PRSI) contributions.\n\nExample 3:\nQ: What is the legal status of pre-nuptial agreements?\nA:\nPre-nuptial agreements have no basis in law in Ireland.
