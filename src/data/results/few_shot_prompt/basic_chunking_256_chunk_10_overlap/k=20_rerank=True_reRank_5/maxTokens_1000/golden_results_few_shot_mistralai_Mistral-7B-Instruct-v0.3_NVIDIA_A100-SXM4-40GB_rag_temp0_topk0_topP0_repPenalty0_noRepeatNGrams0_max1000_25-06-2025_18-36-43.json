Before 1 January 2005, everyone born on the island of Ireland was an Irish citizen by birth. Following an amendment to the Constitution of Ireland , citizenship by birth is no longer an automatic entitlement to everyone born on the island of Ireland.\n\nIf you are born abroad, you are entitled to Irish citizenship if your parent was born in Ireland. If your grandparents were born in Ireland, you may also be able to claim citizenship through the Foreign Births Register .\n\nResidents of Ireland who have come from abroad can apply to become Irish citizens through naturalisation .Document 1:::\nThis Act had a number of important provisions:\n\nAnyone born in Ireland was automatically an Irish citizen. People who were born in Northern Ireland were entitled to be Irish citizens if they chose it.\n\nA Foreign Births Register was established for descendants of Irish citizens born abroad.\n\nWives of Irish citizens (but not husbands) could claim Irish citizenship by signing a post-nuptial declaration. This practice ended in 2005.\n\nRules for naturalisation were set out.\n\nThe Act was amended a number of times, most importantly in 2004, following the 27th Amendment to the Constitution . This removed the automatic right to Irish citizenship by birth to all those born in Ireland.\n\nNorthern Ireland and Irish Citizenship\n\nThe Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956 gave people born in Northern Ireland the right to claim Irish citizenship if they chose to do so.\n\nThe Good Friday Agreement , which was signed between the Irish and British governments in 1998, confirmed that people born in Northern Ireland could choose to be either British or Irish citizens.Document 2:::\n4. Born in Ireland with no right to citizenship of another country\n\nIf none of the above applies to you and you were born in Ireland, but you are not entitled to citizenship of any other country, you are an Irish citizen by birth.\n\nIrish citizenship when you are born abroad\n\nIf either of your parents was born in Ireland and was an Irish citizen at the time of your birth, you are automatically an Irish citizen by birth.\n\nIf the parent through whom you are entitled to Irish citizenship was deceased at the time of your birth, but would have been an Irish citizen if alive at that time, you are also an Irish citizen.\n\nIrish citizen parent born outside Ireland\n\nIf you were born outside of Ireland and your parent (who was also born outside of Ireland) was an Irish citizen or entitled to be an Irish citizen at the time of your birth, then you are entitled to become an Irish citizen.\n\nTo claim Irish citizenship, you must have your birth registered in the Foreign Births Register , unless your parent was abroad in the public service at the time of your birth. If you are entitled to register, your Irish citizenship is effective from the date of registration \u2013 not from the date when you were born.Document 3:::\nHomepage: https://www.irishimmigration.ie/citizenship/\n\nEmail: citizenshipinfo@justice.ie\n\n_Page edited: 24 July 2024 _\n\nRelated documents\n\nIrish citizenship through birth or descent\n\nYou are not automatically an Irish citizen if you were born on the island of Ireland.

If you leave the country, you will continue to be ordinarily resident until you have been non- resident for 3 continuous tax years. See revenue.ie for more information on ordinary residence .\n\nResidence and married couples or civil partners\n\nFor a married couple or civil partners, the residence status of each spouse is assessed independently of the other. It is possible for one spouse or civil partner to be resident and the other to be non-resident. . If you are resident and your spouse is not, you are treated as single for tax purposes.\n\nHowever, if you are resident and employed in Ireland but your spouse or civil partner is not resident in Ireland and has no income - so that your earnings are the only source of income - then it may be possible to claim the Married or Civil Partner's Tax Credit and the increased tax rate band . You can do this after the end of the tax year when you file a return of income which includes a declaration about your spouse or civil partner's income.Document 1:::\nPeople who have contracted Hepatitis C through blood transfusion and have a Health Amendment Act Card\n\nWhat is ordinary residence?\n\nIf you are coming to live in Ireland or returning here to live, you must satisfy the Health Service Executive (HSE) that you are ordinarily resident \u2013 that you have been living in Ireland for at least a year or you intend to live here for at least one year.\n\nTo check that you are ordinarily resident the HSE may ask for:\n\nProof of property purchase or rental, including evidence that the property is your principal residence (for example, proof of rent from the local authority)\n\nA letter or statement from a financial institution (for example a bank statement or credit union statement)\n\nA current utility bill (such as a gas, electricity or phone bill)\n\nA current car or home insurance policy in your name\n\nAn official document from a government department (for example, a notice of assessment from Revenue or proof of rent from the Housing Assistance Payment Scheme)\n\nThe above documents must be dated within the last 12 months.Document 2:::\nYou spend 183 days or more in Ireland in that year or,\n\nIf you spend 280 days or more in Ireland over a period of 2 consecutive tax years, you will be regarded as resident for the second tax year. For example, if you spend 140 days here in Year 1 and 150 days here in Year 2, you will be resident in Ireland for Year 2.

However, UK citizens who have recently moved to Ireland may find it more difficult to establish that their main centre of interest is in Ireland.\n\nPeople from Ukraine\n\nPeople who have come from Ukraine and who are covered by the Temporary Protection Directive will satisfy the Habitual Residence Condition.\n\nWhat does habitually resident mean?\n\nThe term habitually resident is not defined in Irish law. In practice it means that you have a proven close link to Ireland. The term also conveys permanence - that a person has been here for some time and intends to stay here for the foreseeable future. Proving you are habitually resident relies heavily on fact. If you have lived in Ireland all your life, you will probably have no difficulty showing that you satisfy the factors which indicate habitual residence \u2013 see list below.Document 4:::\nYour spouse, civil partner or cohabitant and any dependent children you have are not required to satisfy the habitual residence condition in their own right. So if you apply for a social welfare payment only you, the applicant, have to satisfy the habitual residence condition.\n\nThe Department of Social Protection has published comprehensive Operational Guidelines on the habitual residence condition . It is sometimes referred to as the HRC.\n\nYou must be habitually resident in the State on the date you make the application and you must remain habitually resident in the State after you apply. This provision was added by the Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2014, which came into force on 17 July 2014. Before this, the habitual residence condition could only be examined on the date of application.\n\nSince 17 July 2014, the HRC decision on your case may be reviewed if any relevant circumstances change (for example, if you lose the right to reside) or if you were absent from the State for a significant period of time.\n\nRules for satisfying the habitual residence condition\n\nWho decides whether an applicant is habitually resident?\n\nExample 1:\n\nQ: What documents do I need to apply online for a driver's license in Ireland?\nA: You need a Public Services Card and verified MyGovID, proof of your address if your address is different to the one you provided when you got your Public Services Card, proof that you are normally resident in Ireland if you are not an EU or EEA citizen, a medical report form, dated within one month if required, and a Certificate of Professional Competence (CPC) for professional drivers.\n\nExample 2:\n\nQ: What criteria do I need to meet to qualify for unemployment benefits in Ireland?\nA: You must be under 66 years of age, or under 70 years and\u202fdeferring your State Pension (Contributory), be unemployed (you must be unemployed for at least 4 days out of 7), have had a substantial loss of employment and as a result be unemployed for at least 4 days out of 7 (this does not apply to casual workers and part-time fire fighters), be capable of work, be available for and genuinely seeking work, and have enough social insurance (PRSI) contributions.\n\nExample 3:\nQ: What is ordinary residence?\nA:\nYour pattern of residence over a number of years is taken into account to decide your \u2018ordinary residence\u2019.\n\nIf you have been resident for the previous 3 tax years, then you become ordinarily resident from the start of the fourth year.

It happens when your job in the company no longer exists, you are let go and are not replaced.\n\nRedundancy is a last option\n\nYour employer must consult with you before deciding to make you redundant. Redundancy is a last option and there must be valid economic, technical, or organisational grounds justifying changes in the workforce.\n\nBefore your employer makes you redundant, they might offer you another job in the business. This is known as \u2018 alternative work \u2019.\n\nWhat counts as genuine redundancy?Document 2:::\nUnfair selection for redundancy\n\nMaking a protected disclosure (that is, where you raise concerns about possible wrongdoing at work) under the Protected Disclosures Act 2014\n\nUnfair dismissal happens where:\n\nYour employer ends your contract of employment, with or without notice\n\nYou end your contract of employment, with or without notice, due to the conduct of your employer.

However, you may have grounds (reasons) for complaint if you were unfairly selected for redundancy , or if you feel there was no genuine need for redundancy.\n\nUnless your employer can prove there was a genuine redundancy situation and that they followed fair procedures , your dismissal may be considered \u2018unfair\u2019.Document 3:::\nUnless your employer can prove there was a genuine redundancy situation and that fair procedures were followed, your dismissal may be found to be unfair.\n\nEven if a genuine redundancy situation exists, you may bring a claim for unfair dismissal if you think that you were unfairly selected for redundancy. Your employer should apply selection criteria that are reasonable and are applied in a fair way.\n\nYou are made redundant on maternity leave\n\nYou cannot be made redundant while on maternity leave or additional maternity leave . You may be made redundant when you return to work or while you are pregnant before you go on maternity leave.\n\nIf you are selected for redundancy because you are pregnant, you may be able to bring a claim for unfair dismissal. Selection for redundancy based on certain grounds such as pregnancy is considered unfair under the unfair dismissals legislation.\n\nYou are made redundant on carer\u2019s leave\n\nIf you are dismissed on grounds of redundancy, while on carer\u2019s leave , under the Carer\u2019s Leave Act 2001 it would be considered unfair dismissal.Document 4:::\nEmployment permit holders\n\nThere are special rules for employment permit holders who have been made redundant . You must notify the Employment Permits Section of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment within 4 weeks of the redundancy using the Redundancy Notification Form . You have up to 6 months from the date on which you were made redundant to find another job.\n\nIf you have been made redundant after working on a work permit for 5 consecutive years you will no longer need a permit to work in Ireland.\n\nIf you entered the State on a valid employment permit but you fell out of the system through no fault of your own, or you have been badly treated or exploited in the workplace, you may be eligible for a Reactivation Employment Permit.\n\nRedundancy\n\nIf you are dismissed by your employer you should check if it is a redundancy situation, for example, the closure of a business. Your employer must prove that there was a genuine redundancy situation and that fair procedures were followed. If it is not a genuine redundancy or if you think you have been unfairly selected for redundancy, you may qualify to bring a claim for unfair dismissal.\n\nExample 1:\n\nQ: What documents do I need to apply online for a driver's license in Ireland?\nA: You need a Public Services Card and verified MyGovID, proof of your address if your address is different to the one you provided when you got your Public Services Card, proof that you are normally resident in Ireland if you are not an EU or EEA citizen, a medical report form, dated within one month if required, and a Certificate of Professional Competence (CPC) for professional drivers.\n\nExample 2:\n\nQ: What criteria do I need to meet to qualify for unemployment benefits in Ireland?\nA: You must be under 66 years of age, or under 70 years and\u202fdeferring your State Pension (Contributory), be unemployed (you must be unemployed for at least 4 days out of 7), have had a substantial loss of employment and as a result be unemployed for at least 4 days out of 7 (this does not apply to casual workers and part-time fire fighters), be capable of work, be available for and genuinely seeking work, and have enough social insurance (PRSI) contributions.\n\nExample 3:\nQ: What counts as genuine redundancy?\nA:\nA genuine redundancy is one where your employer has a real business reason to make you redundant. Reasons for redundancy include:\n\n* Financial difficulties within the business: for example, your employer needs to cut costs and this means staff numbers must be reduced.\n* Lack of work : for example, your employer no longer needs or has a reduced need for employees with your skills or new technology has made your job unnecessary.\n* Reorganisation within the business: for example, your employer has decided to carry on the business with fewer or no staff or the job you do no longer exists.\n* Business closure : the business is closing down or moving.\n\nThe employer must be able to justify that there is a genuine reason for making you redundant. The burden of proof is on your employer to show that a legitimate redundancy situation exists and that therefore the dismissal is fair. For the dismissal to be fair, your employer must also show that you were fairly selected for redundancy and that fair procedures were followed.",

They must also give you a minimum amount of notice, depending on how long your tenancy has lasted. These rules apply to private landlords, approved housing bodies and people who let student-specific accommodation.\n\nTerminating a tenancy\n\nIf your landlord wants you to leave your accommodation, they must serve you with a written notice of termination and give you the correct amount of notice .Document 1:::\nAdditional rules when ending a tenancy for a valid reason\n\nAdditional rules apply if your landlord ends your tenancy for certain valid reasons.\n\nRequirement to offer property back to the tenant\n\nIf your landlord ends your tenancy for one of the below reasons and the property then becomes available to rent again, the landlord must offer the property back to you within 12 months of the expiry of your notice period.\n\nThey must do this if they ended your tenancy because they:\n\nPlanned to sell the property within 9 months\n\nNeeded the property for their own use or for an immediate family member\n\nPlanned to change the use of the property\n\nPlanned to refurbish the property substantially\n\nYour landlord must make every reasonable effort to get your contact details, so they can offer the property back to you. This includes contacting the RTB to ask for them. The RTB may have your contact details to give to the landlord or they may contact you to get them. The RTB will only pass your details to the landlord if you have given your consent to do this.\n\nWhen your landlord contacts you to offer to re-let the property to you, you have 7 days to accept or reject this offer.Document 2:::\nFurther Part 4 tenancy\n\nFor tenancies created before 11 June 2022, a new tenancy begins after the first 6-year cycle of your Part 4 tenancy. This new tenancy will now be a tenancy of unlimited duration, unless the landlord terminates it, see \u2018Landlords' right to end a tenancy every 6 years\u2019 below. However, under the old rules, you would have a further Part 4 tenancy.\n\nWhen you have a Part 4 tenancy or further Part 4 tenancy, your landlord can only terminate your tenancy in certain circumstances. Read more about when a landlord can terminate your tenancy in our page If your landlord wants you to leave .\n\nIf you have a fixed-term agreement and want to leave, you do not have to give a reason, but you must give the correct period of notice in writing \u2013 see \u2018Ending your tenancy\u2019 below.\n\nLandlords' right to end a tenancy every 6 years\n\nIf your tenancy was created before 11 June 2022, your landlord can terminate your tenancy after 6 years for any reason. This is only allowed if:Document 3:::\nGive a notice period that expires on or after the end of the tenancy\n\nIf the tenancy is not ended after 6 years, a new tenancy will begin. This new tenancy will be a tenancy of unlimited duration and the above exception will no longer apply.\n\nBy June 2028, all tenancies will be tenancies of unlimited duration and the above exception will no longer apply. This is because all existing 6-year cycle tenancies will have ended by then.\n\nExceptions to Part 4 rights\n\nIf you are renting a self-contained flat or apartment in your landlord\u2019s home, which was originally part of the main house, your landlord can choose to opt out of the Part 4 provisions. If your landlord wants to take this option, you must get notice of this in writing, before the start of the tenancy.\n\nTenants of certain properties let by housing associations do not get Part 4 rights. For example, people living in transitional housing. Transitional housing is temporary supported accommodation that helps people move from homelessness to independent living in permanent accommodation.\n\nPart 4 rights do not apply to tenants in student-specific accommodation.\n\nAdditional rules when ending a tenancy for a valid reasonDocument 4:::\nYou only need to give your landlord 28 days\u2019 notice when ending a tenancy. You can give your landlord more notice if you want and your landlord must give you more. This came in under the Residential Tenancies (No. 2) Act 2021 .\n\nYou can terminate your fixed-term tenancy any time between 1 May and 1 October each year for any reason. But, outside of these dates, the existing rules about ending a fixed-term tenancy apply and you can only terminate your tenancy for specific reasons. This rule came in under the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2024 .\n\nFind out more about your rights as a tenant in student-specific accommodation on the RTB\u2019s website .\n\nSecurity of tenure\n\nSecurity of tenure is a tenant\u2019s right to stay in rented accommodation for a set amount of time. Generally, security of tenure applies automatically when you have been renting for 6 months and haven\u2019t received a valid notice of termination from your landlord in that time. When you have security of tenure, your landlord can only terminate your tenancy for a limited number of reasons, see our page \u2018 If your landlord wants you to leave \u2019.\n\nExample 1:\n\nQ: What documents do I need to apply online for a driver's license in Ireland?\nA: You need a Public Services Card and verified MyGovID, proof of your address if your address is different to the one you provided when you got your Public Services Card, proof that you are normally resident in Ireland if you are not an EU or EEA citizen, a medical report form, dated within one month if required, and a Certificate of Professional Competence (CPC) for professional drivers.\n\nExample 2:\n\nQ: What criteria do I need to meet to qualify for unemployment benefits in Ireland?\nA: You must be under 66 years of age, or under 70 years and\u202fdeferring your State Pension (Contributory), be unemployed (you must be unemployed for at least 4 days out of 7), have had a substantial loss of employment and as a result be unemployed for at least 4 days out of 7 (this does not apply to casual workers and part-time fire fighters), be capable of work, be available for and genuinely seeking work, and have enough social insurance (PRSI) contributions.\n\nExample 3:\nQ: What is a valid reason for ending a tenancy after the first 6 months?\nA:\n\n* The landlord wants to sell the property within 9 months\n* The landlord needs the property for their own use or for an immediate family member\n* The landlord plans to change the use of the property\n* The landlord plans to refurbish the property substantially\n* The tenancy is a Part 4 tenancy and the landlord wants to end it after 6 years, giving a notice period that expires on or after the end of the tenancy.",

A trader does not have to deliver to Ireland.\n\nHowever, a seller cannot deny you access to their goods and services based on your nationality or place of residence under the Geo-blocking Regulation. This means that you have a right to order the goods and collect them at the trader\u2019s premises, or have them delivered to an address or pick up point, where the trader offers these options to local customers.\n\nYou can find examples from the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC) on how the Geo-blocking Regulations apply (pdf) .\n\nMy goods are delayed\n\nYour purchase must be delivered without undue delay and not later than 30 days from the date the order was placed (unless you agreed to a different date).

Because of this, you have extra protections under EU law.\n\nBought online from a UK trader\n\nIf you bought online from a UK trader after 1 January 2021, you may not automatically have the same consumer rights.

These rights do not apply if you buy from a trader based outside the EU.\n\nFrom 1 January 2021, you should be especially careful when buying from a UK seller.

If the respondent is in court when the order is made the respondent is considered to be notified and it is sent by the court office to the respondent by ordinary post. However, in the case of a protection order, interim barring order or emergency barring order the court usually directs that order be served on the respondent by a member of the Garda\u00ed.\n\nThe court office will notify the Garda\u00ed of the making of the order by sending a copy to the local Garda station by post. To avoid any delay in notifying the Garda\u00ed you should call to the Garda station immediately after the order has been made, tell them of the making of the order and leave a copy with them (you can allow them to take a photocopy).

As a result, they are not strictly binding. This means that if you have a pre-nuptial agreement in place and you end up in court following the breakdown of your marriage, the judge is not bound by the terms of the pre-nuptial agreement.\n\nThe only provision in Irish law is under sections 113 and 113A of the Succession Act 1965 (as amended) where a spouse or a civil partner can renounce his/her legal right share in a pre-nuptial agreement.Document 1:::\nAlthough they are not legally binding, there is nothing in Irish law which stops a couple planning to marry from having and signing a pre-nuptial agreement.

Therefore, in situations where one party is likely to inherit a significant family farm or business, it will guide the judge in the divorce or judicial separation on what the parties\u2019 intentions were at the outset.\n\nDrafting a pre-nuptial agreement\n\nOnly pre-nuptial agreements entered into following independent legal advice for both parties are likely to be taken into account. The court would have to be satisfied that there had been a complete disclosure of assets before the agreement was signed. It is also advisable for the agreement to provide for reviews:\n\nPeriodically (for example, every five years)\n\nIf children are born\n\nIf there is a major change in circumstances (for example, assets are purchased or sold)\n\nThe agreement should be in writing, be signed by each party and comply with the rules of contract law.\n\nThe future of pre-nuptial agreementsDocument 2:::\nA court must make sure that spouses and children are adequately taken care of when a marriage breaks down. A pre-nuptial agreement is not legally binding, but it can serve as a guide for the courts on what the parties\u2019 intentions were at the outset of the marriage in judicial separation and divorce cases.\n\nYour property rights if you are not married\n\nIf you are cohabiting (living together but not married) and your relationship breaks down, the family home will belong to the person who holds the legal title to the home. This could be one of you, or both of you.\n\nYou are not married but your name is on the title deeds\n\nIf both your names are on the title deeds, you are both legal owners of the property. You jointly have to make decisions as to what will happen to the property.\n\nIf you cannot come to an agreement, you can apply to the court to have the property sold and the proceeds divided, or it may be possible to seek an order breaking up the property. This would allow each party to decide what to do with their portion. This may be possible where there is a lot of land connected to the family home, or if there is more than one residence on the property.Document 3:::\nMade with full disclosure of financial information\n\nMade not less than 28 days before the marriage\n\nThe report also recommended that pre-nuptial agreements be reviewable on death. This is so that a court may make financial provision for a surviving spouse who may be unfairly affected by the provisions of a pre-nuptial agreement on the death of the other spouse in certain circumstances.\n\nThe report\u2019s recommendations have not yet been implemented.\n\nCohabitation agreements\n\nThe Civil Partnership and Certain Rights and Obligations of Cohabitants Act 2010 allows cohabitants to enter into a cohabitants\u2019 agreement to provide for financial matters during the relationship or when the relationship ends, whether through death or otherwise. However, the Act sets out that the agreement will only be valid if each person has had independent legal advice or the couple obtained legal advice together and have waived (in writing) the right to independent legal advice. The agreement must be in writing, signed by both parties and must comply with the general law of contract.\n\nThe Court can change or ignore such an agreement if its enforceability would cause serious injustice.\n\nFor further information on cohabitation, see \u2018 Rights of cohabiting couples (couples living together) \u2019.Document 4:::\nYou cannot sell, mortgage, lease or transfer your family home without the consent (permission) of your spouse. This is set out in the Family Home Protection Act 1976 as amended by the Family Law Act 1995 . Similar protection is provided for the shared home of civil partners in civil partnership legislation. These provisions do not apply to cohabiting couples.\n\nProperty adjustment order\n\nIf you are married and applying for judicial separation or divorce , and you cannot agree on what happens to the house, the court will make a property adjustment order . This is where the court decides what happens to the property.\n\nThe court will consider a range of factors before making a property adjustment order, including your financial and accommodation needs. Depending on these factors, the court will decide which assets (or percentage of the assets) you and your spouse should get.\n\nPre-nuptial agreements\n\nA pre-nuptial agreement (also called an ante-nuptial agreement ) is an agreement between two people who plan to marry each other. It relates to property, maintenance and custody arrangements in the event of marriage breakdown.\n\nExample 1:\n\nQ: What documents do I need to apply online for a driver's license in Ireland?\nA: You need a Public Services Card and verified MyGovID, proof of your address if your address is different to the one you provided when you got your Public Services Card, proof that you are normally resident in Ireland if you are not an EU or EEA citizen, a medical report form, dated within one month if required, and a Certificate of Professional Competence (CPC) for professional drivers.\n\nExample 2:\n\nQ: What criteria do I need to meet to qualify for unemployment benefits in Ireland?\nA: You must be under 66 years of age, or under 70 years and\u202fdeferring your State Pension (Contributory), be unemployed (you must be unemployed for at least 4 days out of 7), have had a substantial loss of employment and as a result be unemployed for at least 4 days out of 7 (this does not apply to casual workers and part-time fire fighters), be capable of work, be available for and genuinely seeking work, and have enough social insurance (PRSI) contributions.\n\nExample 3:\nQ: What is the legal status of pre-nuptial agreements?\nA:\nPre-nuptial agreements have no basis in law in Ireland.

This means that if you have a pre-nuptial agreement in place and you end up in court following the breakdown of your marriage, the judge is not bound by the terms of the pre-nuptial agreement.

You can make a complaint online .\n\nIf you have a complaint about a flight returning to Ireland from the EU/EEA, you contact the national enforcement body in the EU/EEA state your flight departed from.\n\nExample 1:\n\nQ: What documents do I need to apply online for a driver's license in Ireland?\nA: You need a Public Services Card and verified MyGovID, proof of your address if your address is different to the one you provided when you got your Public Services Card, proof that you are normally resident in Ireland if you are not an EU or EEA citizen, a medical report form, dated within one month if required, and a Certificate of Professional Competence (CPC) for professional drivers.\n\nExample 2:\n\nQ: What criteria do I need to meet to qualify for unemployment benefits in Ireland?\nA: You must be under 66 years of age, or under 70 years and\u202fdeferring your State Pension (Contributory), be unemployed (you must be unemployed for at least 4 days out of 7), have had a substantial loss of employment and as a result be unemployed for at least 4 days out of 7 (this does not apply to casual workers and part-time fire fighters), be capable of work, be available for and genuinely seeking work, and have enough social insurance (PRSI) contributions.\n\nExample 3:\nQ: Who regulates aviation in Ireland?\nA:\nThe Irish Aviation Authority (IAA) is the single national aviation regulator. It is responsible for safety, security, and consumer protection functions. The IAA has taken on functions previously held by the Commission for Aviation Regulation.\n\nThe IAA can deal with complaints about air carriers or airport management based in Ireland who do not comply with assistance for reduced mobility passenger rules. It is the national enforcement body for the monitoring and regulation of EU legislation on flight delay, cancellation or denied boarding and the provision of assistance to passengers with reduced mobility.\n\nThe IAA is responsible for licensing the travel industry (both tour operators and travel agents), Irish airlines, groundhandling operations, and registering drone operators.",
