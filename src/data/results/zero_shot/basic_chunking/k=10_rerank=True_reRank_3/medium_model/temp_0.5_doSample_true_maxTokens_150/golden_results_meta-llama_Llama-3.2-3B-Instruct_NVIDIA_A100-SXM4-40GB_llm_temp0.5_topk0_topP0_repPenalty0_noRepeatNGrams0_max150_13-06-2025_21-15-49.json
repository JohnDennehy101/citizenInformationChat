It can also be used to renovate vacant and derelict properties that have not been used as residential properties before. However, this only applies if the non-residential properties were used for commercial or public use before and now have the correct planning permission. You can get the grant if you are refurbishing the vacant property so you can live there, or so you can rent the property out. You can get a grant of up to \u20ac50,000 to renovate a vacant property and up to \u20ac70,000, if the property is derelict. You can get more if you are living on an off-shore island. And, there is an additional grant for expert conservation advice if you are refurbishing a vacant traditional farmhouse. The Vacant Property Refurbishment Grant is funded by the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage through the Cro\u00ed C\u00f3naithe (Towns) Fund and you apply to your local authority. If you have questions about the grant or want to know if your property qualifies, you can: Read the FAQs about the grant Contact the Vacant Homes Officer in your local authority Contact the Housing Agency's Vacancy Helpline on vacancycampaign@housingagency.ie You can also find information on how to re-use old and vacant buildings in the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage\u2019s Bringing Back Homes (pdf) manual.",
            "question": "What is the Vacant Property Refurbishment Grant?",
            "answer": "The Vacant Property Refurbishment Grant is a government-funded scheme that provides financial assistance to homeowners, landlords, and local authorities to help with the costs of refurbishing and bringing vacant properties back into use. The grant is designed to support the regeneration of urban areas and the revitalization of local communities.\n\nIn this case, the Vacant Property Refurbishment Grant is a key tool for addressing the issue of vacant and derelict properties, which can have a negative impact on local communities and economies. By providing financial support for refurbishment, the grant aims to help bring these properties back into use, reducing the number of vacant and derelict properties and contributing to the overall regeneration of the area.",

The only provision in Irish law is under sections 113 and 113A of the Succession Act 1965 (as amended) where a spouse or a civil partner can renounce his/her legal right share in a pre-nuptial agreement. Although they are not legally binding, there is nothing in Irish law which stops a couple planning to marry from having and signing a pre-nuptial agreement. Importantly, such agreements can serve as guides for the courts in judicial separation and divorce cases. If a pre-nuptial agreement makes \u2018proper provision\u2019 for each person it is more likely to be persuasive on the judge.

            "answer": "The Cycle to Work Scheme is a tax-free benefit provided by employers to encourage employees to cycle to work. It allows employees to borrow a bike from their employer at a reduced price, and then repay the loan through their salary over a set period of time. This scheme is designed to promote cycling as a mode of transport and reduce carbon emissions. The employer pays the full cost of the bike, and the employee only pays a percentage of the bike's value through their salary. The scheme is usually available to employees who commute to work by bike and is designed to be a cost-effective and environmentally friendly alternative to driving a car.",
