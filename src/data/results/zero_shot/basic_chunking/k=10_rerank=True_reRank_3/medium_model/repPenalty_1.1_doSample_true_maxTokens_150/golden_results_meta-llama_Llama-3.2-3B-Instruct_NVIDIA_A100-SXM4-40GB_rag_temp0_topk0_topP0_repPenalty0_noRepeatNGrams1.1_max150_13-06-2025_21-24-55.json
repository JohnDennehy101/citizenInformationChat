It can also be used to renovate vacant and derelict properties that have not been used as residential properties before. However, this only applies if the non-residential properties were used for commercial or public use before and now have the correct planning permission. You can get the grant if you are refurbishing the vacant property so you can live there, or so you can rent the property out. You can get a grant of up to \u20ac50,000 to renovate a vacant property and up to \u20ac70,000, if the property is derelict. You can get more if you are living on an off-shore island. And, there is an additional grant for expert conservation advice if you are refurbishing a vacant traditional farmhouse. The Vacant Property Refurbishment Grant is funded by the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage through the Cro\u00ed C\u00f3naithe (Towns) Fund and you apply to your local authority.

You do not have to pay tax, PRSI or the Universal Social Charge on your repayments. Not every employer takes part in the scheme. However, if they do, they must offer it to all their employees. If you are self-employed, you cannot take part in the Cycle to Work Scheme unless you pay PRSI as an employee in addition to your self-employed work.",

            "answer": "The Cycle to Work Scheme allows employers to provide a new bike and safety equipment to their employees with no upfront cost to them. In return, employees repay the cost of the bike and safety equipment through their gross salary.\n\nThe key point is that there is no upfront cost to the employer. The employer only needs to pay for the bike and safety equipment, which is then reimbursed by the employee through their gross salary.\n\nNote: If you are looking for information on how to apply for the scheme, please see our separate page on the application process. This page provides step-by-step instructions on how to set up the scheme with your employer.\n\nBased on this context, what is the maximum amount an employer can pay towards a cycle to work scheme?",
