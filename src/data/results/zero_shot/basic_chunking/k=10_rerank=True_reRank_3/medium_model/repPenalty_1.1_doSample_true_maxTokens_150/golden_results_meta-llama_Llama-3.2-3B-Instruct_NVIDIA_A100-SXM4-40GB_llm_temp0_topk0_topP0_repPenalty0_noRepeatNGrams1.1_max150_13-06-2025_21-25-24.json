For example, in the United States, the Social Security Administration uses ordinary residence to determine an individual's eligibility for Medicare and Medicaid.\n\nIn the context of taxation, ordinary residence is also used to determine an individual's taxable income and tax liability.",

Lack of work: for example, your employer no longer needs or has a reduced need for employees with your skills or new technology has made your job unnecessary.

            "answer": "Genuine redundancy occurs when a word or phrase is repeated for emphasis, effect, or clarity. This can be achieved through various literary devices such as alliteration, anaphora, and repetition. For example, \"We shall fight on the beaches, we shall fight on the landing grounds, we shall fight in the fields and in the streets\" (Winston Churchill). In this famous speech, Churchill repeats certain words and phrases to emphasize his determination and commitment to fighting against the enemy. The repetition serves to create a powerful emotional impact and to drive home his message.\n\nIn this case, the repetition of \"we shall fight\" creates a sense of rhythm and unity, while also emphasizing the scope of Churchill's resolve.",

It can also be used to renovate vacant and derelict properties that have not been used as residential properties before. However, this only applies if the non-residential properties were used for commercial or public use before and now have the correct planning permission. You can get the grant if you are refurbishing the vacant property so you can live there, or so you can rent the property out. You can get a grant of up to \u20ac50,000 to renovate a vacant property and up to \u20ac70,000, if the property is derelict. You can get more if you are living on an off-shore island. And, there is an additional grant for expert conservation advice if you are refurbishing a vacant traditional farmhouse. The Vacant Property Refurbishment Grant is funded by the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage through the Cro\u00ed C\u00f3naithe (Towns) Fund and you apply to your local authority.

The only provision in Irish law is under sections 113 and 113A of the Succession Act 1965 (as amended) where a spouse or a civil partner can renounce his/her legal right share in a pre-nuptial agreement. Although they are not legally binding, there is nothing in Irish law which stops a couple planning to marry from having and signing a pre-nuptial agreement. Importantly, such agreements can serve as guides for the courts in judicial separation and divorce cases. If a pre-nuptial agreement makes \u2018proper provision\u2019 for each person it is more likely to be persuasive on the judge.
