A genuine redundancy is one where your employer has a real business reason to make you redundant. Reasons for redundancy include: Financial difficulties within the business: for example, your employer needs to cut costs and this means staff numbers must be reduced. Lack of work: for example, your employer no longer needs or has a reduced need for employees with your skills or new technology has made your job unnecessary. Reorganisation within the business: for example, your employer has decided to carry on the business with fewer or no staff or the job you do no longer exists. Business closure: the business is closing down or moving.",
            "question": "What counts as genuine redundancy?",
            "answer": "Genuine redundancy occurs when a redundant feature or function is not simply a replacement for a missing or failed primary feature, but rather a distinct and valuable addition that complements the primary function. In other words, a genuine redundant system or feature provides a backup or alternative that can take over in case of failure, thereby increasing the overall reliability and robustness of the system.\n\nExample: A backup power source in a data center is a great example of genuine redemption. The primary power supply is the main source of energy, while the backup generator provides an alternative source that kicks in if the power goes out. This redundant setup increases the reliability of critical systems and ensures business continuity.",

However, this only applies if the non-residential properties were used for commercial or public use before and now have the correct planning permission. You can get the grant if you are refurbishing the vacant property so you can live there, or so you can rent the property out. You can get a grant of up to \u20ac50,000 to renovate a vacant property and up to \u20ac70,000, if the property is derelict. You can get more if you are living on an off-shore island. And, there is an additional grant for expert conservation advice if you are refurbishing a vacant traditional farmhouse. The Vacant Property Refurbishment Grant is funded by the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage through the Cro\u00ed C\u00f3naithe (Towns) Fund and you apply to your local authority. If you have questions about the grant or want to know if your property qualifies, you can: Read the FAQs about the grant Contact the Vacant Homes Officer in your local authority Contact the Housing Agency's Vacancy Helpline on vacancycampaign@housingagency.ie You can also find information on how to re-use old and vacant buildings in the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage\u2019s Bringing Back Homes (pdf) manual.",
            "question": "What is the Vacant Property Refurbishment Grant?",
            "answer": "The Vacancy Reduction Grant, also known as the Empty Homes Grant or Vacants Property Grant (VPG), is a government-funded program that provides financial assistance to property owners to encourage the rehabilitation and occupation of vacant or derelict properties. The Vacancies Reduction Grants are part of the government's efforts to tackle the issue of urban decay and the empty homes problem. These grants can be used for various purposes such as clearing the property, repairing or replacing the roof, installing new windows, and improving the interior of a property. By providing financial support, the grants aim to help property developers and homeowners to bring vacant properties back into use, thus reducing the number of empty and derilict homes in urban areas.",

The only provision in Irish law is under sections 113 and 113A of the Succession Act 1965 (as amended) where a spouse or a civil partner can renounce his/her legal right share in a pre-nuptial agreement. Although they are not legally binding, there is nothing in Irish law which stops a couple planning to marry from having and signing a pre-nuptial agreement. Importantly, such agreements can serve as guides for the courts in judicial separation and divorce cases. If a pre-nuptial agreement makes \u2018proper provision\u2019 for each person it is more likely to be persuasive on the judge.

            "question": "What is the Cycle to Work Scheme?",
            "answer": "The Cycle-to-Work Scheme is a government-backed initiative that allows employees to cycle to work and claim back the cost of their bike as a tax deduction. The scheme is designed to encourage cycling as an alternative to driving, reducing traffic congestion and promoting a healthier lifestyle. To qualify, employees must cycle at least 16 miles a week to their workplace and keep a log of the miles cycled. This log is then submitted to HMRC to claim the tax relief. \n\nIn some countries, the scheme may be administered by a third party or a local authority, while in others it may only be available to employees of specific companies or organizations.",

Trains run approximately every 10-15 minutes during peak hours, and less frequently during off-peak hours.\n\nNote: There are two Luasha lines, the Red Line and the Green Line. Both lines have the same operating schedule and hours. However, it's always a good idea to check the Transport Infrastructure Ireland (TII) website or the luas app for the most up-to-date information on Luasa schedules and service disruptions.",
