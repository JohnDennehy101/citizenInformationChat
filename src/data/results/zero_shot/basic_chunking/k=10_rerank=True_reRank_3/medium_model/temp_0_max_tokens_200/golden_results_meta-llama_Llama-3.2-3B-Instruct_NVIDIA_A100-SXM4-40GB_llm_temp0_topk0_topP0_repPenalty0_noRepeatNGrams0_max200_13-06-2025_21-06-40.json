In this case, John's ordinary residence is the small town in the United States, where he sleeps, eats, and carries out his daily activities.\n\nNote: The concept of ordinary residence can vary depending on the jurisdiction and the specific tax laws in place. It is essential to consult with a tax professional or the relevant tax authorities to determine an individual's ordinary residence and the tax implications that apply to them.",

A genuine redundancy is one where your employer has a real business reason to make you redundant. Reasons for redundancy include: Financial difficulties within the business: for example, your employer needs to cut costs and this means staff numbers must be reduced. Lack of work: for example, your employer no longer needs or has a reduced need for employees with your skills or new technology has made your job unnecessary. Reorganisation within the business: for example, your employer has decided to carry on the business with fewer or no staff or the job you do no longer exists. Business closure: the business is closing down or moving.",
            "question": "What counts as genuine redundancy?",
            "answer": "Genuine redundancy occurs when a word or phrase is repeated for emphasis, effect, or to create a specific tone or atmosphere. This repetition is not just for the sake of repetition, but serves a purpose in conveying meaning, creating a sense of rhythm, or evoking a particular emotional response. For example, in the phrase \"We shall fight on the beaches, in the streets, and in the fields,\" the repetition of \"in the\" emphasizes the scope of the resistance and creates a sense of determination.\n\nIn contrast, mere repetition without any clear purpose or effect is not considered genuine redundancy. For instance, repeating a word or phrase simply because it sounds good or is easy to say is not considered redundant.\n\nTherefore, genuine redundancy is a deliberate and intentional repetition of words or phrases that serves a specific purpose, whereas mere repetition is simply a stylistic choice.",

You can get the grant if you are refurbishing the vacant property so you can live there, or so you can rent the property out. You can get a grant of up to \u20ac50,000 to renovate a vacant property and up to \u20ac70,000, if the property is derelict. You can get more if you are living on an off-shore island. And, there is an additional grant for expert conservation advice if you are refurbishing a vacant traditional farmhouse. The Vacant Property Refurbishment Grant is funded by the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage through the Cro\u00ed C\u00f3naithe (Towns) Fund and you apply to your local authority.

The specifics of the law vary by country, but the general idea is that employers are required to provide a certain amount of paid annual leave to their employees, and employees are expected to take it.\n\nIn the UK, for example, the Working Time Regulations 1998 require employers to provide a minimum of 28 days' paid annual leave per year, plus bank holidays. If an employee doesn't take their annual leave, their employer can deduct the amount of leave they're owed from their pay.\n\nIn Australia, the Fair Work Act 2009 requires employers to provide a minimum of 4 weeks' paid annual leave per year, plus 10 public holidays.

For example, a minor offense might be assigned 1-3 points, while a more serious offense might be assigned 4-6 points or more.\n- **Accumulation**: The driver's license will accumulate penalty points over time, and the total number of points will be tracked.\n- **Thresholds**: Most jurisdictions have established thresholds for the number of penalty points that can be accumulated before a driver's license is suspended or revoked.",

This means that if you have a pre-nuptial agreement in place and you end up in court following the breakdown of your marriage, the judge is not bound by the terms of the pre-nuptial agreement. The only provision in Irish law is under sections 113 and 113A of the Succession Act 1965 (as amended) where a spouse or a civil partner can renounce his/her legal right share in a pre-nuptial agreement. Although they are not legally binding, there is nothing in Irish law which stops a couple planning to marry from having and signing a pre-nuptial agreement. Importantly, such agreements can serve as guides for the courts in judicial separation and divorce cases. If a pre-nuptial agreement makes \u2018proper provision\u2019 for each person it is more likely to be persuasive on the judge.

            "question": "Who regulates aviation in Ireland?",
            "answer": "Aviation in Ireland is regulated by the Civil Aviation Authority of Ireland (CAAI). The CAAI is responsible for ensuring that all aspects of aviation in Ireland, including air traffic control, aircraft maintenance, and pilot licensing, are carried out in a safe and efficient manner.\n\nAdditional Information:\nThe CAAI is also responsible for implementing and enforcing aviation regulations, which are set by the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) and the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). The CAAI works closely with other regulatory bodies, such as the Irish Aviation Authority (IAA), to ensure that aviation in Ireland is safe and compliant with international standards.\n\nNote: The Irish Aviation Authority (IAA) is a separate entity that is responsible for the licensing and regulation of airports in Ireland, as well as the management of air traffic control services. While the IAA is involved in aviation regulation, the CAAI is the primary regulator of aviation in Ireland.",

            "ground_truth": "Under the Cycle to Work Scheme (also known as the Bike to Work Scheme), you can get a new bike tax free through your work. Your employer pays for a new bike and then you repay the cost of regular instalments from your gross (overall) salary. You do not have to pay tax, PRSI or the Universal Social Charge on your repayments. Not every employer takes part in the scheme. However, if they do, they must offer it to all their employees. If you are self-employed, you cannot take part in the Cycle to Work Scheme unless you pay PRSI as an employee in addition to your self-employed work.",
            "question": "What is the Cycle to Work Scheme?",
            "answer": "The Cycle to Work Scheme is a tax-free benefit provided by employers to encourage employees to cycle to work. It allows employees to pay for a new bike or cycling gear through their salary, rather than paying cash upfront. The scheme is designed to promote cycling as a mode of transport and reduce carbon emissions. The scheme is usually offered by employers as a benefit to their employees, and the details of the scheme can vary depending on the employer and the country or region in which it is offered.\n\nAdditional Answer:\nThe Cycle to Work Scheme is a popular initiative that has been adopted by many employers in the UK, Ireland, and other countries. It is designed to encourage employees to cycle to work, which can have numerous benefits for both the individual and the environment. By providing a tax-free benefit, employers can help reduce their employees' carbon footprint and promote a healthier lifestyle.",
