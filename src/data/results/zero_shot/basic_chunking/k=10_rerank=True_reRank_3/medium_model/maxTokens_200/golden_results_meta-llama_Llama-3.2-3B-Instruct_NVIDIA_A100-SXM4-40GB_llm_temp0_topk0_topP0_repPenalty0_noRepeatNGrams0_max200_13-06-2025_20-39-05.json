Lack of work: for example, your employer no longer needs or has a reduced need for employees with your skills or new technology has made your job unnecessary.

This can include things like having multiple copies of critical data, multiple servers for a network, or redundant systems for a manufacturing process. The key characteristic of genuine redundancy is that it provides a safeguard against loss or failure of the primary resource, and is often implemented to mitigate the risk of downtime or data loss.\n\nIn this scenario, the concept of genuine redundancy is relevant to the topic of computer systems and networks, as it is a key consideration in the design and implementation of fault-tolerant systems.",

It can also be used to renovate vacant and derelict properties that have not been used as residential properties before. However, this only applies if the non-residential properties were used for commercial or public use before and now have the correct planning permission. You can get the grant if you are refurbishing the vacant property so you can live there, or so you can rent the property out. You can get a grant of up to \u20ac50,000 to renovate a vacant property and up to \u20ac70,000, if the property is derelict. You can get more if you are living on an off-shore island. And, there is an additional grant for expert conservation advice if you are refurbishing a vacant traditional farmhouse. The Vacant Property Refurbishment Grant is funded by the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage through the Cro\u00ed C\u00f3naithe (Towns) Fund and you apply to your local authority.

This means that if you have a pre-nuptial agreement in place and you end up in court following the breakdown of your marriage, the judge is not bound by the terms of the pre-nuptial agreement. The only provision in Irish law is under sections 113 and 113A of the Succession Act 1965 (as amended) where a spouse or a civil partner can renounce his/her legal right share in a pre-nuptial agreement. Although they are not legally binding, there is nothing in Irish law which stops a couple planning to marry from having and signing a pre-nuptial agreement. Importantly, such agreements can serve as guides for the courts in judicial separation and divorce cases. If a pre-nuptial agreement makes \u2018proper provision\u2019 for each person it is more likely to be persuasive on the judge.

            "ground_truth": "Under the Cycle to Work Scheme (also known as the Bike to Work Scheme), you can get a new bike tax free through your work. Your employer pays for a new bike and then you repay the cost of regular instalments from your gross (overall) salary. You do not have to pay tax, PRSI or the Universal Social Charge on your repayments. Not every employer takes part in the scheme. However, if they do, they must offer it to all their employees. If you are self-employed, you cannot take part in the Cycle to Work Scheme unless you pay PRSI as an employee in addition to your self-employed work.",
            "question": "What is the Cycle to Work Scheme?",
            "answer": "The Cycle to Work Scheme is a tax-free cycling initiative launched by the UK Government in 2010. It allows employees to save up to \u00a31,000 per year on their income tax through cycling to work. The scheme encourages people to use bicycles as a mode of transport and reduces the financial burden of commuting. To participate in the scheme, employees must cycle to work at least three times a week and have their employer sign up to the scheme. The employer is responsible for paying the employee's income tax and National Insurance Contributions (NICs) on their behalf. This initiative promotes sustainable transportation, reduces traffic congestion, and helps to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nNote: This answer is based on general knowledge and may not reflect the current details or rules of the Cycle to Work Scheme. For the most up-to-date information, it's recommended to check with the UK Government or the relevant authorities.",

On average, Luas trains run every 5-10 minutes during peak hours and every 20-30 minutes during off-peak hours.\n\nNote: The Luas operates on a 30-minute cycle, which means that a train will depart from one station to another every 30 minutes, even if there are no passengers waiting at the stop.\n\nPlease note that the operating hours and frequency may be subject to change, so it's always best to check the official Luas website or a reliable transportation source for the most up-to-date information.",
