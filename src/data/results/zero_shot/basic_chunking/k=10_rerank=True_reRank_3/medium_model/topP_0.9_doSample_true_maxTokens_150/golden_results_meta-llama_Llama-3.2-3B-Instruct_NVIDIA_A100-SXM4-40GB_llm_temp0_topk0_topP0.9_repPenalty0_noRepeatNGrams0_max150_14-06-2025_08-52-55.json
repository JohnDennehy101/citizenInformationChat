A genuine redundancy is one where your employer has a real business reason to make you redundant.

Lack of work: for example, your employer no longer needs or has a reduced need for employees with your skills or new technology has made your job unnecessary. Reorganisation within the business: for example, your employer has decided to carry on the business with fewer or no staff or the job you do no longer exists.

            "answer": "Genuine redundancy occurs when a system or process is duplicated to provide an additional layer of protection or functionality, such as a backup power source or a duplicate server. This type of redundancy is considered genuine because it is intended to provide a critical function or prevent a critical failure, rather than simply providing an alternative way of doing something.\n\nIn this case, the system or process is not simply duplicated for the sake of duplication, but rather to provide a specific benefit or to mitigate a specific risk. For example, a hospital might have a backup generator to provide power in case of a grid failure, or a company might have a duplicate server to ensure business continuity in case of a hardware failure.",

However, this only applies if the non-residential properties were used for commercial or public use before and now have the correct planning permission. You can get the grant if you are refurbishing the vacant property so you can live there, or so you can rent the property out. You can get a grant of up to \u20ac50,000 to renovate a vacant property and up to \u20ac70,000, if the property is derelict. You can get more if you are living on an off-shore island. And, there is an additional grant for expert conservation advice if you are refurbishing a vacant traditional farmhouse. The Vacant Property Refurbishment Grant is funded by the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage through the Cro\u00ed C\u00f3naithe (Towns) Fund and you apply to your local authority. If you have questions about the grant or want to know if your property qualifies, you can: Read the FAQs about the grant Contact the Vacant Homes Officer in your local authority Contact the Housing Agency's Vacancy Helpline on vacancycampaign@housingagency.ie You can also find information on how to re-use old and vacant buildings in the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage\u2019s Bringing Back Homes (pdf) manual.",
            "question": "What is the Vacant Property Refurbishment Grant?",
            "answer": "The Vacant Property Refurbishment Grant is a funding scheme provided by local authorities in the UK to help homeowners and tenants in England and Wales refurbish and bring back to life vacant properties in their area. The grant is designed to support the regeneration of urban areas by encouraging the renovation and reuse of vacant or derelict properties, thereby helping to reduce the number of vacant properties and the associated social and economic problems. The grant is typically available to homeowners and tenants who are willing to undertake the refurbishment work themselves, with some assistance from local authorities or other organizations.",

The only provision in Irish law is under sections 113 and 113A of the Succession Act 1965 (as amended) where a spouse or a civil partner can renounce his/her legal right share in a pre-nuptial agreement. Although they are not legally binding, there is nothing in Irish law which stops a couple planning to marry from having and signing a pre-nuptial agreement. Importantly, such agreements can serve as guides for the courts in judicial separation and divorce cases. If a pre-nuptial agreement makes \u2018proper provision\u2019 for each person it is more likely to be persuasive on the judge.
