Lack of work: for example, your employer no longer needs or has a reduced need for employees with your skills or new technology has made your job unnecessary.

This repetition is not just for the sake of repetition, but serves a purpose in conveying meaning, creating a sense of rhythm, or evoking a particular emotional response. For example, in the phrase \"We shall fight on the beaches, in the streets, and in the fields,\" the repetition of \"in the\" emphasizes the scope of the resistance and creates a sense of determination.\n\nIn contrast, mere repetition without any clear purpose or effect is not considered genuine redundancy. For instance, repeating a word or phrase simply because it sounds good or is easy to say is not considered redundant.",

The only provision in Irish law is under sections 113 and 113A of the Succession Act 1965 (as amended) where a spouse or a civil partner can renounce his/her legal right share in a pre-nuptial agreement. Although they are not legally binding, there is nothing in Irish law which stops a couple planning to marry from having and signing a pre-nuptial agreement. Importantly, such agreements can serve as guides for the courts in judicial separation and divorce cases. If a pre-nuptial agreement makes \u2018proper provision\u2019 for each person it is more likely to be persuasive on the judge.

In the United States, for example, pre-nuptial agreements are recognized as valid under the Uniform Marriage and Divorce Act (UMDA) and are enforceable in most states. However, the enforceability of pre-nuptial agreements can be affected by factors such as the level of disclosure, the fairness of the agreement, and the existence of duress or coercion.",
