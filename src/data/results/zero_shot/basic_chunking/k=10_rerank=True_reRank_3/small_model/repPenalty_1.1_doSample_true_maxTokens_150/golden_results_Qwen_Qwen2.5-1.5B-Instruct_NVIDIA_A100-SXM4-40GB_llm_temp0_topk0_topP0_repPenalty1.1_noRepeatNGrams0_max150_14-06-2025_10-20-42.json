            "question": "Who is entitled to Irish citizenship?",
            "answer": "The entitlement to Irish citizenship can vary based on one's parents' nationality and place of birth. If a person has Irish ancestry, they may be eligible for naturalization or citizenship by descent. However, if both parents are citizens of another country, the child does not automatically acquire Irish citizenship unless certain conditions are met. For example, children born in Ireland have full Irish citizenship regardless of their parents' nationalities.\nIn summary, individuals with Irish heritage or who were born in Ireland are generally entitled to Irish citizenship under normal circumstances. However, complex rules apply depending on the specific family situation and historical context. The eligibility criteria are detailed in the laws governing citizenship in Ireland.",

In many jurisdictions, having an ordinary residence can affect one\u2019s eligibility for certain benefits such as social security payments, inheritance laws, and voting rights. The determination of an ordinary residence typically involves assessing factors like long-term habit, financial ties, and personal preference regarding which location is considered permanent.",

It can also be used to renovate vacant and derelict properties that have not been used as residential properties before. However, this only applies if the non-residential properties were used for commercial or public use before and now have the correct planning permission. You can get the grant if you are refurbishing the vacant property so you can live there, or so you can rent the property out. You can get a grant of up to \u20ac50,000 to renovate a vacant property and up to \u20ac70,000, if the property is derelict. You can get more if you are living on an off-shore island. And, there is an additional grant for expert conservation advice if you are refurbishing a vacant traditional farmhouse. The Vacant Property Refurbishment Grant is funded by the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage through the Cro\u00ed C\u00f3naithe (Towns) Fund and you apply to your local authority. If you have questions about the grant or want to know if your property qualifies, you can: Read the FAQs about the grant Contact the Vacant Homes Officer in your local authority Contact the Housing Agency's Vacancy Helpline on vacancycampaign@housingagency.ie You can also find information on how to re-use old and vacant buildings in the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage\u2019s Bringing Back Homes (pdf) manual.",
            "question": "What is the Vacant Property Refurbishment Grant?",
            "answer": "The Vacant Property Refurbishment Grant (VPRG) is a government program in Ontario, Canada that provides financial assistance to homeowners who want to improve their vacant properties. The goal of this grant is to help revitalize neighbourhoods by increasing property values and creating jobs. To qualify for VPRG funding, applicants must own a vacant property in an eligible area, have a plan to refurbish it, and demonstrate that they will use at least 20% of the funds for labour costs or materials. Applications are reviewed on a case-by-case basis, and approval rates can vary depending on the availability of funds.",

This means that if you have a pre-nuptial agreement in place and you end up in court following the breakdown of your marriage, the judge is not bound by the terms of the pre-nuptial agreement. The only provision in Irish law is under sections 113 and 113A of the Succession Act 1965 (as amended) where a spouse or a civil partner can renounce his/her legal right share in a pre-nuptial agreement. Although they are not legally binding, there is nothing in Irish law which stops a couple planning to marry from having and signing a pre-nuptial agreement. Importantly, such agreements can serve as guides for the courts in judicial separation and divorce cases. If a pre-nuptial agreement makes \u2018proper provision\u2019 for each person it is more likely to be persuasive on the judge. Therefore, in situations where one party is likely to inherit a significant family farm or business, it will guide the judge in the divorce or judicial separation on what the parties\u2019 intentions were at the outset.",

However, the specific legal status can vary depending on the country or region where the agreement is made and executed. In some places, such agreements may be enforceable if certain conditions are met, while in others, they might not have any legal effect at all. It's important for individuals considering a pre-nuptial agreement to consult with an attorney who specializes in family law to understand the local laws and how the agreement will be treated. The legality of these contracts often depends on factors like whether both parties voluntarily entered into them without coercion and whether there were clear terms that each party agreed upon.",
