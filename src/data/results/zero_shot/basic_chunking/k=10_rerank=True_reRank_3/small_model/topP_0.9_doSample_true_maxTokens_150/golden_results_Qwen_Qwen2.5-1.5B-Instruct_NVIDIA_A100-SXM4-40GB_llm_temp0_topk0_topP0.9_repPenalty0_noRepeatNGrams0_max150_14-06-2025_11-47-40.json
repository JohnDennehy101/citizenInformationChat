It can be an apartment, house, or any other dwelling unit that serves as the main home for a specific individual. This concept is important in legal and tax contexts because it helps determine which state has jurisdiction over certain matters related to property taxes, estate planning, and residency requirements. In many jurisdictions, individuals must meet residency requirements before claiming certain benefits, such as healthcare services or social security payments. The exact definition and criteria for what constitutes an \"ordinary residence\" may vary by country or region, but generally, it involves spending substantial time at one location compared to others.",

            "question": "What is the Vacant Property Refurbishment Grant?",
            "answer": "The Vacant Property Refurbishment Grant (VPRG) is a program that provides funding for individuals and organizations to refurbish vacant properties in their community. The grant aims to revitalize neighborhoods by improving property values, creating jobs, and promoting economic development. It offers grants of up to $50,000 per project, with eligible applicants including homeowners, nonprofit groups, and local governments. The process typically involves applying through local government agencies or non-profits, which then submit proposals to receive funding based on criteria such as property condition, location, and proposed improvements. This initiative encourages investment in underutilized spaces while addressing social issues like homelessness and unemployment.",

The only provision in Irish law is under sections 113 and 113A of the Succession Act 1965 (as amended) where a spouse or a civil partner can renounce his/her legal right share in a pre-nuptial agreement. Although they are not legally binding, there is nothing in Irish law which stops a couple planning to marry from having and signing a pre-nuptial agreement. Importantly, such agreements can serve as guides for the courts in judicial separation and divorce cases. If a pre-nuptial agreement makes \u2018proper provision\u2019 for each person it is more likely to be persuasive on the judge.

These agreements have been gaining popularity over recent years due to their ability to provide clarity and reduce conflict during marital dissolution.\nThe legality of pre-nuptial agreements varies by jurisdiction. In some places, they may not be enforceable at all; in others, they might only be valid if certain conditions are met. Generally, these agreements need to meet specific legal requirements, such as being entered into voluntarily by both parties without undue influence from each other, and including provisions that address equitable distribution of assets.",
