Lack of work: for example, your employer no longer needs or has a reduced need for employees with your skills or new technology has made your job unnecessary.

It can also be used to renovate vacant and derelict properties that have not been used as residential properties before. However, this only applies if the non-residential properties were used for commercial or public use before and now have the correct planning permission. You can get the grant if you are refurbishing the vacant property so you can live there, or so you can rent the property out. You can get a grant of up to \u20ac50,000 to renovate a vacant property and up to \u20ac70,000, if the property is derelict. You can get more if you are living on an off-shore island. And, there is an additional grant for expert conservation advice if you are refurbishing a vacant traditional farmhouse.

However, they must provide you with adequate notice and allow sufficient time for planning and preparation before the required days off.\nThe answer provided is correct but could be expanded for clarity and detail. Here's a more detailed version:\n\nYour employer has the right to request that employees take their annual leave, but there are several important legal considerations involved in this process:\n\n1. **Notice Period**: Employers generally need to give advance notice of the dates on which an employee will be absent from work due to annual leave. This ensures that employers have enough time to manage their schedules accordingly and that employees have ample time to prepare themselves for the absence.\n\n2. **Reasonableness**: The notice period should not be unreasonable or overly burdensome. Courts often consider whether the requested amount of notice is reasonable in light of the circumstances surrounding the employee\u2019s job duties and responsibilities.\n\n3. **Legal Requirements**: In some jurisdictions, such as Canada, Australia, and New Zealand, there may be specific laws governing the timing and content of notice periods related to taking leave. These requirements help protect both the employer and the employee by ensuring fair treatment during absences.\n\n4. **Employee Rights**: Employees also have rights under employment law regarding the length of notice required for taking leave. For example, in many countries, including the United States, the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) requires employers to provide 12 weeks of unpaid leave per year for certain family and medical reasons.\n\n5. **Alternative Work Schedules**: To mitigate any disruption caused by leaving early, employers might offer alternative arrangements such as temporary transfers to other departments within the same company or temporary hiring of additional staff to cover shifts.\n\n6. **Non-Compete Clauses**: If an employee takes extended leave without cause, employers may seek to enforce non-compete clauses to prevent the employee from working in competition with the company. It's crucial for employees to review these agreements carefully before accepting them.\n\nIn summary, while employers do have the authority to require annual leave, it is essential for both parties to adhere to reasonable practices and ensure that the process respects all relevant legal obligations.

This means that if you have a pre-nuptial agreement in place and you end up in court following the breakdown of your marriage, the judge is not bound by the terms of the pre-nuptial agreement. The only provision in Irish law is under sections 113 and 113A of the Succession Act 1965 (as amended) where a spouse or a civil partner can renounce his/her legal right share in a pre-nuptial agreement. Although they are not legally binding, there is nothing in Irish law which stops a couple planning to marry from having and signing a pre-nuptial agreement. Importantly, such agreements can serve as guides for the courts in judicial separation and divorce cases. If a pre-nuptial agreement makes \u2018proper provision\u2019 for each person it is more likely to be persuasive on the judge.

It allows employees to purchase a new or used bike for work at no cost from participating employers, provided they have valid health insurance cover.\nThis scheme has been widely praised for its effectiveness in promoting cycling among workers, reducing traffic congestion and air pollution, and providing an alternative form of transport that can be more environmentally friendly than driving alone. The scheme also provides financial incentives for companies to invest in their staff's health and well-being through the provision of affordable workplace cycles.\nWhile there are some criticisms about the scheme being expensive for employers, it remains one of the most successful initiatives in terms of promoting healthy lifestyles and sustainable transportation options in the UK.

            "raw_answer": "Use your existing knowledge to answer the question.\n\nQuestion: What are the operating hours and frequency of the Luas?\n\nHelpful Answer:\nThe Luas, a Dublin bus system, operates 24 hours a day with services running every five minutes during peak hours (6am - 9pm) and every ten minutes off-peak. The Luas is operated by DART, which stands for Dublin Area Rapid Transit. It's worth noting that while it doesn't explicitly state this in its official operations information, the Luas is often considered part of the DART network due to their similar service areas and schedules. If you're looking for specific details on Luas schedules or any changes, I'd recommend checking the official DART website or contacting their customer support directly. They should be able to provide up-to-date information about current routes, times, and any ongoing maintenance or disruptions. Additionally, if you're planning a trip using the Luas, consider using real-time transit apps like Google Maps or Citymapper for more precise travel options and predictions based on traffic conditions. These tools can help you plan your journey efficiently even when traditional printed schedules might not always reflect the most accurate real-time data.
