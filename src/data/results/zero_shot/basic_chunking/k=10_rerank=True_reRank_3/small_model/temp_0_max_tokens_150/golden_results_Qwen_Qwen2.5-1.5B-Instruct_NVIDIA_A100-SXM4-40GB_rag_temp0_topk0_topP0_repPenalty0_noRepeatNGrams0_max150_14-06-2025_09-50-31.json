Here's a breakdown of the key points:\n\n- **Birthplace**: Most Irish citizens were automatically Irish when they were born before January 1, 2005. After that date, only those born in Ireland or Northern Ireland before that date qualify.\n  \n- **Parental Citizenship**: If either parent was Irish or British at the time of birth, or if one parent was an Irish or British citizen and died before the child was born, the child might be eligible for Irish citizenship.",

Lack of work: for example, your employer no longer needs or has a reduced need for employees with your skills or new technology has made your job unnecessary. Reorganisation within the business: for example, your employer has decided to carry on the business with fewer or no staff or the job you do no longer exists.

The burden of proof is on your employer to show that a legitimate redundancy situation exists and that therefore the dismissal is fair.

It can also be used to renovate vacant and derelict properties that have not been used as residential properties before. However, this only applies if the non-residential properties were used for commercial or public use before and now have the correct planning permission. You can get the grant if you are refurbishing the vacant property so you can live there, or so you can rent the property out. You can get a grant of up to \u20ac50,000 to renovate a vacant property and up to \u20ac70,000, if the property is derelict. You can get more if you are living on an off-shore island. And, there is an additional grant for expert conservation advice if you are refurbishing a vacant traditional farmhouse. The Vacant Property Refurbishment Grant is funded by the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage through the Cro\u00ed C\u00f3naithe (Towns) Fund and you apply to your local authority.

The only provision in Irish law is under sections 113 and 113A of the Succession Act 1965 (as amended) where a spouse or a civil partner can renounce his/her legal right share in a pre-nuptial agreement. Although they are not legally binding, there is nothing in Irish law which stops a couple planning to marry from having and signing a pre-nuptial agreement. Importantly, such agreements can serve as guides for the courts in judicial separation and divorce cases. If a pre-nuptial agreement makes \u2018proper provision\u2019 for each person it is more likely to be persuasive on the judge.

Employers can choose to buy these items up to a maximum value of \u20ac3,000 per employee, which can be repaid from the employee's gross salary. The repayment period typically ranges from one to three years, depending on the type of bike purchased.
