A genuine redundancy is one where your employer has a real business reason to make you redundant.

Lack of work: for example, your employer no longer needs or has a reduced need for employees with your skills or new technology has made your job unnecessary. Reorganisation within the business: for example, your employer has decided to carry on the business with fewer or no staff or the job you do no longer exists. Business closure: the business is closing down or moving.",
            "question": "What counts as genuine redundancy?",
            "answer": "Genuine redundancy is when an employee's job is eliminated due to a change in business strategy or restructuring, and they are given notice of their termination. This process involves providing employees with adequate time to find new employment before being laid off. It also includes ensuring that all necessary paperwork is completed and that any benefits owed to the terminated employee are properly addressed. The goal is to minimize disruption for both the employee and the company while still adhering to legal requirements. \n\nThis definition clarifies what constitutes genuine redundancy by emphasizing the need for proper notice periods, documentation, and benefit considerations during the transition from one role to another within an organization. It underscores the importance of treating such terminations fairly and transparently to maintain trust between employers and employees.",

And, there is an additional grant for expert conservation advice if you are refurbishing a vacant traditional farmhouse. The Vacant Property Refurbishment Grant is funded by the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage through the Cro\u00ed C\u00f3naithe (Towns) Fund and you apply to your local authority. If you have questions about the grant or want to know if your property qualifies, you can: Read the FAQs about the grant Contact the Vacant Homes Officer in your local authority Contact the Housing Agency's Vacancy Helpline on vacancycampaign@housingagency.ie You can also find information on how to re-use old and vacant buildings in the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage\u2019s Bringing Back Homes (pdf) manual.",

            "answer": "The Vacant Property Refurbishment Grant (VPRG) is a program that provides grants for property owners who want to renovate and improve their vacant properties. The grant funds can be used for a variety of purposes, such as purchasing materials or equipment, hiring contractors, or making repairs to the structure. The VPRG was established by the California State Legislature in 2013 with the goal of revitalizing blighted areas and creating jobs through property improvement projects.\nTo qualify for the VPRG, applicants must meet certain eligibility requirements, including owning at least one-third of the property's value, having a valid business license, and being able to demonstrate a financial need for the grant funds.",

Points are deducted from a driver's record, which affects their driving privileges and costs associated with operating a vehicle.

This means that if you have a pre-nuptial agreement in place and you end up in court following the breakdown of your marriage, the judge is not bound by the terms of the pre-nuptial agreement. The only provision in Irish law is under sections 113 and 113A of the Succession Act 1965 (as amended) where a spouse or a civil partner can renounce his/her legal right share in a pre-nuptial agreement. Although they are not legally binding, there is nothing in Irish law which stops a couple planning to marry from having and signing a pre-nuptial agreement. Importantly, such agreements can serve as guides for the courts in judicial separation and divorce cases. If a pre-nuptial agreement makes \u2018proper provision\u2019 for each person it is more likely to be persuasive on the judge.

In many jurisdictions, pre-nuptial agreements must be fair and equitable, meaning they should not unfairly benefit one spouse over the other.
