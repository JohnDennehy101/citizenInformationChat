It can also be used to renovate vacant and derelict properties that have not been used as residential properties before. However, this only applies if the non-residential properties were used for commercial or public use before and now have the correct planning permission. You can get the grant if you are refurbishing the vacant property so you can live there, or so you can rent the property out. You can get a grant of up to \u20ac50,000 to renovate a vacant property and up to \u20ac70,000, if the property is derelict. You can get more if you are living on an off-shore island. And, there is an additional grant for expert conservation advice if you are refurbishing a vacant traditional farmhouse. The Vacant Property Refurbishment Grant is funded by the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage through the Cro\u00ed C\u00f3naithe (Towns) Fund and you apply to your local authority. If you have questions about the grant or want to know if your property qualifies, you can: Read the FAQs about the grant Contact the Vacant Homes Officer in your local authority Contact the Housing Agency's Vacancy Helpline on vacancycampaign@housingagency.ie You can also find information on how to re-use old and vacant buildings in the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage\u2019s Bringing Back Homes (pdf) manual.",

It allows residents to upgrade and improve their living spaces without having to tear down and rebuild. The grant covers various types of work like demolition, substructure, superstructure, external and internal completions, skirtings, fascias, soffits, roof finishes, tiling, painting, plumbing, heating, and other essential services. The total amount varies depending on the size and condition of the property, but it typically ranges from \u20ac50,000 to \u20ac70,000, inclusive of VAT. The grant is designed to help people who want to make their empty homes livable again while keeping them within budget constraints.",
