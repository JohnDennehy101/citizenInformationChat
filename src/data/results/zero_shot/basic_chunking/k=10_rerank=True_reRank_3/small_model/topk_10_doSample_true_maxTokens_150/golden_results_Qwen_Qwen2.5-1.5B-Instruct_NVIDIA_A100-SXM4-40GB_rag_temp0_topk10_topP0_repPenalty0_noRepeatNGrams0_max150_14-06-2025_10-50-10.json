You can get the grant if you are refurbishing the vacant property so you can live there, or so you can rent the property out. You can get a grant of up to \u20ac50,000 to renovate a vacant property and up to \u20ac70,000, if the property is derelict. You can get more if you are living on an off-shore island.

            "answer": "The Cycle to Work Scheme is a government-funded program designed to help employees afford new bicycles and associated safety equipment by allowing employers to provide these items without charging the employee any additional cost. Under this scheme, an employer can purchase a bicycle and its accessories at a set maximum price, typically up to \u20ac3,000 for most types of bicycles. The employee then repays the cost of the bike and safety gear from their own salary, with no tax, national insurance contributions, or universal social charge being withheld from their earnings. Employers who participate in this scheme may receive a rebate for each cycle purchased under their name. Additionally, there are specific rules regarding what types of cycles qualify under the scheme and how many times one can apply.",
