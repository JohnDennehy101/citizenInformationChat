            "answer": "Irish citizens are those who have been born in Ireland, or whose parents were Irish citizens. Additionally, Irish citizenship can be acquired through naturalization by persons of foreign birth who meet certain requirements, such as having lived in Ireland for a period specified by law and passing an English language test. Furthermore, Irish citizenship may also be granted to children of Irish fathers and mothers living abroad, provided that they were born in Ireland or during their mother's residence there before age 16. It is important to note that while these conditions exist, they do not guarantee automatic citizenship; instead, individuals must apply for citizenship if they wish to become one. This process involves submitting an application along with required documentation and undergoing a background check.",

However, this only applies if the non-residential properties were used for commercial or public use before and now have the correct planning permission. You can get the grant if you are refurbishing the vacant property so you can live there, or so you can rent the property out. You can get a grant of up to \u20ac50,000 to renovate a vacant property and up to \u20ac70,000, if the property is derelict. You can get more if you are living on an off-shore island. And, there is an additional grant for expert conservation advice if you are refurbishing a vacant traditional farmhouse. The Vacant Property Refurbishment Grant is funded by the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage through the Cro\u00ed C\u00f3naithe (Towns) Fund and you apply to your local authority. If you have questions about the grant or want to know if your property qualifies, you can: Read the FAQs about the grant Contact the Vacant Homes Officer in your local authority Contact the Housing Agency's Vacancy Helpline on vacancycampaign@housingagency.ie You can also find information on how to re-use old and vacant buildings in the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage\u2019s Bringing Back Homes (pdf) manual.",
            "question": "What is the Vacant Property Refurbishment Grant?",
            "answer": "The Vacant Property Refurbishment Grant (VPRG) was a federal program that provided funding for the renovation and rehabilitation of vacant properties in low-income communities. The goal was to increase housing availability, improve property conditions, and promote economic development.\nTo be eligible for VPRG funds, applicants must meet certain criteria such as having a local sponsor who agrees to manage the project on their behalf, providing proof of need for affordable housing, and demonstrating financial feasibility for the proposed improvements.\nFunding levels were based on several factors including the size and condition of the property, its location within the community, and the extent of necessary repairs or renovations required. Grants typically ranged from $50,000 to $1 million per project.",

This means that if you have a pre-nuptial agreement in place and you end up in court following the breakdown of your marriage, the judge is not bound by the terms of the pre-nuptial agreement. The only provision in Irish law is under sections 113 and 113A of the Succession Act 1965 (as amended) where a spouse or a civil partner can renounce his/her legal right share in a pre-nuptial agreement. Although they are not legally binding, there is nothing in Irish law which stops a couple planning to marry from having and signing a pre-nuptial agreement. Importantly, such agreements can serve as guides for the courts in judicial separation and divorce cases. If a pre-nuptial agreement makes \u2018proper provision\u2019 for each person it is more likely to be persuasive on the judge.

However, they must meet certain requirements under state law to be enforceable. In general, courts typically recognize these agreements when they are fair and based on mutual agreement between the spouses.
