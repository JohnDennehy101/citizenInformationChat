Lack of work: for example, your employer no longer needs or has a reduced need for employees with your skills or new technology has made your job unnecessary.

            "answer": "Genuine redundancy occurs when an employee is dismissed because their role no longer exists or has been eliminated. It's a situation where there are fewer positions available than employees, leading to layoffs. This type of redundancy can be distinguished from other types of dismissal by its necessity and inevitability due to organizational restructuring or downsizing.\n\nThis definition highlights that genuine redundancies require specific conditions such as:\n\n- **Role Elimination**: The job position must have ceased to exist.\n- Inevitableness**: There should be no alternative but for the employee to be laid off.\n- Organizational Context**: It arises from broader organizational changes rather than individual dissatisfaction or poor performance.",

This card may include personal information such as name, address, contact details, insurance information, allergies, medications, previous illnesses, etc., which helps the healthcare provider prepare for the consultation. It also allows the patient to quickly review any important notes or questions beforehand, making the appointment more efficient and less time-consuming for both the doctor and the person seeking care.\nGP visit cards are not a specific type of travel document issued by governments; instead, they serve as a tool for organizing patient information during routine medical visits.",

It can also be used to renovate vacant and derelict properties that have not been used as residential properties before. However, this only applies if the non-residential properties were used for commercial or public use before and now have the correct planning permission. You can get the grant if you are refurbishing the vacant property so you can live there, or so you can rent the property out. You can get a grant of up to \u20ac50,000 to renovate a vacant property and up to \u20ac70,000, if the property is derelict. You can get more if you are living on an off-shore island. And, there is an additional grant for expert conservation advice if you are refurbishing a vacant traditional farmhouse. The Vacant Property Refurbishment Grant is funded by the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage through the Cro\u00ed C\u00f3naithe (Towns) Fund and you apply to your local authority. If you have questions about the grant or want to know if your property qualifies, you can: Read the FAQs about the grant Contact the Vacant Homes Officer in your local authority Contact the Housing Agency's Vacancy Helpline on vacancycampaign@housingagency.ie You can also find information on how to re-use old and vacant buildings in the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage\u2019s Bringing Back Homes (pdf) manual.",

However, they cannot force you beyond what is required by law or company policy. Employers are generally allowed to set policies that mandate employees take their PTO within a reasonable period of time after accrual and expiration, but not beyond it. The key point here is that an employer cannot compel you past what's permitted under federal labor laws or internal corporate guidelines regarding employee benefits and absences. For example, if your company requires 12 weeks of PTP, then that's the maximum number of days you must use before being considered late in taking time away from work for personal reasons.",

The only provision in Irish law is under sections 113 and 113A of the Succession Act 1965 (as amended) where a spouse or a civil partner can renounce his/her legal right share in a pre-nuptial agreement. Although they are not legally binding, there is nothing in Irish law which stops a couple planning to marry from having and signing a pre-nuptial agreement. Importantly, such agreements can serve as guides for the courts in judicial separation and divorce cases. If a pre-nuptial agreement makes \u2018proper provision\u2019 for each person it is more likely to be persuasive on the judge.
