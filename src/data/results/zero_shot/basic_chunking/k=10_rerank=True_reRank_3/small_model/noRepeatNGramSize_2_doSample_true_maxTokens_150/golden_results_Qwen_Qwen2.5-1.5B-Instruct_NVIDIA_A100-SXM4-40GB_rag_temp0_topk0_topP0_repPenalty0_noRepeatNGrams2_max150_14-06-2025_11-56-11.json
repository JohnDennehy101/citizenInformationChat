Individuals typically establish their primary place or base of operations in their foreign country of citizenship or residence, indicating they consider it their home away from home for extended periods.

When considering tax residency, individuals must ensure they meet the criteria set out by the relevant governing bodies, including having spent sufficient time in-country to satisfy the residency requirements for their chosen jurisdiction.",

You can get the grant if you are refurbishing the vacant property so you can live there, or so you can rent the property out. You can get a grant of up to \u20ac50,000 to renovate a vacant property and up to \u20ac70,000, if the property is derelict. You can get more if you are living on an off-shore island. And, there is an additional grant for expert conservation advice if you are refurbishing a vacant traditional farmhouse. The Vacant Property Refurbishment Grant is funded by the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage through the Cro\u00ed C\u00f3naithe (Towns) Fund and you apply to your local authority.

The only provision in Irish law is under sections 113 and 113A of the Succession Act 1965 (as amended) where a spouse or a civil partner can renounce his/her legal right share in a pre-nuptial agreement. Although they are not legally binding, there is nothing in Irish law which stops a couple planning to marry from having and signing a pre-nuptial agreement.

If a pre-nuptial agreement makes \u2018proper provision\u2019 for each person it is more likely to be persuasive on the judge.

            "question": "What is the legal status of pre-nuptial agreements?",
            "answer": "Pre- nuptual agreements are agreements between a man and woman that are made before they get married to deal with money issues if they decide to split up later on. These agreements aren't legally required or binding in most places, so even though they're written down, judges don't have them to follow when deciding things like how to divide up the house or money after a divorce. But sometimes lawyers say that pre- marriages help judges think better about what happened at first, especially when one person inherits lots of money or owns important stuff. However, because they aren\u2019t officially law, courts won't always use them as much when making decisions.",

Document 5 lists various bodies involved in aviation regulation across different jurisdictions, but none specifically states that Ireland's aviation authority is called the \"Ireland Aviation Administration\" or \"Irlande de l'Aviation.\" Instead, Document A mentions the Departments of Transportation and Defense which regulate military aviation, while Document B identifies the National Aviation Regulatory Agency as the governing entity in France. \n\nTherefore, based on available documentation, there isn't enough evidence pointing to a specific name like \"National Aviation Administrative Authority\" being used to describe Ireland\u2019s aviation regulatory body.",
