For instance, a married couple, a couple living together in a civil partnership, or someone who has been cohabitating for at least three years without marriage or civil partnership can qualify as adopters. To ensure eligibility, individuals should consult with a lawyer specialized in intercountry adoption. Also, it's important to note that only couples can adopt; single individuals cannot adopt directly. The Adoption Authority assesses these qualifications and makes recommendations based on individual circumstances. Individuals seeking to adopt must also undergo background checks and provide proof of their ability to support the child financially.",

The only provision in Irish law is under sections 113 and 113A of the Succession Act 1965 (as amended) where a spouse or a civil partner can renounce his/her legal right share in a pre-nuptial agreement. Although they are not legally binding, there is nothing in Irish law which stops a couple planning to marry from having and signing a pre-nuptial agreement. Importantly, such agreements can serve as guides for the courts in judicial separation and divorce cases. If a pre-nuptial agreement makes \u2018proper provision\u2019 for each person it is more likely to be persuasive on the judge.

            "ground_truth": "Under the Cycle to Work Scheme (also known as the Bike to Work Scheme), you can get a new bike tax free through your work. Your employer pays for a new bike and then you repay the cost of regular instalments from your gross (overall) salary. You do not have to pay tax, PRSI or the Universal Social Charge on your repayments. Not every employer takes part in the scheme. However, if they do, they must offer it to all their employees. If you are self-employed, you cannot take part in the Cycle to Work Scheme unless you pay PRSI as an employee in addition to your self-employed work.",
            "question": "What is the Cycle to Work Scheme?",
            "answer": "The Cycle to Work Scheme is a program that allows employers to provide employees with a new bike and associated bike safety equipment at no cost to the employee. The employee can then repay the cost of the equipment over time from their gross salary.\nBased on this passage, we can infer that the Cycle to Work Scheme involves:\n\n- Employers providing employees with a new bike\n- Employees repaying the cost of the bike and safety equipment from their gross salary \n- Bikes being provided at no cost to the employee\n- Safety equipment being included in the purchase price\n- Employees paying back the cost of the equipment over time\n- The cost of the bike and equipment being limited to \u20ac3,000 for cargo and ecargo bikes, \u20ac1,500 for pedelecs and e-bikes, and \u20ac1,250 for other bikes. \n\nIt also mentions that the cycle to work scheme has been extended until the end of 2022.",
