This concept can be relevant in various contexts, such as real estate transactions or legal matters involving property rights.\nTo elaborate further:\n\n- Real Estate Transactions: In the context of buying or selling properties, the term \"ordinary residence\" often determines which property is considered the primary residence (or first house) for tax purposes. For example, if someone purchases a second home but intends it primarily as a vacation destination, this might affect how taxes are calculated on their other homes.\n\n- Legal Matters: In cases involving property disputes or inheritance laws, knowing whether someone has an \"ordinary residence\" helps determine jurisdictional rules regarding ownership and transfer of property.\n\n- Insurance Policies: Some insurance policies may require proof of a specific type of dwelling, such as having an \"ordinary residence\" as one's main living space.",

A genuine redundancy is one where your employer has a real business reason to make you redundant. Reasons for redundancy include: Financial difficulties within the business: for example, your employer needs to cut costs and this means staff numbers must be reduced. Lack of work: for example, your employer no longer needs or has a reduced need for employees with your skills or new technology has made your job unnecessary. Reorganisation within the business: for example, your employer has decided to carry on the business with fewer or no staff or the job you do no longer exists.

            "question": "What counts as genuine redundancy?",
            "answer": "Genuine redundancy is a term used in employment law. It refers to situations where an employee's job role has been eliminated due to business reasons, such as downsizing or restructuring of the company. The employee is then given notice and may be offered alternative positions within the same company or transferred to another department. This process ensures that all employees affected by organizational changes are treated fairly and their jobs are not taken away without proper compensation. In contrast, \"fake\" redundancy often occurs when companies terminate employees for personal reasons unrelated to business needs, leading to disputes over fairness and compensation. Genuine redundancy involves transparent communication, fair treatment, and respect for legal rights during layoff processes.",

This means that if you have a pre-nuptial agreement in place and you end up in court following the breakdown of your marriage, the judge is not bound by the terms of the pre-nuptial agreement. The only provision in Irish law is under sections 113 and 113A of the Succession Act 1965 (as amended) where a spouse or a civil partner can renounce his/her legal right share in a pre-nuptial agreement. Although they are not legally binding, there is nothing in Irish law which stops a couple planning to marry from having and signing a pre-nuptial agreement. Importantly, such agreements can serve as guides for the courts in judicial separation and divorce cases. If a pre-nuptial agreement makes \u2018proper provision\u2019 for each person it is more likely to be persuasive on the judge. Therefore, in situations where one party is likely to inherit a significant family farm or business, it will guide the judge in the divorce or judicial separation on what the parties\u2019 intentions were at the outset.",

They are typically signed before marriage and can include provisions for alimony, child support, and division of assets. However, their validity varies by jurisdiction; some states require a formal process and notarization, while others may allow them without such requirements. It's important for individuals considering these agreements to consult with an attorney familiar with their state's laws regarding prenups. The legality of pre-nuptial agreements hinges on specific statutes enacted at the local, state, or federal level, which must be adhered to in order for them to be considered valid and enforceable. \n\nAnswering this question requires understanding the legal framework surrounding pre-nuptial agreements, including where they are permitted, what information must be included, and whether there are any statutory requirements.",

            "question": "Who regulates aviation in Ireland?",
            "answer": "The Civil Aviation Authority of Ireland (CAA) is responsible for regulating aviation in Ireland. It was established on 1 January 2014 as a result of the Civil Aviation Act 2013, which replaced the Irish Air Navigation Services Agency (IANSA), which had been operating since 1978.\nThe CAA has primary responsibility for ensuring that all aircraft and air navigation services operate safely in accordance with international standards and guidelines set out by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO).\nIn addition to safety regulation, the CAA also has oversight responsibilities over the development and implementation of air traffic control systems, airport operations, and the certification of aviation equipment and personnel. The authority is also involved in the enforcement of regulations related to airspace management, environmental protection, and the promotion of sustainable aviation practices.\nDoes this information help you understand who regulates aviation in Ireland? Let me know if you have any further questions!",

            "ground_truth": "Under the Cycle to Work Scheme (also known as the Bike to Work Scheme), you can get a new bike tax free through your work. Your employer pays for a new bike and then you repay the cost of regular instalments from your gross (overall) salary. You do not have to pay tax, PRSI or the Universal Social Charge on your repayments. Not every employer takes part in the scheme. However, if they do, they must offer it to all their employees. If you are self-employed, you cannot take part in the Cycle to Work Scheme unless you pay PRSI as an employee in addition to your self-employed work.",
            "question": "What is the Cycle to Work Scheme?",
            "answer": "The Cycle to Work Scheme, also known as the Cycle to Job scheme, was a government-backed incentive program in the UK designed to encourage employees to purchase and use personal cycle equipment. It allowed employees to claim a portion of the cost of their chosen cycle equipment from their employer if they chose to buy it through a local bike shop. The goal was to reduce carbon emissions by promoting cycling for short journeys.\nIn essence, this scheme provided an opportunity for individuals to benefit financially from purchasing eco-friendly transportation options, thereby encouraging sustainable commuting practices among workers. This initiative aimed to make cycling more accessible and attractive to employees while supporting public health initiatives that advocate for physical activity and environmental conservation. By linking employee benefits with green living choices, the Cycle to Work Scheme sought to create a win-win situation where both employers and employees could contribute positively towards achieving sustainability goals.",

In addition, there are electronic displays and announcements informing passengers of the next stop on board every tram. Special services operate during Christmas, New Year and on other occasions.",
            "question": "What are the operating hours and frequency of the Luas?",
            "answer": "The Luas, or Dublin Bus service, operates on a 24-hour schedule. However, due to the nature of its route network, there can be times when it may not operate at full capacity. For example, some routes only run during certain times of day or weekends. Additionally, peak travel periods such as rush hour (typically from 7:30 am to 10:00 am and 4:00 pm to 6:30 pm) see higher usage and consequently reduced frequencies. It's advisable to check the official Luas website for real-time information about services and schedules before traveling. The Luas runs approximately every 5-10 minutes along most lines in the city center, but this frequency can vary depending on demand and route length. There is also a shuttle bus that connects the Luas and other forms of public transport, providing additional options for travelers.",
