This can be contrasted with a vacation home or rental property that someone may use occasionally. The concept is important in legal contexts, such as determining residency requirements for voting or tax purposes.\nYou are correct! An ordinary residence typically refers to a person's primary, long-term dwelling place where they spend most of their time. It's the location where someone feels comfortable, has accumulated possessions, and considers themselves to be at home. For example, if you've been living in New York City for many years and consider it your regular place of residence, then New York City would be considered your ordinary residence.",

You can get a grant of up to \u20ac50,000 to renovate a vacant property and up to \u20ac70,000, if the property is derelict. You can get more if you are living on an off-shore island. And, there is an additional grant for expert conservation advice if you are refurbishing a vacant traditional farmhouse. The Vacant Property Refurbishment Grant is funded by the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage through the Cro\u00ed C\u00f3naithe (Towns) Fund and you apply to your local authority. If you have questions about the grant or want to know if your property qualifies, you can: Read the FAQs about the grant Contact the Vacant Homes Officer in your local authority Contact the Housing Agency's Vacancy Helpline on vacancycampaign@housingagency.ie You can also find information on how to re-use old and vacant buildings in the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage\u2019s Bringing Back Homes (pdf) manual.",

The only provision in Irish law is under sections 113 and 113A of the Succession Act 1965 (as amended) where a spouse or a civil partner can renounce his/her legal right share in a pre-nuptial agreement. Although they are not legally binding, there is nothing in Irish law which stops a couple planning to marry from having and signing a pre-nuptial agreement.

            "question": "What are the operating hours and frequency of the Luas?",
            "answer": "The Luas, a Dublin bus system, operates on an hourly schedule from 5am until midnight. It's important to note that there may be occasional delays or cancellations due to weather conditions or other factors. For up-to-date information about current services, travelers can check the official Luas website or use their mobile app. The Luas is particularly popular during rush hour (6am-9am and 4pm-7pm), so it's wise to plan accordingly when traveling through the city. To avoid potential disruptions, it's advisable to make travel plans at least two days in advance, especially for longer journeys.",
