For example, if you live in New York City but spend summers in Florida, your summer home would likely be considered your ordinary residence.\n\n- Usual Place of Abode: This is the place where a person intends to return after being away from it temporarily. If you're on vacation in Hawaii and plan to return there next week, that would be your usual place of abode.",

A genuine redundancy is one where your employer has a real business reason to make you redundant. Reasons for redundancy include: Financial difficulties within the business: for example, your employer needs to cut costs and this means staff numbers must be reduced. Lack of work: for example, your employer no longer needs or has a reduced need for employees with your skills or new technology has made your job unnecessary. Reorganisation within the business: for example, your employer has decided to carry on the business with fewer or no staff or the job you do no longer exists. Business closure: the business is closing down or moving.",
            "question": "What counts as genuine redundancy?",
            "answer": "Genuine redundancy is when an employee's job is eliminated due to a change in business strategy or restructuring, and they are given notice of their termination. This process involves providing employees with adequate time to find new employment before being laid off. It also includes ensuring that all necessary paperwork is completed and that any benefits owed to the terminated employee are properly addressed. The goal is to minimize disruption for both the employee and the company while still adhering to legal requirements. \n\nThis definition clarifies what constitutes genuine redundancy by emphasizing the need for proper notice periods, documentation, and benefit considerations during the transition from one role to another within an organization. It underscores the importance of treating such terminations fairly and transparently to maintain trust between employers and employees. By focusing on these aspects, we can ensure that genuine redundancies do not lead to unfair treatment or unnecessary stress for those affected.",

It can also be used to renovate vacant and derelict properties that have not been used as residential properties before. However, this only applies if the non-residential properties were used for commercial or public use before and now have the correct planning permission. You can get the grant if you are refurbishing the vacant property so you can live there, or so you can rent the property out. You can get a grant of up to \u20ac50,000 to renovate a vacant property and up to \u20ac70,000, if the property is derelict. You can get more if you are living on an off-shore island. And, there is an additional grant for expert conservation advice if you are refurbishing a vacant traditional farmhouse. The Vacant Property Refurbishment Grant is funded by the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage through the Cro\u00ed C\u00f3naithe (Towns) Fund and you apply to your local authority.

            "answer": "The Vacant Property Refurbishment Grant (VPRG) is a program that provides grants for property owners who want to renovate and improve their vacant properties. The grant funds can be used for a variety of purposes, such as purchasing materials or equipment, hiring contractors, or making repairs to the structure. The VPRG was established by the California State Legislature in 2013 with the goal of revitalizing blighted areas and creating jobs through property improvement projects.\nTo qualify for the VPRG, applicants must meet certain eligibility requirements, including owning at least one-third of the property's value, having a valid business license, and being able to demonstrate a financial need for the grant funds. The maximum amount of funding available per project varies depending on factors such as the size of the property and the scope of the renovation work required.",

This means that if you have a pre-nuptial agreement in place and you end up in court following the breakdown of your marriage, the judge is not bound by the terms of the pre-nuptial agreement. The only provision in Irish law is under sections 113 and 113A of the Succession Act 1965 (as amended) where a spouse or a civil partner can renounce his/her legal right share in a pre-nuptial agreement. Although they are not legally binding, there is nothing in Irish law which stops a couple planning to marry from having and signing a pre-nuptial agreement. Importantly, such agreements can serve as guides for the courts in judicial separation and divorce cases. If a pre-nuptial agreement makes \u2018proper provision\u2019 for each person it is more likely to be persuasive on the judge.

These agreements can be used to outline how assets will be divided in case of a divorce or death during the marriage. They are typically made with the assistance of an attorney and often include provisions for alimony, child support, and property division. In many jurisdictions, pre-nuptial agreements must be fair and equitable, meaning they should not unfairly benefit one spouse over the other. However, some states have specific laws regarding their validity, such as requiring them to be signed by both parties voluntarily without coercion. It's important for individuals considering entering into a pre-nup to consult with a lawyer who specializes in family law to ensure it meets all necessary requirements and protections. The legality of pre-nuptial agreements varies widely across different countries and regions, so consulting local legal advice is crucial.",

            "ground_truth": "Under the Cycle to Work Scheme (also known as the Bike to Work Scheme), you can get a new bike tax free through your work. Your employer pays for a new bike and then you repay the cost of regular instalments from your gross (overall) salary. You do not have to pay tax, PRSI or the Universal Social Charge on your repayments. Not every employer takes part in the scheme. However, if they do, they must offer it to all their employees. If you are self-employed, you cannot take part in the Cycle to Work Scheme unless you pay PRSI as an employee in addition to your self-employed work.",
            "question": "What is the Cycle to Work Scheme?",
            "answer": "The Cycle to Work Scheme allows employees to purchase a new cycle or other health and fitness equipment for personal use, with no tax charge on the value of the item. The scheme was introduced in 2001 by the UK government as part of its commitment to encourage people to cycle more often.\nTo qualify for the scheme, an employee must be employed by a company that has signed up to the scheme. They can then choose from a range of products including cycles, exercise bikes, power meters, and safety gear. The maximum amount they can claim per year is \u00a3500, which includes VAT (Value Added Tax). This means that if someone buys a \u00a3400 bike through the scheme, only \u00a3100 would need to be paid out-of-pocket.\nThe scheme is designed to help reduce carbon emissions and improve public health by encouraging people to cycle instead of driving. It also provides financial incentives for companies to promote cycling among their staff.",
