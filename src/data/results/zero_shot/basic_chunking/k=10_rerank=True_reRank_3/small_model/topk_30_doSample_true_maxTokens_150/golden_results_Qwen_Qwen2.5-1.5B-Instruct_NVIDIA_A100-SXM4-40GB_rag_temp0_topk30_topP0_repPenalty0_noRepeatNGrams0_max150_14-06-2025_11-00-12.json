            "question": "What is ordinary residence?",
            "answer": "Ordinary residence is determined based on an individual's long-term patterns of residence across multiple years. It involves considering the overall duration spent in the relevant jurisdiction (in this case, Ireland) compared to the total number of years lived. An individual becomes considered ordinarily resident once they've met the criteria of spending three consecutive years in Ireland, or leaving the country for a period totaling three years while continuing to reside elsewhere. The concept differs slightly between married couples or civil partners, where residency is assessed individually rather than jointly. Additionally, the determination of ordinary residence influences entitlements related to health services, tax residency, and potential liabilities under Irish domicile law. Understanding these concepts is crucial for individuals planning to relocate to Ireland or seeking to navigate complex tax regulations.",

Lack of work: for example, your employer no longer needs or has a reduced need for employees with your skills or new technology has made your job unnecessary.

It can also be used to renovate vacant and derelict properties that have not been used as residential properties before. However, this only applies if the non-residential properties were used for commercial or public use before and now have the correct planning permission. You can get the grant if you are refurbishing the vacant property so you can live there, or so you can rent the property out. You can get a grant of up to \u20ac50,000 to renovate a vacant property and up to \u20ac70,000, if the property is derelict. You can get more if you are living on an off-shore island. And, there is an additional grant for expert conservation advice if you are refurbishing a vacant traditional farmhouse. The Vacant Property Refurbishment Grant is funded by the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage through the Cro\u00ed C\u00f3naithe (Towns) Fund and you apply to your local authority. If you have questions about the grant or want to know if your property qualifies, you can: Read the FAQs about the grant Contact the Vacant Homes Officer in your local authority Contact the Housing Agency's Vacancy Helpline on vacancycampaign@housingagency.ie You can also find information on how to re-use old and vacant buildings in the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage\u2019s Bringing Back Homes (pdf) manual.",

            "answer": "The Vacant Property Refurbishment Grant is a government program designed to help homeowners or landlords who want to renovate or refurbish empty properties. Under this grant, individuals can receive financial assistance to complete various types of work on vacant properties, including demolition, substructure repairs, superstructure modifications, external improvements like skirting and tiling, internal renovations such as door installation, and painting. Additionally, the grant covers professional services related to the project, but it's important to note that the grant doesn't typically cover the entire cost of reconstructing a property from scratch. Instead, it aims to provide partial funding to make the property livable or suitable for renting.",

This means that if you have a pre-nuptial agreement in place and you end up in court following the breakdown of your marriage, the judge is not bound by the terms of the pre-nuptial agreement. The only provision in Irish law is under sections 113 and 113A of the Succession Act 1965 (as amended) where a spouse or a civil partner can renounce his/her legal right share in a pre-nuptial agreement. Although they are not legally binding, there is nothing in Irish law which stops a couple planning to marry from having and signing a pre-nuptial agreement. Importantly, such agreements can serve as guides for the courts in judicial separation and divorce cases. If a pre-nuptial agreement makes \u2018proper provision\u2019 for each person it is more likely to be persuasive on the judge. Therefore, in situations where one party is likely to inherit a significant family farm or business, it will guide the judge in the divorce or judicial separation on what the parties\u2019 intentions were at the outset.",
