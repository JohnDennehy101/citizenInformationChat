It's often used in legal contexts such as property disputes or real estate transactions to determine which property belongs to whom. The concept of an ordinary residence can vary based on local laws and customs, but generally it indicates the primary living quarters for a person. To clarify, if you're asking about the meaning of this term in everyday language, it typically means where a person spends most of their time living. For example, if two people have different homes but live at each other's houses periodically, they might consider one another's places to be residences, depending on how frequently they visit each other.",

Lack of work: for example, your employer no longer needs or has a reduced need for employees with your skills or new technology has made your job unnecessary.

            "answer": "Genuine redundancy refers to a situation where an employee is laid off or terminated due to lack of work, rather than for poor performance or other non-merit reasons. This can include layoffs during economic downturns or restructuring efforts by employers. Genuine redundancies are typically justified by the company's need to reduce costs and improve efficiency, but they should be carried out in a fair and transparent manner to avoid legal issues. The process usually involves providing employees with notice, offering them alternative employment options if possible, and ensuring that any severance packages are fair and reasonable.

However, this only applies if the non-residential properties were used for commercial or public use before and now have the correct planning permission. You can get the grant if you are refurbishing the vacant property so you can live there, or so you can rent the property out. You can get a grant of up to \u20ac50,000 to renovate a vacant property and up to \u20ac70,000, if the property is derelict. You can get more if you are living on an off-shore island. And, there is an additional grant for expert conservation advice if you are refurbishing a vacant traditional farmhouse. The Vacant Property Refurbishment Grant is funded by the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage through the Cro\u00ed C\u00f3naithe (Towns) Fund and you apply to your local authority. If you have questions about the grant or want to know if your property qualifies, you can: Read the FAQs about the grant Contact the Vacant Homes Officer in your local authority Contact the Housing Agency's Vacancy Helpline on vacancycampaign@housingagency.ie You can also find information on how to re-use old and vacant buildings in the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage\u2019s Bringing Back Homes (pdf) manual.",
            "question": "What is the Vacant Property Refurbishment Grant?",
            "answer": "The Vacant Property Refurbishment Grant is a UK government scheme that provides financial support for businesses and community groups who want to refurbish vacant properties. The aim of this grant is to help people turn derelict buildings into productive assets, which can then be rented out or used for other commercial purposes.\nThis information was sourced from the official website of the Department for Communities and Local Government (DCLG), which administers the scheme. The DCLG's purpose is to improve housing conditions in England by providing grants and funding opportunities for projects aimed at transforming underutilized property into more viable urban spaces. By supporting such initiatives, they hope to stimulate local economies, create jobs, and enhance quality of life within communities.",

The only provision in Irish law is under sections 113 and 113A of the Succession Act 1965 (as amended) where a spouse or a civil partner can renounce his/her legal right share in a pre-nuptial agreement. Although they are not legally binding, there is nothing in Irish law which stops a couple planning to marry from having and signing a pre-nuptial agreement. Importantly, such agreements can serve as guides for the courts in judicial separation and divorce cases. If a pre-nuptial agreement makes \u2018proper provision\u2019 for each person it is more likely to be persuasive on the judge.

            "answer": "The Luas, a Dublin bus network, operates on a schedule that can vary depending on the day and time. The main routes run from 5:30 AM until midnight daily, with some services extending into the early evening. Frequency varies by route; for example, Route 41 runs every 12 minutes during peak times but may be as frequent as every 6 minutes during off-peak periods. It's important to check the current timetable or use an app like Transport for Ireland (TfI) for the most accurate information about service changes and delays.",
