            "answer": "The grant program was created by a law passed in 2013. It provides up-to-date resources and technical assistance for property owners who are looking at making improvements on their vacant properties.\nThis information pertains only partially, as it doesn't provide all of the details about this specific type of government funding that could be used toward renovating abandoned homes or other structures which have been left unused without any plans being made towards its improvement over time through lackluster maintenance practices (e.g., failing roof).",

This means that if you have a pre-nuptial agreement in place and you end up in court following the breakdown of your marriage, the judge is not bound by the terms of the pre-nuptial agreement. The only provision in Irish law is under sections 113 and 113A of the Succession Act 1965 (as amended) where a spouse or a civil partner can renounce his/her legal right share in a pre-nuptial agreement. Although they are not legally binding, there is nothing in Irish law which stops a couple planning to marry from having and signing a pre-nuptial agreement. Importantly, such agreements can serve as guides for the courts in judicial separation and divorce cases. If a pre-nuptial agreement makes \u2018proper provision\u2019 for each person it is more likely to be persuasive on the judge. Therefore, in situations where one party is likely to inherit a significant family farm or business, it will guide the judge in the divorce or judicial separation on what the parties\u2019 intentions were at the outset.",
