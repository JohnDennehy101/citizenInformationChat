You can get the grant if you are refurbishing the vacant property so you can live there, or so you can rent the property out. You can get a grant of up to \u20ac50,000 to renovate a vacant property and up to \u20ac70,000, if the property is derelict. You can get more if you are living on an off-shore island.

Your employer pays for a new bike and then you repay the cost of regular instalments from your gross (overall) salary. You do not have to pay tax, PRSI or the Universal Social Charge on your repayments. Not every employer takes part in the scheme. However, if they do, they must offer it to all their employees. If you are self-employed, you cannot take part in the Cycle to Work Scheme unless you pay PRSI as an employee in addition to your self-employed work.",

            "answer": "The Cycle to Work Scheme is a government program that allows employers to provide employees with new bikes and associated safety equipment at no cost to them. The employees then make periodic payments back into their salaries to cover the cost of these purchases. Under this scheme, employees do not have to pay taxes, PRSI, or the Universal Social Charge on the amounts they repaid. Employers must participate in the scheme and must offer it to all eligible employees who are working under the same employment contract.",
