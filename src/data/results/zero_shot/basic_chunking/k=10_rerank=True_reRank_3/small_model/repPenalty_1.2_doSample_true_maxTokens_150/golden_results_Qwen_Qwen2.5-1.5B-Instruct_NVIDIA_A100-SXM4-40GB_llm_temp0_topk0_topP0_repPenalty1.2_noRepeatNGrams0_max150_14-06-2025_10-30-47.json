A genuine redundancy is one where your employer has a real business reason to make you redundant. Reasons for redundancy include: Financial difficulties within the business: for example, your employer needs to cut costs and this means staff numbers must be reduced. Lack of work: for example, your employer no longer needs or has a reduced need for employees with your skills or new technology has made your job unnecessary. Reorganisation within the business: for example, your employer has decided to carry on the business with fewer or no staff or the job you do no longer exists.

            "answer": "Genuine redundancy is when an employee's job position or role no longer exists within a company. This typically happens due to changes in business strategy, market conditions, or technological advancements that make certain jobs obsolete.\nTo determine if someone qualifies for redundancy, you should consider whether their current employment status and skills are still relevant given these factors. If they have been with the organization long enough but feel unneeded because of changing circumstances, this could be grounds for being considered redundant. It\u2019s important to note that companies usually provide fair notice before making such decisions regarding employees' positions. \n\nIn conclusion, true redundancy involves losing one's job entirely because there aren't any more suitable roles available at the same level where the individual has expertise.",

The Vacant Property Refurbishment Grant is funded by the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage through the Cro\u00ed C\u00f3naithe (Towns) Fund and you apply to your local authority. If you have questions about the grant or want to know if your property qualifies, you can: Read the FAQs about the grant Contact the Vacant Homes Officer in your local authority Contact the Housing Agency's Vacancy Helpline on vacancycampaign@housingagency.ie You can also find information on how to re-use old and vacant buildings in the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage\u2019s Bringing Back Homes (pdf) manual.",
            "question": "What is the Vacant Property Refurbishment Grant?",
            "answer": "The Vacant Property Refurbishment Grant (VPRG) provides funding for projects that rehabilitate or demolish vacant properties. The grant covers up to 75% of eligible costs, with a maximum award amount of $10 million per project.\nTo be considered for this program, applicants must meet specific eligibility requirements and submit detailed plans outlining how they will use the funds effectively.

The only provision in Irish law is under sections 113 and 113A of the Succession Act 1965 (as amended) where a spouse or a civil partner can renounce his/her legal right share in a pre-nuptial agreement. Although they are not legally binding, there is nothing in Irish law which stops a couple planning to marry from having and signing a pre-nuptial agreement. Importantly, such agreements can serve as guides for the courts in judicial separation and divorce cases. If a pre-nuptial agreement makes \u2018proper provision\u2019 for each person it is more likely to be persuasive on the judge.

The service runs every half hour during peak times between 7am - 9pm Monday through Friday.\nTo determine if this information is accurate or not for you would require looking up official Luas schedules online as they can change over time due to various factors such as maintenance work etc., but based off what I know about it's regular schedule its pretty much correct!",
