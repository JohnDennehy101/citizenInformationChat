You can get the grant if you are refurbishing the vacant property so you can live there, or so you can rent the property out. You can get a grant of up to \u20ac50,000 to renovate a vacant property and up to \u20ac70,000, if the property is derelict. You can get more if you are living on an off-shore island.

This means that if you have a pre-nuptial agreement in place and you end up in court following the breakdown of your marriage, the judge is not bound by the terms of the pre-nuptial agreement. The only provision in Irish law is under sections 113 and 113A of the Succession Act 1965 (as amended) where a spouse or a civil partner can renounce his/her legal right share in a pre-nuptial agreement. Although they are not legally binding, there is nothing in Irish law which stops a couple planning to marry from having and signing a pre-nuptial agreement. Importantly, such agreements can serve as guides for the courts in judicial separation and divorce cases. If a pre-nuptial agreement makes \u2018proper provision\u2019 for each person it is more likely to be persuasive on the judge. Therefore, in situations where one party is likely to inherit a significant family farm or business, it will guide the judge in the divorce or judicial separation on what the parties\u2019 intentions were at the outset.",

            "answer": "Pre-nuptial agreements have no legal status in Ireland because they are not officially recognized by law.\nTo elaborate further, pre-nuptial agreements aim to outline the distribution of marital wealth during a potential divorce scenario. However, due to lack of official recognition in Irish legislation, judges generally disregard them when deciding upon inheritance issues post-divorce. Despite this, certain provisions outlined in pre-nupagements might still affect decision-making processes involving courts dealing with matrimonial disputes. For instance, while formalized prenups aren't legally binding themselves, the contents thereof could play roles akin to guidelines guiding the judiciary towards fairer outcomes through case-by-case interpretation.",
