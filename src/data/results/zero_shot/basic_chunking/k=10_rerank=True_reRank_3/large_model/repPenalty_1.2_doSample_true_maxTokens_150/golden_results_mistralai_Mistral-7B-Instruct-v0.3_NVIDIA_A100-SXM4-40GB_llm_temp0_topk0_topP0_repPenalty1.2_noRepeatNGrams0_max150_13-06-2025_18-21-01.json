            "question": "What is the Vacant Property Refurbishment Grant?",
            "answer": "The Vacant Property Refurbishment Grant (VPRG) is a financial assistance program designed in Ireland, specifically targeting private owners of vacant residential properties for refurbishing them into fit homesteads. Owners can qualify if their property has been vacant and unsold for two years or more. The grant covers work like roof repairs, re-wiring, plumbing, insulation, heating systems, renovating kitchens and bathrooms, as well as essential external works related to safety and energy conservation improvements. This scheme aims to help tackle housing shortages by providing funding incentives for bringing derelict properties back into productive use, ultimately contributing to urban regeneration efforts.",

This means that if you have a pre-nuptial agreement in place and you end up in court following the breakdown of your marriage, the judge is not bound by the terms of the pre-nuptial agreement. The only provision in Irish law is under sections 113 and 113A of the Succession Act 1965 (as amended) where a spouse or a civil partner can renounce his/her legal right share in a pre-nuptial agreement. Although they are not legally binding, there is nothing in Irish law which stops a couple planning to marry from having and signing a pre-nuptial agreement. Importantly, such agreements can serve as guides for the courts in judicial separation and divorce cases. If a pre-nuptial agreement makes \u2018proper provision\u2019 for each person it is more likely to be persuasive on the judge. Therefore, in situations where one party is likely to inherit a significant family farm or business, it will guide the judge in the divorce or judicial separation on what the parties\u2019 intentions were at the outset.",

These agreements often outline how property and assets will be divided in case of a divorce or death. Pre-nuptial agreements have become increasingly common over recent years due to their ability to provide financial protection for parties who bring significant assets into a marriage, including family businesses. However, it's important to note that while there is no federal law regarding these types of contracts, each state has its own set of rules governing their enforcement. Commonly discussed issues include fairness, full disclosure, and voluntary execution (i.e., both parties should enter into the agreement knowingly and without coercion).",

            "answer": "The Luas Red Line operates from The Point (Sandyford) in the south, through the city centre, and ends at Tallaght in the West. It generally runs from 5 AM until midnight except on weekends when it extends until 1 or 2 AM depending upon demand.\n\nThe Green line is slightly shorter and connects Brides Glen/Cherrywood in the South-East towards Pharrell Street with stops at the Docklands and St Stephen\u2019s Green before terminating at Broombridge near Cabra West. Its daily service commences around 4 or 5 AM, and finishes roughly between midnight and 1 AM, again this can vary based on need.",
