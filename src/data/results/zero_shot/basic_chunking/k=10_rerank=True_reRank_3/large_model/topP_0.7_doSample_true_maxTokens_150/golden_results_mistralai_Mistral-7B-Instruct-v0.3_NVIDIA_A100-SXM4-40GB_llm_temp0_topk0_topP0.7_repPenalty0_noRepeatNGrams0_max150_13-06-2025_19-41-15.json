In taxation, it may determine which country has the right to tax a person's income.

A genuine redundancy is one where your employer has a real business reason to make you redundant. Reasons for redundancy include: Financial difficulties within the business: for example, your employer needs to cut costs and this means staff numbers must be reduced. Lack of work: for example, your employer no longer needs or has a reduced need for employees with your skills or new technology has made your job unnecessary. Reorganisation within the business: for example, your employer has decided to carry on the business with fewer or no staff or the job you do no longer exists.

            "answer": "Genuine redundancy occurs when an employer has a valid reason for reducing the workforce, such as a downturn in business, restructuring, or technological changes that make a role no longer necessary. It's essential to follow a fair and reasonable process, which may include consulting with employees and offering support for those affected. It's important to note that not all job losses qualify as genuine redundancy. For example, if the employer is looking to replace an employee with someone cheaper or because they have personal issues with the employee, it would not be considered genuine redundancy.",

This means that if you have a pre-nuptial agreement in place and you end up in court following the breakdown of your marriage, the judge is not bound by the terms of the pre-nuptial agreement. The only provision in Irish law is under sections 113 and 113A of the Succession Act 1965 (as amended) where a spouse or a civil partner can renounce his/her legal right share in a pre-nuptial agreement. Although they are not legally binding, there is nothing in Irish law which stops a couple planning to marry from having and signing a pre-nuptial agreement. Importantly, such agreements can serve as guides for the courts in judicial separation and divorce cases. If a pre-nuptial agreement makes \u2018proper provision\u2019 for each person it is more likely to be persuasive on the judge. Therefore, in situations where one party is likely to inherit a significant family farm or business, it will guide the judge in the divorce or judicial separation on what the parties\u2019 intentions were at the outset.",

The validity and enforceability of prenups can vary by jurisdiction, but generally, they are upheld in court if they meet certain criteria. These criteria may include full disclosure of assets and financial information, fairness of the agreement, and that each party had independent legal representation during the agreement's creation.",
