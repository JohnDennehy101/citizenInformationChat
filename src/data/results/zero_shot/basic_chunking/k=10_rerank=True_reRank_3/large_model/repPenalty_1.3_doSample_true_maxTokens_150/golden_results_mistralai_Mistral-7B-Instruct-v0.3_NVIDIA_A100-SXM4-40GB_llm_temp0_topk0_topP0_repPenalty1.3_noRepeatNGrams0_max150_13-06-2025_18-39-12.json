You can usually also visit in person, but check if appointments are necessary due to COVID-19 restrictions.\n- Gather Necessary Documents: Prepare the required documents such as proof of identity (either a passport, national ID card, or driving license), income documentation like tax returns or payslips from employment, bank statements, bills, household expenses lists, details about any dependents you have, etc. The exact list might vary depending on where you live, so double-check with your local authority what exactly is needed when applying.",

This means that if you have a pre-nuptial agreement in place and you end up in court following the breakdown of your marriage, the judge is not bound by the terms of the pre-nuptial agreement. The only provision in Irish law is under sections 113 and 113A of the Succession Act 1965 (as amended) where a spouse or a civil partner can renounce his/her legal right share in a pre-nuptial agreement. Although they are not legally binding, there is nothing in Irish law which stops a couple planning to marry from having and signing a pre-nuptial agreement. Importantly, such agreements can serve as guides for the courts in judicial separation and divorce cases. If a pre-nuptial agreement makes \u2018proper provision\u2019 for each person it is more likely to be persuasive on the judge. Therefore, in situations where one party is likely to inherit a significant family farm or business, it will guide the judge in the divorce or judicial separation on what the parties\u2019 intentions were at the outset.",

There are electronic displays telling you the time of the next tram at every Luas stop. In addition, there are electronic displays and announcements informing passengers of the next stop on board every tram. Special services operate during Christmas, New Year and on other occasions.",
            "question": "What are the operating hours and frequency of the Luas?",
            "answer": "The Luas operates from approximately 05:30 in the morning until midnight on weekdays, with extended service during events at the aviva stadium or other special occasions. On Saturdays, it runs slightly later than usual but will not reach midnight. Sundays have reduced services compared to weekday operations due to lower demand for public transportation. Typically, trams run every 7 minutes between 6 AM and 10 PM on weekends on both Red Line (Abbotstown - The Point) and Green Line (Brides Glen/Sandyford \u2013 Broombridge). However, please check their website for real-time schedule updates as they can differ based upon seasonal changes and operational needs.",
