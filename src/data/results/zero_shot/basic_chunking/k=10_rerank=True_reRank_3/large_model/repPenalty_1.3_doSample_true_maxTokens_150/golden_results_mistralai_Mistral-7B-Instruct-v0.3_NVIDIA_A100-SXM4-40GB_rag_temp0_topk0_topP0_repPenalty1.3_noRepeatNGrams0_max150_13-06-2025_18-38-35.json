It can also be used to renovate vacant and derelict properties that have not been used as residential properties before. However, this only applies if the non-residential properties were used for commercial or public use before and now have the correct planning permission. You can get the grant if you are refurbishing the vacant property so you can live there, or so you can rent the property out. You can get a grant of up to \u20ac50,000 to renovate a vacant property and up to \u20ac70,000, if the property is derelict. You can get more if you are living on an off-shore island. And, there is an additional grant for expert conservation advice if you are refurbishing a vacant traditional farmhouse. The Vacant Property Refurbishment Grant is funded by the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage through the Cro\u00ed C\u00f3naithe (Towns) Fund and you apply to your local authority.

The only provision in Irish law is under sections 113 and 113A of the Succession Act 1965 (as amended) where a spouse or a civil partner can renounce his/her legal right share in a pre-nuptial agreement. Although they are not legally binding, there is nothing in Irish law which stops a couple planning to marry from having and signing a pre-nuptial agreement. Importantly, such agreements can serve as guides for the courts in judicial separation and divorce cases. If a pre-nuptial agreement makes \u2018proper provision\u2019 for each person it is more likely to be persuasive on the judge. Therefore, in situations where one party is likely to inherit a significant family farm or business, it will guide the judge in the divorce or judicial separation on what the parties\u2019 intentions were at the outset.",

            "answer": "In Ireland, the Department of Transport plays a crucial role in regulating air transport, covering both commercial and private services. However, there are specialized agencies under them such as the Irish Aviation Authority which handles aviation safety, security, and consumer protection responsibilities as well as air navigation services through another entity called Airnav Ireland. Additionally, the Department of Defense manages military air transportation matters in Ireland.",

            "answer": "The Cycle to Work Scheme, also referred to as the Bike to Work Scheme, enables employees to obtain a new bike without paying taxes while their employers provide financial coverage, which employees subsequently repay via installments taken from their pre-tax salaries. Not all employers participate; however, those who do must extend this opportunity equally amongst its staff members. Self- employed individuals are only eligible if they contribute to social insurance payments beyond their business operations. Benefits include reduced personal expenditure associated with commuting due to lowered tax, universal social charge, and payment relevant contribution rates.",
