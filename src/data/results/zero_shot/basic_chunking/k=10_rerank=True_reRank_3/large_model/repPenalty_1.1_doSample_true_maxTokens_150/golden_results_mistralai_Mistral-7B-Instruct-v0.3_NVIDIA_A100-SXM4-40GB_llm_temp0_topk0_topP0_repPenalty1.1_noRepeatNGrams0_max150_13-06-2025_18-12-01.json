Lack of work: for example, your employer no longer needs or has a reduced need for employees with your skills or new technology has made your job unnecessary.

It occurs when an employer can no longer reasonably continue the job because of changes to the operational requirements of the organisation, not due to the employee's capabilities or performance. This could be due to various reasons such as technological advancements, restructuring, or a decrease in business demand. To qualify for genuine redundancy, the employer must have followed a fair process, considered redeployment options within the company and offered reasonable support to find new work.\n\nIn short, genuine redundancy refers specifically to situations where a job position no longer exists due to organizational changes, not because of the individual employee's performance or capabilities.",

This means that if you have a pre-nuptial agreement in place and you end up in court following the breakdown of your marriage, the judge is not bound by the terms of the pre-nuptial agreement. The only provision in Irish law is under sections 113 and 113A of the Succession Act 1965 (as amended) where a spouse or a civil partner can renounce his/her legal right share in a pre-nuptial agreement. Although they are not legally binding, there is nothing in Irish law which stops a couple planning to marry from having and signing a pre-nuptial agreement. Importantly, such agreements can serve as guides for the courts in judicial separation and divorce cases. If a pre-nuptial agreement makes \u2018proper provision\u2019 for each person it is more likely to be persuasive on the judge. Therefore, in situations where one party is likely to inherit a significant family farm or business, it will guide the judge in the divorce or judicial separation on what the parties\u2019 intentions were at the outset.",
