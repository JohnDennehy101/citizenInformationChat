However, this only applies if the non-residential properties were used for commercial or public use before and now have the correct planning permission. You can get the grant if you are refurbishing the vacant property so you can live there, or so you can rent the property out. You can get a grant of up to \u20ac50,000 to renovate a vacant property and up to \u20ac70,000, if the property is derelict. You can get more if you are living on an off-shore island. And, there is an additional grant for expert conservation advice if you are refurbishing a vacant traditional farmhouse. The Vacant Property Refurbishment Grant is funded by the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage through the Cro\u00ed C\u00f3naithe (Towns) Fund and you apply to your local authority. If you have questions about the grant or want to know if your property qualifies, you can: Read the FAQs about the grant Contact the Vacant Homes Officer in your local authority Contact the Housing Agency's Vacancy Helpline on vacancycampaign@housingagency.ie You can also find information on how to re-use old and vacant buildings in the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage\u2019s Bringing Back Homes (pdf) manual.",

For example, in the United States, New York State has a point system where a driver can accumulate up to 11 points within 18 months, and in the United Kingdom, the system is known as the \"Endorsement System\" and drivers can accumulate up to 12 points within a three-year period.

This means that if you have a pre-nuptial agreement in place and you end up in court following the breakdown of your marriage, the judge is not bound by the terms of the pre-nuptial agreement. The only provision in Irish law is under sections 113 and 113A of the Succession Act 1965 (as amended) where a spouse or a civil partner can renounce his/her legal right share in a pre-nuptial agreement. Although they are not legally binding, there is nothing in Irish law which stops a couple planning to marry from having and signing a pre-nuptial agreement. Importantly, such agreements can serve as guides for the courts in judicial separation and divorce cases. If a pre-nuptial agreement makes \u2018proper provision\u2019 for each person it is more likely to be persuasive on the judge. Therefore, in situations where one party is likely to inherit a significant family farm or business, it will guide the judge in the divorce or judicial separation on what the parties\u2019 intentions were at the outset.",

            "question": "What is the Cycle to Work Scheme?",
            "answer": "The Cycle to Work Scheme is a government-approved initiative that allows employees to get a new bike and cycling equipment through their salary, saving up to 42% on the total cost. The scheme is run by employers who partner with a scheme provider, and it's a tax-efficient way for employees to get a bike for commuting or leisure. The employee pays for the bike through salary sacrifice, which means they agree to give up part of their salary in exchange for the bike. This reduces their taxable income, resulting in savings on National Insurance contributions and income tax. The employer then buys the bike and equipment on behalf of the employee, and the employee repays the cost through monthly deductions from their salary over a period of 12 to 18 months. At the end of the repayment period, the employee owns the bike and equipment outright.",
