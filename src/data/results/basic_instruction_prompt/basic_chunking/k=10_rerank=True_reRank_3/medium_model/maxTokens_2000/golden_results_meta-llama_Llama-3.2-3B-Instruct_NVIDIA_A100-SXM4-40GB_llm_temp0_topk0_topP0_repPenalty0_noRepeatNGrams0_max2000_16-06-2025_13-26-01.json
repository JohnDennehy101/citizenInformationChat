In the United States, pre-nuptial agreements are legally enforceable in all states, but the enforceability can depend on the jurisdiction. In some states, pre-nuptial agreements may be subject to certain conditions or requirements. Generally, pre-nuptial agreements must be in writing, signed by both spouses, and not be against public policy. The laws governing pre-nuptial agreements can be complex and may be subject to change. \n\nNote: The above answer is based on general information and may not be specific to all jurisdictions.
