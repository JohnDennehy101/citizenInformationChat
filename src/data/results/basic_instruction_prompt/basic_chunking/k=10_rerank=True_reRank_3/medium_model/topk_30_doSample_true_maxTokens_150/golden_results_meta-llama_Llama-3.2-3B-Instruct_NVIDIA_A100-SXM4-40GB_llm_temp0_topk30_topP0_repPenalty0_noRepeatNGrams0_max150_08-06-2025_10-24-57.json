A genuine redundancy is one where your employer has a real business reason to make you redundant. Reasons for redundancy include: Financial difficulties within the business: for example, your employer needs to cut costs and this means staff numbers must be reduced. Lack of work: for example, your employer no longer needs or has a reduced need for employees with your skills or new technology has made your job unnecessary. Reorganisation within the business: for example, your employer has decided to carry on the business with fewer or no staff or the job you do no longer exists. Business closure: the business is closing down or moving.",
            "question": "What counts as genuine redundancy?",
            "answer": "Genuine redundancy occurs when a language or expression is repeated for a purpose other than emphasis, to avoid ambiguity, or to convey a particular tone. For example, saying \"we're going to the store, we're going to the store\" is not redundant because it emphasizes the action. However, saying \"I'm going to the store, I'm going to the store, I'm going to the store\" is redundant because it repeats the information unnecessarily. Genuine redundancy is often used in language to create a sense of rhythm or musicality, as in the repetition of a phrase or word in a song or poem. In this context, the repetition is used to create a specific effect, such as emphasis or mood, rather than to convey new information.",

However, this only applies if the non-residential properties were used for commercial or public use before and now have the correct planning permission. You can get the grant if you are refurbishing the vacant property so you can live there, or so you can rent the property out. You can get a grant of up to \u20ac50,000 to renovate a vacant property and up to \u20ac70,000, if the property is derelict. You can get more if you are living on an off-shore island. And, there is an additional grant for expert conservation advice if you are refurbishing a vacant traditional farmhouse. The Vacant Property Refurbishment Grant is funded by the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage through the Cro\u00ed C\u00f3naithe (Towns) Fund and you apply to your local authority. If you have questions about the grant or want to know if your property qualifies, you can: Read the FAQs about the grant Contact the Vacant Homes Officer in your local authority Contact the Housing Agency's Vacancy Helpline on vacancycampaign@housingagency.ie You can also find information on how to re-use old and vacant buildings in the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage\u2019s Bringing Back Homes (pdf) manual.",
            "question": "What is the Vacant Property Refurbishment Grant?",
            "answer": "The Vacant Property Refurbishment Grant is a program that helps property owners renovate and redevelop vacant or underutilized properties in urban areas. The grant provides financial assistance to support the rehabilitation of these properties, which can then be sold, rented, or repurposed to benefit the local community. This initiative aims to revitalize neighborhoods, increase property values, and create new economic opportunities. The grant typically covers a portion of the costs associated with renovation, such as construction, materials, and labor. By supporting property owners, the program helps to stimulate local economic growth and improve the quality of life for residents.",

The only provision in Irish law is under sections 113 and 113A of the Succession Act 1965 (as amended) where a spouse or a civil partner can renounce his/her legal right share in a pre-nuptial agreement. Although they are not legally binding, there is nothing in Irish law which stops a couple planning to marry from having and signing a pre-nuptial agreement. Importantly, such agreements can serve as guides for the courts in judicial separation and divorce cases. If a pre-nuptial agreement makes \u2018proper provision\u2019 for each person it is more likely to be persuasive on the judge.
