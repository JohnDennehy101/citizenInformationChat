Lack of work: for example, your employer no longer needs or has a reduced need for employees with your skills or new technology has made your job unnecessary. Reorganisation within the business: for example, your employer has decided to carry on the business with fewer or no staff or the job you do no longer exists.

This type of redundancy is often referred to as \"constructive redundancy\". In contrast, redundancy due to poor performance or misconduct is typically not considered genuine redundancy. The employee's performance or behavior is seen as a factor in their dismissal, rather than circumstances beyond their control. To determine whether redundancy is genuine, courts often look at the circumstances surrounding the dismissal and whether the employee was given adequate notice and support.",

The only provision in Irish law is under sections 113 and 113A of the Succession Act 1965 (as amended) where a spouse or a civil partner can renounce his/her legal right share in a pre-nuptial agreement. Although they are not legally binding, there is nothing in Irish law which stops a couple planning to marry from having and signing a pre-nuptial agreement. Importantly, such agreements can serve as guides for the courts in judicial separation and divorce cases. If a pre-nuptial agreement makes \u2018proper provision\u2019 for each person it is more likely to be persuasive on the judge.

However, the enforceability of pre-nuptial agreements can vary depending on the jurisdiction and the specific terms of the agreement. Some jurisdictions may not recognize pre-nuptial agreements or may have specific requirements for their validity.
