This means that if you have a pre-nuptial agreement in place and you end up in court following the breakdown of your marriage, the judge is not bound by the terms of the pre-nuptial agreement. The only provision in Irish law is under sections 113 and 113A of the Succession Act 1965 (as amended) where a spouse or a civil partner can renounce his/her legal right share in a pre-nuptial agreement. Although they are not legally binding, there is nothing in Irish law which stops a couple planning to marry from having and signing a pre-nuptial agreement. Importantly, such agreements can serve as guides for the courts in judicial separation and divorce cases. If a pre-nuptial agreement makes \u2018proper provision\u2019 for each person it is more likely to be persuasive on the judge.

In the United States, pre-nuptial agreements are generally recognized and enforceable, but the enforceability can depend on the state. Some jurisdictions may also recognize \"anti-trust\" pre-nuptial agreements, which are designed to prevent the parties from entering into a joint business venture.

The scheme allows employees to borrow a bike from the employer and repay the cost of the bike through payroll deductions over a set period of time, typically 12 or 24 months. The employee does not pay any income tax or national insurance contributions on the bike, as the employer deducts the cost from the employee's salary. The employer can also provide a 50% contribution towards the cost of the bike, depending on the scheme. By using the Cycle to Work Scheme, employees can save money on their commuting costs and reduce their carbon footprint.",
