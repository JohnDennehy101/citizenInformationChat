It is the place where a person has a home or a place of abode, and where they are accustomed to living. Ordinary residence is often used in the context of taxation, immigration, and other legal proceedings to determine a person's place of connection to a particular jurisdiction. In general, ordinary residence is determined by the courts on a case-by-case basis, taking into account factors such as the person's physical presence, their family and social ties, and their economic activities. Ultimately, the concept of ordinary residence is not fixed or static, but rather it can change over time due to various circumstances.\n\nNote: The question is quite broad, and the answer may vary depending on the jurisdiction and the specific context in which it is used.",

A genuine redundancy is one where your employer has a real business reason to make you redundant. Reasons for redundancy include: Financial difficulties within the business: for example, your employer needs to cut costs and this means staff numbers must be reduced. Lack of work: for example, your employer no longer needs or has a reduced need for employees with your skills or new technology has made your job unnecessary.

            "question": "What counts as genuine redundancy?",
            "answer": "Genuine redundancy is typically characterized by a significant duplication of information, effort, or resources, resulting in wasted time, money, or other valuable resources. This can occur in various contexts, such as:\n* Duplication of tasks or processes within an organization\n* Excessive use of similar language or jargon in communication\n* Repetitive or unnecessary features in a product or service\n* Overlapping or redundant data in a database or system\n* Unnecessary or redundant personnel or positions within an organization\n\nRedundancy can be evaluated by assessing the impact of the duplication on the overall efficiency, productivity, and effectiveness of the organization or system. In some cases, redundancy may be unavoidable due to regulatory or legal requirements, but it should be minimized to the extent possible. Redundancy can also be a sign of a larger issue, such as a lack of clear communication or a failure to prioritize tasks effectively.",

It can also be used to renovate vacant and derelict properties that have not been used as residential properties before. However, this only applies if the non-residential properties were used for commercial or public use before and now have the correct planning permission. You can get the grant if you are refurbishing the vacant property so you can live there, or so you can rent the property out. You can get a grant of up to \u20ac50,000 to renovate a vacant property and up to \u20ac70,000, if the property is derelict. You can get more if you are living on an off-shore island. And, there is an additional grant for expert conservation advice if you are refurbishing a vacant traditional farmhouse. The Vacant Property Refurbishment Grant is funded by the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage through the Cro\u00ed C\u00f3naithe (Towns) Fund and you apply to your local authority.

This means that if you have a pre-nuptial agreement in place and you end up in court following the breakdown of your marriage, the judge is not bound by the terms of the pre-nuptial agreement. The only provision in Irish law is under sections 113 and 113A of the Succession Act 1965 (as amended) where a spouse or a civil partner can renounce his/her legal right share in a pre-nuptial agreement. Although they are not legally binding, there is nothing in Irish law which stops a couple planning to marry from having and signing a pre-nuptial agreement. Importantly, such agreements can serve as guides for the courts in judicial separation and divorce cases. If a pre-nuptial agreement makes \u2018proper provision\u2019 for each person it is more likely to be persuasive on the judge. Therefore, in situations where one party is likely to inherit a significant family farm or business, it will guide the judge in the divorce or judicial separation on what the parties\u2019 intentions were at the outset.",

The legal status of pre-nuptial agreements varies by jurisdiction, with some countries and states recognizing their validity and others not. In general, pre-nuptial agreements are considered valid if they are: \n\n* Signed by both parties voluntarily and without duress or coercion.\n* Fair and reasonable, taking into account the financial situation of both parties.\n* In writing and witnessed by a third party.\n* Compliant with local laws and regulations.\n\nIn some jurisdictions, pre-nuptial agreements may be subject to certain requirements, such as disclosure of assets and liabilities, or the provision of financial information. However, even if a pre-nuptial agreement is not recognized by law, it may still be enforceable in a court of law if it meets the above criteria.",

            "ground_truth": "Under the Cycle to Work Scheme (also known as the Bike to Work Scheme), you can get a new bike tax free through your work. Your employer pays for a new bike and then you repay the cost of regular instalments from your gross (overall) salary. You do not have to pay tax, PRSI or the Universal Social Charge on your repayments. Not every employer takes part in the scheme. However, if they do, they must offer it to all their employees. If you are self-employed, you cannot take part in the Cycle to Work Scheme unless you pay PRSI as an employee in addition to your self-employed work.",
            "question": "What is the Cycle to Work Scheme?",
            "answer": "The Cycle to Work Scheme is a tax-free benefit provided by employers to encourage employees to cycle to work. It allows employees to cycle to work and back home without paying income tax on the benefit. The scheme is usually available to employees who cycle to work at least three times a week. The amount of the benefit depends on the distance cycled and the employee's income tax band. The scheme aims to reduce traffic congestion and promote environmentally friendly commuting.",
