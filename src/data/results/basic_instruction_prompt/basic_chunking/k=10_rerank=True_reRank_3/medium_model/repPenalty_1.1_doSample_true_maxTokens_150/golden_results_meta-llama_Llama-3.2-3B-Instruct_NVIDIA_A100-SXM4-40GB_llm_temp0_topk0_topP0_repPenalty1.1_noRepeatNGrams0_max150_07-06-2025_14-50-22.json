It is typically determined by the court when considering issues such as property ownership, taxation, and inheritance rights. The concept of ordinary residence varies across jurisdictions, but generally, it is based on the principle that a person's home is usually located in the place where they have chosen to live permanently. In practice, determining ordinary residence can be complex due to factors like dual residences, temporary stays, and changes in personal circumstances. A person's ordinary residence is often assessed based on their intention to remain in the location, rather than just physical presence.",

The only provision in Irish law is under sections 113 and 113A of the Succession Act 1965 (as amended) where a spouse or a civil partner can renounce his/her legal right share in a pre-nuptial agreement. Although they are not legally binding, there is nothing in Irish law which stops a couple planning to marry from having and signing a pre-nuptial agreement. Importantly, such agreements can serve as guides for the courts in judicial separation and divorce cases. If a pre-nuptial agreement makes \u2018proper provision\u2019 for each person it is more likely to be persuasive on the judge.

            "answer": "The Luas is Dublin's tram system that operates from 6am to midnight, Monday to Saturday, and 8am to midnight on Sundays. On weekdays, Luas trams run every 5-10 minutes during peak hours and less frequently outside of peak hours. The frequency of Luas services varies depending on the line, with some lines running as frequently as every 2-3 minutes during peak hours. At night, Luas services operate on a reduced timetable, with fewer trams and less frequent intervals between them. It's best to check the Transport Infrastructure Ireland (TII) website for the most up-to-date information on Luas schedules and frequencies.",
