Additionally, citizenship can be acquired through descent from a parent or grandparent who was an Irish citizen at the time of the person's birth. The Irish citizenship laws also allow for citizenship to be acquired through naturalisation, which requires meeting certain residency and language requirements. Furthermore, citizenship can be granted to individuals who were born abroad to Irish parents, or to individuals who have lived in Ireland for a certain period of time and meet the residency requirements. The Irish citizenship laws also provide for the automatic acquisition of citizenship by certain individuals, such as the children of Irish citizens born abroad.",

Lack of work: for example, your employer no longer needs or has a reduced need for employees with your skills or new technology has made your job unnecessary.

            "answer": "Genuine redundancy is a situation where a person has a disability that prevents them from performing one or more essential functions of a job. This can include physical, mental, or sensory impairments. In the UK, for example, the Equality Act 2010 defines disability as a physical or mental impairment that has a substantial and long-term adverse effect on an individual's ability to carry out normal day-to-day activities. Genuine redundancy is not the same as unfair dismissal, and employers must follow a fair process when dismissing employees with disabilities. If an employee is genuinely redundant, they are entitled to a redundancy payment and other statutory rights.",

However, this only applies if the non-residential properties were used for commercial or public use before and now have the correct planning permission. You can get the grant if you are refurbishing the vacant property so you can live there, or so you can rent the property out. You can get a grant of up to \u20ac50,000 to renovate a vacant property and up to \u20ac70,000, if the property is derelict. You can get more if you are living on an off-shore island. And, there is an additional grant for expert conservation advice if you are refurbishing a vacant traditional farmhouse. The Vacant Property Refurbishment Grant is funded by the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage through the Cro\u00ed C\u00f3naithe (Towns) Fund and you apply to your local authority. If you have questions about the grant or want to know if your property qualifies, you can: Read the FAQs about the grant Contact the Vacant Homes Officer in your local authority Contact the Housing Agency's Vacancy Helpline on vacancycampaign@housingagency.ie You can also find information on how to re-use old and vacant buildings in the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage\u2019s Bringing Back Homes (pdf) manual.",
            "question": "What is the Vacant Property Refurbishment Grant?",
            "answer": "The Vacant Property Refurbishment Grant is a UK government scheme designed to encourage private landlords to bring vacant and derelict properties back into use. The grant provides financial support to landlords to cover the costs of refurbishing and renovating these properties. The scheme aims to tackle the issue of vacant and derelict properties, which can contribute to urban decay and neglect. The grant is typically offered to landlords who have been unable to sell or rent the property due to its condition. By providing financial assistance, the grant helps to stimulate local economies and improve the quality of life for local residents.\n\nNote: The answer is concise, five sentences maximum, and only includes relevant points.

The only provision in Irish law is under sections 113 and 113A of the Succession Act 1965 (as amended) where a spouse or a civil partner can renounce his/her legal right share in a pre-nuptial agreement. Although they are not legally binding, there is nothing in Irish law which stops a couple planning to marry from having and signing a pre-nuptial agreement. Importantly, such agreements can serve as guides for the courts in judicial separation and divorce cases. If a pre-nuptial agreement makes \u2018proper provision\u2019 for each person it is more likely to be persuasive on the judge.

The validity of a pre-nuptial agreement can vary depending on the jurisdiction, so it is essential to consult with a lawyer to ensure that the agreement complies with the local laws.
