A genuine redundancy is one where your employer has a real business reason to make you redundant. Reasons for redundancy include: Financial difficulties within the business: for example, your employer needs to cut costs and this means staff numbers must be reduced. Lack of work: for example, your employer no longer needs or has a reduced need for employees with your skills or new technology has made your job unnecessary. Reorganisation within the business: for example, your employer has decided to carry on the business with fewer or no staff or the job you do no longer exists.

The employer must demonstrate a viable business justification for terminating the worker's employment. Examples of such situations include restructuring efforts, downsizing, mergers, acquisitions, technological advancements rendering certain jobs irrelevant, or significant declines in demand leading to layoffs. In each case, the decision-making process prioritizes minimizing losses over individual interests. To establish whether someone faces actual redundancy versus unjustified termination, courts consider factors like past performance reviews, severance packages offered, career prospects post-redundancy, etc.",

However, this only applies if the non-residential properties were used for commercial or public use before and now have the correct planning permission. You can get the grant if you are refurbishing the vacant property so you can live there, or so you can rent the property out. You can get a grant of up to \u20ac50,000 to renovate a vacant property and up to \u20ac70,000, if the property is derelict. You can get more if you are living on an off-shore island. And, there is an additional grant for expert conservation advice if you are refurbishing a vacant traditional farmhouse. The Vacant Property Refurbishment Grant is funded by the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage through the Cro\u00ed C\u00f3naithe (Towns) Fund and you apply to your local authority.

This means that if you have a pre-nuptial agreement in place and you end up in court following the breakdown of your marriage, the judge is not bound by the terms of the pre-nuptial agreement. The only provision in Irish law is under sections 113 and 113A of the Succession Act 1965 (as amended) where a spouse or a civil partner can renounce his/her legal right share in a pre-nuptial agreement. Although they are not legally binding, there is nothing in Irish law which stops a couple planning to marry from having and signing a pre-nuptial agreement. Importantly, such agreements can serve as guides for the courts in judicial separation and divorce cases. If a pre-nuptial agreement makes \u2018proper provision\u2019 for each person it is more likely to be persuasive on the judge. Therefore, in situations where one party is likely to inherit a significant family farm or business, it will guide the judge in the divorce or judicial separation on what the parties\u2019 intentions were at the outset.",
