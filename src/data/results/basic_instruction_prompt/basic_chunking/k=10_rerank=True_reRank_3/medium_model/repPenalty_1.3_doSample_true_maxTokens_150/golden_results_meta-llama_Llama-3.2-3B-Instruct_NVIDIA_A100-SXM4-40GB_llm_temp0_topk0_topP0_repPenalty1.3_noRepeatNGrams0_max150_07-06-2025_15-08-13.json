A genuine redundancy is one where your employer has a real business reason to make you redundant. Reasons for redundancy include: Financial difficulties within the business: for example, your employer needs to cut costs and this means staff numbers must be reduced. Lack of work: for example, your employer no longer needs or has a reduced need for employees with your skills or new technology has made your job unnecessary. Reorganisation within the business: for example, your employer has decided to carry on the business with fewer or no staff or the job you do no longer exists. Business closure: the business is closing down or moving.",
            "question": "What counts as genuine redundancy?",
            "answer": "Genuine redundancy occurs when there is no alternative and it provides value by reducing costs (e.g., outsourcing non-core functions) without compromising quality standards. Redundancy should be essential for business continuity rather than just being unnecessary duplication of effort. For example, having multiple suppliers that provide similar products ensures availability even if one supplier fails due to unforeseen circumstances like natural disasters. This type of redundancy also helps mitigate risks associated with supply chain disruptions. Ultimately, effective management is necessary to ensure this redundant capacity does not waste resources unnecessarily.\n\n\n\nNote from AI Modeler: The provided text seems well-structured and easy-to-understand.

However, this only applies if the non-residential properties were used for commercial or public use before and now have the correct planning permission. You can get the grant if you are refurbishing the vacant property so you can live there, or so you can rent the property out. You can get a grant of up to \u20ac50,000 to renovate a vacant property and up to \u20ac70,000, if the property is derelict. You can get more if you are living on an off-shore island. And, there is an additional grant for expert conservation advice if you are refurbishing a vacant traditional farmhouse. The Vacant Property Refurbishment Grant is funded by the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage through the Cro\u00ed C\u00f3naithe (Towns) Fund and you apply to your local authority. If you have questions about the grant or want to know if your property qualifies, you can: Read the FAQs about the grant Contact the Vacant Homes Officer in your local authority Contact the Housing Agency's Vacancy Helpline on vacancycampaign@housingagency.ie You can also find information on how to re-use old and vacant buildings in the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage\u2019s Bringing Back Homes (pdf) manual.",

            "answer": "The Vacant Properties (Assisted Acquisition) Act 2007 introduced the concept of vacant property grants for England and Wales. The grant provides financial assistance towards refurbishing properties that have been empty for more than six months due to owner/occupier disrepair issues such as dampness/mold problems, structural damage etc., allowing homeowners or landlords to undertake necessary repairs at reduced cost.",

They will guide applicants through the process which typically involves providing personal identification documents like birth certificates and proof of income. In some states, online applications are available on government websites; however, it's best to confirm this option before proceeding. Applicants must also meet specific eligibility criteria set forth by each state program. Once all necessary documentation is collected, submit the application package according to DSS instructions.\n\n\n\nAdditional Information:\n\n*   Contacting a representative at 211.org\n*   Visiting the website www.dss.ny.",

The only provision in Irish law is under sections 113 and 113A of the Succession Act 1965 (as amended) where a spouse or a civil partner can renounce his/her legal right share in a pre-nuptial agreement. Although they are not legally binding, there is nothing in Irish law which stops a couple planning to marry from having and signing a pre-nuptial agreement. Importantly, such agreements can serve as guides for the courts in judicial separation and divorce cases. If a pre-nuptial agreement makes \u2018proper provision\u2019 for each person it is more likely to be persuasive on the judge.
