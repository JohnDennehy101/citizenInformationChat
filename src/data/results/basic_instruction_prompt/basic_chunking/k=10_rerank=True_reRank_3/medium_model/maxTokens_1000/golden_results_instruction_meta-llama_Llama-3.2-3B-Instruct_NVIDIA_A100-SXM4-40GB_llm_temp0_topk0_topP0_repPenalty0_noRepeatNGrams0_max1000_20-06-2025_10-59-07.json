When evaluating redundancy, consider whether the repetition of information adds clarity or serves a rhetorical purpose.\n\nKey points:\n\n* Genuine redundancy serves to emphasize or illustrate a point.\n* It can be found in language, writing, and conversation.\n* Repeated words or phrases can be indicative of genuine redundancy.\n* Overly elaborate sentences or phrases can be redundant in writing.\n* Redundancy can add clarity or serve a rhetorical purpose.",

In some jurisdictions, a tenant may also be able to terminate the tenancy early if they are experiencing difficulties in paying the rent, but this is subject to the terms of the agreement and local laws. Additionally, if the landlord has been unable to carry out essential repairs or maintenance, the tenant may be able to terminate the tenancy.

In traffic law, penalty points are used to penalize drivers for certain offenses, such as speeding or reckless driving. The number of points assigned to a specific offense varies depending on the jurisdiction. Typically, drivers receive a certain number of points for each offense, and these points are added to their driving record. If a driver accumulates too many points, they may face penalties such as license suspension or revocation. In some jurisdictions, points can be deducted if a driver completes a defensive driving course or other rehabilitation programs. The system aims to deter drivers from engaging in reckless behavior and to promote safe driving practices. Points are usually tracked and recorded by the relevant authorities, and drivers can check their points balance to ensure they are aware of their status. Drivers may also have the option to dispute points if they believe they were unfairly assessed. The specific rules and regulations surrounding penalty points vary depending on the jurisdiction, so it's essential to familiarize yourself with the local laws and regulations.",

The only provision in Irish law is under sections 113 and 113A of the Succession Act 1965 (as amended) where a spouse or a civil partner can renounce his/her legal right share in a pre-nuptial agreement. Although they are not legally binding, there is nothing in Irish law which stops a couple planning to marry from having and signing a pre-nuptial agreement. Importantly, such agreements can serve as guides for the courts in judicial separation and divorce cases. If a pre-nuptial agreement makes \u2018proper provision\u2019 for each person it is more likely to be persuasive on the judge.
