This can include actions such as subletting, making unauthorized changes to the property, or failing to pay rent on time. In some jurisdictions, a tenant may also be able to terminate the lease if they have been evicted from a previous rental property. Additionally, if the tenant has been deemed unfit to occupy the property due to a health or safety concern, the landlord may have grounds to terminate the tenancy. The specific requirements for terminating a tenancy can vary depending on local laws and regulations.",

The points can also be used to track progress and monitor compliance with the rules. In some cases, the points can be transferred to another individual or organization, depending on the governing body's rules. The points are usually valid for a specific period, after which they are removed from the individual's or organization's record. \n\nNote: The information provided is a general overview of how penalty points work.

            "ground_truth": "Pre-nuptial agreements have no basis in law in Ireland. As a result, they are not strictly binding. This means that if you have a pre-nuptial agreement in place and you end up in court following the breakdown of your marriage, the judge is not bound by the terms of the pre-nuptial agreement. The only provision in Irish law is under sections 113 and 113A of the Succession Act 1965 (as amended) where a spouse or a civil partner can renounce his/her legal right share in a pre-nuptial agreement. Although they are not legally binding, there is nothing in Irish law which stops a couple planning to marry from having and signing a pre-nuptial agreement. Importantly, such agreements can serve as guides for the courts in judicial separation and divorce cases. If a pre-nuptial agreement makes \u2018proper provision\u2019 for each person it is more likely to be persuasive on the judge. Therefore, in situations where one party is likely to inherit a significant family farm or business, it will guide the judge in the divorce or judicial separation on what the parties\u2019 intentions were at the outset.",

In many jurisdictions, pre-nuptial agreements are legally recognized and enforceable. However, the specifics of pre-nuptial agreements can vary depending on the jurisdiction, and some jurisdictions may have restrictions on their use. Generally, pre-nuptial agreements must be entered into voluntarily and with full disclosure of assets and liabilities. If the agreement is found to be invalid or unenforceable, the court may disregard it or order it to be renegotiated. \n\nNote: The question does not specify the jurisdiction, but the general principles mentioned above apply to most countries.",
