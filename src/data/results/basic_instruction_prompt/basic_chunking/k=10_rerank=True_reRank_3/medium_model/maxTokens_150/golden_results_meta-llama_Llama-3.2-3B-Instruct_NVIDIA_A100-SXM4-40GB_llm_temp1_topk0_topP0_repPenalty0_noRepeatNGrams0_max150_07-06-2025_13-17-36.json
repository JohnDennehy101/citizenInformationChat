The Vacant Property Refurbishment Grant is funded by the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage through the Cro\u00ed C\u00f3naithe (Towns) Fund and you apply to your local authority. If you have questions about the grant or want to know if your property qualifies, you can: Read the FAQs about the grant Contact the Vacant Homes Officer in your local authority Contact the Housing Agency's Vacancy Helpline on vacancycampaign@housingagency.ie You can also find information on how to re-use old and vacant buildings in the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage\u2019s Bringing Back Homes (pdf) manual.",
            "question": "What is the Vacant Property Refurbishment Grant?",
            "answer": "The Vacant Property Refurbishment Grant is a funding program that aims to encourage the refurbishment and redevelopment of vacant and derelict properties in urban areas. The grant is typically provided by local authorities or government agencies to property owners who are willing to invest in the renovation and rehabilitation of these properties. The grant can cover a portion of the costs associated with the refurbishment, such as demolition, structural repairs, and energy-efficient upgrades. This program helps to revitalize neighborhoods, increase property values, and provide affordable housing options. By providing financial incentives, the Vacant Property Refurbishment Grant encourages property owners to take on the challenge of transforming vacant and derelict properties into functional and desirable spaces.",

The only provision in Irish law is under sections 113 and 113A of the Succession Act 1965 (as amended) where a spouse or a civil partner can renounce his/her legal right share in a pre-nuptial agreement. Although they are not legally binding, there is nothing in Irish law which stops a couple planning to marry from having and signing a pre-nuptial agreement. Importantly, such agreements can serve as guides for the courts in judicial separation and divorce cases. If a pre-nuptial agreement makes \u2018proper provision\u2019 for each person it is more likely to be persuasive on the judge.
