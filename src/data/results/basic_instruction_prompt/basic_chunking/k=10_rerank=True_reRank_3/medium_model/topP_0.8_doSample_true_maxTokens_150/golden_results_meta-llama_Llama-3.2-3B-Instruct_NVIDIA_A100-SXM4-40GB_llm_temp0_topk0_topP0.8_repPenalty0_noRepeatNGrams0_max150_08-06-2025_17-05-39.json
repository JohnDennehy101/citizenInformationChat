It is the place where a person has the right to reside, and where they are able to exercise their rights as a homeowner or tenant. The concept of ordinary residence is important in various contexts, including taxation, immigration, and social welfare. In general, ordinary residence is determined by the individual's intention to live in a particular place, rather than by their actual physical presence. The determination of ordinary residence can be complex and may involve consideration of various factors, including the person's family ties, employment, and other personal circumstances.",

Lack of work: for example, your employer no longer needs or has a reduced need for employees with your skills or new technology has made your job unnecessary.

However, this only applies if the non-residential properties were used for commercial or public use before and now have the correct planning permission. You can get the grant if you are refurbishing the vacant property so you can live there, or so you can rent the property out. You can get a grant of up to \u20ac50,000 to renovate a vacant property and up to \u20ac70,000, if the property is derelict. You can get more if you are living on an off-shore island. And, there is an additional grant for expert conservation advice if you are refurbishing a vacant traditional farmhouse. The Vacant Property Refurbishment Grant is funded by the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage through the Cro\u00ed C\u00f3naithe (Towns) Fund and you apply to your local authority. If you have questions about the grant or want to know if your property qualifies, you can: Read the FAQs about the grant Contact the Vacant Homes Officer in your local authority Contact the Housing Agency's Vacancy Helpline on vacancycampaign@housingagency.ie You can also find information on how to re-use old and vacant buildings in the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage\u2019s Bringing Back Homes (pdf) manual.",
            "question": "What is the Vacant Property Refurbishment Grant?",
            "answer": "The Vacant Property Refurbishment Grant is a government-funded scheme that provides financial assistance to property owners to help them refurbish and bring vacant properties back into use. The grant is designed to help local authorities and private landlords tackle the issue of vacant properties, which can have negative impacts on local communities and economies. The grant can cover up to 50% of the costs associated with refurbishing a property, including repairs, renovations, and improvements. The scheme aims to encourage property owners to invest in their properties and bring them back into use, thereby reducing the number of vacant properties and improving local living conditions. The grant is typically available for properties that have been vacant for a certain period of time, such as six months or more.",

This means that if you have a pre-nuptial agreement in place and you end up in court following the breakdown of your marriage, the judge is not bound by the terms of the pre-nuptial agreement. The only provision in Irish law is under sections 113 and 113A of the Succession Act 1965 (as amended) where a spouse or a civil partner can renounce his/her legal right share in a pre-nuptial agreement. Although they are not legally binding, there is nothing in Irish law which stops a couple planning to marry from having and signing a pre-nuptial agreement. Importantly, such agreements can serve as guides for the courts in judicial separation and divorce cases. If a pre-nuptial agreement makes \u2018proper provision\u2019 for each person it is more likely to be persuasive on the judge. Therefore, in situations where one party is likely to inherit a significant family farm or business, it will guide the judge in the divorce or judicial separation on what the parties\u2019 intentions were at the outset.",
