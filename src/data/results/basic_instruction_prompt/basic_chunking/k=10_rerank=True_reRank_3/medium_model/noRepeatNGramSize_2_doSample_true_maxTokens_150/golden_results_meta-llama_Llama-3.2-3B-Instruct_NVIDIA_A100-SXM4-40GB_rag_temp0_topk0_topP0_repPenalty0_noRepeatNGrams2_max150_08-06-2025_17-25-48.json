You can get a grant of up to \u20ac50,000 to renovate a vacant property and up to \u20ac70,000, if the property is derelict. You can get more if you are living on an off-shore island. And, there is an additional grant for expert conservation advice if you are refurbishing a vacant traditional farmhouse.

The company may offer you voluntary redundancy or severance pay as part and or part payment for your time of serving the Company.\n\nIn some cases, redundancy is paid to employees who have already left the job but are not yet eligible to receive a state pension. For example, if an employer closes a business and the employees are offered voluntary redundancies, but the employer has already made a payment to the employee, those payments may not necessarily be treated as statutory payments.",

This means that if you have a pre-nuptial agreement in place and you end up in court following the breakdown of your marriage, the judge is not bound by the terms of the pre-nuptial agreement. The only provision in Irish law is under sections 113 and 113A of the Succession Act 1965 (as amended) where a spouse or a civil partner can renounce his/her legal right share in a pre-nuptial agreement. Although they are not legally binding, there is nothing in Irish law which stops a couple planning to marry from having and signing a pre-nuptial agreement. Importantly, such agreements can serve as guides for the courts in judicial separation and divorce cases. If a pre-nuptial agreement makes \u2018proper provision\u2019 for each person it is more likely to be persuasive on the judge. Therefore, in situations where one party is likely to inherit a significant family farm or business, it will guide the judge in the divorce or judicial separation on what the parties\u2019 intentions were at the outset.",

However, Irish courts can take these agreements into consideration in divorce and separation cases where they make 'proper provisions' for parties.

You do not have to pay tax, PRSI or the Universal Social Charge on your repayments. Not every employer takes part in the scheme. However, if they do, they must offer it to all their employees.
