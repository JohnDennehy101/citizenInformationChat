            "answer": "The Vacant Property Refurbishment Grant is a financial assistance program for property renovation projects aimed at revitalizing vacant and derelict properties within a specified area. This grant typically covers part of the expenses for redevelopment works, such as repairing roofs and walls, replacing windows, installing new heating systems, and other required improvements, to bring the property back into habitable condition. The intended purpose is to encourage private property owners to refurbish their empty properties and make them available on the rental market, thus increasing housing stock and addressing local housing shortages. Eligibility criteria may vary depending on location and circumstances; applicants should consult their local authorities for specific details.",

This means that if you have a pre-nuptial agreement in place and you end up in court following the breakdown of your marriage, the judge is not bound by the terms of the pre-nuptial agreement. The only provision in Irish law is under sections 113 and 113A of the Succession Act 1965 (as amended) where a spouse or a civil partner can renounce his/her legal right share in a pre-nuptial agreement. Although they are not legally binding, there is nothing in Irish law which stops a couple planning to marry from having and signing a pre-nuptial agreement. Importantly, such agreements can serve as guides for the courts in judicial separation and divorce cases. If a pre-nuptial agreement makes \u2018proper provision\u2019 for each person it is more likely to be persuasive on the judge. Therefore, in situations where one party is likely to inherit a significant family farm or business, it will guide the judge in the divorce or judicial separation on what the parties\u2019 intentions were at the outset.",
