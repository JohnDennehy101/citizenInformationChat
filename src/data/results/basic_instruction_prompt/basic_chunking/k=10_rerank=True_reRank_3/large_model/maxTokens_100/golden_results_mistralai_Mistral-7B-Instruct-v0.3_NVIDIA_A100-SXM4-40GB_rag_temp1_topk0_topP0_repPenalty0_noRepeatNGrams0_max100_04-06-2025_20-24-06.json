It can also be used to renovate vacant and derelict properties that have not been used as residential properties before. However, this only applies if the non-residential properties were used for commercial or public use before and now have the correct planning permission. You can get the grant if you are refurbishing the vacant property so you can live there, or so you can rent the property out. You can get a grant of up to \u20ac50,000 to renovate a vacant property and up to \u20ac70,000, if the property is derelict. You can get more if you are living on an off-shore island. And, there is an additional grant for expert conservation advice if you are refurbishing a vacant traditional farmhouse. The Vacant Property Refurbishment Grant is funded by the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage through the Cro\u00ed C\u00f3naithe (Towns) Fund and you apply to your local authority.

Your employer pays for a new bike and then you repay the cost of regular instalments from your gross (overall) salary. You do not have to pay tax, PRSI or the Universal Social Charge on your repayments. Not every employer takes part in the scheme. However, if they do, they must offer it to all their employees. If you are self-employed, you cannot take part in the Cycle to Work Scheme unless you pay PRSI as an employee in addition to your self-employed work.",
            "question": "What is the Cycle to Work Scheme?",
            "answer": "The Cycle to Work Scheme is a tax-free way for employees to buy a new bike and bike safety equipment through their work. Employers pay for the bike and equipment, and employees repay the cost through regular instalments from their gross salary. The scheme allows employees to save on the costs of cycling to work because their repayments come out of their salary before tax, USC, and PRSI are deducted.",
