You can get the grant if you are refurbishing the vacant property so you can live there, or so you can rent the property out. You can get a grant of up to \u20ac50,000 to renovate a vacant property and up to \u20ac70,000, if the property is derelict. You can get more if you are living on an off-shore island. And, there is an additional grant for expert conservation advice if you are refurbishing a vacant traditional farmhouse. The Vacant Property Refurbishment Grant is funded by the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage through the Cro\u00ed C\u00f3naithe (Towns) Fund and you apply to your local authority.
