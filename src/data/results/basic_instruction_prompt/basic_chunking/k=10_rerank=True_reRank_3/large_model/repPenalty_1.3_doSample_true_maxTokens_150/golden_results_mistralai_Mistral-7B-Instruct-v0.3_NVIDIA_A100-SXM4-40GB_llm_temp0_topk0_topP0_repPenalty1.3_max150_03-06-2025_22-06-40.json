A genuine redundancy is one where your employer has a real business reason to make you redundant. Reasons for redundancy include: Financial difficulties within the business: for example, your employer needs to cut costs and this means staff numbers must be reduced. Lack of work: for example, your employer no longer needs or has a reduced need for employees with your skills or new technology has made your job unnecessary. Reorganisation within the business: for example, your employer has decided to carry on the business with fewer or no staff or the job you do no longer exists. Business closure: the business is closing down or moving.",
            "question": "What counts as genuine redundancy?",
            "answer": "Genuine redundancy occurs when an employer no longer requires an employee due to operational changes and cannot reasonably accommodate them into another role within their business; this is usually achieved by demonstrating that there have been ongoing discussions about changing positions/roles, job descriptions being discontinued, and adequate attempts at restructuring before making employment terminations. Redundancy payouts are determined using specific criteria outlined by government legislation, which may vary based on factors such as length of service and age (especially for those over 45). In all cases, it's essential for employers to document every step taken throughout the process while maintaining open communication channels to demonstrate fairness during workforce adjustments.",

Each offense has associated penalties which accrue on acquiring corresponding numbered points; however, each jurisdiction varies in point valuation for different violations (e.g., speeding, reckless driving).

This means that if you have a pre-nuptial agreement in place and you end up in court following the breakdown of your marriage, the judge is not bound by the terms of the pre-nuptial agreement. The only provision in Irish law is under sections 113 and 113A of the Succession Act 1965 (as amended) where a spouse or a civil partner can renounce his/her legal right share in a pre-nuptial agreement. Although they are not legally binding, there is nothing in Irish law which stops a couple planning to marry from having and signing a pre-nuptial agreement. Importantly, such agreements can serve as guides for the courts in judicial separation and divorce cases. If a pre-nuptial agreement makes \u2018proper provision\u2019 for each person it is more likely to be persuasive on the judge. Therefore, in situations where one party is likely to inherit a significant family farm or business, it will guide the judge in the divorce or judicial separation on what the parties\u2019 intentions were at the outset.",
