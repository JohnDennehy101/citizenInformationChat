This concept is often used within taxation laws to determine where an individual should pay taxes based on their residential status. Factors that contribute to determining one's ordinary residence are ties to a particular location (family, job), length of stay, and intent. In contrast, a domicile represents a person's permanent and lasting home, regardless of temporary absences from it. Both concepts play crucial roles in matters concerning immigration, social welfare benefits, and various legal cases across many countries.",

            "question": "What is the Vacant Property Refurbishment Grant?",
            "answer": "The Vacant Property Refurbishment Grant (VPRG) is designed to encourage private landlords and homeowners to renovate vacant properties for renting or selling purposes in designated areas. The grant provides financial assistance towards the cost of works required to meet minimum housing standards. The funding varies depending on location, property type, and scope of work undertaken. To be eligible, owners must have proof that they have purchased the property within three years prior or are currently liable for council tax at the time of application. Properties must also be genuinely vacant for six months or longer before starting the refurbishment process. Submitting all necessary documents including planning approvals if needed significantly increases chances of approval.",

This means that if you have a pre-nuptial agreement in place and you end up in court following the breakdown of your marriage, the judge is not bound by the terms of the pre-nuptial agreement. The only provision in Irish law is under sections 113 and 113A of the Succession Act 1965 (as amended) where a spouse or a civil partner can renounce his/her legal right share in a pre-nuptial agreement. Although they are not legally binding, there is nothing in Irish law which stops a couple planning to marry from having and signing a pre-nuptial agreement. Importantly, such agreements can serve as guides for the courts in judicial separation and divorce cases. If a pre-nuptial agreement makes \u2018proper provision\u2019 for each person it is more likely to be persuasive on the judge. Therefore, in situations where one party is likely to inherit a significant family farm or business, it will guide the judge in the divorce or judicial separation on what the parties\u2019 intentions were at the outset.",
