You can get a grant of up to \u20ac50,000 to renovate a vacant property and up to \u20ac70,000, if the property is derelict. You can get more if you are living on an off-shore island. And, there is an additional grant for expert conservation advice if you are refurbishing a vacant traditional farmhouse.

The only provision in Irish law is under sections 113 and 113A of the Succession Act 1965 (as amended) where a spouse or a civil partner can renounce his/her legal right share in a pre-nuptial agreement. Although they are not legally binding, there is nothing in Irish law which stops a couple planning to marry from having and signing a pre-nuptial agreement. Importantly, such agreements can serve as guides for the courts in judicial separation and divorce cases. If a pre-nuptial agreement makes \u2018proper provision\u2019 for each person it is more likely to be persuasive on the judge.
