It can also be used to renovate vacant and derelict properties that have not been used as residential properties before. However, this only applies if the non-residential properties were used for commercial or public use before and now have the correct planning permission. You can get the grant if you are refurbishing the vacant property so you can live there, or so you can rent the property out. You can get a grant of up to \u20ac50,000 to renovate a vacant property and up to \u20ac70,000, if the property is derelict. You can get more if you are living on an off-shore island. And, there is an additional grant for expert conservation advice if you are refurbishing a vacant traditional farmhouse. The Vacant Property Refurbishment Grant is funded by the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage through the Cro\u00ed C\u00f3naithe (Towns) Fund and you apply to your local authority. If you have questions about the grant or want to know if your property qualifies, you can: Read the FAQs about the grant Contact the Vacant Homes Officer in your local authority Contact the Housing Agency's Vacancy Helpline on vacancycampaign@housingagency.ie You can also find information on how to re-use old and vacant buildings in the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage\u2019s Bringing Back Homes (pdf) manual.",

Employers pay for the bike and equipment, and employees repay the cost through regular instalments from their gross salary.
