            "answer": "The Constitution of Ireland states that all persons born on its territory are citizens of Ireland at birth. The Constitution also provides for automatic acquisition of Irish citizenship by descent through parents who have acquired it by naturalisation under Irish law. Additionally, anyone who renounces their foreign citizenship and applies for Irish citizenship within 6 months of becoming aware of their right to apply must do so. There is no requirement for a person to have lived in Ireland to acquire Irish citizenship; however, they would be required to prove that they have resided there continuously for a certain period before applying.",

            "answer": "Ordinary residence refers to the place where someone intends to live permanently and has the intention of returning there after temporary stays elsewhere. It's different from the legal concept of domicile, which is a person's registered address for tax purposes. While both are important, they serve distinct functions in law and society. The distinction between the two is crucial for understanding how laws treat individuals who move frequently or temporarily reside away from their usual living places. Understanding this difference helps clarify issues related to property rights, taxation, inheritance, and other legal matters. Links that provide further details on this topic might be helpful resources. \n\nIn summary, ordinary residence is about having a permanent home, while domicile is more about being legally registered at a specific location for tax purposes.",

A genuine redundancy is one where your employer has a real business reason to make you redundant. Reasons for redundancy include: Financial difficulties within the business: for example, your employer needs to cut costs and this means staff numbers must be reduced. Lack of work: for example, your employer no longer needs or has a reduced need for employees with your skills or new technology has made your job unnecessary. Reorganisation within the business: for example, your employer has decided to carry on the business with fewer or no staff or the job you do no longer exists. Business closure: the business is closing down or moving.",
            "question": "What counts as genuine redundancy?",
            "answer": "Genuine redundancy occurs when there is no alternative employment available for an employee and they are laid off. This type of redundancy typically involves employees who have been employed at a company for many years and whose positions cannot be filled by other workers due to changes in technology, market demands, or organizational restructuring. In contrast, forced redundancy happens when employees are dismissed because their roles become redundant after the introduction of new technologies or processes that reduce labor costs. Forced redundancy does not involve long-term commitments or significant personal investment from the employee, making it more likely to result in unemployment. To determine if someone qualifies for genuine redundancy, companies must provide evidence of the inability to fill the position through internal recruitment or external hires.",

And, there is an additional grant for expert conservation advice if you are refurbishing a vacant traditional farmhouse. The Vacant Property Refurbishment Grant is funded by the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage through the Cro\u00ed C\u00f3naithe (Towns) Fund and you apply to your local authority. If you have questions about the grant or want to know if your property qualifies, you can: Read the FAQs about the grant Contact the Vacant Homes Officer in your local authority Contact the Housing Agency's Vacancy Helpline on vacancycampaign@housingagency.ie You can also find information on how to re-use old and vacant buildings in the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage\u2019s Bringing Back Homes (pdf) manual.",
            "question": "What is the Vacant Property Refurbishment Grant?",
            "answer": "The Vacant Property Refurbishment Grant (VPRG) is a government program that provides grants for property owners who are willing and able to renovate their vacant properties into affordable housing units. The VPRG aims to increase housing availability by converting empty lots, undeveloped land, and other unused spaces into homes. This initiative supports local communities by revitalizing underutilized areas and creating opportunities for low- and moderate-income individuals to own or rent a home. To be eligible for the grant, applicants must meet certain criteria related to the property's condition and their ability to complete the renovation project successfully. The process typically involves submitting an application, which undergoes review by local authorities before funds are allocated.",

The only provision in Irish law is under sections 113 and 113A of the Succession Act 1965 (as amended) where a spouse or a civil partner can renounce his/her legal right share in a pre-nuptial agreement. Although they are not legally binding, there is nothing in Irish law which stops a couple planning to marry from having and signing a pre-nuptial agreement. Importantly, such agreements can serve as guides for the courts in judicial separation and divorce cases. If a pre-nuptial agreement makes \u2018proper provision\u2019 for each person it is more likely to be persuasive on the judge.

In some places, they are considered voidable or unenforceable due to lack of fairness or undue influence; others recognize them as valid and enforceable under specific conditions. For example, in the United States, pre-nuptial agreements must be fair and based on equal negotiation, while in other countries like Germany, they require more stringent procedural requirements.",
