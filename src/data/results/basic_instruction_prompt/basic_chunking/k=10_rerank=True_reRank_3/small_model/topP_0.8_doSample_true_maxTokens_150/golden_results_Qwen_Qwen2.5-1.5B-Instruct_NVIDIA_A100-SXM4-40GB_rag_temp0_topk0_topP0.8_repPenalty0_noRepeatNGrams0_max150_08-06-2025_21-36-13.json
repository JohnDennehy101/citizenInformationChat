Employers can buy a bicycle and its accessories up to \u20ac3,000 for their employees under this scheme, which employees can then repay from their gross salary. The scheme also covers additional safety equipment like helmets and lights. Employers who participate in the scheme must offer it to all their employees and cannot refuse participation based on whether the employee works independently or has full-time employment. Under the scheme, employees save on the cost of purchasing a new bicycle and related equipment by deducting the payments from their gross salary before tax, PRSI, and USC are applied.",
