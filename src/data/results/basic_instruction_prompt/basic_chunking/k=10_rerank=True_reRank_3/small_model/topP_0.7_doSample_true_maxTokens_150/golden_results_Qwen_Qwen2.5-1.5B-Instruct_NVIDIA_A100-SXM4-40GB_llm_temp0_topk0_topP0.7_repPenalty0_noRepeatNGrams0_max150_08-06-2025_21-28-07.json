This concept is crucial in determining tax residency and nationality of individuals who are not citizens of their country of usual residence. The term also plays a role in immigration laws, as it defines the location from which legal claims can be made on behalf of foreign nationals seeking citizenship. In summary, ordinary residence is a fundamental principle that helps clarify the status of people's long-term living arrangements within a country. To determine if someone meets the criteria for ordinary residence, authorities consider factors such as duration of stay, intention to return, and overall stability of the living situation.",

A genuine redundancy is one where your employer has a real business reason to make you redundant. Reasons for redundancy include: Financial difficulties within the business: for example, your employer needs to cut costs and this means staff numbers must be reduced. Lack of work: for example, your employer no longer needs or has a reduced need for employees with your skills or new technology has made your job unnecessary. Reorganisation within the business: for example, your employer has decided to carry on the business with fewer or no staff or the job you do no longer exists. Business closure: the business is closing down or moving.",
            "question": "What counts as genuine redundancy?",
            "answer": "Genuine redundancy refers to situations where there is no alternative employment available for an employee due to factors such as automation, restructuring, or industry-wide changes. This type of redundancy involves layoffs and severance payments that are necessary because the organization cannot operate without certain roles anymore. It contrasts with false redundancy, which occurs when employees are laid off based on poor performance or lack of productivity, even if they have skills that could be used elsewhere within the company. The key distinction lies in the necessity versus convenience of laying off workers. To determine if a situation qualifies as genuine redundancy, it's important to consider whether the layoff is mandated by external market forces rather than internal organizational decisions.",

These cards are often required for reimbursement purposes and help ensure that patients receive proper documentation of their visits.

However, this only applies if the non-residential properties were used for commercial or public use before and now have the correct planning permission. You can get the grant if you are refurbishing the vacant property so you can live there, or so you can rent the property out. You can get a grant of up to \u20ac50,000 to renovate a vacant property and up to \u20ac70,000, if the property is derelict. You can get more if you are living on an off-shore island. And, there is an additional grant for expert conservation advice if you are refurbishing a vacant traditional farmhouse. The Vacant Property Refurbishment Grant is funded by the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage through the Cro\u00ed C\u00f3naithe (Towns) Fund and you apply to your local authority. If you have questions about the grant or want to know if your property qualifies, you can: Read the FAQs about the grant Contact the Vacant Homes Officer in your local authority Contact the Housing Agency's Vacancy Helpline on vacancycampaign@housingagency.ie You can also find information on how to re-use old and vacant buildings in the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage\u2019s Bringing Back Homes (pdf) manual.",

This means that if you have a pre-nuptial agreement in place and you end up in court following the breakdown of your marriage, the judge is not bound by the terms of the pre-nuptial agreement. The only provision in Irish law is under sections 113 and 113A of the Succession Act 1965 (as amended) where a spouse or a civil partner can renounce his/her legal right share in a pre-nuptial agreement. Although they are not legally binding, there is nothing in Irish law which stops a couple planning to marry from having and signing a pre-nuptial agreement. Importantly, such agreements can serve as guides for the courts in judicial separation and divorce cases. If a pre-nuptial agreement makes \u2018proper provision\u2019 for each person it is more likely to be persuasive on the judge. Therefore, in situations where one party is likely to inherit a significant family farm or business, it will guide the judge in the divorce or judicial separation on what the parties\u2019 intentions were at the outset.",

They typically involve provisions regarding property division, alimony payments, and support obligations. These agreements are legally binding under most jurisdictions when they are entered into voluntarily by both parties without undue influence or duress. However, their enforceability can vary significantly between different countries and states within the United States due to varying laws on contract formation and enforcement. In some cases, courts have ruled that such agreements may not be valid if one party was coerced into signing them. It's important for individuals considering entering into a pre-nuptial agreement to consult with a lawyer who specializes in family law to ensure that it meets all necessary legal requirements and protections.",

            "question": "What is the Cycle to Work Scheme?",
            "answer": "The Cycle to Work Scheme (CTWS) was introduced by the UK government as part of its commitment to encourage cycling and sustainable transport. It allows employees to purchase specialist cycle equipment such as helmets, lights, locks, and protective clothing directly from their employer's supplier without paying VAT on the cost of the items purchased through the scheme. The scheme provides financial support for eligible employees who choose to use public transport instead of driving to work, aiming to reduce carbon emissions and promote healthier lifestyles. While the CTWS has been successful in increasing cycling among employees, it also faces challenges related to affordability, availability of products, and compliance with tax regulations.",

There are electronic displays telling you the time of the next tram at every Luas stop. In addition, there are electronic displays and announcements informing passengers of the next stop on board every tram. Special services operate during Christmas, New Year and on other occasions.",
            "question": "What are the operating hours and frequency of the Luas?",
            "answer": "The Luas operates on a schedule that includes both peak hour and off-peak periods. During peak hours, which typically occur from 7:00 AM to 9:00 AM and from 5:00 PM to 8:00 PM, trains run every 6 minutes between the central business district (CBD) stations. Off-peak times, when there is less demand for public transport, see trains running every 10 to 12 minutes. The frequency varies depending on the specific route and station pairs, so it's best to check the latest timetable or contact the Luas customer service for detailed information. Additionally, Luas buses also operate during rush hours, providing more frequent service than the tram system.",
