It can also be used to renovate vacant and derelict properties that have not been used as residential properties before. However, this only applies if the non-residential properties were used for commercial or public use before and now have the correct planning permission. You can get the grant if you are refurbishing the vacant property so you can live there, or so you can rent the property out. You can get a grant of up to \u20ac50,000 to renovate a vacant property and up to \u20ac70,000, if the property is derelict. You can get more if you are living on an off-shore island. And, there is an additional grant for expert conservation advice if you are refurbishing a vacant traditional farmhouse. The Vacant Property Refurbishment Grant is funded by the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage through the Cro\u00ed C\u00f3naithe (Towns) Fund and you apply to your local authority.

The grant can be used for various types of work depending on the size and condition of the property. For example, it can cover demolition work, derelict top-up grants, superstructure works, external completions, internal completions, skirtings, fascias, soffits, rainwater goods, roofing, tiling and waterproof finishes, painting and decorating, and roof finishes. However, the maximum amount allowed for each type of work is based on a two-storey, 3-bedroom semi-detached home. The grant does not cover completely demolishing a property and rebuilding a new one.",
