            "question": "Who is entitled to Irish citizenship?",
            "answer": "Irish citizenship is granted based on one of three criteria:\n\n- Birth within the Republic of Ireland\n- Naturalization after residing there for 7 years\n- Adoption by Irish parents\n\nThe first two methods are for natural citizens, while the third applies to those adopted into the Irish family. To be considered eligible for Irish citizenship through adoption, the adoptive parents must meet certain conditions regarding nationality and residency requirements. The process involves applying at the Central Applications Office (CAO) and providing documentation that proves the adoptee's right to Irish citizenship. It's important to note that the eligibility criteria and application procedures can vary slightly depending on the specific circumstances of each case.",

Understanding one's ordinary residence is important for various personal and legal matters, including tax reporting, insurance coverage, and real estate transactions. To determine one's ordinary residence, individuals should consider factors like their primary living arrangements, sources of income, and long-term plans regarding housing.",

Lack of work: for example, your employer no longer needs or has a reduced need for employees with your skills or new technology has made your job unnecessary.

This card serves as a portable reference tool that allows patients to carry essential health information with them during consultations. However, it's worth noting that while this concept might seem convenient, its use varies among healthcare systems globally, and some countries have different approaches to managing patient records and communication between healthcare providers.",

It can also be used to renovate vacant and derelict properties that have not been used as residential properties before. However, this only applies if the non-residential properties were used for commercial or public use before and now have the correct planning permission. You can get the grant if you are refurbishing the vacant property so you can live there, or so you can rent the property out. You can get a grant of up to \u20ac50,000 to renovate a vacant property and up to \u20ac70,000, if the property is derelict. You can get more if you are living on an off-shore island. And, there is an additional grant for expert conservation advice if you are refurbishing a vacant traditional farmhouse. The Vacant Property Refurbishment Grant is funded by the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage through the Cro\u00ed C\u00f3naithe (Towns) Fund and you apply to your local authority. If you have questions about the grant or want to know if your property qualifies, you can: Read the FAQs about the grant Contact the Vacant Homes Officer in your local authority Contact the Housing Agency's Vacancy Helpline on vacancycampaign@housingagency.ie You can also find information on how to re-use old and vacant buildings in the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage\u2019s Bringing Back Homes (pdf) manual.",
            "question": "What is the Vacant Property Refurbishment Grant?",
            "answer": "The Vacant Property Refurbishment Grant (VPRG) is a program established by the Queensland Government for landlords who have vacant properties and wish to refurbish them into affordable rental units. The grant provides funding to eligible applicants through a series of stages that typically involve property assessment, feasibility studies, planning applications, and construction work. The total amount of funding available varies annually based on government allocations, which are reviewed each financial year. To qualify for the VPRG, applicants must meet specific criteria related to the condition of the property and their ability to undertake necessary repairs and renovations. While there isn\u2019t a fixed annual budget, recent reports indicate the government allocates approximately $5 million per annum for this initiative.",

This means that if you have a pre-nuptial agreement in place and you end up in court following the breakdown of your marriage, the judge is not bound by the terms of the pre-nuptial agreement. The only provision in Irish law is under sections 113 and 113A of the Succession Act 1965 (as amended) where a spouse or a civil partner can renounce his/her legal right share in a pre-nuptial agreement. Although they are not legally binding, there is nothing in Irish law which stops a couple planning to marry from having and signing a pre-nuptial agreement. Importantly, such agreements can serve as guides for the courts in judicial separation and divorce cases. If a pre-nuptial agreement makes \u2018proper provision\u2019 for each person it is more likely to be persuasive on the judge. Therefore, in situations where one party is likely to inherit a significant family farm or business, it will guide the judge in the divorce or judicial separation on what the parties\u2019 intentions were at the outset.",

These agreements have been subject to varying degrees of legal recognition and enforcement across different jurisdictions due to concerns about fairness, equity, and potential loopholes. In some countries, such as the United States, there has been significant judicial intervention and legislative changes aimed at standardizing the process and ensuring more equitable outcomes for both parties. In other areas, like Germany, pre-nuptial agreements are widely accepted and enforceable without needing additional court approval.

If you are self-employed, you cannot take part in the Cycle to Work Scheme unless you pay PRSI as an employee in addition to your self-employed work.",
            "question": "What is the Cycle to Work Scheme?",
            "answer": "The Cycle to Work Scheme allows employees of UK companies and public sector organisations to purchase new cycle equipment from participating manufacturers at a reduced price by claiming tax relief on their salary. This scheme was introduced as part of the Workplace Transport Options scheme (WTOS) in 2007. The aim of the scheme is to encourage staff to use bicycles for commuting purposes instead of cars, which could reduce traffic congestion and improve air quality. Since its introduction, over \u00a31 billion has been claimed under the Cycle to Work Scheme, benefiting thousands of people across the country. While not every company offers this scheme, many do, and it's worth checking if your employer participates before purchasing anything.",
