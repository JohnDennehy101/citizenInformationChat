            "answer": "The right of Irish citizenship is not automatic and depends on the individual's relationship to someone who already holds Irish nationality. The main categories are:\n\n- Birth within the Republic of Ireland\n- Birth outside the country where parents have Irish citizenship\n- Naturalization by descent from citizens of the Republic of Ireland\n\nAdditionally, certain groups like British subjects (including those born in the UK) or Commonwealth citizens who meet specific criteria may also be eligible for Irish citizenship. These provisions aim to maintain strong ties between Ireland and its former colonies while welcoming new immigrants. For detailed eligibility requirements, one should refer to the Citizenship Act 2015, which governs how individuals acquire Irish citizenship.",

            "answer": "Ordinary residence refers to the place where someone lives primarily and regularly for more than half of their time. It's typically used in legal contexts, such as determining citizenship status, inheritance rights, property taxes, and immigration eligibility. The term doesn't require a specific address; it\u2019s about the person's primary living situation rather than a fixed location. To determine one's ordinary residence, authorities often consider factors like how long they've lived there, their daily routine, and any agreements or contracts that establish a permanent home. This concept varies across different jurisdictions, so understanding local laws is crucial when dealing with matters related to residency. Links to further resources on this topic are provided at the end of this explanation.",

            "ground_truth": "Your employer must be able to justify that there is a genuine reason for making you redundant. A genuine redundancy is one where your employer has a real business reason to make you redundant. Reasons for redundancy include: Financial difficulties within the business: for example, your employer needs to cut costs and this means staff numbers must be reduced. Lack of work: for example, your employer no longer needs or has a reduced need for employees with your skills or new technology has made your job unnecessary. Reorganisation within the business: for example, your employer has decided to carry on the business with fewer or no staff or the job you do no longer exists. Business closure: the business is closing down or moving.",
            "question": "What counts as genuine redundancy?",
            "answer": "Genuine redundancy is when an employee's position becomes unnecessary due to changes in business operations or technology that require fewer employees. This contrasts with formal redundancies where there are no actual vacancies and layoffs occur without proper notice periods. To qualify for genuine redundancy, an employee must be informed of their potential dismissal well in advance (typically 90 days), receive severance pay, and have the opportunity to seek alternative employment. The key difference lies in whether the position was eliminated because it became obsolete or if the company decided to cut costs by reducing staff. Genuine redundancy ensures fair treatment under labor laws while formal redundancies often involve less procedural oversight. Both types of redundancy aim to minimize disruption and ensure smooth transitions within the organization.",

However, this only applies if the non-residential properties were used for commercial or public use before and now have the correct planning permission. You can get the grant if you are refurbishing the vacant property so you can live there, or so you can rent the property out. You can get a grant of up to \u20ac50,000 to renovate a vacant property and up to \u20ac70,000, if the property is derelict. You can get more if you are living on an off-shore island. And, there is an additional grant for expert conservation advice if you are refurbishing a vacant traditional farmhouse. The Vacant Property Refurbishment Grant is funded by the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage through the Cro\u00ed C\u00f3naithe (Towns) Fund and you apply to your local authority. If you have questions about the grant or want to know if your property qualifies, you can: Read the FAQs about the grant Contact the Vacant Homes Officer in your local authority Contact the Housing Agency's Vacancy Helpline on vacancycampaign@housingagency.ie You can also find information on how to re-use old and vacant buildings in the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage\u2019s Bringing Back Homes (pdf) manual.",
            "question": "What is the Vacant Property Refurbishment Grant?",
            "answer": "The Vacant Property Refurbishment Grant (VPRG) is a government-funded program designed to assist property owners who are facing financial difficulties due to vacant properties on their land. The primary purpose of this grant is to help these individuals improve and maintain their properties so that they can be sold at a profit or rented out for income generation. This initiative aims to create more housing options by converting empty lots into productive assets through renovations such as building homes, creating commercial spaces, or enhancing infrastructure. By providing financial assistance and technical support, the VPRG seeks to encourage responsible real estate investment while addressing urban blight and promoting economic development.",

The only provision in Irish law is under sections 113 and 113A of the Succession Act 1965 (as amended) where a spouse or a civil partner can renounce his/her legal right share in a pre-nuptial agreement. Although they are not legally binding, there is nothing in Irish law which stops a couple planning to marry from having and signing a pre-nuptial agreement. Importantly, such agreements can serve as guides for the courts in judicial separation and divorce cases. If a pre-nuptial agreement makes \u2018proper provision\u2019 for each person it is more likely to be persuasive on the judge.

If you are self-employed, you cannot take part in the Cycle to Work Scheme unless you pay PRSI as an employee in addition to your self-employed work.",
            "question": "What is the Cycle to Work Scheme?",
            "answer": "The Cycle to Work Scheme (CTWS) was introduced by the UK government as part of its commitment to encourage people to cycle for health and environmental reasons. The scheme allows employees to purchase a new bicycle, bike equipment, or accessories from participating retailers without paying income tax on the value of the item if it's used primarily for commuting purposes. This reduces financial barriers to cycling, making it more accessible for those who might not otherwise afford such expenses. To qualify under CTWS, items must be used mainly for travel to work, not just for personal use. Participation is voluntary, and employers are encouraged to offer their staff this benefit as a means to promote healthier lifestyles and reduce carbon emissions.",
