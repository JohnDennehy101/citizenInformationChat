            "question": "Who is entitled to Irish citizenship?",
            "answer": "Irish citizenship is not inherited; it must be actively sought and obtained through certain legal means. The most common ways to acquire Irish citizenship are by birth within Ireland's territory, descent from parents who were Irish citizens, or naturalization. Additionally, Irish citizens have the right to pass on their citizenship to their children if they meet specific conditions regarding age and residency requirements. However, there are exceptions for those born outside of Ireland to Irish parents where Irish citizenship is automatically conferred at birth.",

This means that if you have a pre-nuptial agreement in place and you end up in court following the breakdown of your marriage, the judge is not bound by the terms of the pre-nuptial agreement. The only provision in Irish law is under sections 113 and 113A of the Succession Act 1965 (as amended) where a spouse or a civil partner can renounce his/her legal right share in a pre-nuptial agreement. Although they are not legally binding, there is nothing in Irish law which stops a couple planning to marry from having and signing a pre-nuptial agreement. Importantly, such agreements can serve as guides for the courts in judicial separation and divorce cases. If a pre-nuptial agreement makes \u2018proper provision\u2019 for each person it is more likely to be persuasive on the judge. Therefore, in situations where one party is likely to inherit a significant family farm or business, it will guide the judge in the divorce or judicial separation on what the parties\u2019 intentions were at the outset.",

In many jurisdictions, such as the United States and Canada, pre-nuptial agreements are generally recognized as valid under state law unless one spouse has been coerced into entering into the agreement against their will. The validity of pre-nuptial agreements varies widely between different countries and states within the same country.",
