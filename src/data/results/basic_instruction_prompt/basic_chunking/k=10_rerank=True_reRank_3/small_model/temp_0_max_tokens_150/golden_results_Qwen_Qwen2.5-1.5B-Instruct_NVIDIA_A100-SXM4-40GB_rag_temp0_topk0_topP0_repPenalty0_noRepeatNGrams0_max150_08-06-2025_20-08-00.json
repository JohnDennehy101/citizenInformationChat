It can also be used to renovate vacant and derelict properties that have not been used as residential properties before. However, this only applies if the non-residential properties were used for commercial or public use before and now have the correct planning permission. You can get the grant if you are refurbishing the vacant property so you can live there, or so you can rent the property out. You can get a grant of up to \u20ac50,000 to renovate a vacant property and up to \u20ac70,000, if the property is derelict. You can get more if you are living on an off-shore island. And, there is an additional grant for expert conservation advice if you are refurbishing a vacant traditional farmhouse. The Vacant Property Refurbishment Grant is funded by the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage through the Cro\u00ed C\u00f3naithe (Towns) Fund and you apply to your local authority.

Your employer pays for a new bike and then you repay the cost of regular instalments from your gross (overall) salary. You do not have to pay tax, PRSI or the Universal Social Charge on your repayments. Not every employer takes part in the scheme. However, if they do, they must offer it to all their employees.

The employees can then repay this cost from their gross salary. This helps reduce the financial burden on both the employer and the employee by allowing them to benefit from the purchase of a new bike while still contributing towards its cost. Under this scheme, there are specific limits set for each type of bike purchased, such as \u20ac3,000 for cargo and electric cargo bikes, \u20ac1,500 for electric pedal-assist and electrically assisted bikes, and \u20ac1,250 for other types of bikes.",
