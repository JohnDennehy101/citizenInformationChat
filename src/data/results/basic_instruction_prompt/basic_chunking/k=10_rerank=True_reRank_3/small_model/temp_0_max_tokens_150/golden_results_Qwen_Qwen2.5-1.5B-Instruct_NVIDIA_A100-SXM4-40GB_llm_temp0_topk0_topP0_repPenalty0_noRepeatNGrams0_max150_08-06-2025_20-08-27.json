            "question": "Who is entitled to Irish citizenship?",
            "answer": "Irish citizenship is granted through naturalization and descent from Irish parents. Naturalized citizens are those who have been granted Irish citizenship by law after living in Ireland for at least seven years and meeting other requirements such as good character and knowledge of the Irish language. Descendants of Irish ancestors who settled in Ireland before 1801 are also eligible for Irish citizenship if they meet certain criteria related to their ancestry and residence in Ireland. The process of applying for Irish citizenship involves submitting an application form, paying fees, and undergoing a background check. It's important to note that while there are no specific restrictions on nationality, individuals must renounce their previous citizenship (if applicable) before becoming an Irish citizen.",

            "question": "What is ordinary residence?",
            "answer": "Ordinary residence refers to the place where someone has lived for a significant portion of their life and considers themselves to be permanently settled. It's not necessarily the person's legal domicile (where they have legal rights) or the location where they pay taxes, although it often aligns closely with those factors. The concept is important in various contexts such as property law, inheritance laws, and tax regulations. For example, if a person owns real estate in multiple locations, the primary residence would typically be considered their ordinary residence based on how long they've been living there and how much time they spend there compared to other residences. This distinction helps clarify who has ownership rights over certain properties and ensures that inheritances are distributed according to the individual's true home base.",

Lack of work: for example, your employer no longer needs or has a reduced need for employees with your skills or new technology has made your job unnecessary.

This allows GPs to quickly access patient information and maintain continuity of care without needing to rely solely on memory or incomplete records. Additionally, it helps streamline administrative processes and ensures that all necessary documents are available when needed. While not universally mandated across all countries, many healthcare systems recognize the importance of having such cards to enhance efficiency and accuracy in patient management.

However, this only applies if the non-residential properties were used for commercial or public use before and now have the correct planning permission. You can get the grant if you are refurbishing the vacant property so you can live there, or so you can rent the property out. You can get a grant of up to \u20ac50,000 to renovate a vacant property and up to \u20ac70,000, if the property is derelict. You can get more if you are living on an off-shore island. And, there is an additional grant for expert conservation advice if you are refurbishing a vacant traditional farmhouse. The Vacant Property Refurbishment Grant is funded by the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage through the Cro\u00ed C\u00f3naithe (Towns) Fund and you apply to your local authority. If you have questions about the grant or want to know if your property qualifies, you can: Read the FAQs about the grant Contact the Vacant Homes Officer in your local authority Contact the Housing Agency's Vacancy Helpline on vacancycampaign@housingagency.ie You can also find information on how to re-use old and vacant buildings in the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage\u2019s Bringing Back Homes (pdf) manual.",
            "question": "What is the Vacant Property Refurbishment Grant?",
            "answer": "The Vacant Property Refurbishment Grant (VPRG) is a program that provides grants for property owners who wish to renovate and improve their vacant properties. The grant aims to help communities by revitalizing underutilized spaces through improvements such as adding amenities like sidewalks, landscaping, and public art installations. Eligible applicants must meet certain criteria, including having a valid business license, being able to demonstrate financial need, and agreeing to maintain the improved property after completion of the project. The VPRG was established by the State of California's Department of Housing and Community Development (DHCD) and has been funded since 2015. It offers both general assistance grants and targeted grants aimed at specific neighborhoods or projects.",

This means that if you have a pre-nuptial agreement in place and you end up in court following the breakdown of your marriage, the judge is not bound by the terms of the pre-nuptial agreement. The only provision in Irish law is under sections 113 and 113A of the Succession Act 1965 (as amended) where a spouse or a civil partner can renounce his/her legal right share in a pre-nuptial agreement. Although they are not legally binding, there is nothing in Irish law which stops a couple planning to marry from having and signing a pre-nuptial agreement. Importantly, such agreements can serve as guides for the courts in judicial separation and divorce cases. If a pre-nuptial agreement makes \u2018proper provision\u2019 for each person it is more likely to be persuasive on the judge. Therefore, in situations where one party is likely to inherit a significant family farm or business, it will guide the judge in the divorce or judicial separation on what the parties\u2019 intentions were at the outset.",

            "answer": "Pre-nuptial agreements are contracts that individuals enter into before marriage to address issues related to property division and support upon divorce. They typically outline how assets will be divided if one spouse files for divorce. These agreements are generally considered valid under most state laws as long as they meet certain requirements, such as being entered into voluntarily by both parties without undue influence from either party. However, there are some exceptions where courts might not enforce them, particularly when they involve fraud or coercion. In cases where enforcement is challenged, courts often look at factors like whether the agreement was fair and voluntary, and whether it was made after full disclosure of all relevant financial information.",

            "question": "What is the Cycle to Work Scheme?",
            "answer": "The Cycle to Work Scheme (CTWS) was introduced by the UK government in 2001 as part of its commitment to encourage cycling and reduce carbon emissions. It allows employees to purchase cycle-related equipment such as bicycles, helmets, locks, lights, and safety gear from participating employers at a discounted price. The scheme aims to promote sustainable transport options while providing financial incentives for individuals to adopt healthier modes of transportation. Employers must meet certain criteria to participate in the CTWS, including offering a minimum discount on qualifying items and ensuring that their workplace environment supports cycling.",
