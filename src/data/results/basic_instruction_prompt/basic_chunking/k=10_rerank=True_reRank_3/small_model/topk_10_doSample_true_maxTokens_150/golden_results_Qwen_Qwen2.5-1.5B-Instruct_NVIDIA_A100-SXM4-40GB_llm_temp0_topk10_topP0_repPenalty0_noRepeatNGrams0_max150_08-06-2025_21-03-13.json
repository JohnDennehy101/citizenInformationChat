            "answer": "Ordinary residence refers to the location where someone intends to establish long-term residency and has a stable place of living. It's different from legal domicile, which involves having a permanent home within a country for tax purposes. The term can also refer to the place where someone lives primarily or regularly, often used by landlords when renting out properties. For example, if someone moves back to their hometown after being away for several years, it might be considered their ordinary residence upon return. To determine whether a person has established an ordinary residence, authorities typically consider factors such as the frequency of visits, duration of stays, and intent to stay permanently. In some cases, people may have more than one ordinary residence depending on various circumstances.",

Lack of work: for example, your employer no longer needs or has a reduced need for employees with your skills or new technology has made your job unnecessary.

            "question": "What counts as genuine redundancy?",
            "answer": "Genuine redundancy is defined as job loss that occurs when there are fewer jobs available than applicants for those positions. This type of redundancy typically involves layoffs and other forms of involuntary termination due to economic factors such as downsizing or restructuring. It contrasts with voluntary redundancy, which happens when employees voluntarily leave their jobs without being fired. The key characteristic of genuine redundancy is its necessity arising from external market forces rather than individual choices by workers. \n\nThe process of identifying genuine redundancy often involves several steps:\n\n- **Job Analysis**: Conducting thorough job analysis to understand the nature and requirements of each position.\n- **Market Research**: Gathering data on labor markets to determine if there are enough suitable candidates for the remaining jobs.",

            "answer": "A GP visit card is a document that allows patients to see their General Practitioner (GP) for free within a specific time frame. This card is often used by students who are required to attend regular appointments as part of their academic program. The purpose is to ensure that students receive adequate medical care without having to pay out-of-pocket costs. While it's not common practice anymore due to increased healthcare costs and reimbursement policies, this system was historically used to provide access to primary care services more affordably. However, with modern healthcare systems, many universities now require students to pay for GP visits through student health insurance plans instead. Therefore, while the concept remains valid for historical purposes, its practical application has evolved significantly over recent years.",

It can also be used to renovate vacant and derelict properties that have not been used as residential properties before. However, this only applies if the non-residential properties were used for commercial or public use before and now have the correct planning permission. You can get the grant if you are refurbishing the vacant property so you can live there, or so you can rent the property out. You can get a grant of up to \u20ac50,000 to renovate a vacant property and up to \u20ac70,000, if the property is derelict. You can get more if you are living on an off-shore island. And, there is an additional grant for expert conservation advice if you are refurbishing a vacant traditional farmhouse. The Vacant Property Refurbishment Grant is funded by the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage through the Cro\u00ed C\u00f3naithe (Towns) Fund and you apply to your local authority. If you have questions about the grant or want to know if your property qualifies, you can: Read the FAQs about the grant Contact the Vacant Homes Officer in your local authority Contact the Housing Agency's Vacancy Helpline on vacancycampaign@housingagency.ie You can also find information on how to re-use old and vacant buildings in the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage\u2019s Bringing Back Homes (pdf) manual.",
            "question": "What is the Vacant Property Refurbishment Grant?",
            "answer": "The Vacant Property Refurbishment Grant (VPRG) was introduced by the Australian Government in 2018 as part of its National Partnership Agreement on Regional Development. This program aims to support the refurbishment and redevelopment of vacant properties across regional Australia. The VPRG provides financial assistance to property owners who wish to convert their empty homes into affordable housing options for low- and middle-income households. Eligible applicants must meet certain criteria, including having occupied the property for at least two years prior to application. The grant covers costs associated with renovations, such as structural improvements, energy efficiency upgrades, and landscaping. To apply, interested parties typically need to submit documentation proving ownership of the property and details about proposed renovations.",

In some cases, such as maternity leave or paternity leave, the law may mandate specific amounts of leave.

Drivers need to keep track of their point total and pay them off within a specified time frame to avoid suspension of their license. This system encourages drivers to drive safely and reduces the likelihood of serious accidents caused by impaired judgment due to accumulated penalties.

This means that if you have a pre-nuptial agreement in place and you end up in court following the breakdown of your marriage, the judge is not bound by the terms of the pre-nuptial agreement. The only provision in Irish law is under sections 113 and 113A of the Succession Act 1965 (as amended) where a spouse or a civil partner can renounce his/her legal right share in a pre-nuptial agreement. Although they are not legally binding, there is nothing in Irish law which stops a couple planning to marry from having and signing a pre-nuptial agreement. Importantly, such agreements can serve as guides for the courts in judicial separation and divorce cases. If a pre-nuptial agreement makes \u2018proper provision\u2019 for each person it is more likely to be persuasive on the judge. Therefore, in situations where one party is likely to inherit a significant family farm or business, it will guide the judge in the divorce or judicial separation on what the parties\u2019 intentions were at the outset.",

These agreements must be fair and equitable for both parties involved, typically requiring full disclosure from each spouse about their financial situation. They often include provisions related to assets, debts, income, and other matters specific to the couple's circumstances. In most jurisdictions, courts generally uphold pre-nuptial agreements unless there was fraud or duress involved. However, some states have enacted laws limiting or prohibiting them altogether due to concerns over fairness and equality in the distribution of marital property.",
