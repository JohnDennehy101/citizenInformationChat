            "answer": "Irish citizens are those who have been born in Ireland, whose parents were Irish citizens at the time of their birth, or who apply for and receive Irish citizenship through naturalization. The Constitution of Ireland guarantees that every person has the right to be considered as an Irish citizen if they meet certain criteria, such as being born in Ireland, having lived there continuously since the age of 16, or being married to an Irish citizen. However, not everyone automatically becomes an Irish citizen upon meeting these criteria; some specific conditions must also be met. For example, children born outside of Ireland to Irish parents do not automatically become Irish citizens unless one parent was living in Ireland when the child was born.",

The concept helps determine tax liability, insurance coverage, and voting rights based on where someone lives permanently. For example, if someone moves to a new city for work but continues to visit their hometown occasionally, that hometown would likely be considered their ordinary residence. This distinction is crucial in various aspects of personal and financial planning.

A genuine redundancy is one where your employer has a real business reason to make you redundant. Reasons for redundancy include: Financial difficulties within the business: for example, your employer needs to cut costs and this means staff numbers must be reduced. Lack of work: for example, your employer no longer needs or has a reduced need for employees with your skills or new technology has made your job unnecessary. Reorganisation within the business: for example, your employer has decided to carry on the business with fewer or no staff or the job you do no longer exists. Business closure: the business is closing down or moving.",
            "question": "What counts as genuine redundancy?",
            "answer": "Genuine redundancy is when there are no alternatives and all employees must be laid off. It's not just about cost-cutting; it involves ensuring that everyone loses their job if they're unable to do another job. This type of redundancy requires careful planning and coordination among employers and unions. The term 'genuine' implies that this situation is unavoidable due to structural changes in the company, such as downsizing or restructuring. In contrast, fake redundancies might involve temporary layoffs for budget cuts, which could still allow some people to return once the economy improves. The key difference lies in the certainty of losing one's job versus uncertainty or the possibility of finding alternative employment.",

However, this only applies if the non-residential properties were used for commercial or public use before and now have the correct planning permission. You can get the grant if you are refurbishing the vacant property so you can live there, or so you can rent the property out. You can get a grant of up to \u20ac50,000 to renovate a vacant property and up to \u20ac70,000, if the property is derelict. You can get more if you are living on an off-shore island. And, there is an additional grant for expert conservation advice if you are refurbishing a vacant traditional farmhouse. The Vacant Property Refurbishment Grant is funded by the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage through the Cro\u00ed C\u00f3naithe (Towns) Fund and you apply to your local authority. If you have questions about the grant or want to know if your property qualifies, you can: Read the FAQs about the grant Contact the Vacant Homes Officer in your local authority Contact the Housing Agency's Vacancy Helpline on vacancycampaign@housingagency.ie You can also find information on how to re-use old and vacant buildings in the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage\u2019s Bringing Back Homes (pdf) manual.",
            "question": "What is the Vacant Property Refurbishment Grant?",
            "answer": "The Vacant Property Refurbishment Grant (VPRG) is a program that provides grants to help property owners renovate and restore vacant properties. It aims to increase housing stock by revitalizing abandoned buildings into affordable homes for low-income families. The grant covers costs such as structural repairs, improvements, and renovations of vacant properties. Eligible applicants must meet certain criteria, including having ownership interest in the property, being able to demonstrate financial need, and complying with local zoning regulations. Applications are typically reviewed on a first-come, first-served basis, though there may be some waiting periods due to funding constraints. The VPRG has been instrumental in addressing urban blight and providing much-needed housing solutions for those in need.",

The only provision in Irish law is under sections 113 and 113A of the Succession Act 1965 (as amended) where a spouse or a civil partner can renounce his/her legal right share in a pre-nuptial agreement. Although they are not legally binding, there is nothing in Irish law which stops a couple planning to marry from having and signing a pre-nuptial agreement. Importantly, such agreements can serve as guides for the courts in judicial separation and divorce cases. If a pre-nuptial agreement makes \u2018proper provision\u2019 for each person it is more likely to be persuasive on the judge.

However, the specific legal status and enforceability of pre-nuptial agreements can vary significantly depending on local laws and court interpretations. For instance, some states have strict regulations regarding the negotiation process and the need for independent financial advisors, while others allow more flexibility.",

Under this scheme, eligible employees are given a tax-free voucher that can be used towards the cost of purchasing a new bicycle or other cycle-related equipment. The value of the voucher depends on the employee's income level and the type of cycle purchased. For example, someone earning \u00a320,000 per year would receive a higher value than someone earning \u00a315,000 per year.",
