The eligibility requirements change depending on whether someone was born in Ireland, Northern Ireland, or abroad. For instance, those born in Ireland prior to January 1, 2005, or in Northern Ireland after that date, can claim Irish citizenship if one or both of their parents were Irish or British citizens at the time of birth. Alternatively, if a person's grandparent was born in Ireland and their name appears on the Foreign Births Register, they might qualify. Additionally, those born outside of Ireland can obtain citizenship through naturalization if they meet specific residency and character requirements.",

Lack of work: for example, your employer no longer needs or has a reduced need for employees with your skills or new technology has made your job unnecessary.

The only provision in Irish law is under sections 113 and 113A of the Succession Act 1965 (as amended) where a spouse or a civil partner can renounce his/her legal right share in a pre-nuptial agreement. Although they are not legally binding, there is nothing in Irish law which stops a couple planning to marry from having and signing a pre-nuptial agreement.

If a pre-nuptial agreement makes \u2018proper provision\u2019 for each person it is more likely to be persuasive on the judge.

            "question": "What is the legal status of pre-nuptial agreements?",
            "answer": "Pre-nuptial agreements have no basis in law in Ireland. As a result, they are not strictly binding. This means that if you have a pre-nuptial agreement in place and you end up in court following the breakdown of your marriage, the judge is not bound by the terms of the pre-nuptial agreement. However, there is nothing in Irish law which stops a couple planning to marry from having and signing a pre-nuptial agreement.",
