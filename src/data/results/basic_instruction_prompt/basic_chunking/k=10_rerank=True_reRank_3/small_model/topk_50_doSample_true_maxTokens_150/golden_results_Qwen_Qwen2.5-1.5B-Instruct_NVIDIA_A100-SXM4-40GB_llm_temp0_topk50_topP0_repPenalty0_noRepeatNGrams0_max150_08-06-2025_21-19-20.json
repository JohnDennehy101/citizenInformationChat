            "answer": "Irish citizenship has two main routes of acquisition:\n\n- Naturalization: This route involves acquiring Irish nationality by fulfilling certain criteria set out in the Constitution and under the Citizenship Act 2009. These criteria typically require holding another country's citizenship for at least one year before applying for naturalization.\n\n- Birth within Ireland: The second route is through birth within the Republic of Ireland. Children born on or after January 1, 1995, are automatically granted Irish citizenship if their parents hold Irish citizenship (or a qualifying foreign passport).\n\nFor both routes, there are additional requirements such as passing an English language test, being of good character, and meeting other eligibility criteria that vary depending on the specific pathway chosen.",

It's not necessarily tied to citizenship or legal residency status; it could be someone who has been living in a foreign country for many years without formal immigration documents. The concept helps in determining tax obligations, inheritance rights, and other personal matters related to domicile. \n\nFor example, if you have been living in a particular city for 20 years and consider that place your permanent home, then that city would be considered your ordinary residence regardless of whether you're legally allowed to live there or not. This distinction can affect how long you can stay abroad before needing to return to pay taxes on income earned abroad, among other things.",

A genuine redundancy is one where your employer has a real business reason to make you redundant. Reasons for redundancy include: Financial difficulties within the business: for example, your employer needs to cut costs and this means staff numbers must be reduced. Lack of work: for example, your employer no longer needs or has a reduced need for employees with your skills or new technology has made your job unnecessary. Reorganisation within the business: for example, your employer has decided to carry on the business with fewer or no staff or the job you do no longer exists. Business closure: the business is closing down or moving.",
            "question": "What counts as genuine redundancy?",
            "answer": "Genuine redundancy is when an employee's position is eliminated because they are no longer needed for business reasons. This can be due to factors such as downsizing, restructuring, or changes in market demand. To determine if someone qualifies as redundant, employers typically consider whether the individual meets certain criteria, including their job requirements and relevance to ongoing operations. In some cases, employees who have been laid off might also qualify as redundant if they were not expected to continue working in their current roles due to organizational changes or strategic decisions. It's important to note that while genuine redundancy involves job loss, it does not necessarily mean that all associated benefits will be terminated; severance packages, health insurance, and other perks may still apply depending on company policies and legal obligations.",

It serves as a form of identification and allows patients to easily access healthcare services at various locations within the same practice.

They often contain basic personal information such as the patient's name, address, and contact details, making them convenient tools for managing healthcare needs efficiently within the GP's practice network. While they do not replace traditional forms of identification like driver\u2019s licenses or passports, GP visit cards offer a streamlined approach to patient management that integrates seamlessly into the daily operations of primary care practices.",

It can also be used to renovate vacant and derelict properties that have not been used as residential properties before. However, this only applies if the non-residential properties were used for commercial or public use before and now have the correct planning permission. You can get the grant if you are refurbishing the vacant property so you can live there, or so you can rent the property out. You can get a grant of up to \u20ac50,000 to renovate a vacant property and up to \u20ac70,000, if the property is derelict. You can get more if you are living on an off-shore island. And, there is an additional grant for expert conservation advice if you are refurbishing a vacant traditional farmhouse. The Vacant Property Refurbishment Grant is funded by the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage through the Cro\u00ed C\u00f3naithe (Towns) Fund and you apply to your local authority.

            "question": "What is the Vacant Property Refurbishment Grant?",
            "answer": "The Vacant Property Refurbishment Grant (VPRG) is a UK government grant designed to help property owners improve and refurbish their empty properties for sale or rent. It's aimed at businesses looking to turn over vacant properties into productive assets by providing financial support through grants of up to \u00a350,000 per project. This initiative supports both new-build and existing buildings, making it accessible to various types of properties including homes, offices, and commercial spaces. The aim is to stimulate local economies by encouraging the conversion of unused properties into economically viable facilities, thereby creating jobs and increasing tax revenues for local authorities. The VPRG has been instrumental in driving regeneration projects across the country, particularly in areas experiencing economic downturns.",

This means that if you have a pre-nuptial agreement in place and you end up in court following the breakdown of your marriage, the judge is not bound by the terms of the pre-nuptial agreement. The only provision in Irish law is under sections 113 and 113A of the Succession Act 1965 (as amended) where a spouse or a civil partner can renounce his/her legal right share in a pre-nuptial agreement. Although they are not legally binding, there is nothing in Irish law which stops a couple planning to marry from having and signing a pre-nuptial agreement. Importantly, such agreements can serve as guides for the courts in judicial separation and divorce cases. If a pre-nuptial agreement makes \u2018proper provision\u2019 for each person it is more likely to be persuasive on the judge. Therefore, in situations where one party is likely to inherit a significant family farm or business, it will guide the judge in the divorce or judicial separation on what the parties\u2019 intentions were at the outset.",

In the United States, many states now recognize them as legally binding contracts between spouses before marriage. However, not all states explicitly allow for pre-nups, and some courts still consider them unenforceable if they are entered into under duress or undue influence.\n\nThe recognition and enforceability of pre-nuptial agreements vary widely by state, reflecting different approaches to balancing individual rights with public policy concerns such as financial stability during marriage and protection from creditors. Some jurisdictions require that both parties voluntarily enter into the agreement without coercion; others impose stricter conditions on its validity.",

If you are self-employed, you cannot take part in the Cycle to Work Scheme unless you pay PRSI as an employee in addition to your self-employed work.",
            "question": "What is the Cycle to Work Scheme?",
            "answer": "The Cycle to Work Scheme (CTWS) is a government-funded scheme that allows employees to purchase cycle-related equipment from participating employers at their full retail price and then claim tax relief on the cost of the item. This means that employees do not have to pay income tax on the value of the bike they buy through this scheme, provided it meets certain criteria such as being used for commuting purposes. The scheme aims to encourage people to use bicycles as a form of transportation instead of cars, which can help reduce traffic congestion and improve air quality. It was introduced by the UK government in 2001 and has been expanded over time to cover more items like safety gear, lights, and accessories.",
