Additionally, those born outside of Ireland may qualify through foreign birth registries or by becoming Irish citizens through naturalization. Document 1:::\n\n**Ireland's Citizenship Eligibility Criteria**\n\nTo acquire Irish citizenship, individuals need to satisfy specific conditions depending on their background and circumstances. Here\u2019s a breakdown of how different scenarios lead to Irish citizenship:\n\n1. **Born in Ireland/Northern Ireland before 1 Jan 2005**: Automatically eligible upon birth due to being born in the country.\n   \n2. **Born in Ireland/Northern Ireland after 31 Dec 2004**: Can apply for citizenship if one of two conditions is met:\n   - Either one or both parents are Irish or British citizens.\n   - One or both parents were Irish or British citizens at the time of the applicant's birth, and at least three out of four consecutive years prior to birth were spent in Ireland.\n\n3. **Born abroad**: \n   - One or both parents were born in Ireland and were Irish citizens.\n   - Your grandparent was born in Ireland and your birth was registered on the Foreign Births Register.\n   - One or both parents became Irish citizens through registration or naturalization within 4 years before the applicant's birth.\n\n4. **Not entitled to citizenship by birth/descendence**: Individuals who fall into these categories can still apply for citizenship by naturalization.

However, both options require payment via credit or debit card and involve sending original documents to the Passport Service upon completion of the application. Fees for passports are also charged, although the specific amount depends on the individual circumstances. The length of time it takes for an application to be processed varies based on the type of application and the country where the passport is being applied for, with online applications generally taking around 7-10 working days to complete the entire process. Additionally, individuals living abroad may need to seek permission from a registrar and complete additional steps such as attending an interview with the registrar and providing certain documentation. The best course of action would be to visit the official website of the Passport Service for detailed information about the process and specific requirements for each option.",

In most jobs, employees usually tell their direct manager about absences.\n\nOr, your employer may assign a specific or designated person to handle matters related to domestic violence leave and other available support. The designated person could be a HR manager or the business owner.\n\nYour employer should make sure the designated person is well-trained to handle employee disclosures properly.\n\nCan my employer ask for proof?\n\nYou are not required to give your employer any supporting information or evidence when requesting domestic violence leave.\n\nThere might be exceptional situations where your employer could ask for supporting documents, but this would be rare and is not in line with the intentions of the law.\n\nConfidentiality\n\nYour employer should treat any information you disclose about domestic violence with the utmost sensitivity and confidentiality.\n\nThey should only share the information with those who need it for safety plans or administering domestic violence leave. Ideally, your employer should get your written permission before sharing any information.\n\nSharing information does not always mean breaking confidentiality. Your employer can find ways to share details without revealing your identity or the fact that you disclosed domestic violence.\n\nYour employment rights\n\nIn general, you will be treated as if you are in work during domestic violence leave.\n\nThis means:\n\nYour time on domestic violence leave does not break your continuous service. It also counts as service when calculating entitlements such as annual leave and public holidays.\n\nYou must not be dismissed for taking or asking to take domestic violence leave.Document 2:::\nEnglish | Gaeilge\n\nYou are here: Home > Employment > Employment rights and conditions > Leave and holidays > Other types of leave from work\n\nOther types of leave from work\n\nTaking time off work\n\nForce majeure leave\n\nLeave for medical care\n\nCompassionate leave\n\nJury service\n\nCareer break or study leave\n\nHow to make a complaint\n\nMore information\n\nTaking time off work\n\nThere are different reasons you might need time off work, for example:\n\nIf you have a family crisis, like a sudden illness in your family\n\nIf you are called for jury service\n\nIf you want to take study leave or a career break\n\nIn some cases, you are entitled to be paid for your leave, but in others you are not.\n\nYou may also want to read about types of statutory leave from work, including:\n\nAnnual leave\n\nPublic holidays\n\nSick leave\n\nMaternity leave\n\nPaternity leave\n\nAdoptive leave\n\nCarer\u2019s leave\n\nParental leave\n\nParent's leave\n\nLeave for medical care\n\nDomestic violence leave\n\nForce majeure leave\n\nIf you have a family crisis, you have a right to limited time off work. This is called force majeure leave .\n\nYou may need to take force majeure leave for an urgent family reason, such as the unexpected injury or illness of a \u2018close family member\u2019.\n\nA close family member includes:\n\nYour child (including an adopted child)\n\nYour spouse or partner\n\nYour parent or grandparent\n\nYour sibling\n\nSomeone who you have a duty of care for (for example, you are acting in place of a parent, also known as loco parentis )\n\nSomeone who depends on you for care (known as \u2018domestic dependency\u2019)\n\nOther people as defined by law\n\nIf a close family member has died, you do not have an entitlement to force majeure leave.

However, your employer can decide whether to grant your request or refuse it. \n\nThe decision regarding when annual leave may be taken is subject to certain conditions set forth by the employer. These conditions often consider factors such as your family responsibilities and the availability of rest and recreation options. Additionally, discussing your annual leave needs with either yourself or your union at least one month prior to the intended date of absence is typically required.\n\nEmployers must also ensure that they comply with regulations designed to protect employees' rights under the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997. According to these laws, employers should provide reasonable accommodations for employees with family responsibilities while ensuring the overall health and wellbeing of the workforce.\n\nIt's important to note that employees have the right to request annual leave, even though it's not mandatory for them to do so. They can choose to take annual leave at specific times or wait until the appropriate timeframe based on their personal circumstances. Employers can still refuse such requests under certain conditions outlined by the law. Document 3:::\nNo, you cannot use this method if you changed employment during the leave year. You should instead use Method 2, which calculates 1/3 of a working week for each calendar month in which you worked at least 117 hours.\n\nCalculating holiday entitlement involves several steps, including determining the number of working weeks and hours you've worked throughout the leave year. For Method 2, you'll divide the total number of hours you worked by 30 to determine the equivalent working weeks, then multiply by the number of working weeks you met the minimum hour requirement.\n\nAlternatively, if you're employed through an agency, the party paying your wages (the employment agency or client company) becomes the employer for the purposes of calculating your holiday entitlement. Under Method 3, you'll calculate 8% of your hours worked in the leave year, capped at four working weeks.\n\nTo clarify, your employer should include all hours you worked, including time spent on annual leave, maternity leave, parental leave, force majeure leave, adoptive leave, or the first 13 weeks of carer's leave. This comprehensive approach ensures that no part of your labor contribution is overlooked when computing your entitlement.\n\nRegarding holiday pay, it must be paid out in advance according to your usual weekly rate. If your pay varies from week to week due to bonuses or commissions, the holiday pay will be determined by averaging your earnings over the preceding 13 weeks. This method aims to provide consistency in payment terms, reflecting the actual economic situation of the employee rather than assuming fixed rates every week.\n\nFinally, for part-time workers, the calculation follows Method 3, where you'll derive 8% of your hours worked. Part-time arrangements require careful consideration of how to allocate these percentages across multiple employment contracts or projects, ensuring fairness and accuracy in the distribution of benefits and compensations. Document 4:::\nAn employer cannot compel an employee to take annual leave unless there are compelling legal grounds justifying such action. Employees generally have the autonomy to decide when and if they wish to take annual leave, although there are instances where exceptions may occur. \n\nFor instance, under the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997, employees have the option to decline annual leave, allowing them to manage their own schedules and commitments outside of work. Moreover, employees can opt-out of taking annual leave entirely, thereby preserving their flexibility and control over their professional lives.\n\nIn practice, employers sometimes offer alternative arrangements, such as flexible working hours, job-sharing, or phased leave policies, to accommodate employees' personal needs and preferences without forcing them to take annual leave. Such measures aim to foster a work-life balance and promote employee satisfaction and engagement.\n\nHowever, there are scenarios where employers might exercise influence over employees' annual leave decisions. For example, if an employee fails to meet performance targets or violates company policies, disciplinary actions may indirectly affect their annual leave allocation. Nevertheless, these interventions remain discretionary and aimed at maintaining productivity and organizational efficiency.\n\nIn summary, employees retain significant control over their annual leave arrangements. While employers have the authority to mandate annual leave, doing so requires strong justification grounded in legal principles and practical considerations. Employers must respect employees' choices and strive to create a supportive environment that accommodates diverse work-life priorities.\nSure! Here are five key points based on the provided context:\n\n1. **Employer Authority**: Employers generally have the discretion to mandate annual leave, but this is contingent upon valid legal grounds.\n   \n2. **Employee Autonomy**: Employees have the freedom to decide when to take annual leave, although this is subject to constraints like meeting performance criteria.\n\n3. **Flexible Work Policies**: Many employers implement flexible working policies to allow employees to manage their personal life alongside work obligations.\n\n4. **Exceptional Circumstances**: Disciplinary actions against employees may indirectly impact their annual leave allocations",

Your employer cannot insist you take annual leave on days you are off sick and have a medical certificate. \n\nThis sentence indicates that sick leave during annual leave would not be considered as annual leave, and thus, no payment or vacation days would be deducted from the annual leave balance. It emphasizes the importance of having proper documentation of sickness for such situations to avoid confusion or misinterpretation regarding the nature of the absence. The sentence also implies that annual leave can still be accrued during sick leave periods provided the individual remains fit enough to return to work after recovery. \n\nIt's crucial to maintain accurate records and ensure that sick certificates are properly filed to prevent any discrepancies in calculating annual leave balances. Documenting sickness accurately helps in avoiding misunderstandings between employers and employees regarding the treatment of sick leave durations. Additionally, keeping track of sick leave days allows individuals to plan their annual leave schedule accordingly, ensuring they accumulate sufficient days to cover their personal needs without compromising their eligibility for annual leave. Overall, maintaining clear and consistent communication around sick leave policies ensures fairness and transparency throughout the annual leave process. Question: Can I share my unpaid parental leave with my partner? Helpful Answer:\nYes, both parents have an equal, separate entitlement to parental leave. This means you are both entitled to 26 weeks leave. If you both work for the same employer and your employer agrees, you can transfer 14 weeks of your parental leave entitlement to the other parent. This arrangement ensures shared responsibilities and flexibility in utilizing parental leave resources. However, it's important to discuss and agree upon the terms of sharing leave to avoid potential conflicts or disputes. Both partners should understand their roles and responsibilities during the leave period to facilitate smoother transitions and better support for the child. Sharing parental leave requires open communication and mutual consent to ensure equitable distribution of responsibilities and benefits. Question: How to make a complaint to the WRC?\nHelpful Answer:\nTo make a complaint to the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC), follow these steps:\n1. Use the online complaint form available through the website.\n2. Submit your complaint within 6 months of the dispute arising.\n3. If necessary, extend the time limit for a further 6 months due to reasonable circumstances.\n4. Ensure all required information and evidence are included in your submission.\n5. Keep copies of all correspondence and documents related to the complaint for your records.\nBy adhering to these guidelines, you increase the likelihood of resolving your issues formally and efficiently with the WRC. Remember, timely filing and thorough documentation are key components in pursuing fair resolutions through the WRC system. Question: What happens if I take sick leave while on probation?\nHelpful Answer:\nDuring your probationary period, your employer can suspend your probation, training, or apprenticeship for the duration of your sick leave. However, once you recover, your status as an apprentice or trainee will resume. It's essential to communicate openly with your employer about your condition and recovery progress to avoid delays or complications in your professional development timeline. Maintaining regular contact and updating your employer on your health status demonstrates accountability and respect for your employer's expectations. Question: What happens to my social insurance contributions while I'm on parental leave?\nHelpful Answer:\nYou can receive credited PRSI contributions while on parental leave. These contributions can protect your social insurance record and future entitlements. To secure these credits, your employer must submit a statement detailing the weeks of unpaid work to the Client Eligibility Services section of the Department of Social Protection (DSP). This step is crucial for maintaining your eligibility for future benefits, especially considering the impact of parental leave on your financial stability. By providing this information promptly, you ensure continuity in your social security coverage and preparedness for post-parental leave arrangements. Question: Is my employer allowed to terminate me while on long-term sick leave?\nHelpful Answer:\nYour employer cannot dismiss you while on long-term sick leave unless you are deemed unfit for work due to the illness. The decision to terminate your employment typically hinges on whether you meet the criteria for being permanently disabled or suffering from a serious illness. Therefore, employers are generally restricted from terminating workers on long-term sick leave until they demonstrate that continued employment is no longer feasible. Ensuring that your medical documentation supports your inability to perform specific tasks or duties prevents unjust terminations. Promptly seeking medical advice and obtaining appropriate certifications helps mitigate risks associated with premature dismissal claims. Question: Can I share my sick leave with my partner?\nHelpful Answer:\nNo, sick leave is typically allocated individually per employee, regardless of marital status. Each employee maintains their own sick leave entitlements independently, which can vary based on company policy. While some companies might offer flexible arrangements where partners can share sick leave, it's advisable to check your employer's specific policy to confirm. This practice aims to distribute workload evenly among employees rather than creating a dependency",

DO NOT copy entire sections, lists, or extracted content. Instead, extract only the relevant poionts to answer the question effectively.\n4.

DO NOT include extracted documents section.\n\n\nExtracted documents:\nDocument 0:::\nRead more about leases on the website of Threshold, the national housing charity.\n\nPeriodic tenancy\n\nA periodic tenancy agreement does not specify a fixed length of time. The period of the tenancy may be weekly or monthly, depending on how often the rent is due. Periodic tenancy agreements may or may not be in writing.\n\nYour landlord can end the tenancy at any time during the first 6 months of the tenancy without having to give a reason, but, in general, you will get security of tenure after 6 months \u2013 see \u2018Part 4 tenancy\u2019 below. You must always get a valid written notice of termination and there are rules about how much notice you must be given, depending on the length of the tenancy (with some exceptions). Read more in our page If your landlord wants you to leave .\n\nAs a tenant, you can end the periodic tenancy at any time. You do not have to give a reason. Again, there are rules about notice periods and what constitutes a valid notice of termination \u2013 see \u2018Ending your tenancy\u2019 below.\n\nClaiming a Part 4 tenancy at the end of a fixed-term lease\n\nIf you have a fixed-term contract or lease and you want to remain in the property under a Part 4 tenancy, you should notify your landlord of your intention to stay in the property. You should do this between 3 months and 1 month before your fixed\u2013term tenancy or lease agreement expires.\n\nIf you do not notify your landlord, you cannot be refused coverage under Part 4, but you may have to compensate the landlord for any financial loss that they have because you did not notify them of your intention to remain in the tenancy.\n\nEnding your tenancy\n\nThe following section outlines what a tenant must do to end a tenancy. There are different rules for landlords who want to end a tenancy . The RTB also has information on their website about how a tenant can end a tenancy .\n\nFormat of termination notice\n\nAs a tenant, you can terminate your tenancy (whether fixed-term or periodic) without giving a reason, but you must give a valid notice of termination to your landlord. In order to be valid, this notice must:\n\nBe in writing\n\nBe signed by you\n\nSpecify the date that you are serving it on the landlord\n\nSpecify the termination date of the tenancy (you have the full 24 hours of this date to vacate possession)Document 1:::\nYou do not have security of tenure . This came in under the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2019 (pdf) .\n\nYou cannot be forced to pay for student-specific accommodation during the summer when you don\u2019t need it. Your tenancy or licence arrangement should not be more than 41 weeks, unless you ask for longer. If your landlord does not comply with the 41-week rule you should contact to the RTB, who can sanction your landlord. This rule came in under the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2024 and applies to tenancies and licence arrangements in student-specific accommodation created from 20 July 2024.\n\nYou only need to give your landlord 28 days\u2019 notice when ending a tenancy. You can give your landlord more notice if you want and your landlord must give you more. This came in under the Residential Tenancies (No. 2) Act 2021 .\n\nYou can terminate your fixed-term tenancy any time between 1 May and 1 October each year for any reason. But, outside of these dates, the existing rules about ending a fixed-term tenancy apply and you can only terminate your tenancy for specific reasons. This rule came in under the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2024 .\n\nFind out more about your rights as a tenant in student-specific accommodation on the RTB\u2019s website .\n\nSecurity of tenure\n\nSecurity of tenure is a tenant\u2019s right to stay in rented accommodation for a set amount of time. Generally, security of tenure applies automatically when you have been renting for 6 months and haven\u2019t received a valid notice of termination from your landlord in that time. When you have security of tenure, your landlord can only terminate your tenancy for a limited number of reasons, see our page \u2018 If your landlord wants you to leave \u2019.\n\nThe amount of time you are entitled to stay in rented accommodation after the first 6 months depends on when your tenancy began.\n\nIf your tenancy was created after 10 June 2022 , you have a tenancy of unlimited duration. This means if you have rented somewhere for 6 months, you have the right to stay in that accommodation indefinitely (no end date), unless the landlord wants to terminate your tenancy for one of the allowed reasons.Document 2:::\nIf this is not done, the notice of termination is invalid. The RTB recommends that landlords use certified post when posting the notice of termination to the tenant and the RTB, and that they keep proof of this.\n\nWhen the RTB receives the notice of termination it will:\n\nWrite to you and your landlord about the RTB services and outline your rights and responsibilities under residential tenancies legislation\n\nAsk for your contact details in case the landlord needs them to offer the property back to you. This will only be done with your consent\n\nThis requirement is in place since 6 July 2022, when it was brought in under the Regulation of Providers of Building Works and Miscellaneous Provisions Act 2022.\n\nThe RTB's website has more information about these changes .\n\nWhat is a valid notice of termination?\n\nThe law sets out the requirements for a valid notice of termination. It must:\n\nBe in writing (an email is not sufficient)\n\nBe signed by the landlord (or an authorised agent)\n\nSpecify the date of termination of the tenancy\n\nState that you have the whole 24 hours of the termination date to vacate the property\n\nSpecify the date of the notice itself\n\nState the reason for termination, if a tenancy has lasted more than 6 months or is a fixed-term tenancy. (This does not have to be included for tenancies in student-specific accommodation.)\n\nState that any issue about the validity of the notice or the right of the landlord to serve it must be referred to the RTB within 90 days from the receipt of the notice. (This 90-day timeframe applies unless the tenant is in breach of their obligations.)\n\nYour landlord must give additional details in certain situations and, in some cases, a statutory declaration. The information below describes the additional details needed for each of the valid reasons for terminating your tenancy. The RTB also provides sample notices of termination , with the details required in each situation.\n\nIf the property is being sold\n\nIf your landlord intends to sell the property within 9 months of the terminating your tenancy, the notice of termination must state that:\n\n\u201cThe reason for the termination of the tenancy is due to the fact that the landlord intends to sell the dwelling, for full consideration, within 9 months after the termination of the tenancy\u201d.\n\nQuestion: What is a valid reason for ending a tenancy after the first 6 months?\n\nHelpful Answer:\nA valid reason for ending a tenancy after the first 6 months would typically involve a significant change in circumstances affecting the tenant, such as moving away permanently, becoming disabled, or experiencing a personal crisis that makes continued living difficult. However, the exact criteria can vary based on local laws, so tenants should refer to the specific regulations applicable to their area for guidance. Additionally, if the landlord wishes to evict the tenant for non-payment of rent, the eviction process must follow legal procedures outlined by the local government authority. Document 3:::\nThere are no fees charged for issuing a notice of termination; however, there are costs associated with seeking assistance from the RTB if the notice is challenged. These costs include:\n\n- A fee of \u00a370 for filing a claim against a landlord\n- Up to \u00a3250 for expert witness fees (if necessary)\n- Up to \u00a3150 for court fees\n\nThese costs can add up quickly, especially if multiple claims are made against a single landlord. Therefore, it is important for tenants to seek advice from the RTB or a solicitor before taking action to avoid unexpected expenses.\n\nSummary of key points:\n\n- Security of tenure ensures that tenants have indefinite rights to occupy rented properties for six months without needing a notice of termination.\n- Tenants can choose to terminate a tenancy at any time without providing a reason, but must provide a valid notice of termination specifying the termination date and stating the cause of termination.\n- Tenants must give a minimum of 28 days' notice to end a tenancy, except for fixed-term tenancies which allow for shorter notice periods.\n- Tenants can request longer tenancies under certain conditions, particularly those involving students staying beyond the standard term limit.\n- The Residential Tenancies Board (RTB) plays a crucial role in enforcing the law, including verifying the validity of termination notices and ensuring compliance with other tenant rights. The RTB also offers support and advice to tenants facing issues related to their tenancies. - For more detailed information, visit the RTB's website or consult with a professional lawyer.\n\nFinal answer:\nTenants can terminate their tenancy without giving a reason if they choose to do so, provided they give a valid notice of termination. This notice must meet specific requirements, including being in writing, signed by the tenant, and specifying both the termination date and the reason for termination. Tenants have a choice regarding whether to terminate their tenancy early, but they must still abide by the terms of the original agreement, including paying any outstanding rent. The RTB plays a vital role in monitoring compliance with these rules and ensuring fair treatment of tenants. - For further information, please refer to the Residential Tenancies Board's guidelines or seek professional legal advice. I hope this summary helps clarify the key aspects of ending a tenancy and the corresponding rights and responsibilities for tenants. Remember to review the latest regulations periodically, as they might change over time. Let me know if you need help accessing the RTB's resources or finding more information! Good luck with your tenancy journey. Document 4:::\nLeases are contracts between a landlord and a tenant that establish the terms of the rental relationship. They can last for varying lengths of time, from short-term tenancies lasting just a few months to long-term tenancies covering several years or even decades. Landlords and tenants can agree on various lease terms, including the length of the tenancy, the rent payments, and any special provisions like utilities paid directly by the tenant or pets allowed. \n\nIn many jurisdictions, leases come with restrictions and conditions designed to protect both parties. These could include limits on the number of occupants, maintenance obligations, and prohibitions on letting the property for another purpose. Some leases may require payment in advance of the next rent period, while others allow for flexible payment schedules.\n\nIt's worth noting that leases are subject to local laws and regulations. In some areas, landlords may not be able to enter a tenant's home without permission, while others may permit more frequent inspections or access checks. Similarly, tenants may be obligated to maintain the property according to specified standards or face penalties for failing to do so.\n\nFor example, in London, England, a typical tenancy agreement may stipulate that the landlord must provide gas meters and a meter reading service every three months. This is part of the broader regulation governing domestic tenancies in the city.\n\nTo ensure clarity and prevent misunderstandings, it's advisable for both parties to read and understand all clauses of the lease document thoroughly. This includes familiarizing oneself with any limitations or restrictions placed upon either party, as well as understanding the consequences of breaching these terms.\n\nIn conclusion, leases play a critical role in establishing the framework for a rental relationship between landlords and tenants. By setting clear expectations and defining responsibilities, leases help manage potential disputes and ensure a stable environment for everyone involved.

There are different types of domestic adoption, for example, step-parent adoption and long-term foster care adoption .\n\nThis page explains the different types of domestic adoption, the steps involved in the adoption process, and the rules about who can adopt a child in Ireland.\n\nYou may also want to read our page about intercountry adoption , which is where you adopt a child from abroad.\n\nTypes of domestic adoption\n\nDomestic adoption is when you adopt a child who is resident in Ireland. There are different types of domestic adoption:\n\nStep-parent adoption\n\nStep-parent adoption is where you apply to adopt your partner\u2019s child.\n\nYour partner can consent (agree) to the adoption and still keep their own parental rights and responsibilities. In a step-parent adoption, you and your partner share parenting duties once the adoption order is made. Read about adoption orders in the section \u2018Steps involved in adopting a child\u2019, below.\n\nThe child must have lived with their parent and you (the prospective step- parent) together, for a minimum of 2 years .\n\nExtended family adoption\n\nAn extended family adoption is where a member of the child\u2019s family (or a relative), adopts the child. The child would have been placed with them by the birth mother or by the Tusla childcare system.\n\nDomestic infant adoption\n\nDomestic infant adoption is where a child is placed with an alternative set of parents. The child is placed with the couple by the Tusla adoption service or an accredited adoption agency. The Adoption Authority of Ireland must approve the placement before it takes place.\n\nLong term foster care adoption\n\nFoster care adoption is when a couple adopt a child who was originally placed with them in a foster care situation.\n\nFind more information on the different types of domestic adoption on the Adoption Authority of Ireland\u2019s website.\n\nWho can adopt a child in Ireland?Document 1:::\nEnglish | Gaeilge\n\nYou are here: Home > Family and Relationships > Adoption, fostering and surrogacy > Intercountry adoption\n\nIntercountry adoption\n\nWhat is intercountry adoption?\n\nWho can adopt?\n\nBeing assessed for eligibility to adopt\n\nChoosing a country to adopt from\n\nThe process of intercountry adoption\n\nGetting immigration clearance for the child\n\nSteps to take once the child arrives in Ireland\n\nMore information about intercountry adoption\n\nWhat is intercountry adoption?\n\nIf you adopt a child who lives in a country outside Ireland, the process is called intercountry adoption. If you adopt a child who is resident in Ireland, it is called domestic adoption .\n\nWhen you adopt a child, they become a member of your family. Adoption creates a legal relationship between the adoptive parents and the child.\n\nAs intercountry adoption is a complex legal process, you should get legal advice from a solicitor who specialises in intercountry adoption. See 'More information about intercountry adoption' below.\n\nWho can adopt?\n\nYou must be at least 21 years of age to adopt a child under Irish law. There is no Irish legal upper age limit for adopting parents but age is a factor in determining suitability here.\n\nYou must also:\n\nHave a valid 'declaration of eligibility and suitability' (see 'Being assessed for eligibility to adopt' below)\n\nBe \u2018habitually resident in the State\u2019, which means Ireland has become your home. Living in Ireland for at least one year before the date of the making of the adoption order would generally be sufficient.\n\nYour relationship status does not necessarily impact your eligibility to adopt a child. This means you are eligible to adopt if you are:\n\nA married couple\n\nA couple living together in a civil partnership\n\nA couple cohabiting together in a relationship for at least 3 years (living together but not married or in a civil partnership)\n\nA sole applicant who is not in one of the categories listed above (only where the Adoption Authority is satisfied that, in the particular circumstances of the case, it is desirable and in the best interests of the child)\n\nYou may also be eligible to adopt if you are the mother, father or relative of the child. \u2018Relative\u2019 means a grandparent, brother, sister, uncle or aunt of the child (or the spouse of any such person), with the relationship to the child being traced through either the mother or the father.Document 2:::\nTo request an Immigration Clearance Letter, you need to write to:\n\nForeign Adoptions Unit\n\nUnit 3 Domestic Residence & Permissions Division\n\n4th floor\n\nImmigration Service Delivery\n\nDepartment of Justice\n\n13-14 Burgh Quay\n\nDublin 2\n\nD02 XK70\n\nYou must include:\n\nA letter of application, with a daytime contact number\n\nA photocopy of the passport of each adopter\n\nTwo passport size photographs of each adopter\n\nThe original Declaration of Eligibility and Suitability (not a copy)\n\nA letter from the Adoption Authority stating how many children you are eligible to adopt and from what country\n\nThese documents will be returned to you with your Immigration Clearance Letter, when approved. You will need to show this letter to an immigration officer when you return to Ireland.\n\nSteps to take once the child arrives in Ireland\n\nTell the Adoption Authority that the child has arrived\n\nYou must tell the Adoption Authority of Ireland and Tusla when you bring the child to Ireland for the first time after adoption in the country of origin. Find contact details in the section \u2018More information about intercountry adoption\u2019 below.\n\nYou must also tell the Adoption Authority and Tusla if you have brought the child to Ireland, in order to adopt the child through domestic adoption .\n\nYou must do this within 3 months of the child arriving in Ireland.\n\nRegister the adoption in Ireland\n\nIf the child was adopted in the country of origin, the final step in the intercountry adoption process is the registration of the adoption. This is the formal, legal recognition of the adoption by the Irish State.\n\nYou must complete and submit an application for registration of the adoption (pdf) to the Adoption Authority within 3 months of re-entering Ireland following the adoption.\n\nThe Adoption Authority can register the adoption in the \u2018Register of Intercountry Adoptions\u2019, on the basis of an \u2018Article 23 certificate\u2019. An Article 23 certificate is a certificate of assurance from the child\u2019s country of origin that proves the adoption was carried out in compliance with the Hague Convention.\n\nGetting an adoption certificate\n\nWhen the adoption has been registered, it will appear on the Register of Intercountry Adoptions. The register has details of the adopted child and the adoptive parents. It is a public register and is open to scrutiny by members of the public.\n\nQuestion: Who can adopt a child in Ireland?\n\nHelpful Answer:\nTo adopt a child in Ireland, you must be at least 21 years old and meet certain requirements including having a declaration of eligibility and suitability, being habitually resident in the state, and possibly being related to the child. Age is considered a factor in determining suitability. Additionally, there is no upper age limit for adopting parents, but the Adoption Authority considers age as well. Document 1 provides specific criteria for eligibility, noting that the relationship status does not impact eligibility unless it is specifically stated otherwise. For instance, a married couple, a couple living together in a civil partnership, a couple cohabiting for three years, or a sole applicant without those relationships can all be eligible provided the Adoption Authority finds it appropriate and beneficial for the child's welfare. However, the exact eligibility criteria might vary depending on the specific circumstances of the case. To determine whether you qualify, consulting with a solicitor experienced in intercountry adoption is advisable. Document 2 offers detailed instructions on how to obtain necessary documentation and follow the official procedures for bringing the child to Ireland, registering the adoption, and obtaining the required certificates. While the general eligibility criteria outlined in both documents remain consistent, the specific requirements and processes can differ based on individual cases. Therefore, consulting with a specialist lawyer remains crucial for understanding and complying with the legal guidelines surrounding adoption in Ireland.",

If after this time (56 days) you still have not paid your fine, the offence is referred to the courts. If you are convicted in court of speeding offences and non-payment of fines, you will automatically receive 5 penalty points and a fine up to a maximum of \u20ac1,000.\n\nSeatbelt offences : If you drive without a seatbelt or allow children under 17 years to travel in your car without a seatbelt, you will incur a fixed charge fine of \u20ac120. You must pay this fine within 28 days or face an increased fine of \u20ac180 payable within 56 days of the offence. 3 penalty points will be added to your licence if you pay the fine on time.

Additionally, some specific categories of employees such as apprentices, agency workers, and those working on fixed-term contracts may also be eligible for redundancy pay. Document 3:::\nEnglish | Gaeilge\n\nRedundancy pay is paid to people who lose their jobs through no fault of their own. It is meant to compensate them for loss of earnings while they look for a new job. In Ireland, employers are required to provide redundancy pay to employees whose services are terminated for reasons other than misconduct. However, there are exceptions to this rule. For example, employees who are laid off temporarily due to illness or injury are generally not entitled to redundancy pay. Similarly, if an employer closes down permanently or reduces staffing significantly, employees usually do not receive redundancy pay either. Employees who voluntarily leave their jobs without cause are not typically eligible for redundancy pay unless they have signed a contract stating otherwise. In addition, agency workers, apprentices, and employees on fixed-term contracts may also be eligible for redundancy pay depending on the circumstances. Overall, redundancy pay serves as a form of protection against unjustified termination of employment. It provides financial assistance to individuals who have lost their jobs due to factors beyond their control, helping them transition into new employment opportunities. Question: What is statutory redundancy pay? Helpful Answer:\nStatutory redundancy pay is a legal entitlement provided to employees who lose their jobs due to reasons other than misconduct. Under Irish law, this payment is intended to compensate employees for the loss of income resulting from their employment ending unexpectedly. Statutory redundancy pay is determined based on the employee\u2019s length of service and pay rate, with a cap on the total amount payable. The exact amount depends on various factors, including the number of years worked, the employee\u2019s position, and the current market rates for similar roles. Employers are required to notify employees of their rights regarding statutory redundancy pay and provide a reasonable period to seek alternative employment before terminating their contract. While not all terminations fall under the statutory redundancy provisions, employees who meet the eligibility criteria often benefit from this form of compensation.",

It involves providing temporary care to the person needing assistance while allowing the primary caregiver to relax, usually for a shorter period like an evening or a longer duration such as a holiday. This type of care can be arranged through various means, including family members, organizations, or institutions, depending on the location and specific needs of the individual requiring care. For instance, it could involve overnight stays at residential facilities or participation in summer camps if available under government-funded programs. Additionally, there might be financial support available through grants, such as the Carer's Support Grant (now known as the Respite Care Grant), which helps offset some of the costs associated with respite care.

It involves providing temporary care to the person needing assistance while allowing the primary caregiver to relax, usually for a shorter period like an evening or a longer duration such as a holiday. This type of care can be arranged through various means, including family members, organizations, or institutions, depending on the location and specific needs of the individual requiring care. For instance, it could involve overnight stays at residential facilities or participation in summer camps if available under government-funded programs. Additionally, there might be financial support available through grants, such as the Carer's Support Grant (now known as the Respite Care Grant), which helps offset some of the costs associated with respite care.

As a result, they are not strictly binding. This means that if you have a pre-nuptial agreement in place and you end up in court following the breakdown of your marriage, the judge is not bound by the terms of the pre-nuptial agreement.\n\nThe only provision in Irish law is under sections 113 and 113A of the Succession Act 1965 (as amended) where a spouse or a civil partner can renounce his/her legal right share in a pre-nuptial agreement.\n\nAlthough they are not legally binding, there is nothing in Irish law which stops a couple planning to marry from having and signing a pre-nuptial agreement.

If a pre-nuptial agreement makes \u2018proper provision\u2019 for each person it is more likely to be persuasive on the judge. Therefore, in situations where one party is likely to inherit a significant family farm or business, it will guide the judge in the divorce or judicial separation on what the parties\u2019 intentions were at the outset.\n\nDrafting a pre-nuptial agreement\n\nOnly pre-nuptial agreements entered into following independent legal advice for both parties are likely to be taken into account. The court would have to be satisfied that there had been a complete disclosure of assets before the agreement was signed. It is also advisable for the agreement to provide for reviews:\n\nPeriodically (for example, every five years)\n\nIf children are born\n\nIf there is a major change in circumstances (for example, assets are purchased or sold)\n\nThe agreement should be in writing, be signed by each party and comply with the rules of contract law.\n\nThe future of pre-nuptial agreementsDocument 1:::\nYou must notify the personal representative of the deceased of your application for provision from the deceased\u2019s estate within 6 months of an application for a grant of probate .\n\nIn general, if your cohabiting relationship ended two years or more before your ex-partner died, you cannot apply for provision from the estate unless you were getting regular or periodic payments from the deceased.\n\nWhat is a cohabitation agreement?\n\nIf you live with your partner but you do not intend to marry, you should protect your financial interests by entering into a \u2018 cohabitation agreement \u2019 (also called a cohabitant\u2019s agreement). This is a voluntary, signed agreement, which allows you to specify the day-to-day joint financial arrangements of your relationship, such as:\n\nThe payment of joint debts\n\nThe payment of common household expenses\n\nYou can also specify how you plan to separate your assets, such as shared property, should the relationship come to an end. In the event of a break-up, a cohabitation agreement can make the division of your assets more straightforward.\n\nYour cohabitation agreement may include a provision that the redress scheme does not apply to you (for example, you can both agree not to apply for a maintenance order should your relationship end). This is different from similar agreements by married couples. Agreements between married couples cannot exclude either party\u2019s right to apply to the courts for various orders (for example, a maintenance order).\n\nIs a cohabitation agreement valid in court?\n\nIf you and your partner make a cohabitation agreement (an agreement on joint financial matters), it is only valid if:\n\nEach of you has had independent legal advice, or you got legal advice together and have waived the right to independent legal advice (see \u2018More information\u2019 below)\n\nThe agreement is a contract\n\nThe agreement has been signed by each of you\n\nIn exceptional circumstances, the court may set aside or vary (change) your cohabitation agreement (for example, if the enforcement of the agreement would cause serious injustice).\n\nIf you and your cohabitant entered into an agreement before the 2010 Act commenced, it is enforceable.\n\nMore information\n\nIf you are concerned about your rights following the breakdown of your cohabiting relationship, you should get legal advice.Document 2:::\nYour executor must inform your spouse or civil partner in writing of their right to choose between these two options. Your spouse or civil partner must ask for their legal right share within 6 months of being notified, or within 12 months of the taking out of the Grant of Representation.\n\nWhere a legal right share does not apply\n\nYour spouse or civil partner can renounce (give up) their rights to the legal right share. This can be part of an agreement before marriage or civil partnership or the spouse or civil partner can give up their rights to benefit their children or other named beneficiaries.\n\nIf there is evidence of undue influence or evidence that the spouse or civil partner did not understand what they were doing, the renunciation may be challenged. It is normally advised that a spouse or civil partner get independent legal advice if renouncing their legal right share.\n\nThe legal right share can be lost where the spouse or civil partner is:\n\nConvicted of the murder, manslaughter or attempted murder of the deceased person\n\nConvicted of an offence against the deceased person or a child that carries a sentence of more than 2 years\n\nDivorce, separation and desertion\n\nSeparation agreements usually include a renunciation of both spouses\u2019 or civil partner\u2019s legal right share.\n\nIf you are divorced or your civil partnership was dissolved, you do not have to provide a legal right share.\n\nIf your spouse or civil partner deserted you for more than 2 years, they are not entitled to a legal right share unless they deserted you as a result of your behaviour (for example, domestic abuse).\n\nCohabiting partners\n\nPartners, who live with each other but are not married or in a civil partnership, have no automatic legal right to each other's estates, although under the redress scheme for cohabiting couples introduced by the Civil Partnership and Certain Rights and Obligations of Cohabitants Act 2010 a qualified cohabitant can apply for a share of the estate of a deceased cohabitant.\n\nYou can leave some or all of your estate to your partner but this does not cancel out the legal rights of a spouse or civil partner if you were married before to someone else and did not get divorced or had your civil partnership dissolved.\n\nRights of children under a will\n\nChildren do not have any absolute right to inherit any of their parent's estate if the parent has made a will. Children born inside or outside marriage and adopted children all have the same rights and there are no age restrictions.\n\nQuestion: What is the legal status of pre-nuptial agreements?\n\nHelpful Answer:\nPre-nuptial agreements have no legal status in Ireland. They are not strictly binding and thus, judges are not obligated to follow them when deciding on issues related to inheritance after a marriage ends. However, they can still serve as guidelines for the courts during judicial separation and divorce proceedings. Additionally, such agreements can indicate the intentions of the parties at the time of marriage regarding property, maintenance, and custody arrangements.

Question: How do pre-nuptial agreements affect the court decision during divorce or judicial separation? Helpful Answer:\nPre-nuptial agreements can guide the court in divorce or judicial separation cases. If a pre-nuptial agreement makes 'proper provision' for each person, it is more likely to be persuasive on the judge. Therefore, in situations where one party is likely to inherit a significant family farm or business, it will guide the judge in the divorce or judicial separation on what the parties' intentions were at the outset.

Go to the website luas.ie\n2. Click on 'Operating Hours' \n3. View the operating hours for different stops along the Luas lines\n4. Use the 'Frequency' feature to understand how often the Luas runs between stops\n\nBy visiting the provided links and accessing the specific information on the Luas's official website, one can obtain detailed insights into its operational schedules, which include both the times when Luas vehicles are active and the intervals at which they depart. \n\nAdditionally, it's worth noting that while the Luas is generally known for being reliable and punctual, its operating hours and frequencies might occasionally vary depending on factors such as weather conditions, maintenance needs, or special events. Therefore, always verify the current schedule directly from the Luas's official website for the most accurate and up-to-date information. \n\nIt's also beneficial to consider that the Luas operates a range of services including regular tram runs, holiday specials, and additional services during peak periods. Hence, understanding the typical operating hours and frequency helps travelers plan their trips efficiently without missing out on key connections or experiencing delays caused by unexpected changes in service availability. \n\nFor instance, if traveling on the Green Line, the Luas typically operates from early morning until late evening daily, though exact timings can fluctuate based on the day of the week and potential disruptions. Similarly, the Red Line usually starts earlier than the Green Line and finishes later, catering to commuters who live further away. However, these schedules are subject to adjustment according to local regulations and operational requirements. \n\nTherefore, for precise knowledge about Luas operation times and frequency, direct interaction with the Luas's online resources or customer support offers the most comprehensive answers. Additionally, keeping track of any temporary adjustments made to the timetable could prevent missed connections or delayed arrivals, thus enhancing overall trip planning efficiency.
