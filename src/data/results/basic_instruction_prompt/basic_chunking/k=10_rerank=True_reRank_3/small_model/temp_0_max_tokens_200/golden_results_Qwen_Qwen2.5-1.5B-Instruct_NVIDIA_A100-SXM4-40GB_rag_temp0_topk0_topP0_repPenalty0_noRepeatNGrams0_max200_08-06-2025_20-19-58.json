A genuine redundancy is one where your employer has a real business reason to make you redundant. Reasons for redundancy include: Financial difficulties within the business: for example, your employer needs to cut costs and this means staff numbers must be reduced. Lack of work: for example, your employer no longer needs or has a reduced need for employees with your skills or new technology has made your job unnecessary. Reorganisation within the business: for example, your employer has decided to carry on the business with fewer or no staff or the job you do no longer exists.

Your employer must provide evidence of these reasons to justify the dismissal as fair.

Additionally, the document highlights that unless your employer can prove there was a genuine redundancy situation and followed fair procedures, your dismissal may be considered 'unfair'. Document 2 further elaborates on how your employer's selection process for redundancy can be scrutinized based on factors such as adherence to established practices, discrimination, or poor relationships with colleagues.

Penalty points are not added to your licence immediately. Fixed charge and penalty offences Fixed notice penalties are issued for driving offences that attract penalty points and/or just a fine. If you receive a fixed notice penalty, you will be issued a notice by the Department of Transport. If you pay the fixed charge fine within 56 days, you will get a further notice from the Department of Transport confirming that the penalty points will be added to your driving licence. The penalty points will be added to your licence 28 days after that. If you do not pay the fixed charge fine within 56 days, you will get a summons to appear in the District Court. If you are convicted of a driving offence in court, the court will notify the Department of Transport of the number of penalty points attached to that conviction. The Department of Transport will then issue a notification that these penalty points will be added to your driving licence 28 days after the notification date. You can get information on fixed charge notices and fines in our document on driving offences.",

            "ground_truth": "Pre-nuptial agreements have no basis in law in Ireland. As a result, they are not strictly binding. This means that if you have a pre-nuptial agreement in place and you end up in court following the breakdown of your marriage, the judge is not bound by the terms of the pre-nuptial agreement. The only provision in Irish law is under sections 113 and 113A of the Succession Act 1965 (as amended) where a spouse or a civil partner can renounce his/her legal right share in a pre-nuptial agreement. Although they are not legally binding, there is nothing in Irish law which stops a couple planning to marry from having and signing a pre-nuptial agreement. Importantly, such agreements can serve as guides for the courts in judicial separation and divorce cases. If a pre-nuptial agreement makes \u2018proper provision\u2019 for each person it is more likely to be persuasive on the judge. Therefore, in situations where one party is likely to inherit a significant family farm or business, it will guide the judge in the divorce or judicial separation on what the parties\u2019 intentions were at the outset.",

Additionally, the document states that if a pre-nuptial agreement makes 'proper provision,' it is more likely to be considered by the judge. \n\nFurthermore, the text notes that while pre-nuptial agreements are not legally binding, there is nothing in Irish law preventing couples from drafting them. These agreements can help guide the courts in handling divorces and judicial separations.",

You do not have to pay tax, PRSI or the Universal Social Charge on your repayments. Not every employer takes part in the scheme. However, if they do, they must offer it to all their employees.

The employees can then repay this cost from their gross salary. This helps reduce the financial burden on both the employer and the employee by allowing them to benefit from the purchase of a new bike while still contributing towards its cost. Under this scheme, there are specific limits set for each type of bike purchased, such as \u20ac3,000 for cargo and electric cargo bikes, \u20ac1,500 for electric pedal-assist and electrically assisted bikes, and \u20ac1,250 for other types of bikes. Employers who participate in this scheme must offer it to all their employees, though self-employed individuals may be excluded under certain conditions. Additionally, the repayment period varies based on the type of bike; for example, for cargo and electric cargo bikes, the repayment period is typically between one and three years.",
