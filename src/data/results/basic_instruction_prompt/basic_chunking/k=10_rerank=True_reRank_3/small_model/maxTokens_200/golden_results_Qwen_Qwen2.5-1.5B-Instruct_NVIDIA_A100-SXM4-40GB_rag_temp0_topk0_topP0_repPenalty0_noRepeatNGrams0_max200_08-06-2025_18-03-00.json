However, this only applies if the non-residential properties were used for commercial or public use before and now have the correct planning permission. You can get the grant if you are refurbishing the vacant property so you can live there, or so you can rent the property out. You can get a grant of up to \u20ac50,000 to renovate a vacant property and up to \u20ac70,000, if the property is derelict. You can get more if you are living on an off-shore island. And, there is an additional grant for expert conservation advice if you are refurbishing a vacant traditional farmhouse. The Vacant Property Refurbishment Grant is funded by the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage through the Cro\u00ed C\u00f3naithe (Towns) Fund and you apply to your local authority.

            "answer": "Penalty points are recorded on your driving licence when:\n- You are convicted in court of a driving offence that attracts penalty points\n- You pay a fixed charge notice that was issued to you for an offence that also carries penalty points\n\nFor example, if you speed and are fined \u20ac160, you'll receive 3 penalty points. If you're convicted in court, you might receive 5 penalty points and a fine of up to \u20ac5,000.\n\nWhen you reach 12 penalty points, you automatically lose your license for 6 months.\n\nThese points are not visible on the physical licence; they are stored in a record that insurers can access.\n\nPoints are added over time through convictions and fixed charges. They last for 3 years before being removed, unless additional points were accrued while suspended.\n\nTo avoid accumulating too many points, it's important to pay all fines promptly, even those that weren't initially required.",

This means that if you have a pre-nuptial agreement in place and you end up in court following the breakdown of your marriage, the judge is not bound by the terms of the pre-nuptial agreement. The only provision in Irish law is under sections 113 and 113A of the Succession Act 1965 (as amended) where a spouse or a civil partner can renounce his/her legal right share in a pre-nuptial agreement. Although they are not legally binding, there is nothing in Irish law which stops a couple planning to marry from having and signing a pre-nuptial agreement. Importantly, such agreements can serve as guides for the courts in judicial separation and divorce cases. If a pre-nuptial agreement makes \u2018proper provision\u2019 for each person it is more likely to be persuasive on the judge. Therefore, in situations where one party is likely to inherit a significant family farm or business, it will guide the judge in the divorce or judicial separation on what the parties\u2019 intentions were at the outset.",
