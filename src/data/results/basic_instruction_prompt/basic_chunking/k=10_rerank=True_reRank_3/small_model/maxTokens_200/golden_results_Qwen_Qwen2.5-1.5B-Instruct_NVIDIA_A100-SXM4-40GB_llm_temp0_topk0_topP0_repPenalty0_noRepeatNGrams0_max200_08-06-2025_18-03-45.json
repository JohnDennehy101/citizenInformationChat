            "question": "Who is entitled to Irish citizenship?",
            "answer": "Irish citizenship is not inherited by children of parents who are citizens; it must be acquired through birth within Ireland or naturalization. Children born outside Ireland have the option to apply for Irish citizenship if they meet certain conditions such as being resident and married to an Irish citizen for at least 5 years. Naturalized Irish citizens do not automatically pass on their Irish citizenship to their children. The law regarding Irish citizenship has been revised several times since independence, reflecting changes in the political landscape and changing social values. For more detailed information, refer to the latest version of the Citizenship Act, which is updated annually by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. \n\nTo summarize, Irish citizenship is granted primarily through birth within the country or naturalization. However, individuals born abroad can potentially acquire Irish citizenship if they meet specific residency requirements. Naturalized citizens do not automatically transmit their Irish citizenship to their offspring. Changes in legislation over time reflect evolving national policies and societal norms.",

            "answer": "Ordinary residence refers to the place where someone spends most of their time and considers themselves to be permanently located. It's distinct from legal residency which is based on citizenship status or immigration status. The concept is important for tax purposes, employment eligibility, and other administrative matters related to permanent residents. In many countries, including the United States, ordinary residence can also influence social security benefits, health insurance coverage, and voter registration. Understanding one's ordinary residence helps individuals navigate complex legal and financial systems associated with long-term living arrangements. \n\nPlease note that this explanation covers general concepts applicable across various jurisdictions. Specific details may vary depending on local laws and regulations. For precise definitions and applications, it's advisable to consult official government documents or seek professional advice tailored to specific situations.

Lack of work: for example, your employer no longer needs or has a reduced need for employees with your skills or new technology has made your job unnecessary.

            "question": "What counts as genuine redundancy?",
            "answer": "Genuine redundancy is when there are no real job tasks that remain after a person has been laid off. It occurs when employees have had their jobs eliminated due to automation, outsourcing, restructuring, downsizing, mergers and acquisitions, or other reasons. Genuine redundancy involves people losing their jobs because of changes in business operations rather than being fired for poor performance or lack of skills. The key characteristic is that all remaining jobs do not require the employee's specific skills or expertise. This type of redundancy does not involve layoffs where employees are let go without any work left for them to do. To qualify as genuine redundancy, the organization must be able to prove that they were unable to reassign existing roles within the company or that new roles could not be created.",

            "answer": "A GP (General Practitioner) visit card is a type of identification card used by General Practitioners when they see patients for medical consultations. It typically includes basic personal and contact information such as name, address, phone number, email, and sometimes additional details like allergies or previous illnesses. The purpose of the card is primarily informational and does not provide health insurance coverage or other financial benefits. These cards are usually issued at patient registration during their first appointment with a GP to help them keep track of who has seen whom and to facilitate communication between healthcare providers and patients. They are often required for certain administrative tasks related to healthcare services provided through primary care settings. While some hospitals might require similar forms of ID documentation from patients, GP visit cards are specific to general practitioners' practices and serve a particular function within that context. \n\nThis answer provides key information about what a GP visit card is, its typical contents, and why it's useful for healthcare professionals.",

It can also be used to renovate vacant and derelict properties that have not been used as residential properties before. However, this only applies if the non-residential properties were used for commercial or public use before and now have the correct planning permission. You can get the grant if you are refurbishing the vacant property so you can live there, or so you can rent the property out. You can get a grant of up to \u20ac50,000 to renovate a vacant property and up to \u20ac70,000, if the property is derelict. You can get more if you are living on an off-shore island. And, there is an additional grant for expert conservation advice if you are refurbishing a vacant traditional farmhouse. The Vacant Property Refurbishment Grant is funded by the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage through the Cro\u00ed C\u00f3naithe (Towns) Fund and you apply to your local authority.

            "answer": "The Vacant Property Refurbishment Grant (VPRG) is a grant program offered by the Victorian Government of Australia that provides funding for property owners who wish to renovate their vacant properties. The aim of this initiative is to improve the value and potential use of vacant properties while also addressing environmental concerns through sustainable design practices. To be eligible, applicants must meet certain criteria such as having at least one vacant property within their ownership or leasehold period. The grants are typically available for projects costing between $50,000 and $2 million, depending on the size and complexity of the renovation work. Successful applicants receive funding towards materials, labor, and other expenses associated with the refurbishment project. This program supports local communities by creating jobs and improving living conditions in areas where there might otherwise be unused buildings. It aligns with broader goals of economic development and sustainability.",

            "answer": "A valid reason for ending a tenancy after the first six months could be non-payment of rent. The landlord has the right to terminate the lease if the tenant fails to pay rent on time and in full. This ensures that the property remains occupied by someone who is legally obligated to maintain it and fulfill their contractual obligations under the lease agreement. Additionally, if there are issues such as damage caused by the tenant, the landlord might choose to end the tenancy until repairs are made or damages are addressed. In some cases, landlords may also use this provision to prevent future tenants from causing similar problems by terminating the lease early when they become aware of potential issues before the start of the rental period. It's important for both parties involved to clearly define payment terms in the initial lease agreement to avoid misunderstandings later on. \n\nThis helps ensure fairness and accountability while allowing landlords to take necessary actions based on the agreed-upon conditions without extending the lease indefinitely for no reason.",

In most countries, driving under the influence (DUI) is considered a serious offense that results in penalties such as license suspension or revocation, fines, community service, and possible imprisonment. The specific details of how these penalties are enforced vary depending on the jurisdiction and the type of violation. For example, in the United States, if someone is caught driving while intoxicated, they could face additional charges like reckless endangerment, which could lead to even more severe consequences, including jail time and higher penalties for repeat offenses. It's important to note that this is not applicable to all jurisdictions globally and the exact process can differ based on local regulations and statutes. However, it does serve as a good general guide. \n\nThe key takeaway from this explanation is that penalty points represent a form of punishment for violations, often related to legal actions outside of regular traffic laws.",

This amount varies widely depending on factors like years of service, length of notice given, and the nature of the job position. For more detailed information tailored to your specific situation, it would be advisable to look into local labor laws or contact a professional human resources consultant.",

This means that if you have a pre-nuptial agreement in place and you end up in court following the breakdown of your marriage, the judge is not bound by the terms of the pre-nuptial agreement. The only provision in Irish law is under sections 113 and 113A of the Succession Act 1965 (as amended) where a spouse or a civil partner can renounce his/her legal right share in a pre-nuptial agreement. Although they are not legally binding, there is nothing in Irish law which stops a couple planning to marry from having and signing a pre-nuptial agreement. Importantly, such agreements can serve as guides for the courts in judicial separation and divorce cases. If a pre-nuptial agreement makes \u2018proper provision\u2019 for each person it is more likely to be persuasive on the judge.

In some countries, such as Italy, France, Spain, and Germany, pre-nuptial agreements are considered legally binding contracts that must be executed according to strict procedural requirements. In other jurisdictions, like Sweden, Finland, and Norway, pre-nuptial agreements are recognized as private agreements between spouses that do not require formal court approval for their validity. However, there are still cases where courts may intervene if they consider the agreement unfair or unconscionable. The enforceability of pre-nuptial agreements also depends on whether both parties voluntarily entered into them and had adequate time to consult with legal counsel before signing. It's important for individuals considering entering into a pre-nuptial agreement to seek professional advice from experienced family law attorneys familiar with the local laws and regulations regarding this type of contract.",

            "question": "Who regulates aviation in Ireland?",
            "answer": "The regulation of aviation in Ireland is primarily handled by the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), which was established in 1985 under the Civil Aviation Act 1985. The CAA has jurisdiction over all aspects of air traffic control and safety, including flight operations, airport management, and airspace regulations. Additionally, the Department of Transport plays a significant role in aviation policy and oversight, collaborating closely with the CAA on matters related to air transport. Both entities work together to ensure compliance with international standards and maintain public safety in Irish skies. For more detailed information about their roles and responsibilities, one should refer to official sources such as the CAA's website or reports from the Department of Transport. \n\n---\n\nIn summary, the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) regulates aviation in Ireland, while the Department of Transport provides oversight and collaboration. These bodies work together to ensure compliance with international standards and maintain public safety. Further details can be found on the respective authorities' websites.",

            "ground_truth": "Under the Cycle to Work Scheme (also known as the Bike to Work Scheme), you can get a new bike tax free through your work. Your employer pays for a new bike and then you repay the cost of regular instalments from your gross (overall) salary. You do not have to pay tax, PRSI or the Universal Social Charge on your repayments. Not every employer takes part in the scheme. However, if they do, they must offer it to all their employees. If you are self-employed, you cannot take part in the Cycle to Work Scheme unless you pay PRSI as an employee in addition to your self-employed work.",
            "question": "What is the Cycle to Work Scheme?",
            "answer": "The Cycle to Work Scheme (CTWS) was introduced by the UK government in 2001 as part of its Green Deal initiative. It allows employees to purchase and keep cycle-related equipment such as bicycles and cycles from their employers for personal use at no cost to themselves. The scheme encourages individuals to reduce carbon emissions through cycling, which is seen as a more sustainable alternative to driving. Under CTWS, eligible employees can claim back a percentage of the total cost of the purchased equipment directly from their employer's payroll, subject to certain eligibility criteria including age, employment status, and income levels. To qualify for the scheme, employees must meet specific conditions regarding health and safety requirements that apply when using bikes on public roads. While CTWS has been successful in promoting cycling among employees, some critics argue it may not be financially viable for businesses due to high initial investment costs and potential administrative burdens.",
