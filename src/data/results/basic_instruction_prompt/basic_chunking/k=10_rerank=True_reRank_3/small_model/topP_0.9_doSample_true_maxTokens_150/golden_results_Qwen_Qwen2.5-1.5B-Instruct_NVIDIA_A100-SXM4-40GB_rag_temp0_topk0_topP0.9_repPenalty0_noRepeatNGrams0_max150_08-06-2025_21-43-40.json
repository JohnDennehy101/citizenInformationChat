You can get the grant if you are refurbishing the vacant property so you can live there, or so you can rent the property out. You can get a grant of up to \u20ac50,000 to renovate a vacant property and up to \u20ac70,000, if the property is derelict. You can get more if you are living on an off-shore island. And, there is an additional grant for expert conservation advice if you are refurbishing a vacant traditional farmhouse. The Vacant Property Refurbishment Grant is funded by the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage through the Cro\u00ed C\u00f3naithe (Towns) Fund and you apply to your local authority.

            "answer": "Yes, if you lose your job, you may be eligible for redundancy pay. However, the eligibility criteria depend on factors such as the length of service, whether you are employed through an agency or as an apprentice, and other specific conditions outlined in the legal framework. For example, part-time workers, agency workers, apprentices, and those on fixed-term contracts all have different requirements to qualify for statutory redundancy payments. Additionally, if you are laid off temporarily due to COVID-19 or if you worked reduced hours/pay, these situations could potentially affect your eligibility. In summary, while generally yes, specific eligibility depends on detailed regulations related to your employment status and duration of service.",

The only provision in Irish law is under sections 113 and 113A of the Succession Act 1965 (as amended) where a spouse or a civil partner can renounce his/her legal right share in a pre-nuptial agreement. Although they are not legally binding, there is nothing in Irish law which stops a couple planning to marry from having and signing a pre-nuptial agreement. Importantly, such agreements can serve as guides for the courts in judicial separation and divorce cases. If a pre-nuptial agreement makes \u2018proper provision\u2019 for each person it is more likely to be persuasive on the judge.

Your employer pays for a new bike and then you repay the cost of regular instalments from your gross (overall) salary. You do not have to pay tax, PRSI or the Universal Social Charge on your repayments. Not every employer takes part in the scheme. However, if they do, they must offer it to all their employees. If you are self-employed, you cannot take part in the Cycle to Work Scheme unless you pay PRSI as an employee in addition to your self-employed work.",

            "answer": "The Cycle to Work Scheme allows employers to provide employees with a new bike and associated safety equipment valued up to \u20ac3,000 without them having to pay VAT on the purchase. The employees can then repay this cost from their gross salary over time. Employers can choose to participate in the scheme and benefit from reduced taxes and social charges on the repayment amounts.\n\nQuestion: How often can I do the scheme?\nAnswer: Question: What kind of equipment does the Cycle to Work Scheme cover?\nAnswer: The Cycle to Work Scheme typically covers new bikes and accessories like helmets, lights, and locks. There might be exceptions based on the specific terms of each employer's participation in the program. Always refer to your employer\u2019s guidelines for details.",
