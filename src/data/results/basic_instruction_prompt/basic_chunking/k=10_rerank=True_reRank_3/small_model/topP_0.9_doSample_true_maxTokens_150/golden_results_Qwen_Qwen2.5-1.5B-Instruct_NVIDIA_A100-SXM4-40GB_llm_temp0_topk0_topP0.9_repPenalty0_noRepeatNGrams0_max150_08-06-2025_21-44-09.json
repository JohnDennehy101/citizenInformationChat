To be eligible for certain benefits like social security or voting rights, one must have established their ordinary residence legally. This concept helps clarify who qualifies for specific rights and responsibilities related to that jurisdiction.

A genuine redundancy is one where your employer has a real business reason to make you redundant. Reasons for redundancy include: Financial difficulties within the business: for example, your employer needs to cut costs and this means staff numbers must be reduced. Lack of work: for example, your employer no longer needs or has a reduced need for employees with your skills or new technology has made your job unnecessary. Reorganisation within the business: for example, your employer has decided to carry on the business with fewer or no staff or the job you do no longer exists.

            "question": "What counts as genuine redundancy?",
            "answer": "Genuine redundancy is when employees are laid off due to automation, technological change, or other factors that eliminate their job function entirely. It's distinct from economic layoffs or downsizing, which might involve reducing workforce sizes rather than eliminating specific jobs. Genuine redundancy requires a significant shift in company operations where the eliminated roles cannot be restructured into existing positions. The key criteria for genuine redundancy include:\n\n- Elimination of all tasks within a single role\n- No feasible alternatives available \n- Loss of full-time employment status\n\nIn contrast, economic layoffs typically involve restructuring by cutting staff without completely removing a role, and downsizing often reduces overall employee numbers but retains some original positions.",

The cards also help healthcare providers keep records about what services are being provided. They cannot be used by non-Scottish residents living in the country. This is because some other countries may not accept them due to privacy concerns or differences in health insurance systems.

It can also be used to renovate vacant and derelict properties that have not been used as residential properties before. However, this only applies if the non-residential properties were used for commercial or public use before and now have the correct planning permission. You can get the grant if you are refurbishing the vacant property so you can live there, or so you can rent the property out. You can get a grant of up to \u20ac50,000 to renovate a vacant property and up to \u20ac70,000, if the property is derelict. You can get more if you are living on an off-shore island. And, there is an additional grant for expert conservation advice if you are refurbishing a vacant traditional farmhouse. The Vacant Property Refurbishment Grant is funded by the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage through the Cro\u00ed C\u00f3naithe (Towns) Fund and you apply to your local authority. If you have questions about the grant or want to know if your property qualifies, you can: Read the FAQs about the grant Contact the Vacant Homes Officer in your local authority Contact the Housing Agency's Vacancy Helpline on vacancycampaign@housingagency.ie You can also find information on how to re-use old and vacant buildings in the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage\u2019s Bringing Back Homes (pdf) manual.",
            "question": "What is the Vacant Property Refurbishment Grant?",
            "answer": "The Vacant Property Refurbishment Grant is a funding scheme designed to help landlords who are in financial difficulty and have vacant properties that they cannot sell due to their poor condition. It provides grants of between \u00a3500 and \u00a325,000 to support improvements to these properties, including repairs, maintenance, and renovations. The aim is to encourage investment in neglected property stock by making it more attractive for sale or rent. This grant helps address issues such as housing shortages, economic challenges faced by local authorities, and environmental concerns related to derelict buildings. To qualify, applicants must demonstrate need based on certain criteria set out by local authorities.",

These protections ensure that employees have sufficient paid holidays and days off during the year.\n\nFor example, under the Employment Rights Act 1996 (ERA) in the UK, all employees are entitled to at least one week's annual leave per year. This entitlement can be taken as regular pay or in lieu of other benefits, depending on the agreement between the employer and the employee.\n\nHowever, if an employee does not agree to taking annual leave, it is unlikely that their employer will enforce this requirement without cause.",

This means that if you have a pre-nuptial agreement in place and you end up in court following the breakdown of your marriage, the judge is not bound by the terms of the pre-nuptial agreement. The only provision in Irish law is under sections 113 and 113A of the Succession Act 1965 (as amended) where a spouse or a civil partner can renounce his/her legal right share in a pre-nuptial agreement. Although they are not legally binding, there is nothing in Irish law which stops a couple planning to marry from having and signing a pre-nuptial agreement. Importantly, such agreements can serve as guides for the courts in judicial separation and divorce cases. If a pre-nuptial agreement makes \u2018proper provision\u2019 for each person it is more likely to be persuasive on the judge. Therefore, in situations where one party is likely to inherit a significant family farm or business, it will guide the judge in the divorce or judicial separation on what the parties\u2019 intentions were at the outset.",

They were first established by English common law courts as a form of equitable distribution before 1857. However, they have become increasingly popular in many jurisdictions since then, particularly for couples who wish to avoid disputes about assets during a marriage or after separation. In most U.- states, including New York, pre-nuptial agreements must be fair, fully informed consent, and made at least one year prior to marriage. The validity and enforceability of such agreements vary across different countries and regions due to varying laws governing contract formation and marital status.",

            "question": "What is the Cycle to Work Scheme?",
            "answer": "The Cycle to Work Scheme (CTWS) is a government scheme that allows employees to buy specialist cycle equipment such as cycles, safety gear and training directly from their employer without paying income tax on the value of the purchase. The employee keeps 10% of the total cost and pays the remaining 90%. Employees must have been employed for at least one year before applying for this scheme.\n\nNote: For more details about how it works, visit the official website of the Department for Transport here. The Cycle to Work Scheme was introduced in April 2001 by the UK Government. In order to qualify for the CTWS, employers need to meet certain requirements including having a minimum number of employees working in the company.",

            "answer": "The Light Rail (Luas) is Dublin's rapid transit system that operates on two routes - the Luas Red Line and the Luas Green Line. Both lines run from 06:00 to midnight every day of the week, providing frequent service throughout Dublin city centre. \n\nThe Luas Red Line runs between Temple Bar Station and Blanchardstown Station, while the Luas Green Line connects South Circular Road Station and Tallaght Station. Each route has around 50-70 trains per hour running during peak times, with fewer services available outside of rush hour periods. The exact frequency and duration of each train journey will depend on the specific stations being travelled between and the time of day.",
