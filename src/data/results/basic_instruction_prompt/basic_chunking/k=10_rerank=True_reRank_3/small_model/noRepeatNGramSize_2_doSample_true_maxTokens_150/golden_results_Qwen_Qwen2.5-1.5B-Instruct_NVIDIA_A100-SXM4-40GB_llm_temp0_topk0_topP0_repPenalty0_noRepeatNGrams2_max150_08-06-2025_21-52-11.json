Lack of work: for example, your employer no longer needs or has a reduced need for employees with your skills or new technology has made your job unnecessary.

It is characterized by careful planning and coordination between management and labor unions, ensuring that redundancies are necessary for the company's survival. The goal is not just to reduce workforce size but also to minimize negative impacts on affected individuals and maintain social stability. This approach requires clear communication, negotiation, and adherence to legal standards regarding severance pay and other benefits. By focusing on genuine redundancy, companies aim to create more sustainable employment practices that benefit both the organization and its workers.",

            "question": "What is the Vacant Property Refurbishment Grant?",
            "answer": "The Vacancy Refinancing Program (VRP) was created by Congress as part of the 2009 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. It provides funding for property owners who have vacant properties that are not being used or managed properly. The VRP offers grants to help property managers renovate and rehabilitate these properties, thereby improving their value and generating tax revenue. To qualify, applicants must meet specific eligibility criteria, such as having at least $50,060 in annual gross income from rental sources, owning the property outright, and demonstrating financial need. Additionally, they must demonstrate a commitment to long-term management of their properties through lease agreements.",

This means that if you have a pre-nuptial agreement in place and you end up in court following the breakdown of your marriage, the judge is not bound by the terms of the pre-nuptial agreement. The only provision in Irish law is under sections 113 and 113A of the Succession Act 1965 (as amended) where a spouse or a civil partner can renounce his/her legal right share in a pre-nuptial agreement. Although they are not legally binding, there is nothing in Irish law which stops a couple planning to marry from having and signing a pre-nuptial agreement. Importantly, such agreements can serve as guides for the courts in judicial separation and divorce cases. If a pre-nuptial agreement makes \u2018proper provision\u2019 for each person it is more likely to be persuasive on the judge. Therefore, in situations where one party is likely to inherit a significant family farm or business, it will guide the judge in the divorce or judicial separation on what the parties\u2019 intentions were at the outset.",

They were originally designed as a tool for wealthy couples to protect their wealth during marriage and after it ends. However, today's prenups cover a wide range of issues, including property division, support payments, and even child custody arrangements. While some courts have ruled them invalid due to lack of consent or undue influence, others have upheld them based on fairness and mutual agreement. In many jurisdictions, pre- and postnuptials are considered private matters and cannot be enforced by law outside of marriage. For instance, California allows premarital agreements, while most states prohibit post-marriage agreements.",
