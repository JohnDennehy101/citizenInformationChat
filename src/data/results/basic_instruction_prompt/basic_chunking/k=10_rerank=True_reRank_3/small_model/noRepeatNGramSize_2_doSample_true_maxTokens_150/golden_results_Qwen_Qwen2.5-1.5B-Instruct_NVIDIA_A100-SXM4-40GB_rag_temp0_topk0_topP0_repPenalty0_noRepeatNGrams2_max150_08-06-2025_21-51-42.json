Ordinary residents are taxed according to their long-term residency, regardless of how much time they spent outside the area.

It can also be used to renovate vacant and derelict properties that have not been used as residential properties before. However, this only applies if the non-residential properties were used for commercial or public use before and now have the correct planning permission. You can get the grant if you are refurbishing the vacant property so you can live there, or so you can rent the property out. You can get a grant of up to \u20ac50,000 to renovate a vacant property and up to \u20ac70,000, if the property is derelict. You can get more if you are living on an off-shore island. And, there is an additional grant for expert conservation advice if you are refurbishing a vacant traditional farmhouse. The Vacant Property Refurbishment Grant is funded by the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage through the Cro\u00ed C\u00f3naithe (Towns) Fund and you apply to your local authority. If you have questions about the grant or want to know if your property qualifies, you can: Read the FAQs about the grant Contact the Vacant Homes Officer in your local authority Contact the Housing Agency's Vacancy Helpline on vacancycampaign@housingagency.ie You can also find information on how to re-use old and vacant buildings in the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage\u2019s Bringing Back Homes (pdf) manual.",

            "ground_truth": "Pre-nuptial agreements have no basis in law in Ireland. As a result, they are not strictly binding. This means that if you have a pre-nuptial agreement in place and you end up in court following the breakdown of your marriage, the judge is not bound by the terms of the pre-nuptial agreement. The only provision in Irish law is under sections 113 and 113A of the Succession Act 1965 (as amended) where a spouse or a civil partner can renounce his/her legal right share in a pre-nuptial agreement. Although they are not legally binding, there is nothing in Irish law which stops a couple planning to marry from having and signing a pre-nuptial agreement. Importantly, such agreements can serve as guides for the courts in judicial separation and divorce cases. If a pre-nuptial agreement makes \u2018proper provision\u2019 for each person it is more likely to be persuasive on the judge. Therefore, in situations where one party is likely to inherit a significant family farm or business, it will guide the judge in the divorce or judicial separation on what the parties\u2019 intentions were at the outset.",
            "question": "What is the legal status of pre-nuptial agreements?",
            "answer": "Pre-prenuptials agreements are legal instruments used to manage financial aspects like inheritance, support, and ownership during marriage. However, because they aren\u2019t officially recognized in laws, these agreements lack formal legal binding power. They're primarily advisory tools for judges when resolving disputes over marital dissolution. Despite lacking legal force, prenups can influence court decisions significantly due to their role in guiding equitable distribution of wealth upon divorce. Document 3::: No specific document provided.\n```\n\nBased on this information, we can conclude:\n\nPre-Nuptual agreements do exist, but they lack legal standing in most jurisdictions, including Ireland, meaning they\u2019re not considered legally enforceible contracts. Their primary purpose is to offer guidance to courts during divorce proceedings.",

You do not have to pay tax, PRSI or the Universal Social Charge on your repayments. Not every employer takes part in the scheme. However, if they do, they must offer it to all their employees.

            "answer": "The cycle to workscheme is a program where employers can buy new bikes and safety gear for their staff members, allowing them to repay this expense from the staff's gross salaries. The goal is to encourage more people to cycle by making it easier and cheaper to do so. Employers can choose between different types of cycles, including cargo, electric, other, etc., with specific spending caps based on their model. Repayment terms vary among models; however, repayment typically comes from employees' salaries after taxes, pensions, universal social charges, which helps reduce financial burden during the repayment period. For instance, under the current system, a high-income individual would save approximately half the price of an expensive bicycle when repaying the loan.",
