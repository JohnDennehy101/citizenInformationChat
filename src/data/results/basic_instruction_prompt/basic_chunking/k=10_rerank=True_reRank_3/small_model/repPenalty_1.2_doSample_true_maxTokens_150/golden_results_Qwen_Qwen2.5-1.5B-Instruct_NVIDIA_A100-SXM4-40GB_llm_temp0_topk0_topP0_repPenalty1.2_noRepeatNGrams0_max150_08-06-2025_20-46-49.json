Lack of work: for example, your employer no longer needs or has a reduced need for employees with your skills or new technology has made your job unnecessary. Reorganisation within the business: for example, your employer has decided to carry on the business with fewer or no staff or the job you do no longer exists.

            "question": "What counts as genuine redundancy?",
            "answer": "Genuine redundancy is when employees are laid off due to automation and technology replacing their jobs entirely without offering them new ones elsewhere within the company that would require similar skills. This contrasts with other types of layoffs where people might be reassigned to different roles or retained on less demanding positions. The key characteristic for being considered genuine redundancy involves the complete elimination of employment opportunities related to those individuals' former duties at the employer. Companies often use this term to describe situations where they cannot afford to keep someone who does not have alternative job prospects available immediately after technological advancements render certain tasks obsolete.",

The only provision in Irish law is under sections 113 and 113A of the Succession Act 1965 (as amended) where a spouse or a civil partner can renounce his/her legal right share in a pre-nuptial agreement. Although they are not legally binding, there is nothing in Irish law which stops a couple planning to marry from having and signing a pre-nuptial agreement. Importantly, such agreements can serve as guides for the courts in judicial separation and divorce cases. If a pre-nuptial agreement makes \u2018proper provision\u2019 for each person it is more likely to be persuasive on the judge.
