A genuine redundancy is one where your employer has a real business reason to make you redundant. Reasons for redundancy include: Financial difficulties within the business: for example, your employer needs to cut costs and this means staff numbers must be reduced. Lack of work: for example, your employer no longer needs or has a reduced need for employees with your skills or new technology has made your job unnecessary. Reorganisation within the business: for example, your employer has decided to carry on the business with fewer or no staff or the job you do no longer exists.

            "question": "What counts as genuine redundancy?",
            "answer": "Genuine redundancy requires employers to provide evidence supporting the necessity of layoffs based upon financial hardship, lack of necessary labour resources, technological advancements necessitating automation, reorganization within businesses requiring reductions in personnel, or planned closures/cancellations. Additionally, such situations entail clear justification provided through consultation processes prior to initiating employee layoff plans; otherwise deemed 'genuine' circumstances typically involve substantial operational adjustments aimed towards enhancing overall organizational efficiency rather than curtailing staffing levels solely to cope with external pressures like cost-cutting measures imposed externally by shareholders or lenders seeking profit maximization strategies detrimental to long-standing labor relations. The absence of compelling evidence leading to justified decisions regarding mass layoffs will render them inherently illegitimate claims unless substantiated via documented compliance adherence mechanisms outlined hereinbefore.",

It can also be used to renovate vacant and derelict properties that have not been used as residential properties before. However, this only applies if the non-residential properties were used for commercial or public use before and now have the correct planning permission. You can get the grant if you are refurbishing the vacant property so you can live there, or so you can rent the property out. You can get a grant of up to \u20ac50,000 to renovate a vacant property and up to \u20ac70,000, if the property is derelict. You can get more if you are living on an off-shore island. And, there is an additional grant for expert conservation advice if you are refurbishing a vacant traditional farmhouse. The Vacant Property Refurbishment Grant is funded by the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage through the Cro\u00ed C\u00f3naithe (Towns) Fund and you apply to your local authority.

This means that if you have a pre-nuptial agreement in place and you end up in court following the breakdown of your marriage, the judge is not bound by the terms of the pre-nuptial agreement. The only provision in Irish law is under sections 113 and 113A of the Succession Act 1965 (as amended) where a spouse or a civil partner can renounce his/her legal right share in a pre-nuptial agreement. Although they are not legally binding, there is nothing in Irish law which stops a couple planning to marry from having and signing a pre-nuptial agreement. Importantly, such agreements can serve as guides for the courts in judicial separation and divorce cases. If a pre-nuptial agreement makes \u2018proper provision\u2019 for each person it is more likely to be persuasive on the judge. Therefore, in situations where one party is likely to inherit a significant family farm or business, it will guide the judge in the divorce or judicial separation on what the parties\u2019 intentions were at the outset.",
            "question": "What is the legal status of pre-nuptial agreements?",
            "answer": "According to Irish law, pre-nuptial agreements lack formal recognition due to them not forming a basis in legislation. Consequently, while they're allowed, judges aren\u2019t compelled to adhere to their stipulations during matrimonial disputes. However, despite lacking statutory backing, such agreements still function as guiding principles when determining claims involving inheritance post-divorce proceedings. They often play a pivotal role because adherence implies clear intent at the time of engagement. Moreover, provisions ensuring fairness\u2014such as reviewing clauses periodically\u2014are crucial aspects of drafting sound prenups. \n\nThis summary encapsulates the key points without delving too deeply into specific details found elsewhere in the provided material.",

            "answer": "The Department of Transport regulations regulate air transport in Ireland, which includes both commercial and private services. Additionally, there's the Irish Aviation Authority (IAA). Document 2 mentions that while the IAA deals primarily with domestic issues like air transportation, some international matters still fall under different bodies such as the National Consumer Agency, where disputes involving foreign companies might be handled differently than domestically. For instance, the Air Passenger Rights provided by the IAA apply specifically to situations regarding disruptions caused by airlines operating internationally rather than just those flying between two nations inside the EU/EEA area covered by the European Parliament directives mentioned earlier.",

Employers can apply to participate in this initiative, which covers both cash payments made directly to employees and reimbursement of installment-based purchases within prescribed limits. Under this system, workers receive funds upfront without having to worry about taxation, national insurance contributions, or universal social charges since those deductions happen after repayment has been completed.",
