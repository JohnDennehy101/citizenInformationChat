The user has provided a text about mental health services for children and young people in Ireland and wants me to act as an expert educator. My job is to come up with one simple question and a clear answer based on the text.\n\nFirst, I'll read through the text carefully. It starts by talking about the overwhelm parents might feel when their child has mental health issues. It mentions various support services like websites, helplines, and different organizations. It also categorizes services into primary care, specialist, private, and non-profit sectors. The text emphasizes that even mild issues can be serious and that knowing how to access services is important.\n\nNow, I need to think about what a student or someone new to this topic might find confusing. The text lists several services but doesn't go into detail about each one. So, a question about the types of services available would make sense. It's straightforward and directly related to the content.\n\nI should phrase the question in a way that's easy to understand. Maybe something like, \"What types of mental health services are available for children and young people in Ireland?\" That covers the main categories without being too specific.\n\nFor the answer, I need to list the services mentioned in the text. The primary ones are GPs, primary care, specialist services, private services, and non-profit organizations. I should mention each briefly to give a clear overview.\n\nI also need to ensure the answer is concise and uses simple language. No need for jargon or detailed explanations—just the basics so someone new can grasp it quickly.\n\nPutting it all together, the question and answer should help someone understand the different services available without overwhelming them with too much detail at once.\n</think>\n\n**Question**:  \nWhat types of mental health services are available for children and young people in Ireland?\n\n**Answer**:  \nMental health services for children and young people in Ireland include general practitioner (GP) services, primary care services, specialist services, private mental health care services, and non-profit organizations.
