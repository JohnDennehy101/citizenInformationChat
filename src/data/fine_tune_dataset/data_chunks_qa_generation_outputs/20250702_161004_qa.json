This provision is significant because it shifts the usual rule that such statements are only admissible to impeach the witness's credibility, not as substantive evidence of the facts. \n\nFor a pre-trial statement to be admitted under Section 16, the court must be satisfied of the following conditions:\n1. **Voluntariness**: The statement must have been made voluntarily by the witness.\n2. **Reliability**: The statement must be reliable.\n3. **Admissibility**: The facts contained in the statement would be admissible if the witness had testified about them in court.\n4. **Affirmation**: The witness must have signed an affirmation, such as a statutory declaration, stating that the statement was true, or the court must be satisfied that the witness understood the obligation to tell the truth.\n\nThis provision is particularly useful in cases where a witness's credibility is in question, as it allows the prosecution or defense to use the pre-trial statement as substantive evidence, provided the conditions are met. However, the judge must clearly instruct the jury that the statement is only being admitted to assess the witness's credibility unless Section 16 is invoked. This ensures that the jury understands the limited purpose of the statement unless it is admitted as substantive evidence under the specific conditions outlined in the statute.",
