They can also qualify for a medical card if their weekly income is below a certain threshold. The income limits are €550 for single persons and €1,050 for couples, based on the gross weekly income before taxes. Additionally, if their only income comes from social welfare or HSE payments, they qualify regardless of income exceeding the means test rate.\n\n2. **Means Test Exceptions for Over 70s**: The means test for over 70s does not assess property, only income, savings, and investments. This is a notable exception compared to the means test for those under 70, where property may be considered.\n\n3. **Eligibility for Couples**: For couples where one is over 70 and the other is under 70, both qualify for a medical card if their combined income does not exceed €1,050 weekly. If one partner dies, the surviving spouse can retain the medical card for three years, provided their income remains below the couple's limit. After three years, the single person income limit applies.\n\n4. **Impact on Eligibility**: These differences mean that individuals over 70 have a more straightforward path to qualifying for medical cards, as they are exempt from property assessments and have higher income thresholds. Those under 70 face a more stringent means test, which may include property, and have lower income limits, making it harder to qualify.\n\nIn summary, the means test for over 70s is more lenient, focusing solely on income, savings, and investments, while exempting property. This makes it easier for older individuals to qualify for medical cards. In contrast, those under 70 face a more comprehensive means test, which can include property, making eligibility more challenging.",
