The introduction of new offences, such as stalking and non-fatal strangulation, with increased maximum sentences, indicates a recognition of the severity of these acts and their impact on victims. Similarly, the enhancement of penalties for crimes like assaulting on-duty Garda or emergency service workers, assault causing harm, and conspiracy to murder underscores a commitment to deterring such offences and protecting vulnerable individuals and key public servants.\n\nThese changes have the potential to impact Irish society in several ways. They may lead to a greater sense of security among the public, particularly women and other vulnerable groups, by sending a clear message that such behaviours will not be tolerated. However, they also raise questions about the balance between punitive measures and rehabilitative approaches. The increased sentences could deter potential offenders but may also strain prison resources and necessitate investments in judicial and correctional systems. Additionally, the improved legal frameworks for rights of part-time workers, patient advocacy, and legal aid for asylum seekers reflect a broader commitment to social justice and equality, potentially fostering a more inclusive society. Overall, these provisions aim to address both immediate safety concerns and long-term societal well-being, though their full impact will depend on their implementation and the broader socio-legal context.",
