This is known as tax relief at source.\n\nHowever, in some situations tax relief at source does not apply, for example, where an employer pays the medical insurance premiums on behalf of an employee. This is treated as a Benefit in Kind and tax is due on the total amount.\n\nThis means that the employee does not get the tax relief at source on the insurance premium. You can instead make a claim directly to Revenue .\n\nThe relief is given at the rate of 20% of the cost. This is up to a maximum of €1,000 per adult and €500 per child. A child is someone under 21 years of age that a child premium has been paid for.\n\nRates\n\nTax relief on medical and health expenses is given at the standard rate of 20%.\n\nHowever, tax relief on nursing home expenses can be claimed at your highest rate of tax. This means that the portion of your income which is taxable at your highest rate of tax is reduced.\n\nHow to apply\n\nYou must claim tax relief within the 4 years that follow the year you paid for the healthcare.\n\nIf you received healthcare in one year but paid for it the following year, you can choose to claim the relief for either year.\n\nApply online\n\nIf you are a PAYE (Pay As You Earn) taxpayer, you can claim tax relief online using myAccount .\n\nIf are a self-assessed taxpayer, use Revenue Online Service (ROS) and complete the health expenses section on your annual Income Tax Return (Form 11).\n\nReceipts\n\nYou can only claim for medical expenses if you have receipts to prove your claim. For dental expenses, your dentist should complete Form Med 2 (pdf) for you to use as a receipt.",
