        "answerText": " Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage (Deputy James Browne)  I propose to take Questions Nos. 257, 261, 262 and 264 together.  The Residential Tenancies Acts 2004-2025 (the RTA) regulate the landlord-tenant relationship in the private rented sector and sets out the rights and obligations of landlords and tenants. The RTA apply to every dwelling that is the subject of a tenancy, subject to a limited number of exceptions. Section 3(2) of the RTA prescribes the dwellings to which that Act does not apply including a dwelling let to a person whose entitlement to occupation is for the purpose of a holiday only and a dwelling within which the landlord also resides.  Where a dwelling is occupied by a person under an arrangement or agreement which is not a tenancy covered by the RTA, for example, where a bona fide licensing arrangement exists, the RTB does not have any jurisdiction or function. It is a private contractual matter between the parties as to type of agreement/arrangement to put in place. If a dispute arises as to whether a purported license is in fact a tenancy, the RTB can determine on the matter and if it is a tenancy, the RTA applies.  Under section 3A of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended, \"the Minister may make regulations requiring such persons as are specified in the regulations to provide a planning authority with such information as may be so specified and at such intervals as may be so specified in relation to short term lettings in the administrative area of the planning authority\". Legislative reforms to regulate the short term letting sector - as provided for in the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2019 and supplementary regulations (Planning and Development Act 2000 (Exempted Development) (No. 2) Regulations 2019) came into effect on 1 July 2019. The provisions of the Regulations include the following:  • Short term letting is defined as the letting of a house or apartment, or part of a house or apartment, for any period not exceeding 14 days;  • Where a person owns a property in a Rent Pressure Zone which is not their principal private residence and intends to let it for short-term letting purposes, s/he is required to apply for a change of use planning permission unless the property already has a specific planning permission to be used for tourism or short-term letting purposes.  A person engaged in short-term letting of part of their principal private residence (PPR) does not generally require planning permission to do so. Short term letting of an entire PPR does require planning permission where such letting occurs for a total of more than 90 days per year. Such letting must not contravene any planning condition and must be consistent with any use, specified in the original planning permission.  The primary objective of that legislation is to regulate short-term letting through the planning code in the context of its impact on the supply of private rented accommodation. Responsibility for the implementation and enforcement of planning legislation is a matter for planning authorities.  It is important that there is a clear view, both at national level and local authority level, as to the overall policy approach to determining planning applications for Short Term Lets.  The Government has recently agreed a policy to generally preclude new planning permissions for Short term letting in cities and towns with a Census population in excess of 10,000 persons, at the most recent Census of Population. It was further agreed that local authorities should have discretion to develop policies for other locations having regard to relevant local criteria to be set out in the guidance. This guidance will be introduced in the form of a National Planning Statement (NPS).  My Department is currently developing a NPS for the Short-Term Letting sector to supplement and support the introduction of the Short-Term Letting and Tourism (STLT) Bill. It will consider a variety of factors, such as existing planning legislation, the long-term housing need in the local authority area, the location of the proposed Short-Term Let and balancing housing need with the potential impact on tourism and economic development.  Further to a review of the current provisions as operated by local authorities under the planning code, the Government agreed a specific action in Housing for All (action 20.4) to “develop new regulatory controls requiring short-term and holiday lets to register with Fáilte Ireland.” The General Scheme of the Short-Term Letting and Tourism Bill was submitted to Government by the Minister for Enterprise, Tourism and Employment in April 2025 and approved for priority legal drafting - https://enterprise.gov.ie/en/legislation/general-scheme-short-term-letting-and-tourism-bill-2025.html. The Bill will provide for new regulatory controls requiring short-term and holiday lets to register with Fáilte Ireland with a view to ensuring that houses are used to best effect in areas of housing need. Additionally, the Bill will provide for implementing measures necessary to give effect to the Short-Term Rental Regulation (EU) 2024/1028.  On 10 June 2025, the Government approved policy measures to provide for: the enhancement to rent controls and tenancy protections for new tenancies created (i.e. first time tenancy between parties) from 1 March 2026; and as an interim measure, to draft legislation on the basis of Heads provided to it to extend and expand the operation of Rent Pressure Zones (RPZs) across the entire country until 28 February 2026.  The new measures have been informed by the findings of the Housing Agency Review of Rent Pressure Zones and Potential Policy Options and its preferred recommendation to modify the existing operation of the current RPZ rent controls. On 17 June 2025, the Government approved the publication of the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Bill 2025 for priority enactment.  The Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2025 came into operation on 20 June 2025 and provides for a two-month extension, until 28 February 2026, of the operation of all existing RPZs and the deeming of other areas, not currently designated as RPZs, to become RPZs from 20 June 2025 until 28 February 2026.

Where a dwelling is occupied by a person under an arrangement or agreement which is not a tenancy covered by the RTA, for example, where a bona fide licensing arrangement exists, the RTB does not have any jurisdiction or function. It is a private contractual matter between the parties as to type of agreement/arrangement to put in place. If a dispute arises as to whether a purported license is in fact a tenancy, the RTB can determine on the matter and if it is a tenancy, the RTA applies.  Under section 3A of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended, \"the Minister may make regulations requiring such persons as are specified in the regulations to provide a planning authority with such information as may be so specified and at such intervals as may be so specified in relation to short term lettings in the administrative area of the planning authority\". Legislative reforms to regulate the short term letting sector - as provided for in the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2019 and supplementary regulations (Planning and Development Act 2000 (Exempted Development) (No. 2) Regulations 2019) came into effect on 1 July 2019. The provisions of the Regulations include the following:  • Short term letting is defined as the letting of a house or apartment, or part of a house or apartment, for any period not exceeding 14 days;  • Where a person owns a property in a Rent Pressure Zone which is not their principal private residence and intends to let it for short-term letting purposes, s/he is required to apply for a change of use planning permission unless the property already has a specific planning permission to be used for tourism or short-term letting purposes.  A person engaged in short-term letting of part of their principal private residence (PPR) does not generally require planning permission to do so. Short term letting of an entire PPR does require planning permission where such letting occurs for a total of more than 90 days per year. Such letting must not contravene any planning condition and must be consistent with any use, specified in the original planning permission.  The primary objective of that legislation is to regulate short-term letting through the planning code in the context of its impact on the supply of private rented accommodation. Responsibility for the implementation and enforcement of planning legislation is a matter for planning authorities.  It is important that there is a clear view, both at national level and local authority level, as to the overall policy approach to determining planning applications for Short Term Lets.  The Government has recently agreed a policy to generally preclude new planning permissions for Short term letting in cities and towns with a Census population in excess of 10,000 persons, at the most recent Census of Population. It was further agreed that local authorities should have discretion to develop policies for other locations having regard to relevant local criteria to be set out in the guidance. This guidance will be introduced in the form of a National Planning Statement (NPS).  My Department is currently developing a NPS for the Short-Term Letting sector to supplement and support the introduction of the Short-Term Letting and Tourism (STLT) Bill. It will consider a variety of factors, such as existing planning legislation, the long-term housing need in the local authority area, the location of the proposed Short-Term Let and balancing housing need with the potential impact on tourism and economic development.  Further to a review of the current provisions as operated by local authorities under the planning code, the Government agreed a specific action in Housing for All (action 20.4) to “develop new regulatory controls requiring short-term and holiday lets to register with Fáilte Ireland.” The General Scheme of the Short-Term Letting and Tourism Bill was submitted to Government by the Minister for Enterprise, Tourism and Employment in April 2025 and approved for priority legal drafting - https://enterprise.gov.ie/en/legislation/general-scheme-short-term-letting-and-tourism-bill-2025.html. The Bill will provide for new regulatory controls requiring short-term and holiday lets to register with Fáilte Ireland with a view to ensuring that houses are used to best effect in areas of housing need. Additionally, the Bill will provide for implementing measures necessary to give effect to the Short-Term Rental Regulation (EU) 2024/1028.  On 10 June 2025, the Government approved policy measures to provide for: the enhancement to rent controls and tenancy protections for new tenancies created (i.e. first time tenancy between parties) from 1 March 2026; and as an interim measure, to draft legislation on the basis of Heads provided to it to extend and expand the operation of Rent Pressure Zones (RPZs) across the entire country until 28 February 2026.  The new measures have been informed by the findings of the Housing Agency Review of Rent Pressure Zones and Potential Policy Options and its preferred recommendation to modify the existing operation of the current RPZ rent controls. On 17 June 2025, the Government approved the publication of the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Bill 2025 for priority enactment.  The Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2025 came into operation on 20 June 2025 and provides for a two-month extension, until 28 February 2026, of the operation of all existing RPZs and the deeming of other areas, not currently designated as RPZs, to become RPZs from 20 June 2025 until 28 February 2026.",

        "formatted_answer": "The plan to extend Rent Pressure Zones was informed by a review and includes measures to balance housing needs with tourism and economic impacts. It involves new regulations for short-term lets, requiring registration with Fáilte Ireland, and extends Rent Pressure Zones nationwide until 28 February 2026."

From now until 28 February 2026, annual rent increases in all tenancies are capped at the level of inflation (HICP) up to a maximum of 2%. After 1 March 2026, annual rent increases in tenancies will be capped at the level of inflation (CPI) up to a maximum of 2%. For new build apartments, annual rent increases will be capped at the level of inflation (CPI). The RTB RPZ calculator on https://rtb.ie/compliance/check-rpz-compliance/rpzcalculator/ will assist landlords to comply with the rent controls until 28 February 2026 and will be modified to assist with the implementation of the new rent control from 1 March 2026.  Further legislation will be developed later in 2025 to give effect to the policy proposals recently announced by Government, to regulate rent increases nationally and to introduce stronger protection for renters. Under the policy proposals announced, stronger tenancy protections will apply to new tenancies created from 1 March 2026. These changes will significantly enhance the current provision of tenancies of unlimited duration with the introduction of tenancies of minimum duration (TMD), involving rolling 6-year tenancies, for any new tenancy created from 1 March 2026 by a smaller landlord (with 3 or fewer tenancies) with a new tenant. In limited circumstances during a 6 year TMD, a smaller landlord will be allowed to end a tenancy. A smaller landlord will also be allowed to terminate a tenancy using the limited grounds under section 34 of the Residential Tenancies Acts 2004 to 2025 (the RTA) at the end of each 6-year period while the tenancy continues to exist.  A number of provisions will apply to mitigate the impact of TMDs on smaller landlords. A smaller landlord will be allowed to terminate a tenancy at any time if:  • the landlord intends to sell the rented dwelling due to financial hardship (to be prescribed in law) and does not wish to do so with the tenant(s) in situ;  • the landlord requires the property for himself/herself or an immediate family member (spouse/civil partner, child or parent) to occupy as a principal private residence;  • The tenant is breaching his/her tenancy obligations; or  • The property is no longer suitable to the accommodation needs of the tenant household.  In advance of the end of each 6-year period of a TMD, a smaller landlord will be allowed to serve a notice of termination under any of the existing grounds for termination. These include:  • the landlord intends to sell the property;  • the landlord/family member requires the property for occupation;  • the landlord intends to substantially refurbish/renovate the property; or  • the landlord intends to change the use of the property.  Larger landlords (with 4 or more tenancies) will not have the right to terminate a tenancy in the context of sale; landlord/family member occupation or change of use. A provision allowing for the necessary vacation of a rented dwelling (to protect tenants’ health and safety) during substantial refurbishment/renovation works will be considered. A larger landlord will have the right to terminate a tenancy where the tenant is breaching his/her tenancy obligations or the property is no longer suitable to the accommodation needs of the tenant household.  For all tenancies, landlords will have the right to reset the rent to market rent, where the rent is below market rent, between tenancies, where a tenant leaves of their own volition or has breached their tenant obligations.  For existing tenancies, landlords continue to have the right to terminate a tenancy in line with the provisions in place in the Residential Tenancies Acts that applied at the time the tenancy was created.  Legislation to give effect to these policy proposals is being prepared and will be published later this year. ",

A larger landlord will have the right to terminate a tenancy where the tenant is breaching his/her tenancy obligations or the property is no longer suitable to the accommodation needs of the tenant household.  For all tenancies, landlords will have the right to reset the rent to market rent, where the rent is below market rent, between tenancies, where a tenant leaves of their own volition or has breached their tenant obligations.  For existing tenancies, landlords continue to have the right to terminate a tenancy in line with the provisions in place in the Residential Tenancies Acts that applied at the time the tenancy was created.  Legislation to give effect to these policy proposals is being prepared and will be published later this year.",

        "formatted_answer": "On June 10, 2025, the Government approved measures enhancing rent controls and tenancy protections for new tenancies starting March 1, 2026. These measures include expanding Rent Pressure Zones (RPZs) nationwide until February 28, 2026. The Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Bill 2025 was published on June 17, 2025, and became law on June 19, 2025. The Act extended RPZs from June 20, 2025, until February 28, 2026, capping annual rent increases at HICP up to 2% during this period, and then at CPI up to 2%. New build apartments are subject to CPI caps. The RTB RPZ calculator aids landlords in compliance. Further legislation in 2025 will regulate national rents and tenant protections. Tenancies of Minimum Duration (TMD) for smaller landlords (3 or fewer tenancies) start March 1, 2026, allowing termination under specific conditions. Larger landlords (4+ tenancies) cannot terminate for sale, family use, or change of use but can for breach or unsuitability. Landlords can reset rents to market levels between tenancies if below market. Existing tenancies follow previous laws."

To progress this action, my Department has undertaken a range of consultations with key stakeholders to examine the issues, including potential changes to planning and other legislation, associated with ‘meanwhile use’, which refers to the temporary use of vacant premises, for example, while awaiting a longer term development or commercial tenancy. This included a planning workshop co-hosted with DCCS, sector representative groups, local government and Government Departments.  The output of this work will feed into the wider current review of the Planning and Development – Exempted Development Regulations which is currently underway to support as part of the phased implementation of the Planning and Development Act, 2024.

An application for DCA in respect of their child was received from the person concerned on 22 May 2025.  A Deciding Officer has disallowed the application for DCA in respect of the person concerned as per decision letter dated 23 June 2025, on the grounds that the child was not considered to satisfy the above conditions for DCA. As part of the decision process, the Deciding Officer had regard to the professional opinion of a departmental Medical Assessor (MA) in making their decision and a copy of that MA opinion was issued with the decision letter.  If the person concerned thinks this decision is incorrect, the options open to them are:  • They have a right to request a review of the decision by a Deciding Officer by contacting this office with any extra evidence they think is relevant.  • They have a right to appeal this decision directly to the Social Welfare Appeals Office (SWAO).  If they want to ask for a review before they appeal this decision, it is important that they do so as soon as possible.

        "extracted_answer": "Minister for Social Protection  Domiciliary Care Allowance (DCA) is payable to a parent / guardian in respect of a child aged under 16 who has a severe disability requiring continual or continuous care and attention substantially in excess of the care and attention normally required by a child of the same age and where the level of the child's disability is such that the child is likely to require this level of care and attention for at least 12 consecutive months.  An application for DCA in respect of their child was received from the person concerned on 22 May 2025.  A Deciding Officer has disallowed the application for DCA in respect of the person concerned as per decision letter dated 23 June 2025, on the grounds that the child was not considered to satisfy the above conditions for DCA. As part of the decision process, the Deciding Officer had regard to the professional opinion of a departmental Medical Assessor (MA) in making their decision and a copy of that MA opinion was issued with the decision letter.  If the person concerned thinks this decision is incorrect, the options open to them are:  • They have a right to request a review of the decision by a Deciding Officer by contacting this office with any extra evidence they think is relevant.  • They have a right to appeal this decision directly to the Social Welfare Appeals Office (SWAO).  If they want to ask for a review before they appeal this decision, it is important that they do so as soon as possible. However, please note if they are requesting a review of the decision, they do not need to wait for the outcome of that review to request an appeal as they are separate requests.  I hope this clarifies the position for the Deputy.",

This Government acknowledges the important role that carers, including foster carers, play and remains fully committed to supporting them. That is why I was really pleased to announce that Back-to-School Clothing and Footwear Allowance eligibility is being extended to include children for whom Foster Care Allowance is being paid.  The Back-to-School Clothing and Footwear Allowance scheme provides a once-off payment to eligible families to assist with the costs of clothing and footwear when children start or return to school each autumn. The scheme operates from June to September each year.  In order to qualify for Back-to-School Clothing and Footwear Allowance, an applicant must satisfy a number of qualifying conditions, one of which requires the applicant’s household income to be within the relevant income limits. The income limits for the scheme are increased annually as part of the budget process.  The Weekly Household Income Limits for 2025 are:     No. of Children    Income Limit      1 child    €694.00      2 children    €756.00      3 children    €818.00      4 children*    €880.00     * Limit is increased by €62 for each additional child.  The household income includes weekly social protection payments, gross income from employment, minus employees PRSI and a €20 travel allowance and any other income the household may have.  Any income from Working Family Payment, Child Benefit, Rent Supplement, Back to Work Family Dividend, Guardian’s Payments, Domiciliary Care Allowance, Blind Welfare Allowance, Foster Care Allowance, Higher Level Education grants is not assessable. Rehabilitative employment (up to €165 per week) is also not assessable.  Matters relating to foster care are the responsibility of my colleague, the Minister for Children, Disability and Equality, whose Department has overseen a significant increase in investment in foster care supports, including a 21% increase to the rates of the foster care allowance. The rates have been increased to €400 per week for children aged under 12, and €425 per week for those over 12. In 2025, this means that foster carers will receive an additional €3,900 in allowances.  In addition, Budget 2025 set out further investment and support towards children in foster care, including funding which will be used to provide an Initial Placement Payment at the beginning of each initial foster care placement from 2025. Provision has also been made for additional mileage support for foster carers who have significant travel responsibilities for children in their care.  It is expected some 2,300 children in foster care will now be eligible for the Back-to-School Clothing and Footwear Allowance and I encourage foster care families to apply for the allowance.

The question at issue in the appeal referenced by the Deputy was if the worker referred to had been working for the appellant employer under a contract of service (employee) or under a contract for services (contractor) during a particular period. The worker had received a decision from my Department on 18th November 2020 determining that he had been working as an employee and was employed at Class A.

Based on that evidence the appeal was allowed.  The Chief Appeals Officer subsequently received correspondence from the worker outlining a number of concerns he had about the Appeals Officer's decision, stating that it contained multiple errors in fact and in law. Section 318 allows the Chief Appeals Officer to revise a decision where it appears to the Chief Appeals Officer that the decision was erroneous by reason of some mistake having been made in relation to the law or the facts.

Public bodies will also be encouraged to voluntarily report less serious incidents, as well as threats and near-misses.

It was always the intention for all public bodies including technological universities to have an obligation to report significant cyber security incidents under the Bill.  The reporting of significant cyber security incidents to the Computer Security Incident Response Team (CSIRT) in the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) is an important measure to build situational awareness, identify threats and trends, and develop appropriate advice and guidance to enable organisations to detect, prevent, and mitigate cyber security threats. Public bodies will also be encouraged to voluntarily report less serious incidents, as well as threats and near-misses.  My Department is currently engaging with the Office of Parliamentary Council (OPC), the Attorney General’s Office, the NCSC and other relevant Government Departments and Agencies on the drafting of the Bill, which is at an advanced stage.  The issue raised by the Deputy will be addressed during the drafting process.",

In recent months, additional resources and staff have been assigned to my Department’s Visa Division which I expect will reduce the waiting times for all applications.The current processing times of applications for visas made by family members of non-EEA nationals varies depending on the circumstances when the application is made.

        "formatted_answer": "The Criminal Law and Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2025, published on 6 May 2025, includes measures to criminalize'sex for rent' practices. It proposes two offenses: offering accommodation in exchange for sexual activity and advertising such offers. These apply to both rental agreements and \"rent-a-room\" situations. The offenses are defined by the offer or advertisement, not the occurrence of sexual activity. The penalty for these offenses is a fine of up to €5,000. The bill is under drafting by the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel and will be referred to the Justice Committee for scrutiny before finalization."

The aim of these regulations is to ensure that owner management companies (OMCs) are financially sustainable and, under sub-section 9 of section 19 of the Act, to ensure that OMCs provide for expenditure of a non-recurring nature (i.e. sinking fund expenditure).The Multi-Unit Developments Act 2011 was enacted with the primary objective of reforming the law relating to the ownership and management of common areas of multi-unit developments (MUDs), and facilitating the fair, efficient and effective management of OMCs. The Act includes provisions relating to inter alia:  • The setting of the annual service charge payable by apartment owners in a multi-unit development;  • the establishment of a sinking fund, to fund any non-recurring expenditure; and  • the development of house rules for the operation and maintenance of their multi-unit development.  Under Section 18 of the Act, the OMC must establish and maintain a scheme for annual service charges to fund ‘ongoing expenditure reasonably incurred’ on the maintenance, insurance and repair of common areas within its control and for the provision of common services (security, legal, accounting etc.) to unit owners.  The work of my Department in relation to MUDs is necessarily guided by that of the Department for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, in view of that Department’s key policy role in this area. Any regulations that would be made under the Multi-Unit Developments Act 2011 would need to be informed by appropriate policy directions from the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, and agreed with that Department, to enable my officials to further progress the drafting of the regulations mentioned.  Under the Programme for Government, Securing Ireland’s Future, responsibility for the regulation of OMCs and the Multi-Unit Developments Act will be transferred from my Department, to the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage.

The investigation of burial arrangements in Mother and Baby institutions, including the former institution at Sean Ross Abbey, was an important part of the work of the Commission of Investigation into Mother and Baby Homes. At the request of the Commission, which had specific investigative powers, a forensic archaeological investigation was conducted at the children’s burial ground at Sean Ross Abbey. The report, which was commissioned on foot of concerns about the burial ground in Sean Ross Abbey, found that infant human burials were located across the Children’s Burial ground and these had not been impacted by any utilities or drainage works. The report notes that coffins, or evidence of coffins, were located with the majority of remains (84%).  As set out in the Final report, the Commission was satisfied that the forensic report provided clear evidence that the coffined remains of children under the age of one are buried in the designated burial ground. It noted that, without complete excavation, it was not possible to say conclusively that all of the children who died in Sean Ross were buried in the designated burial ground and that it did not consider that further investigation was warranted.  I understand that, following publication of the Commission’s final report, the then Minister engaged with a local group in relation to their concerns that a privately owned area beyond the acknowledged burial ground at Sean Ross Abbey may also contain graves. In 2023, funding was provided to the group to support them in undertaking a survey of the land in question, which was not subject to investigation by the Commission.  The group submitted a copy of the report of the survey to my Department, and, as there is no expertise in the Department to assess it, the Chief Archaeologist in the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage was asked to review it. The Chief Archaeologist’s review, which has been shared with the group concerned, concludes that the survey report is inconclusive, with no clear evidence of burials. I understand, however, that the group continues to have concerns in this regard.  The Institutional Burials Act 2022 provides a legislative basis for an intervention whereby the remains of those who died in residential institutions, and who were buried in a manifestly inappropriate manner, may be recovered and re-interred in a respectful and appropriate way. Section 7 of the 2022 Act requires that Government must be satisfied that burials have taken place and must have evidence that those burials are manifestly inappropriate in order to establish an Office of Director of Authorised Intervention to undertake an excavation and recovery of remains at a site associated with a particular institution.  Given that the designated burial ground has been forensically investigated and there is no evidence of manifestly inappropriate burials, and there is also no evidence of manifestly inappropriate burials in the area outside the designated burial ground, it is not possible to bring forward a proposal to establish an Office of Director of Authorised Intervention to excavate the site at Sean Ross Abbey.

A forensic archaeological investigation was conducted, revealing infant burials across the site, with most remains (84%) in coffins. The Commission concluded that without full excavation, it couldn't confirm all deceased children were buried there, deeming further investigation unnecessary. A local group concerned about another area received funding in 2023 for a survey, which proved inconclusive. Despite this, the group remains concerned. The Institutional Burials Act 2022 allows intervention for inappropriate burials, but as no such burials were found in the designated or additional areas, no excavation proposal was made."

Officials have met a number of times with officials from the Department of Education’s Planning and Building Unit with a view to sharing expertise and information between the Departments and identify opportunities for future developments.  A meeting took place on 4 March 2025 between senior officials in my Department and officials in the planning and building unit in the Department of Education and Youth. Matters discussed at this meeting included areas of shared interest, such as capital programme management, forward planning, and the current and future use of school buildings for early learning and childcare services.  A meeting took place on 28 April 2025 between relevant officials, which focussed on the Statutory Plan engagement process undertaken by the Department of Education and Youth.  In addition to these specific meetings, the relevant officials have also engaged a number of times on related matters, particularly through the Early Learning and Childcare Planning Matters Working Group and in relation to existing services' use of school buildings.  The potential for development of State-led facilities in tandem with the school building programme will be considered as part of the wider capital plans to develop State-led services. The Programme for Government commits for the first time to provide capital investment to build or purchase state-owned early learning and childcare facilities, to create additional capacity in areas where unmet need exists. State ownership of facilities is a very substantial and significant development and offers the potential for much greater scope to influence the nature and volume of provision available and to ensure better alignment with estimated demand.

The Guidelines are intended to ensure a consistent approach to the treatment of planning applications in respect to the land use planning aspects of early learning and childcare provision.  The Programme for Government commits to reviewing the 2001 Childcare Facilities Guidelines for Planning Authorities to ensure early learning and childcare spaces are provided and put into use.  The Early Learning and Childcare Planning Matters Working Group was established in 2024 and has met on the following occasions:  • 13 June 2024  • 15 October 2024  • 4 December 2024  • 10 February 2025  • 4 June 2025  In addition, a meeting was held by members of the group with officials from different local authorities who were nominated by the CCMA Planning and Land Use Committee on 9 June 2025.  At that meeting, background briefings were provided and there was a discussion of experiences of applying the guidelines. Issues for consideration included the need for planners to have more nuanced and detailed data to understand early learning and childcare needs at local area level; coordination between local authorities and city and county childcare committees; the potential for better coordination across developments; and determining the appropriate ratio of housing units to places to ensure sufficient provision of viable services.  Draft questions to seek further information about the experience of application of the guidelines from all local authorities are being finalised and will shortly be shared with the nominees for their feedback before wider circulation.  In addition, my officials have collated relevant information to share with local authorities to support their consideration of relevant planning applications.

Its primary role is to protect the public by regulating professions designated under the Health and Social Care Professionals Act 2005 (as amended). This includes setting the standards required for registration and maintaining professional registers for those who meet these standards.  The Deputy should note that there is no common standard for the Social Work profession in the EU/EEA. Common minimum standards apply for a number of professions including Doctors, Nurses, Midwives and more but not for Social Workers. Social Workers are therefore assessed under a General System for recognition set out in Directive 2005/36/EC.  CORU has developed a fast-track pathway for U.K. (including Northern Ireland) qualified Social Workers known as the Commonly Aligned Standards (CAS) pathway, whereby qualifications from U.K. universities have been recognised as aligned with Irish Standards. Therefore, there is no requirement for qualifications to be individually assessed, and Social Workers with a U.K qualification can progress straight to registration.  CORUs next steps for CAS is to expand to other countries where there is good alignment with the Irish standards. To date there has not been standard alignment with individual EU member states. However, the number of applications from EU member states is relatively few, compared to the number received from the U.K. and Northern Ireland.  As EU Social Workers do not have an established regulatory minimum global standard, applicants must be assessed on a case-by-case basis. CORU has received eight applications from EU Social Workers in 2025. Of these, four have been recognised. The other four are still in the application process as further information is required to proceed to assessment. ",

On 14 May, 2025 I published Path to Universal Healthcare: Sláintecare & Programme for Government 2025+ (Sláintecare 2025+).  Sláintecare 2025+ sets out an integrated and whole of system reform programme to be implemented over the period 2025–2027, recognising that some of these reforms will continue over a longer timeframe.  Sláintecare 2025+ comprises 23 individual Sláintecare Projects and the milestones to be achieved on the path to achieving universal healthcare across three priority areas:  • Improve access  • Improve service quality  • Increase capacity  Underpinning the delivery of Sláintecare projects across these three areas, are critical enabling reform programmes. These are designed to transform the delivery of health and social care services through digital transformation and innovation with an increased focus on achieving greater levels of productivity. The new HSE Health Regions is a particular enabling reform that will reorganise the overall health and social care service to one better aligned to meet the specific needs of the population.  Sláintecare 2025+ is designed to address challenges in the health service and builds on the progress made in implementing successive Programmes for Government and Sláintecare Implementation Strategies between 2018 and 2024. It is an ambitious and multifaceted programme designed to move Ireland towards a universal healthcare service. It has been developed following extensive stakeholder engagement and under the direction and oversight of the Sláintecare Programme Board.  Delivery of Sláintecare 2025+ is a core focus of the work of Department of Health and the HSE, and funding for Sláintecare is embedded within the overall Health Vote allocation, rather than being allocated a separate ring-fenced budget. The investment of €24.3 billion in Budget 2025 in Ireland’s Health and Social Care Services is the highest allocation of funding to the health service in the history of the state. The Government is fully committed to the continued delivery of Sláintecare reform and to the Sláintecare vision of a universal health and social care system where everyone has equitable access to services based on their need, and not on their ability to pay.  The Sláintecare Programme Board, established in 2021, is co-chaired by the Secretary-General of the Department of Health (DoH) and Chief Executive Officer of the Health Service Executive (HSE) and provides senior official interagency strategic leadership, oversight, and accountability for delivery of the Sláintecare reform programme. The Board ensures overall coherence in the design and delivery Sláintecare 2025+, the associated alignment of constituent programme elements and stakeholders.  The Sláintecare Implementation Progress Report 2024 was published last month. It shows that the reform measures taken so far are making a positive impact on patient’s lives.

This measure significantly reduced reliance on paper, streamlined administrative processes, and improved patient access to medications.  Building on this success, the national ePrescribing system is being developed as part of the wider ePharmacy programme and is being delivered under the remit of the Health Service Executive (HSE). The programme is established, an ePrescribing project team is in place, being led by experienced pharmacists and supported by the technology team.  In an important milestone on our way to digitised patient records under Digital for Care, in May 2025, the HSE published the tender for the delivery of a National Electronic Prescribing (NEP) service. This will lead to a shortlisting of potential vendors for the national ePrescribing solution in July 2025 with a competitive dialogue procurement process undertaken by the HSE to follow.  The National Electronic Prescription Service will be a secure, efficient, and fully integrated digital service for the transmission and storage of electronic prescriptions and electronic dispensations generated for patients in ambulatory care in both public and private settings across Ireland’s health service.  It will enable accurate, timely access to medication information, which will empower patients and improve overall patient care and pharmacy efficiency by enhancing clinical decision-making, reducing medication errors, and streamlining clinical workflows.

This will lead to a shortlisting of potential vendors for the national ePrescribing solution in July 2025 with a competitive dialogue procurement process undertaken by the HSE to follow.  The National Electronic Prescription Service will be a secure, efficient, and fully integrated digital service for the transmission and storage of electronic prescriptions and electronic dispensations generated for patients in ambulatory care in both public and private settings across Ireland’s health service.  It will enable accurate, timely access to medication information, which will empower patients and improve overall patient care and pharmacy efficiency by enhancing clinical decision-making, reducing medication errors, and streamlining clinical workflows.  This service will provide a critical piece of information for digital health records and the data from this service (prescription and dispensing data) will be available to patients and healthcare workers through the HSE Health App and the National Shared Care Record in the future.",
        "formatted_question": "What updates are available on the implementation of electronic prescriptions? What is their expected impact on patient care and pharmacy efficiency? Please provide a statement on the matter.",
        "formatted_answer": "The Department of Health introduced legislative changes during the COVID-19 pandemic to enable electronic prescriptions via Healthmail, allowing GPs to send prescriptions directly to patients' pharmacies. This reduced paper reliance and streamlined administrative processes. The national ePrescribing system is part of the ePharmacy programme, managed by the HSE. Key milestones include a tender publication in May 2025 and vendor shortlisting in July 2025. The National Electronic Prescription Service will securely transmit and store prescriptions, enhancing patient care and efficiency by reducing errors and improving workflows. This service will integrate with digital health records and the HSE Health App."
