In October 2022, the Higher Education Authority (HEA) ran an expression of interest (EOI) process seeking responses from Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) interested in building capacity in Dentistry, Pharmacy, Medicine, Nursing, and Veterinary Medicine.

At full roll out it is anticipated this will provide a further 78 student places per annum between both Universities, 48 of which will be available in the University of Galway Programme.  The Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science currently provides a subsidy, via the HEA, to HEIs towards the cost of Graduate Entry Medicine (GEM) provision for EU student places.

They went beyond the call of duty, working in front-line environments, treating COVID-19 positive patients, particularly in the early days when the control measures that we now take for granted were not yet in place.  In response to this, a Temporary Special Scheme was put in place for 12 months in July 2022 to support eligible staff who were impacted by Long-COVID in the public health sector.  The intention of this scheme was to support those employees working in COVID-19 environments in the time before PPE and vaccinations were readily available.  It is my understanding that there are approximately 159 employees currently on the Special Scheme, the majority of whom have been supported on full pay for almost 5 years now.  My Department has always worked hard to ensure supports have been in place for those workers impacted by long-COVID, and at our request, the Department of Public Expenditure, Infrastructure, Public Service Reform and Digitalisation (DPER), have agreed to extend the scheme on four occasions already, most recently at the end of June 2024 when it was extended for a further 12 months for the existing cohort of employees already being supported by it.  However, I understand DPER have been clear that this is the final extension that would be granted, and as such, the Special Scheme will conclude on 30th June 2025.  I would like to re-assure those 159 employees who have been supported by the scheme for up to 5 years now, that they will continue to be supported, and the full provisions of the Public Service Sick Leave Scheme will apply for anyone who remains unable to return to work.  The sick leave scheme provides:  - Full pay for three months.  - Half pay for three months, followed by:  - Temporary Rehabilitative Remuneration (TRR) can provide up to a further 547 days of paid leave.  - The Critical Illness Protocol that forms part of the sick leave scheme may also provide additional supports for up to 3 years.  I am aware that concerns have been raised by a number of unions about the scheme ending, and I know that the matter was before the Labour Court again on the 11th  of June 2025. The findings from this Court hearing are currently awaited.  I am also aware that the Minister for Social Protection has reviewed the EU recommendation in respect of the recognition of COVID-19 (not long-COVID) as an occupational illness, and I understand that following this review it was determined that COVID-19 did not meet the requirements to be recognised as an occupational illness in the context of the Occupational Injuries Benefit Scheme and the Social Welfare Consolidation Act.

        "answerText": " Minister for Health  The HSE has statutory responsibility for decisions on pricing and reimbursement of medicines under the community drugs schemes, in accordance with the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013. Therefore, I have asked the HSE to provide an update in relation to treatments for SMA patients over 18 years of age.  The HSE has advised that once a medicine is approved by the European Medicines Agency, the HSE is dependent on a pharmaceutical company making an application to Ireland for its drug or new indication to be assessed for reimbursement. All medicines are considered for pricing of reimbursement in order of application.  While many companies engage proactively with the HSE, Ireland, by virtue of its size and market share, may not always be prioritised by some companies in the first stages of marketing a new medicine. Reports describing timelines for reimbursement from EMA approval to HSE reimbursement approval do not consider this important factor, as statutorily the HSE are not able to add a new medicine to the reimbursement list until an application is received.  The HSE has advised that it is committed to providing access to as many medicines as possible, in as timely a fashion as possible, from the resources available (provided) to it.  The HSE must robustly assess applications for pricing and reimbursement to make sure that it can stretch available resources as far as possible and to deliver the best value in relation to each medicine and ultimately more medicines to Irish citizens and patients. HSE decisions on which medicines are reimbursed by the taxpayer are made on objective, scientific and economic grounds. There are formal processes which govern applications for the pricing and reimbursement of medicines, and new uses of existing medicines, to be funded and / or reimbursed.  In terms of the specific details of the application for pricing and reimbursement of risdiplam (Evrysdi®):  Reimbursement approval is in place for risdiplam (Evrysdi®) for the treatment of 5q spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) under the High Tech arrangements from the 1st September 2023. Reimbursement support is for a subgroup of the licensed indication.  As a condition of reimbursement, an individual patient approval system has been put in place by the HSE, to enable reimbursement for patients who meet the predefined criteria as per a HSE devised managed access protocol.  If the manufacturer of Risdiplam(Evrysdi® (Roche) submits a de novo application for adult patients with a clinical diagnosis of SMA Type 1, Type 2 or Type 3, that application will be duly progressed through the formal processes governing the pricing and reimbursement of medicines.  In terms of the specific details of the application for pricing and reimbursement of onasemnogene abeparvovec (Zolgensma®):  In October 2021, onasemnogene abeparvovec (Zolgensma®) was approved for reimbursement in Ireland following joint assessment and negotiations under the Beneluxa initiative for the treatment of patients with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) with a bi-allelic mutation in the SMN1 gene and a clinical diagnosis of SMA type 1, or pre-symptomatic patients with 5q SMA with a bi-allelic mutation in the SMN1 gene and up to 3 copies of the SMN2 gene.  As a condition of reimbursement, an individual patient approval system has been put in place by the HSE, to enable reimbursement for patients who meet the pre-defined criteria as per a HSE devised managed access protocol.  www.hse.ie/eng/about/who/cspd/medicines-management/managed-access-protocols/onasemnogene-abeparvovec-zolgensma/managed-access-protocol-onasemnogene-abeparvovec-zolgensma.pdf  In terms of the specific details of the application for pricing and reimbursement of nusinersen (Spinraza®) for adult patients (>18 years):  The HSE approved funding of nusinersen (Spinraza®) effective 1st July 2019 for the treatment of 5q Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) Type I, Type II and Type III in children under 18 years.  The HSE received a further application for pricing and reimbursement of nusinersen (Spinraza®) on the 17th September 2020 from Biogen (the applicant) indicated for the treatment of 5q Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) in adult patients (greater than18 years).  The first step in the process is the submission of a Rapid Review dossier (a clinical and economic dossier) to the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics (NCPE) for assessment. The HSE commissioned the Rapid Review process on the 28th September 2020.  The NCPE Rapid Review assessment report was received by the HSE on the 29th October 2020. The NCPE advised the HSE that a full Health Technology Assessment (HTA) was recommended for nusinersen (Spinraza®) to assess the clinical and cost-effectiveness compared to the current standard of care for adult patients (greater than18 years).  www.ncpe.ie/nusinersen-spinraza-hta-id-20044/  The HSE commissioned a full Health Technology Assessment on the 9th November 2020 as per agreed processes.  The HSE Corporate Pharmaceutical Unit (CPU) is the interface between the HSE and the Pharmaceutical Industry in relation to medicine pricing and reimbursement applications. The CPU met with Biogen regarding their application for Nusinersen (Spinraza®).  The Drugs Group is the national committee which the HSE has in place to make recommendations on the pricing and reimbursement of medicines. The membership of the HSE Drugs Group includes public interest members. The pharmacoeconomic report will be reviewed by the HSE Drugs Group along with the outputs of commercial negotiations, and any patient group submission(s) received. The HSE Drugs Group will consider all of the evidence and make a recommendation to the HSE Senior Leadership Team.  The decision-making authority in the HSE is the HSE Senior Leadership Team. The HSE Senior Leadership Team decides on the basis of all the demands it is faced with (across all services) whether it can fund a new medicine, or new use of an existing medicine, from the resources that have been provided to it in line with the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013.  A completed HTA is required from the applicant (Biogen) to progress this application, as per the formal processes governing the pricing and reimbursement of medicines. In the absence of a completed HTA the pricing and reimbursement application cannot progress.  The application remains under consideration with the HSE. The HSE cannot make any comment on possible outcomes from the ongoing assessment processes.   ",

        "answerText": " The Taoiseach  I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 9, inclusive, together.  On 4 April, I chaired the first plenary meeting of the Labour Employer Economic Forum since the formation of the new Government. The LEEF is made up of representatives from the Government, employers and trade unions and provides for tripartite dialogue on economic and employment issues as they affect the labour market. The meeting discussed the latest economic and trade developments, in particular the challenges arising from the US decision to impose tariffs on imports from the European Union. The meeting was also briefed on the potential to strengthen the all-island labour market for the benefit of employers and workers on the entire island. There were also updates on preparation of Ireland's action plan on the promotion of collective bargaining, on a number of broader labour market policy developments, and on remote and blended working policies. Finally, the meeting agreed to finalise a work programme for the LEEF for the period ahead and to re-establish a number of subgroups.  Alongside plenary meetings, the LEEF also meets in subgroup format, chaired by the relevant Minister. The recent plenary agreed to re-establishment of the following subgroups: enterprise and employment, chaired by the Minister for Enterprise, Tourism and Employment; apprenticeships, chaired by the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science; early years, chaired by the Minister for Children, Disability and Equality; and pensions, chaired by the Minister for Social Protection. A shared island working group, chaired at official level, has also been re-established.  It was also agreed to re-establish subgroups on health and on housing, following further engagement with relevant Departments and LEEF partners on their respective agendas.  The date of the next meeting of the LEEF plenary has not yet been scheduled. \n Deputy Paul McAuliffe  The Labour Employer Economic Forum is an important opportunity for members of the trade union movement to make representations to the Government with regard to the labour market and the issues which impact it. Legislation has been put forward in this House with regard to the rights of pensioners, particularly pensioners of many State bodies, who after retiring have very little input into the changes to the pension scheme which may impact them. In some cases that relates to increases that may or may not be due, but also we have seen in other sectors changes to the very nature of the scheme itself. Under the auspices of the Labour Employer Economic Forum and the relationship he has with the trade union movement, will the Taoiseach examine ways that pensioners who have retired might have a greater input into the pension schemes which they have paid into over many years? \n Deputy Paul Murphy  The number one issue facing many workers is housing, and the Government has repeatedly claimed both that it will both deliver new social homes and that the planning system is to blame for the lack of delivery so far. This month, however, funding for the delivery of almost 500 social homes has gone up in smoke. Almost 3,500 planned social homes, many with full planning permission, are in jeopardy now facing cost reviews. That is almost a third of the annual social housing delivery target. These public-private partnership deals have collapsed for one reason: private profit. The Government has claimed that the costs are now too high, but we knew they would be. They explicity include provision for the developers to make a profit from the arrangement. Every cent of profit is a cost in excess of what is actually necessary to deliver housing. In light of the collapse of PPP bundle 3 and the reviews of bundles 4 to 7, will the Taoiseach finally abandon the failed policy of public-private partnership and fund councils to deliver bundle 3 as soon as possible? \n Deputy Ruth Coppinger  I want to raise with the Taoiseach the issue of union busting and anti-union tactics by companies which are in receipt of huge State contracts and whether he thinks that is acceptable. One of the companies is one of the largest mechanical contractors in the State, Jones Engineering, which has a contract for the national children's hospital and potentially other State contracts.  It has consistently been hostile to members joining the union of their choice, Unite, so much so that it has attached three senior shop stewards to High Court proceedings, subjecting them, potentially, to huge costs and damages. People have also been subjected to unsolicited visits from people knocking on their doors and so on. Does the Taoiseach think these kinds of union-busting tactics are acceptable? Does he not think people working for companies doing State contracts should be entitled to join unions like Unite? Will he make a strong statement on the matter in relation to Jones Engineering? \n Deputy Conor D. McGuinness  The people of Waterford are being failed by this Government when it comes to jobs and investment. In the past five years, Waterford has received just a third of the number of IDA visits to Galway, Cork and Limerick. Even counties like Westmeath and Clare are getting more attention than Waterford. This is shown in the figures. Last year, Waterford gained just two new IDA-supported jobs. Over the past two decades, Cork averaged nearly 1,400 jobs created a year through the IDA, Galway 600, Limerick 300 and Waterford just 92. These figures come directly from replies to parliamentary questions I received this week. It is clear we are not seeing balanced regional development in the south east and Waterford; it is neglect. Will the Taoiseach finally admit the IDA strategy is failing in Waterford? Will he outline the steps that he, as Taoiseach and Head of Government, will take to address this imbalance? \n Deputy Shane Moynihan  We have often discussed the importance of policymakers recognising the effort and energy that goes into running a business and sustaining high levels of employment. The plight of SMEs in particular has been raised on the floor of the Dáil, as has the need for policies to make sure we encourage and incentivise SMEs to scale up to be able to pursue research and innovation for their own benefit and for upskilling their wider workforce.  I also raise the importance of the all-island labour market. It was discussed at the recent meeting of the LEEF and the ESRI also conducted a study recently on it. Will the Taoiseach share his thoughts on how the Government intends to deal with the potential and real divergence in employment standards between the UK and the European Union that will manifest on the Border, in particular for smaller employers trying to employ people who may live on the other side of the Border? There are differing expectations regarding flexible and remote working. How can those expectations be aligned? Has work been done at North-South Ministerial Council level and in direct relationship with the Northern Ireland Executive? \n Deputy Tony McCormack  I thank the Taoiseach for his update and welcome the reconvening of the Labour Employer Economic Forum under his chairmanship. It is clear the forum plays a vital role in bringing Government, employers and unions together, especially in times of uncertainty. As someone who engages regularly with small business owners and retailers across the country and in my county, Offaly, I welcome the recognition of the need to support sectors most exposed to global pressures. SMEs and retail businesses in our towns are the heart of our local economies. They create jobs, drive community life and have shown remarkable resilience in recent years. I am encouraged by the Taoiseach's commitment to ongoing dialogue. I ask that the specific needs of SMEs, especially in areas like staffing, digital transformation and access to supports, remain front and centre in the LEEF's upcoming work programme. This collaborative approach is the right one. I look forward to seeing practical outcomes that will make a real difference to businesses on the ground. \n Deputy Albert Dolan  I appreciate the update on the Labour Employer Economic Forum. I wish to ask about a separate matter regarding multiple schools in my constituency which have been in contact with me in the past week. In Castlehackett, Esker, Annagh Hill, St. Oliver's special education school and Peterswell, national schools spread right across Galway East have raised significant concerns with me around SNA allocations and reviews. A lot of the schools have had reviews and were recommended more SNA support. They have identified needs coming in in September. Is there a plan to ensure these schools are catered to come September? \n Deputy Ruairí Ó Murchú  I back up the comments of Deputy Moynihan. I have brought up previously with the Taoiseach the tax implications of remote working for companies and the impact that has on employees. Action needs to be taken to deal with that. On tariffs and engagement with unions and employers, what are the major issues and worries about what is coming down the line? What does the Government propose? What are the asks? I would like to think the Taoiseach is working alongside the Minister to deal with the apprenticeship issue. There is a fear regarding ETB settings that there will be a delay because of the shortfall in funding. There is a big hole of €40 million to €50 million. I submitted a Topical Issue with Deputy Cullinane about this. It needs to be on the agenda. There can be no delay.  I hope the Taoiseach is aware of the issue regarding the army pensions Act, which needs to updated. \n The Taoiseach  The question is about the LEEF. \n Deputy Ruairí Ó Murchú  I know. This relates to Michael McNeela, who was killed in 1989 on peacekeeping duties. \n An Ceann Comhairle  Time is up, Deputy. \n Deputy Ruairí Ó Murchú  His father was not able to receive the pension after the mother of Michael McNeela died. \n An Ceann Comhairle  Thank you, Deputy. Your time is up. \n Deputy Ruairí Ó Murchú  It is with the Tánaiste at the minute. He seems supportive----- \n An Ceann Comhairle  Deputy, please. \n Deputy Ruairí Ó Murchú  I would like to think the Taoiseach would also be and that this could be delivered. \n The Taoiseach  I think Deputy McAuliffe was the first contributor. He raised pensions and pensioners' input into their pension issues. It has been an ongoing concern for pensioners generally across the economy, particularly for public sector pensioners or those in agencies and so forth. There is a sense that once they leave employment, they lack any real influence over their pensions in the future. I will raise that issue with the Minister for public expenditure, who governs pensions within the public service, and the Minister for Social Protection. There is a pensions ombudsman. A lot of frameworks that were not there in times past can help pensioners to access details about their pensions. It is a growing issue. Recently, the CIÉ pensions issue was resolved through good negotiations and the involvement of unions. That illustrates the degree to which unions can play a constructive role on behalf of workers in respect of their pensions.  Deputy Murphy raised the PPPs. I presume and draw from my conclusions that he supports the decision not to go ahead with PPPs that were too expensive in terms of the cost per house. That is the decision the Minister for housing took when he looked at the figures that came in after tender. They were excessive and could not be justified at that stage.  Deputy Coppinger raised an issue. I cannot comment on any specific company. In Ireland, we are working through the LEEF on a collective bargaining action plan. The directive on adequate minimum wages in the European Union was published in 2022. It was transposed by Ireland by 15 November 2024. Under Article 4, the directive aims to promote collective bargaining on wages in all member states. In addition, each member state with a collective bargaining coverage rate below a threshold of 80%, as in Ireland, shall provide a framework of enabling conditions for collective bargaining and establish an action plan to promote collective bargaining. A technical group was established with the Department of enterprise and social partners in 2023 to consider the possible content of Ireland's action plan. A public consultation was also held on the content of the action plan. That closed in May this year. The Department is now reviewing submissions. They will help to guide the finalisation of proposals, both legislative and administrative, which may be considered for inclusion in Ireland's action plan. It will be published by the end of 2025 in line with the requirements of the EU directive.  Deputy McGuinness raised the question of investment in Waterford. I have to disagree; I think there has been significant investment in Waterford over the past five years in particular. There is now a university in the south east, with a strong campus in Waterford benefiting from significant investment. Waterford University Hospital, likewise, has benefited from significant investment. The North Quays project in the urban regeneration and development fund has been a significant investment. On FDI, the IDA is focused on Waterford. Some good companies have located there, across life sciences and financial services, which is positive. You cannot just go on one year because in some years there could be a significant increase and in others there can be a lapse. An individual company could have a decline. \n Deputy Conor D. McGuinness  The trend is over 20 years. \n The Taoiseach  There is going to be a flow and a fluidity in this from year to year, but the overall picture of investment in the south east and in Waterford has been positive and will continue to be in terms of Government commitment to the county.  Deputy Moynihan raised the very important issue of SMEs, and that is covered by the LEEF. Divergence in employment standards and taxation issues between North and South were mentioned. We have more work to do under the shared island aegis in the context of cross-Border workers. The Minister for Finance has been engaging with the Minister for Finance in the Executive. The taxation issues are thorny and complex because they also relate to how cross-border taxation is dealt with in the European Union itself. It is a growing issue since the onset of remote working. Deputy Ó Murchú raised this as well. It is a continuing issue. The Minister for Finance is focused on it. It is something LEEF is concerned about. Supply chains are becoming more seamless between North and South and in some sectors like dairy and energy it is a seamless market or a continuum of trade and so on. It is therefore important we try to get some position that is advantageous to workers, but we do not necessarily want to distort the economy of either jurisdiction, especially the North, in terms of its labour force.  Deputy Dolan raised schools. Schools do not get considered by the LEEF. SNA allocations will obviously have to be fed through the National Council for Special Education, which makes recommendations. On the allocation of SNAs, the numbers have grown exponentially and there are about 20,000 SNAs in the system. I will alert the Minister for education to the Deputy's raising of these issues.  Deputy Ó Murchú raised the tariff and the Army pensions. Again, I will relay that to the Tánaiste. I dealt with remote working. The LEEF has considered that. It is very conscious of the potential implications of tariffs on trade for employment. We have urged that we avoid a knee-jerk reaction. People were immediately looking for subsidies, which would have been the wrong thing because that situation has not unfolded yet. A lot depends on the nature of the trade deal between the European Union and the United States. I hope they reach a headline agreement before 8 July. I am hopeful they will and that the landing zone is one we can all live with, although it will be challenging and difficult for many companies, such as those in agrifood and general exports into the US. If there is a minimum floor of a tariff, that could be challenging for companies, so we will assess it in the round in terms of how we deal with it. ",

        "extracted_answer": "The Taoiseach  I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 9, inclusive, together.  On 4 April, I chaired the first plenary meeting of the Labour Employer Economic Forum since the formation of the new Government. The LEEF is made up of representatives from the Government, employers and trade unions and provides for tripartite dialogue on economic and employment issues as they affect the labour market. The meeting discussed the latest economic and trade developments, in particular the challenges arising from the US decision to impose tariffs on imports from the European Union. The meeting was also briefed on the potential to strengthen the all-island labour market for the benefit of employers and workers on the entire island. There were also updates on preparation of Ireland's action plan on the promotion of collective bargaining, on a number of broader labour market policy developments, and on remote and blended working policies. Finally, the meeting agreed to finalise a work programme for the LEEF for the period ahead and to re-establish a number of subgroups.  Alongside plenary meetings, the LEEF also meets in subgroup format, chaired by the relevant Minister. The recent plenary agreed to re-establishment of the following subgroups: enterprise and employment, chaired by the Minister for Enterprise, Tourism and Employment; apprenticeships, chaired by the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science; early years, chaired by the Minister for Children, Disability and Equality; and pensions, chaired by the Minister for Social Protection. A shared island working group, chaired at official level, has also been re-established.  It was also agreed to re-establish subgroups on health and on housing, following further engagement with relevant Departments and LEEF partners on their respective agendas.  The date of the next meeting of the LEEF plenary has not yet been scheduled. \n Deputy Paul McAuliffe  The Labour Employer Economic Forum is an important opportunity for members of the trade union movement to make representations to the Government with regard to the labour market and the issues which impact it. Legislation has been put forward in this House with regard to the rights of pensioners, particularly pensioners of many State bodies, who after retiring have very little input into the changes to the pension scheme which may impact them. In some cases that relates to increases that may or may not be due, but also we have seen in other sectors changes to the very nature of the scheme itself. Under the auspices of the Labour Employer Economic Forum and the relationship he has with the trade union movement, will the Taoiseach examine ways that pensioners who have retired might have a greater input into the pension schemes which they have paid into over many years? \n Deputy Paul Murphy  The number one issue facing many workers is housing, and the Government has repeatedly claimed both that it will both deliver new social homes and that the planning system is to blame for the lack of delivery so far. This month, however, funding for the delivery of almost 500 social homes has gone up in smoke. Almost 3,500 planned social homes, many with full planning permission, are in jeopardy now facing cost reviews. That is almost a third of the annual social housing delivery target. These public-private partnership deals have collapsed for one reason: private profit. The Government has claimed that the costs are now too high, but we knew they would be.

In light of the collapse of PPP bundle 3 and the reviews of bundles 4 to 7, will the Taoiseach finally abandon the failed policy of public-private partnership and fund councils to deliver bundle 3 as soon as possible? \n Deputy Ruth Coppinger  I want to raise with the Taoiseach the issue of union busting and anti-union tactics by companies which are in receipt of huge State contracts and whether he thinks that is acceptable. One of the companies is one of the largest mechanical contractors in the State, Jones Engineering, which has a contract for the national children's hospital and potentially other State contracts.  It has consistently been hostile to members joining the union of their choice, Unite, so much so that it has attached three senior shop stewards to High Court proceedings, subjecting them, potentially, to huge costs and damages. People have also been subjected to unsolicited visits from people knocking on their doors and so on. Does the Taoiseach think these kinds of union-busting tactics are acceptable? Does he not think people working for companies doing State contracts should be entitled to join unions like Unite? Will he make a strong statement on the matter in relation to Jones Engineering? \n Deputy Conor D. McGuinness  The people of Waterford are being failed by this Government when it comes to jobs and investment. In the past five years, Waterford has received just a third of the number of IDA visits to Galway, Cork and Limerick. Even counties like Westmeath and Clare are getting more attention than Waterford. This is shown in the figures. Last year, Waterford gained just two new IDA-supported jobs. Over the past two decades, Cork averaged nearly 1,400 jobs created a year through the IDA, Galway 600, Limerick 300 and Waterford just 92. These figures come directly from replies to parliamentary questions I received this week. It is clear we are not seeing balanced regional development in the south east and Waterford; it is neglect. Will the Taoiseach finally admit the IDA strategy is failing in Waterford? Will he outline the steps that he, as Taoiseach and Head of Government, will take to address this imbalance? \n Deputy Shane Moynihan  We have often discussed the importance of policymakers recognising the effort and energy that goes into running a business and sustaining high levels of employment. The plight of SMEs in particular has been raised on the floor of the Dáil, as has the need for policies to make sure we encourage and incentivise SMEs to scale up to be able to pursue research and innovation for their own benefit and for upskilling their wider workforce.  I also raise the importance of the all-island labour market. It was discussed at the recent meeting of the LEEF and the ESRI also conducted a study recently on it. Will the Taoiseach share his thoughts on how the Government intends to deal with the potential and real divergence in employment standards between the UK and the European Union that will manifest on the Border, in particular for smaller employers trying to employ people who may live on the other side of the Border? There are differing expectations regarding flexible and remote working. How can those expectations be aligned? Has work been done at North-South Ministerial Council level and in direct relationship with the Northern Ireland Executive? \n Deputy Tony McCormack  I thank the Taoiseach for his update and welcome the reconvening of the Labour Employer Economic Forum under his chairmanship. It is clear the forum plays a vital role in bringing Government, employers and unions together, especially in times of uncertainty. As someone who engages regularly with small business owners and retailers across the country and in my county, Offaly, I welcome the recognition of the need to support sectors most exposed to global pressures. SMEs and retail businesses in our towns are the heart of our local economies. They create jobs, drive community life and have shown remarkable resilience in recent years. I am encouraged by the Taoiseach's commitment to ongoing dialogue. I ask that the specific needs of SMEs, especially in areas like staffing, digital transformation and access to supports, remain front and centre in the LEEF's upcoming work programme. This collaborative approach is the right one. I look forward to seeing practical outcomes that will make a real difference to businesses on the ground. \n Deputy Albert Dolan  I appreciate the update on the Labour Employer Economic Forum. I wish to ask about a separate matter regarding multiple schools in my constituency which have been in contact with me in the past week. In Castlehackett, Esker, Annagh Hill, St. Oliver's special education school and Peterswell, national schools spread right across Galway East have raised significant concerns with me around SNA allocations and reviews. A lot of the schools have had reviews and were recommended more SNA support. They have identified needs coming in in September. Is there a plan to ensure these schools are catered to come September? \n Deputy Ruairí Ó Murchú  I back up the comments of Deputy Moynihan. I have brought up previously with the Taoiseach the tax implications of remote working for companies and the impact that has on employees. Action needs to be taken to deal with that. On tariffs and engagement with unions and employers, what are the major issues and worries about what is coming down the line? What does the Government propose? What are the asks? I would like to think the Taoiseach is working alongside the Minister to deal with the apprenticeship issue. There is a fear regarding ETB settings that there will be a delay because of the shortfall in funding. There is a big hole of €40 million to €50 million. I submitted a Topical Issue with Deputy Cullinane about this. It needs to be on the agenda. There can be no delay.  I hope the Taoiseach is aware of the issue regarding the army pensions Act, which needs to updated. \n The Taoiseach  The question is about the LEEF. \n Deputy Ruairí Ó Murchú  I know. This relates to Michael McNeela, who was killed in 1989 on peacekeeping duties. \n An Ceann Comhairle  Time is up, Deputy. \n Deputy Ruairí Ó Murchú  His father was not able to receive the pension after the mother of Michael McNeela died. \n An Ceann Comhairle  Thank you, Deputy. Your time is up. \n Deputy Ruairí Ó Murchú  It is with the Tánaiste at the minute. He seems supportive----- \n An Ceann Comhairle  Deputy, please. \n Deputy Ruairí Ó Murchú  I would like to think the Taoiseach would also be and that this could be delivered. \n The Taoiseach  I think Deputy McAuliffe was the first contributor. He raised pensions and pensioners' input into their pension issues. It has been an ongoing concern for pensioners generally across the economy, particularly for public sector pensioners or those in agencies and so forth. There is a sense that once they leave employment, they lack any real influence over their pensions in the future. I will raise that issue with the Minister for public expenditure, who governs pensions within the public service, and the Minister for Social Protection. There is a pensions ombudsman. A lot of frameworks that were not there in times past can help pensioners to access details about their pensions. It is a growing issue. Recently, the CIÉ pensions issue was resolved through good negotiations and the involvement of unions. That illustrates the degree to which unions can play a constructive role on behalf of workers in respect of their pensions.  Deputy Murphy raised the PPPs. I presume and draw from my conclusions that he supports the decision not to go ahead with PPPs that were too expensive in terms of the cost per house. That is the decision the Minister for housing took when he looked at the figures that came in after tender. They were excessive and could not be justified at that stage.  Deputy Coppinger raised an issue. I cannot comment on any specific company. In Ireland, we are working through the LEEF on a collective bargaining action plan. The directive on adequate minimum wages in the European Union was published in 2022. It was transposed by Ireland by 15 November 2024. Under Article 4, the directive aims to promote collective bargaining on wages in all member states. In addition, each member state with a collective bargaining coverage rate below a threshold of 80%, as in Ireland, shall provide a framework of enabling conditions for collective bargaining and establish an action plan to promote collective bargaining. A technical group was established with the Department of enterprise and social partners in 2023 to consider the possible content of Ireland's action plan. A public consultation was also held on the content of the action plan. That closed in May this year. The Department is now reviewing submissions. They will help to guide the finalisation of proposals, both legislative and administrative, which may be considered for inclusion in Ireland's action plan. It will be published by the end of 2025 in line with the requirements of the EU directive.  Deputy McGuinness raised the question of investment in Waterford. I have to disagree; I think there has been significant investment in Waterford over the past five years in particular. There is now a university in the south east, with a strong campus in Waterford benefiting from significant investment. Waterford University Hospital, likewise, has benefited from significant investment. The North Quays project in the urban regeneration and development fund has been a significant investment. On FDI, the IDA is focused on Waterford. Some good companies have located there, across life sciences and financial services, which is positive. You cannot just go on one year because in some years there could be a significant increase and in others there can be a lapse. An individual company could have a decline. \n Deputy Conor D. McGuinness  The trend is over 20 years. \n The Taoiseach  There is going to be a flow and a fluidity in this from year to year, but the overall picture of investment in the south east and in Waterford has been positive and will continue to be in terms of Government commitment to the county.  Deputy Moynihan raised the very important issue of SMEs, and that is covered by the LEEF. Divergence in employment standards and taxation issues between North and South were mentioned. We have more work to do under the shared island aegis in the context of cross-Border workers. The Minister for Finance has been engaging with the Minister for Finance in the Executive. The taxation issues are thorny and complex because they also relate to how cross-border taxation is dealt with in the European Union itself. It is a growing issue since the onset of remote working. Deputy Ó Murchú raised this as well. It is a continuing issue. The Minister for Finance is focused on it. It is something LEEF is concerned about. Supply chains are becoming more seamless between North and South and in some sectors like dairy and energy it is a seamless market or a continuum of trade and so on. It is therefore important we try to get some position that is advantageous to workers, but we do not necessarily want to distort the economy of either jurisdiction, especially the North, in terms of its labour force.  Deputy Dolan raised schools. Schools do not get considered by the LEEF. SNA allocations will obviously have to be fed through the National Council for Special Education, which makes recommendations. On the allocation of SNAs, the numbers have grown exponentially and there are about 20,000 SNAs in the system. I will alert the Minister for education to the Deputy's raising of these issues.  Deputy Ó Murchú raised the tariff and the Army pensions. Again, I will relay that to the Tánaiste. I dealt with remote working. The LEEF has considered that. It is very conscious of the potential implications of tariffs on trade for employment. We have urged that we avoid a knee-jerk reaction. People were immediately looking for subsidies, which would have been the wrong thing because that situation has not unfolded yet. A lot depends on the nature of the trade deal between the European Union and the United States. I hope they reach a headline agreement before 8 July. I am hopeful they will and that the landing zone is one we can all live with, although it will be challenging and difficult for many companies, such as those in agrifood and general exports into the US. If there is a minimum floor of a tariff, that could be challenging for companies, so we will assess it in the round in terms of how we deal with it. ",

        "extracted_answer": "The Taoiseach  I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 9, inclusive, together.  On 4 April, I chaired the first plenary meeting of the Labour Employer Economic Forum since the formation of the new Government. The LEEF is made up of representatives from the Government, employers and trade unions and provides for tripartite dialogue on economic and employment issues as they affect the labour market. The meeting discussed the latest economic and trade developments, in particular the challenges arising from the US decision to impose tariffs on imports from the European Union. The meeting was also briefed on the potential to strengthen the all-island labour market for the benefit of employers and workers on the entire island. There were also updates on preparation of Ireland's action plan on the promotion of collective bargaining, on a number of broader labour market policy developments, and on remote and blended working policies. Finally, the meeting agreed to finalise a work programme for the LEEF for the period ahead and to re-establish a number of subgroups.  Alongside plenary meetings, the LEEF also meets in subgroup format, chaired by the relevant Minister. The recent plenary agreed to re-establishment of the following subgroups: enterprise and employment, chaired by the Minister for Enterprise, Tourism and Employment; apprenticeships, chaired by the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science; early years, chaired by the Minister for Children, Disability and Equality; and pensions, chaired by the Minister for Social Protection. A shared island working group, chaired at official level, has also been re-established.  It was also agreed to re-establish subgroups on health and on housing, following further engagement with relevant Departments and LEEF partners on their respective agendas.  The date of the next meeting of the LEEF plenary has not yet been scheduled. \n Deputy Paul McAuliffe  The Labour Employer Economic Forum is an important opportunity for members of the trade union movement to make representations to the Government with regard to the labour market and the issues which impact it. Legislation has been put forward in this House with regard to the rights of pensioners, particularly pensioners of many State bodies, who after retiring have very little input into the changes to the pension scheme which may impact them. In some cases that relates to increases that may or may not be due, but also we have seen in other sectors changes to the very nature of the scheme itself. Under the auspices of the Labour Employer Economic Forum and the relationship he has with the trade union movement, will the Taoiseach examine ways that pensioners who have retired might have a greater input into the pension schemes which they have paid into over many years? \n Deputy Paul Murphy  The number one issue facing many workers is housing, and the Government has repeatedly claimed both that it will both deliver new social homes and that the planning system is to blame for the lack of delivery so far. This month, however, funding for the delivery of almost 500 social homes has gone up in smoke. Almost 3,500 planned social homes, many with full planning permission, are in jeopardy now facing cost reviews. That is almost a third of the annual social housing delivery target. These public-private partnership deals have collapsed for one reason: private profit. The Government has claimed that the costs are now too high, but we knew they would be. They explicity include provision for the developers to make a profit from the arrangement. Every cent of profit is a cost in excess of what is actually necessary to deliver housing.

They explicity include provision for the developers to make a profit from the arrangement. Every cent of profit is a cost in excess of what is actually necessary to deliver housing. In light of the collapse of PPP bundle 3 and the reviews of bundles 4 to 7, will the Taoiseach finally abandon the failed policy of public-private partnership and fund councils to deliver bundle 3 as soon as possible? \n Deputy Ruth Coppinger  I want to raise with the Taoiseach the issue of union busting and anti-union tactics by companies which are in receipt of huge State contracts and whether he thinks that is acceptable. One of the companies is one of the largest mechanical contractors in the State, Jones Engineering, which has a contract for the national children's hospital and potentially other State contracts.  It has consistently been hostile to members joining the union of their choice, Unite, so much so that it has attached three senior shop stewards to High Court proceedings, subjecting them, potentially, to huge costs and damages. People have also been subjected to unsolicited visits from people knocking on their doors and so on. Does the Taoiseach think these kinds of union-busting tactics are acceptable? Does he not think people working for companies doing State contracts should be entitled to join unions like Unite? Will he make a strong statement on the matter in relation to Jones Engineering? \n Deputy Conor D. McGuinness  The people of Waterford are being failed by this Government when it comes to jobs and investment. In the past five years, Waterford has received just a third of the number of IDA visits to Galway, Cork and Limerick. Even counties like Westmeath and Clare are getting more attention than Waterford. This is shown in the figures. Last year, Waterford gained just two new IDA-supported jobs. Over the past two decades, Cork averaged nearly 1,400 jobs created a year through the IDA, Galway 600, Limerick 300 and Waterford just 92. These figures come directly from replies to parliamentary questions I received this week. It is clear we are not seeing balanced regional development in the south east and Waterford; it is neglect. Will the Taoiseach finally admit the IDA strategy is failing in Waterford? Will he outline the steps that he, as Taoiseach and Head of Government, will take to address this imbalance? \n Deputy Shane Moynihan  We have often discussed the importance of policymakers recognising the effort and energy that goes into running a business and sustaining high levels of employment. The plight of SMEs in particular has been raised on the floor of the Dáil, as has the need for policies to make sure we encourage and incentivise SMEs to scale up to be able to pursue research and innovation for their own benefit and for upskilling their wider workforce.  I also raise the importance of the all-island labour market. It was discussed at the recent meeting of the LEEF and the ESRI also conducted a study recently on it. Will the Taoiseach share his thoughts on how the Government intends to deal with the potential and real divergence in employment standards between the UK and the European Union that will manifest on the Border, in particular for smaller employers trying to employ people who may live on the other side of the Border? There are differing expectations regarding flexible and remote working. How can those expectations be aligned? Has work been done at North-South Ministerial Council level and in direct relationship with the Northern Ireland Executive? \n Deputy Tony McCormack  I thank the Taoiseach for his update and welcome the reconvening of the Labour Employer Economic Forum under his chairmanship. It is clear the forum plays a vital role in bringing Government, employers and unions together, especially in times of uncertainty. As someone who engages regularly with small business owners and retailers across the country and in my county, Offaly, I welcome the recognition of the need to support sectors most exposed to global pressures. SMEs and retail businesses in our towns are the heart of our local economies. They create jobs, drive community life and have shown remarkable resilience in recent years. I am encouraged by the Taoiseach's commitment to ongoing dialogue. I ask that the specific needs of SMEs, especially in areas like staffing, digital transformation and access to supports, remain front and centre in the LEEF's upcoming work programme. This collaborative approach is the right one. I look forward to seeing practical outcomes that will make a real difference to businesses on the ground. \n Deputy Albert Dolan  I appreciate the update on the Labour Employer Economic Forum. I wish to ask about a separate matter regarding multiple schools in my constituency which have been in contact with me in the past week. In Castlehackett, Esker, Annagh Hill, St. Oliver's special education school and Peterswell, national schools spread right across Galway East have raised significant concerns with me around SNA allocations and reviews. A lot of the schools have had reviews and were recommended more SNA support. They have identified needs coming in in September. Is there a plan to ensure these schools are catered to come September? \n Deputy Ruairí Ó Murchú  I back up the comments of Deputy Moynihan. I have brought up previously with the Taoiseach the tax implications of remote working for companies and the impact that has on employees. Action needs to be taken to deal with that. On tariffs and engagement with unions and employers, what are the major issues and worries about what is coming down the line? What does the Government propose? What are the asks? I would like to think the Taoiseach is working alongside the Minister to deal with the apprenticeship issue. There is a fear regarding ETB settings that there will be a delay because of the shortfall in funding. There is a big hole of €40 million to €50 million. I submitted a Topical Issue with Deputy Cullinane about this. It needs to be on the agenda. There can be no delay.  I hope the Taoiseach is aware of the issue regarding the army pensions Act, which needs to updated. \n The Taoiseach  The question is about the LEEF. \n Deputy Ruairí Ó Murchú  I know. This relates to Michael McNeela, who was killed in 1989 on peacekeeping duties. \n An Ceann Comhairle  Time is up, Deputy. \n Deputy Ruairí Ó Murchú  His father was not able to receive the pension after the mother of Michael McNeela died. \n An Ceann Comhairle  Thank you, Deputy. Your time is up. \n Deputy Ruairí Ó Murchú  It is with the Tánaiste at the minute. He seems supportive----- \n An Ceann Comhairle  Deputy, please. \n Deputy Ruairí Ó Murchú  I would like to think the Taoiseach would also be and that this could be delivered. \n The Taoiseach  I think Deputy McAuliffe was the first contributor. He raised pensions and pensioners' input into their pension issues. It has been an ongoing concern for pensioners generally across the economy, particularly for public sector pensioners or those in agencies and so forth. There is a sense that once they leave employment, they lack any real influence over their pensions in the future. I will raise that issue with the Minister for public expenditure, who governs pensions within the public service, and the Minister for Social Protection. There is a pensions ombudsman. A lot of frameworks that were not there in times past can help pensioners to access details about their pensions. It is a growing issue. Recently, the CIÉ pensions issue was resolved through good negotiations and the involvement of unions. That illustrates the degree to which unions can play a constructive role on behalf of workers in respect of their pensions.  Deputy Murphy raised the PPPs. I presume and draw from my conclusions that he supports the decision not to go ahead with PPPs that were too expensive in terms of the cost per house. That is the decision the Minister for housing took when he looked at the figures that came in after tender. They were excessive and could not be justified at that stage.  Deputy Coppinger raised an issue. I cannot comment on any specific company. In Ireland, we are working through the LEEF on a collective bargaining action plan. The directive on adequate minimum wages in the European Union was published in 2022. It was transposed by Ireland by 15 November 2024. Under Article 4, the directive aims to promote collective bargaining on wages in all member states. In addition, each member state with a collective bargaining coverage rate below a threshold of 80%, as in Ireland, shall provide a framework of enabling conditions for collective bargaining and establish an action plan to promote collective bargaining. A technical group was established with the Department of enterprise and social partners in 2023 to consider the possible content of Ireland's action plan. A public consultation was also held on the content of the action plan. That closed in May this year. The Department is now reviewing submissions. They will help to guide the finalisation of proposals, both legislative and administrative, which may be considered for inclusion in Ireland's action plan. It will be published by the end of 2025 in line with the requirements of the EU directive.  Deputy McGuinness raised the question of investment in Waterford. I have to disagree; I think there has been significant investment in Waterford over the past five years in particular. There is now a university in the south east, with a strong campus in Waterford benefiting from significant investment. Waterford University Hospital, likewise, has benefited from significant investment. The North Quays project in the urban regeneration and development fund has been a significant investment. On FDI, the IDA is focused on Waterford. Some good companies have located there, across life sciences and financial services, which is positive. You cannot just go on one year because in some years there could be a significant increase and in others there can be a lapse. An individual company could have a decline. \n Deputy Conor D. McGuinness  The trend is over 20 years. \n The Taoiseach  There is going to be a flow and a fluidity in this from year to year, but the overall picture of investment in the south east and in Waterford has been positive and will continue to be in terms of Government commitment to the county.  Deputy Moynihan raised the very important issue of SMEs, and that is covered by the LEEF. Divergence in employment standards and taxation issues between North and South were mentioned. We have more work to do under the shared island aegis in the context of cross-Border workers. The Minister for Finance has been engaging with the Minister for Finance in the Executive. The taxation issues are thorny and complex because they also relate to how cross-border taxation is dealt with in the European Union itself. It is a growing issue since the onset of remote working. Deputy Ó Murchú raised this as well. It is a continuing issue. The Minister for Finance is focused on it. It is something LEEF is concerned about. Supply chains are becoming more seamless between North and South and in some sectors like dairy and energy it is a seamless market or a continuum of trade and so on. It is therefore important we try to get some position that is advantageous to workers, but we do not necessarily want to distort the economy of either jurisdiction, especially the North, in terms of its labour force.  Deputy Dolan raised schools. Schools do not get considered by the LEEF. SNA allocations will obviously have to be fed through the National Council for Special Education, which makes recommendations. On the allocation of SNAs, the numbers have grown exponentially and there are about 20,000 SNAs in the system. I will alert the Minister for education to the Deputy's raising of these issues.  Deputy Ó Murchú raised the tariff and the Army pensions. Again, I will relay that to the Tánaiste. I dealt with remote working. The LEEF has considered that. It is very conscious of the potential implications of tariffs on trade for employment. We have urged that we avoid a knee-jerk reaction. People were immediately looking for subsidies, which would have been the wrong thing because that situation has not unfolded yet. A lot depends on the nature of the trade deal between the European Union and the United States. I hope they reach a headline agreement before 8 July. I am hopeful they will and that the landing zone is one we can all live with, although it will be challenging and difficult for many companies, such as those in agrifood and general exports into the US. If there is a minimum floor of a tariff, that could be challenging for companies, so we will assess it in the round in terms of how we deal with it. ",

On 4 April, I chaired the first plenary meeting of the Labour Employer Economic Forum since the formation of the new Government. The LEEF is made up of representatives from the Government, employers and trade unions and provides for tripartite dialogue on economic and employment issues as they affect the labour market. The meeting discussed the latest economic and trade developments, in particular the challenges arising from the US decision to impose tariffs on imports from the European Union. The meeting was also briefed on the potential to strengthen the all-island labour market for the benefit of employers and workers on the entire island. There were also updates on preparation of Ireland's action plan on the promotion of collective bargaining, on a number of broader labour market policy developments, and on remote and blended working policies. Finally, the meeting agreed to finalise a work programme for the LEEF for the period ahead and to re-establish a number of subgroups.  Alongside plenary meetings, the LEEF also meets in subgroup format, chaired by the relevant Minister. The recent plenary agreed to re-establishment of the following subgroups: enterprise and employment, chaired by the Minister for Enterprise, Tourism and Employment; apprenticeships, chaired by the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science; early years, chaired by the Minister for Children, Disability and Equality; and pensions, chaired by the Minister for Social Protection. A shared island working group, chaired at official level, has also been re-established.  It was also agreed to re-establish subgroups on health and on housing, following further engagement with relevant Departments and LEEF partners on their respective agendas.  The date of the next meeting of the LEEF plenary has not yet been scheduled. \n Deputy Paul McAuliffe  The Labour Employer Economic Forum is an important opportunity for members of the trade union movement to make representations to the Government with regard to the labour market and the issues which impact it. Legislation has been put forward in this House with regard to the rights of pensioners, particularly pensioners of many State bodies, who after retiring have very little input into the changes to the pension scheme which may impact them.

They explicity include provision for the developers to make a profit from the arrangement. Every cent of profit is a cost in excess of what is actually necessary to deliver housing. In light of the collapse of PPP bundle 3 and the reviews of bundles 4 to 7, will the Taoiseach finally abandon the failed policy of public-private partnership and fund councils to deliver bundle 3 as soon as possible? \n Deputy Ruth Coppinger  I want to raise with the Taoiseach the issue of union busting and anti-union tactics by companies which are in receipt of huge State contracts and whether he thinks that is acceptable. One of the companies is one of the largest mechanical contractors in the State, Jones Engineering, which has a contract for the national children's hospital and potentially other State contracts.  It has consistently been hostile to members joining the union of their choice, Unite, so much so that it has attached three senior shop stewards to High Court proceedings, subjecting them, potentially, to huge costs and damages. People have also been subjected to unsolicited visits from people knocking on their doors and so on. Does the Taoiseach think these kinds of union-busting tactics are acceptable? Does he not think people working for companies doing State contracts should be entitled to join unions like Unite? Will he make a strong statement on the matter in relation to Jones Engineering? \n Deputy Conor D. McGuinness  The people of Waterford are being failed by this Government when it comes to jobs and investment. In the past five years, Waterford has received just a third of the number of IDA visits to Galway, Cork and Limerick. Even counties like Westmeath and Clare are getting more attention than Waterford. This is shown in the figures. Last year, Waterford gained just two new IDA-supported jobs. Over the past two decades, Cork averaged nearly 1,400 jobs created a year through the IDA, Galway 600, Limerick 300 and Waterford just 92. These figures come directly from replies to parliamentary questions I received this week. It is clear we are not seeing balanced regional development in the south east and Waterford; it is neglect. Will the Taoiseach finally admit the IDA strategy is failing in Waterford? Will he outline the steps that he, as Taoiseach and Head of Government, will take to address this imbalance? \n Deputy Shane Moynihan  We have often discussed the importance of policymakers recognising the effort and energy that goes into running a business and sustaining high levels of employment. The plight of SMEs in particular has been raised on the floor of the Dáil, as has the need for policies to make sure we encourage and incentivise SMEs to scale up to be able to pursue research and innovation for their own benefit and for upskilling their wider workforce.  I also raise the importance of the all-island labour market. It was discussed at the recent meeting of the LEEF and the ESRI also conducted a study recently on it. Will the Taoiseach share his thoughts on how the Government intends to deal with the potential and real divergence in employment standards between the UK and the European Union that will manifest on the Border, in particular for smaller employers trying to employ people who may live on the other side of the Border? There are differing expectations regarding flexible and remote working. How can those expectations be aligned? Has work been done at North-South Ministerial Council level and in direct relationship with the Northern Ireland Executive? \n Deputy Tony McCormack  I thank the Taoiseach for his update and welcome the reconvening of the Labour Employer Economic Forum under his chairmanship. It is clear the forum plays a vital role in bringing Government, employers and unions together, especially in times of uncertainty. As someone who engages regularly with small business owners and retailers across the country and in my county, Offaly, I welcome the recognition of the need to support sectors most exposed to global pressures. SMEs and retail businesses in our towns are the heart of our local economies. They create jobs, drive community life and have shown remarkable resilience in recent years. I am encouraged by the Taoiseach's commitment to ongoing dialogue. I ask that the specific needs of SMEs, especially in areas like staffing, digital transformation and access to supports, remain front and centre in the LEEF's upcoming work programme. This collaborative approach is the right one. I look forward to seeing practical outcomes that will make a real difference to businesses on the ground. \n Deputy Albert Dolan  I appreciate the update on the Labour Employer Economic Forum. I wish to ask about a separate matter regarding multiple schools in my constituency which have been in contact with me in the past week. In Castlehackett, Esker, Annagh Hill, St. Oliver's special education school and Peterswell, national schools spread right across Galway East have raised significant concerns with me around SNA allocations and reviews. A lot of the schools have had reviews and were recommended more SNA support. They have identified needs coming in in September. Is there a plan to ensure these schools are catered to come September? \n Deputy Ruairí Ó Murchú  I back up the comments of Deputy Moynihan. I have brought up previously with the Taoiseach the tax implications of remote working for companies and the impact that has on employees. Action needs to be taken to deal with that. On tariffs and engagement with unions and employers, what are the major issues and worries about what is coming down the line? What does the Government propose? What are the asks? I would like to think the Taoiseach is working alongside the Minister to deal with the apprenticeship issue. There is a fear regarding ETB settings that there will be a delay because of the shortfall in funding. There is a big hole of €40 million to €50 million. I submitted a Topical Issue with Deputy Cullinane about this. It needs to be on the agenda. There can be no delay.  I hope the Taoiseach is aware of the issue regarding the army pensions Act, which needs to updated. \n The Taoiseach  The question is about the LEEF. \n Deputy Ruairí Ó Murchú  I know. This relates to Michael McNeela, who was killed in 1989 on peacekeeping duties. \n An Ceann Comhairle  Time is up, Deputy. \n Deputy Ruairí Ó Murchú  His father was not able to receive the pension after the mother of Michael McNeela died. \n An Ceann Comhairle  Thank you, Deputy. Your time is up. \n Deputy Ruairí Ó Murchú  It is with the Tánaiste at the minute. He seems supportive----- \n An Ceann Comhairle  Deputy, please. \n Deputy Ruairí Ó Murchú  I would like to think the Taoiseach would also be and that this could be delivered. \n The Taoiseach  I think Deputy McAuliffe was the first contributor. He raised pensions and pensioners' input into their pension issues. It has been an ongoing concern for pensioners generally across the economy, particularly for public sector pensioners or those in agencies and so forth. There is a sense that once they leave employment, they lack any real influence over their pensions in the future. I will raise that issue with the Minister for public expenditure, who governs pensions within the public service, and the Minister for Social Protection. There is a pensions ombudsman. A lot of frameworks that were not there in times past can help pensioners to access details about their pensions. It is a growing issue. Recently, the CIÉ pensions issue was resolved through good negotiations and the involvement of unions. That illustrates the degree to which unions can play a constructive role on behalf of workers in respect of their pensions.  Deputy Murphy raised the PPPs. I presume and draw from my conclusions that he supports the decision not to go ahead with PPPs that were too expensive in terms of the cost per house. That is the decision the Minister for housing took when he looked at the figures that came in after tender. They were excessive and could not be justified at that stage.  Deputy Coppinger raised an issue. I cannot comment on any specific company. In Ireland, we are working through the LEEF on a collective bargaining action plan. The directive on adequate minimum wages in the European Union was published in 2022. It was transposed by Ireland by 15 November 2024. Under Article 4, the directive aims to promote collective bargaining on wages in all member states. In addition, each member state with a collective bargaining coverage rate below a threshold of 80%, as in Ireland, shall provide a framework of enabling conditions for collective bargaining and establish an action plan to promote collective bargaining. A technical group was established with the Department of enterprise and social partners in 2023 to consider the possible content of Ireland's action plan. A public consultation was also held on the content of the action plan. That closed in May this year. The Department is now reviewing submissions. They will help to guide the finalisation of proposals, both legislative and administrative, which may be considered for inclusion in Ireland's action plan. It will be published by the end of 2025 in line with the requirements of the EU directive.  Deputy McGuinness raised the question of investment in Waterford. I have to disagree; I think there has been significant investment in Waterford over the past five years in particular. There is now a university in the south east, with a strong campus in Waterford benefiting from significant investment. Waterford University Hospital, likewise, has benefited from significant investment. The North Quays project in the urban regeneration and development fund has been a significant investment. On FDI, the IDA is focused on Waterford. Some good companies have located there, across life sciences and financial services, which is positive. You cannot just go on one year because in some years there could be a significant increase and in others there can be a lapse. An individual company could have a decline. \n Deputy Conor D. McGuinness  The trend is over 20 years. \n The Taoiseach  There is going to be a flow and a fluidity in this from year to year, but the overall picture of investment in the south east and in Waterford has been positive and will continue to be in terms of Government commitment to the county.  Deputy Moynihan raised the very important issue of SMEs, and that is covered by the LEEF. Divergence in employment standards and taxation issues between North and South were mentioned. We have more work to do under the shared island aegis in the context of cross-Border workers. The Minister for Finance has been engaging with the Minister for Finance in the Executive. The taxation issues are thorny and complex because they also relate to how cross-border taxation is dealt with in the European Union itself. It is a growing issue since the onset of remote working. Deputy Ó Murchú raised this as well. It is a continuing issue. The Minister for Finance is focused on it. It is something LEEF is concerned about. Supply chains are becoming more seamless between North and South and in some sectors like dairy and energy it is a seamless market or a continuum of trade and so on. It is therefore important we try to get some position that is advantageous to workers, but we do not necessarily want to distort the economy of either jurisdiction, especially the North, in terms of its labour force.  Deputy Dolan raised schools. Schools do not get considered by the LEEF. SNA allocations will obviously have to be fed through the National Council for Special Education, which makes recommendations. On the allocation of SNAs, the numbers have grown exponentially and there are about 20,000 SNAs in the system. I will alert the Minister for education to the Deputy's raising of these issues.  Deputy Ó Murchú raised the tariff and the Army pensions. Again, I will relay that to the Tánaiste. I dealt with remote working. The LEEF has considered that. It is very conscious of the potential implications of tariffs on trade for employment. We have urged that we avoid a knee-jerk reaction. People were immediately looking for subsidies, which would have been the wrong thing because that situation has not unfolded yet. A lot depends on the nature of the trade deal between the European Union and the United States. I hope they reach a headline agreement before 8 July. I am hopeful they will and that the landing zone is one we can all live with, although it will be challenging and difficult for many companies, such as those in agrifood and general exports into the US. If there is a minimum floor of a tariff, that could be challenging for companies, so we will assess it in the round in terms of how we deal with it. ",

        "extracted_answer": "The Taoiseach  I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 9, inclusive, together.  On 4 April, I chaired the first plenary meeting of the Labour Employer Economic Forum since the formation of the new Government. The LEEF is made up of representatives from the Government, employers and trade unions and provides for tripartite dialogue on economic and employment issues as they affect the labour market. The meeting discussed the latest economic and trade developments, in particular the challenges arising from the US decision to impose tariffs on imports from the European Union. The meeting was also briefed on the potential to strengthen the all-island labour market for the benefit of employers and workers on the entire island. There were also updates on preparation of Ireland's action plan on the promotion of collective bargaining, on a number of broader labour market policy developments, and on remote and blended working policies. Finally, the meeting agreed to finalise a work programme for the LEEF for the period ahead and to re-establish a number of subgroups.  Alongside plenary meetings, the LEEF also meets in subgroup format, chaired by the relevant Minister. The recent plenary agreed to re-establishment of the following subgroups: enterprise and employment, chaired by the Minister for Enterprise, Tourism and Employment; apprenticeships, chaired by the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science; early years, chaired by the Minister for Children, Disability and Equality; and pensions, chaired by the Minister for Social Protection. A shared island working group, chaired at official level, has also been re-established.  It was also agreed to re-establish subgroups on health and on housing, following further engagement with relevant Departments and LEEF partners on their respective agendas.  The date of the next meeting of the LEEF plenary has not yet been scheduled. \n Deputy Paul McAuliffe  The Labour Employer Economic Forum is an important opportunity for members of the trade union movement to make representations to the Government with regard to the labour market and the issues which impact it. Legislation has been put forward in this House with regard to the rights of pensioners, particularly pensioners of many State bodies, who after retiring have very little input into the changes to the pension scheme which may impact them. In some cases that relates to increases that may or may not be due, but also we have seen in other sectors changes to the very nature of the scheme itself. Under the auspices of the Labour Employer Economic Forum and the relationship he has with the trade union movement, will the Taoiseach examine ways that pensioners who have retired might have a greater input into the pension schemes which they have paid into over many years? \n Deputy Paul Murphy  The number one issue facing many workers is housing, and the Government has repeatedly claimed both that it will both deliver new social homes and that the planning system is to blame for the lack of delivery so far. This month, however, funding for the delivery of almost 500 social homes has gone up in smoke. Almost 3,500 planned social homes, many with full planning permission, are in jeopardy now facing cost reviews. That is almost a third of the annual social housing delivery target. These public-private partnership deals have collapsed for one reason: private profit. The Government has claimed that the costs are now too high, but we knew they would be. They explicity include provision for the developers to make a profit from the arrangement. Every cent of profit is a cost in excess of what is actually necessary to deliver housing.

        "formatted_answer": "On 4 April 2025, a plenary meeting of the Labour Employer Economic Forum (LEEF) took place. The LEEF includes representatives from the Government, employers, and trade unions. The meeting addressed economic and employment issues, particularly the impact of US tariffs on EU imports, strategies to strengthen the all-island labor market, updates on Ireland's collective bargaining plan, and remote work policies. The participants agreed to establish a work program and several subgroups, including those focused on enterprise and employment, apprenticeships, early years, pensions, and a shared island working group. Additional subgroups on health and housing are expected to be formed after further discussions. The date for the next plenary meeting has not been determined."

        "answerText": " The Taoiseach  I propose to take Questions Nos. 10 to 20, inclusive, together.  The Cabinet committee on health last met on 4 June 2025 and is due to meet again on 17 July 2025. It oversees implementation of programme for Government commitments in relation to health, receives detailed reports on identified policy areas and considers health reforms, including Sláintecare and the reform of public health and health system preparedness for future health threats. It also receives reports on programme for Government commitments in the areas of mental health and drugs policy.  Path to Universal Healthcare: Sláintecare & Programme for Government 2025+, our latest Sláintecare strategy published last month, aims to forge the way towards accessible, affordable, high-quality, healthcare for the people when they need it and where they need it. We will continue to build our workforce through the recruitment of key roles, retention measures and additional college places for key disciplines. We have capacity to hire a further 6,105 whole-time equivalents, WTEs, to Department of Health-funded posts during the remainder of 2025. We will deliver faster access to care. Funding of €420 million has been allocated for the waiting list action plan 2025. We will continue to review capacity in emergency departments. We will increase the number of public-only consultants in emergency medicine and ensure more senior staff are rostered in emergency departments during weekends and public holidays for better decision-making. The construction of 297 new and replacement acute beds is expected to be completed in 2025. The surgical hub for south Dublin opened in February this year with additional hubs becoming operational later in 2025 and 2026. We will continue to invest in a healthier future with a national physical activity framework and action plan due to be published in 2025 and a new obesity policy and action plan to be published in 2026.  We are launching a new era of innovation and digital transformation in health. The national patient app has been rolled out, with additional features to be added later in the year. The national shared care record will be developed throughout the year and the electronic health record will also be progressed. Additional projects which are key to the increased digitalisation of the health service include a national system for electronic prescribing and remote health monitoring and virtual care solutions. In mental health we will continue to build the mental health workforce and infrastructure and support community-based services. In older people’s services we will support people to live at home within their communities and strengthen the nursing home sector. The welfare of residents is at the forefront of Government’s concerns. The forthcoming national policy on adult safeguarding for the health and social care sector, which is a programme for Government commitment, will set out how existing protections will be strengthened. This policy is near finalisation and will be brought to Government shortly.  All these commitments build on the investment and reforms undertaken over the past number of years, including the delivery of approximately 1,282 acute beds, an increased workforce of close to 30,000 since the start of 2020, more affordable healthcare through reductions in the drugs payment scheme threshold to €80, removal of hospital inpatient charges, extension of the eligibility for free GP cards for all children under eight and to all earning no more than the median income, State-funded IVF, free contraception for women aged 17 to 35 and free access to HRT therapies. From September 2021 to April 2025, there has been an almost 60% reduction in the number of people waiting longer than 12 months. Care is being delivered closer to home in 180 primary care centres through 96 community health networks, 27 community specialist teams for older persons and 26 community specialist teams for chronic disease are now operational. Some 23 community intervention teams are operational, with national coverage secured. The new regional structures within the HSE have been established with six new health regions and 20 integrated health areas. Health and social care services are planned and delivered around the specific needs of local populations and this leads to better co-ordination of care and access to services. We will continue to invest and reform. \n Deputy Marie Sherlock  The Cabinet today approved the patient safety (licensing) Bill. It is long-awaited legislation and one we very much welcome, but will there be minimum staffing numbers in that critical legislation? The INMO has been campaigning on this for a long time.  On cervical cancer, I hosted the 221+ group last week. We saw reports at the weekend that cervical screening is still failing women. Three women have died of cancer and seven more have a positive diagnosis after smear tests were allegedly negligently misread between 2018 and 2021. I ask the Taoiseach about CervicalCheck and the actions the Cabinet health committee is taking to ensure it can provide assurance we can all be confident in the work it is undertaking. \n Deputy Martin Daly  Would it be possible for the Minister for Health and her Department and the Government to reconsider their stance on the shingles vaccine given recent studies that show the administration of shingles vaccine in the elderly population has the added benefit of the reduction of the onset of dementia by about 20%? It is a significant additional piece of data published in Nature magazine and based on a study of the introduction of the vaccine in Wales. The shingles vaccine is now offered to all people aged over 60 in the UK, as well as in a number of other jurisdictions. This bit of data improves the cost-benefit analysis of the introduction of a shingles vaccine programme for elderly people. \n Deputy Darren O'Rourke  Last week, Children's Health Ireland confirmed just 105 appointments have been offered so far to the children potentially affected by the scandal of unnecessary hip surgeries. Only 60 people have been seen so far out of a total of 2,259 children who had hip surgery since 2010 at Children's Health Ireland or the National Orthopaedic Hospital, Cappagh. At this rate it will take more than 20 years for every child to be assessed.  To make matters worse, CHI has also confirmed that it is only conducting a once-off review to assess complications only and determine current clinical state. That means it will not provide answers to the 2,259 families on the question of whether their child's surgery was necessary in the first place. It will not provide answers to the question of whether those children were harmed or wronged by malpractice. There will be no transparency, no honesty and no accountability. Will the Government ensure that Children's Health Ireland gets to the real facts for these children and tells them straight whether their surgery was necessary? \n Deputy Ruth Coppinger  On the issue of children's health in this country, the Taoiseach gave a glowing introduction, but we have the ongoing scandals at CHI. The latest is no disclosure to parents of the failure of CHI to operate or give treatment to boys with undescended testes leading to potential infertility and cancer issues. Yet, that did not meet the threshold for disclosure. I do not have time in this interaction but does he agree that this is now systemic? It is not one thing here and one thing there. One of the issues parents have raised is the idea of a partial ratified independent scrutiny-type investigation prism where parents would have monitoring and oversight of experts because we will keep continuing down this road and eventually have to concede a public inquiry.  The Taoiseach also mentioned in his introduction the announcement of a move to a seven-day operation of the health service. That is all well and good, but there is a shortage of 1,000 beds. There is a shortage of thousands of staff. Staff will be spread over seven days, potentially leading to more mistakes, more bad treatment and more people lying on trolleys. \n Deputy Máire Devine  In my first six months as a TD, I have been asked to intervene in four emergency mental health cases for constituents in Dublin South-Central. Three were for severe eating disorders where the patient's family feared for their survival if appropriate treatment was not provided immediately. The fourth acute patient simply sought a second medical opinion but was discouraged by the HSE at every stage. In all cases, the patients and their families felt they were not being heard by treating physicians and the scenarios were so dire I had to involve a Minister of State's office to procure emergency mental health attention and specialist assessment for the patients. Patients with life-threatening illnesses are having difficulty obtaining appropriate care. I am asking for an update on specialists in the eating disorder section. Why is the HSE not adhering to its national consent policy and established case law to respect a patient's choice to seek a second opinion? \n Deputy Conor D. McGuinness  Almost ten years ago the Taoiseach stood outside University Hospital Waterford with a billboard promising 24-7 cardiac care for Waterford and the south-east. Ten years on, the people of the south-east are still waiting. Cabinet approval was announced two months ago but since then there has been no detailed plan, timeline or staffing strategy. Announcements are cheap and it is delivery that matters. We have lost years waiting for that announcement and that go ahead. Without urgent action, lives remain at risk in Waterford and the wider south-east. Will the Taoiseach confirm if recruitment is completed, and when we will see a full implementation plan with timelines, staffing targets and guaranteed delivery of 24-7 cardiac care at UHW? \n Deputy Pádraig O'Sullivan  The Mazars report stated that the HSE has not been implementing the legal timelines for the reimbursement of medicines. I can refer to at least four studies commissioned in the past year that show legal timelines are not being adhered to. In February last year, the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association published a paper showing that 86% of all reimbursements did not adhere to the 180-day timeline as outlined in the legislation. The Taoiseach knows I am a long-term advocate for reform in this regard. I am asking that the HSE, its affiliates on the drugs group, the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics, NCPE, and others just implement the current legislation. Patients with unmet needs are waiting years for decisions in Ireland while the majority of our European counterparts wait months. Does the Taoiseach think, as per those reports, that the HSE and the NCPE are adhering to those guidelines? It is important that he clarifies that today. \n Deputy Michael Cahill  The national immunisation programme should include a vaccination for shingles free of charge for all our citizens. A vaccine to prevent shingles would be of great benefit to the entire population but would particularly benefit older people who are more susceptible to viral disease. Shingles can be quite painful and debilitating and these effects are more pronounced in older people. The costs would be beyond the budget of many and as a public health issue, a nationwide free vaccination scheme would benefit the entire population. Given that it is available free of charge in Northern Ireland, it should also be available here. We must support and protect our most vulnerable, those with health issues and those getting on in years. I urge the Taoiseach to liaise with the Ministers for Health, Finance and public expenditure to introduce this vaccine as soon as possible. \n Deputy Ruairí Ó Murchú  I pay tribute to 15-year-old Kofi Owusu from Dundalk, County Louth, who lost his life after getting into difficulty swimming in Laytown, County Meath, last Friday. Our condolences go to his family, his friends and to the wider community. We have all heard the tributes from Redeemer Celtic and Tomás Sharkey in Coláiste Chú Chulainn, the school he attended. We have heard of his diligence, his leadership qualities and his friendship. A huge hole has been left by this. We are talking about somebody who was a spectacular footballer and basketball player but he sounded like an all-round really great kid. This happened just a couple of days following the death of Isobel McCluskey and highlights the dangers of swimming and water. We hope we have a good summer but there is an absolute necessity that we do all we can with regard to information because we have had too many of these tragedies across Ireland. \n Deputy Paul Murphy  I want to raise the poor state of healthcare for those suffering with allergies in this country. Many parents are forced to spend huge amounts to travel abroad to get their children the treatment they need. I spoke to a woman a few months ago who had to go to America for six weeks. She had to pay €8,000 for treatment. She was also out of work for six weeks and had to pay for accommodation. That is not unusual. A lot of families go to Britain or America to get oral immunotherapy in particular. This can take the form of a tablet like Palforzia, which contains a tiny amount of peanuts for those suffering from peanut allergies, or oral immunotherapy where people, mostly children, are consuming tiny amounts of the product they are allergic to in controlled environments and they build up resistance over time to have a less severe allergic reaction. The problem is that these are not available within the Irish health system and are not even covered by the treatment abroad scheme. Does the Taoiseach agree we need a multiyear national allergy strategy and that we need to offer oral immunotherapy in this country? \n Deputy John Connolly  The healthcare sector is one sector of our public service that relies heavily on attracting and recruiting practitioners and staff internationally. In 2024, 6,000 of the 17,000 critical skills permits provided by the State were in the health or social work sectors, 5,031 of which were for nursing staff. In 2023, the OECD said that 54% of nurses working in Ireland had trained in other jurisdictions. The equivalent figure in the UK was 18%. I harbour a guess that many of them are probably Irish. I arrive at two conclusions from this. First, we are not training an adequate number of healthcare professionals, in particular practitioners and particularly nurses. Second, nurses particularly are choosing post qualification to seek opportunities in countries other than Ireland. Both of these conclusions need to be interrogated. \n The Taoiseach  I will start with Deputy Sherlock's questions on the patient safety (licensing) Bill and cervical cancer screening. The patient safety (licensing) Bill came through Cabinet today and the Minister can go through the details with the Deputy in due course, in terms of specifics on safe numbers, safe staffing and so forth. A lot of it has been introduced without legislation in accordance with agreements. The Minister will continue to resource the cervical cancer programme and other cancer screening programmes. It is important to say screening programmes are the first stage. They are population screening programmes designed to intervene early and identify but they are not the ultimate in diagnostic approaches. If people present with symptoms, they may need more detailed diagnostic assessment. We have to get the balance right. The public needs very clear information on screening programmes and what they can achieve and on the importance of always consulting a GP or consultant. That is extremely important because there are limits to screening programmes. There are calls to expand the number of screening programmes in different areas. We have made a lot of progress on cervical cancer screening because of new technology and new methodology but we are open to improving further and engaging with the various groupings to see what issues have been identified as problematic and how they can be improved. I will talk to the Minister for Health about that.  Deputies Daly and Cahill raised the shingles vaccine. My understanding is it is a significantly expensive vaccine. I am struck by the research Deputy Daly cited regarding its impact on the risk of dementia. A figure as high as 20% is very significant. He said the research was published recently in Nature so I will talk to the Minister for Health about that. Generally, I am a supporter of vaccines. As a public health intervention, they have been extremely effective in the history of this country. People are not dying of what people died from 100 years ago any more, primarily because of the successful introduction of vaccines to deal with a lot of infectious diseases. That is easily forgotten in modern discourse and debates. The Covid-19 vaccine was essential to society coming back to some degree of normality. Without that vaccine, we would still be in deep trouble. It is important to state that. I will go to the Minister in respect of that.  Deputy O'Rourke raised CHI. Every family must be told whether their child required surgery. There has to be complete transparency from CHI in respect of that. There has to be diligent follow-up with all concerned, as it declared. We will ensure that happens. I will talk to the Minister on engaging with CHI on that issue.  Deputy Coppinger raised CHI, again, and the issue relating to young boys. That is a very serious issue, which needs to be addressed transparently and comprehensively by CHI. The HSE and the Department of Health should be involved in respect of that issue. The Dickson report from 2017 on urology services in CHI proposed the consolidation of all paediatric urology services into a single, cohesive centre, the establishment of a multidisciplinary urology team and so forth. That key issue needs to be further examined in light of that report. The issues the Deputy has identified should have been disclosed earlier.  That is a very good agreement between the HSE and the unions. Healthcare staff numbers have risen enormously in the past four to five years with 30,000 extra. We cannot keep on saying, \"Let's get another couple of thousand.\" There has to be a balance. \n Deputy Ruth Coppinger  There is a huge shortage. \n The Taoiseach  There is not a huge shortage. Thousands of people have been recruited. Let us be straight about it. The seven-day use of hospitals is something that should happen. It should not be dependent on more and more staff. The assets were not being used. Expensive diagnostic equipment was not being used optimally and the hospitals themselves were not being used optimally when there were five-day, nine-to-five services. Productivity matters, as do new devices and new technology. We need a broader approach to get better value for money. We have invested hugely in health and that needs to be acknowledged. Productivity and value for money are also factors. We are recruiting a further 6,000 in 2025, in addition to the 30,000 that have been recruited. I accept the population is increasing and that will create demand for services. It has created a lot of demand for health services. The population is ageing, which is creating further demand for the health service. That deal is a good one and will lead to greater productivity in hospitals and health services.  On mental health issues, the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, has been doing significant work on eating disorders. Deputy Devine could talk to her about the specifics of the cases she has raised. We need more investment in eating disorder centres but we have had some. A lot of progress has been made in that respect.  Deputy McGuinness raised cardiac care. Much progress has been made in the past five years in respect of cath lab investment in Waterford. It has been incrementally building up. There has been quite good investment in the past two to three years. Now we will complete that in terms of 24-7 provision. That is a Government decision that has been taken and that will happen. Recruitment in healthcare takes time. It does not happen within two months but it will happen and that will be developed, as committed to by Government.  Deputy O'Sullivan raised the reimbursement of medication. More progress needs to be made on the reimbursement of medicines. Quite a lot has been made. I met IPHA representatives who represent the pharmaceutical industry here. Understandably, it is promoting this but when I questioned IPHA members two years ago, they were more or less saying they had a good enough relationship with the national pharmacovigilance unit. As a country with a strong concentration of pharmaceutical companies and which produces some of the most effective medicines in the world, we should have a modern, up-to-date reimbursement process. However, that has implications for public expenditure. Progress has been made but we need to make more, and we need to meet the standards and European norms.  Deputy Cahill raised the shingles vaccine. I do not doubt the benefits but the expenditure would be significant. We need to bear that in mind.  I join Deputy Ó Murchú in offering sympathy to Kofi's family. It is heartbreaking that any young person so talented and with so much to offer in life should die in such circumstances. The Deputy mentioned Isobel McCluskey as well. The national emergency forum - there is a more precise title for it - did a lot of work on water safety in terms of swimming in rivers and in the sea over the past two years, and on prevention. One of the most effective interventions in healthcare is prevention. Public health messaging on accidents is a key dimension of that and is a factor in injuries and deaths. Our sympathies go to all in the community and the families affected.  Deputy Murphy raised the issue of allergies. We have multidisciplinary teams involved in allergy.  I defer to medical and professional advice within our own system on the provision of oral immunology therapy. It is a complex area that takes a lot of building up of immunology. A lot of children have spent a lot of time with consultants so I am slightly worried. I am not an expert on this but I defer to proper, professional advice as to when such medicines could be accessed or used. I say to everybody out there to consult their GP and consultant in respect of the utilisation of any therapies in that regard.  Deputy Connolly mentioned nursing and 6,000 critical skills permits, of which I think he said 5,000 were in nursing. There are two ways of looking at it. A lot of young graduates travel and have been travelling for a long time in the medical world. There may be an issue of retention. Some come back to work in Ireland later on and there are huge specialties available to nurses in Ireland. There are huge programmes, including postgraduate programmes and specialist programmes. We have developed the likes of intensive care nursing and cardiac nursing very well with native talent. There has been phenomenal change in nursing in Ireland over the last 20 years, from the degree programmes to the postgraduate programmes. However, there is an issue of retention and retraining people and we have to be more innovative in terms of how we do that into the future and we then attract nurses from other jurisdictions into the country. \n An Cathaoirleach Gníomhach (Deputy Mark Wall)  I thank the Taoiseach. I am informed the time for Taoiseach's Questions has finished so we will move on to statements on nursing homes and care for older persons. We will wait for the Minister of State to join us. \n Deputy Peadar Tóibín  In fairness, Chair, that is not fair. A lot of us were waiting here for questions and the Taoiseach took an inordinate amount of time to whitter on with those answers. Do the same rules not apply to the Taoiseach as apply to everybody else in this House? \n Deputy Conor D. McGuinness  While we are waiting for the Minister of State, Chair. \n An Cathaoirleach Gníomhach (Deputy Mark Wall)  That is what I have been informed by the clerk. \n Deputy Ruairí Ó Murchú  We might continue, Chair. The Taoiseach has signalled a willingness to continue. \n The Taoiseach  That is very unfair of Deputy Tóibín. He arrived late himself. \n Deputy Peadar Tóibín  In fairness, we get a minute. It is timed and we are told to stop. There was no umpiring of the time on this occasion at all. \n The Taoiseach  I am normally very generous, Deputy. Come on. I am normally very generous. \n An Cathaoirleach Gníomhach (Deputy Mark Wall)  I am told the rule is 45 minutes. The time is up so I have to proceed to the next item on the Order of Business, which is statements. \n Deputy Peadar Tóibín  Normally, the time is split in a certain way to make sure the three groupings are taken in the 45 minutes. \n The Taoiseach  In the first grouping, there were many questions answered. I accept there are several questions in the third grouping. A lot of people did not turn up at all at the beginning. It cuts each way. All of the Deputies wanted this session------ \n Deputy Peadar Tóibín  It should cut both ways. That is the point I am trying to make. \n The Taoiseach  -----but the number of Deputies who were absent at the beginning of this session left me surprised. \n Deputy Brian Stanley  I have a point of order. On the previous occasion when statements on nursing homes were taken, some of us waited until the very end of the night to get our slot. I hope that will be taken now. ",

        "extracted_answer": "The Taoiseach  I propose to take Questions Nos. 10 to 20, inclusive, together.  The Cabinet committee on health last met on 4 June 2025 and is due to meet again on 17 July 2025. It oversees implementation of programme for Government commitments in relation to health, receives detailed reports on identified policy areas and considers health reforms, including Sláintecare and the reform of public health and health system preparedness for future health threats. It also receives reports on programme for Government commitments in the areas of mental health and drugs policy.  Path to Universal Healthcare: Sláintecare & Programme for Government 2025+, our latest Sláintecare strategy published last month, aims to forge the way towards accessible, affordable, high-quality, healthcare for the people when they need it and where they need it. We will continue to build our workforce through the recruitment of key roles, retention measures and additional college places for key disciplines. We have capacity to hire a further 6,105 whole-time equivalents, WTEs, to Department of Health-funded posts during the remainder of 2025. We will deliver faster access to care. Funding of €420 million has been allocated for the waiting list action plan 2025. We will continue to review capacity in emergency departments. We will increase the number of public-only consultants in emergency medicine and ensure more senior staff are rostered in emergency departments during weekends and public holidays for better decision-making. The construction of 297 new and replacement acute beds is expected to be completed in 2025. The surgical hub for south Dublin opened in February this year with additional hubs becoming operational later in 2025 and 2026. We will continue to invest in a healthier future with a national physical activity framework and action plan due to be published in 2025 and a new obesity policy and action plan to be published in 2026.  We are launching a new era of innovation and digital transformation in health. The national patient app has been rolled out, with additional features to be added later in the year. The national shared care record will be developed throughout the year and the electronic health record will also be progressed. Additional projects which are key to the increased digitalisation of the health service include a national system for electronic prescribing and remote health monitoring and virtual care solutions. In mental health we will continue to build the mental health workforce and infrastructure and support community-based services. In older people’s services we will support people to live at home within their communities and strengthen the nursing home sector. The welfare of residents is at the forefront of Government’s concerns. The forthcoming national policy on adult safeguarding for the health and social care sector, which is a programme for Government commitment, will set out how existing protections will be strengthened. This policy is near finalisation and will be brought to Government shortly.  All these commitments build on the investment and reforms undertaken over the past number of years, including the delivery of approximately 1,282 acute beds, an increased workforce of close to 30,000 since the start of 2020, more affordable healthcare through reductions in the drugs payment scheme threshold to €80, removal of hospital inpatient charges, extension of the eligibility for free GP cards for all children under eight and to all earning no more than the median income, State-funded IVF, free contraception for women aged 17 to 35 and free access to HRT therapies. From September 2021 to April 2025, there has been an almost 60% reduction in the number of people waiting longer than 12 months. Care is being delivered closer to home in 180 primary care centres through 96 community health networks, 27 community specialist teams for older persons and 26 community specialist teams for chronic disease are now operational.

Our condolences go to his family, his friends and to the wider community. We have all heard the tributes from Redeemer Celtic and Tomás Sharkey in Coláiste Chú Chulainn, the school he attended. We have heard of his diligence, his leadership qualities and his friendship. A huge hole has been left by this.

We hope we have a good summer but there is an absolute necessity that we do all we can with regard to information because we have had too many of these tragedies across Ireland. \n Deputy Paul Murphy  I want to raise the poor state of healthcare for those suffering with allergies in this country. Many parents are forced to spend huge amounts to travel abroad to get their children the treatment they need. I spoke to a woman a few months ago who had to go to America for six weeks. She had to pay €8,000 for treatment. She was also out of work for six weeks and had to pay for accommodation. That is not unusual. A lot of families go to Britain or America to get oral immunotherapy in particular. This can take the form of a tablet like Palforzia, which contains a tiny amount of peanuts for those suffering from peanut allergies, or oral immunotherapy where people, mostly children, are consuming tiny amounts of the product they are allergic to in controlled environments and they build up resistance over time to have a less severe allergic reaction. The problem is that these are not available within the Irish health system and are not even covered by the treatment abroad scheme. Does the Taoiseach agree we need a multiyear national allergy strategy and that we need to offer oral immunotherapy in this country? \n Deputy John Connolly  The healthcare sector is one sector of our public service that relies heavily on attracting and recruiting practitioners and staff internationally. In 2024, 6,000 of the 17,000 critical skills permits provided by the State were in the health or social work sectors, 5,031 of which were for nursing staff. In 2023, the OECD said that 54% of nurses working in Ireland had trained in other jurisdictions. The equivalent figure in the UK was 18%. I harbour a guess that many of them are probably Irish. I arrive at two conclusions from this. First, we are not training an adequate number of healthcare professionals, in particular practitioners and particularly nurses. Second, nurses particularly are choosing post qualification to seek opportunities in countries other than Ireland. Both of these conclusions need to be interrogated. \n The Taoiseach  I will start with Deputy Sherlock's questions on the patient safety (licensing) Bill and cervical cancer screening. The patient safety (licensing) Bill came through Cabinet today and the Minister can go through the details with the Deputy in due course, in terms of specifics on safe numbers, safe staffing and so forth. A lot of it has been introduced without legislation in accordance with agreements. The Minister will continue to resource the cervical cancer programme and other cancer screening programmes. It is important to say screening programmes are the first stage. They are population screening programmes designed to intervene early and identify but they are not the ultimate in diagnostic approaches. If people present with symptoms, they may need more detailed diagnostic assessment. We have to get the balance right. The public needs very clear information on screening programmes and what they can achieve and on the importance of always consulting a GP or consultant. That is extremely important because there are limits to screening programmes. There are calls to expand the number of screening programmes in different areas. We have made a lot of progress on cervical cancer screening because of new technology and new methodology but we are open to improving further and engaging with the various groupings to see what issues have been identified as problematic and how they can be improved. I will talk to the Minister for Health about that.  Deputies Daly and Cahill raised the shingles vaccine. My understanding is it is a significantly expensive vaccine. I am struck by the research Deputy Daly cited regarding its impact on the risk of dementia. A figure as high as 20% is very significant. He said the research was published recently in Nature so I will talk to the Minister for Health about that. Generally, I am a supporter of vaccines. As a public health intervention, they have been extremely effective in the history of this country. People are not dying of what people died from 100 years ago any more, primarily because of the successful introduction of vaccines to deal with a lot of infectious diseases. That is easily forgotten in modern discourse and debates. The Covid-19 vaccine was essential to society coming back to some degree of normality. Without that vaccine, we would still be in deep trouble. It is important to state that. I will go to the Minister in respect of that.  Deputy O'Rourke raised CHI. Every family must be told whether their child required surgery. There has to be complete transparency from CHI in respect of that. There has to be diligent follow-up with all concerned, as it declared. We will ensure that happens. I will talk to the Minister on engaging with CHI on that issue.  Deputy Coppinger raised CHI, again, and the issue relating to young boys. That is a very serious issue, which needs to be addressed transparently and comprehensively by CHI. The HSE and the Department of Health should be involved in respect of that issue. The Dickson report from 2017 on urology services in CHI proposed the consolidation of all paediatric urology services into a single, cohesive centre, the establishment of a multidisciplinary urology team and so forth. That key issue needs to be further examined in light of that report. The issues the Deputy has identified should have been disclosed earlier.  That is a very good agreement between the HSE and the unions. Healthcare staff numbers have risen enormously in the past four to five years with 30,000 extra. We cannot keep on saying, \"Let's get another couple of thousand.\" There has to be a balance. \n Deputy Ruth Coppinger  There is a huge shortage. \n The Taoiseach  There is not a huge shortage. Thousands of people have been recruited. Let us be straight about it. The seven-day use of hospitals is something that should happen. It should not be dependent on more and more staff. The assets were not being used. Expensive diagnostic equipment was not being used optimally and the hospitals themselves were not being used optimally when there were five-day, nine-to-five services. Productivity matters, as do new devices and new technology. We need a broader approach to get better value for money. We have invested hugely in health and that needs to be acknowledged. Productivity and value for money are also factors. We are recruiting a further 6,000 in 2025, in addition to the 30,000 that have been recruited. I accept the population is increasing and that will create demand for services. It has created a lot of demand for health services. The population is ageing, which is creating further demand for the health service. That deal is a good one and will lead to greater productivity in hospitals and health services.  On mental health issues, the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, has been doing significant work on eating disorders. Deputy Devine could talk to her about the specifics of the cases she has raised. We need more investment in eating disorder centres but we have had some. A lot of progress has been made in that respect.  Deputy McGuinness raised cardiac care. Much progress has been made in the past five years in respect of cath lab investment in Waterford. It has been incrementally building up. There has been quite good investment in the past two to three years. Now we will complete that in terms of 24-7 provision. That is a Government decision that has been taken and that will happen. Recruitment in healthcare takes time. It does not happen within two months but it will happen and that will be developed, as committed to by Government.  Deputy O'Sullivan raised the reimbursement of medication. More progress needs to be made on the reimbursement of medicines. Quite a lot has been made. I met IPHA representatives who represent the pharmaceutical industry here. Understandably, it is promoting this but when I questioned IPHA members two years ago, they were more or less saying they had a good enough relationship with the national pharmacovigilance unit. As a country with a strong concentration of pharmaceutical companies and which produces some of the most effective medicines in the world, we should have a modern, up-to-date reimbursement process. However, that has implications for public expenditure. Progress has been made but we need to make more, and we need to meet the standards and European norms.  Deputy Cahill raised the shingles vaccine. I do not doubt the benefits but the expenditure would be significant. We need to bear that in mind.  I join Deputy Ó Murchú in offering sympathy to Kofi's family. It is heartbreaking that any young person so talented and with so much to offer in life should die in such circumstances. The Deputy mentioned Isobel McCluskey as well. The national emergency forum - there is a more precise title for it - did a lot of work on water safety in terms of swimming in rivers and in the sea over the past two years, and on prevention. One of the most effective interventions in healthcare is prevention. Public health messaging on accidents is a key dimension of that and is a factor in injuries and deaths. Our sympathies go to all in the community and the families affected.  Deputy Murphy raised the issue of allergies. We have multidisciplinary teams involved in allergy.  I defer to medical and professional advice within our own system on the provision of oral immunology therapy. It is a complex area that takes a lot of building up of immunology. A lot of children have spent a lot of time with consultants so I am slightly worried. I am not an expert on this but I defer to proper, professional advice as to when such medicines could be accessed or used. I say to everybody out there to consult their GP and consultant in respect of the utilisation of any therapies in that regard.  Deputy Connolly mentioned nursing and 6,000 critical skills permits, of which I think he said 5,000 were in nursing. There are two ways of looking at it. A lot of young graduates travel and have been travelling for a long time in the medical world. There may be an issue of retention. Some come back to work in Ireland later on and there are huge specialties available to nurses in Ireland. There are huge programmes, including postgraduate programmes and specialist programmes. We have developed the likes of intensive care nursing and cardiac nursing very well with native talent. There has been phenomenal change in nursing in Ireland over the last 20 years, from the degree programmes to the postgraduate programmes. However, there is an issue of retention and retraining people and we have to be more innovative in terms of how we do that into the future and we then attract nurses from other jurisdictions into the country. \n An Cathaoirleach Gníomhach (Deputy Mark Wall)  I thank the Taoiseach. I am informed the time for Taoiseach's Questions has finished so we will move on to statements on nursing homes and care for older persons. We will wait for the Minister of State to join us. \n Deputy Peadar Tóibín  In fairness, Chair, that is not fair. A lot of us were waiting here for questions and the Taoiseach took an inordinate amount of time to whitter on with those answers. Do the same rules not apply to the Taoiseach as apply to everybody else in this House? \n Deputy Conor D. McGuinness  While we are waiting for the Minister of State, Chair. \n An Cathaoirleach Gníomhach (Deputy Mark Wall)  That is what I have been informed by the clerk. \n Deputy Ruairí Ó Murchú  We might continue, Chair. The Taoiseach has signalled a willingness to continue. \n The Taoiseach  That is very unfair of Deputy Tóibín. He arrived late himself. \n Deputy Peadar Tóibín  In fairness, we get a minute. It is timed and we are told to stop. There was no umpiring of the time on this occasion at all. \n The Taoiseach  I am normally very generous, Deputy. Come on. I am normally very generous. \n An Cathaoirleach Gníomhach (Deputy Mark Wall)  I am told the rule is 45 minutes. The time is up so I have to proceed to the next item on the Order of Business, which is statements. \n Deputy Peadar Tóibín  Normally, the time is split in a certain way to make sure the three groupings are taken in the 45 minutes. \n The Taoiseach  In the first grouping, there were many questions answered. I accept there are several questions in the third grouping. A lot of people did not turn up at all at the beginning. It cuts each way. All of the Deputies wanted this session------ \n Deputy Peadar Tóibín  It should cut both ways. That is the point I am trying to make. \n The Taoiseach  -----but the number of Deputies who were absent at the beginning of this session left me surprised. \n Deputy Brian Stanley  I have a point of order. On the previous occasion when statements on nursing homes were taken, some of us waited until the very end of the night to get our slot. I hope that will be taken now.",

        "answerText": " Deputy Pa Daly  Is the Minister aware that the CCAC's recently published annual review of the transport sector is clear that the Government is failing when it comes to a just transition? There are serious problems in the transport sector because it is Ireland's biggest source of energy demand. Last year, transport emissions reduced by only a tiny 1.3%. \n Minister for Transport (Deputy Darragh O'Brien)  I thank the Deputy for his question. I welcome the publication of the Climate Change Advisory Council's annual sectoral review of the transport sector. I recently met with the council and, separately, with its chair, Marie Donnelly. We had a very constructive discussion. My Department and I will be reviewing this report and its recommendations. I certainly will take them into account as we update our approach to next iteration of the climate action plan later this year, which will be its 26th iteration.  The annual report from the CCAC is a critical input into our policy approach. While there has been an unprecedented level of investment in sustainable transport and electric vehicle, EV, supports over recent years, I fully agree with the council's assessment that we are not yet achieving the pace of change required to achieve our 2030 climate objectives. The report acknowledges that, despite challenges, good progress has been made, particularly in the increased usage and expansion of public transport services, which we debated last week, with broad acknowledgement across the House of progress made. That progress has benefited from the Government's support for reduced public transport fees, which we will further expand later this year by way of free transport for five- to eight-year-olds.  We are confident we will achieve our electric vehicle, EV, targets for 2025, with 177,000 EVs on the road at this point of the year and a continued rebound in EV sales. Public transport passenger numbers are now at record levels, registering more than 1 million journeys daily. Our renewable fuel blending ambitions are on target as well, with a growing number of private sector entities ramping up their use of low-carbon fuels such as hydrotreated vegetable oil, HVO, and compressed natural gas, CNG. \n Deputy Pa Daly  I do not agree with the Minister's claim about all the progress being made. In fact, progress is stalling and any gains that have been made are quickly being overtaken because the plan is not delivering. We definitely will miss the target of having 1 million EVs on Irish roads by the end of the decade. The Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, has said we will probably miss it by up to 300,000. Sales of new EVs have fallen by 24% and there was an 8.1% decline in used imports.  We are also falling way behind in the roll-out of the charging infrastructure, with a deficit in rural areas in particular. At the end of 2024, there were 2,802 publicly accessible charging points. That is seven per 10,000 people, compared with 13 per 10,000 in Britain. As with retrofitting, it is only those with significant means who can afford to participate in the grant scheme. There is a serious problem in that EVs are more accessible for middle-class people than for working-class people. \n Deputy Darragh O'Brien  I said last week that I am reviewing the EV grants. We have made significant progress. The Deputy referred to the reduction in growth in that sector last year but he did not mention that quarter 1 of this year saw a significant rebound in EV sales and registrations. Today, I brought to Government a policy on renewable fuels for transport, which sets out the ambition in this regard. It takes into account the sustainability issues the CCAC has, rightly, highlighted.  No one is denying, in any way, shape or form, the challenges ahead in meeting our very exacting targets. However, if we look at where we have come from in regard to EVs, electrification of the public transport fleet and alternative fuel use by the heavy goods vehicle, HGV, sector and by the bus fleet across the country, progress has undoubtedly been made. I respect the work of the CCAC, which is why I met its members in plenary session. The chair was there and I met her separately as well. I value the council's input and it will inform any policy changes we make into the future. \n Deputy Pa Daly  Does the Minister accept there is a problem with accessibility and affordability in rural areas and less well-off areas? Will he make any provision in the next budget to broaden the grant scheme to make it more accessible and affordable and, perhaps, as the CCAC suggested, extend it to second-hand EVs in order that people who have less money can afford to purchase one?  The EPA's assessment of ports indicates our ports are way behind and that much more must be done to deal with more frequent storms, floods and coastal erosion, particularly on the east coast. What steps are being taken to make ports more resilient to the storms and weather events we will see in future? \n Deputy Darragh O'Brien  We are trying to cover a lot in a short time. We will have a chance to go through a lot of these points in more detail at the transport committee, which is meeting tomorrow, and at the environment committee.  Regarding EV charging, under the motorway infrastructure scheme, 131 additional high-powered charging points across 17 different locations on the motorway network will be delivered by the end of this year. There is also a scheme to fund high-powered charging on national primary routes, with 175 high-powered charging points to be provided at 53 different locations. The infrastructure is certainly increasing and will increase further.  The Deputy referred to issues with accessibility to EVs in respect of income and in areas that do not have as much public transport as others. I am looking at options, as I said here last week, for how I can reframe the grants. That will potentially require Government approval. I am also looking at options regarding second-hand EVs, which I will bring forward later this year. I will be happy to share those proposals with the transport committee once they are approved. ",

        "answerText": " Deputy Ciarán Ahern  What steps has the Minister taken to ensure the safety of drivers and passengers on Dublin Bus in the aftermath of the very serious incident at Mountjoy Square in April in which a man threatened a bus driver with a gun? Will he outline his plans for a dedicated transport police force? \n Deputy Darragh O'Brien  I thank the Deputy for his question on what is a real and important issue for public transport users. We debated it in some detail yesterday. Particularly among those who do not use public transport often, they can have a certain perception of the level of safety on it.  To the Deputy's specific question, antisocial behaviour is a broad societal issue to which public transport is not immune. It is those passengers and staff who regularly use and work within our public transport network who are most directly impacted by any safety or security incidents that occur.  We have a strong commitment in the programme for Government to create a transport security force under the NTA, which would operate similarly and have similar powers to airport police and customs officers. That will supplement the work already being done by An Garda Síochána. I assure the Deputy that I am taking this commitment forward as a priority. Work is under way in my Department, in conjunction with the NTA, to identify the most appropriate organisational structure to progress it. Last week, my Department officials and I met the Minister for justice and his team to examine the role they will have in the establishment of the force. We will continue that engagement towards its implementation to ensure the positive collaboration between An Garda Síochána and the operators is maintained.  We are in the preliminary stages of this deliberative process and it is important to note that the introduction of such a force will require the development of legislation. Work will also be required in respect of existing by-laws. I will be looking for the co-operation and assistance of all parties in this regard because most will see the benefits of the creation of this force, which will be an additional resource to the very good work already being done by An Garda Síochána. We need to make sure that, as we continue to expand our public transport system, this force will be in place on all public transport operators, whether on road, trains or the Luas. \n Deputy Ciarán Ahern  It is good to hear that work is under way. We would like to see a separate division of An Garda Síochána rather than a separate policing force. I would like to understand the Minister's thoughts on that. Antisocial behaviour and violence on public transport happens in all of our constituencies, not least in my own constituency of Dublin South-West. It does not often get too much public attention. I am thankful that our community in Dublin South-West is working constructively to reduce these issues. We hold monthly transport forum meetings between local gardaí, juvenile liaison officers, Dublin Bus drivers, Luas drivers, the local council - that is important - local community groups, youth groups and public representatives to try to ensure drivers and passengers can experience a safe environment on public transport. An Garda Síochána is really throwing the kitchen sink at this but it needs more and it needs it quickly. \n Deputy Darragh O'Brien  I agree on that point. An Garda Síochána is doing a good job already. The Deputy will be aware of Operation Saul. That is under way. To take the Dublin metropolitan region, the area in which we have the best data in this regard, as an example, there are gardaí delivering both overt and covert policing on bus, Luas, DART and other train services. In 2024, the operation resulted in 754 arrests, 1,289 charges preferred and 280 summonses. Between 1 January 2025 and 21 March 2025, there were 194 arrests and 381 charges preferred, so the Garda is doing its job. The Government committed to providing additional gardaí in the programme for Government and we intend to fulfil that commitment. The transport security force will have a very specific role. It will support the work of An Garda Síochána but, working with the operators, it will particularly focus on the black spots, the areas where the predominance of antisocial behaviour occurs, in order to stamp that out at the start. \n Deputy Ciarán Ahern  I will press the Minister again to provide a more defined timeline for this. When does he think it is going to be done? Has the Minister looked at the Travel Safe policy document prepared by SIPTU? Has he met SIPTU or any other interested parties yet? I suggest that he do. There is one proposal from SIPTU I was particularly taken with. It related to public transport assistance units. These would be social care intervention officers specifically trained to deal with those causing a public disturbance on the public transport network. This would be more applicable to interventions in respect of underlying social care issues. These officers would work with the transport police in whatever format that force took. I ask the Minister to really consider that because, from talking to the JLO in my area at our Tallaght transport forum meetings, I know that is the way forward if we are talking about interventions and ASBOs on public transport. Some 80% to 90% of young people do not reoffend after a JLO intervention. That is to be preferred to a court or criminal intervention. \n Deputy Darragh O'Brien  We have a public transport safety working group on which unions, workers and operators are represented. I have met these representatives. We will be discussing this in more detail. I assure the Deputy that, when the proposals in this regard become clear, I will be seeking their input.  I do not have an exact timeframe for the Deputy. Suffice it to say that this is an important priority. We first have to agree the way forward as regards the structure of the force. It will operate under the NTA but we need to consider its interaction with An Garda Síochána, from which it will be separate. We will then need to draft legislation. In the meantime, An Garda Síochána is working on this.  Security spending in Iarnród Éireann was up 41% in 2025. It is the same with Dublin Bus. It has three dedicated units operating in north, south and central Dublin. As of February 2025, Bus Éireann operates a mobile security unit. The Luas also has its own security force. That will continue while we continue to prepare legislation to establish the force. ",

[34557/25]",
        "extracted_answer": "Deputy Ciarán Ahern  What steps has the Minister taken to ensure the safety of drivers and passengers on Dublin Bus in the aftermath of the very serious incident at Mountjoy Square in April in which a man threatened a bus driver with a gun? Will he outline his plans for a dedicated transport police force? \n Deputy Darragh O'Brien  I thank the Deputy for his question on what is a real and important issue for public transport users. We debated it in some detail yesterday. Particularly among those who do not use public transport often, they can have a certain perception of the level of safety on it.  To the Deputy's specific question, antisocial behaviour is a broad societal issue to which public transport is not immune. It is those passengers and staff who regularly use and work within our public transport network who are most directly impacted by any safety or security incidents that occur.  We have a strong commitment in the programme for Government to create a transport security force under the NTA, which would operate similarly and have similar powers to airport police and customs officers. That will supplement the work already being done by An Garda Síochána. I assure the Deputy that I am taking this commitment forward as a priority. Work is under way in my Department, in conjunction with the NTA, to identify the most appropriate organisational structure to progress it. Last week, my Department officials and I met the Minister for justice and his team to examine the role they will have in the establishment of the force. We will continue that engagement towards its implementation to ensure the positive collaboration between An Garda Síochána and the operators is maintained.  We are in the preliminary stages of this deliberative process and it is important to note that the introduction of such a force will require the development of legislation. Work will also be required in respect of existing by-laws. I will be looking for the co-operation and assistance of all parties in this regard because most will see the benefits of the creation of this force, which will be an additional resource to the very good work already being done by An Garda Síochána. We need to make sure that, as we continue to expand our public transport system, this force will be in place on all public transport operators, whether on road, trains or the Luas. \n Deputy Ciarán Ahern  It is good to hear that work is under way. We would like to see a separate division of An Garda Síochána rather than a separate policing force. I would like to understand the Minister's thoughts on that. Antisocial behaviour and violence on public transport happens in all of our constituencies, not least in my own constituency of Dublin South-West. It does not often get too much public attention. I am thankful that our community in Dublin South-West is working constructively to reduce these issues. We hold monthly transport forum meetings between local gardaí, juvenile liaison officers, Dublin Bus drivers, Luas drivers, the local council - that is important - local community groups, youth groups and public representatives to try to ensure drivers and passengers can experience a safe environment on public transport. An Garda Síochána is really throwing the kitchen sink at this but it needs more and it needs it quickly. \n Deputy Darragh O'Brien  I agree on that point. An Garda Síochána is doing a good job already. The Deputy will be aware of Operation Saul. That is under way. To take the Dublin metropolitan region, the area in which we have the best data in this regard, as an example, there are gardaí delivering both overt and covert policing on bus, Luas, DART and other train services. In 2024, the operation resulted in 754 arrests, 1,289 charges preferred and 280 summonses.

        "answerText": " Deputy Jennifer Whitmore  Is the Minister aware of the ongoing issues with the provision of Go-Ahead Ireland's bus service in County Wicklow and the fact that its contract is up for renewal? I extend an invitation to him to come to Wicklow and stand at a bus stop down there with me and wait for the bus to come, seeing as invitations are being thrown out this evening. \n Deputy Darragh O'Brien  We will all be travelling on buses together soon. I use the bus a lot but not in Wicklow.  I am aware, as the Deputy obviously is, that Go-Ahead Ireland has experienced difficulties in maintaining service levels, particularly in the first quarter of this year, primarily due to a shortage of mechanics. In response, the company took a number of remedial actions, including bringing in additional mechanics from Britain and securing further technical support from external sources. I understand that the situation has improved significantly since then, not necessarily on every route, with fleet availability returning to normal within a relatively short period. Go-Ahead Ireland has reported that since January, eight new engineering staff have joined the company and 129 drivers have started in the driving school. In addition, Go-Ahead Ireland has completed overseas recruitment, with ten engineers expected to start in September.  The NTA monitors the performance of all public transport operators, as the Deputy will know. Under existing contractual arrangements, financial penalties apply where performance falls below agreed standards. The NTA continues to engage with Go-Ahead Ireland to enhance service reliability.  Having said that, things will happen but we need to ensure as best as possible that punctuality and reliability and, underpinning that, affordability happen. I instructed the NTA to carry out a review of the ghost bus phenomenon, for want of a better phrase, and I continue to keep that positive pressure on in my supporting role as Minister to make sure that people can be assured that buses which are scheduled arrive on time.  In my supplementary reply, I will provide a little more detail of what will happen in the coming period. I have initial information from review; I do not have the completed information on it. If there are any particular matters relating to Wicklow or anywhere else as regards buses not showing up, I want to know about it. \n Deputy Jennifer Whitmore  The roll-out started in January, and there were major problems when it started. It has got better. Unfortunately, there are still problems on many routes, including the L2, L1, L3 and L15. The reality is that people who go to get a bus need to know that it will show up. They need more than to think that it might show up or that it will show up most of the time. A bus needs to show up every single time or else people will not use buses and will not be able to trust the service. Unfortunately, that is what is happening in Wicklow, with buses not showing up, buses being late and elderly people having to wait for two hours for an hourly bus that just did not appear. I have had two instances this month of the last bus of the night being cancelled. It is completely unacceptable for that to happen. I raised the matter with the NTA, which stated that this is not to be allowed at all. We have had multiple instances of it, so there are still major problems. \n Deputy Darragh O'Brien  There is still work to be done. We are adding new routes. As everyone knows, in all sectors, but particularly around drivers and mechanics, there have been shortages of workers because it is a very competitive environment. We have commenced further recruitment across all our transport operators.  We started the review in spring. Two of the main reasons for buses not showing up are, one, late notification by operators of cancelled and curtailed services, with that resulting in incorrect information being given to customers, and, two, technical issues with the older bus automatic vehicle location equipment. That equipment is being replaced with live data on each bus. This will improve the service greatly from 2026.  We have to continue to monitor the situation. The Deputy is right to raise complaints, certainly, but let us not lose sight of the fact that we had a record number of passenger journeys last year. We are at about 1 million public transport passenger journeys every day now. \n Deputy Jennifer Whitmore  I thank the Minister for that. I acknowledge that there have been improvements, but some routes have been particularly hit. I believe they are those routes in Wicklow. This is one of the problems. When a bus does not show up, it requires the person left standing there to email the NTA, Go-Ahead Ireland or a TD. They usually come to a public representative and say there are problems. When we see that there are multiple problems, we raise the matter here with the Minister. What would be really useful is transparency when it comes to what is being missed. No-Show Bus in Cork was set up by a student there, and there is one in Dublin that was set up by Dublin Inquirer . If we had some sort of system like that, it would bring greater transparency in respect of this problem. If we could see exactly how problematic this is, the difficulties it is causing and on what routes it is causing them, in a more real-time fashion, that would be very useful. \n Deputy Darragh O'Brien  The transparency around this is there. The operators have to report on service level agreements. When specific issues arise, a lot of the time I see that people will tweet the NTA on X, send emails or whatever. I get text messages regularly, including from my daughter if a bus does not show up when she is travelling to DCU, so I know from my family that this happens from time to time. There can be understandable reasons for this. We need to build up the human resources within each of the operators. Go-Ahead Ireland has very specific issues relating to staffing. What I was not happy about at the time - and it was early in my tenure - was the fact that I had no sight of those issues to know that its resources were that tight. It has addressed that matter since, and fair play to it for doing so.  Fines are levied. In 2024, operators were fined just short of €1.5 million by the NTA for not meeting their service level agreements. We have to continually watch this to ensure that we have a reliable, punctual service. ",

        "answerText": " Deputy Pa Daly  As the Minister probably knows, under the Air Navigation (Carriage of Munitions of War, Weapons and Dangerous Goods) Orders 1974 and 1989, it is prohibited for civil aircraft to carry munitions of war in Irish sovereign territory without being granted an exemption to do so by the Minister for Transport. Is the Minister aware of this? I presume he is. Complaints have been made that Israeli munitions are being carried. Will the Minister make a statement on the matter? \n Deputy Darragh O'Brien  I am aware of the regulations and the legislation. The Chicago convention of 1944 is the main international treaty that governs the operation of international civil aviation. Article 35 of that convention provides that no civil aircraft may carry munitions of war in the sovereign territory of a state without that state's permission. That provision is implemented in Irish law in the Air Navigation (Carriage of Munitions of War, Weapons and Dangerous Goods) Orders 1973 and 1989.  Under these orders, the carriage of munitions of war is prohibited on any civil aircraft in Irish sovereign territory unless I in my role as Minister for Transport have granted an exemption that permits it. From October 2023 to date, no applications have been received and no exemptions have been granted for the carriage of munitions of war to any point in Israel.  Any exemption granted is not a permission to carry munitions of war from one foreign state to another. It is only in respect of the operation of such a flight through Irish sovereign territory. The granting of an exemption permits entry to and exit from Irish sovereign territory. When an application for an exemption is refused, the flight must redirect.  I am aware of media reports that allege several air operators have flown through Irish sovereign territory while carrying munitions of war without the required permission. My officials have engaged in examining those allegations, communicating with the air operators concerned, collating the information and scrutinising the data gathered. We are committed to completing this examination to a standard that will support any further action that may be necessitated. These are allegations. Unfortunately, the nature of the examination genuinely means it is not possible right now for me to provide a completion date but I assure the House that officials are working diligently towards its conclusion. \n Deputy Pa Daly  While it is true to say there are media reports, there has been more than that. Complaints have been made to the Department about this. While the Minister says the Department is scrutinising information, a freedom of information request revealed that, on 13 March, a draft report was furnished to the Department. This was denied by the Department in the committee last week, when it said it was an ongoing document. It says in the freedom of information document it is a draft report. For ten months, the Government has done nothing while Israeli bombs, munitions and weaponry have passed through our airspace. Every time there is a flare-up of conflict somewhere else, what is going on in Gaza is forgotten. It is unfortunate that nothing seems to be done. I am worried this report will not be furnished in the three weeks left before the recess. Will the Minister furnish the report before the middle of July? \n Deputy Darragh O'Brien  A lot has been made of the increased number of exemptions. People try to link that somewhat to the start of the conflict in the Middle East, particularly in Gaza and Israel. From October 2023, there has been an increase in exemptions granted to Irish-registered aircraft operating outside of Ireland. A substantial number of Irish aircraft operate in other territories. This increase is linked to the Scandinavian operation of the SAS Group, particularly SAS Connect, an Irish-based airline. This subsidiary of SAS Group operates a fleet of 30 aircraft with bases in Copenhagen, London, Heathrow and Stockholm. A lot of these exemptions are nothing to do with Irish sovereign territory or airspace; it is Irish-registered aircraft flying elsewhere. The type of exemptions granted are not for munitions of war at all. They can be personal, a weapon or a member of An Garda Síochána or the Defence Forces. \n Deputy Pa Daly  The Tánaiste said recently it is a real challenge to know what is going through our skies, despite all the notifications. There is clearly a draft report. Will the Minister share it with the House before the recess and let us know what is contained in it? I think most would agree we should do everything to have no part in the slaughter of medical attendants, children and others in Gaza by Israel. We cannot be complacent. We need the facts. We know there are complaints and that the Department is aware. It is not acceptable to stand idly by and wait until the beginning of September before this document is shared with the public. \n Deputy Darragh O'Brien  When serious allegations and complaints like this are made, I, as Minister, take them seriously. It behoves us to afford the time to carry out a proper investigation and interrogate the data given to us. We are in regular contract with all air operators. With Irish airspace being one of the main entry points across the Atlantic, I instructed Department officials to further remind all air carriers and operators of their responsibilities under international and domestic Irish law and of notification procedures. We receive many notifications of flight manifests and so on. I take this seriously. I mentioned media reports, and yes, complaints have been made. The people who made the complaints deserve that they be properly investigated. We will do that. I cannot give a definite timeframe for the conclusion of that work. It is important and I want to bring to a conclusion as expeditiously as possible. ",

        "extracted_answer": "Deputy Pa Daly  As the Minister probably knows, under the Air Navigation (Carriage of Munitions of War, Weapons and Dangerous Goods) Orders 1974 and 1989, it is prohibited for civil aircraft to carry munitions of war in Irish sovereign territory without being granted an exemption to do so by the Minister for Transport. Is the Minister aware of this? I presume he is. Complaints have been made that Israeli munitions are being carried. Will the Minister make a statement on the matter? \n Deputy Darragh O'Brien  I am aware of the regulations and the legislation. The Chicago convention of 1944 is the main international treaty that governs the operation of international civil aviation. Article 35 of that convention provides that no civil aircraft may carry munitions of war in the sovereign territory of a state without that state's permission. That provision is implemented in Irish law in the Air Navigation (Carriage of Munitions of War, Weapons and Dangerous Goods) Orders 1973 and 1989.  Under these orders, the carriage of munitions of war is prohibited on any civil aircraft in Irish sovereign territory unless I in my role as Minister for Transport have granted an exemption that permits it. From October 2023 to date, no applications have been received and no exemptions have been granted for the carriage of munitions of war to any point in Israel.  Any exemption granted is not a permission to carry munitions of war from one foreign state to another. It is only in respect of the operation of such a flight through Irish sovereign territory. The granting of an exemption permits entry to and exit from Irish sovereign territory. When an application for an exemption is refused, the flight must redirect.  I am aware of media reports that allege several air operators have flown through Irish sovereign territory while carrying munitions of war without the required permission. My officials have engaged in examining those allegations, communicating with the air operators concerned, collating the information and scrutinising the data gathered. We are committed to completing this examination to a standard that will support any further action that may be necessitated. These are allegations. Unfortunately, the nature of the examination genuinely means it is not possible right now for me to provide a completion date but I assure the House that officials are working diligently towards its conclusion. \n Deputy Pa Daly  While it is true to say there are media reports, there has been more than that. Complaints have been made to the Department about this. While the Minister says the Department is scrutinising information, a freedom of information request revealed that, on 13 March, a draft report was furnished to the Department. This was denied by the Department in the committee last week, when it said it was an ongoing document. It says in the freedom of information document it is a draft report. For ten months, the Government has done nothing while Israeli bombs, munitions and weaponry have passed through our airspace. Every time there is a flare-up of conflict somewhere else, what is going on in Gaza is forgotten. It is unfortunate that nothing seems to be done. I am worried this report will not be furnished in the three weeks left before the recess. Will the Minister furnish the report before the middle of July? \n Deputy Darragh O'Brien  A lot has been made of the increased number of exemptions. People try to link that somewhat to the start of the conflict in the Middle East, particularly in Gaza and Israel. From October 2023, there has been an increase in exemptions granted to Irish-registered aircraft operating outside of Ireland. A substantial number of Irish aircraft operate in other territories.

        "answerText": " Deputy Carol Nolan  I thank the Minister of State for taking this question. I am asking him provide details of the funding provided by the Department to improve the rail network and train connectivity in County Offaly in 2023, 2024 and to date in 2025. I do so because I am constantly being contacted by constituents who are very anxious to see improvements to our rail and connectivity in Offaly, particularly in Clara, which I will refer to later. \n Minister of State at the Department of Transport (Deputy Seán Canney)  I thank the Deputy for the question. As she may be aware, my Department provides public service obligation, PSO, funding for socially beneficial but financially unviable public transport services across the country. In 2023, Iarnród Éireann was allocated €187 million in PSO funding by the Department, increasing to €215 million in 2024. This is expected to further rise to €265 million this year. All of this provides for an improvement to rail passenger services. The funding has enabled Iarnród Éireann to increase the frequency of rail passenger services in County Offaly, including at Clara and Tullamore stations. I highlight the additional weekday and Sunday train services on the Dublin to Galway line, which serves Clara and Tullamore, announced in 2023 and 2024. In addition, last year, train services were added and amended to allow passengers travelling from Tullamore to Galway to avail of two weekday services arriving in Galway in advance of 9 a.m.  In terms of rail infrastructure improvements, assisted by the European Investment Bank Advisory service, the Department, the Department for Infrastructure in Northern Ireland and rail stakeholders North and South are currently examining how best to implement the recommendations of the all-island strategic rail review published in July last year. This work includes a project prioritisation strategy which is at an advanced stage of preparation. It will consider both short-term and medium-term investments on the rail network, including the Dublin to Galway line. This work is also being used to inform the Department's engagement on the review of the national development plan, which is ongoing. Funding in recent years has helped to provide the people of Offaly with a more frequent rail service. I look forward to working with Iarnród Éireann to build on this progress in the years to come. \n Deputy Carol Nolan  I welcome the Minister of State's response and the fact that €265 million has been allocated in funding this year alone. I accept there have been huge improvements in services. My question relates to the need for capital funding for a second platform at Clara train station. I brought this issue up only last week with the Minister during a debate. It would make social and economic sense in achieving balanced regional development in rural countries like Offaly, my county. I would hope there could some commitment to ensuring capital funding is put in place for a second platform, given that €265 million has been allocated this year alone. It is an easy win for the Department. It is practical, would allow further expansion of services, and would ensure users in surrounding areas like Moate, Kilbeggan and Ferbane could also avail of further services at Clara train station. \n Deputy Seán Canney  The all-island strategic rail review undertaken by the Department of Transport in co-operation with the Department for Infrastructure in Northern Ireland informs the development of rail on the island of Ireland in the coming decades up to 2050, in line with net zero targets for both jurisdictions.  The review's final report was published in 2024 and sets outs 32 strategic recommendations to enhance and expand the rail system. The EIB advisory services, the Department of Transport and the Department of infrastructure are progressing with this report's recommendations in the year ahead. As part of this project's prioritisation strategy, we will consider how best to optimise the sequencing and implementation of the review recommendations, including both short-term interventions and longer term projects.  It is important to state a project like a second platform will be one of the interim interventions that could be put in place, but we will wait to see what comes out of the EIB analysis. \n Deputy Carol Nolan  I thank the Minister of State for his response. It is certainly positive that there is a review and analysis of our infrastructure, our rail infrastructure in particular. However, I hope there would be a commitment given to the people of Offaly, especially the people of Clara who want to see further development in the town, on capital funding for a second platform. I hope also that the pace of delivery for projects like this, which are there for the taking and would contribute enormously to the expansion of existing services for minimal cost, will be stepped up. As I said, they would also help us achieve a commitment in the programme for Government, namely, balanced regional development in all our rural towns. \n Deputy Seán Canney  I agree with the Deputy. The important point is that the all-Ireland rail review is exactly that; it is about regional development, the cities, connecting the cities and connecting rural Ireland by public transport. When we are realising the recommendations of the review we need to ensure passengers are at the heart of it and have a good experience, so that when they take a train they will be happy to do so again. it is important that when we put in investment we put it in to serve all the island. That is why the review is called the all-island rail review.  I agree with the Deputy that there are opportunities for investment throughout the country to ensure the public transport we deliver is second to none. We can look at the success of the Galway-to-Limerick section of the western rail corridor. Over 630,000 passengers travel on that every year, even though when it opened a number of years ago the figure was 132,000. We have the opportunities, potential and spirit to carry on with that. ",

        "answerText": " Deputy Emer Currie  My question is whether the Minister will publish the national policy framework for unmanned aircraft systems, UAS, that is, drones, before the summer recess. As part of that, will he implement U-space regulations that have been applicable in EU states since 2023? U-space provides for the creation of a new, dedicated airspace for drones. It is essentially a traffic management system that could play a critical role when it comes to the proliferation and impact of drones flying over residential areas. \n Deputy Darragh O'Brien  As the Deputy knows, the programme for Government includes a commitment to finalise and publish a policy framework for unmanned aircraft systems, otherwise known as drones. This will guide high-level strategic planning and development of the drone sector in Ireland through supporting growth, which we want, and innovation, which we also want, while ensuring safe and secure operations and managing environmental and other concerns.  I am aware that this matter has come up in the Deputy's constituency, especially adjacent to the Blanchardstown Centre area. Work on the drafting of the policy framework has recently been finalised. When I say \"recently\" I mean I received the draft document last Friday. I am going to review that. I want to make sure I am content with it before I publish it. The policy framework sets out the vision, strategy and priorities for the development of the drone sector in Ireland. There are massive opportunities here and great benefits to it. The framework aims to guide high-level strategic planning and development of the sector in Ireland over the next decade by supporting growth and innovation, as I said. The framework also seeks to ensure safe and secure operations. Many of the issues that will be addressed by the policy framework fall directly within the remit of the Department of Transport. Some others cross over into areas of responsibility of other Departments. The policy framework has been developed through good cross-departmental engagement structures and it will be implemented through similar structures. The framework was informed by the work of an interagency steering group, its sub-working groups, a targeted stakeholder consultation held in 2022 and a public consultation in held in 2024.  The Deputy asked if I would like to get this published before the summer recess. Yes, I would. However, I want to review it properly. As I said, I only received it late last week. It will give clarity to the sector but it also highlights a lot of the benefits of the UAS sector to the general public. \n Deputy Emer Currie  I thank the Minister. It is good to see a bit of a move away from the gobbledegook that has dominated the answers I have had so far on drones. The indecipherable regulation-speak reflects the paralysis and powerlessness large sections of my community feel when they are in their homes and gardens listening to the drones above them. Dublin West is being used as a test ground for commercial drones making food deliveries. There have been 170,000 flights in the past 12 to 18 months and that figure is set to soar. There has been no direct consultation with our community and no meaningful complaint mechanism. The Irish Aviation Authority, IAA, oversees the regulations we have but those are risk-based. They have no teeth when it comes to the impact of drones on residential areas. When we build homes we do not just focus on structural specifications but their place in a community. If we want to erect a bus shelter, there is a planning process. The regulations need to be expanded urgently to cover noise, flight paths, schedules, consultation, feedback mechanisms and investment in public information, because currently it looks and sounds like a free-for-all. The U-space regulations give me the most hope for dealing with that. \n Deputy Darragh O'Brien  I have not commenced my review. I appreciate the points the Deputy has made and take them into account. I listened with interest to a vox pop in Dublin West. I think it was on FM104 last week when I was in the car. There had been complaints made by some public representatives. Then there were interviews with people on the street in Blanchardstown and many of them had different views on the matter. Having said that, this is a sector that will grow. We are seeing the benefits with respect to the delivery of medical aids, lifebuoys and other things. There are great advantages to using drones in an appropriate way. I am aware they have been used for food deliveries and other things and the Dublin West area, especially Blanchardstown, is being used as a test area. We will be informed by people's experiences there. I have not commenced reviewing this. I will, in a short space of time, review it in detail and I am happy to receive further input. We have had the public consultation and I do not intend to open it up again. We need to provide clarity on this and the use of drones. \n Deputy Emer Currie  I am aware that there are polarised views and I am also aware of the benefits. My concern is also timing. A corporate entity operating in a space without sufficient regulation will not have the duty of care to communities that is required, and we are seeing that already. A commercial operator in our area is claiming it has received 77 complaints about 170,000 flights, but I would have had that number of complaints in the past seven weeks. Companies are operating within the regulations but that does not make it right. We cannot have a situation where the horse has bolted without the legitimate concerns and rights of residents being addressed. That is just bad planning. I imagine it would have consequences under the Aarhus Convention. If U-space is the answer to getting the balance right, then the IAA needs the funding and resources to implement it now and certainly not in 2030, as some of the replies to parliamentary questions suggest.  While I have the Minister, and maybe a one-word answer would suffice, the legal barriers to DART+ West have been cleared. Will he progress the project and funding it as soon as he can? \n Deputy Paul McAuliffe  I compliment my colleague from Dublin 15. Representatives from that area have been working on the issue of drones for some time. Griffith Avenue residents have raised it on the basis that drone use is expanding to new areas. While it currently relates to food deliveries, we can only imagine the impact it would have if, for example, all parcel deliveries were to be transferred to drones in a short space of time.  The issue here is also about the planning application for the site. We have time restrictions on when we can have takeaways operating. We also need to have time restrictions on when drone deliveries of all sorts can be used. \n Deputy Darragh O'Brien  I am happy to engage with both Deputies on the issue of drones. I want to review the draft document and I will engage with them. I am sure we will be talking to the transport committee about that. This type of technology is here to stay. It is about how it interacts with our communities. There are also major benefits. The Ministers of State, Deputies Canney and Buttimer, have informed me about the use of drones in search and rescue. There are lots of good things there. With food deliveries it is generally people in the area ordering food. There are people who find it of benefit and others who find it butting in on their quality of life.  There is good news on DART+ West and the whole plan with the withdrawal of the judicial review. I want to see this project advanced as quickly as possible. I know Deputy Currie is a big supporter of it, as am I. Deputy Moynihan has an interest in DART+ South West. There is also DART+ Coastal North. The previous Government committed to DART+ in general and it went through the first approval gate. Obviously, the capital review of the NDP is critical to delivery. These projects are critical to Dublin and the greater Dublin area, and I will keep the Deputies informed of progress. ",

        "extracted_answer": "Deputy Emer Currie  My question is whether the Minister will publish the national policy framework for unmanned aircraft systems, UAS, that is, drones, before the summer recess. As part of that, will he implement U-space regulations that have been applicable in EU states since 2023? U-space provides for the creation of a new, dedicated airspace for drones. It is essentially a traffic management system that could play a critical role when it comes to the proliferation and impact of drones flying over residential areas. \n Deputy Darragh O'Brien  As the Deputy knows, the programme for Government includes a commitment to finalise and publish a policy framework for unmanned aircraft systems, otherwise known as drones. This will guide high-level strategic planning and development of the drone sector in Ireland through supporting growth, which we want, and innovation, which we also want, while ensuring safe and secure operations and managing environmental and other concerns.  I am aware that this matter has come up in the Deputy's constituency, especially adjacent to the Blanchardstown Centre area. Work on the drafting of the policy framework has recently been finalised. When I say \"recently\" I mean I received the draft document last Friday. I am going to review that. I want to make sure I am content with it before I publish it. The policy framework sets out the vision, strategy and priorities for the development of the drone sector in Ireland. There are massive opportunities here and great benefits to it. The framework aims to guide high-level strategic planning and development of the sector in Ireland over the next decade by supporting growth and innovation, as I said. The framework also seeks to ensure safe and secure operations. Many of the issues that will be addressed by the policy framework fall directly within the remit of the Department of Transport. Some others cross over into areas of responsibility of other Departments. The policy framework has been developed through good cross-departmental engagement structures and it will be implemented through similar structures. The framework was informed by the work of an interagency steering group, its sub-working groups, a targeted stakeholder consultation held in 2022 and a public consultation in held in 2024.  The Deputy asked if I would like to get this published before the summer recess. Yes, I would. However, I want to review it properly. As I said, I only received it late last week. It will give clarity to the sector but it also highlights a lot of the benefits of the UAS sector to the general public. \n Deputy Emer Currie  I thank the Minister. It is good to see a bit of a move away from the gobbledegook that has dominated the answers I have had so far on drones. The indecipherable regulation-speak reflects the paralysis and powerlessness large sections of my community feel when they are in their homes and gardens listening to the drones above them. Dublin West is being used as a test ground for commercial drones making food deliveries. There have been 170,000 flights in the past 12 to 18 months and that figure is set to soar. There has been no direct consultation with our community and no meaningful complaint mechanism. The Irish Aviation Authority, IAA, oversees the regulations we have but those are risk-based. They have no teeth when it comes to the impact of drones on residential areas. When we build homes we do not just focus on structural specifications but their place in a community. If we want to erect a bus shelter, there is a planning process. The regulations need to be expanded urgently to cover noise, flight paths, schedules, consultation, feedback mechanisms and investment in public information, because currently it looks and sounds like a free-for-all. The U-space regulations give me the most hope for dealing with that. \n Deputy Darragh O'Brien  I have not commenced my review. I appreciate the points the Deputy has made and take them into account. I listened with interest to a vox pop in Dublin West. I think it was on FM104 last week when I was in the car. There had been complaints made by some public representatives. Then there were interviews with people on the street in Blanchardstown and many of them had different views on the matter. Having said that, this is a sector that will grow. We are seeing the benefits with respect to the delivery of medical aids, lifebuoys and other things. There are great advantages to using drones in an appropriate way. I am aware they have been used for food deliveries and other things and the Dublin West area, especially Blanchardstown, is being used as a test area. We will be informed by people's experiences there. I have not commenced reviewing this. I will, in a short space of time, review it in detail and I am happy to receive further input. We have had the public consultation and I do not intend to open it up again. We need to provide clarity on this and the use of drones. \n Deputy Emer Currie  I am aware that there are polarised views and I am also aware of the benefits. My concern is also timing. A corporate entity operating in a space without sufficient regulation will not have the duty of care to communities that is required, and we are seeing that already. A commercial operator in our area is claiming it has received 77 complaints about 170,000 flights, but I would have had that number of complaints in the past seven weeks. Companies are operating within the regulations but that does not make it right. We cannot have a situation where the horse has bolted without the legitimate concerns and rights of residents being addressed. That is just bad planning. I imagine it would have consequences under the Aarhus Convention. If U-space is the answer to getting the balance right, then the IAA needs the funding and resources to implement it now and certainly not in 2030, as some of the replies to parliamentary questions suggest.  While I have the Minister, and maybe a one-word answer would suffice, the legal barriers to DART+ West have been cleared. Will he progress the project and funding it as soon as he can? \n Deputy Paul McAuliffe  I compliment my colleague from Dublin 15. Representatives from that area have been working on the issue of drones for some time. Griffith Avenue residents have raised it on the basis that drone use is expanding to new areas. While it currently relates to food deliveries, we can only imagine the impact it would have if, for example, all parcel deliveries were to be transferred to drones in a short space of time.  The issue here is also about the planning application for the site. We have time restrictions on when we can have takeaways operating. We also need to have time restrictions on when drone deliveries of all sorts can be used. \n Deputy Darragh O'Brien  I am happy to engage with both Deputies on the issue of drones.

        "answerText": " Deputy William Aird  I ask the Government to include both the Portlaoise northern orbital route and the Mountmellick bypass in the revised national development plan. They are not just local road projects; they are critical infrastructure with regional and national significance. As the Minister of State knows, Portlaoise is one of Ireland's fastest growing towns. The town is already under pressure from traffic congestion with heavy volumes of vehicles passing through daily. The northern orbital route has long been identified as a key priority to ease congestion in the town centre, improve road safety and enhance the quality of life for residents and businesses. \n Deputy Jerry Buttimer  I thank the Deputy for the question and for his ongoing advocacy for his county of Laois. The Government has earmarked approximately €5.1 billion for investment in new national roads projects between 2021 and 2030 and a further €2.9 billion for the protection and renewal of the network. I can confirm that approximately €600 million of Exchequer capital funding was provided to local authorities through TII for national roads in 2025.  Regarding the Mountmellick bypass, in 2022 Laois County Council concluded the preliminary appraisal of options process in relation to a bypass of the town. However, a proposed bypass of Mountmellick, unfortunately for Deputy Aird, is not included among the projects that are identified for development during current NDP and therefore, it was not possible to advance the proposed project at that time.  The Portlaoise northern orbital route project was originally proposed during the 2000s and was to be funded by private developers at the time. However, following the subsequent recession and the funding stream no longer being available, the project was not progressed. While it is referenced by Laois County Council in its draft local area plan, it was not included in the current NDP due to issues of funding.  With regard to the progression of projects such as these, it is important to point out to the Deputy and the House that it is for the local authority, in the first instance, to engage with TII. I assure the Deputy that Department of Transport officials and TII will give any proposal for the progression of these projects full consideration. All projects, including those listed in the NDP or any revision to the NDP, require statutory approval and compliance with the infrastructure guidelines. The programme for Government contains a commitment to increase funding for new roads as part of the NDP review. This would include funding for town bypasses, such as those outlined by Deputy Aird, which improve regional connectivity and promote compact growth in our town centres. Work is currently under way within the Department of Transport to contribute to the review of the NDP, with input from TII and other agencies. \n Deputy William Aird  We do not need consideration; we need money. This road is vital to redirect HGVs coming from Rosslare to the west of Ireland. We are trying move this traffic away from residential areas, schools and hospitals. This route is also essential to future-proof Portlaoise for sustainable growth under the national planning framework. Without this orbital route, development is hindered, traffic continues to choke the town and emissions increase. It is clear that inclusion of the Portlaoise northern orbital route in the revised national development plan is needed now.  The bypass needed in Mountmellick is equally important. Mountmellick has suffered severe traffic bottlenecks for years especially during the school rush hour. This is more than an inconvenience; it is a safety issue. The main streets in Mountmellick were never designed to carry the present volume or weight of traffic, including articulated lorries and agricultural machinery. The lack of a bypass affects the town's viability, slows economic development and poses safety risks to pedestrians and cyclists. It also affects regional connectivity, which we spoke about, between Tullamore, Portlaoise and surrounding areas. A Mountmellick bypass has been on the agenda for decades. It is time to move it into action. \n Deputy Jerry Buttimer  I again thank the Deputy for raising the matter. He makes pertinent points about the orbital route and the traffic congestion. I remind him that Laois County Council received an allocation of more than €1.1 million this year for protection and renewal of the county's road network. With regard to the N80 road safety improvement project in Portlaoise town, including the Mountmellick Road and James Fintan Lalor Avenue, a technical adviser has been appointed, and a feasibility and options report seeking funding for the project is underway. TII is awaiting a submissions report and anticipates that Laois County Council will submit a report seeking funding by the end of this year. On the Stradbally N80 pavement project, tenders are being assessed and it is expected that works will be completed later this year. I remind Deputy Aird and Members that it is up to any council, including Laois County Council, to submit and engage with TII on the review of the NDP. I encourage it to do that, and I am happy to work with the Deputy on the matter. However, he raises valid and pertinent points this evening. \n Deputy William Aird  These two projects must be included in the revised national development plan to address fair regional development, align with national goals, reduce emissions, promote balanced regional development and support active travel and safer roads. The Portlaoise northern orbital route and the Mountmellick bypass projects would complement existing investment in the region's rail network. I urge the Minister of State to work with these county councils and Transport Infrastructure Ireland to ensure that the Portlaoise northern orbital route and the Mountmellick bypass are fully recognised and funded within the revised NDP.  When I was a councillor, I sat in Laois County Council during the previous NDP plan, and we were not included. We got nothing out of it. We were told the plan was closed for ten years, but because there was a general election that envelope was opened up. I assure the Minister of State that now that I am a TD, I will make sure these projects are in it. When the Minister, Deputy O'Brien, came off at junction 17 recently, he saw the road that goes down through the business park and travels solely to the west of Ireland. Not one shilling did it get from the former Minister, Eamon Ryan. I pleaded with him to give us money, but not a fivepenny piece did he give us for that. We funded that out of our own coffers in Laois County Council, so the Minister owes it to us to put us into that national development plan. \n Deputy Jerry Buttimer  I hear loud and clear Deputy Aird's advocacy for the importance of this route. I remind him that this Government under the Minister, Deputy O'Brien, the Minister of State, Deputy Canney, and I has seen a further €2.9 million for the protection and renewal of the road network and we are investing €1 billion in new national road projects over the coming decade. I also say regarding the NDP review that it is up to all local authorities to work with TII and the Department to ensure projects get consideration. I hear the Deputy on sustainability and the issue of traffic gridlock and road safety, but the programme for Government contains a commitment to increase funding for new roads as part of the NDP review, as I have said. That is about ensuring we see town bypasses completed and we see work continue and carried out on regional connectivity. Deputy Aird has made a good point tonight. I am sure the advocacy work that he is doing and will continue to do will be well received in the Department. We hear the Deputy tonight, but I remind him that the two road projects I have listed are under way. Laois County Council has appointed a technical adviser and tenders are being assessed. It is important that Laois County Council engages in the NDP review. \n Deputy William Aird  I thank the Minister of State for that. ",

It is a fantastic project that makes a lot of sense, with 4 km and four stops connecting it to an existing line that will give access to thousands of people in my constituency. We are one of the few constituencies in the country that does not have rail services. We are entirely reliant on bus services. However, we hope the Finglas Luas will come out of planning this year, and we want to make sure that next year it goes to construction. \n Deputy Darragh O'Brien  The Deputy knows this project well. It is one of four proposed Luas tram extensions that have been identified by the NTA as part of the current statutory transport strategy for the greater Dublin area. This project is 3.9 km, just short of 4 km, but still extensive as it would extend the Dublin tram network from Broombridge to Finglas.  This is eminently doable. The route will serve an estimated population of 56,000 by 2035 at four new stops, namely, St. Helena’s, Finglas village, St. Margaret’s Road and Charlestown. The Deputy has been a strong advocate for this and continues to be. The project will serve people beyond those communities through interchanges with the bus network and with rail services at Broombridge train station, which is on the planned DART+ West line. In addition, the project provides for a 350-vehicle park-and-ride facility at the St. Margaret’s Road stop, close to the M50-M2 interchange.  Transport Infrastructure Ireland, as the sponsoring agency, prepared the preliminary business case for Luas Finglas, while the NTA, as the day-to-day approving authority, approved it for submission to the Department of Transport. In October 2024, the Government approved the project at approval gate 1 of the infrastructure guidelines. That was a very significant step. TII did not delay. The following month, it lodged a railway order application with An Bord Pleanála. I am pleased to say I understand the board has recently confirmed that a decision will be made before 30 September 2025. It is not often the board comes out with a definitive date like that. That in itself is very significant.  Should the railway order be granted, the NTA will need to provide my Department with a procurement strategy for Luas Finglas, as is normal, under the infrastructure guidelines. Following ministerial approval, the project can enter the procurement stage. Subject to the planning decision, this project will be transformational for residents of the Deputy's constituency and the surrounding area, who will be able to link through the other networks. \n Deputy Paul McAuliffe  It is very welcome that we will have a planning decision by 30 September. The Minister is right that the decision to bring it to the Cabinet for gate 1 was really important. The Minister, Deputy Lawless, really assisted us in doing that. He came on site and examined the potential of it. I was pleased the Cabinet signed off on that.  Almost all the Luas projects that have happened have gone through the planning and procurement phase in one five-year cycle and in the second five years they have been constructed and delivered. That is where we need to focus now. We are looking beyond planning and procurement to the potential of the site. It has the potential to unlock more housing in the area, which is crucial. When we built Finglas west and Finglas south, there was a line through the middle of it. That line was intended for a railway project many decades ago. While this is being prioritised, there is a legacy here. This will deliver for our constituency. I want to ensure the Minister is aware of it, which he is, and that we keep the pressure on the NTA and TII to deliver it. \n Deputy Darragh O'Brien  I have been many times in the Deputy's constituency and in Finglas. I want to see this project move forward to construction and delivery. We have a couple of hurdles but not big ones. We have to get through planning. Should that be granted, there is then the procurement strategy for Luas Finglas under the infrastructure guidelines. Ministerial approval will follow that and the project can then enter the procurement stage. As is the case with all projects, this will go through Government consent and must receive approval at gate 3.  The project has a lot going for it. The construction is relatively simple for the very reason the Deputy highlighted. The railway corridor is there. The population and housing have developed around it and will allow us to develop more. Transport-oriented development is what we want for new homes and businesses.  I await with interest the decision prior to 30 September and look forward to working with the Deputy directly to deliver this project for Finglas. \n Deputy Paul McAuliffe  Gabhaim buíochas leis an Aire. I see we are making good progress on that. We will keep a watchful eye and ensure it continues. Many people on the other side of the constituency will hope for the delivery of the metro project with the same urgency. It is a far more complex and detailed project but one that has been promised for some time. The review of the national development plan is happening in the next couple of weeks. Those two key projects in my constituency are really important, along with the BusConnects projects. The core bus corridors are the quickest and easiest ways to deliver better public transport in our areas. The network design was not uncontroversial and there was a great deal of input from people. I still have issues with certain elements of it but the core bus corridors will be important in providing high-frequency access. Those are my three asks. I wish the Minister the best of luck in his portfolio. It is the first time I have had the opportunity to ask him questions on it. I look forward to working with him on it. \n Deputy Shane Moynihan  I congratulate my colleague, Deputy McAuliffe, on his advocacy for Finglas Luas. The Minister will know Luas Lucan is very important to me. I am keen to know about the overall set of plans identified by the NTA for extension of Luas lines around Dublin. Will he consider putting a standing Luas project office in place to think of continued expansion of light rail? It is fair to say we have developed an expertise in the construction of light rail. We do it well, on time and in budget. We have a real opportunity to build a comparative advantage so it might be worth considering for the future. \n Deputy Darragh O'Brien  That point is a very good one. TII has built up excellent expertise and knowledge in delivery of those projects. Expansion of the Luas network needs to be looked at in the round and that is being done. Deputy McAuliffe mentioned MetroLink and we expect that to come out of planning with a final decision - not a draft decision - in the month of July. That would be a transformational project for the north Dublin area from the airport right into the city through Ballymun, and indeed beyond. The challenge and opportunity for the Government and everyone in the House is that many of these projects are now coming through planning, including DART+ South West, DART+ West + and DART+ Coastal North. All of those projects will be coming through. Moreover, BusConnects will start this year. Twelve projects have come through An Bord Pleanála. Four or five of them are unencumbered by judicial review. I have two tenders back in already. We expect to award a contract on the first one, which will see construction on the first BusConnects corridor happening this year. That is what the public wants to see. It wants to see investment in public transport infrastructure - bus, rail, Luas and metro. ",

At the outset, it is important to distinguish between publicly subvented services , which operate under contract with the National Transport Authority, and commercial services , which are operated under licence from the NTA and do not receive State subvention.

The NTA is responsible for issuing licences for these commercial services. Each licence sets out specific conditions, like where the service runs from and to, what stops it makes, and the timetable it must follow.  Bus Éireann has informed us that while most Expressway routes have remained operational this year, a small number of services have unfortunately been cancelled in recent months. This has largely been down to fleet availability. I am assured they are working hard to address these issues and are closely monitoring the situation, particularly along the Dublin-Wicklow-Wexford corridor, to maintain reliability for passengers as best they can. Additionally, I have been informed of the enhancement of services on this particular route by Bus Éireann to provide more frequent and punctual travel for all Route 2 customers.

        "answerText": " Deputy Naoise Ó Cearúil  We have seen the extension of contactless fare payments in cities such as London, Edinburgh, Barcelona and Milan, as well as in the Netherlands. I am looking for the expected timeline for the roll-out of contactless fare payments on all public transport. \n Deputy Darragh O'Brien  I propose to take Questions Nos. 97, 98 and 102 together.  I thank an Teachta Ó Cearúil. For background, the next generation ticketing project, led by the NTA, is for a new, modern public transport ticketing system that will facilitate a variety of payment methods for passengers, including contactless.  In April 2024, the NTA with Government approval entered into a multiyear framework agreement for next generation ticketing with Indra Sistemas S.A. to deliver this project. The initial focus is on the greater Dublin area and it will be rolled out across four phases. This is a major, complex project, with a capital cost of over €160 million - €160 million in Exchequer funds is being invested in this project - to implement it in the greater Dublin area alone, covering the costs of the enabling works to install new equipment for transport operators and the costs for the NTA team delivery team overseeing the project.  Phase 1 of the project in the greater Dublin area is due to launch in summer 2027. I am happy to be able to give that date. We will need to keep a close eye on the progress being made. That will be significant because it will test contactless payment on a small number of new validators or ticket machines. Phase 2 will be ready for summer 2028, allowing passengers on Dublin Bus and Luas services to use the next generation ticketing technology, including contactless payments on validators.  The NTA and Indra are currently planning phase 3, which is implementation across Iarnród Éireann's train services, and phase 4, which is implementation on commuter bus services in and out of Dublin. The NTA will be in a better position to provide timelines once planning is complete.  The timelines are not bad. It is summer 2027 for phase 1. I would like to see that shortening for phases 2, 3 and 4. The fundamental thing is to get the IT system in place. This will be account-based as well. It will be better than the system in Britain, which people might be used to if they use tap-on and tap-off, because they will also be able to have accounts. I am interrogating those timelines.  This would be transformative for our transport system across all bus, rail, Luas and DART services. In the meantime, and as an interim measure, Iarnród Eireann already provides for passengers to download a QR code to their phone, removing the need for a physical ticket on longer journeys. Obviously, we have the Leap card as well, which I use. In addition, the NTA's barcode-based app, TFI Go, already allows customers to buy a range of tickets for bus services outside Dublin, including on all Bus Éireann public service obligation services, Dublin commuter routes operated by Go-Ahead Ireland and all local link rural services nationwide. As part of the young adult fares scheme, 27 private bus operators already sell their tickets on the TFI Go app.  It is good news that this is being advanced. It is a significant investment on behalf of our people, but it is a critical project. I am not at all questioning the complexities involved, but I want to interrogate those timelines further. If we can get phase 1 going by summer 2027, I would be content with that. However, I am not sure I want to wait until summer 2028 for phase 2. I do not yet have timeframes for phases 3 and 4. I will meet with the NTA to discuss this matter shortly. I have already met with the NTA a number of times in respect of it. The Government is committed to this. I want to see it in place; done correctly, obviously, and in a timely fashion. \n Deputy Naoise Ó Cearúil  The Minister has announced extremely positive news here this evening that is extremely welcome. It would be great to see a breakdown of the timelines. What do we need to do in order to get to the first phase in the summer of 2027? Is there a need for procurement of IT systems? Are particular systems for buses, etc., required? It would be great to see the routes included in phase 1 as well. Would it be possible to expedite those later phases? We have to wait until the summer of 2028 for phase 2. Phase 3 relates to Iarnród Éireann and phase 4 relates to commuter buses. Obviously, the vast majority of people who commute to Dublin, particularly from Kildare North, do so by bus or rail. If we could get a breakdown to ensure we meet those timelines and to see if they could be expedited it would be very beneficial. \n Deputy Joe Neville  Can we get a contactless payment system in the interim? Obviously, the timelines have been highlighted. It might be another two, three or four years before things happen. Could we look at putting in place an interim measure that whereby people could use app to make contactless payments? Coming from north Kildare, it does not seem reasonable that we should expect it to take three or four years. \n Deputy Darragh O'Brien  Deputy Neville may have missed the final part of my answer. TFI has the TFI Go app in place, and we have Leap cards as an interim measure as well. The point is taken, however. Many of the resources will be used in implementing this new system. Obviously, some will be used to design it but most will be used to implement it. I have a more detailed breakdown of the major release phases. Phase 1, which, as I mentioned, is scheduled for summer 2027, will introduce a small number of new ticketing machines for a combination of bus, tram and train services. That is to test and improve the functionality of the validators. It is right and proper that this is done before committing to a larger scale development.  We then get to the major release 2, assuming the test phase of the major release 1 works well. This involves installing new validators, initially across the Dublin city bus and Luas networks. This will take some time to complete, which is fair enough, and will involve replacing all of the validators on 1,300-plus buses and approximately 400 validators across 69 stops in the tram network. I understand there is a complexity involved , particularly when you are keeping Leap cards, free travel and all of the existing measures in place, such as the TFI Go app and others I mentioned. You are introducing a new system while you are operating the existing one.  Effectively, you then move into major release 3, which brings in Iarnród Éireann, or Irish Rail. That is a separate release owing to the specific complexity of installing and removing station gates. This will involve quite a lot of physical work on our rail network. In major release 4, the NTA will extend contactless bank card payments and barcode tickets to commuter and other bus services in the Dublin commuter zone. There are four phases, as I have stated, and four different releases. I will be meeting the NTA on this to see if there is any way we can shrink the timelines. However, it is welcome that it will start in summer 2027. \n Deputy Naoise Ó Cearúil  As I said, this is extremely positive news. It is great to see such a development. Indra Sistemas, which is carrying out the work, has done similar work previously in an international context. Are there any binding milestones built into the contract? The reason I ask is because there are four phases, which is excellent, and we can see clear steps to achieve the overarching aim, but the priority should be to ensure that everything is delivered on time and within budget. Could we get an understanding of the contractual arrangements with Indra Sistemas?  It goes without saying that there are more vulnerable users, older people in particular, who would like to continue to use cash. It is important to ensure that option is still available for those people and for those who prefer to use cash.  I thank the Minister for his work on this. It has been a priority for him, and it is great to see progress here so far. \n Deputy Joe Neville  The reason I bring up contactless payments is because I commute from north Kildare. As someone who has used buses and trains over years, I have seen the improvements in the public transport system. At the same time, contactless payments are something we have seen in many other countries and cities. A lot of people would have used them in different places. I see no reason Dublin and Ireland should be any different. That is the reason I tabled my question, but I also wanted to speak to an interim measure we could use. We all use our Leap cards, we all update them on the app and we all update our payments, but, sooner rather than later, it should be a simple case of being able to tap and go. Obviously, it will be a costly and complex exercise but we will need simple steps in place in order that we can identify the costs along the way, how they are orientated and whether the projects are hitting their targets within the timeline. I am very happy that contactless payments are a key focus for the Minister. Hopefully, we look to them being delivered in the near future. The sooner we get an interim measure in place, the better it will be for everyone. \n Deputy Darragh O'Brien  I thank both Deputies for their support. I will meet the NTA and Indra Sistemas, which is developing this system. I will try to secure more specific timelines from the company. It has been very helpful so far. Work is progressing very well. On the contractual arrangements, I do not have that detail right now. I commit to reverting to both Deputies with an update on this after I meet with the NTA and Indra Sistemas.  If we look at other innovations that have taken place, the Leap card was a big step forward from what we had before. The 90-minute fare is very useful. The interaction of the Leap card between all of our transport operators as well is useful. It is not too many years ago that this option was not available to people. Thankfully, because this Government is still committed to free travel for our seniors, there will be no requirement for cash payments for most of them. As the Deputies know, a commitment made by the previous Government and this one is that people with free travel will be able to bring a companion with them, and it is being rolled out right now. Later this year, probably in September, we will bring forward free travel for those between the ages of five and eight. The purpose of this is to recognise that costs are high too for families.

        "extracted_answer": "Deputy Naoise Ó Cearúil  We have seen the extension of contactless fare payments in cities such as London, Edinburgh, Barcelona and Milan, as well as in the Netherlands. I am looking for the expected timeline for the roll-out of contactless fare payments on all public transport. \n Deputy Darragh O'Brien  I propose to take Questions Nos. 97, 98 and 102 together.  I thank an Teachta Ó Cearúil. For background, the next generation ticketing project, led by the NTA, is for a new, modern public transport ticketing system that will facilitate a variety of payment methods for passengers, including contactless.  In April 2024, the NTA with Government approval entered into a multiyear framework agreement for next generation ticketing with Indra Sistemas S.A. to deliver this project. The initial focus is on the greater Dublin area and it will be rolled out across four phases. This is a major, complex project, with a capital cost of over €160 million - €160 million in Exchequer funds is being invested in this project - to implement it in the greater Dublin area alone, covering the costs of the enabling works to install new equipment for transport operators and the costs for the NTA team delivery team overseeing the project.  Phase 1 of the project in the greater Dublin area is due to launch in summer 2027. I am happy to be able to give that date. We will need to keep a close eye on the progress being made. That will be significant because it will test contactless payment on a small number of new validators or ticket machines. Phase 2 will be ready for summer 2028, allowing passengers on Dublin Bus and Luas services to use the next generation ticketing technology, including contactless payments on validators.  The NTA and Indra are currently planning phase 3, which is implementation across Iarnród Éireann's train services, and phase 4, which is implementation on commuter bus services in and out of Dublin. The NTA will be in a better position to provide timelines once planning is complete.  The timelines are not bad. It is summer 2027 for phase 1. I would like to see that shortening for phases 2, 3 and 4. The fundamental thing is to get the IT system in place. This will be account-based as well. It will be better than the system in Britain, which people might be used to if they use tap-on and tap-off, because they will also be able to have accounts. I am interrogating those timelines.  This would be transformative for our transport system across all bus, rail, Luas and DART services. In the meantime, and as an interim measure, Iarnród Eireann already provides for passengers to download a QR code to their phone, removing the need for a physical ticket on longer journeys. Obviously, we have the Leap card as well, which I use. In addition, the NTA's barcode-based app, TFI Go, already allows customers to buy a range of tickets for bus services outside Dublin, including on all Bus Éireann public service obligation services, Dublin commuter routes operated by Go-Ahead Ireland and all local link rural services nationwide. As part of the young adult fares scheme, 27 private bus operators already sell their tickets on the TFI Go app.  It is good news that this is being advanced. It is a significant investment on behalf of our people, but it is a critical project. I am not at all questioning the complexities involved, but I want to interrogate those timelines further. If we can get phase 1 going by summer 2027, I would be content with that. However, I am not sure I want to wait until summer 2028 for phase 2. I do not yet have timeframes for phases 3 and 4. I will meet with the NTA to discuss this matter shortly. I have already met with the NTA a number of times in respect of it. The Government is committed to this. I want to see it in place; done correctly, obviously, and in a timely fashion. \n Deputy Naoise Ó Cearúil  The Minister has announced extremely positive news here this evening that is extremely welcome. It would be great to see a breakdown of the timelines. What do we need to do in order to get to the first phase in the summer of 2027? Is there a need for procurement of IT systems? Are particular systems for buses, etc., required? It would be great to see the routes included in phase 1 as well. Would it be possible to expedite those later phases? We have to wait until the summer of 2028 for phase 2. Phase 3 relates to Iarnród Éireann and phase 4 relates to commuter buses. Obviously, the vast majority of people who commute to Dublin, particularly from Kildare North, do so by bus or rail. If we could get a breakdown to ensure we meet those timelines and to see if they could be expedited it would be very beneficial. \n Deputy Joe Neville  Can we get a contactless payment system in the interim? Obviously, the timelines have been highlighted. It might be another two, three or four years before things happen. Could we look at putting in place an interim measure that whereby people could use app to make contactless payments? Coming from north Kildare, it does not seem reasonable that we should expect it to take three or four years. \n Deputy Darragh O'Brien  Deputy Neville may have missed the final part of my answer. TFI has the TFI Go app in place, and we have Leap cards as an interim measure as well. The point is taken, however. Many of the resources will be used in implementing this new system. Obviously, some will be used to design it but most will be used to implement it. I have a more detailed breakdown of the major release phases. Phase 1, which, as I mentioned, is scheduled for summer 2027, will introduce a small number of new ticketing machines for a combination of bus, tram and train services. That is to test and improve the functionality of the validators. It is right and proper that this is done before committing to a larger scale development.  We then get to the major release 2, assuming the test phase of the major release 1 works well. This involves installing new validators, initially across the Dublin city bus and Luas networks. This will take some time to complete, which is fair enough, and will involve replacing all of the validators on 1,300-plus buses and approximately 400 validators across 69 stops in the tram network. I understand there is a complexity involved , particularly when you are keeping Leap cards, free travel and all of the existing measures in place, such as the TFI Go app and others I mentioned. You are introducing a new system while you are operating the existing one.  Effectively, you then move into major release 3, which brings in Iarnród Éireann, or Irish Rail. That is a separate release owing to the specific complexity of installing and removing station gates. This will involve quite a lot of physical work on our rail network. In major release 4, the NTA will extend contactless bank card payments and barcode tickets to commuter and other bus services in the Dublin commuter zone. There are four phases, as I have stated, and four different releases. I will be meeting the NTA on this to see if there is any way we can shrink the timelines. However, it is welcome that it will start in summer 2027. \n Deputy Naoise Ó Cearúil  As I said, this is extremely positive news. It is great to see such a development. Indra Sistemas, which is carrying out the work, has done similar work previously in an international context. Are there any binding milestones built into the contract?

It will be better than the system in Britain, which people might be used to if they use tap-on and tap-off, because they will also be able to have accounts. I am interrogating those timelines.  This would be transformative for our transport system across all bus, rail, Luas and DART services. In the meantime, and as an interim measure, Iarnród Eireann already provides for passengers to download a QR code to their phone, removing the need for a physical ticket on longer journeys. Obviously, we have the Leap card as well, which I use. In addition, the NTA's barcode-based app, TFI Go, already allows customers to buy a range of tickets for bus services outside Dublin, including on all Bus Éireann public service obligation services, Dublin commuter routes operated by Go-Ahead Ireland and all local link rural services nationwide. As part of the young adult fares scheme, 27 private bus operators already sell their tickets on the TFI Go app.  It is good news that this is being advanced. It is a significant investment on behalf of our people, but it is a critical project. I am not at all questioning the complexities involved, but I want to interrogate those timelines further. If we can get phase 1 going by summer 2027, I would be content with that. However, I am not sure I want to wait until summer 2028 for phase 2. I do not yet have timeframes for phases 3 and 4. I will meet with the NTA to discuss this matter shortly. I have already met with the NTA a number of times in respect of it. The Government is committed to this. I want to see it in place; done correctly, obviously, and in a timely fashion. \n Deputy Naoise Ó Cearúil  The Minister has announced extremely positive news here this evening that is extremely welcome. It would be great to see a breakdown of the timelines. What do we need to do in order to get to the first phase in the summer of 2027? Is there a need for procurement of IT systems? Are particular systems for buses, etc., required? It would be great to see the routes included in phase 1 as well. Would it be possible to expedite those later phases? We have to wait until the summer of 2028 for phase 2. Phase 3 relates to Iarnród Éireann and phase 4 relates to commuter buses. Obviously, the vast majority of people who commute to Dublin, particularly from Kildare North, do so by bus or rail. If we could get a breakdown to ensure we meet those timelines and to see if they could be expedited it would be very beneficial. \n Deputy Joe Neville  Can we get a contactless payment system in the interim? Obviously, the timelines have been highlighted. It might be another two, three or four years before things happen. Could we look at putting in place an interim measure that whereby people could use app to make contactless payments? Coming from north Kildare, it does not seem reasonable that we should expect it to take three or four years. \n Deputy Darragh O'Brien  Deputy Neville may have missed the final part of my answer. TFI has the TFI Go app in place, and we have Leap cards as an interim measure as well. The point is taken, however. Many of the resources will be used in implementing this new system. Obviously, some will be used to design it but most will be used to implement it. I have a more detailed breakdown of the major release phases. Phase 1, which, as I mentioned, is scheduled for summer 2027, will introduce a small number of new ticketing machines for a combination of bus, tram and train services. That is to test and improve the functionality of the validators. It is right and proper that this is done before committing to a larger scale development.  We then get to the major release 2, assuming the test phase of the major release 1 works well. This involves installing new validators, initially across the Dublin city bus and Luas networks. This will take some time to complete, which is fair enough, and will involve replacing all of the validators on 1,300-plus buses and approximately 400 validators across 69 stops in the tram network. I understand there is a complexity involved , particularly when you are keeping Leap cards, free travel and all of the existing measures in place, such as the TFI Go app and others I mentioned. You are introducing a new system while you are operating the existing one.  Effectively, you then move into major release 3, which brings in Iarnród Éireann, or Irish Rail. That is a separate release owing to the specific complexity of installing and removing station gates. This will involve quite a lot of physical work on our rail network. In major release 4, the NTA will extend contactless bank card payments and barcode tickets to commuter and other bus services in the Dublin commuter zone. There are four phases, as I have stated, and four different releases. I will be meeting the NTA on this to see if there is any way we can shrink the timelines. However, it is welcome that it will start in summer 2027. \n Deputy Naoise Ó Cearúil  As I said, this is extremely positive news. It is great to see such a development. Indra Sistemas, which is carrying out the work, has done similar work previously in an international context. Are there any binding milestones built into the contract? The reason I ask is because there are four phases, which is excellent, and we can see clear steps to achieve the overarching aim, but the priority should be to ensure that everything is delivered on time and within budget. Could we get an understanding of the contractual arrangements with Indra Sistemas?  It goes without saying that there are more vulnerable users, older people in particular, who would like to continue to use cash. It is important to ensure that option is still available for those people and for those who prefer to use cash.  I thank the Minister for his work on this. It has been a priority for him, and it is great to see progress here so far. \n Deputy Joe Neville  The reason I bring up contactless payments is because I commute from north Kildare. As someone who has used buses and trains over years, I have seen the improvements in the public transport system. At the same time, contactless payments are something we have seen in many other countries and cities. A lot of people would have used them in different places. I see no reason Dublin and Ireland should be any different. That is the reason I tabled my question, but I also wanted to speak to an interim measure we could use. We all use our Leap cards, we all update them on the app and we all update our payments, but, sooner rather than later, it should be a simple case of being able to tap and go. Obviously, it will be a costly and complex exercise but we will need simple steps in place in order that we can identify the costs along the way, how they are orientated and whether the projects are hitting their targets within the timeline. I am very happy that contactless payments are a key focus for the Minister. Hopefully, we look to them being delivered in the near future. The sooner we get an interim measure in place, the better it will be for everyone. \n Deputy Darragh O'Brien  I thank both Deputies for their support. I will meet the NTA and Indra Sistemas, which is developing this system. I will try to secure more specific timelines from the company. It has been very helpful so far. Work is progressing very well. On the contractual arrangements, I do not have that detail right now. I commit to reverting to both Deputies with an update on this after I meet with the NTA and Indra Sistemas.  If we look at other innovations that have taken place, the Leap card was a big step forward from what we had before. The 90-minute fare is very useful. The interaction of the Leap card between all of our transport operators as well is useful. It is not too many years ago that this option was not available to people. Thankfully, because this Government is still committed to free travel for our seniors, there will be no requirement for cash payments for most of them. As the Deputies know, a commitment made by the previous Government and this one is that people with free travel will be able to bring a companion with them, and it is being rolled out right now. Later this year, probably in September, we will bring forward free travel for those between the ages of five and eight. The purpose of this is to recognise that costs are high too for families. We also want kids who are using buses, etc., to get used to doing so in order that it becomes a habit. We had record public transport passenger journeys last year. We want to try to exceed that this year. People are responding in that regard right across urban and rural locations. The Minister of State, Deputy Buttimer, answered questions about the advancement of Local Link. That has been really significant.  We have a great deal of work to do in this space, but real progress has been made. I will keep Deputies Neville and Ó Cearúil up to date. I will revert to them, post my meeting with the NTA, with specific timelines.",
        "formatted_question": "Is there a plan to explore an interim payment method, such as a mobile app, for public transport until contactless payments are available?",
        "formatted_answer": "The National Transport Authority (NTA) is leading a project to modernize public transport ticketing, which includes implementing contactless payments. A framework agreement with Indra Sistemas S.A. began in April 2024. The project is divided into four phases, with Phase 1 scheduled for summer 2027, focusing on testing in the greater Dublin area. Subsequent phases will expand contactless payments across the country by 2028. Existing interim solutions include the TFI Go app and Leap cards. The Minister is committed to the project and will provide updates after consulting with the NTA and Indra."

        "answerText": " Deputy John Clendennen  Will the Minister of State give some information to the House on the take-up of EV charging schemes for sports clubs, community facilities and town and village residents, and will he make a statement on the matter? \n Deputy Seán Canney  I thank the Deputy very much for the question. The Government is fully committed to tackling climate action with practical, innovative solutions that support our economy, communities and future generations. Promoting EVs is a central pillar of our strategy to reduce transport emissions, along with proposals to increase the use of active travel and public transport, reduce overall car usage and increase the mix of sustainable biofuels in the petrol and diesel fuel blends. Having an effective and reliable charging network is an essential part of enabling drivers to make the switch to EVs. While over 80% of charging is expected to happen at home, there is an absolute need for a seamless public charging network that will provide for situations or instances where home charging is not possible.  The regional and local EV charging network plan was launched in April this year and sets targets and strategies for local authorities to drive EV infrastructure development at destination and neighbourhood locations, with Government support. This plan will help deliver the charging infrastructure people need, where they need it, at home, on the road and at key destinations and neighbourhoods across communities.  The shared island funded sports club EV charging infrastructure scheme was officially launched in February 2023 with an allocation of €15 million. The aim of the scheme is to install a network of publicly accessible chargers in communities throughout the country, through their local sports clubs. The scheme was advertised both generally and through recognised national governing bodies for individual sports. Over 220 clubs across the island met the eligibility criteria to continue to the next phase. The next phase has been to procure charge point operators to undertake the works required. This is well advanced and announcements on this will be made in the coming weeks. This will enable sports clubs to engage with the selected CPOs to agree on works to be done and commence the draw-down of the funding. \n Deputy John Clendennen  Many of the community groups that pursued the initiative did so as part of a revenue-generating initiative, but there has been frustration. The Minister of State referred to some of the schemes but there are others that go back as far as July 2023, when expressions of interest would have been sought. These are ongoing. It takes more than two years to get an EV charging station installed at a community centre. There is frustration over how long it takes and the burden of administration. Rather than examining how we deliver the infrastructure, we need to examine the timeframe of delivery and place a serious onus on the agencies and scheme operators to deliver in a much shorter space of time than at present.  In town and village centres, the local authorities have to step up to the mark. Householders on streetscapes that have no access to a connection are frustrated. In other countries, streetlight poles have been used in this regard, and that is one of the initiatives we should be considering. \n Deputy Seán Canney  I agree that the time it takes to put these things in place is not what we would like.  The EU JTF EV charging scheme provides funding to support EV infrastructure at community facilities in the just transition area in the midlands. These include community centres, public libraries, public health centres, recreational facilities and enterprise centres in counties Laois, Longford, Offaly, Westmeath and Roscommon and the municipal districts of Ballinasloe, Athy, Clane-Maynooth, Carrick-on-Suir and Thurles. Ninety-three facilities have met the initial eligibility criteria. All site assessments have now been completed and the process to confirm their viability is now under way.  In addition, Zero Emission Vehicles Ireland, ZEVI, has developed a local authority EV charging infrastructure pilot scheme. This scheme has approximately 26 pilot projects across 15 local authorities. I will open the first of these on 27 June in Galway city. This co-ordinated pilot programme focuses on EV charging for multiple users’ needs predominantly at destination, neighbourhood and tourist locations.  The Department is also funding dedicated EV charging infrastructure officers in each local authority to co-ordinate the roll-out of the infrastructure. \n Deputy John Clendennen  The Minister of State mentioned the EU JTF. This is a fund we need to focus on in terms of delivery. It is far too slow and creating serious frustration. In reality today, we have a greater variety of electric cars and they are more affordable, but there is still range anxiety. Until we can get the network delivered, we will not address that.  More than ever before, we need to consider a network of fast chargers. There are issues over the reliability of the charging stations in rural towns. I have heard anecdotal examples of stations with three out of four chargers not working. I have never pulled up at a petrol or diesel pump that was not working, and I do not believe an EV owner should have to do likewise. We have to provide EV owners with reliability at the same level. I ask the Minister of State to boost the uptake, address the barriers and come up with some sort of framework to deal with reliability. I encourage those behind all the schemes to engage with the communities and explain to them why they take so long. A six-month interval between the submitting of information and the response is simply unacceptable. \n Deputy Seán Canney  I agree with the Deputy that it is not all being done as quickly as we would like. We need to expedite the process to give confidence to people who are considering buying an EV that the infrastructure will be in place and that they will be able to rely on it to get from A to B. Many things have been happening and we are coming to a point where we will see things happening on the ground. We will be working within the Department to push along the projects to ensure they will be delivered in the quickest time possible so people can gain confidence in the EV infrastructure. ",

        "answerText": " Deputy Emer Currie  My question is to ask the Minister for Transport to provide a breakdown of the investment made in enhancing existing bus services in Dublin West from 2020 to date. A handful of routes – four in total – have been introduced under BusConnects, mainly to replace existing services, and one new route called the W4. While we await the full implementation of BusConnects in 2026–27, our existing services are really struggling with demand. \n Deputy Darragh O'Brien  I thank Deputy Currie for her question. Since 2020, over €18.75 million has been invested in bus services alone in Dublin West, reflecting a really strong and ongoing commitment to improving public transport in the area. This includes funding for both new routes and enhancements to existing services. Notably, new routes introduced over the period include the L52, introduced in 2020, the C5 and C6, introduced in 2021, the high-frequency orbital N4, introduced in 2022, the W5, introduced in 2023, and most recently, the N2, introduced in 2024. Enhancements to existing services have been prioritised, with approximately €1.6 million allocated across the period. However, the most substantial enhancements were delivered in 2020, with more than €1.25 million invested that year to improve service levels and reliability.  Looking ahead, while no new enhancements have been introduced yet in 2025, plans are in place to extend route 40D to serve Hollywoodrath later this year. An additional €500,000 is also committed this year to specifically address punctuality and reliability issues on routes 37, 38 and 70. These improvements were rolled out in April and are already supporting more consistent services.  Furthermore, phase 10 of the BusConnects network redesign, the B spine, is scheduled for late 2026 and will deliver significant improvements for Dublin West, subject to operational readiness and funding. In the interim, the NTA is working closely with operators to identify priority routes where capacity constraints are most pressing. Due to a range of factors, including limited driver availability, a prioritised list of enhancements will be developed based on the most urgent needs. I would welcome the Deputy’s input into that. \n Deputy Emer Currie  I thank the Minister. His numbers are the same as the ones I got through a parliamentary question dealing with capacity issues in each of the years 2020 to 2024. Seventeen million euro in that time had been invested in launching new bus routes in Dublin West, but, as the Minister said, just €1.6 million has been spent on enhancing existing bus services.  That discrepancy tells its own story. The €1.6 million that has been spent on enhancement has been patchy. According to the NTA, nothing was spent on enhancements to existing services in Dublin West in 2023. A year before that, in 2022, spending was a grand total of €97. I would love to know what €97 was spent on. There has been some increase since then. In 2024, €407,000 was invested in enhancing existing bus services in Dublin West. That is a fraction of the nearly €2.9 million spent on new routes. It reflects the reality that people are experiencing. It is just not enough when it comes to the growth and demand in established communities, which is most of Dublin West, and the growth of new communities while we wait for BusConnects. \n Deputy Darragh O'Brien  BusConnects is going to make a real difference. It was held up for many reasons. I would suggest that there were initially route design flaws in much of the BusConnects project when it was first published, but that has been rectified. As I said earlier in response to a question, we will see the first BusConnects corridor under construction this year. We have three that are through planning. Rather, 12 are through planning, but a number are being judicially reviewed, which is another story.  The Deputy is right about the €97 that was spent in 2022. I have know idea what that was. As the Minister of State, Deputy Canney, said, it might have been to replace a wing mirror on a bus. Without being facetious about it, further investment is unquestionably needed. I know the Deputy's area very well. It is a major growth area. It is a young area too. The Deputy will have heard a number of other positive developments relating to additional services mentioned already this evening. We have to look at existing services and their reliability. I will bring the Deputy's intervention and feedback this evening directly to the NTA, which reports to me at the end of the day. It selects and approves the routes and route changes, but we need to make sure that it listens to public representatives too. \n Deputy Emer Currie  I would appreciate the Minister's intervention because I find those figures shocking. We cannot wait until BusConnects is implemented in Dublin West, which could be 2027. The Minister mentioned services for Hollywoodrath, including the 37 and 38. I have fought for those enhanced services. Underinvesting in existing services ignores the commuters in established communities who want to shift to public transport. We have seen more than 2,000 new homes built in the Blanchardstown-Mulhuddart local electoral area over the last five years. Many have been in a completely new area called Hollywoodrath. The Minister was there with us. \n Deputy Darragh O'Brien  I was. \n Deputy Emer Currie  There were no new bus services and limited enhancement of the existing ones. Last week, the Green Party had a motion calling on the Government not to put the brakes on progress, but under a Green Party Minister, our community saw a decline in the reliability of its services. I am depending on the Minister to take the opportunity to change that. While BusConnects is promoted as a transformative project, and it will be, we have to properly invest in expanding and improving the services that people currently rely on in the here and now. \n Deputy Darragh O'Brien  Regarding what the Green Party might say in Dublin West, the Green Party held the transport portfolio in the previous Government. Having said that, the Government is responsible for the delivery of all services across the board and we are heavily committed to public transport. That is why I mentioned earlier this evening the debate we had last week. We have seen a record number of public transport users and growth in every area, including Dublin West, but there are areas where there are pressures on commuters. I have said to all our operators, rail, Luas and bus, that the customer has to be first in this. I have said that to the NTA too. We can look at the projects and investment that are needed, but everything has to be focused on the customer. It is customers who are paying for those journeys and it is their tax euros that are being invested in the system. I am happy to arrange a specific meeting between the Deputy and the NTA. I want the Deputy to give that feedback directly to the NTA about the preparation of additional enhancements. BusConnects will change things significantly right across the country, not just in Dublin. We are really focused on getting those projects under way and this Government will do it. ",

        "extracted_answer": "Deputy Emer Currie  My question is to ask the Minister for Transport to provide a breakdown of the investment made in enhancing existing bus services in Dublin West from 2020 to date. A handful of routes – four in total – have been introduced under BusConnects, mainly to replace existing services, and one new route called the W4. While we await the full implementation of BusConnects in 2026–27, our existing services are really struggling with demand. \n Deputy Darragh O'Brien  I thank Deputy Currie for her question. Since 2020, over €18.75 million has been invested in bus services alone in Dublin West, reflecting a really strong and ongoing commitment to improving public transport in the area. This includes funding for both new routes and enhancements to existing services. Notably, new routes introduced over the period include the L52, introduced in 2020, the C5 and C6, introduced in 2021, the high-frequency orbital N4, introduced in 2022, the W5, introduced in 2023, and most recently, the N2, introduced in 2024. Enhancements to existing services have been prioritised, with approximately €1.6 million allocated across the period. However, the most substantial enhancements were delivered in 2020, with more than €1.25 million invested that year to improve service levels and reliability.  Looking ahead, while no new enhancements have been introduced yet in 2025, plans are in place to extend route 40D to serve Hollywoodrath later this year. An additional €500,000 is also committed this year to specifically address punctuality and reliability issues on routes 37, 38 and 70. These improvements were rolled out in April and are already supporting more consistent services.  Furthermore, phase 10 of the BusConnects network redesign, the B spine, is scheduled for late 2026 and will deliver significant improvements for Dublin West, subject to operational readiness and funding. In the interim, the NTA is working closely with operators to identify priority routes where capacity constraints are most pressing. Due to a range of factors, including limited driver availability, a prioritised list of enhancements will be developed based on the most urgent needs. I would welcome the Deputy’s input into that. \n Deputy Emer Currie  I thank the Minister. His numbers are the same as the ones I got through a parliamentary question dealing with capacity issues in each of the years 2020 to 2024. Seventeen million euro in that time had been invested in launching new bus routes in Dublin West, but, as the Minister said, just €1.6 million has been spent on enhancing existing bus services.  That discrepancy tells its own story. The €1.6 million that has been spent on enhancement has been patchy. According to the NTA, nothing was spent on enhancements to existing services in Dublin West in 2023. A year before that, in 2022, spending was a grand total of €97. I would love to know what €97 was spent on. There has been some increase since then. In 2024, €407,000 was invested in enhancing existing bus services in Dublin West. That is a fraction of the nearly €2.9 million spent on new routes. It reflects the reality that people are experiencing. It is just not enough when it comes to the growth and demand in established communities, which is most of Dublin West, and the growth of new communities while we wait for BusConnects. \n Deputy Darragh O'Brien  BusConnects is going to make a real difference. It was held up for many reasons. I would suggest that there were initially route design flaws in much of the BusConnects project when it was first published, but that has been rectified. As I said earlier in response to a question, we will see the first BusConnects corridor under construction this year. We have three that are through planning. Rather, 12 are through planning, but a number are being judicially reviewed, which is another story.  The Deputy is right about the €97 that was spent in 2022. I have know idea what that was. As the Minister of State, Deputy Canney, said, it might have been to replace a wing mirror on a bus. Without being facetious about it, further investment is unquestionably needed. I know the Deputy's area very well. It is a major growth area. It is a young area too. The Deputy will have heard a number of other positive developments relating to additional services mentioned already this evening. We have to look at existing services and their reliability. I will bring the Deputy's intervention and feedback this evening directly to the NTA, which reports to me at the end of the day. It selects and approves the routes and route changes, but we need to make sure that it listens to public representatives too. \n Deputy Emer Currie  I would appreciate the Minister's intervention because I find those figures shocking. We cannot wait until BusConnects is implemented in Dublin West, which could be 2027. The Minister mentioned services for Hollywoodrath, including the 37 and 38. I have fought for those enhanced services. Underinvesting in existing services ignores the commuters in established communities who want to shift to public transport. We have seen more than 2,000 new homes built in the Blanchardstown-Mulhuddart local electoral area over the last five years. Many have been in a completely new area called Hollywoodrath. The Minister was there with us. \n Deputy Darragh O'Brien  I was. \n Deputy Emer Currie  There were no new bus services and limited enhancement of the existing ones. Last week, the Green Party had a motion calling on the Government not to put the brakes on progress, but under a Green Party Minister, our community saw a decline in the reliability of its services. I am depending on the Minister to take the opportunity to change that. While BusConnects is promoted as a transformative project, and it will be, we have to properly invest in expanding and improving the services that people currently rely on in the here and now. \n Deputy Darragh O'Brien  Regarding what the Green Party might say in Dublin West, the Green Party held the transport portfolio in the previous Government. Having said that, the Government is responsible for the delivery of all services across the board and we are heavily committed to public transport. That is why I mentioned earlier this evening the debate we had last week. We have seen a record number of public transport users and growth in every area, including Dublin West, but there are areas where there are pressures on commuters. I have said to all our operators, rail, Luas and bus, that the customer has to be first in this. I have said that to the NTA too.

        "answerText": " Deputy Naoise Ó Cearúil  We have seen the extension of contactless fare payments in cities such as London, Edinburgh, Barcelona and Milan, as well as in the Netherlands. I am looking for the expected timeline for the roll-out of contactless fare payments on all public transport. \n Deputy Darragh O'Brien  I propose to take Questions Nos. 97, 98 and 102 together.  I thank an Teachta Ó Cearúil. For background, the next generation ticketing project, led by the NTA, is for a new, modern public transport ticketing system that will facilitate a variety of payment methods for passengers, including contactless.  In April 2024, the NTA with Government approval entered into a multiyear framework agreement for next generation ticketing with Indra Sistemas S.A. to deliver this project. The initial focus is on the greater Dublin area and it will be rolled out across four phases. This is a major, complex project, with a capital cost of over €160 million - €160 million in Exchequer funds is being invested in this project - to implement it in the greater Dublin area alone, covering the costs of the enabling works to install new equipment for transport operators and the costs for the NTA team delivery team overseeing the project.  Phase 1 of the project in the greater Dublin area is due to launch in summer 2027. I am happy to be able to give that date. We will need to keep a close eye on the progress being made. That will be significant because it will test contactless payment on a small number of new validators or ticket machines. Phase 2 will be ready for summer 2028, allowing passengers on Dublin Bus and Luas services to use the next generation ticketing technology, including contactless payments on validators.  The NTA and Indra are currently planning phase 3, which is implementation across Iarnród Éireann's train services, and phase 4, which is implementation on commuter bus services in and out of Dublin. The NTA will be in a better position to provide timelines once planning is complete.  The timelines are not bad. It is summer 2027 for phase 1. I would like to see that shortening for phases 2, 3 and 4. The fundamental thing is to get the IT system in place. This will be account-based as well. It will be better than the system in Britain, which people might be used to if they use tap-on and tap-off, because they will also be able to have accounts. I am interrogating those timelines.  This would be transformative for our transport system across all bus, rail, Luas and DART services. In the meantime, and as an interim measure, Iarnród Eireann already provides for passengers to download a QR code to their phone, removing the need for a physical ticket on longer journeys. Obviously, we have the Leap card as well, which I use. In addition, the NTA's barcode-based app, TFI Go, already allows customers to buy a range of tickets for bus services outside Dublin, including on all Bus Éireann public service obligation services, Dublin commuter routes operated by Go-Ahead Ireland and all local link rural services nationwide. As part of the young adult fares scheme, 27 private bus operators already sell their tickets on the TFI Go app.  It is good news that this is being advanced. It is a significant investment on behalf of our people, but it is a critical project. I am not at all questioning the complexities involved, but I want to interrogate those timelines further. If we can get phase 1 going by summer 2027, I would be content with that. However, I am not sure I want to wait until summer 2028 for phase 2. I do not yet have timeframes for phases 3 and 4. I will meet with the NTA to discuss this matter shortly. I have already met with the NTA a number of times in respect of it. The Government is committed to this. I want to see it in place; done correctly, obviously, and in a timely fashion. \n Deputy Naoise Ó Cearúil  The Minister has announced extremely positive news here this evening that is extremely welcome. It would be great to see a breakdown of the timelines. What do we need to do in order to get to the first phase in the summer of 2027? Is there a need for procurement of IT systems? Are particular systems for buses, etc., required? It would be great to see the routes included in phase 1 as well. Would it be possible to expedite those later phases? We have to wait until the summer of 2028 for phase 2. Phase 3 relates to Iarnród Éireann and phase 4 relates to commuter buses. Obviously, the vast majority of people who commute to Dublin, particularly from Kildare North, do so by bus or rail. If we could get a breakdown to ensure we meet those timelines and to see if they could be expedited it would be very beneficial. \n Deputy Joe Neville  Can we get a contactless payment system in the interim? Obviously, the timelines have been highlighted. It might be another two, three or four years before things happen. Could we look at putting in place an interim measure that whereby people could use app to make contactless payments? Coming from north Kildare, it does not seem reasonable that we should expect it to take three or four years. \n Deputy Darragh O'Brien  Deputy Neville may have missed the final part of my answer. TFI has the TFI Go app in place, and we have Leap cards as an interim measure as well. The point is taken, however. Many of the resources will be used in implementing this new system. Obviously, some will be used to design it but most will be used to implement it. I have a more detailed breakdown of the major release phases. Phase 1, which, as I mentioned, is scheduled for summer 2027, will introduce a small number of new ticketing machines for a combination of bus, tram and train services. That is to test and improve the functionality of the validators. It is right and proper that this is done before committing to a larger scale development.  We then get to the major release 2, assuming the test phase of the major release 1 works well. This involves installing new validators, initially across the Dublin city bus and Luas networks. This will take some time to complete, which is fair enough, and will involve replacing all of the validators on 1,300-plus buses and approximately 400 validators across 69 stops in the tram network. I understand there is a complexity involved , particularly when you are keeping Leap cards, free travel and all of the existing measures in place, such as the TFI Go app and others I mentioned. You are introducing a new system while you are operating the existing one.  Effectively, you then move into major release 3, which brings in Iarnród Éireann, or Irish Rail. That is a separate release owing to the specific complexity of installing and removing station gates. This will involve quite a lot of physical work on our rail network. In major release 4, the NTA will extend contactless bank card payments and barcode tickets to commuter and other bus services in the Dublin commuter zone. There are four phases, as I have stated, and four different releases. I will be meeting the NTA on this to see if there is any way we can shrink the timelines. However, it is welcome that it will start in summer 2027. \n Deputy Naoise Ó Cearúil  As I said, this is extremely positive news. It is great to see such a development. Indra Sistemas, which is carrying out the work, has done similar work previously in an international context. Are there any binding milestones built into the contract? The reason I ask is because there are four phases, which is excellent, and we can see clear steps to achieve the overarching aim, but the priority should be to ensure that everything is delivered on time and within budget. Could we get an understanding of the contractual arrangements with Indra Sistemas?  It goes without saying that there are more vulnerable users, older people in particular, who would like to continue to use cash. It is important to ensure that option is still available for those people and for those who prefer to use cash.  I thank the Minister for his work on this. It has been a priority for him, and it is great to see progress here so far. \n Deputy Joe Neville  The reason I bring up contactless payments is because I commute from north Kildare. As someone who has used buses and trains over years, I have seen the improvements in the public transport system. At the same time, contactless payments are something we have seen in many other countries and cities. A lot of people would have used them in different places. I see no reason Dublin and Ireland should be any different. That is the reason I tabled my question, but I also wanted to speak to an interim measure we could use. We all use our Leap cards, we all update them on the app and we all update our payments, but, sooner rather than later, it should be a simple case of being able to tap and go. Obviously, it will be a costly and complex exercise but we will need simple steps in place in order that we can identify the costs along the way, how they are orientated and whether the projects are hitting their targets within the timeline. I am very happy that contactless payments are a key focus for the Minister. Hopefully, we look to them being delivered in the near future. The sooner we get an interim measure in place, the better it will be for everyone. \n Deputy Darragh O'Brien  I thank both Deputies for their support. I will meet the NTA and Indra Sistemas, which is developing this system. I will try to secure more specific timelines from the company. It has been very helpful so far. Work is progressing very well. On the contractual arrangements, I do not have that detail right now. I commit to reverting to both Deputies with an update on this after I meet with the NTA and Indra Sistemas.  If we look at other innovations that have taken place, the Leap card was a big step forward from what we had before. The 90-minute fare is very useful. The interaction of the Leap card between all of our transport operators as well is useful. It is not too many years ago that this option was not available to people. Thankfully, because this Government is still committed to free travel for our seniors, there will be no requirement for cash payments for most of them. As the Deputies know, a commitment made by the previous Government and this one is that people with free travel will be able to bring a companion with them, and it is being rolled out right now. Later this year, probably in September, we will bring forward free travel for those between the ages of five and eight. The purpose of this is to recognise that costs are high too for families. We also want kids who are using buses, etc., to get used to doing so in order that it becomes a habit. We had record public transport passenger journeys last year. We want to try to exceed that this year. People are responding in that regard right across urban and rural locations. The Minister of State, Deputy Buttimer, answered questions about the advancement of Local Link. That has been really significant.  We have a great deal of work to do in this space, but real progress has been made. I will keep Deputies Neville and Ó Cearúil up to date. I will revert to them, post my meeting with the NTA, with specific timelines. ",

I am very happy that contactless payments are a key focus for the Minister. Hopefully, we look to them being delivered in the near future. The sooner we get an interim measure in place, the better it will be for everyone. \n Deputy Darragh O'Brien  I thank both Deputies for their support. I will meet the NTA and Indra Sistemas, which is developing this system. I will try to secure more specific timelines from the company. It has been very helpful so far. Work is progressing very well. On the contractual arrangements, I do not have that detail right now. I commit to reverting to both Deputies with an update on this after I meet with the NTA and Indra Sistemas.  If we look at other innovations that have taken place, the Leap card was a big step forward from what we had before. The 90-minute fare is very useful. The interaction of the Leap card between all of our transport operators as well is useful. It is not too many years ago that this option was not available to people. Thankfully, because this Government is still committed to free travel for our seniors, there will be no requirement for cash payments for most of them. As the Deputies know, a commitment made by the previous Government and this one is that people with free travel will be able to bring a companion with them, and it is being rolled out right now. Later this year, probably in September, we will bring forward free travel for those between the ages of five and eight. The purpose of this is to recognise that costs are high too for families. We also want kids who are using buses, etc., to get used to doing so in order that it becomes a habit. We had record public transport passenger journeys last year. We want to try to exceed that this year. People are responding in that regard right across urban and rural locations. The Minister of State, Deputy Buttimer, answered questions about the advancement of Local Link. That has been really significant.  We have a great deal of work to do in this space, but real progress has been made. I will keep Deputies Neville and Ó Cearúil up to date. I will revert to them, post my meeting with the NTA, with specific timelines.",

        "formatted_answer": "The Next Generation Ticketing project, led by the National Transport Authority (NTA), involves a contract with Indra Sistemas S.A. that began in April 2024. The project is divided into four phases:\n\n1. **Phase 1 (Summer 2027):** Introduction of new ticketing machines in the greater Dublin area for testing.\n2. **Phase 2 (Summer 2028):** Installation of validators on Dublin Bus and Luas services.\n3. **Phase 3 (2029):** Implementation on Iarnród Éireann (Irish Rail) train services.\n4. **Phase 4 (2030):** Extension to commuter bus services.\n\nThe project includes a capital investment of over €160 million. Interim solutions like the TFI Go app and Leap cards are currently available for contactless payments."

        "answerText": " Deputy Aindrias Moynihan  There is a need to upgrade the surface of the N22 between Macroom and Ballincollig. TII did not approve funding to the council for the upgrade earlier this year. What options are now available to the council to improve this surface and make the road safer? \n Deputy Darragh O'Brien  I thank Deputy Moynihan. The Government earmarked about €2.9 billion for the protection and renewal of the national road network as part of the National Development Plan 2021 to 2030. As the Deputy knows, the NDP is under review. That includes funding to renew pavement on the new network. In addition, €5.1 billion was earmarked for investment in new national roads projects. While the greater portion of the funding becomes available in the second half of the decade, I can confirm that approximately €600 million of Exchequer capital funds was provided to local authorities through TII for national roads in 2025. Of this, €74 million was allocated to Cork city and county councils.  As part of the current NDP, the N22 road between Cork and Kerry has seen significant development in recent years, not least with the completion of the Baile Bhuirne to Macroom project. In conjunction with the N22 Farranfore to Killarney project, which is being developed, this will deliver greatly improved connectivity between Cork and Kerry. In regard to the section between Macroom and Ballincollig, while it has not been possible so far to allocate funding for pavement works this year, funding has been provided for road safety schemes at Castlemore and Kilcondy. In addition, funding has been provided for a fixed safety camera pilot on the route.  With regard to future investment, the programme for Government commits to increasing funding for protection and renewal. This should allow the pace of road pavement renewal to be stepped up, including the section east of Macroom to Ballincollig. What I am basically saying is that I am aware of the really poor state of this section of road. The Deputy has mentioned it and the Minister of State, Deputy Buttimer, mentioned it to me again this evening.  I am glad Deputy Moynihan asked this question. We need to be more active with our agencies in making sure, as I said to a previous Deputy, that the feedback from public representatives on behalf of their constituents is actually listened to. This section of road needs to be attended to. We will have an increased roads programme for next year and we will try to secure additional funding to make sure this section of road is attended to. \n Deputy Aindrias Moynihan  Some 32,000 vehicles travel on this section of road every day. There is a big flow of traffic coming from west Cork. It is a key artery into the city for many people. Road surface is a major aspect of road safety. Traffic travelling at 100 km/h hitting large holes is just dangerous. Drivers trying to avoid these holes by swerving around them present a danger too. Did the council make a specific application for funding for this work this year? Across the country, projects come under pressure during the year. There may well also be other projects that are not able to proceed to construction. Is there an opportunity to reallocate funding towards a priority project like the N22? \n Deputy Darragh O'Brien  I know the volume of traffic on the N22 is high and increasing. The paving is poor. The Deputy mentioned potholes. Following his intervention through this parliamentary question, I will make direct contact to see what remedial works can be done in the interim. I cannot say if funding will be reallocated later this year. We have just recently allocated the 2025 funding but I will ask. Good work is being done on other parts of the N22 but I want to make sure this section is not forgotten about. I will contact TII in this regard, particularly to see what can be done with the local authority in the interim this year. The fixed camera is working to reduce speed in that area. I do not know if a specific submission was received from the local authority, but I will find out for him and take this matter up with TII. I will keep him informed of the feedback from that meeting. \n Deputy Aindrias Moynihan  The Minister's intervention is hugely appreciated. This is a vital section of road. The Minister mentioned safety works being approved in Castlemore and Kilcondy. Those junctions are vital, as are so many others along the road, but at those junctions in particular, we have, unfortunately, seen many major accidents and tragic loss of life. The council is moving ahead with those works. This year's allocation will not be enough to build any of it but it will move the project towards construction.  Can those much-needed safety works be prioritised for funding to make that road safer in any future allocation? \n Deputy Darragh O'Brien  The Deputy may take from the fact that we have done a lot of the preparatory work on design and preparation for the schemes in Castlemore and Kilcondy that we want to see them proceed to the next stage. That will be the logical step going forward into 2026. We will make sure that happens. The Ministers of State, Deputies Canney and Buttimer, and I have increased our roads funding this year by about €92 million. We received that draft funding package quite late because the Government had only come in, yet we were able to effect an increase. We will have a more significant increase in our roads programme next year. Government colleagues' interventions, including the Deputy's, regarding what is important in their own areas will be taken in the round because they are the people elected by their constituents. I will reference the particular section east of Macroom to Ballincollig with TII and I will revert to the Deputy. ",

However, I am not involved in day-to-day operations. The statutory responsibility for delivering and managing public transport services, including the publication and maintenance of network maps, rests with the National Transport Authority (NTA).  I have been informed by the NTA that they have developed a wide range of network maps that cover the public transport network, which they have published on the Transport for Ireland/TFI website.  These maps include a TFI Regional Public Transport map that displays regional bus routes, rail lines, train stations, airports, ferry ports and also included points of interest across Ireland. They have developed six city network maps covering Dublin, Cork Galway, Limerick, Waterford and Kilkenny, including the different bus and train routes for each city.  There are also maps summarising town bus services available in Cavan, Navan and Drogheda as well as Portlaoise Clonmel and Sligo areas.  I have also been advised that members of the public can obtain digital maps for individual journeys on the TFI website. These can be accessed on the journey planner section of the website by inputting the preferred route number.  The NTA have confirmed to my Department that they are currently working on an updated version of their network maps with regard public transport and hope to be in a position to publish them in the coming months.  The use of these public transport network maps forms a key part of transport planning, and work in line with the Programme for Government commitment for the improvement of transport networks countrywide, to promote increased business investment in the economy and the supply of new housing.

        "extracted_answer": "Minister for Transport  As Minister for Transport, my role involves setting public transport policy and overseeing overall funding. However, I am not involved in day-to-day operations. The statutory responsibility for delivering and managing public transport services, including the publication and maintenance of network maps, rests with the National Transport Authority (NTA).  I have been informed by the NTA that they have developed a wide range of network maps that cover the public transport network, which they have published on the Transport for Ireland/TFI website.  These maps include a TFI Regional Public Transport map that displays regional bus routes, rail lines, train stations, airports, ferry ports and also included points of interest across Ireland. They have developed six city network maps covering Dublin, Cork Galway, Limerick, Waterford and Kilkenny, including the different bus and train routes for each city.  There are also maps summarising town bus services available in Cavan, Navan and Drogheda as well as Portlaoise Clonmel and Sligo areas.  I have also been advised that members of the public can obtain digital maps for individual journeys on the TFI website. These can be accessed on the journey planner section of the website by inputting the preferred route number.  The NTA have confirmed to my Department that they are currently working on an updated version of their network maps with regard public transport and hope to be in a position to publish them in the coming months.  The use of these public transport network maps forms a key part of transport planning, and work in line with the Programme for Government commitment for the improvement of transport networks countrywide, to promote increased business investment in the economy and the supply of new housing.",

The National Ports Policy has been successful in achieving many of its broad objectives including the categorisation of State-owned commercial companies into two tiers of national significance and ports of regional significance, the successful fostering of competition between commercial state ports and facilitating low barriers to market entry for shipping companies.  There have been many significant changes in the global ports and shipping environment in recent years. These changes necessitate new thinking to respond to emerging environmental, technological, demographic, and geopolitical challenges.  The first phase of the review of the National Ports Policy commenced with the publication of an 'Issues Paper' for public consultation on 19 October 2023. The Issues Paper identified twelve broad themes, including the future of port capacity, that require revised and updated policy responses to create a robust and purposeful framework for the years ahead.  I am pleased to note that over 70 responses to the consultation were received. The Department has assessed those responses to the Issues Paper and my officials are finalising a draft of the revised policy.  The revised policy will also be subject to the completion of a Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) and related environmental screening.  I will engage with my officials in the coming weeks following the completion of an initial environmental assessment of the draft revised policy and will discuss the emerging policy recommendations with my colleague, Minister Darragh O'Brien T.D..

        "answerText": " Minister of State at the Department of Transport  The National Driver Testing Service is operated by the Road Safety Authority as part of its statutory duties. It is not a service provided for by way of contract and driver testers and other staff of the Authority who run the service are directly employed by the State. The agreed Service Level Agreement with the Department of Transport is for a 10 week average wait time.  The National Driver Testing Service has been under significant pressure to meet unprecedented demand with the growth in people seeking tests accelerating. This has put significant pressure on wait times with current wait times far above what should reasonably be expected. The return to the 10 week period is a priority for me and my Department.  In that regard and at my direction, the RSA on 22 May published a comprehensive action plan to return the target average driver testing wait time to 10 weeks by early September. This plan sets out the actions that will be taken by the RSA to achieve this goal. As of 14 June, the RSA is reporting that the average national waiting time for a driving test stood at approximately 18 weeks. This builds on the progress to end of May which saw wait times of approximately 21 weeks and is an improvement of almost 9 weeks on the wait time at the end of April of 27 weeks.  This progress has been achieved through a number of positive actions taken by the RSA including around accelerated driver tester training, extended testing hours including at evening time, weekends/ Bank Holidays and positive interventions in relation to the operation of the booking system to ensure slots are available in places with the highest demand and wait time.. It is also positive that two new centres will soon be opening in Drogheda and Sandyford which should assist in reducing average wait times.  It is vital that this positive trend continues and that the RSA, at a minimum, meets the targets set out in its published plan.  The long-term fix to this issue will be the recruitment and onboarding of new driver testers in the months ahead and will ensure that the RSA can continue to deliver a greater number of tests year on year. It is positive that 30 additional testers are expected to be deployed into the service across the month of July. As additional testers enter the system, testing capacity will increase and progress should continue to be seen on reducing waiting times in the months ahead.  To support the RSA in increasing testing capacity and improving service delivery, in September 2024 the Department of Transport sanctioned an additional 70 permanent positions for driver testers. This increases the total permanent sanction for testers to 200. The recruitment and training processes are underway and the RSA expect to have 200 testers in the system by September this year. This will represent a doubling of permanent posts since June 2022.  Should any deviations from projected timelines arise these must be immediately addressed with the Department of Transport. The RSA has also been instructed to make contingency preparations to deal with any potential slippages that might emerge in relation to this timeline, which should be ready to be activated as quickly as possible should the need arise.  Finally, I must note that the National Car Testing service operates on a different model to driver testing. The NCT is statutorily a responsibility of the RSA also but is contracted out to a private sector service provider.

[34069/25]",
        "extracted_answer": "Minister of State at the Department of Transport  The National Driver Testing Service is operated by the Road Safety Authority as part of its statutory duties. It is not a service provided for by way of contract and driver testers and other staff of the Authority who run the service are directly employed by the State. The agreed Service Level Agreement with the Department of Transport is for a 10 week average wait time.  The National Driver Testing Service has been under significant pressure to meet unprecedented demand with the growth in people seeking tests accelerating. This has put significant pressure on wait times with current wait times far above what should reasonably be expected. The return to the 10 week period is a priority for me and my Department.  In that regard and at my direction, the RSA on 22 May published a comprehensive action plan to return the target average driver testing wait time to 10 weeks by early September. This plan sets out the actions that will be taken by the RSA to achieve this goal. As of 14 June, the RSA is reporting that the average national waiting time for a driving test stood at approximately 18 weeks. This builds on the progress to end of May which saw wait times of approximately 21 weeks and is an improvement of almost 9 weeks on the wait time at the end of April of 27 weeks.  This progress has been achieved through a number of positive actions taken by the RSA including around accelerated driver tester training, extended testing hours including at evening time, weekends/ Bank Holidays and positive interventions in relation to the operation of the booking system to ensure slots are available in places with the highest demand and wait time.. It is also positive that two new centres will soon be opening in Drogheda and Sandyford which should assist in reducing average wait times.  It is vital that this positive trend continues and that the RSA, at a minimum, meets the targets set out in its published plan.  The long-term fix to this issue will be the recruitment and onboarding of new driver testers in the months ahead and will ensure that the RSA can continue to deliver a greater number of tests year on year. It is positive that 30 additional testers are expected to be deployed into the service across the month of July. As additional testers enter the system, testing capacity will increase and progress should continue to be seen on reducing waiting times in the months ahead.  To support the RSA in increasing testing capacity and improving service delivery, in September 2024 the Department of Transport sanctioned an additional 70 permanent positions for driver testers. This increases the total permanent sanction for testers to 200. The recruitment and training processes are underway and the RSA expect to have 200 testers in the system by September this year. This will represent a doubling of permanent posts since June 2022.  Should any deviations from projected timelines arise these must be immediately addressed with the Department of Transport. The RSA has also been instructed to make contingency preparations to deal with any potential slippages that might emerge in relation to this timeline, which should be ready to be activated as quickly as possible should the need arise.  Finally, I must note that the National Car Testing service operates on a different model to driver testing. The NCT is statutorily a responsibility of the RSA also but is contracted out to a private sector service provider. While the RSA's contract with the provider provides for performance targets, neither these nor those for the driver testing service are set out in statute.",
        "formatted_question": "Has the possibility of establishing a statutory ten-week waiting period for the RSA to conduct driving tests been analyzed?",
        "formatted_answer": "1. The National Driver Testing Service, operated by the RSA, is a statutory duty and not contracted out.\n2. The Service Level Agreement with the Department of Transport targets a 10-week average wait time.\n3. The RSA has faced increased demand, leading to longer wait times exceeding the target.\n4. As of 14 June, the average wait time was 18 weeks, down from 21 weeks in May and 27 weeks in April.\n5. An action plan was published on 22 May aiming to reduce wait times to 10 weeks by early September.\n6. Measures include accelerated training, extended testing hours, and system adjustments.\n7. Two new testing centers are set to open in Drogheda and Sandyford.\n8. 30 additional testers are expected in July, with 70 more permanent positions approved, reaching 200 testers by September.\n9. Unlike the NCT, which is contracted out, the driver testing service is directly managed by the RSA."

        "answerText": " Minister of State at the Department of Transport  As Minister of State for International & Road Transport, Logistics, Rail & Ports, I am committed to supporting the decarbonisation of road freight and commercial coaches.  While my Department’s policy, as detailed in Ireland’s Road Haulage Strategy 2022-2031 is for the Heavy Duty Vehicles (HDV) fleet to transition to zero emission technologies, interim solutions, such as biomethane/CNG and HVO, are being supported in the medium term. Government is committed to increasing the use of renewable fuels as a means to support emission reductions for diesel vehicles, which will remain a large majority in the national fleet until zero emission trucks become cost competitive with diesel engines. The CAP24 sets non-binding targets, to be achieved via the Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation on fuel suppliers, to reach at least a 20% sectoral share consumption of biodiesel (B20) by 2030 and a 10% bioethanol sectoral share consumption (E10) by 2030.  Further, biofuels are fully relieved from the carbon component of Mineral Oil Tax. This means that no carbon tax applies to biofuels, such as HVO or biomethane, used in any road vehicle, private or commercial. As annual increases in the carbon tax are implemented, the differential in tax costs between biofuels and fossil fuels will continue to widen, further incentivising the uptake of biofuels.  My Department is currently preparing a revised National Policy Framework on Alternative Fuels Infrastructure, as required under the EU’s Alternative Fuels Infrastructure Regulation (AFIR). AFIR mandates targets for EV recharging and hydrogen refuelling infrastructure for HDVs and my Department is working to identify and develop pathways to deliver the required infrastructure to support the transition to zero emission vehicles in the freight and coach sector  Funding and schemes are available for the sector to support the transition to Zero Emission operations. The Zero Emission Heavy-Duty Vehicle (‘ZEHDV’) Purchase Grant Scheme supports and promotes the decarbonisation of the heavy-duty sector to transition to Zero Emission vehicles. The Scheme supports the purchase of new large commercial vehicles by bridging some of the price difference between conventional heavy-duty vehicles and Zero Emission vehicles, which offer environmental benefits. The scheme has a budget of €3.5m in 2025. In November 2024, the scheme expanded to include grants for recharging infrastructure at depots, logistics hubs and urban nodes from early 2025. A new Fleet Assessment Audit, which launched in Q2 2025, will also be administered by SEAI, offering businesses an assessment by an independent energy advisor, who would provide guidance on the transition to zero emission vehicles.  In addition, the Accelerated Capital Allowance (‘ACA Scheme’) for Gas Vehicles and Refuelling Equipment and the Triple EEE ACA scheme are tax incentive schemes that promotes investment in Low emission HDVs. The ACA is based on the long-standing 'Wear and Tear Allowance' for investment in capital plant and machinery, whereby capital depreciation can be compensated through a reduction in an organisation's tax liability. This scheme allows operators to reduce their immediate tax bill against company profits when investing in zero emission vehicles through the Triple EEE for electric trucks and Hydrogen/Biomethane through the Gas Vehicle scheme.  My Department is actively collaborating with stakeholders in the hydrogen sector to develop an evidence base for the transition of HDVs to hydrogen fuelled vehicles. In relation to hydrogen infrastructure, my Department, in collaboration with the Department of the Taoiseach and the Department for the Economy in Northern Ireland, has completed two phases of a Shared Island Initiative to examine the safety and feasibility of hydrogen for the transport sector. Last month, my Department, in collaboration with the Department for Infrastructure in Northern Ireland, published a request for tender for Phase III of the project to develop a procurement strategy and preliminary business case to deliver two publicly accessible hydrogen refuelling stations along the Dublin – Belfast corridor, one in Ireland and one in Northern Ireland.  In relation to HVO, the availability of renewable transport fuels including HVO will remain constrained given current global production capacity, the need for sustainable feedstock and increasing demand from various sectors to use renewable fuels in their decarbonisation journey. The Department is finalising a detailed study on HVO use in the HGV sector to estimate how much HVO is currently used, likely future availability and price, decarbonisation potential and the feasibility of transitional incentives which would not delay the overall trajectory for transition to zero emission HGV fleets. The report is currently being reviewed by Department officials and I look forward to sharing the results of the study in the near future. ",

        "answerText": " Minister for Transport  As the Deputy may be aware, the Cork Metropolitan Area Transport Strategy (CMATS) was developed by the National Transport Authority (NTA) in collaboration with Transport Infrastructure Ireland (TII), Cork City Council and Cork County Council. The strategy sets out a framework for the planning and delivery of transport infrastructure and services in the Cork Metropolitan Area up to 2040. A key principle for CMATS is to reduce dependency on the private car within the Cork commuter area, while increasing the appeal of sustainable transport options, such as Cork Area Commuter Rail, BusConnects Cork, active travel, and light rail.  With regard specifically to BusConnects Cork, the NTA submitted the Preliminary Business Case for the programme to my Department in January 2025. Officials in my Department are currently reviewing this business case. In line with the Infrastructure Guidelines, the Preliminary Business Case is also going through an external assurance process and will be reviewed by the Public Expenditure, Public Service Reform and Digitalisation’s Major Projects Advisory Group before being submitted to Cabinet for consideration. If approved by Cabinet at Approval Gate 1 of the Infrastructure Guidelines, this will allow the programme to enter the planning process.  Noting the NTA's responsibility in developing and implementing CMATS, I have referred the Deputy's question to the NTA for an update on other projects and programmes being progressed as part of CMATS. Please contact my private office if you do not receive a reply within 10 days. ",
