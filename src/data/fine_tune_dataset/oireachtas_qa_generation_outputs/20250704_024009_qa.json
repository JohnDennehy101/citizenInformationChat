Both studies will form part of the analysis used to inform the development of the multi-modal GMATS, alongside recommendations for active travel, bus, rail, roads and demand management measures. The Light Rail Feasibility Study was published by the NTA on 30 October 2024 for information.The feasibility study is not intended to specifically identify a preferred alignment of a light rail corridor in the city; instead it explores key issues and potential feasibility. The study has shown that there could, under the right conditions be a case for developing a light rail system in Galway. Any future light rail project will depend on funding and government approval.  In relation to the Strategic Roads Feasibility Study, in January 2023, the High Court remitted the application for approval of the N6 Galway City Ring Road (GCRR) back to An Bord Pleanála (now An Coimisiún Pleanála) for further consideration. On 15th April 2025, Galway County Council provided additional updated information in relation to the planning consent application for the Ring Road, and the application is now with An Coimisiún Pleanála for its review and consideration.

Under the Roads Acts 1993-2015, the operation and management of individual national roads is a matter for Transport Infrastructure Ireland (TII), in conjunction with the local authorities concerned. Therefore, matters relating to the day to day operations regarding national roads, including toll roads and the establishment of a system of tolls, are within the remit of TII. More specifically, the statutory power to levy tolls, to make toll bye-laws and to enter into agreements with private investors are vested in TII under Part V of the Roads Act 1993 (as amended).  There are currently eleven toll roads in the State, of which ten are on the national road network. Of the ten tolls on the national road network, two are essentially “public” tolls, namely the M50 and the Dublin Tunnel. Revenue from these tolls is collected directly for TII by operating companies under contract to TII.  The other eight roads are “Public Private Partnership” (PPP) roads which were constructed and are now operated and maintained under long term contracts with TII. Revenue generated by these roads is collected by the PPP company and is used to repay loans borrowed to fund the construction of the road and the ongoing operations, maintenance and life-cycle renewals.  With regard to the N/M20 project, the project team provided an update to members of the public earlier this month. The project team, in considering various options in relation to the delivery of this project, is currently recommending that the scheme should be tolled. However, no final decision has been taken in this regard. The introduction of tolling would be subject to compliance with the requirements of the Infrastructure Guidelines and further statutory approvals. ",

        "extracted_answer": "Minister for Transport  As Minister for Transport I have responsibility for overall policy and funding in relation to the national roads programme. Under the Roads Acts 1993-2015, the operation and management of individual national roads is a matter for Transport Infrastructure Ireland (TII), in conjunction with the local authorities concerned. Therefore, matters relating to the day to day operations regarding national roads, including toll roads and the establishment of a system of tolls, are within the remit of TII. More specifically, the statutory power to levy tolls, to make toll bye-laws and to enter into agreements with private investors are vested in TII under Part V of the Roads Act 1993 (as amended).  There are currently eleven toll roads in the State, of which ten are on the national road network. Of the ten tolls on the national road network, two are essentially “public” tolls, namely the M50 and the Dublin Tunnel.

        "formatted_answer": "The Minister for Transport oversees national roads policy and funding. Transport Infrastructure Ireland (TII) manages national roads, including tolling. There are 11 toll roads, with 10 on the national network. Two are public tolls (M50 and Dublin Tunnel), while the other eight are PPP roads. Revenue from public tolls goes to TII, and PPP tolls fund road maintenance and repay loans. The N/M20 project is considering tolling, but no decision has been made; it will follow Infrastructure Guidelines and require statutory approvals."

        "answerText": " Minister for Transport  In accordance with the provisions of Section 13 of the Roads Act 1993, each local authority has statutory responsibility for the improvement and maintenance of their regional and local roads. Works on those roads are funded from local authorities' own resources and are supplemented by State Road grants. Of these grants, the vast majority (approximately 90%) are targeted at the maintenance and renewal of the network with c. 10% of the remaining funding invested in new roads/bridges or for road realignments.Any new road projects that seek State funding are assessed by the Department on a case-by-case basis. All projects proposed by local authorities for consideration must comply with the requirements of the Infrastructure Guidelines (formerly the Public Spending Code) and the Department's Transport Appraisal Framework. Given the limited funding available for regional and local road improvement works it is important for local authorities to prioritise projects within their overall area of responsibility with these requirements in mind.In this regard, Cork County Council submitted an initial project appraisal to the Department in 2019 regarding the upgrade of the R624 Cobh Road. The project, as submitted, includes upgrading the existing N25-R624 interchange, the provision of a dual carriageway from the interchange to Marino Point, widening of Slatty Bridge, the provision of a new bridge crossing to Great Island at Belvelly and upgrading the existing R624 from Marino Point to Cobh. The estimated cost of this scheme was more than €100 million, with possible staged implementation.In line with Government requirements Cork County Council also produced a Strategic Assessment Report (SAR) for the Great Island Connectivity Scheme and a draft was forwarded to the Department in November 2022. Since then, both the Public Spending Code and the Department’s Transport Appraisal Framework (TAF) guidance have been updated - the Department liaised with the Council regarding new requirements under the new infrastructure Guidelines and the TAF including the preparation of a Project Outline Document (POD) and business case incorporating the work already undertaken at the SAR stage.The Council submitted the POD to the Department in March 2024. Following the submission of the POD, the Council commenced work on developing a brief for the appointment of consultants to deliver the scheme through options assessment, design and planning, starting with the commencement of a Preliminary Business Case. The Council submitted the brief for appointment of consultants in December 2024 to the Department for review. The Council hopes to appoint a consultant in mid-2025 once the brief has been finalised.An allocation of €350,000 was made to Cork County Council as part of the 2025 Regional and Local Roads Grants to assist in the development of the Preliminary Business Case.

Works on those roads are funded from local authorities' own resources and are supplemented by State Road grants. Of these grants, the vast majority (approximately 90%) are targeted at the maintenance and renewal of the network with c. 10% of the remaining funding invested in new roads/bridges or for road realignments.Any new road projects that seek State funding are assessed by the Department on a case-by-case basis. All projects proposed by local authorities for consideration must comply with the requirements of the Infrastructure Guidelines (formerly the Public Spending Code) and the Department's Transport Appraisal Framework. Given the limited funding available for regional and local road improvement works it is important for local authorities to prioritise projects within their overall area of responsibility with these requirements in mind.In this regard, Cork County Council submitted an initial project appraisal to the Department in 2019 regarding the upgrade of the R624 Cobh Road. The project, as submitted, includes upgrading the existing N25-R624 interchange, the provision of a dual carriageway from the interchange to Marino Point, widening of Slatty Bridge, the provision of a new bridge crossing to Great Island at Belvelly and upgrading the existing R624 from Marino Point to Cobh. The estimated cost of this scheme was more than €100 million, with possible staged implementation.In line with Government requirements Cork County Council also produced a Strategic Assessment Report (SAR) for the Great Island Connectivity Scheme and a draft was forwarded to the Department in November 2022. Since then, both the Public Spending Code and the Department’s Transport Appraisal Framework (TAF) guidance have been updated - the Department liaised with the Council regarding new requirements under the new infrastructure Guidelines and the TAF including the preparation of a Project Outline Document (POD) and business case incorporating the work already undertaken at the SAR stage.The Council submitted the POD to the Department in March 2024. Following the submission of the POD, the Council commenced work on developing a brief for the appointment of consultants to deliver the scheme through options assessment, design and planning, starting with the commencement of a Preliminary Business Case. The Council submitted the brief for appointment of consultants in December 2024 to the Department for review. The Council hopes to appoint a consultant in mid-2025 once the brief has been finalised.An allocation of €350,000 was made to Cork County Council as part of the 2025 Regional and Local Roads Grants to assist in the development of the Preliminary Business Case.",

The National Transport Authority (NTA), in conjunction with Galway City Council and Galway County Council, is developing the Galway Metropolitan Area Transport Strategy (GMATS). This strategy will replace the existing Galway Transport Strategy adopted in 2016 and will provide a long-term strategic planning framework for the delivery of transport and the integrated development of transport infrastructure and services in the Galway Metropolitan Area.As part of the development of the new GMATS, mode specific analysis is being undertaken in the form of a Light Rail Feasibility Study and a Strategic Roads Feasibility Study. Both studies will form part of the analysis used to inform the development of the multi-modal GMATS, alongside recommendations for active travel, bus, rail, roads and demand management measures. The Light Rail Feasibility Study was published by the NTA on 30 October 2024 for information.The feasibility study is not intended to specifically identify a preferred alignment of a light rail corridor in the city; instead it explores key issues and potential feasibility. The study has shown that there could, under the right conditions be a case for developing a light rail system in Galway. Any future light rail project will depend on funding and government approval.  In relation to the Strategic Roads Feasibility Study, in January 2023, the High Court remitted the application for approval of the N6 Galway City Ring Road (GCRR) back to An Bord Pleanála (now An Coimisiún Pleanála) for further consideration. On 15th April 2025, Galway County Council provided additional updated information in relation to the planning consent application for the Ring Road, and the application is now with An Coimisiún Pleanála for its review and consideration.  The NTA considers that it is appropriate to await An Coimisiún Pleanála’s determination on the re-submitted N6 Galway City Ring Road application. The NTA will then review the timeline, and publication date for the GMATS when this determination has been made.  In the meantime, implementation will continue on the current Galway Transport Strategy. A significant amount of planning and design has already taken place which will enable construction activity in the coming years across active travel, bus and rail related projects including BusConnects.

Deputy Catherine Connolly asked the Minister for Transport further to Parliamentary Question No. 77 of 8 May 2025, the progress made on the roll-out of light rail for Galway following the publication of the feasibility study on 30 October 2024; and if he will make a statement on the matter. [33846/25]",
        "extracted_answer": "Minister for Transport  I propose to take Questions Nos. 118 and 137 together.  The National Transport Authority (NTA), in conjunction with Galway City Council and Galway County Council, is developing the Galway Metropolitan Area Transport Strategy (GMATS). This strategy will replace the existing Galway Transport Strategy adopted in 2016 and will provide a long-term strategic planning framework for the delivery of transport and the integrated development of transport infrastructure and services in the Galway Metropolitan Area.As part of the development of the new GMATS, mode specific analysis is being undertaken in the form of a Light Rail Feasibility Study and a Strategic Roads Feasibility Study. Both studies will form part of the analysis used to inform the development of the multi-modal GMATS, alongside recommendations for active travel, bus, rail, roads and demand management measures. The Light Rail Feasibility Study was published by the NTA on 30 October 2024 for information.The feasibility study is not intended to specifically identify a preferred alignment of a light rail corridor in the city; instead it explores key issues and potential feasibility. The study has shown that there could, under the right conditions be a case for developing a light rail system in Galway. Any future light rail project will depend on funding and government approval.  In relation to the Strategic Roads Feasibility Study, in January 2023, the High Court remitted the application for approval of the N6 Galway City Ring Road (GCRR) back to An Bord Pleanála (now An Coimisiún Pleanála) for further consideration. On 15th April 2025, Galway County Council provided additional updated information in relation to the planning consent application for the Ring Road, and the application is now with An Coimisiún Pleanála for its review and consideration.  The NTA considers that it is appropriate to await An Coimisiún Pleanála’s determination on the re-submitted N6 Galway City Ring Road application. The NTA will then review the timeline, and publication date for the GMATS when this determination has been made.  In the meantime, implementation will continue on the current Galway Transport Strategy. A significant amount of planning and design has already taken place which will enable construction activity in the coming years across active travel, bus and rail related projects including BusConnects.",
        "formatted_question": "What progress has been made on the roll-out of light rail in Galway following the publication of the feasibility study on 30 October 2024, and will a statement be made regarding this?",
        "formatted_answer": "The National Transport Authority (NTA) is collaborating with Galway City and County Councils to develop the Galway Metropolitan Area Transport Strategy (GMATS), which replaces the 2016 strategy. Feasibility studies for light rail and strategic roads are part of this process. The light rail study, published on 30 October 2024, assesses potential without selecting a specific route. It indicates feasibility under certain conditions. Future projects depend on funding and government approval. The strategic roads study is pending with An Coimisiún Pleanála after a High Court remand. The NTA is awaiting their decision before finalizing GMATS. Meanwhile, the current transport strategy continues, including BusConnects projects."

The Road Safety Authority (RSA) has successfully been running the ‘Be Safe, Be Seen’ campaign for over a decade, this has transformed road safety for pedestrians, cyclists, and motorists. As part of the campaign, the RSA distributes thousands of free high-visibility vests and armbands each year. The Government continues to support and endorse this campaign. As Active Travel becomes wider used, it is hoped that citizens will avail of the free high-visibility vests and armbands.

The NTA's Transport Strategy for the Greater Dublin Area sets out a framework for transport investment across the region over a 20-year period from 2022 to 2042. The issue of a rail connection between Dublin and Navan was re-examined as part of the development of the Transport Strategy. That re-examination supported the development of a rail line from Dublin to Navan and the final Strategy includes delivery of the line between 2031 and 2036, subject to planning and funding approvals.  I am pleased to confirm that in 2024 the NTA allocated funding to Iarnród Éireann (IÉ) for the establishment of a design team to commence work on the Navan rail line project. This work involves route option selection, planning and design phases of the project.  IÉ commenced the procurement process for this pre-construction phase of the project, and issued a tender to prequalified consultants at the end of May 2024. In November 2024, multi-disciplinary consultants RPS were appointed by IÉ for the duration of the project to work with the rail company’s in-house project team.  It is anticipated that a public consultation on the route options for the project will take place by early 2026.

Battery-electric carriages from the first order of 95 carriages have started arriving into Ireland as part of the DART+ Fleet Project. They are now undergoing testing, and are expected to be deployed on the Northern Commuter Line serving Dublin to/from Drogheda from next year. Another programme, the Cork Area Commuter Rail Programme, is also being progressed and this will help enable the future growth and electrification of the Cork rail network.  In addition to this, the NTA’s Transport Strategy for the Greater Dublin Area 2022-2042 proposes the development of a number of extensions to the current electrified Luas Network in the Greater Dublin Area, and an emerging preferred route for a Luas line in Cork recently underwent a public consultation.  Noting the NTA's responsibility for the planning and development of public transport infrastructure in the GDA and the regional cities, I have referred the Deputy's question to the NTA for a more detailed reply. Please contact my private office if you do not receive a reply within 10 days.",
        "formatted_question": "What specific actions are being coordinated between the Department of Transport, the Department of the Climate, Energy and the Environment, and EirGrid to ensure that energy infrastructure supports the electrification of public transport in the greater Dublin area and other regions?",
        "formatted_answer": "The National Transport Authority (NTA) manages the planning and development of public transport infrastructure. Over 100 double-deck electric buses are in service in Dublin, with no new diesel-only buses purchased since July 2019. The DART+ program aims to triple electrification and double capacity, with battery-electric carriages expected to deploy next year. The Cork Area Commuter Rail Programme is progressing. The NTA's Transport Strategy proposes Luas network extensions and a preferred Cork route that underwent public consultation. The question was referred to the NTA for further details."

On 14th February 2025 I announced an Exchequer investment of €713 million in our regional and local roads across the State which represents an overall increase of over 8% in funding this year. The main focus of the grants continues to be the protection and renewal of the regional and local road network.  Within the budget available to my Department, grant funding is allocated on the basis of grant programmes and not on the basis of the category of road. The allocation of funding across specific roads or across categories of road is a matter for each local authority, having regard to the funding available to it from local and central sources as well as its particular priorities.  The main Regional and Local Road Grant programmes are focussed on specific policy objectives i.e. surface sealing to protect the road surface from water damage, road strengthening based on pavement condition rating to lengthen the life of roads and a Discretionary Grant Scheme which allows for a specified range of activities including winter maintenance. These 3 grant programmes account for most of the grant funding and are allocated taking into account the length of the road network and traffic factors in a particular local authority area. Apart from a requirement that 15% of the road strengthening grant is spent on regional roads, the allocation of funding to different categories of road is entirely a matter for decision by each local authority.  In 2025, Cavan County Council received an allocation of €19,193,150 which is an increase of €1,752,840 on their 2024 allocation and Monaghan County Council received an allocation of €18,008,350 which is an increase of €1,751,255.

It is a large piece of legislation which covers multiple topics including scrambler bikes and e-scooters.  Among its many provisions, the Act aims to tackle dangerous driving and the antisocial use of scramblers and quadbikes via three key measures:  • Under Section 5(k), dangerous driving has become an offence everywhere, not only in public places;  • Under Section 5(p), An Garda Síochána were granted new powers of seizure;  • Under Section 11(b), there is a new power to provide in regulations for the prohibition or restriction of the uses of classes of vehicles in particular places.  A commencement order was signed into law (S.I. No. 392/2023) giving effect to Sections 5(k), 5(p) and 11(b), empowering An Garda Síochána to seize a vehicle (including scramblers, quadbikes and motorbikes) being driven dangerously in any location. My Department is in consultation with stakeholders in the context of preparing regulations under Section 11(b). It is important that these regulations have the desired effect, and that the correct vehicles, areas and territories are targeted.  The Road Traffic and Roads Act 2023 also legalised the use of e-scooters and a comprehensive suite of regulations has been introduced to govern the safe use of e-scooters in public places:  • The Road Traffic (Electric Scooters) Regulations 2024 (S.I. 199 of 2024) provides for technical standards and conditions for safe use, including a minimum age of 16 and a speed limit of 20 km/h.  • The Road Traffic (Signs) Regulations 2024 (S.I. 200 of 2024) provides that signs for bicycle use will also apply to e-scooters.  • The Road Traffic (Traffic and Parking) (Amendment) Regulations 2024 (S.I. 222 of 2024) provides for traffic rules, including forbidding use on motorways, footpaths and pedestrianised areas.  • The Road Traffic (Use of Powered Personal Transporters) Regulations 2024 (S.I. 224 of 2024) provides that other types of powered personal transporters (PPTs), and e-scooters which do not comply with the regulations, will remain illegal to use in public places.  • The Road Traffic Act 1994 (Detention of Powered Personal Transporters) Regulations 2024 (S.I. 223 of 2024) gives An Garda Síochána powers to seize and detain non-compliant e-scooters or other types of PPTs.  • The Road Traffic Act 2010 (Part 3) (Fixed Charge Offences) Regulations 2024 (S.I. 227 of 2024), provides for fixed charge penalties of €50.00 for certain e-scooter offences.

        "answerText": " Minister for Transport  My department has been working with Cavan and Louth County Councils in relation to funding projects associated with the proposed upgraded East West Link Road. As the Deputy is aware the proposed scheme would run on regional routes from Dundalk to Cavan and national routes from Cavan to Sligo.  Going back some time there was a proposal for a substantial upgrade of the regional road part of the route; my department provided over €2 million to Cavan County Council, acting as lead authority with Monaghan and Louth County Councils, to progress the regional road element of the project to preliminary design stage.  However, more recent appraisal work has indicated a very substantial cost if the road scheme was fully implemented. As such, my department engaged Cavan County Council to carry out a risk-based analysis for the route between Dundalk and Cavan. This analysis explored the possibility of a series of interventions which could be implemented over time, and which could improve safety, journey times, and bring consistency to the travel speed along the route. From this risk analysis individual local authorities examined if, and how, projects identified could be brought forward, while taking into account their own priorities and available resources.  My department allocated funding to both Cavan and Louth County Councils to carry out initial assessments of two possible schemes along the R178 Cavan to Dundalk Strategic Regional Route. Subsequently, both Louth and Cavan County Councils submitted Strategic Assessment Reports for these two schemes. These submissions have been reviewed and approval has been provided to advance both schemes.

        "extracted_answer": "Minister for Transport  My department has been working with Cavan and Louth County Councils in relation to funding projects associated with the proposed upgraded East West Link Road. As the Deputy is aware the proposed scheme would run on regional routes from Dundalk to Cavan and national routes from Cavan to Sligo.  Going back some time there was a proposal for a substantial upgrade of the regional road part of the route; my department provided over €2 million to Cavan County Council, acting as lead authority with Monaghan and Louth County Councils, to progress the regional road element of the project to preliminary design stage.  However, more recent appraisal work has indicated a very substantial cost if the road scheme was fully implemented. As such, my department engaged Cavan County Council to carry out a risk-based analysis for the route between Dundalk and Cavan. This analysis explored the possibility of a series of interventions which could be implemented over time, and which could improve safety, journey times, and bring consistency to the travel speed along the route. From this risk analysis individual local authorities examined if, and how, projects identified could be brought forward, while taking into account their own priorities and available resources.  My department allocated funding to both Cavan and Louth County Councils to carry out initial assessments of two possible schemes along the R178 Cavan to Dundalk Strategic Regional Route. Subsequently, both Louth and Cavan County Councils submitted Strategic Assessment Reports for these two schemes. These submissions have been reviewed and approval has been provided to advance both schemes.  The department has provided further funding in 2025 to both Cavan County Council and Louth County Council to advance these schemes through to the end of Phase 2 “Route Selection”. This process is underway by the local authorities and following completion, a further review of both schemes will be examined by my department before approval to the next phase.",

        "formatted_answer": "The Department has allocated over €2 million to Cavan County Council, in collaboration with Monaghan and Louth County Councils, for the preliminary design of a proposed road upgrade. A subsequent appraisal highlighted significant costs, prompting a risk-based analysis to explore phased interventions. This analysis allowed local authorities to assess project feasibility based on their priorities and resources. Further funding was provided in 2025 to both Cavan and Louth County Councils for initial assessments of two schemes on the R178 route. Strategic Assessment Reports were submitted, reviewed, and approved, advancing both schemes to Phase 2 (\"Route Selection\"). The process is ongoing, with a future review planned before proceeding to the next phase."

However, I am not involved in the day-to-day operations of public transport. The National Transport Authority (NTA) has responsibility for the regulation of fares charged to passengers in respect of public transport services provided under public service obligation (PSO) contracts.  In April 2023, the NTA published a new National Fares Strategy, aiming to deliver a more consistent, equitable, and transparent fare structure for all passengers. Following this, the NTA commenced a phased rollout of revised fare zones and structures. Phase 1 of this Fares Determination was implemented in June 2024, focusing on fare changes for towns and shorter journeys within Dublin.As the Deputy may be aware, the second part of this Determination is being implemented in two phases: Phase 2A (commenced from Monday, 28 April 2025) introduced new multi-modal fare caps in Dublin and revised commuter rail fares; and Phase 2B (commenced from Monday, 16 June 2025) for revised commuter bus fares. It is the NTA’s intention to roll out further changes in future determinations during 2025, designed to deliver a fares approach that is easier for customers to understand.Alongside this, Budget 2025 includes funding for the continuation of popular public transport fare initiatives including the 90-minute fare, the Young Adult/Student Leap Card, and the discounted fares on PSO services, with further provision to extend child fares to include those ages 5-8 years of age in Q3 of this year.

        "extracted_answer": "Minister for Transport  As Minister for Transport, I have responsibility for policy and overall funding in relation to public transport. However, I am not involved in the day-to-day operations of public transport. The National Transport Authority (NTA) has responsibility for the regulation of fares charged to passengers in respect of public transport services provided under public service obligation (PSO) contracts.  In April 2023, the NTA published a new National Fares Strategy, aiming to deliver a more consistent, equitable, and transparent fare structure for all passengers. Following this, the NTA commenced a phased rollout of revised fare zones and structures. Phase 1 of this Fares Determination was implemented in June 2024, focusing on fare changes for towns and shorter journeys within Dublin.As the Deputy may be aware, the second part of this Determination is being implemented in two phases: Phase 2A (commenced from Monday, 28 April 2025) introduced new multi-modal fare caps in Dublin and revised commuter rail fares; and Phase 2B (commenced from Monday, 16 June 2025) for revised commuter bus fares. It is the NTA’s intention to roll out further changes in future determinations during 2025, designed to deliver a fares approach that is easier for customers to understand.Alongside this, Budget 2025 includes funding for the continuation of popular public transport fare initiatives including the 90-minute fare, the Young Adult/Student Leap Card, and the discounted fares on PSO services, with further provision to extend child fares to include those ages 5-8 years of age in Q3 of this year.  My Department supports these measures in line with the recent commitment in the Programme for Government to keeping fares low and affordable.In light of the NTA's responsibility in this area, I have forwarded the Deputy's question to the NTA for direct reply. Please advise my private office if you do not receive a response within ten working days.",
        "formatted_question": "Will the National Transport Authority consider implementing a maximum Leap card fare in regional cities, similar to the €2 90-minute fare in Dublin, as part of the National Fare Strategy?",
        "formatted_answer": "The National Transport Authority (NTA) is responsible for setting public transport fares. They published the National Fares Strategy in April 2023, implementing changes in three phases: Phase 1 in June 2024 focused on Dublin, Phase 2A in April 2025 introduced fare caps and rail fare adjustments, and Phase 2B in June 2025 addressed bus fares. Future phases are scheduled for 2025. Budget 2025 supports initiatives like the 90-minute fare, student Leap Cards, and discounted fares, including extending child fares to ages 5-8 by Q3 2025. The question has been referred to the NTA for further response."

This regulation standardises social statistics across EU member states to ensure comparability of data on income, poverty, social exclusion, and living conditions.

This definition excludes people living in collective or institutional settings, such as:  ·Emergency or long-term homeless accommodation  ·Direct provision centres  ·Nursing homes, hospitals, or prisons  ·Traveller halting sites not classed as private households  This methodological limitation means that small groups of the population, including Travellers and Roma, migrants in communal accommodation, people with disabilities in institutional care, and homeless individuals, are often underrepresented in the SILC achieved sample or entirely excluded from the SILC sample frame. As a result, national statistics on income poverty, material deprivation, and social exclusion may not fully capture the circumstances of these population groups.
