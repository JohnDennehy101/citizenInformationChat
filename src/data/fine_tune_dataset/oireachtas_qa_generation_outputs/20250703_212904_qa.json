Under the legislation, all adults in Ireland are considered to have agreed to be an organ donor when they die unless they have recorded a decision not to donate on the Relevant Organ Donation Opt-Out Register or are in one of the excluded groups. It is important to reassure people that family members will always be consulted before any action is taken. This is commonly referred to as a soft opt-out organ donation system.  Families will continue to be consulted as part of a safe and respectful organ donation process, while the wishes of the deceased should be central to any decision.  Most people in Ireland are in favour of organ donation, and the new system changes the default assumption to one that matches the prevailing public attitude regarding organ donation. Meanwhile, the Register is intended to ensure that a person’s right to autonomy, self-determination and bodily integrity is respected.  The wishes of those on the Register will be respected in full, and their family will not be approached on the issue of organ donation. This objection applies to the relevant organs under the Act, namely, the liver, lung, pancreas, heart or kidney.  I have been informed by the Health Service Executive that as of Friday 20 June 2025, 29,394 persons have registered their objection to becoming an organ donor since the Register was made available to the public.  The Act introduces the concept of the designated family member i.e. the person who will be consulted regarding consent or confirmation of no objection to donation. The Designated Family Member Guidelines have been published which outline the role of the designated family member in the context of consent under Part 2 of the Act and the conditions which must be met.  Part 2 also expands pathways for living organ donations to include non-directed altruistic donation allowing living donors to donate to the transplantation system rather than to a specific person.  Finally, the Human Tissue (Transplantation, Post-Mortem, Anatomical Examination and Public Display) (Living Donor Reimbursement Scheme) Regulations 2025 have been introduced to place the Living Donor Reimbursement Scheme on a statutory footing. To date, the policy has been operated on a non-statutory basis. The intention is to minimise financial disincentives for potential living organ donors, with a view to ensuring the pool of living donors continued to expand. The policy is based on the premise that although reimbursement may be granted, such reimbursement cannot confer any financial reward on a potential donor. ",

        "answerText": " Minister for Health  GPs are self-employed practitioners, most of whom hold a GMS contract with the HSE to provide medical services to medical card and GP visit card holders on their behalf. GPs who hold a GMS contract are reimbursed for the services they provide through capitation payments and fee-per-item payments for certain services. Practices also receive a range of financial supports.  Under the GMS scheme, the financial supports available to eligible GPs/GP practices include practice staff supports, locum contributions for leave taking, rural practice supports, and a support for practices in urban areas of deprivation. A contribution to GMS GPs medical indemnity insurance is also paid.  Regarding practice staff supports, GPs are paid a subsidy towards the cost of employing a practice nurse and/or a practice secretary. The rate payable depends on the GP's GMS panel size and the level of experience of the nurse or secretary concerned. A practice manager subsidy is also available. The rate of these subsidies was increased under the 2023 GP Agreement. The 2023 agreement added General Practice Assistant to the staff subsidies, and introduced a new support grant for additional staff capacity as well as a staff support for the taking of maternity leave.  Eligible GMS GPs are provided with locum contributions for various types of leave taking, such as annual leave, sick leave, and study leave. The contribution rates may vary by type and duration, per day or per week, with the locum contribution rates for maternity and paternity leave doubled under the 2019 GP Agreement.  GMS GPs working in rural areas who meet the qualifying criteria receive an annual rural practice support allowance under the Rural Practice Support Framework. The 2019 GP Agreement increased the practice support package for rural GP practices by 10%. Practices in receipt of rural practice supports attract the maximum allowable rates for practice staff support subsidies and locum contributions for leave taking.  Furthermore, a new locum support initiative commenced in May, providing GPs in receipt of rural practice supports with access to a streamlined locum sourcing service. While the GPs themselves will cover the cost of the locum, the HSE will bear the cost of securing the locum. The initiative specifically targets the 239 GPs currently receiving rural practice supports, with an initial focus on the over 130 single-handed GPs working in isolated areas, who often face the greatest challenges in finding cover.  The 2019 GP Agreement also introduced a €2 million per annum support for GP practices in disadvantaged urban areas. The funding may be used for additional health personnel costs or for the provision of additional services.  Other than the practice supports provided under the GMS scheme, financial supports specific to newly qualified GPs are not provided. As part of the underway Strategic Review of General Practice, consideration is to be given to the development of the support model necessary to underpin the provision of GP services in the context of the Sláintecare vision of universal GP access. Following its completion, a final report will be presented to me outlining the findings of the review and setting out recommended actions for a more sustainable general practice. ",

Subsidies for practice nurses, secretaries, and managers vary based on panel size and experience, with increases implemented in 2023.

Currently there are 2,558 GPs contracted to provide services under the GMS Scheme. A further 629 GPs do not hold a GMS contract but do hold at least one other contract with the HSE.

Significant increases in investment in general practice have been provided under the 2019 and 2023 GP Agreements. Under the 2019 GP Agreement additional annual expenditure provided for general practice was increased by €211.6m. This provides for increased capitation fees for participating GMS GPs, new fees for additional services and increased practice supports.  The 2019 GP Agreement also introduced a grant for urban practices with large numbers of GMS patients living in disadvantaged areas. The grant can be used to provide for additional services for patients and additional staff hours. Over 300 GPs received this grant last year.  The GP Agreement 2023 further increased GP capitation fees, increased the existing subsidy rates for practice staff, and introduced a grant support for additional staff capacity as well a practice staff maternity leave support.  Annual intake to the GP training scheme has been increased by approximately 80% from 2019 to 2024, with 350 new entrant training places made available from 2024. As a result, the number of GP graduates has increased in recent years and will continue to increase in the coming years. Furthermore, recruitment of GPs from abroad is ongoing under the International Medical Graduate (IMG) Rural GP Programme. 118 IMG doctors are currently in practice here with a further 18 having completed the new 2-year programme. The placement of IMG GPs is targeted to rural and underserved areas.  Lastly, a Strategic Review of General Practice is underway. The review, with input from key stakeholders, is examining the broad range of issues affecting general practice including issues related to GP capacity and will consider possible mechanisms to attract GPs to rural and underserved areas.

Annual intake to the GP training scheme has been increased by approximately 80% from 2019 to 2024, with 350 new entrant training places made available from 2024. As a result, the number of GP graduates has increased in recent years and will continue to increase in the coming years. Furthermore, recruitment of GPs from abroad is ongoing under the International Medical Graduate (IMG) Rural GP Programme. 118 IMG doctors are currently in practice here with a further 18 having completed the new 2-year programme. The placement of IMG GPs is targeted to rural and underserved areas.  Lastly, a Strategic Review of General Practice is underway. The review, with input from key stakeholders, is examining the broad range of issues affecting general practice including issues related to GP capacity and will consider possible mechanisms to attract GPs to rural and underserved areas. Following its completion, a final report will be presented to me outlining the findings of the review and setting out recommended actions for a more sustainable general practice.",

They went beyond the call of duty, working in front-line environments, treating COVID-19 positive patients, particularly in the early days when the control measures that we now take for granted were not yet in place.  In response to this, a Temporary Special Scheme was put in place for 12 months in July 2022 to support eligible staff who were impacted by Long-COVID in the public health sector.  The intention of this scheme was to support those employees working in COVID-19 environments in the time before PPE and vaccinations were readily available.  It is my understanding that there are approximately 159 employees currently on the Special Scheme, the majority of whom have been supported on full pay for almost 5 years now.  My Department has always worked hard to ensure supports have been in place for those workers impacted by long-COVID, and at our request, the Department of Public Expenditure, Infrastructure, Public Service Reform and Digitalisation (DPER), have agreed to extend the scheme on four occasions already, most recently at the end of June 2024 when it was extended for a further 12 months for the existing cohort of employees already being supported by it.  However, I understand DPER have been clear that this is the final extension that would be granted, and as such, the Special Scheme will conclude on 30th June 2025.  I would like to re-assure those 159 employees who have been supported by the scheme for up to 5 years now, that they will continue to be supported, and the full provisions of the Public Service Sick Leave Scheme will apply for anyone who remains unable to return to work.  The sick leave scheme provides:  - Full pay for three months  - Half pay for three months, followed by:  - Temporary Rehabilitative Remuneration (TRR) can provide up to a further 547 days of paid leave.  - The Critical Illness Protocol that forms part of the sick leave scheme may also provide additional supports for up to 3 years.

However, HIQA has recently updated me of a revised timeline for completion of the final report, which is now expected to be September 2025.  Overall, the HIQA work on the review of urgent and emergency healthcare services in the Mid West region has progressed very well and the workstreams undertaken by HIQA to inform the advice to me, as Minister, are complete. A critical dependency for completion of the advice and a final report from HIQA is the input from the national and regional demand and capacity projections being undertaken by the ESRI for the Department.  The first of these three ESRI reports, on projections of national demand and bed capacity requirements for public acute hospitals, was published on 28 May 2025. The second report, on future capacity requirements for GP services, was published on 18 June 2025. The third report, on older persons care, will be published shortly. The ESRI will also publish further regional analysis over the coming months.  HIQA have updated me that, given the ESRI regional capacity projections work will not be completed until later in the summer, this will impact on the timeframe for delivery of HIQA’s final report and advice.  The revised timeline for completion of the HIQA final report will therefore be September 2025, contingent on the completion of the ESRI reports within the expected timeframe.  The completed workstreams by HIQA include:  • review of the national policy landscape;  • analysis of relevant health system data;  • regulatory inspections of UHL and of other hospitals and services in the Mid West;  • substantial stakeholder engagement including a public consultation which received 1,121 submissions; and  • a number of international evidence syntheses targeted to address relevant research questions have been undertaken.

This has funded 2 supra-regional tertiary centres and five supporting regional hubs. The supra-regional centres are managed from Cork University Maternity Hospital and Tallaght University Hospital. Regional hubs operate from the Rotunda Hospital, the Coombe Hospital, the National Maternity Hospital, University Maternity Hospital Limerick and University Hospital Galway. Specialist sites are staffed by multidisciplinary teams delivering a patient centred service.  This investment has ensured that women with endometriosis can receive the level of care they need. The five regional hubs are accepting referrals for specialist services. Supra-regional sites are accepting referrals for complex, severe cases of endometriosis.  Over 1,150 new patients were seen through our specialist endometriosis services in 2024. More than 300 surgical interventions were provided between August and December 2024. On average, 72% of women on specialist endometriosis waiting lists were seen within 6 months in that time.  Investment in the waiting list action plan has positively impacted waiting times. In May 2025, 78% of women on the gynaecology waiting list were waiting less than 6 months. This compares to 55% in September 2021, when the waiting list action plan was introduced.  €2.175 million has been allocated to our specialist endometriosis services in 2025. Recruitment of 18.6 Whole Time Equivalents is ongoing. This investment underpins the Programme for Government commitment to continue to expand specialist services in endometriosis.

        "answerText": " Deputy Robert O'Donoghue  Will the Minister outline when he expects to get the findings of the independent review into the night-time economy? Does he anticipate the findings will recommend that a night-time adviser is appointed to each of the county councils? \n Minister for Culture, Communications and Sport (Deputy Patrick O'Donovan)  I thank the Deputy. In support of action 19 in the report of the night-time economy task force and as part of the Department's key role in driving the night-time economy in Ireland, we are funding nine night-time economy advisers in Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Galway, Kilkenny, Sligo, Longford, Buncrana and Drogheda.  The night-time economy pilots are a significant project within the night-time economy policy area and arguably one of the most impactful. This year, I have allocated just under €1.4 million in funding to support these pilots to cover salary costs and a funding package to roll out their plans, including support for Culture Night Late and Cruinniú Late.  The advisers are helping to drive and support a more sustainable night-time economy in their local areas. The Department engages with them regularly and supports their development. They also work collaboratively on larger projects, which have included a late-night transport campaign in partnership with the National Transport Authority and a late-night safety campaign. Each is responsible for developing specific action plans for their own areas. The Department has detailed service level agreements with each local authority setting out key objectives and deliverables.  Following a competitive tendering process in 2024, Communiqué International was appointed to conduct a review of the nine night-time economy pilots to look critically at the structures involved in supporting the advisers, the visibility and impact of each in their respective areas, the future roll-out of the pilots, whether a further roll-out is warranted and what needs to be put in place.  I understand that the review of the pilots has now concluded and the subsequent report is due to be finalised very shortly. The report will detail a set of recommendations in respect of the future of the pilots. I have not seen the report yet as it is not finalised and, therefore, I am not in a position to comment about what the findings are likely to be. Once the report is received, we will undertake a consultation exercise with the County and City Management Association and the wider night-time economy implementation group about the recommendations on the future roll-out, prior to publication. I expect publication to take place soon after that. \n Deputy Robert O'Donoghue  It is good to hear support for the plan, especially in respect of public transport, which is a particular difficulty outside Dublin when people try to get in and out to venues in cities.  I attended the launch of the report from the Give Us The Night campaign yesterday. Its members have been campaigning for reform of the Irish nightclub industry for more than 20 years. Parts of that industry are still regulated by the 1935 Public Dance Halls Act. We need renewal in the nightlife sector. It is in a bad way. There are 23 nightclubs in all of Dublin and none in the north of the county. Shenanigans in Skerries is long gone. This needs to be addressed and discussed.  I would also like to mention the Oireachtas broadcast unit workers and their precarious employment. I urge the Minister to meet them, if he can. Their dispute seems to have cross-party support. It would nice for them to be heard. \n Deputy Patrick O'Donovan  I thank the Deputy. The Oireachtas broadcasting unit, as the Deputy knows, is a matter for the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission. All parties are represented at that commission. Those are ultimately the people who have responsibility for the operation and running of the Oireachtas. It would not be appropriate for me to cut across the Ceann Comhairle and members of the Oireachtas commission.  In response to the comments the Deputy made about the night-time economy, much progress has been made in this space. During the week, for instance, the Government made a decision to establish a Dublin task force. This is not just a Dublin issue. It is an issue that relates to small towns and villages and other regional centres. I was glad to hear the Deputy reference the improvements that have been made to public transport. That is encouraging, although more in that space needs to be done. I see it in my own area. The Government has made significant investments in rural transport. All of that, together with the review of the report once I have finished it and can lay it before the House, will add substantially to the whole night-time economy. \n Deputy Robert O'Donoghue  I thank the Minister. We can work on this issue on a cross-party basis. I thank him for his contribution and look forward to the publication of the report. \n Deputy Patrick O'Donovan  I acknowledge the Deputy's support for the sector. He has been consistent in his remarks. ",

        "answerText": " Deputy Aengus Ó Snodaigh  This question relates to the process undertaken for deciding on the success of grant applications for the grassroots music venues support scheme funding. Was regional dispersal of awards considered? Will the Minister make a statement on the matter? \n Deputy Patrick O'Donovan  I thank the Deputy. I launched the grassroots music venues support scheme in March this year to support small and established music venues that promote themselves and are known in the community for programming grassroots music artists, in recognition of the contribution they make to the music industry and the wider night-time economy. The support scheme aims to provide employment opportunities for emerging artists and professionals, including production staff and crew, who are dependent on live performances. The scheme operated with a total fund of €500,000 and grants were available of up to a maximum of €15,000 to host events showcasing the talent of emerging grassroots artists performing live music that they have written or created themselves.  A total of 96 applications were received by the Department and assessed strictly in accordance with the guidelines of the scheme. In line with the published criteria, applications were processed by my officials strictly by order of date and time of receipt, that is, on a first come, first served basis. In addition, venues had to meet the eligibility criteria in order to qualify for funding. Venues had to demonstrate that they promote themselves and are known in the community as an established live music venue or dance venue with grassroots music performance forming a core part of their programming. The venues had to operate with a capacity of 500 or less. Venues were also required to submit evidence, in the form of promotional material, photographic evidence and ticket sales, of a strong track record over two years, 2023 and 2024, of regularly programming grassroots music events.  Applications were, as I said, assessed on a first come, first served basis. While regional dispersal of the awards was not considered as part of the assessment process, I am satisfied that the grants awarded demonstrate a good regional spread. In addition, the important feedback and insights gained from this pilot edition of the scheme will help inform us of any future decisions in respect of the scheme.  I understand that some people might be disappointed, as I have already said. I recognise the value of this scheme to venues across the country and I am committed to considering another phase of this support in the not-too-distant future. \n Deputy Aengus Ó Snodaigh  The main question here is whether applicants were aware when they submitted their applications that the scheme was run on a first come, first served basis. In March this year, the application process closed. There were 96 applicants, some of whom, although we do not know how many, did not qualify. Only 33 applicants were granted any money from the pot. Even though €5,000 or up to €15,000 could be allocated, every one of the applicants whose application was granted received the maximum amount. There is still a shortfall of €5,000 in the fund, which could have been allocated but seems not to have been. The main question is whether any of the applicants know before others about the secret change. There was no indication in advance that this was going to be allocated on a first come, first served basis. \n Deputy Patrick O'Donovan  The Deputy will appreciate it was a pilot scheme that had a relatively small amount of money available and attracted considerable interest. The officials in my Department had to ascribe a basis for the allocation of the moneys, as I have outlined. They also had to cut it off at a certain point because there was no point in continuing secula seculorum . We will be doing this again and will have regard to those who were unsuccessful this time around. I hope to build the scheme into the budget for 2026 at a much higher level. We will take account of the findings from the initial tranche of the pilot.  Hopefully, it will be put on a much more concrete basis in future, akin to something like the sports capital grants, where it will be done regularly. I want to try to support as many as I can and I want to support the smaller ones in particular. This was a first stab at it. In fairness to the officials in the Department, they did their best with a very small amount of money. \n Deputy Aengus Ó Snodaigh  I welcome the money, as does the industry. The Minister mentioned the sports capital grants. It would be chaotic if that scheme were to be run on a first come, first served basis. When opening and closing dates are issued, all the applicants have to be assessed case-by-case based on their qualifications. The Minister or the officials can then put them in whatever order will be acceptable. This would be in contrast to saying in the middle of an application scheme, however, that it is first come, first served and hard luck to all those after number 33 that do not qualify. This seems to have been the case in this regard rather than looking to see if the money could be divided up in a more equal way, or perhaps even look at a regional distribution. The fact no venue north of Galway or west of Louth got any of the funding suggests something else is going on here. I welcome that the Minister is going to run this scheme again, but I ask him to please examine it and run it in a different way from what it looks like was done in this instance. \n Deputy Patrick O'Donovan  Regarding the previous question Deputy O'Donoghue raised, it will be appreciated by Deputy Ó Snodaigh that a small town like Buncrana has a night-time economy adviser that the Department made provision for. Many towns in Ireland that are much bigger than Buncrana do not have one. This is the basis of pilots. There will always be disappointment but once the pilots are concluded, that will give us an opportunity to take lessons from the scheme. I compared this to the sports capital grant. I know what the Deputy said was a bit tongue-in-cheek and he appreciates I would not ask anybody to divvy out €350 million on a first come, first served basis. This is €500,000. It is a start. It is regrettable that the party opposite is trying to undermine and pick holes in a scheme that, ultimately, I am trying to get into the budget. It has been welcomed by the night-time economy and the venues. Ultimately, there is disappointment. There was going to be disappointment when there was only €500,000 but I hope to be able to allay that disappointment in future. Rather than having a go at the scheme, it might be a more productive use of time to see if there were suggestions the party opposite might propose for the scheme in future. \n Deputy Aengus Ó Snodaigh  I gave the Minister the suggestion that he not do it on a first come, first served basis. There is a basis that I outlined, so I ask him not to misrepresent what I said. I welcomed the fact that this was going to happen and also welcomed him indicating he was going to have another grant scheme. ",

        "formatted_answer": "The grassroots music venues support scheme, launched in March, allocated a total fund of €500,000 with grants up to €15,000 each. A total of 96 applications were received, and 33 were approved, each receiving the maximum grant amount. The selection process was based on a first-come, first-served basis, following the scheme's guidelines. Eligibility criteria included promoting grassroots music, a venue capacity of 500 or fewer, and a two-year track record of hosting such events. Regional dispersal was not a criterion, but the approved grants are believed to show a good regional spread. The scheme is a pilot, with plans for another phase. There was a €5,000 shortfall in the fund."

Will the Minister read the writing on the wall, scrap this regressive tax and replace it with a levy on big tech corporations? \n Deputy Patrick O'Donovan  The question is whether I will abolish the television licence and replace it with a tax. No, I will not. That is the end of that. I have no notion of doing it. That fund is in place to support RTÉ and public service broadcasters. It also supports Sound and Vision. I have no intention of replacing it. I also have no intention of going down a cul-de-sac as the Deputy would like us to do, which would be a road to nowhere for RTÉ and everyone associated with broadcasting. The short answer is \"No\". \n Deputy Paul Murphy  I thank the Minister. I presume he accepts that the tax is deeply unpopular. Licence sales have plummeted since the Tubridy scandal and everything else that came out in terms of the behaviour of those at the top of RTÉ. In 2022, €950,000 was paid. This dropped to €825,000 in 2023 and €790,000 in 2024. This represents a drop of more than 155,000 households that are refusing to pay, either in protest or because they cannot afford to pay this regressive flat tax that takes no account of ability to pay.  I suspect that RTÉ's appalling coverage of the genocide in Gaza has contributed to the further drop in people buying TV licences, when RTÉ often continues to use a both sides framing of what is a horrifically asymmetrical conflict in using terminology like \"Hamas-run health ministry\" and providing platforms for representatives of the genocidal Israeli State. \n Deputy Patrick O'Donovan  I am here to answer questions regarding communications, so I will answer the question on communications. There was not really a question in the Deputy's second contribution. My position remains the same. The television licence is not a tax, by the way. I do not see that reference anywhere in the legislation, so I do not know what hat he drew that rabbit out of. It is an important funding mechanism for RTÉ. The Deputy would be the very first person out in RTÉ protesting if the Government were to in any way reduce funding to it. He wants to have his cake and eat it. On this, I am not going to go down the cul-de-sac where he just wants to erode the tax base of every element of public expenditure and revenue generation. He seems to think there is a phantom entity out there that can pay for everything bar yourself. That is the way he operates. In the real world of a constitutional democracy, that is not the way things work. If he ever gets the opportunity to spend a day in government, maybe he will realise that. \n Deputy Paul Murphy  The Minister might tell us if considers all the countries across Europe that have abolished TV licences not to be constitutional democracies. Is the test of being a constitutional democracy having a TV licence? He might clarify that. I presume he is aware that just over one third of funding for RTÉ and public service broadcasting comes from the TV licence. It is not even where a majority of funding comes from. The Minister may not be aware of our proposals in RTÉ for the People: A Radical Plan to Transform RTÉ and Public Media, which would increase funding for public service broadcasting, and takes on board many of the recommendations of Coimisiún na Meán and does so not by imposing this regressive flat tax on ordinary households, but on the big tech corporations making huge profits. I do not know if the Minister is aware of this fact. I do not know if he is aware of the parasitical role these corporations play on journalism, where they are not creating any of this content but getting most of the advertising revenue from it. It clearly makes sense, therefore, to allow those companies to pay. I will continue to support those who refuse to pay the TV licence. I warn the Minister this number is increasing. It seems even An Post has given up pursuing people, if we look at the number of prosecutions, which are also dropping. \n Deputy Patrick O'Donovan  The Deputy is no stranger to RTÉ and he gets a fair crack of the whip there. Of course, he never uses the opportunity to express his thanks for the unbridled coverage he seems to get from RTÉ on a day in, day out basis. Those of us on this side of the House might have something to complain about if there was a fairness test. I do not, however, because it is a public service broadcaster and I am not going to interfere in editorial coverage. \n Deputy Paul Murphy  It sounds like the Minister is interfering now. \n Deputy Patrick O'Donovan  The Deputy has form in this space. He does not want to pay for anything. He feels that everybody else should pay for something else other than him. He is entitled to start whatever campaign it is he wants to start to undermine another public service. I do not wish him the best of luck with it. Most people do not either. When he does get an opportunity to sit on this side of the House, with whoever it is that will actually have him as a partner in government, he will then see there is more to running a public service than a megaphone.

        "answerText": " Deputy Peadar Tóibín  I was sorry to hear about the Minister's ill health recently and I wish him the best of luck with it in future too. The basic income for the arts scheme is an initiative we in Aontú have supported for many years. Many artists live in poverty and deprivation and have lives full of economic anxiety. The basic income for the arts scheme is designed to reduce that deprivation and to help artists to create. Will the scheme be expanded in a manner that will encompass more than the current 2,000 recipients of this income? \n Deputy Patrick O'Donovan  I thank the Deputy for the question and for his remarks at the start of his contribution. The programme for Government commits to assessing the basic income for the arts pilot research scheme to maximise its impact. I appreciate the importance of the basic income support for artists, which is why last week I announced that the Cabinet had agreed to my proposal to an extension of six months to allow further evaluation of the pilot data. This will also give sufficient time to engage in stakeholder consultation and to evaluate the data which will provide the evidence base for Government to make decisions on the next steps.  The primary objective of the scheme is to help artists deal with the precarious incomes and to prevent talent from leaving the sector for economic reasons. Evaluation of the pilot is and has been continuous, with participants completing a detailed survey every six months. The Department has been undertaking a comprehensive research programme based on this data. I am aware that there is broad-based support for the scheme, and I recently met with the National Campaign for the Arts to discuss the scheme. I intend to bring proposals for a permanent intervention to Cabinet as part of budget 2026 based on the evidence arising from the research programme and stakeholder engagement.  The current scheme costs just under €35 million per year to provide the payment to 2,000 recipients. The cost of a six-month extension is €16.7 million.  The net overall cost of the pilot scheme to the Exchequer is likely to be less, given the high number of recipients who were previously on social welfare supports prior to the scheme. A cost-benefit analysis currently under way should bring further clarity to the overall costs.  While the research phase of the pilot scheme is still ongoing, it is clear from evidence collected to date under the scheme that it is having a positive impact on participants. The scheme support is hugely valued by artists in receipt of it. It has been the subject of much positive commentary both at home and abroad and makes an important statement about the value that the Government and Ireland place on the arts. A Government decision will be required on a successor scheme once the research is concluded. \n Deputy Peadar Tóibín  First of all, it is interesting that we do not know the net cost. We know the cost but many of these recipients were on social welfare previously.  I ask the Minister to speak to the other aspect of this, namely, the impact it is having on the creative sector at present.  Much of the study, and the information, has been on the 2,000 recipients but there is a control group of 6,000 other individuals who applied for this income. I would be interested to know how those in the control group are experiencing being an artist in an economically difficult situation. If that information was available to the Opposition, it would be an important part of the discussion and the development of this fund. It is worrisome that there is no evidence as yet - maybe it is the Minister's plan - that the scheme will be expanded to the other 6,000 people who have applied for this. There are few income supports that are given at random to a small sample of the people who need them. Most income supports are given to everybody who needs them. \n Deputy Patrick O'Donovan  I agree with the Deputy, to be honest about it. It has shone a light on the precarious nature of the income, which was the initial overriding consideration my predecessor had when this scheme was brought in. Not everybody was enthusiastic about this scheme when it was brought in but, qualitatively and quantitatively, when we have the research concluded, it will demonstrate in a clear way that this is a good scheme.  Ultimately, I would love to be able to broaden it, but it will be resource dependent in the context of the budget. First of all, I will have to get Cabinet approval for its continuation as a scheme. The amount of funding that will be made available to it will obviously be a determining factor in respect of the number of people we will be able to support. We will also have to have consideration, as the Deputy rightly said, for those who would have loved to be part of the initial scheme but who, unfortunately, for one reason or another, were not.  There is a bit to roll on this yet but the most important thing is that the Government, the Department and I, as Minister, are committed to it. \n Deputy Peadar Tóibín  One of the difficulties is that for many, in reality, being an artist is synonymous with poverty. While now and again on the news or in the newspapers we see people who do economically well from their art, they are a tiny minority of that group. Historically, we know of artists who died as paupers only to have their art appreciated after their deaths. It is important that there is an understanding of the value of the work artists do in reflecting back to society who we are and what we are about. There should be space given for that cohort of individuals to be able to create and produce their work.  I ask the Minister that any information he currently has on the impact of the fund on the creativity of the 2,000 artists who are in receipt of it, but also any of the qualitative analysis of the control group, be given to the Opposition as soon as possible or published in order that we can understand the benefits better. \n Deputy Patrick O'Donovan  I will take the last part first. Once I have had an opportunity to digest the material - the Deputy would accept that is not unreasonable - it will give me an opportunity to make further decisions. As regards the result of the analysis and the possible publication, we want to be sensitive to people's individual identities, etc. I do not want to compromise people one way or another. I also am conscious, as I stated, that there is a number of people who did not get to participate on the scheme.  It is important to point out that even outside of the scheme there is significant support being provided by my Department, indirectly or directly, to the arts. The total budget for the Arts Council is of the order of €140 million. This is not insignificant. It has grown quite large over the past number of years under successive Ministers and we hope to be able to continue that trajectory during the lifetime of the Government. ",

        "answerText": " Deputy John Connolly  There is a very progressive commitment in the programme for Government to support local authorities in the acquisition of new lands for parks and playing pitches to help build liveable communities. We all know the importance of active recreational spaces. Have efforts commenced to develop a strategy around that commitment? \n Deputy Charlie McConalogue  I thank the Deputy for raising this matter. I know it is something he is committed to. We have spoken about it before. Encouraging clubs to collaborate particularly with local authorities under a municipal approach could deliver significant benefits to sporting organisations and opportunities for people in local communities to engage in sport across the country and, from the Deputy’s perspective, in County Galway in particular.  We all know the importance of sport to the well-being and health of our local communities. The availability and ease of access to sports facilities is central to that, whether in a club setting, on public lands or in other amenity areas. Planning for future facilities needs, locations and types is a particular focus of our current sports action plan. In the past, there was not a particular weighting in the sports capital grants towards municipal facilities. There has been support where people are collaborating but, with the sports capital grants reopening next spring, we will look at how we can try to incentivise clubs to come together and, indeed, local authorities to work together too to support that objective.  Accessing land is a particular challenge, especially in some of our cities but also across the country. This is something we will reflect on. There is no funding for land at the moment but we want to develop and structure the next sports capital grants in a way that incentivises people to come together, particularly in respect of existing land that local authorities have, as well as looking at land that schools might have. Secondary or primary schools that need sporting facilities might have land and we can encourage them to collaborate with local sporting clubs in a way that maximises and leverages the investment for everyone in the community and makes sure it is accessible at different times of day. I look forward to engaging with the Deputy further on any ideas he has on how we can best do that. We want to make a real impact through this approach. \n Deputy John Connolly  The Minister of State noted many of the challenges that sports groups and local authorities meet in the development of facilities. The programme for Government also includes a complementary commitment to conduct a nationwide audit of sports facilities to address shortages in areas where there is a population of over 1,500. The audit will probably find a deficit in the provision of playing spaces in urban areas. I am not familiar with the locations but I have heard from some of my colleagues and from the media that there are significant parts of Dublin city which have no active recreational spaces for clubs to pursue their interests. That is something we need to challenge. It also happens outside Dublin. The demand for land has led to increased pressure in terms of its price. That makes it difficult for voluntary clubs to be able to purchase the land, as the Minister of State noted in his response. The viability of buying land for sporting clubs in our major urban areas is a really significant challenge. \n Deputy Charlie McConalogue  We have asked Sport Ireland to conduct an exercise to assess gaps in particular sporting facilities around the country in order that we get an overall sense of what the facilities are in different areas and are able to factor that into our future sports capital considerations and announcements. My experience, and I am sure the Deputy’s too, is that almost all clubs across all sports are under pressure for space. We had seen very significant uptake in participation, with a significant closing of the gender gap in terms of female participation, which is really important, as well as across age groups and youth participation in many different sports. However, that is putting pressure on playing facilities. I rarely visit a sports club which is comfortable with the space and facilities it has for the demand it has. We need to continue to invest across all sports but we also need to look at where the acute needs are and factor that into the considerations. The work Sport Ireland is doing will be important in informing us around that. \n Deputy John Connolly  The GAA has done a lot of analysis of its activities in different parts of the country. It is concerned about the future organisation of the GAA in some urban communities because the lack of playing space will limit its ability to undertake activities and increase its membership among new communities. That is worth noting in this debate. As a concrete example, in 2017 Galway City Council developed the Kingston master plan for an area quite close to where I live. It was to include playgrounds, changing rooms, outdoor gym equipment, pedestrian walkway, cycle paths, a pitch and ancillary facilities. We are yet to see that go to planning. We have been talking about it for eight years but, due to the challenge of financing it and some of the land not yet being in local authority ownership, it has not come to fruition.  The Minister of State noted the challenge of purchasing land not currently covered by the sports capital grant. We could have something like the Housing Finance Agency for local authorities to allow them to draw down long-term loans at low interest rates for the purchase of land specifically for community and sporting facilities. \n Deputy Charlie McConalogue  We will look at all of this. I want to ensure that our local authorities are thinking seriously about sporting facilities in their planning for an area and their use of land, particularly existing land. I also want to ensure our schools are thinking about how they can collaborate with sporting clubs. While land is a challenge, there is a lot of latent potential in the land we have. In the past, we did not put enough focus on getting people to co-operate and collaborate and to think how they can work together to develop facilities. We will be considering that very strongly in advance of decisions on the structure of the next sports capital grant, along with consideration of where the acute gaps are.  Deputy Connolly has been speaking to me on a number of projects in Galway. He wants to see real progress there and he has ideas about how we can try to promote this. I look forward to working and engaging with the Deputy as well as with others to see how we can best make sure the sports investment we are putting in makes the biggest impact at local level. ",

        "answerText": " Deputy Matt Carthy  My question is more of an appeal to the Minister and the Minister of State to work with Monaghan County Council, the local community and all elected representatives to help ensure that we can deliver a swimming pool complex in the town of Carrickmacross. \n Deputy Charlie McConalogue  I thank Deputy Carthy. As he knows, capital support for new swimming pools and the refurbishment of existing pools continues to be provided by the Department through the large-scale sport infrastructure fund, LSSIF, which to date has allocated €28.9 million to nine swimming pools throughout the country. Investment in a swimming pool for Monaghan, as the Deputy knows, is a matter for the local authority in the first instance. Once the next round of the LSSIF opens, Monaghan County Council will be eligible to apply for funding.  Ireland’s first national swimming strategy, which was published in August 2024, sets out a vision to provide everyone in our country with an opportunity to swim. It includes an action plan containing more than 50 actions across five thematic strands, focusing on providing improved facilities, increasing access for people with disabilities and improving the culture of inclusion, better coaching supports, increasing safety awareness and providing a pathway that allows for the nurturing and development of potential high performers.  Responsibility for the delivery of the strategy’s action plan will be shared across Departments, State agencies and other key stakeholders, including local authorities. Sport Ireland has established an oversight group of key stakeholders to give leadership, policy direction, prioritisation and mobilisation of resources to support, monitor and measure the strategy’s implementation. My current focus is on ensuring project delivery under the first two rounds of the LSSIF, from 2019 and 2024. There have only ever been two rounds. I would expect, and it is our objective, that the period until the next round of the LSSIF will be shorter than the period between the previous two. There were five years between the previous two. There was a significant gap in funding infrastructure until that large-scale sport infrastructure fund was introduced. It will be subject to our capital allocations within the national development plan. Within a much shorter timeframe, we hope to be able to run a new round. Monaghan County Council should work to have its preparation in place in order to be able to apply whenever it opens. \n Deputy Matt Carthy  I thank the Minister of State for his response. I urge him to ensure that the new round of funding is opened as quickly as possible. There has long been a demand for a swimming pool among the people of Carrickmacross. When the previous local authority swimming pool programme was in place, there was a substantial fundraising drive in the town but it did not result in a swimming pool.  That was largely, to be quite frank about it, due to a bias within the county council executive at that time. Thankfully, we now have a situation where all partners are on board, including the council executive, the members of the local authorities and particularly the local community and sporting organisations. Thanks to the efforts of Councillor Colm Carthy and the wider areas, we recently had a pop-up pool in the town for a number of months. The period of time it is going to be there has been extended because the demand for it has been so great. There is clearly a huge surge in support for swimming activities. Carrickmacross needs this facility. Will the Minister of State be proactive in supporting towns like Carrickmacross to deliver these facilities? \n Deputy Charlie McConalogue  The first requirement is for the county council to be proactive. While I certainly will be proactive in trying to ensure we secure funding and deliver swimming pools throughout the country, we will only be able to deal with applications that are on our desk. It is highly likely we will not be able to deal with every application, given the level of demand, but we will be doing our best to see real development in this regard.  There is no doubt there are significant gaps in swimming pool infrastructure throughout the country. Swimming is the only national sport at the moment that has a dedicated national strategy, the national swimming strategy, which was published approximately one year ago. As part of that strategy, one of the action points was to develop a sense and audit of the swimming pool facilities across the country. Swim Ireland is undertaking that audit. It is assessing where swimming pool facilities and the most significant gaps are. That will inform how we step out to try to address that. We want to get to a situation where everyone has the opportunity to be able to access facilities and learn to swim. We want people to be able to participate in swimming throughout their life, both in Monaghan and throughout the country. \n Deputy Matt Carthy  I am pleased to report that Monaghan County Council is now being proactive. As I mentioned, the pop-up pool has been a huge success. A feasibility study has been conducted by the local authority, which shows and reinforces that the demand is there.  The reason there is a national strategy for swimming is that it is much more than a sport. In fact, people involved in every sport benefit from utilising swimming facilities. There is also a recognition that this is an amenity. Carrickmacross is a growing town that has faced challenges in recent years, not least due its growth but also because many of the town’s amenities have been delivered from within the community. We have not seen the type of Government investment that other towns the size of Carrickmacross have received. It would send a very powerful message if we were to deliver the sod-turning on a swimming pool complex in Carrickmacross within the lifetime of this Government. I again urge the Minister of State to work with Monaghan County Council. While it has a role it needs to play, I ask him to be proactive in opening a round of funding that Monaghan County Council can apply for to make this project happen. \n Deputy Charlie McConalogue  As the Deputy knows, we had a round recently in which almost 30 projects across the country were grant-aided under the large-scale support infrastructure fund, LSSIF. The focus on the short term is to work with all of those applications that were successful in the recent round, as well as with a good number from 2019, to ensure that they are progressing, that funding is getting drawn down and that we see those facilities built. Some swimming pools are a part of that.  We hope to have the next round in a shorter timeframe than the five-year gap between the last two rounds. It remains to be seen what that timeframe will be. I encourage Monaghan County Council to ensure it gets its preparations in place to be in a position to apply at that point. In the meantime, I will be working with Sport Ireland and Swim Ireland to get a full assessment as to where the gaps are across the country. We will then look at how to ensure we get as much funding as possible to develop swimming pools throughout the country and open up applications in order that Monaghan County Council and other councils will be able to apply for pools. We will look to see where we can plug gaps to ensure everyone gets the opportunity to swim, particularly young people. It is about them having that opportunity earlier in their lives to be able to learn to swim in order that they can continue to participate and avail of it throughout their lifespans. ",

        "answerText": " Deputy Peadar Tóibín  One of my biggest frustrations and that of Aontú, in this Dáil and the previous one, is the waste of taxpayers' money and the lack of proper investigations and accountability. The Galway 2020 situation is an example of that. The difficulty with regard to waste is that it often becomes a crisis for a couple of weeks until the media cycle moves on and people forget about it. In the context of Exchequer funding to Galway 2020 and the Government’s decision for that not to exceed 50%, the Comptroller and Auditor General stated that the decision was not adhered to and that funding went far beyond that. He also said the disclosure of information was not forthcoming. Has there been a proper investigation into what happened with Galway 2020? \n Deputy Patrick O'Donovan  Galway’s designation as European Capital of Culture 2020 provided an opportunity to promote the city’s culture nationally and internationally. The Government allocated €15 million in two stages, with €14 million allocated to deliver the cultural programme of Galway European Capital of Culture and €1 million allocated for its legacy programme.  The drawdown of €14 million allocated to deliver the cultural programme was completed in November 2020. In line with the programme delivery agreements with the Department, quarterly management and independent auditor reports were received from Galway 2020. The independent auditor confirmed that Galway 2020 followed best practice in transparency, accountability and secured value for money.  In line with the requirements of the European Parliament and Council, every capital of culture is required to have an external and independent evaluation of its programme. This found that Galway 2020 had fulfilled its ambition as set out in its bid book and achieved the general and specific objectives of a European Capital of Culture and the operational objectives relevant to individual European capitals of culture.  An analysis by the independent evaluator demonstrated that the €14 million investment helped provide employment to 894 artists and cultural workers. Cultural projects delivered more than 1,200 events to the public through a combination of physical and online delivery across all art forms, the majority of which were free.  The final payment of €1 million under the legacy programme was made to Galway Culture Company in July 2024. The agreement between the Department and Galway Culture Company required an external evaluation of the programme and an independent auditor’s review, as well as regular monitoring meetings. Key performance indicators and drawdown requirements were also set out for the programme. I recently received the final reporting on the legacy programme. I welcome the analysis by the independent evaluators, The Audience Agency, that Galway Culture Company delivered a successful programme using a budget of €1 million in an effective and efficient way, demonstrating transparency in the way this had been administered and meeting its obligations as stated in the performance delivery agreement with the Department.  I will give more information in my next response. \n Deputy Peadar Tóibín  I thank the Minister. The independent auditor and its outcomes are in direct contradiction to the Comptroller and Auditor General. The project had received more than €20 million in State funding by 2023. The Minister's Department provided approximately €15 million; Galway City Council provided €3.7 million; Galway County Council provided €2.6 million; and the EU provided €1.5 million. The outcome of that was a number of resignations. Several resignations happened and people took cases to the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC.  There is no doubt that Galway is a fantastic city and that much of the money did good work to support local artists. Bad luck with weather and Covid-19 played a role in what happened to Galway 2020. Nevertheless, many people are not satisfied with the value-for-money aspect of the programme and that the Comptroller and Auditor General's questions are still outstanding. Does the Minister not have a concern about that? \n Deputy Patrick O'Donovan  To finish my earlier response, the analysis of spending found that the €1 million budget had been allocated under the following strategic objectives: €191,920 to facilitate international and EU relationships and funding; €537,413 to support place-based cultural programming; and €270,668 in supports to the cultural and creative sector. Galway 2020 was delivered in the most efficient circumstances during the height of Covid-19. While this necessitated a complete re-engineering of the year, the Department is satisfied that its funding was applied appropriately.  The Deputy is right that there was an unfortunate sequence of events with weather, Covid-19 and everything else. I think the earlier part of my response, which outlined the independent evaluation and the audit trail in place for moneys expended by my Department, was clear. \n Deputy Peadar Tóibín  It would be unfortunate if we were to insulate the expenditure from the Minister's Department from all of the other expenditure that came from this. A representative of Aontú in the area, Luke Silke, has done significant work on this matter. A large amount of money was spent. Taxpayers have had to fork out for this, even in the years subsequent to 2020. People were still paying for this in 2023. As soon as the Minister started his job, he came across the crisis in the Arts Council with the IT system that never functioned. Privately, he probably shares the same concerns as me around value for money and the waste that is happening in these spaces.  My appeal to the Minister is for him to leave a legacy on this, so that there is full accountability for waste that happens. Full accountability means that there is a cost to the individuals who are not protecting the public purse. If we do not have this cost, we are cursed to wake up to see these same stories repeat themselves. \n Deputy Patrick O'Donovan  The Deputy is right in respect of what I did on assuming the office of Minister with responsibility for culture, communications and sport. I became aware of a substantial problem in the Department and a legacy problem in the Arts Council. I have dealt with this in a manner that I believe to be proportionate and responsible in the sense that I have asked Professor Niamh Brennan, in the first instance, to carry out a complete overhaul examination of the culture, organisation and corporate governance in the Arts Council. I have made the commitment that any recommendations from this will be implemented. I have also asked the IPA to look at my Department because I have said on the record in the Dáil that I am not satisfied with the manner in which the Department dealt with it. Regarding Galway 2020, I can only answer here for the Department. I cannot answer for Galway City Council or Galway County Council. I have previously expressed views regarding the role of the Comptroller and Auditor General in respect of local authorities. I believe that would be an appropriate way to leverage this. ",

        "answerText": " Deputy Pearse Doherty  I want to raise the issue of the criteria that were used for the grassroots music venue support scheme. I commend the Department on introducing this scheme. As a festival director, I am acutely aware of the challenges for major festivals, like our own, but also the grassroots music venue supports. The scheme was very welcome, but it is devastating to learn how the Department divvied out this money on a first-come first-served basis. Not one venue north of Galway or west of Louth got money, despite the fact that there are sound technicians, music technicians and artists playing in venues that were eligible. The whole region has been left out because of the criteria used by the Department. This needs to be examined quickly. Some of these venues need the support and I ask the Minister reconsider the decisions that have been made. \n Deputy Patrick O'Donovan  I propose to take Questions Nos. 139 and 149 together.  I launched the grassroots music venue support scheme in March this year to support small, established music venues that promote themselves and are known in the community for programming grassroots music artists, in recognition of the contribution they make to the music industry and the wider night-time economy.  The scheme aims to provide employment opportunities for emerging artists and professionals, including production staff and crew who are dependent on live performances. The scheme operated with a total fund of €500,000 and grants were available of up to €15,000 to host events showcasing the talent of emerging, grassroots artists, performing live music that they have written or created themselves. The scheme was extremely popular and it was closed in early April as it was oversubscribed. A total of 96 applications were received by my Department. Applications were assessed by my officials strictly by order of date and time of receipt and all venues had to meet the eligibility criteria and conditions of funding, in accordance with the guidelines of the scheme. Of the 96 applications received, a total of 45 were eligible for funding. I recently announced the names of 33 venues that were awarded funding under this scheme. Of the 45 venues eligible for funding, there was a broad geographical spread with more than 40% of the venues located outside of the major cities and more than 70% outside Dublin.  The majority of eligible applications were from Munster with a total of 19 venues eligible for funding; 13 applications were eligible for funding in Dublin; ten in Leinster; two in Connacht and one in Ulster. I acknowledge that the number of eligible applications for Ulster is low but we only received four applications for funding from that province and six in total for the north-west region. Unfortunately, we could not allocate funds to the remaining 12 eligible applicants, based on available funding resources. My officials have written to all successful applicants to ask if they will use their full allocation and should any funding become available, they will redistribute the funding to the next eligible applicant on the list. I understand that there may be disappointed applicants but, as I have stated, I recognise the value of this scheme to venues across Ireland and I am committed to considering another phase of this in the not too distant future. \n Deputy Pearse Doherty  I welcome the scheme and that money was provided. It was announced that the scheme was open and there was a closing date for it. The only venue in County Donegal that is eligible for the scheme is The Social in Gaoth Dobhair. I will give an example and the Minister will be aware of it because all the details were provided. The Social operated 84 eligible grassroots events during the two years that the scheme was available. This means that the venue was, on average, operating one of these events every week. This is a stand-alone facility; this is not a pub. It hosted ticketed events with artists such as The Hothouse Flowers, Muireann Bradley and others from across the island of Ireland. This supported sound engineers, lighting engineers and, most importantly, the acts themselves. To my knowledge, not one venue in the north west has been granted this money.  The Minister announced this scheme that went from €5,000 up to €15,000 and the Department decided that 12 eligible applicants would get no money whatsoever. It would have been fairer for the Department give every eligible applicant €11,000 or thereabouts. There was €500,000 available so each could have got €11,000. However, the Department decided to give the money on a first-come first-served basis, despite the fact that in the case of The Social, its application was in to the Department within a week. They were told that someone got in before them and that was it. That is completely unfair. Good luck to all the venues that got the support. I imagine that there are very few that were as active and had as many eligible events as The Social in Gaoth Dobhair. The Minister will have this data.  My question to the Minister chimes with what Jim McGuinness has been talking about regarding Donegal GAA for a while. Does the Minister not recognise that there are grassroots venues in the north west, that there are acts that need to be supported in these venues and that there are sound engineers and technicians who need to have a way of life as a result of that? The night-time economy initiative in Buncrana is completely different. No venue in Buncrana is eligible. No venue in counties Donegal, Sligo or Monaghan fit the criteria that have been set, bar The Social. \n Deputy Patrick O'Donovan  I have outlined the rationale for the distribution of funding under the scheme and I have said that I am committed to additional schemes of this nature in the future. It is remiss of the Deputy to try to run down the officials in the Department. Ultimately, this was a pilot scheme. We tried to give out the money as quickly as possible. I have outlined the number of people outside of Dublin who got it. No matter how the officials in the Department distributed this money, they were going to be wrong in somebody's eyes. They have done a very good job and I hope that there will be cross-party support for the continuation of the scheme in budget 2026. I hope we will have a bigger pool of money and that we will be able to address all of those who were disappointed. There are disappointed people in many other counties as well, which the Deputy did not reference.  I am glad the Deputy referred to the night-time economy officer. There are many towns in the country that are way smaller or way bigger than Buncrana that do not have one. The Deputy did not reference this in his retort. I am sure that the officer is working very closely with venues in Buncrana and I will be able to evaluate the work in the not too distant future.  Regarding this scheme, I intend to have a repeat of it as soon as possible. When I have the necessary resources, we will be able to evaluate the output that of the scheme. Hopefully, we will also be able to address some, but maybe not all, of the disappointment. \n Deputy Pearse Doherty  I am a Donegal TD. I will not stand here and say that the Department did a great job when it excluded the entire north west from this support scheme. The venue that I am talking about provides more grassroots events than many of the others that were eligible. I am sure that the Minister will be delighted when he goes back to Limerick. How many got the grant in his own county? Was it four or five? That is good for them. I support every single grassroots venue and every single festival. That is really important. However, in Donegal and the north west generally there is an industry that needs to be supported as well. The idea that the Department decided without telling the applicants that funding would be provided on a first-come first-served basis is simply wrong. I commend the Minister on being able to secure this as a pilot project. However, there was enough money in the pool, limited as it was, to ensure that every eligible venue got support. Why is that important? It is important because the acts, the sound engineers and the lighting engineers get the support. There are people in my county and the north west who need that support, just as much as they need it in Limerick, Cork and Dublin. The Department has made a major mistake in how this was allocated. It has completely ignored the north west. Because it is not a huge amount, I appeal to the Minister to provide funding to the other 12 eligible applicants. It would be about €150,000. The Minister should at least make an appeal to the Minister for public expenditure or to his own Department to make sure that every eligible applicant gets their fair share of this support. \n Deputy Patrick O'Donovan  I thank the Deputy for the single transferable speech. No matter what I did on this, the Deputy was going to be opposed to it any way. Let us call a spade a spade. There was one eligible application from Ulster. I have said and made it very clear that as soon as we get an opportunity to have a second scheme, I am sure the Deputy will have all the wisdom of Job in articulating what should be in that scheme. \n Deputy Pearse Doherty  A bit of regional balance and stop screwing the north west----- \n Deputy Patrick O'Donovan  You have had a good run now for your video. My priority was to get the maximum amount of money out to the maximum number of locations. Rather than run down the locations that got it----- \n Deputy Pearse Doherty  I did not run them down. \n Deputy Patrick O'Donovan  The Deputy's party should be supportive of the locations that got it, rather than running them down. \n Deputy Pearse Doherty  The Minister said there was good regional spread. On which map of Ireland does good regional spread mean no venue north of Galway and west of Louth? \n An Leas-Cheann Comhairle  Deputy Doherty, please resume your seat. \n Deputy Pearse Doherty  If the Minister thinks that is true, he is off his rocker. \n Deputy Patrick O'Donovan  How is Sinn Féin's infrastructure Minister doing? \n Deputy Pearse Doherty  That is not good regional spread. \n Deputy Patrick O'Donovan  Has Sinn Féin's infrastructure Minister heard of the north west and the hames they made of the A5? \n An Leas-Cheann Comhairle  Thanks very much, Minister. Will you make way for the Tánaiste? He has to come in. \n The Tánaiste  I do not want to interrupt. \n Deputy Richard O'Donoghue  Now for round two. ",

The scheme aims to provide employment opportunities for emerging artists and professionals, including production staff and crew who are dependent on live performances. The scheme operated with a total fund of €500,000 and grants were available of up to €15,000 to host events showcasing the talent of emerging, grassroots artists, performing live music that they have written or created themselves. The scheme was extremely popular and it was closed in early April as it was oversubscribed. A total of 96 applications were received by my Department. Applications were assessed by my officials strictly by order of date and time of receipt and all venues had to meet the eligibility criteria and conditions of funding, in accordance with the guidelines of the scheme. Of the 96 applications received, a total of 45 were eligible for funding. I recently announced the names of 33 venues that were awarded funding under this scheme. Of the 45 venues eligible for funding, there was a broad geographical spread with more than 40% of the venues located outside of the major cities and more than 70% outside Dublin.  The majority of eligible applications were from Munster with a total of 19 venues eligible for funding; 13 applications were eligible for funding in Dublin; ten in Leinster; two in Connacht and one in Ulster. I acknowledge that the number of eligible applications for Ulster is low but we only received four applications for funding from that province and six in total for the north-west region. Unfortunately, we could not allocate funds to the remaining 12 eligible applicants, based on available funding resources. My officials have written to all successful applicants to ask if they will use their full allocation and should any funding become available, they will redistribute the funding to the next eligible applicant on the list. I understand that there may be disappointed applicants but, as I have stated, I recognise the value of this scheme to venues across Ireland and I am committed to considering another phase of this in the not too distant future. \n Deputy Pearse Doherty  I welcome the scheme and that money was provided. It was announced that the scheme was open and there was a closing date for it. The only venue in County Donegal that is eligible for the scheme is The Social in Gaoth Dobhair. I will give an example and the Minister will be aware of it because all the details were provided. The Social operated 84 eligible grassroots events during the two years that the scheme was available. This means that the venue was, on average, operating one of these events every week. This is a stand-alone facility; this is not a pub. It hosted ticketed events with artists such as The Hothouse Flowers, Muireann Bradley and others from across the island of Ireland. This supported sound engineers, lighting engineers and, most importantly, the acts themselves. To my knowledge, not one venue in the north west has been granted this money.  The Minister announced this scheme that went from €5,000 up to €15,000 and the Department decided that 12 eligible applicants would get no money whatsoever. It would have been fairer for the Department give every eligible applicant €11,000 or thereabouts. There was €500,000 available so each could have got €11,000. However, the Department decided to give the money on a first-come first-served basis, despite the fact that in the case of The Social, its application was in to the Department within a week. They were told that someone got in before them and that was it. That is completely unfair. Good luck to all the venues that got the support. I imagine that there are very few that were as active and had as many eligible events as The Social in Gaoth Dobhair. The Minister will have this data.  My question to the Minister chimes with what Jim McGuinness has been talking about regarding Donegal GAA for a while. Does the Minister not recognise that there are grassroots venues in the north west, that there are acts that need to be supported in these venues and that there are sound engineers and technicians who need to have a way of life as a result of that? The night-time economy initiative in Buncrana is completely different. No venue in Buncrana is eligible. No venue in counties Donegal, Sligo or Monaghan fit the criteria that have been set, bar The Social. \n Deputy Patrick O'Donovan  I have outlined the rationale for the distribution of funding under the scheme and I have said that I am committed to additional schemes of this nature in the future. It is remiss of the Deputy to try to run down the officials in the Department. Ultimately, this was a pilot scheme. We tried to give out the money as quickly as possible. I have outlined the number of people outside of Dublin who got it. No matter how the officials in the Department distributed this money, they were going to be wrong in somebody's eyes. They have done a very good job and I hope that there will be cross-party support for the continuation of the scheme in budget 2026. I hope we will have a bigger pool of money and that we will be able to address all of those who were disappointed. There are disappointed people in many other counties as well, which the Deputy did not reference.  I am glad the Deputy referred to the night-time economy officer. There are many towns in the country that are way smaller or way bigger than Buncrana that do not have one. The Deputy did not reference this in his retort. I am sure that the officer is working very closely with venues in Buncrana and I will be able to evaluate the work in the not too distant future.  Regarding this scheme, I intend to have a repeat of it as soon as possible. When I have the necessary resources, we will be able to evaluate the output that of the scheme. Hopefully, we will also be able to address some, but maybe not all, of the disappointment. \n Deputy Pearse Doherty  I am a Donegal TD. I will not stand here and say that the Department did a great job when it excluded the entire north west from this support scheme. The venue that I am talking about provides more grassroots events than many of the others that were eligible. I am sure that the Minister will be delighted when he goes back to Limerick. How many got the grant in his own county? Was it four or five? That is good for them. I support every single grassroots venue and every single festival. That is really important. However, in Donegal and the north west generally there is an industry that needs to be supported as well. The idea that the Department decided without telling the applicants that funding would be provided on a first-come first-served basis is simply wrong. I commend the Minister on being able to secure this as a pilot project. However, there was enough money in the pool, limited as it was, to ensure that every eligible venue got support. Why is that important? It is important because the acts, the sound engineers and the lighting engineers get the support. There are people in my county and the north west who need that support, just as much as they need it in Limerick, Cork and Dublin. The Department has made a major mistake in how this was allocated. It has completely ignored the north west. Because it is not a huge amount, I appeal to the Minister to provide funding to the other 12 eligible applicants. It would be about €150,000. The Minister should at least make an appeal to the Minister for public expenditure or to his own Department to make sure that every eligible applicant gets their fair share of this support. \n Deputy Patrick O'Donovan  I thank the Deputy for the single transferable speech. No matter what I did on this, the Deputy was going to be opposed to it any way. Let us call a spade a spade. There was one eligible application from Ulster. I have said and made it very clear that as soon as we get an opportunity to have a second scheme, I am sure the Deputy will have all the wisdom of Job in articulating what should be in that scheme. \n Deputy Pearse Doherty  A bit of regional balance and stop screwing the north west----- \n Deputy Patrick O'Donovan  You have had a good run now for your video. My priority was to get the maximum amount of money out to the maximum number of locations. Rather than run down the locations that got it----- \n Deputy Pearse Doherty  I did not run them down. \n Deputy Patrick O'Donovan  The Deputy's party should be supportive of the locations that got it, rather than running them down. \n Deputy Pearse Doherty  The Minister said there was good regional spread. On which map of Ireland does good regional spread mean no venue north of Galway and west of Louth? \n An Leas-Cheann Comhairle  Deputy Doherty, please resume your seat. \n Deputy Pearse Doherty  If the Minister thinks that is true, he is off his rocker. \n Deputy Patrick O'Donovan  How is Sinn Féin's infrastructure Minister doing? \n Deputy Pearse Doherty  That is not good regional spread. \n Deputy Patrick O'Donovan  Has Sinn Féin's infrastructure Minister heard of the north west and the hames they made of the A5? \n An Leas-Cheann Comhairle  Thanks very much, Minister. Will you make way for the Tánaiste? He has to come in. \n The Tánaiste  I do not want to interrupt. \n Deputy Richard O'Donoghue  Now for round two.",
        "formatted_question": "What is the total number of eligible applicants for the grassroots music venue supports scheme, the number of successful applicants, and will the Minister provide a statement on this matter?",
        "formatted_answer": "The grassroots music venue support scheme, launched in March with a total fund of €500,000, provided grants of up to €15,000. A total of 96 applications were received, with 45 meeting the eligibility criteria. Of these, 33 were successful. Funding was distributed on a first-come, first-served basis. The geographic distribution showed more than 40% of eligible venues outside major cities and over 70% outside Dublin. Regionally, Munster had 19 eligible venues, Dublin 13, Leinster 10, Connacht 2, and Ulster 1. Due to limited funds, 12 eligible applicants did not receive funding. Officials have contacted successful applicants about using their full allocation and redistributing any unused funds. The Minister plans to consider another phase of the scheme in the future."

        "answerText": " Deputy Naoise Ó Cearúil  The basic income for the arts pilot scheme has already shown a transformative impact. Artists report producing more work, enjoying better well-being and feeling more financially secure. It has been extended for six months to allow for a full evaluation. I ask the Minister outline to his plans for a successor scheme and to confirm that budget 2026 will include ring-fenced funding for its continuation. \n Deputy Patrick O'Donovan  I propose to take Questions Nos. 134, 138 and 141 together. As the Deputies will be aware, the programme for Government commits to assessing the basic income for the arts pilot research scheme to maximise its impact. The scheme has now been operating for almost three years and is underpinned by a robust research programme collecting data about all aspects of the lives of the artists and creative arts workers who are participating in the scheme.  There is clearly broad support for the scheme, as is evident from the numerous representations from colleagues to me on behalf of their constituents. Last week, I announced that Cabinet agreed to my proposal to an extension of six months, to February 2026, to allow for further evaluation of the pilot data, which will provide the evidence base for Government to make decisions on the next steps. This will also give sufficient time to engage in stakeholder consultation.  I am aware there is broad-based support for the scheme across the sector, and I have met the National Campaign for the Arts to discuss this. I intend to bring proposals for a permanent intervention to Cabinet as part of budget 2026, using the evidence arising from the research programme and stakeholder engagement. The programme for Government and the Government’s research and innovation strategy note the importance of incorporating the use of evidence into the policy development process and of improving links between policymakers and researchers. This is a key programme to bring research and data to provide an evidence base for Government to make decisions on future policy for the arts.  The rate being paid to recipients is €325 per week and this allows for 2,000 people to receive the payment within the current pilot scheme, which costs €35 million per year for 2,000 recipients. The current scheme costs €105 million for its three-year duration. The full cost of the six-month extension is €16.7 million. The net overall cost of the pilot is likely to be less, given the number of recipients who were previously on social welfare supports prior to entering the scheme.  The scheme's research pilot is designed as a randomised control trial in order to make it possible to identify causality and has benefited from the involvement of external researchers. This randomised control trial includes a treatment group of 2,000, that is, recipients of the payment, and a control group of 1,000 who are not in receipt of the payment. The control group provides the same survey data as those in receipt of the payment and, although that cohort does not get the payment, individuals are paid €650 per year to participate. The differences in outcomes for the treatment group and control group illustrates the impact of the basic income for the arts payment to those in receipt of it. The control group data shows that they suffer more from the precarious and inconsistent nature of their income. It is important to note that even those in receipt of the payment fare worse than the general population in terms of deprivation and depression.  This is the first large-scale randomised control test undertaken by a Department and represents one of the leading impact evaluations under way in the public sector. Evaluation of the pilot is and has been continuous, with participants completing a detailed survey every six months. The Department has undertaken a broad research programme, including two papers based on the baseline survey, that is, information about participants' lives before they received the first BIA payment and two impact assessments that have been published to date.  The Department is preparing a report examining the first 24 months of the scheme, which is due to be published over the summer months. An interview research paper written by an independent researcher was also published recently. This paper collects the experiences of 50 recipients, who have been interviewed by a sociologist.  While the research phase of the scheme is still ongoing, it is clear from the evidence collected to date by the Department on the scheme that it is having a positive impact on participants. This data shows that the BIA payment is having a consistent, positive impact across almost all indicators, affecting practice development, sectoral retention, well-being and deprivation.  In terms of ongoing evaluation of the scheme, work has recently begun with an external independent economic consultancy to prepare a full cost-benefit analysis of the BIA. The aim of a cost-benefit analysis is to compare the benefits and costs arising from a specific policy, in order to determine its net value. Therefore, the costs and benefits arising from the BIA will be measured and compared to determine its effectiveness prior to any decision on a successor programme. In addition to the cost-benefit analysis, the contractors will map available funding opportunities for artists in Ireland and examine how the BIA functions within the broader art ecosystem, to understand if it is a more or less efficient policy than similar supports.  As I mentioned, I also recently published a qualitative research paper, based on interviews with recipients of the BIA. This provides the lived experience of some of those in receipt of the BIA. This report found that the stability of the payment has significantly reduced underlying financial stress, to provide relief and peace of mind that allows recipients to experience a reduced sense of anxiety about meeting their basic needs.  As part of the policy development process, the Department established an interagency consultative committee on the basic income for the arts research scheme. This committee is an opportunity for the research outputs to be shared across relevant Departments and agencies and allows for discussion of the research findings. I know that the BIA support is hugely valued by artists in receipt of it. It has also been the subject of much positive commentary at home and abroad, and makes an important statement about how Ireland values the arts.  A Government decision will be required on any successor scheme to the pilot, and the future of the BIA will be decided when the results of the research are available, something which is facilitated by the extension I have announced. I plan to engage with stakeholders over the coming months to determine what adjustments could be made to the scheme and how the eligibility and other criteria might be refined. I look forward to bringing forward the proposals I have at that stage to my Cabinet colleagues as part of budget 2026. \n Deputy Naoise Ó Cearúil  I thank the Minister for the reply and for the work he continues to do on the basic income for the arts pilot. The scheme has made a real difference to the lives of close to 2,000 artists. We know that the evidence the Minister has mentioned points to positive outcomes across practice development, sectoral resilience and community engagement. Given the Department is preparing the full report and a cost-benefit analysis, will these findings be published in full? I appreciate the Minister will bring them to Cabinet, which will be able to make a decision thereafter, but it would be great if the findings were published and we could see the evidence. Does the Minister accept it is more than just an income support for artists? It is a statement about the value we place on culture and creativity in Irish society. A successor scheme or a continuation must be co-designed with artists, including those with disabilities and from minority backgrounds, to ensure it is inclusive and accessible from the start. \n Deputy Peadar Tóibín  Aontú has supported the scheme from the outset. The reason we have done so is that, unfortunately, poverty and the arts are often synonymous. People who work in the arts probably have the most precarious work that exists in the country. Their lived experience is often the direct opposite of people's understanding of the glamour of the arts. The difficulty I have with this is that we have a project that has been going on for three years and we still do not have a decision on it from the Government. Absolutely we need time to evaluate and to make a decision but I have been long enough around here to have noticed that difficult decisions are often kicked down the road. I have a worry that only one quarter of the people who need this particular payment are in receipt of it. Now we will see another nine months pass without a decision being made on their experience. Theirs is probably the only sector of society which should get an income but whose income is decided on a random basis. It would be great to crystallise the decision as soon as possible. \n Deputy Patrick O'Donovan  I thank both Deputies for their support. To reply to Deputy Tóibín, this is not a difficult decision that has been kicked down the road. The scheme was due to end in August and the easy thing to do would have been to wind it up but I did not do that. I have extended it past the budgetary date at the end of the year and into the new year. This will give me an opportunity to use empirical quantitative and qualitative data to demonstrate to the public and to colleagues in the Government that this is a scheme worth retaining. As with any pilot scheme, such as with regard to grassroots music venues, with a pilot there is always a confined number of people at the start. Invariably there will be people who are disappointed. This is the nature of pilot schemes. I welcome the fact that Deputy Tóibín's party supports it.  Deputy Ó Cearúil is right that the concept of this when my predecessor introduced it was to give people the opportunity to practise while, at the same time, taking them out of a poverty trap. The cost-benefit analysis will give us an opportunity to see what has been defrayed by way of social protection payments and what has been offered by way of this payment. We will then have a more holistic view of the outputs regarding what the State has gleaned and gained from making the investment, how the artists themselves have gained, how the community has gained and what the costs are. The costs can be borne and weighed in terms of savings made from the non-payment of social protection as against, on the other side, the assignment of moneys under the basic income for the arts. There is a bit of work to be done on this yet but the community has responded very positively to my position on this, which is that I want it retained. I do not think this is kicking the can down the road. It is making sure before I bring a proposal to the Government that we have all our ducks in a row. \n Deputy Naoise Ó Cearúil  Other countries such as Finland and Germany have introduced similar schemes as part of long-term cultural and economic planning. Has the Department engaged with these international examples or does it plan to do so? Something I am very conscious of, and I know the Minister is also, is ensuring there is no cliff edge for participants when the pilot ends. Many of these artists will have structured their lives and livelihoods around the scheme. We have to allow them a level of certainty and make sure they understand whether there will be a continuation or an end to it at any stage so they are prepared for it. What we need is a permanent inclusive scheme with certainty, as I have said. I appreciate the level of research the Minister needs to do before continuing it. I also appreciate that the pilot scheme will continue until February 2026. \n Deputy Patrick O'Donovan  I thank Deputy Ó Cearúil. At a recent meeting of culture ministers in Brussels, a number of colleagues from other member states spoke to me about this and they could not believe, to be quite honest about it, that we had introduced a scheme of this nature. They were envious, to put it mildly, that we have a scheme of this nature and that we have the resources and capacity, based on the economy and the way we have managed the country's financial resources, to introduce this, albeit on a pilot basis.  Deputy Ó Cearúíl is right with regard to a cliff edge. This is why I did what I did last week. I had to make sure we removed the cliff edge. Had I not done anything, and had I just wound it up and brought the data to the Government after the fact, then everybody would be out in August. I did not think that was the most appropriate way to deal with it. I have given certainty to the first 2,000 people. Ultimately this will be a decision for the Government. It will be a resource-based decision. There are competing demands in the Department and between Departments. Everybody who comes in here to ask oral questions will ask about agriculture, roads, schools or doctors. This is a competing demand. I welcome the fact that Deputies from all parties and none are supportive of it. Any support that can be articulated to my colleagues in the Department of Finance and the Department of public expenditure and reform would be very welcome. ",

To reply to Deputy Tóibín, this is not a difficult decision that has been kicked down the road. The scheme was due to end in August and the easy thing to do would have been to wind it up but I did not do that. I have extended it past the budgetary date at the end of the year and into the new year. This will give me an opportunity to use empirical quantitative and qualitative data to demonstrate to the public and to colleagues in the Government that this is a scheme worth retaining. As with any pilot scheme, such as with regard to grassroots music venues, with a pilot there is always a confined number of people at the start. Invariably there will be people who are disappointed. This is the nature of pilot schemes. I welcome the fact that Deputy Tóibín's party supports it.  Deputy Ó Cearúil is right that the concept of this when my predecessor introduced it was to give people the opportunity to practise while, at the same time, taking them out of a poverty trap. The cost-benefit analysis will give us an opportunity to see what has been defrayed by way of social protection payments and what has been offered by way of this payment. We will then have a more holistic view of the outputs regarding what the State has gleaned and gained from making the investment, how the artists themselves have gained, how the community has gained and what the costs are. The costs can be borne and weighed in terms of savings made from the non-payment of social protection as against, on the other side, the assignment of moneys under the basic income for the arts. There is a bit of work to be done on this yet but the community has responded very positively to my position on this, which is that I want it retained. I do not think this is kicking the can down the road. It is making sure before I bring a proposal to the Government that we have all our ducks in a row. \n Deputy Naoise Ó Cearúil  Other countries such as Finland and Germany have introduced similar schemes as part of long-term cultural and economic planning. Has the Department engaged with these international examples or does it plan to do so? Something I am very conscious of, and I know the Minister is also, is ensuring there is no cliff edge for participants when the pilot ends. Many of these artists will have structured their lives and livelihoods around the scheme. We have to allow them a level of certainty and make sure they understand whether there will be a continuation or an end to it at any stage so they are prepared for it. What we need is a permanent inclusive scheme with certainty, as I have said. I appreciate the level of research the Minister needs to do before continuing it. I also appreciate that the pilot scheme will continue until February 2026. \n Deputy Patrick O'Donovan  I thank Deputy Ó Cearúil. At a recent meeting of culture ministers in Brussels, a number of colleagues from other member states spoke to me about this and they could not believe, to be quite honest about it, that we had introduced a scheme of this nature. They were envious, to put it mildly, that we have a scheme of this nature and that we have the resources and capacity, based on the economy and the way we have managed the country's financial resources, to introduce this, albeit on a pilot basis.  Deputy Ó Cearúíl is right with regard to a cliff edge. This is why I did what I did last week. I had to make sure we removed the cliff edge. Had I not done anything, and had I just wound it up and brought the data to the Government after the fact, then everybody would be out in August. I did not think that was the most appropriate way to deal with it. I have given certainty to the first 2,000 people. Ultimately this will be a decision for the Government. It will be a resource-based decision. There are competing demands in the Department and between Departments. Everybody who comes in here to ask oral questions will ask about agriculture, roads, schools or doctors. This is a competing demand. I welcome the fact that Deputies from all parties and none are supportive of it. Any support that can be articulated to my colleagues in the Department of Finance and the Department of public expenditure and reform would be very welcome.",
        "formatted_question": "Has the Department analyzed the effectiveness of the basic income for the arts scheme?",
        "formatted_answer": "The basic income for the arts pilot scheme has been extended for six months until February 2026. It has been operational for nearly three years, supported by a robust research program that collects data on participants' lives. The scheme involves a randomized control trial with 2,000 recipients receiving €325 weekly and 1,000 control group participants who receive €650 annually for their involvement. The annual cost is €35 million, totaling €105 million over three years, with the extension costing €16.7 million. \n\nEvaluation includes continuous monitoring through six-monthly surveys, two baseline papers, and an interview study with 50 recipients. A report on the first 24 months is expected by summer. An independent cost-benefit analysis is underway to assess the scheme's benefits against its costs. The analysis will also compare the scheme with other funding opportunities for artists. \n\nThe scheme's impact is positive across practice development, well-being, and deprivation. The Department has engaged with international examples of similar schemes in countries like Finland and Germany. A successor scheme decision will follow the completion of research, likely in Budget 2026. The extension aims to avoid a sudden end to payments, addressing concerns about financial stability for participants."

        "answerText": " Minister for Culture, Communications and Sport  In support of Action 19 in the Report of the Night-Time Economy Taskforce and as part of the Department's key role in driving the Night-Time Economy in Ireland, we are funding 9 NTE Advisors in Dublin City, Cork City, Limerick City, Galway City, Kilkenny, Sligo, Longford, Buncrana and Drogheda.  The Night-Time Economy pilots are a significant project within the Night-Time Economy policy area and arguably one of the most impactful. This year I have allocated just under €1.4 million in funding to support these pilots to cover: salary costs; a funding package to roll out their plans, including support for Culture Night Late and Cruinniú Late.  The Advisors are helping to drive and support a more sustainable Night-Time Economy in their local areas. The Department engages with them regularly and supports their development. They also work collaboratively on larger projects which have included a late night transport campaign in partnership with the National Transport Authority, and a late night safety campaign. Each is responsible for developing specific action plans for their own areas. The Department has detailed Service Level Agreements with each Local Authority setting out key objectives and deliverables.  Following a competitive tendering process in 2024, Communiqué International were appointed to conduct a review of the 9 Night-Time Economy pilots, to look critically at the structures involved in supporting the Advisors, the visibility and impact of each in their respective areas, the future roll-out of the pilots and whether a further roll-out is warranted and what needs to be put in place to make this model effective.

        "extracted_answer": "Minister for Culture, Communications and Sport  In support of Action 19 in the Report of the Night-Time Economy Taskforce and as part of the Department's key role in driving the Night-Time Economy in Ireland, we are funding 9 NTE Advisors in Dublin City, Cork City, Limerick City, Galway City, Kilkenny, Sligo, Longford, Buncrana and Drogheda.  The Night-Time Economy pilots are a significant project within the Night-Time Economy policy area and arguably one of the most impactful. This year I have allocated just under €1.4 million in funding to support these pilots to cover: salary costs; a funding package to roll out their plans, including support for Culture Night Late and Cruinniú Late.  The Advisors are helping to drive and support a more sustainable Night-Time Economy in their local areas. The Department engages with them regularly and supports their development. They also work collaboratively on larger projects which have included a late night transport campaign in partnership with the National Transport Authority, and a late night safety campaign. Each is responsible for developing specific action plans for their own areas. The Department has detailed Service Level Agreements with each Local Authority setting out key objectives and deliverables.  Following a competitive tendering process in 2024, Communiqué International were appointed to conduct a review of the 9 Night-Time Economy pilots, to look critically at the structures involved in supporting the Advisors, the visibility and impact of each in their respective areas, the future roll-out of the pilots and whether a further roll-out is warranted and what needs to be put in place to make this model effective.  I understand that the review of the pilots has now concluded and the subsequent Report is due to be finalised very shortly.

The LSSIF was established under the National Sports Policy, published on 25 July 2018, to provide Exchequer support for larger sports facility projects, typically those requiring investments greater than the maximum available under the CSFF. The aim of the fund is to provide investment in sporting infrastructure that will reinforce the Department’s stated sporting objectives such as increasing active participation in sport, including female participation and participation by those with a disability as well as increasing social participation and improving high performance in sport.  Over a quarter of a billion euro was allocated to 3,048 community sports clubs and facilities in 2024 from the 2023 round of the CSFF, representing the largest-ever investment in sports facilities in communities across Ireland. The total investment over the first two LSSIF rounds (2019 and 2024) stands at €297 million, with funding allocations provided to 68 large-scale projects.  Since 2015, almost €17 million was allocated to over 300 sporting projects in Wicklow through the CSFF. In addition, a total of €2.23 million in LSSIF funding has been awarded to Wicklow-based projects. Of this, €1.79 million was allocated to Wicklow Swimming Pool and Leisure Centre to upgrade to the swimming pool facilities and this project is yet to commence. €436,032 was allocated to Charlesland Athletics Track for replacement of the athletics track and this work is now complete.

        "answerText": " Deputy Pearse Doherty  I want to raise the issue of the criteria that were used for the grassroots music venue support scheme. I commend the Department on introducing this scheme. As a festival director, I am acutely aware of the challenges for major festivals, like our own, but also the grassroots music venue supports. The scheme was very welcome, but it is devastating to learn how the Department divvied out this money on a first-come first-served basis. Not one venue north of Galway or west of Louth got money, despite the fact that there are sound technicians, music technicians and artists playing in venues that were eligible. The whole region has been left out because of the criteria used by the Department. This needs to be examined quickly. Some of these venues need the support and I ask the Minister reconsider the decisions that have been made. \n Deputy Patrick O'Donovan  I propose to take Questions Nos. 139 and 149 together.  I launched the grassroots music venue support scheme in March this year to support small, established music venues that promote themselves and are known in the community for programming grassroots music artists, in recognition of the contribution they make to the music industry and the wider night-time economy.  The scheme aims to provide employment opportunities for emerging artists and professionals, including production staff and crew who are dependent on live performances. The scheme operated with a total fund of €500,000 and grants were available of up to €15,000 to host events showcasing the talent of emerging, grassroots artists, performing live music that they have written or created themselves. The scheme was extremely popular and it was closed in early April as it was oversubscribed. A total of 96 applications were received by my Department. Applications were assessed by my officials strictly by order of date and time of receipt and all venues had to meet the eligibility criteria and conditions of funding, in accordance with the guidelines of the scheme. Of the 96 applications received, a total of 45 were eligible for funding. I recently announced the names of 33 venues that were awarded funding under this scheme. Of the 45 venues eligible for funding, there was a broad geographical spread with more than 40% of the venues located outside of the major cities and more than 70% outside Dublin.  The majority of eligible applications were from Munster with a total of 19 venues eligible for funding; 13 applications were eligible for funding in Dublin; ten in Leinster; two in Connacht and one in Ulster. I acknowledge that the number of eligible applications for Ulster is low but we only received four applications for funding from that province and six in total for the north-west region. Unfortunately, we could not allocate funds to the remaining 12 eligible applicants, based on available funding resources. My officials have written to all successful applicants to ask if they will use their full allocation and should any funding become available, they will redistribute the funding to the next eligible applicant on the list. I understand that there may be disappointed applicants but, as I have stated, I recognise the value of this scheme to venues across Ireland and I am committed to considering another phase of this in the not too distant future. \n Deputy Pearse Doherty  I welcome the scheme and that money was provided. It was announced that the scheme was open and there was a closing date for it. The only venue in County Donegal that is eligible for the scheme is The Social in Gaoth Dobhair. I will give an example and the Minister will be aware of it because all the details were provided. The Social operated 84 eligible grassroots events during the two years that the scheme was available. This means that the venue was, on average, operating one of these events every week. This is a stand-alone facility; this is not a pub. It hosted ticketed events with artists such as The Hothouse Flowers, Muireann Bradley and others from across the island of Ireland. This supported sound engineers, lighting engineers and, most importantly, the acts themselves. To my knowledge, not one venue in the north west has been granted this money.  The Minister announced this scheme that went from €5,000 up to €15,000 and the Department decided that 12 eligible applicants would get no money whatsoever. It would have been fairer for the Department give every eligible applicant €11,000 or thereabouts. There was €500,000 available so each could have got €11,000. However, the Department decided to give the money on a first-come first-served basis, despite the fact that in the case of The Social, its application was in to the Department within a week. They were told that someone got in before them and that was it. That is completely unfair. Good luck to all the venues that got the support. I imagine that there are very few that were as active and had as many eligible events as The Social in Gaoth Dobhair. The Minister will have this data.  My question to the Minister chimes with what Jim McGuinness has been talking about regarding Donegal GAA for a while. Does the Minister not recognise that there are grassroots venues in the north west, that there are acts that need to be supported in these venues and that there are sound engineers and technicians who need to have a way of life as a result of that? The night-time economy initiative in Buncrana is completely different. No venue in Buncrana is eligible. No venue in counties Donegal, Sligo or Monaghan fit the criteria that have been set, bar The Social. \n Deputy Patrick O'Donovan  I have outlined the rationale for the distribution of funding under the scheme and I have said that I am committed to additional schemes of this nature in the future. It is remiss of the Deputy to try to run down the officials in the Department. Ultimately, this was a pilot scheme. We tried to give out the money as quickly as possible. I have outlined the number of people outside of Dublin who got it. No matter how the officials in the Department distributed this money, they were going to be wrong in somebody's eyes. They have done a very good job and I hope that there will be cross-party support for the continuation of the scheme in budget 2026. I hope we will have a bigger pool of money and that we will be able to address all of those who were disappointed. There are disappointed people in many other counties as well, which the Deputy did not reference.  I am glad the Deputy referred to the night-time economy officer. There are many towns in the country that are way smaller or way bigger than Buncrana that do not have one. The Deputy did not reference this in his retort. I am sure that the officer is working very closely with venues in Buncrana and I will be able to evaluate the work in the not too distant future.  Regarding this scheme, I intend to have a repeat of it as soon as possible. When I have the necessary resources, we will be able to evaluate the output that of the scheme. Hopefully, we will also be able to address some, but maybe not all, of the disappointment. \n Deputy Pearse Doherty  I am a Donegal TD. I will not stand here and say that the Department did a great job when it excluded the entire north west from this support scheme. The venue that I am talking about provides more grassroots events than many of the others that were eligible. I am sure that the Minister will be delighted when he goes back to Limerick. How many got the grant in his own county? Was it four or five? That is good for them. I support every single grassroots venue and every single festival. That is really important. However, in Donegal and the north west generally there is an industry that needs to be supported as well. The idea that the Department decided without telling the applicants that funding would be provided on a first-come first-served basis is simply wrong. I commend the Minister on being able to secure this as a pilot project. However, there was enough money in the pool, limited as it was, to ensure that every eligible venue got support. Why is that important? It is important because the acts, the sound engineers and the lighting engineers get the support. There are people in my county and the north west who need that support, just as much as they need it in Limerick, Cork and Dublin. The Department has made a major mistake in how this was allocated. It has completely ignored the north west. Because it is not a huge amount, I appeal to the Minister to provide funding to the other 12 eligible applicants. It would be about €150,000. The Minister should at least make an appeal to the Minister for public expenditure or to his own Department to make sure that every eligible applicant gets their fair share of this support. \n Deputy Patrick O'Donovan  I thank the Deputy for the single transferable speech. No matter what I did on this, the Deputy was going to be opposed to it any way. Let us call a spade a spade. There was one eligible application from Ulster. I have said and made it very clear that as soon as we get an opportunity to have a second scheme, I am sure the Deputy will have all the wisdom of Job in articulating what should be in that scheme. \n Deputy Pearse Doherty  A bit of regional balance and stop screwing the north west----- \n Deputy Patrick O'Donovan  You have had a good run now for your video. My priority was to get the maximum amount of money out to the maximum number of locations. Rather than run down the locations that got it----- \n Deputy Pearse Doherty  I did not run them down. \n Deputy Patrick O'Donovan  The Deputy's party should be supportive of the locations that got it, rather than running them down. \n Deputy Pearse Doherty  The Minister said there was good regional spread. On which map of Ireland does good regional spread mean no venue north of Galway and west of Louth? \n An Leas-Cheann Comhairle  Deputy Doherty, please resume your seat. \n Deputy Pearse Doherty  If the Minister thinks that is true, he is off his rocker. \n Deputy Patrick O'Donovan  How is Sinn Féin's infrastructure Minister doing? \n Deputy Pearse Doherty  That is not good regional spread. \n Deputy Patrick O'Donovan  Has Sinn Féin's infrastructure Minister heard of the north west and the hames they made of the A5? \n An Leas-Cheann Comhairle  Thanks very much, Minister. Will you make way for the Tánaiste? He has to come in. \n The Tánaiste  I do not want to interrupt. \n Deputy Richard O'Donoghue  Now for round two. ",

There are many towns in the country that are way smaller or way bigger than Buncrana that do not have one. The Deputy did not reference this in his retort. I am sure that the officer is working very closely with venues in Buncrana and I will be able to evaluate the work in the not too distant future.  Regarding this scheme, I intend to have a repeat of it as soon as possible. When I have the necessary resources, we will be able to evaluate the output that of the scheme. Hopefully, we will also be able to address some, but maybe not all, of the disappointment. \n Deputy Pearse Doherty  I am a Donegal TD. I will not stand here and say that the Department did a great job when it excluded the entire north west from this support scheme. The venue that I am talking about provides more grassroots events than many of the others that were eligible. I am sure that the Minister will be delighted when he goes back to Limerick. How many got the grant in his own county? Was it four or five? That is good for them. I support every single grassroots venue and every single festival. That is really important. However, in Donegal and the north west generally there is an industry that needs to be supported as well. The idea that the Department decided without telling the applicants that funding would be provided on a first-come first-served basis is simply wrong. I commend the Minister on being able to secure this as a pilot project. However, there was enough money in the pool, limited as it was, to ensure that every eligible venue got support. Why is that important? It is important because the acts, the sound engineers and the lighting engineers get the support. There are people in my county and the north west who need that support, just as much as they need it in Limerick, Cork and Dublin. The Department has made a major mistake in how this was allocated. It has completely ignored the north west. Because it is not a huge amount, I appeal to the Minister to provide funding to the other 12 eligible applicants. It would be about €150,000. The Minister should at least make an appeal to the Minister for public expenditure or to his own Department to make sure that every eligible applicant gets their fair share of this support. \n Deputy Patrick O'Donovan  I thank the Deputy for the single transferable speech. No matter what I did on this, the Deputy was going to be opposed to it any way. Let us call a spade a spade. There was one eligible application from Ulster. I have said and made it very clear that as soon as we get an opportunity to have a second scheme, I am sure the Deputy will have all the wisdom of Job in articulating what should be in that scheme. \n Deputy Pearse Doherty  A bit of regional balance and stop screwing the north west----- \n Deputy Patrick O'Donovan  You have had a good run now for your video. My priority was to get the maximum amount of money out to the maximum number of locations. Rather than run down the locations that got it----- \n Deputy Pearse Doherty  I did not run them down. \n Deputy Patrick O'Donovan  The Deputy's party should be supportive of the locations that got it, rather than running them down. \n Deputy Pearse Doherty  The Minister said there was good regional spread. On which map of Ireland does good regional spread mean no venue north of Galway and west of Louth? \n An Leas-Cheann Comhairle  Deputy Doherty, please resume your seat. \n Deputy Pearse Doherty  If the Minister thinks that is true, he is off his rocker. \n Deputy Patrick O'Donovan  How is Sinn Féin's infrastructure Minister doing? \n Deputy Pearse Doherty  That is not good regional spread. \n Deputy Patrick O'Donovan  Has Sinn Féin's infrastructure Minister heard of the north west and the hames they made of the A5? \n An Leas-Cheann Comhairle  Thanks very much, Minister. Will you make way for the Tánaiste? He has to come in. \n The Tánaiste  I do not want to interrupt. \n Deputy Richard O'Donoghue  Now for round two.",
        "formatted_question": "What is the total number of eligible applicants for the grassroots music venue support scheme? How are the successful applicants geographically distributed? Will the Minister provide a statement on this matter?",
        "formatted_answer": "The grassroots music venue support scheme, launched with a €500,000 fund, provided grants of up to €15,000 each. A total of 96 applications were received, with 45 meeting the eligibility criteria. Of these, 33 venues were funded. The geographical distribution showed more than 40% of funded venues outside major cities and over 70% outside Dublin. Regionally, 19 were in Munster, 13 in Dublin, 10 in Leinster, 2 in Connacht, and 1 in Ulster. Due to limited funds, 12 eligible applicants did not receive funding. Officials are exploring redistributing funds if possible, and the scheme may be repeated in the future."

Ireland is world renowned for our rich, diverse and vibrant arts sector.  There have been significant increases in support for arts and culture across the country, including Mayo, in recent years. Within my Department, there are a number of measures in place to support the arts at amateur and professional levels including:  • Annual funding provided to Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann for its work in the protection and promotion of Irish traditional music and culture.  • The Music Capital Scheme, managed by Music Network on behalf of my Department, provides funding for the purchase of musical instruments to both non-professional performing groups/ensembles and professional musicians.  • A small-scale local festivals and summer schools scheme designed to support local cultural festivals and summer schools that may not be eligible under funding criteria for larger scale events supported by Fáilte Ireland, the Arts Council and similar bodies.  • Creative Ireland Programme funding in 2025 is supporting the delivery of a number of creative projects nationwide.  • The pilot capital support scheme for the Night Time Economy will support the development of vibrant late night arts and culture scenes in Irish cities, towns and villages as well as additional capital to assist in the provision of building and equipment needs.  • In 2025 €8m, which is the highest level of funding for Culture Ireland since its establishment, will support more Irish artists to launch and develop their careers on an international stage.  • The Basic Income for the Arts pilot scheme which is €105m scheme involving 2,000 artists and creative arts workers nationwide.  • Funding for the Safe to Create Programme, including Minding Creative Minds, that supports all artists and creatives across the country.  • Funding is provided for cultural events such as Other Voices and Fleadh Cheoil na hÉireann that in turn helps to sustain the arts at all levels.  • Funding programmes within the Broadcasting and Media area also serve to promote many artists and creative talents from across the music sector.  More broadly, under the Arts Act 2003 the Arts Council has primary responsibility for the development of the arts in Ireland and Budget 2025 has provided record funding of €140 million for the Arts Council, an increase of 75% since 2020. The Arts Council is committed to increasing public engagement in the arts in Ireland, including County Mayo, and it provides financial support to a number of initiatives aimed at increasing public access, participation and engagement in the arts.  Additionally, a network of cultural infrastructure, such as The Mary Robinson Centre and Westport Town Hall, exists throughout the country with the majority in the ownership of local authorities. Annual support, including programming and revenue supports, is provided to these arts centres by local authorities and the Arts Council.  My Department focuses on providing capital grant funding to assist development and to maintain these arts and cultural facilities. Under Stream E of the Cultural Capital Scheme, grants of up to €20,000 are available at 85% grant funding rate. Local authority owned facilities are subject to a maximum 60% grant funding rate.  Larger grants of up to €50,000 are provided at a maximum grant funding rate of 70%, or 60% for local authority owned facilities.  As part of the Programme for Government, the Government has also committed to examining the feasibility of a minor capital works grant scheme to support arts and cultural facilities that are not funded through The Arts Council. Work in relation to this proposal is underway in my Department at present.  Another area of funding administered by my Department is the pilot Artist Workspaces Scheme. This was launched in June 2024 with a total fund of €6 million to enable local authorities increase the provision of Artist Workspaces across Ireland. Capital grants up to a maximum of €300,000 may be made available to larger urban local authorities, with grants up to a maximum of €150,000 being made available to the remaining local authorities, including Laois.

The objective of this programme is to assist arts and culture organisations, local authorities and National Cultural Institutions to upgrade their arts facilities or develop high quality, well-designed and sustainable facilities to maximise access to and participation in arts and cultural activities. Many of the projects are multi-year in nature and spend varies from year to year.  The B7 Subhead totaled €36.692 million in 2023 which included an allocation of €30.192 million for the year and a carryover of €6.5 million from the previous year. In that year, the total expenditure from the subhead was €25.783 million. A total of €7.8 million was carried into 2024, leaving an underspend of €3.109 million.  There a number of reasons for the underspend in this subhead in that year. In particular, the subhead funds the redevelopment of a number of National Cultural Institutions under the NDP which will redevelop the institutions for generations to come. These projects often involve the redevelopment of city-centre heritage buildings, which is a challenging undertaking by its very nature. While work is ongoing on most of the projects in the Department’s NDP portfolio, they are at various stages of project life cycle of the Infrastructure Guidelines. The development of these complex projects is based on a thorough business case process and involves economic analysis, detailed design, applications for planning permission, extensive procurement processes and the input of specialist expertise. In 2023, spend was not as anticipated due to delays in a number of projects contributing to the eventual underspend. An update on the current position of these projects and all other Project Ireland 2040 projects is available on the My Project Ireland Interactive Map and Tracker website.  Additionally in 2023, some projects across a number of smaller capital schemes did not progress within their time frame due to various issues such as delays in completion of legal charges to be placed on grantees’ properties or delays due to cost increases with grantee needing to secure further funding.

Additionally, my Department is working with Government colleagues to secure future funding in line with the Programme for Government.An amount of €10 million per annum is currently being provided over a three-year fixed term (2023-2025) to An Post. An Post then disperses this funding across the post office network, with all contractor post offices benefitting from the Government funding with the objective of securing the stability of the Network. The funding is being paid monthly for each 12-month period. There has been over €23 million claimed by An Post for the period 2023 to end April 2025 for the network.It should be noted that An Post is a commercial State body with a mandate to act commercially. An Post has statutory responsibility for the State's postal service and the post office network. Decisions relating to the network, including decisions relating to specific post offices are operational matters for the Board and management of the company and not one in which I, as Minister, have any function. The terms under which Postmasters contract with An Post is a matter between the Postmasters and An Post and any negotiations are a matter for both parties directly.",
        "formatted_question": "What specific steps are being taken to fulfill the government's commitment to fund the Post Office network, and what measures are in place to ensure long-term investment for its sustainability?",
        "formatted_answer": "The government provides €10 million annually to An Post for three years (2023-2025), distributed monthly. Over €23 million has been claimed from 2023 to April 2025. An Post, a commercial State entity, manages the network and makes operational decisions independently. The government's role is limited to funding, with no involvement in specific post office decisions."

The legislation also provided for a new regulatory framework for online safety, updated the regulatory frameworks in respect of broadcasting services and audiovisual on-demand media services and assigned to An Coimisiún the powers and functions with regard to supervision and enforcement.  Part 3 of the OSMR Act provides that An Coimisiún is independent in the exercise of its functions and that it shall submit an annual report on its activities, which is laid before each House of the Oireachtas by the Minister. The 2023 Annual Report is the latest such report available.  Part 8A of the OSMR Act provides for the regulation of designated video-sharing platforms established in Ireland including TikTok, Facebook, Instagram and X. It sets out obligations to protect users, including children and young people, from harmful online content and for the development by An Coimisiún of online safety codes. In October 2024, An Coimisiún’s adopted Ireland's first such code. Part A obliges designated platforms to have age verification systems with respect to content which may impair the physical, mental or moral development of minors. Part B, which will apply from July 2025, obliges them to implement effective age assurance measures to ensure that, for example, adult-only video content cannot normally be seen by children.  Part 4 of the OSMR Act inserted a new Part 3A into the Broadcasting Act, 2009. This Part required CnaM to establish and maintain a register of providers of audiovisual on-demand media services established under Ireland’s jurisdiction in accordance with the EU’s revised Audiovisual Media Services Directive (AVMSD). As detailed in the Annual Report 2023, CnaM published the first such register on 30 November 2023.  Part 5 of the OSMR Act inserted a new Part 3B into the Broadcasting Act, 2009, updating the duties, codes and rules which may be applied to providers of television and radio broadcasting services, and to providers of audiovisual on-demand media services. In December 2024, CnaM revised these codes and rules, which cover, for example, programme standards, commercial communications and accessibility and fairness, objectivity and impartiality in news and current affairs reporting.

The public consultation that informed the development of the National Swimming Strategy suggested that existing swimming pool stock is insufficient and, as a result, a key focus of the Strategy is on providing improved facilities. There is a specific action in the strategy to complete an in-depth analysis of swimming pool provision within Ireland with particular reference to identifying gaps in provision. Swim Ireland, the National Governing Body for swimming, is currently undertaking an analysis of the type and nature of swimming pool ownership in the country and will publish a report in this regard in the coming period. This report will be central to the future development of swimming pool facilities.  Responsibility for the delivery of the Strategy’s Action Plan will be shared across Government Departments, State Agencies and other key stakeholders, including local authorities. Sport Ireland has established an oversight group of key stakeholders to give leadership, policy direction, prioritisation and mobilisation of resources to support, monitor and measure the Strategy’s implementation.  Capital support for new swimming pools, and the refurbishment of existing pools, continues to be provided by my Department through the Large Scale Sport Infrastructure Fund, which to date has allocated €28.9 million to 9 swimming pool projects. While my current focus is on ensuring project delivery under the first two rounds of the LSSIF, 2018 and 2024, I would expect that the period of time to a future LSSIF round will be less than the period of time between the first and second rounds.

        "formatted_answer": "The new national swimming strategy was published in August 2024, featuring an Action Plan with over 50 actions across five focus areas: improving facilities, enhancing access for people with disabilities, promoting inclusion, strengthening coaching, increasing safety awareness, and nurturing talent. A public consultation highlighted insufficient pool availability, leading to a plan to analyze current pool provision, with Swim Ireland set to publish a report on pool ownership. Implementation involves collaboration among government departments, agencies, and local authorities, supported by Sport Ireland's oversight group. The Large Scale Sport Infrastructure Fund has allocated €28.9 million to nine pool projects. The next funding round is expected to follow sooner than the previous interval between rounds."

The Programme for Government commits to assessing the Basic Income for the Arts pilot research scheme to maximise its impact. I appreciate the importance of the Basic Income support for artists, which is why last week I announced that Cabinet had agreed to my proposal to an extension of six months to allow for further evaluation of the pilot data. This will also give sufficient time to engage in stakeholder consultation and to evaluate the data which will provide the evidence base for Government to make decisions on the next steps.  The primary objective of the scheme is to help artists deal with precarious incomes and to prevent talent from leaving the sector for economic reasons.  My Department has been undertaking a comprehensive research programme based on this data and is currently preparing a report examining the first 24 months of the scheme. I also recently published a paper which collects the experiences of BIA recipients, who were interviewed by a sociologist. A cost-benefit analysis paper is also being prepared. It will compare the benefits and costs arising from the BIA in order to determine its net value.  While the research phase of the pilot scheme is still ongoing, it is clear from evidence collected to date under the scheme that it is having a positive impact on participants. This data shows that the BIA payment is having a consistent, positive impact across almost all indicators - affecting practice development, sectoral retention, well-being, and deprivation.  Artists in receipt of the support are typically able to devote more time to their art, produce more pieces of work, experience a boost to their well-being through greater life satisfaction and reduced anxiety, and are protected from the precariousness of incomes in the sector to a greater degree than those who are not receiving the support.  I know that the BIA support is hugely valued by artists in receipt of it, it has also been the subject of much positive commentary at home and in an international context and makes an important statement about the value placed on the arts in Ireland.

Primary support for the arts in Ireland is delivered by the Arts Council and funding to the agency has increased steadily in recent years, reaching a record high of €140 million in 2025. The Arts Council supports and develops the arts in Ireland through grant funding, project awards, support to individual artists, and support to venues, publications and resource organisations.

This means that the local authority can seek an alternative operator for the building.  Last month, the Council called for expressions of Interest for the future management of the facility and this remains open.  In terms of support by way of capital funding, my Department focuses on providing grant funding to assist and maintain arts and cultural facilities. Under Stream E of the Cultural Capital Scheme grants of up to €20,000 are available at 85% grant funding rate. Local authority owned facilities are subject to a maximum 60% grant funding rate.  Larger grants of up to €50,000 are provided at a maximum grant funding rate of 70%, or 60% for local authority owned facilities. As part of the Programme for Government, the Government has also committed to examining the feasibility of a minor capital works grant scheme to support arts and cultural facilities that are not funded through The Arts Council.

This will also give sufficient time to engage in stakeholder consultation and to evaluate the data which will provide the evidence base for Government to make decisions on the next steps.

It will compare the benefits and costs arising from the BIA in order to determine its net value.  While the research phase of the pilot scheme is still ongoing, it is clear from evidence collected to date under the scheme that it is having a positive impact on participants. This data shows that the BIA payment is having a consistent, positive impact across almost all indicators - affecting practice development, sectoral retention, well-being, and deprivation.  Artists in receipt of the support are typically able to devote more time to their art, produce more pieces of work, experience a boost to their well-being through greater life satisfaction and reduced anxiety, and are protected from the precariousness of incomes in the sector to a greater degree than those who are not receiving the support.  I know that the BIA support is hugely valued by artists in receipt of it, it has also been the subject of much positive commentary at home and in an international context and makes an important statement about the value placed on the arts in Ireland.

For all regional capital applications, the scoring system was designed to, inter alia, reward applications from disadvantaged areas, applications that showed evidence of sharing and that had engaged with the planning process. Recommended allocations were calculated using the same methodology used for previous rounds and were based on the assessment score and the maximum valid grant.  The top scoring 45 applications received at least 95% of their maximum valid grant and only the bottom scoring 2 applications received less than 50% of their maximum valid grant.  In relation to local applications, given the scale of funding available and the time required to assess the applications, it was agreed that officials would focus on the validity of applications, on ruling out invalid applications or elements thereof. Recommended allocation amounts for valid applications were then calculated using the Pobal index of deprivation as the primary calculation factor.  The 500 applications from the most disadvantaged areas received a minimum of 90% of their maximum valid grant and only 1 application received less than 50% of the maximum valid grant.  As was the case in 2018, 2020 and 2023 allocations, applicants that charged once-off entrance fees (in addition to annual membership fees) of over €1,000 or annual membership fees of €1,500 or more were excluded.  In line with previous rounds, a review of the current funding round will be undertaken and that review will inform the timing of the next round of the Community Sport Facilities Fund. The review will consider whether any further improvements can be made to ensure that communities in lower-income or higher-deprivation areas are successful in securing funding. I would anticipate that the next round should be announced in 2026. ",

        "extracted_question": "179. Deputy Albert Dolan asked the Minister for Culture, Communications and Sport if his Department is examining ways to improve accessibility and fairness in the application process for the Sports Capital and Equipment Programme, particularly to support community groups and clubs in areas of higher deprivation that may lack the administrative capacity or resources of organisations in more affluent areas; if his Department is aware of any evidence or analysis indicating that communities in lower-income or higher-deprivation areas are less successful in securing funding through the programme; and whether this has been considered in the development of future rounds or targeted supports under the scheme. [34998/25]",
        "extracted_answer": "Minister for Culture, Communications and Sport  Over a quarter of a billion euro was allocated to 3,048 community sports clubs and facilities in 2024 from the 2023 round of the Community Sport Facilities Fund (formerly the Sports Capital and Equipment Programme), representing the largest-ever investment in sports facilities in communities across Ireland.  For all regional capital applications, the scoring system was designed to, inter alia, reward applications from disadvantaged areas, applications that showed evidence of sharing and that had engaged with the planning process. Recommended allocations were calculated using the same methodology used for previous rounds and were based on the assessment score and the maximum valid grant.  The top scoring 45 applications received at least 95% of their maximum valid grant and only the bottom scoring 2 applications received less than 50% of their maximum valid grant.  In relation to local applications, given the scale of funding available and the time required to assess the applications, it was agreed that officials would focus on the validity of applications, on ruling out invalid applications or elements thereof. Recommended allocation amounts for valid applications were then calculated using the Pobal index of deprivation as the primary calculation factor.  The 500 applications from the most disadvantaged areas received a minimum of 90% of their maximum valid grant and only 1 application received less than 50% of the maximum valid grant.  As was the case in 2018, 2020 and 2023 allocations, applicants that charged once-off entrance fees (in addition to annual membership fees) of over €1,000 or annual membership fees of €1,500 or more were excluded.  In line with previous rounds, a review of the current funding round will be undertaken and that review will inform the timing of the next round of the Community Sport Facilities Fund. The review will consider whether any further improvements can be made to ensure that communities in lower-income or higher-deprivation areas are successful in securing funding. I would anticipate that the next round should be announced in 2026.",
        "formatted_question": "Has the Department assessed the application process for the Sports Capital and Equipment Programme to enhance fairness, particularly for community groups in deprived areas? Is there evidence that these areas face lower success rates in securing funding, and has this been considered in planning future funding rounds?",
        "formatted_answer": "The Department allocated over €250 million in 2024 from the 2023 round. The application scoring system prioritized disadvantaged areas, sharing, and planning engagement. Top applications received at least 95% of their maximum grant, while the lowest received less than 50%. Local applications used the Pobal index of deprivation, with the most disadvantaged receiving at least 90% of their grant. Applicants with high fees were excluded. A review after each round informs future improvements, with the next round expected in 2026."

The Programme for Government commits to assessing the Basic Income for the Arts pilot research scheme to maximise its impact. I appreciate the importance of the Basic Income support for artists, which is why last week I announced that Cabinet had agreed to my proposal to an extension of six months to allow for further evaluation of the pilot data. This will also give sufficient time to engage in stakeholder consultation and to evaluate the data which will provide the evidence base for Government to make decisions on the next steps.  The primary objective of the scheme is to help artists deal with precarious incomes and to prevent talent from leaving the sector for economic reasons.  My Department has been undertaking a comprehensive research programme based on this data and is currently preparing a report examining the first 24 months of the scheme. I also recently published a paper which collects the experiences of BIA recipients, who were interviewed by a sociologist. A cost-benefit analysis paper is also being prepared. It will compare the benefits and costs arising from the BIA in order to determine its net value.  While the research phase of the pilot scheme is still ongoing, it is clear from evidence collected to date under the scheme that it is having a positive impact on participants. This data shows that the BIA payment is having a consistent, positive impact across almost all indicators - affecting practice development, sectoral retention, well-being, and deprivation.  Artists in receipt of the support are typically able to devote more time to their art, produce more pieces of work, experience a boost to their well-being through greater life satisfaction and reduced anxiety, and are protected from the precariousness of incomes in the sector to a greater degree than those who are not receiving the support.  I know that the BIA support is hugely valued by artists in receipt of it, it has also been the subject of much positive commentary at home and in an international context and makes an important statement about the value placed on the arts in Ireland.  A Government decision will be required on a successor scheme to the pilot, and I intend to bring proposals for a permanent intervention to Cabinet as part of Budget 2026, based on the evidence arising from the research programme and stakeholder engagement.

In line with previous rounds of the programme, a review of the current funding round will be undertaken and that review will inform the timing of the next round of the CSFF. However, I would anticipate that the next round should be announced in 2026. The quantum of funding available will also be informed by the review of the National Development Plan which is underway.",

The Programme for Government commits to supporting the sporting ecosystem so more people can participate, reap the benefits of sport, and fulfil their potential from grassroots right up to high performance level. This will be achieved through a range of measures including continuing to support the funding of sports capital projects and assessing the distribution of funding to maximise participation in all sports at community and national level, as well as continuing to work with sporting organisations to promote equality of access to sporting facilities and to drive increased participation in sport.  Organisations applying to the Community Sport Facilities Fund (CSFF) must be open to new members and must not have any restrictions on who may join or obtain full membership. All CSFF applicants must agree that, from the date of the grant, they will not deny anybody access to any facility. In addition, the Large Scale Sport Infrastructure Fund (LSSIF) requires that recipients of LSSIF funding must accommodate the needs of women and men, on a similar basis, with respect to accessing the facilities.  In 2024, Sport Ireland published its Statement of Commitment and Action to Disability Inclusion in Sport. This policy will be a key driver of disability inclusion in the coming years and sets out key actions that my Department and Sport Ireland will pursue to ensure that everyone has equal access to sport. Increased funding secured for sport in Budget 2025 enabled Sport Ireland to appoint a Disability in Sport Lead in February of this year.  Increasing female participation in sport is a cornerstone of the National Sports Policy 2018-2027 and the recently published Sports Action Plan 2024-2027. The Irish Sports Monitor report for 2023 noted that the gender gradient in sports participation had narrowed to 2.9 percentage points, dropping below 3% for the first time.
