It will also take into account developments at EU level, including relevant EU legislation currently being proposed, as well as the new EU Life Sciences Strategy which is expected to be published shortly.  The development of this Strategy is a critical undertaking, one that warrants careful planning and sufficient time to ensure its effectiveness and relevance.

IDA Ireland’s portfolio now comprises more than 1,800 clients across a diverse range of sectors in every county in Ireland. Employment levels within the FDI sector remain above 300,000 for the third consecutive year. The 2024 employment figure of 302,566 represented a slight increase (0.2%) in client employment over 2023 and accounted for 10.8% of overall national employment. Job growth was recorded in Modern Manufacturing and Traditional Manufacturing, up 0.8% and 0.4% respectively. Business, Financial and Other Services also reported an increase - 1.7% - whilst ICT saw numbers decline by 1.2%, reinforcing the critical importance of continued diversification across new and emerging sectors to drive sustained future growth.  I should also highlight that regional development continues to be a key element of Government's enterprise policy and is a key focus of the work of my Department and our agencies, including the IDA. In this regard, the IDA delivered strong regional performance in 2024. There were 137 investments outside of Dublin, representing 59% of total investments and the total number of regional jobs now stands at 165,484. The Mid-West Region saw the strongest level of growth, up 3.1%. There was also growth in the Border Region - up 2.2% - Southeast Region - up 2.3% - Dublin Region - up 0.07% - and the West Region up - 0.15%. Elsewhere, the Southwest Region was down by 0.2% whilst the Mideast and the Midlands regions declined by 3.3% and 0.45% respectively.  The new IDA Ireland Strategy \"Adapt Intelligently: A Strategy for Sustainable Growth and Innovation 2025-29\" continues to prioritise growth and transformation through innovation, digitalisation, talent development and sustainability across key strategic sectors as well as attraction of new investment in the key future-orientated sectors of digitalisation and AI, semiconductors, health, and sustainability.

        "extracted_answer": "Minister for Enterprise, Tourism and Employment  Investments by IDA Ireland client companies consistently generate highly skilled jobs nationwide. IDA Ireland’s portfolio now comprises more than 1,800 clients across a diverse range of sectors in every county in Ireland. Employment levels within the FDI sector remain above 300,000 for the third consecutive year. The 2024 employment figure of 302,566 represented a slight increase (0.2%) in client employment over 2023 and accounted for 10.8% of overall national employment. Job growth was recorded in Modern Manufacturing and Traditional Manufacturing, up 0.8% and 0.4% respectively. Business, Financial and Other Services also reported an increase - 1.7% - whilst ICT saw numbers decline by 1.2%, reinforcing the critical importance of continued diversification across new and emerging sectors to drive sustained future growth.  I should also highlight that regional development continues to be a key element of Government's enterprise policy and is a key focus of the work of my Department and our agencies, including the IDA. In this regard, the IDA delivered strong regional performance in 2024. There were 137 investments outside of Dublin, representing 59% of total investments and the total number of regional jobs now stands at 165,484. The Mid-West Region saw the strongest level of growth, up 3.1%. There was also growth in the Border Region - up 2.2% - Southeast Region - up 2.3% - Dublin Region - up 0.07% - and the West Region up - 0.15%. Elsewhere, the Southwest Region was down by 0.2% whilst the Mideast and the Midlands regions declined by 3.3% and 0.45% respectively.  The new IDA Ireland Strategy \"Adapt Intelligently: A Strategy for Sustainable Growth and Innovation 2025-29\" continues to prioritise growth and transformation through innovation, digitalisation, talent development and sustainability across key strategic sectors as well as attraction of new investment in the key future-orientated sectors of digitalisation and AI, semiconductors, health, and sustainability.

        "answerText": " Minister of State at the Department of Education and Youth  I propose to take Questions Nos. 372, 445 and 448 together.  The government is committed to the provision of additional special school places for children with more complex educational needs. Over 300 new special school places are being provided for the coming 2025/26 school year. Five new special schools are being established in addition to the eleven new special schools opened over the last few years. Special school capacity is also being expanded across a number of special schools.  As recently announced, my department will begin examining the designation of special schools in the 2025/26 school year. It’s important to note that it is not the intention to exclude children who require a special school place from accessing certain special school settings, but rather allow children with complex educational needs apply to their local special school by broadening the designation of more schools.  Currently, there are instances whereby children with complex needs cannot apply for admission to their local special school simply because they don’t meet the narrow designation of that special school. In that regard, along with providing additional special school capacity, my department and the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) consider it necessary to look at the profile of our existing special schools.  This is not a new departure. The NCSE report that over half of mild general learning disability (MGLD) special schools have already changed their policies in order to allow children with more complex needs in their communities who require a special school setting enrol in their local special school. I wish to thank schools who have worked with us to broaden their designation. My department will now engage with and support the remaining schools to embrace this endeavour so that more special schools can better support children with complex needs in their local community.  There are approximately 30 of our 129 special schools that were originally designated as schools for children with a MGLD. The establishment of these special schools predated the significant expansion in the range of supports offered in mainstream schools through additional special education teaching and special needs assistant resources and through the rapid expansion in special class provision.  It is noted that many of the children enrolling in MGLD special school do so around the transition point from primary to post-primary. The new senior cycle level 1 and level 2 programmes offers a new curriculum pathway for students with special educational needs at post-primary level now also.   ",

Deputy Eoghan Kenny asked the Minister for Education and Youth whether all mild general learning disability schools being re-designated as complex needs schools; if so, the reason for this; which stakeholders were involved in the re-designation process; and if she will make a statement on the matter. [34368/25]",
        "extracted_answer": "Minister of State at the Department of Education and Youth  I propose to take Questions Nos. 372, 445 and 448 together.  The government is committed to the provision of additional special school places for children with more complex educational needs. Over 300 new special school places are being provided for the coming 2025/26 school year. Five new special schools are being established in addition to the eleven new special schools opened over the last few years. Special school capacity is also being expanded across a number of special schools.  As recently announced, my department will begin examining the designation of special schools in the 2025/26 school year. It’s important to note that it is not the intention to exclude children who require a special school place from accessing certain special school settings, but rather allow children with complex educational needs apply to their local special school by broadening the designation of more schools.  Currently, there are instances whereby children with complex needs cannot apply for admission to their local special school simply because they don’t meet the narrow designation of that special school. In that regard, along with providing additional special school capacity, my department and the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) consider it necessary to look at the profile of our existing special schools.  This is not a new departure. The NCSE report that over half of mild general learning disability (MGLD) special schools have already changed their policies in order to allow children with more complex needs in their communities who require a special school setting enrol in their local special school. I wish to thank schools who have worked with us to broaden their designation. My department will now engage with and support the remaining schools to embrace this endeavour so that more special schools can better support children with complex needs in their local community.  There are approximately 30 of our 129 special schools that were originally designated as schools for children with a MGLD. The establishment of these special schools predated the significant expansion in the range of supports offered in mainstream schools through additional special education teaching and special needs assistant resources and through the rapid expansion in special class provision.  It is noted that many of the children enrolling in MGLD special school do so around the transition point from primary to post-primary. The new senior cycle level 1 and level 2 programmes offers a new curriculum pathway for students with special educational needs at post-primary level now also.",
        "formatted_question": "What specific actions are being taken to re-designate mild general learning disability schools as complex needs schools? What is the rationale behind this re-designation? Which stakeholders are involved in this process? Will a formal statement be issued regarding this matter?",
        "formatted_answer": "The government is expanding special school capacity by creating over 300 new places for the 2025/26 school year, including five new schools and expansions of existing ones. The Department will review school designations in 2025/26 to allow children with complex needs to apply to local schools. Currently, narrow designations prevent some children from enrolling. Over half of the 129 mild general learning disability schools have adjusted their policies. The Department plans to engage with the remaining 30 schools. These schools were established before expanded mainstream supports. New senior cycle programs offer curriculum pathways for students with special needs."

My Department has a very significant capital programme that is providing additional capacity around the country, underpinned by a robust forward planning process. Since 2020, my department has invested over €6 billion in our schools throughout the country under the National Development Plan, involving the completion of over 1,400 school building projects and with construction currently underway in over 325 other projects, which includes new school buildings some of which are being delivered in phases. Additionally, my officials work very closely with schools and patrons to ensure that there are sufficient places available each year. Good data-sharing between schools and my department is critical to this process.  The Education (Admission to Schools) Act 2018, is an important piece of legislation which has introduced a more parent-friendly, equitable and consistent approach to how school admissions policy operates for the almost 4,000 primary and post-primary schools. Under this legislation, schools manage the enrolment of around 140,000 children into Junior Infants and First Year every year and this runs smoothly in most cases. Both Junior Infant and First Year intake numbers are declining nationally year on year, and there were unfilled first year places in September 2024 across every county. However, I am acutely aware that there can be stresses for families when there is high demand for places in an area or in a particular school.  It is in that context that the Programme for Government sets out a commitment to roll out a nationwide common application system to reduce stress on parents and students during application periods. Common application systems are in place in a small number of specific areas, such as at post primary level in Limerick and Ennis, and for primary special classes in Dublin 15. There are a lot of benefits to the system, particularly in terms of identifying capacity pressures at an early point and avoiding duplication on waiting lists. I believe that the introduction of a common application system can be a game changer, particularly for parents and children with special educational needs.  My department is taking lessons from the implementation of these systems and building on the recent experience of data-sharing with schools to pilot an early iteration of a common application system at post primary level in a small number of areas for the 2026/27 admissions process.

It is vitally important that our education system is one in which every child and young person feels valued and is actively supported and nurtured to reach their full potential.  The School Completion Programme (SCP) is funded by my department via Tulsa Education Support Service (TESS) and is a central element of the DEIS (Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools) programme, a key policy initiative of my department to address concentrated educational disadvantage at school level, in a targeted and equitable way, across the primary and post-primary sector.  TESS have operational responsibility for the programme, with local projects operating under the management and direction of a Local Management Committee (LMC). The LMC is responsible for the oversight of the project delivery at local level, including the use of project resources, employment of staff, and accountability for public funds.  Since my department took over responsibility for SCP in January 2021, the programme has seen an annual increase in funding. For 2025 the total allocation for the programme is just under €37m.  Edenderry School Completion Programme delivers a programme of work to support students who are at risk of early school leaving and students at school-going age who are not currently attending school.

The DEIS programme is targeted at schools with the highest levels of concentrated disadvantage.  The DEIS programme is based on the premise that in order to have the maximum possible impact on providing opportunities for students most at risk of educational disadvantage, extra resources must be targeted as closely as possible at those students with the greatest level of need.  As Minister, I am determined to close the performance gap between DEIS and non-DEIS schools and introduce more innovative solutions to tackle disadvantage.  A new DEIS Plan will be published in 2025.

It is recognised, including by the Catholic patrons, that more diverse provision is required to cater for our changing society.  The Programme for Government commits to seeking to increase choice for parents by ensuring that families can access both multi/non-denominational and faith-based education.  The schools reconfiguration process, supporting transfers of schools to multi-denominational patrons in response to the wishes of local communities, has been developed in order to meet demand from parents and to accelerate the delivery of multi-denominational schools.  Under the Education Act 1998, the legal responsibility for transferring patronage rests with the current school patron in the first instance. A school patron may write to me as Minister for Education and Youth in relation to transfer of patronage of a school under their patronage under Section 8 of the Education Act 1998 and request that the patron register is amended accordingly.  When a transfer of patronage is planned, there are many matters that need to be discussed and agreed in advance by the existing patron and any incoming patron including practical and legal considerations.  The voice of the parent and school community is important in the context of a decision to transfer patronage and/or to change to a multi-denominational ethos. Transfer of school patronage requires time and meaningful engagement with the school community, directly supported by the school patron.  Further information for school communities regarding transfers of patronage can be found on the schools reconfiguration page on www.gov.ie/schoolsreconfiguration at the following link: www.gov.ie/en/department-of-education/publications/schools-reconfiguration-for-diversity/.  My Department has just published a comprehensive Education Plan 2025 that outlines a significant body of work that I am undertaking this year to deliver for everyone in our school and youth services’ communities.  There are over 100 actions in this plan including a commitment to launch a survey of primary school parents and guardians and pre-school parents and guardians on their preferences on important aspects of school provision and choice, such as the future patronage and ethos of their school. I intend to launch the survey in quarter 3 of 2025. I will announce further details in due course.   ",

Transfer of school patronage requires time and meaningful engagement with the school community, directly supported by the school patron.  Further information for school communities regarding transfers of patronage can be found on the schools reconfiguration page on www.gov.ie/schoolsreconfiguration at the following link: www.gov.ie/en/department-of-education/publications/schools-reconfiguration-for-diversity/.  My Department has just published a comprehensive Education Plan 2025 that outlines a significant body of work that I am undertaking this year to deliver for everyone in our school and youth services’ communities.  There are over 100 actions in this plan including a commitment to launch a survey of primary school parents and guardians and pre-school parents and guardians on their preferences on important aspects of school provision and choice, such as the future patronage and ethos of their school. I intend to launch the survey in quarter 3 of 2025. I will announce further details in due course.",
        "formatted_question": "What are the specific steps required for a school to change its patronage under the Education Act 1998? What roles do the school’s board of management, principal, religious orders, and parent’s council play in this process? Will the Minister make a public statement regarding this matter?",
        "formatted_answer": "Under the Education Act 1998, the current school patron must initiate the process to change patronage. A patron can request a transfer by writing to the Minister. The transfer involves discussing practical and legal considerations. The school community, including parents and the board of management, plays a significant role in the decision-making process. The Education Plan 2025 includes a survey on school preferences, including patronage, to be launched in 2025. Further details will be announced."

        "answerText": " Minister of State at the Department of Education and Youth  Minister McEntee and I continue to meet the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) and senior Department officials each week to track the progress being made in terms of new special class and special school places for the coming school year.  As you will know, the NCSE confirmed the sanctioning of 399 new special classes for the coming school year before Easter. This was several months ahead of last year and both Minister McEntee and have asked that this happens even earlier next year. My Department has recently issued a new Circular letter to all schools setting out an indicative timeline for the NCSE to sanction the majority of new special classes for the 2026/2027 school year by 31 December 2025.  Sanctioning the new special classes was a key milestone and reflects the core role of the NCSE and my Department to plan for sufficient capacity. The key requirement then is for schools to progress with any repurposing works, recruit staff and undertake an admissions process.  Under the new parent notification process, the NCSE had received just under 3,300 verified notifications from parents of children and young people seeking a special class or special school place by mid-February 2025. The NCSE advise that through the provision of 2,700 new special education places (400 new special classes and 300 additional special school places), along with an estimated 1,200 places being available through the normal movement of students from primary to post-primary, finishing school and vacant places, there should be sufficient capacity to meet the level of need known to them.  The NCSE in line with their statutory responsibility continue to work with schools to ensure that the remaining places available are offered as quickly as possible. The NCSE also continue to support parents to access those placements. In April, my Department wrote to all schools opening new special classes asking them to progress with admissions as soon as is possible. The position in relation to children and young people taking up special education places is changing day to day.  The NCSE advise that for the majority of counties outside of Dublin all of the children known to them have been offered a place or have a clear pathway to accessing a school placement. In relation to Cork, the new special school being established has recently opened for admissions and the remaining children known to the NCSE seeking a special school place are being supported to apply for those places. The NCSE report that there are sufficient primary and post-primary special class places available in Cork.  NCSE advise that the confirmation of special education placements is slightly behind the rest of the country in Dublin. Some of the new special classes were sanctioned just before Easter. The NCSE are working to confirm enrolments with some schools and are working intensely with other schools to confirm the children and young people to be offered places. Significant progress is being made day to day and week to week. The NCSE have recourse to using Section 67 to direct schools to enrol children if required. There has been a record level of 98 new special classes sanctioned in Dublin for the coming school year. In relation to special schools in Dublin, the 2 new special schools being established in Belmayne and Lucan have opened for admissions and will provide 60 places for children.  In relation to some of the challenges that arise in terms of matching children and young people to available places, the NCSE advise that there continues to be some children being offered special education places that are unknown to them. Some families who NCSE may have expected to accept an offer of a placement may decide not to accept a placement. Some children and young people may have a dual recommendation for a special class or special school place. Parents may opt for a special class if it is closer to them, even if they have a recommendation for special school which is why the individual casework by NCSE with parents is essential and this level of detail is known only at local level by the NCSE.

        "extracted_answer": "Minister of State at the Department of Education and Youth  Minister McEntee and I continue to meet the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) and senior Department officials each week to track the progress being made in terms of new special class and special school places for the coming school year.  As you will know, the NCSE confirmed the sanctioning of 399 new special classes for the coming school year before Easter. This was several months ahead of last year and both Minister McEntee and have asked that this happens even earlier next year. My Department has recently issued a new Circular letter to all schools setting out an indicative timeline for the NCSE to sanction the majority of new special classes for the 2026/2027 school year by 31 December 2025.  Sanctioning the new special classes was a key milestone and reflects the core role of the NCSE and my Department to plan for sufficient capacity. The key requirement then is for schools to progress with any repurposing works, recruit staff and undertake an admissions process.  Under the new parent notification process, the NCSE had received just under 3,300 verified notifications from parents of children and young people seeking a special class or special school place by mid-February 2025. The NCSE advise that through the provision of 2,700 new special education places (400 new special classes and 300 additional special school places), along with an estimated 1,200 places being available through the normal movement of students from primary to post-primary, finishing school and vacant places, there should be sufficient capacity to meet the level of need known to them.  The NCSE in line with their statutory responsibility continue to work with schools to ensure that the remaining places available are offered as quickly as possible. The NCSE also continue to support parents to access those placements. In April, my Department wrote to all schools opening new special classes asking them to progress with admissions as soon as is possible. The position in relation to children and young people taking up special education places is changing day to day.  The NCSE advise that for the majority of counties outside of Dublin all of the children known to them have been offered a place or have a clear pathway to accessing a school placement. In relation to Cork, the new special school being established has recently opened for admissions and the remaining children known to the NCSE seeking a special school place are being supported to apply for those places. The NCSE report that there are sufficient primary and post-primary special class places available in Cork.  NCSE advise that the confirmation of special education placements is slightly behind the rest of the country in Dublin. Some of the new special classes were sanctioned just before Easter. The NCSE are working to confirm enrolments with some schools and are working intensely with other schools to confirm the children and young people to be offered places. Significant progress is being made day to day and week to week. The NCSE have recourse to using Section 67 to direct schools to enrol children if required. There has been a record level of 98 new special classes sanctioned in Dublin for the coming school year. In relation to special schools in Dublin, the 2 new special schools being established in Belmayne and Lucan have opened for admissions and will provide 60 places for children.  In relation to some of the challenges that arise in terms of matching children and young people to available places, the NCSE advise that there continues to be some children being offered special education places that are unknown to them. Some families who NCSE may have expected to accept an offer of a placement may decide not to accept a placement. Some children and young people may have a dual recommendation for a special class or special school place. Parents may opt for a special class if it is closer to them, even if they have a recommendation for special school which is why the individual casework by NCSE with parents is essential and this level of detail is known only at local level by the NCSE.  In terms of data on a county by county basis, there are children who may cross county boundaries to access a special class or special school as well. As you will be aware, county boundaries not rigid in terms of schools catchment areas so that in many communities your local school may be in another county.

        "answerText": " Minister of State at the Department of Education and Youth  I propose to take Questions Nos. 388, 389 and 410 together.  There are approximately 30 of our 129 special schools that were originally designated as schools for children with a MGLD. The establishment of these special schools predated the significant expansion in the range of supports offered in mainstream schools through additional special education teaching and special needs assistant resources and through the rapid expansion in special class provision.  This is not a new departure. The NCSE report that over half of MGLD special schools have already changed their policies in order to allow children with more complex needs in their communities who require a special school setting enrol in their local special school. Any special school broadening its designation will not impact those students already enrolled.  It’s important to state that it is not the intention to exclude children who require a special school place from accessing certain special school settings, but instead to work to ensure children with complex educational needs can apply to their local special school.  There are situations currently arising where children with additional needs travel passed special schools in their locality to attend a special school further away. This is not fair on these children or their families. This is down to the fact children cannot apply for admission to their local special school simply because they don’t meet the narrow designation of that special school.  It’s also important to state that there is no strict timeline on re-designation being pursued. As indicated the department and the NCSE intend to commence work in this area in the forthcoming school year.  It is my department’s policy, in accordance with the principles of inclusive education, that students with additional learning needs are supported in mainstream classes along with their peers, with additional supports provided as necessary.  The department provides for a range of placement options and supports for schools and students with special educational needs in order to ensure that wherever a child is enrolled, they will have access to an appropriate education.  It is noted that many of the children enrolling in a a mild general learning disability (MGLD) special school do so around the transition point from primary to post-primary. The new Senior Cycle Level 1 and Level 2 programme offers a new curriculum pathway for students with special educational needs at post-primary level now also. ",

[33698/25]",
        "extracted_answer": "Minister of State at the Department of Education and Youth  I propose to take Questions Nos. 388, 389 and 410 together.  There are approximately 30 of our 129 special schools that were originally designated as schools for children with a MGLD. The establishment of these special schools predated the significant expansion in the range of supports offered in mainstream schools through additional special education teaching and special needs assistant resources and through the rapid expansion in special class provision.  This is not a new departure. The NCSE report that over half of MGLD special schools have already changed their policies in order to allow children with more complex needs in their communities who require a special school setting enrol in their local special school. Any special school broadening its designation will not impact those students already enrolled.  It’s important to state that it is not the intention to exclude children who require a special school place from accessing certain special school settings, but instead to work to ensure children with complex educational needs can apply to their local special school.  There are situations currently arising where children with additional needs travel passed special schools in their locality to attend a special school further away. This is not fair on these children or their families. This is down to the fact children cannot apply for admission to their local special school simply because they don’t meet the narrow designation of that special school.  It’s also important to state that there is no strict timeline on re-designation being pursued. As indicated the department and the NCSE intend to commence work in this area in the forthcoming school year.  It is my department’s policy, in accordance with the principles of inclusive education, that students with additional learning needs are supported in mainstream classes along with their peers, with additional supports provided as necessary.  The department provides for a range of placement options and supports for schools and students with special educational needs in order to ensure that wherever a child is enrolled, they will have access to an appropriate education.  It is noted that many of the children enrolling in a a mild general learning disability (MGLD) special school do so around the transition point from primary to post-primary. The new Senior Cycle Level 1 and Level 2 programme offers a new curriculum pathway for students with special educational needs at post-primary level now also.",
        "formatted_question": "Does the redesignation of special schools affect only children diagnosed with mild general learning disability (MGLD) or also those with dual diagnoses, such as MGLD and autism?",
        "formatted_answer": "Approximately 30 out of 129 special schools are designated for children with MGLD. According to the NCSE report, over half of these schools have already adjusted their policies to include children with more complex needs. The redesignation process will not affect currently enrolled students. The aim is to enable children with complex needs to enroll in their local schools. There is no fixed timeline for redesignation, but the department plans to begin work in the upcoming school year. The policy supports inclusive education with additional resources provided as needed. Many students with MGLD transition into special schools around the primary to post-primary shift, and a new curriculum pathway is available for post-primary students with special educational needs."

        "extracted_answer": "Minister for Education and Youth  I can confirm that my department is in receipt of an application for capital funding under the Additional School Accommodation (ASA) scheme for modular accommodation from the school referred to by the Deputy.  My department has a significant modular accommodation programme in place to assist schools in the provision of additional capacity, including in respect of facilitating the establishment of special classes. This programme involves the use of Project Management supports which is designed to enable the accommodation to be provided as quickly as possible and help ease the administrative workload for school authorities in relation to the management and delivery of projects.  A Project Manager has been appointed from the Department’s Modular Framework for the school in question and has completed a comprehensive viability report of the school site. The viability report will issue to the school shortly and my department will progress the project as quickly as possible.  The SEN re-purposing application will not be progressed as my department is undertaking a modular project for the school.  I can assure the Deputy that my department is very cognisant of the urgency around the delivery of accommodation for the new school year and is working to advance matters as quickly as possible. The provision of required school places, including for children with special educational needs, is a priority for my department. My officials remain available to provide advice and assistance to the school authority throughout the ongoing project.",

Tackling educational disadvantage and supporting students to fulfil their full potential in life is a key priority for me as Minister for Education and Youth, and for the Government. The DEIS programme is a key policy of Government to tackle concentrated educational disadvantage at school level. It provides a targeted range of supports and is additional to the universal supports provided to all schools, such as the introduction of free school books and free hot school meals.  The DEIS programme is based on the premise that in order to have the maximum possible impact on providing opportunities for students most at risk of educational disadvantage, extra resources must be targeted as closely as possible at those students with the greatest level of need.  My department invests over €180 million annually to provide additional supports to almost 1,200 schools in the DEIS programme which supports approximately 260,000 students.  Schools that were included in the most recent expansion of the programme in 2022 were those with the highest levels of concentrated disadvantage as identified through the refined DEIS identification model. Urban primary schools having the very highest levels of disadvantage are classified with DEIS Urban Band 1 status.  Research published by the Educational Research Centre in 2013 The Achievements and Characteristics of Pupils Attending Rural Schools Participating in DEIS has shown that educational outcomes for pupils in DEIS rural schools are more positive than outcomes for pupils in DEIS urban schools. DEIS rural primary schools performed on a par with urban non DEIS schools in testing under the National Assessment of Mathematics and English Reading (NAMER). Therefore, the allocation model provides a lower level of resources to DEIS rural schools, reflecting these findings.  The Home School Community Liaison (HSCL) scheme is one of the key supports provided by my department as part of the overall DEIS programme. Tusla Education Support Service manage the HSCL scheme on behalf of my department. The scheme seeks to promote partnership between parents, teachers and community family support services, with a view to supporting improved attendance, participation and retention.  All DEIS urban primary schools and all DEIS post-primary schools are included in the HSCL scheme, which currently serves 687 DEIS schools, catering for approximately 207,000 children and young people. The scheme is delivered by 528 full-time HSCL coordinators, who are teachers in these schools and assigned to HSCL duties either in individual schools or in clusters of schools.  DEIS rural primary schools have access to a range of supports under the DEIS programme including a DEIS grant, the school meals programme, access to planning supports and a range of professional development supports provided through Oide, the new integrated support service for teachers and school leaders.  In addition to the above, a pilot project to support Traveller and Roma pupils, under the National Traveller and Roma Inclusion Strategy, is in operation in 4 locations with 1 HSCL coordinator assigned in each location. A further 10 HSCL Coordinators support attendance, participation and retention among Traveller and Roma students, across 14 non-DEIS post-primary schools.  I am determined to close the performance gap between DEIS and non-DEIS schools and introduce more innovative solutions to tackle disadvantage. A new DEIS Plan will be published in 2025, and any expansion to the role of the HSCL coordinator will be examined in the context of the new plan. This plan will focus on improving the opportunities and achievement levels of children at risk of educational disadvantage, developing more innovative approaches to tackling educational disadvantage, and working towards a more flexible system of supports to ensure that a school can receive the right support at the right time.

        "answerText": " Minister for Education and Youth  I propose to take Questions Nos. 398 and 399 together.  Tackling educational disadvantage and supporting students to fulfil their full potential in life is a key priority for me as Minister for Education and Youth, and for the Government. The DEIS programme is a key policy of Government to tackle concentrated educational disadvantage at school level. It provides a targeted range of supports and is additional to the universal supports provided to all schools, such as the introduction of free school books and free hot school meals.  The DEIS programme is based on the premise that in order to have the maximum possible impact on providing opportunities for students most at risk of educational disadvantage, extra resources must be targeted as closely as possible at those students with the greatest level of need.  My department invests over €180 million annually to provide additional supports to almost 1,200 schools in the DEIS programme which supports approximately 260,000 students.  Schools that were included in the most recent expansion of the programme in 2022 were those with the highest levels of concentrated disadvantage as identified through the refined DEIS identification model. Urban primary schools having the very highest levels of disadvantage are classified with DEIS Urban Band 1 status.  Research published by the Educational Research Centre in 2013 The Achievements and Characteristics of Pupils Attending Rural Schools Participating in DEIS has shown that educational outcomes for pupils in DEIS rural schools are more positive than outcomes for pupils in DEIS urban schools. DEIS rural primary schools performed on a par with urban non DEIS schools in testing under the National Assessment of Mathematics and English Reading (NAMER). Therefore, the allocation model provides a lower level of resources to DEIS rural schools, reflecting these findings.  The Home School Community Liaison (HSCL) scheme is one of the key supports provided by my department as part of the overall DEIS programme. Tusla Education Support Service manage the HSCL scheme on behalf of my department. The scheme seeks to promote partnership between parents, teachers and community family support services, with a view to supporting improved attendance, participation and retention.  All DEIS urban primary schools and all DEIS post-primary schools are included in the HSCL scheme, which currently serves 687 DEIS schools, catering for approximately 207,000 children and young people. The scheme is delivered by 528 full-time HSCL coordinators, who are teachers in these schools and assigned to HSCL duties either in individual schools or in clusters of schools.  DEIS rural primary schools have access to a range of supports under the DEIS programme including a DEIS grant, the school meals programme, access to planning supports and a range of professional development supports provided through Oide, the new integrated support service for teachers and school leaders.  In addition to the above, a pilot project to support Traveller and Roma pupils, under the National Traveller and Roma Inclusion Strategy, is in operation in 4 locations with 1 HSCL coordinator assigned in each location. A further 10 HSCL Coordinators support attendance, participation and retention among Traveller and Roma students, across 14 non-DEIS post-primary schools.  I am determined to close the performance gap between DEIS and non-DEIS schools and introduce more innovative solutions to tackle disadvantage. A new DEIS Plan will be published in 2025, and any expansion to the role of the HSCL coordinator will be examined in the context of the new plan. This plan will focus on improving the opportunities and achievement levels of children at risk of educational disadvantage, developing more innovative approaches to tackling educational disadvantage, and working towards a more flexible system of supports to ensure that a school can receive the right support at the right time.

        "formatted_question": "Why do rural DEIS schools not have the same access to the Home School Liaison Scheme as urban schools? Will the Minister make a statement on this matter?",
        "formatted_answer": "The DEIS programme targets additional resources to schools with the highest educational disadvantage. In 2022, it expanded to include schools identified through a refined model, with urban primary schools classified as Urban Band 1. A 2013 study by the Educational Research Centre found that rural DEIS schools had more positive educational outcomes compared to urban DEIS schools. Consequently, resource allocation reflects these findings, providing fewer resources to rural DEIS schools. The Home School Community Liaison (HSCL) scheme, managed by Tusla, currently supports 687 DEIS schools, including all urban primary and post-primary schools, with 528 coordinators. Rural primary DEIS schools access other supports like grants, meals, planning, and professional development. A pilot project supports Traveller and Roma students in 14 schools with 10 coordinators. A new DEIS Plan is scheduled for 2025, which may expand HSCL roles."

        "answerText": " Minister for Education and Youth  To assist schools in terms of Wellbeing supports, my Department has put in place an Occupational Health Strategy as a supportive resource for staff and leaders in schools. The aim of the Occupational Health Strategy is to promote the health and wellbeing of employees in the workplace, with a strong focus on prevention. The Occupational Health Strategy comprises the Employee Assistance Service and the Occupational Health Service.  The Employee Assistance Service is provided by Spectrum.life and is a self-referral service where school staff have access to a dedicated free-phone confidential helpline. The service is available 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. The helpline number is 1800-411057.  The Employee Assistance Service provides advice to all school staff on a range of issues including wellbeing, bereavement, conflict and mediation. Where appropriate, short-term counselling is available to all school staff and their family members.  The service provides support and advice to managers to help them deal with health and wellbeing issues personally and in the workplace. It also provides a series of webinars and presentations to promote wellbeing in schools. To enhance the supports that are available, Spectrum Life has developed a comprehensive package of supports specifically aimed at school leaders which is currently being rolled out.  A Wellbeing in Education platform bringing together resources for school staff, students and parents to support wellbeing and resilience has been included on gov.ie (www.gov.ie/en/department-of-education/campaigns/wellbeing-in-education/). This platform provides links to an extensive range of resources available to schools from the Department’s support services and agencies and the HSE and the Department of Health.  The Department introduced a new leadership framework in 2018 which allows for flexibility in identifying and prioritising the evolving leadership and management needs of schools. This shared or distributive leadership model supports school leaders in the overall management and operation of schools. It provides for the assignment and re-assignment of post holders to specific roles and responsibilities to meet a school’s evolving needs.  Today, 1 in 3 primary school teachers hold management positions. In budget 2024, this Department provided for an additional 1,000 posts of responsibility (Assistant Principal II) for the 2024/25 school year. In budget 2025, the Department provided for a further 1,000 posts of responsibility (Assistant Principal II) for the 2025/2026 school year.  My Department is currently looking toward Education 2050 and how we take the best elements of our schools and build on this to create a system for future generations. The small schools project is an example of school communities coming together to explore and trail new ideas for the future including how admin supports can assist teaching principals with their administrative duties. It is acknowledged by my department that implementing policies while teaching can be challenging.  The project has brought small schools together in local clusters, enabling them to collaborate and identify common challenges and trial innovative solutions. New ideas are being trialled to determine whether these might help to make the role of a teaching principal and small schools more sustainable. The project has shown that small schools collaborating and working together offers promise for the future.  The schools participating across the six clusters in this project have developed good working relationships and have already provided valuable insights and ideas into supports that can be developed and replicated across small schools and I am delighted that the project is continuing for a further two years to allow further time for current ideas to be developed and some new ideas to emerge.  Effective school leadership, and governance, means effective schools. The existing models of leadership and governance of our schools, whilst very effective, also carry challenges for teachers, school principals, as well as boards of management, and the sector as a whole. Recognising these challenges, my department is now putting an increased focus on leadership and governance at school level and across the sector nationally.  My officials, in conjunction and consultation with education partners will examine current policy and practice to see what elements are serving school communities well and what elements we can improve on.

The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) has determined that there are sufficient special class places available at the primary level to meet current needs. For the 2025/26 school year, the NCSE prioritized medium and larger primary schools with available space to open new classes, aiming to streamline the process and expand provision across regions. This approach is intended to offer parents more options and reduce travel distances for children accessing special education.

Special school capacity is also being expanded across a number of special schools.  It’s important to note that it is not the intention to exclude children who require a special school place from accessing certain special school settings, but rather allow children with complex educational needs apply to their local special school.

In that regard, along with providing additional special school capacity, my department and the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) also consider that it is necessary to look at the profile of our existing special schools.  This is not a new departure.

The number of special needs assistants (SNA) continues to increase, in 2019 there were 15,950 SNA posts allocated to schools nationwide.

As the Deputy knows, it is the role of the NCSE to manage the allocations of SNAs across the country and to ensure that all of the additional SNAs provided for by this government are allocated to schools to support those children with the highest level of need so they get the highest level of support.  I have therefore forwarded your query to them for their direct reply.  Deputies are also welcome to raise such queries with the NCSE directly through their dedicated Oireachtas query line at oireachtasqueries@ncse.ie.

There are approximately 30 of our 129 special schools that were originally designated as schools for children with a MGLD. The establishment of these special schools predated the significant expansion in the range of supports offered in mainstream schools through additional special education teaching and special needs assistant resources and through the rapid expansion in special class provision.  This is not a new departure. The NCSE report that over half of MGLD special schools have already changed their policies in order to allow children with more complex needs in their communities who require a special school setting enrol in their local special school. Any special school broadening its designation will not impact those students already enrolled.  It’s important to state that it is not the intention to exclude children who require a special school place from accessing certain special school settings, but instead to work to ensure children with complex educational needs can apply to their local special school.  There are situations currently arising where children with additional needs travel passed special schools in their locality to attend a special school further away. This is not fair on these children or their families. This is down to the fact children cannot apply for admission to their local special school simply because they don’t meet the narrow designation of that special school.  It’s also important to state that there is no strict timeline on re-designation being pursued. As indicated the department and the NCSE intend to commence work in this area in the forthcoming school year.  It is my department’s policy, in accordance with the principles of inclusive education, that students with additional learning needs are supported in mainstream classes along with their peers, with additional supports provided as necessary.  The department provides for a range of placement options and supports for schools and students with special educational needs in order to ensure that wherever a child is enrolled, they will have access to an appropriate education.  It is noted that many of the children enrolling in a a mild general learning disability (MGLD) special school do so around the transition point from primary to post-primary.
