NIAC considers the prevalence of the relevant disease in Ireland as well as international best practice in relation to immunisation when developing its advice.  The current NIAC guidelines state that the shingles vaccine may be considered in those aged 65 years and older, due to the greater burden and severity of disease in this age group and in those aged 18 years and older at increased risk of shingles. Shingles vaccination is not currently provided as part of the national immunisation programme. The Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) recently carried out a Health Technology Assessment (HTA) on the herpes zoster vaccine which protects against shingles. A HTA is a multidisciplinary research process that collects and summarises information about a health technology. The information can cover a range of fields, including clinical effectiveness and safety, cost-effectiveness and budget impact, organisational and social aspects, and ethical and legal issues. The information is collected and presented in a systematic, unbiased and transparent manner. HIQA’s HTA examined the evidence on the clinical effectiveness and safety of shingles vaccines. The cost effectiveness and budget impact were also reviewed, along with the ethical, social and organisational implications of including the vaccine in the adult immunisation schedule. HIQA published this HTA on 19 July 2024. The HTA found that adding the shingles vaccine to the routine immunisation schedule, at the vaccine price at the time, for all adults aged 65 years and over would not be cost effective and would be associated with a substantial budget impact. Whilst the HTA found that the introduction of the shingles vaccine was not cost effective based on the cost of the vaccine, it found that it could be cost effective for vaccination of those at 75 years and 80 years if the cost of the vaccine was reduced by 80%. Given that the healthcare budget is finite and decisions regarding increased spending relating to a change in one area could impact the provision of other health technologies and treatments within the healthcare system, the cost-effectiveness must be considered in any decision-making process. My Department considered the findings of this HTA and determined that the introduction of the vaccine could be reconsidered when the cost effectiveness of the vaccine is confirmed as being more favourable.

        "answerText": " Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science  The decision on eligibility for a student grant is a matter, in the first instance, for the centralised student grant awarding authority SUSI (Student Universal Support Ireland) to determine.  The Student Grant Scheme, administered by Student Universal Support Ireland (SUSI), provides grant assistance to eligible students attending an approved course in an approved institution who meet the prescribed conditions of funding, including those relating to nationality, residency, previous academic attainment and means.  A Part-Time Fee Scheme for Specified Undergraduate Courses which commenced in September 2024 provides fee support to eligible part-time students attending specified publicly funded undergraduate courses leading to a major award. This includes specified in person and blended/hybrid courses and its aim is to provide additional flexibility in respect of course provision to students who are socioeconomically disadvantaged.  Please note that SUSI are unable to provide a total number of successful applicants broken down by county in Northern Ireland due to incomplete address details for the County section as provided by the applicant on the grant application form. However, I can confirm that 84 applicants who were awarded a grant in the academic year 2024/25 indicated a home address as Northern Ireland.

A Part-Time Fee Scheme for Specified Undergraduate Courses which commenced in September 2024 provides fee support to eligible part-time students attending specified publicly funded undergraduate courses leading to a major award. This includes specified in person and blended/hybrid courses and its aim is to provide additional flexibility in respect of course provision to students who are socioeconomically disadvantaged.

Ireland has a long-standing position in support of nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation. This can best be ensured in a framework consistent with the IAEA and the NPT Treaty. We hope a durable ceasefire will allow the resumption of negotiations on Iran's nuclear programme and will lead to a more general peace in the region..  EU partners are in agreement that there is an urgent need for this return to negotiations to happen. It has long been agreed that Iran should not be able to develop a nuclear device, but this should be pursued through diplomacy and negotiation. It was encouraging that EU High Representative Kallas, together with the Foreign Ministers of France, Germany and the United Kingdom met with the Foreign Minister of Iran in Geneva for talks on 20 June.",
        "formatted_question": "Did the Tánaiste evaluate whether Iran was engaged in nuclear negotiations when attacked by Israel? Is he concerned that the High Representative's lack of knowledge about key events impairs her ability to perform her duties? Will he issue a statement on this matter?",
        "formatted_answer": "The Tánaiste participated in two meetings on June 17 and 23, discussing the Israel-Iran conflict. He supported a ceasefire, advocated for de-escalation, highlighted violations of International Humanitarian Law, radiation risks from nuclear facilities, and urged coherent EU messaging. He supports nuclear disarmament under the IAEA and NPT, hoping for resumed negotiations. Additionally, EU High Representative Kallas met with Iran's Foreign Minister on June 20."

In terms of addressing these challenges in the longer term, as the Deputy will be aware, the project undertaken by my Department in co-operation with Kildare County Council on the Curragh Conservation Management Plan was completed at the end of 2024.  The Conservation Management Plan report identified a number of measures for consideration, including a recommendation for a review of the Curragh Bye-Laws and the Curragh of Kildare Act, with a view to identifying possible amendments that could potentially provide more effective solutions to the issues of illegal encampments and other anti-social behaviour. The Plan also recommends considering transferring responsibility for the Curragh from the Department of Defence to a new or existing agency that has more expertise in the field of nature conservation and heritage management, so that the full potential of the Curragh as a social amenity can be realised.

The Conservation Management Plan report identified a number of measures for consideration, including a recommendation for a review of the Curragh Bye-Laws and the Curragh of Kildare Act, with a view to identifying possible amendments that could potentially provide more effective solutions to the issues of illegal encampments and other anti-social behaviour. The Plan also recommends considering transferring responsibility for the Curragh from the Department of Defence to a new or existing agency that has more expertise in the field of nature conservation and heritage management, so that the full potential of the Curragh as a social amenity can be realised.  I am fully committed to pursuing a modern and sustainable regulatory model in managing the historically important landscape that is the Curragh and this is reflected by the inclusion in the Programme for Government to progress the transfer of responsibility for the Curragh to an appropriate agency with relevant expertise. Work on this matter is ongoing.",
        "formatted_question": "Will the Department take action to remove an illegal encampment on Rathbride Road, including vehicles and caravans with French registrations, as they did on Curragh Plains?",
        "formatted_answer": "- The Curragh, a 4,870-acre state land, is used by the Defense Forces and holds historical and cultural significance.  \n- Illegal camping and dumping have been challenges.  \n- Since October, a private security firm has served Notices to Quit trespassers.  \n- Notices were first issued in March 2025.  \n- A High Court Order was secured for removal by June 27, with notice served on June 25.  \n- A Conservation Management Plan, completed in 2024, recommends reviewing bye-laws and transferring management to a specialized agency.  \n- The government aims to adopt a sustainable regulatory model and has included this in their program.  \n- Work on transferring management is ongoing."

        "answerText": " Minister for Transport  As Minister for Transport, I have responsibility for policy and overall funding in relation to public transport. However, I am not involved in the day-to-day operations of public transport. The National Transport Authority (NTA) has responsibility for the regulation of fares charged to passengers in respect of public transport services provided under public service obligation (PSO) contracts.  In April 2023, the NTA published a new National Fares Strategy, and following this, the NTA commenced a phased roll-out of revised fare zones and structures. Phase 1 of this Fares Determination was implemented in June 2024.  As the Deputy may be aware, the second part of this Determination is currently being implemented in two phases: Phase 2A (commenced from Monday, 28 April 2025) introduced new multi-modal fare caps in Dublin and revised commuter rail fares. Phase 2B commenced from Monday 16 June 2025 for revised Dublin commuter bus fares and aligns with the new zone structure and the National Fare Strategy.  This implementation has seen the roll-out of the new ‘Dublin City’ fare zone and three new ‘Dublin Commuter’ fare zones. The new zones and revised fares will deliver more consistent and equitable fares and reduce the disparities which currently exist for some passengers, particularly in the outer commuter towns surrounding Dublin.  The fare changes have therefore seen increases for some passengers and decreases for others. It is the NTA’s intention to roll out further changes in future determinations during 2025, designed to deliver a fairer approach that is easier for customers to understand.  My Department supports these measures in line with the recent commitment in the Programme for Government to keep fares low and affordable.  In light of the NTA's responsibility in this area, I have forwarded the Deputy's question to the NTA for direct reply. Please advise my private office if you do not receive a response within ten working days. ",

However, I am not involved in the day-to-day operations of public transport. The National Transport Authority (NTA) has responsibility for the regulation of fares charged to passengers in respect of public transport services provided under public service obligation (PSO) contracts.  In April 2023, the NTA published a new National Fares Strategy, and following this, the NTA commenced a phased roll-out of revised fare zones and structures. Phase 1 of this Fares Determination was implemented in June 2024.  As the Deputy may be aware, the second part of this Determination is currently being implemented in two phases: Phase 2A (commenced from Monday, 28 April 2025) introduced new multi-modal fare caps in Dublin and revised commuter rail fares. Phase 2B commenced from Monday 16 June 2025 for revised Dublin commuter bus fares and aligns with the new zone structure and the National Fare Strategy.  This implementation has seen the roll-out of the new ‘Dublin City’ fare zone and three new ‘Dublin Commuter’ fare zones. The new zones and revised fares will deliver more consistent and equitable fares and reduce the disparities which currently exist for some passengers, particularly in the outer commuter towns surrounding Dublin.  The fare changes have therefore seen increases for some passengers and decreases for others. It is the NTA’s intention to roll out further changes in future determinations during 2025, designed to deliver a fairer approach that is easier for customers to understand.  My Department supports these measures in line with the recent commitment in the Programme for Government to keep fares low and affordable.  In light of the NTA's responsibility in this area, I have forwarded the Deputy's question to the NTA for direct reply. Please advise my private office if you do not receive a response within ten working days.",

        "formatted_answer": "The National Transport Authority (NTA) regulates public transport fares under public service obligation contracts. A National Fares Strategy was introduced in April 2023, with Phase 1 implemented in June 2024. Phase 2A began on April 28, 2025, introducing multi-modal fare caps and revised rail fares. Phase 2B, effective June 16, 2025, covers commuter bus fares, aiming to enhance fare consistency and equity. These changes may result in fare adjustments for passengers. Additional changes are planned for 2025. The original inquiry has been referred to the NTA for further response."

The Key Employee Engagement Programme (KEEP) was introduced by Finance Act 2017 and commenced on 1 January 2018, via section 128F of the Taxes Consolidation Act (“TCA”) 1997. The aim of the scheme is to support SMEs in Ireland in competing with larger enterprises to recruit and retain key employees, by way of a targeted share option programme. KEEP is a notified State aid scheme; in addition there are a number of qualifying conditions to be met. Where the provisions of section 128F TCA 1997 are met, an exemption from income tax, USC and PRSI applies to a qualifying employee on any gain realised on the exercise of a qualifying share option.  Section 128F imposes an obligation on every qualifying company to file a return with Revenue for any year in which it grants an option to an employee, or any year in which an option is exercised, transferred, or released. This return is known as the KEEP1 and must be filed on or before 31 March in the following year.  The table below represents the number of companies who filed a KEEP1 return for each year since the introduction of the KEEP scheme. As outlined, a company is obliged to file a return for each year in which it grants an option to an employee, and each year in which an option is exercised, transferred, or released. As result a company may be included in one or more tax years below.  The table below also shows the number of employees who exercised a share option and availed of the tax relief afforded by the KEEP scheme in each corresponding year. The number of employees who exercised a share option is as returned by the relevant company in the annual KEEP 1 return.  This data represents a point in time position based on the information available to Revenue. It should be noted that these figures may be subject to review and updated at a later date. Please note that due to Revenue’s responsibility to protect taxpayer confidentiality, and Statistical Disclosure Closures (“SDC”) rules, Revenue does not provide data points on groupings of taxpayers (individuals or companies) where the number of taxpayers in that grouping is less than 10.

        "answerText": " Minister for Enterprise, Tourism and Employment  I recognise the increasing importance of ensuring that the development and use of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies uphold the rights of creators, including musicians, performers, and composers. In December 2022, my Department launched a public consultation on the proposed European Artificial Intelligence Liability Directive, seeking input from a broad range of stakeholders, including those representing the creative and cultural sectors. This consultation concluded in January 2023.  However, the proposed Artificial Intelligence Liability Directive has since been withdrawn, as indicated in the European Commission’s 2025 Work Programme. The withdrawal was due to the lack of foreseeable agreement among Member States. The Commission has stated that it will evaluate whether to introduce a new proposal or consider alternative approaches to address the underlying issues.  The Government recognises the need to protect the Irish music sector and broader cultural industries from the unauthorised use of their work by AI systems, particularly in cases where such use occurs without consent or compensation.  Ireland and the EU are currently implementing the AI Act, which includes provisions related to general-purpose AI that will come into force on 2 August of this year. My Department holds a lead role in this process. These provisions will require general purpose AI providers to put in place a policy to comply with EU copyright law, and document technical information about the model for the purpose of providing that information upon request to the AI Office and national competent authorities. The AI Office, which is part of the European Commission, will directly enforce these provisions of the AI Act.  The European Commission has begun its review of the 2019 Copyright in the DSM Directive. This process is at a very early stage, and, depending on the outcome of the review process, it may result in proposed changes to EU copyright laws, including in response to technological developments and AI. My Department will engage with stakeholders in Ireland to ensure their views are considered as part of this process. ",
