Specific tax incentives are now in place to support cycling, encourage the use of public transport and support the transition to EVs.  My Department is continuously exploring ways to encourage the uptake of cycling as a mode of transport. Our National Sustainable Mobility Policy examines the different behavioural change measures that can be explored to promote modal shift away from private car use and towards zero-emission transport modes such as walking, cycling and e-biking.  The Deputy may be aware that in Budget 2021, my colleague, the then Minister for Finance, increased the thresholds for the Cycle to Work scheme to enable the purchase of e-bikes and more recently the thresholds were increased again in the most recent Budget to accommodate the purchase of cargo bikes and e-cargo bikes.  My Department will continue to undertake research into other additional measures which could be introduced to promote modal shift and encourage uptake of cycling across all demographics as part of the annual Budgetary process.  In respect of the day-to-day operations of public transport, including TaxSaver ticket offerings, the National Transport Authority (NTA) has responsibility for the regulation of fares charged to passengers in respect of public transport services provided under PSO contracts. In their capacity as fare regulator, on the 27th of April 2023, the NTA published a new National Fares Strategy, and following this on the 18th of January 2024 they published the first of a series of Fares Determination related to the strategy.  The most significant change in the fare determination was the implementation of a new ‘Dublin Commuter Zone’ this year (extending from the outer edge of the Dublin City Zone to approximately 50 km from the centre of Dublin), with simplified Leap capping, as well as changes to some Intercity Rail and town bus fares. This represents a more consistent and equitable fares approach, and one that is easier for customers to understand.  This new Dublin Commuter Zone sees the introduction of a range of Taxsaver products which will allow unlimited multi-modal travel within the zone purchased, along with zones closer to Dublin city centre. For example, a Zone 1 ticket now costs €960 annually or €96 per month which represents a saving of 38% - this is outside of the additional savings which can be made by customers availing of the product via Taxsaver.  The transition to electric vehicles is currently supported through a number of existing taxation measure including BIK relief, VRT relief and low rate of motor tax.

The Statement fulfils commitments in the National Sustainable Mobility Policy (SMP) and annual Climate Action Plans to support the expansion of shared mobility options, with a particular focus on the development of shared mobility hubs.  Shared mobility hubs offer people a wide range of choice in how they make their journeys, by providing a range of transport modes, such as bikes, e-bikes, e-scooters, e-cargo bikes and electric vehicles, on a ‘pay-as-you-go’ basis  The new Statement aims to bring greater coherence to the development of shared mobility services and hubs, ensuring that these can be rolled out across the country in a consistent, safe and measured way.  To this end, the National Transport Authority - with the support of the Department of Transport - is also developing a Mobility Hubs pilot project under the Climate Action Fund. This project will test how a dense network of hubs might be designed and operated on a long-term basis to ensure the best conditions for sustainable travel.  As part of the pilot, around 300 hubs will be provided across five urban locations. While the business case for the project is still in development, I took the opportunity to announce the five candidate locations for this pilot on 19 June also. These are Carlow town, Cork city, Dundalk, Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown, and Sligo town.  The hub networks envisaged in these locations will have a similar look, feel and operating model to the shared micromobility schemes that will be in place later this year in Cork, Galway, Limerick and Waterford (i.e. schemes that will replace the existing Transport for Ireland (TfI) public bikes schemes).  The new Statement, the ambitious pilot and the impending expansion of shared mobility schemes in the regional cities are all key steps in the 2025 Programme for Government commitment to invest in a range of transport options for enhancing connectivity and, more specifically, the pledge to establish mobility hubs in each local authority area in the country.

        "answerText": " Minister for Finance  As you are aware, in October 2024 my predecessor published “Funds Sector 2030: A Framework for Open, Resilient & Developing Markets.” That report set out 42 recommendations to cement Ireland’s position as a leading global hub for funds and asset management.  This report sets out a series of recommendations to ensure that, in pursuit of continued growth in the funds and asset management sector, Ireland’s funds sector framework remains resilient, future-proofed, supportive of financial stability and a continued example of international best-practice. Recommendations 22 and 23 of the Fund Review Report include consideration of the removal of the eight-year deemed disposal requirement for Irish domiciled funds and life products and alignment of tax rates across different investment choices.  The 2025 Programme for Government has committed to progress and publish an implementation plan for consideration in Budget 2026 taking into consideration the Funds Review recommendations to unlock retail investment and opportunities to grow this sector in Ireland. This is a complex area of taxation that encompasses a wide breadth of tax legislation on domestic funds, life assurance products and offshore funds. Detailed consideration is therefore being given to the best way to bring about the necessary reforms and to support a greater level of retail investment in capital markets. It is likely given the breadth of the Funds Sector 2030 review that the delivery of any agreed associated tax measures will take place over multiple Finance Bill cycles. This work will also take account of developments at an EU level in respect of the Savings Investment Union.  Turning to your questions regarding costs, the Funds Review Report included an estimated costing for implementing recommendations 22 and 23, noting that on a strictly static basis, the cost (excluding the abolition of the life assurance levy) could range from €256 million to €377 million. However, I note you have requested the cost to the exchequer of implementing only specific elements of these recommendations.  I am informed by Revenue that the estimated cost of abolishing the 1% life assurance levy, based on the 2024 yield, is €40 million.  I am also informed by Revenue that in relation to costing the other specific elements of the two recommendations, the cost is not readily available. While it is possible to identify the amounts of tax paid by funds in respect of unit holders, the tax paid by life companies in respect of policy holders (being Life Assurance Exit Tax (LAET)) and income tax accounted for by individuals in respect of their investments in Irish domiciled funds, offshore funds and life products, it is not possible to provide a breakdown of the tax as between the amount relating to the eight-year deemed disposal and the amount relating to the other types of chargeable events.  The table below provides an estimated amount of overall income tax arising in respect of investments in life products and funds, including Investment Undertaking Tax (IUT), LAET and income tax on certain offshore investments.

IREF WHT is also regarded as an exit tax.  *** IUT and LAET represent the amount of tax paid to Revenue. In addition to the IUT figure including IREF WHT, it is not possible to identify whether the figures for IUT and LAET represent amounts taxed at 25% in respect of corporate investors or 41% in respect of individual investors.

I am also informed by Revenue that in relation to costing the other specific elements of the two recommendations, the cost is not readily available. While it is possible to identify the amounts of tax paid by funds in respect of unit holders, the tax paid by life companies in respect of policy holders (being Life Assurance Exit Tax (LAET)) and income tax accounted for by individuals in respect of their investments in Irish domiciled funds, offshore funds and life products, it is not possible to provide a breakdown of the tax as between the amount relating to the eight-year deemed disposal and the amount relating to the other types of chargeable events.  The table below provides an estimated amount of overall income tax arising in respect of investments in life products and funds, including Investment Undertaking Tax (IUT), LAET and income tax on certain offshore investments.

IREF WHT is also regarded as an exit tax.  *** IUT and LAET represent the amount of tax paid to Revenue. In addition to the IUT figure including IREF WHT, it is not possible to identify whether the figures for IUT and LAET represent amounts taxed at 25% in respect of corporate investors or 41% in respect of individual investors.",
        "formatted_question": "Has the government considered the recommendations from the 2024 \"Funds Sector 2030\" report? Will they implement tax changes, including removing the 1% stamp duty, reducing LAET, and ending the eight-year deemed disposal rule? What is the cost to the exchequer of these changes?",
        "formatted_answer": "The \"Funds Sector 2030\" report, published in October 2024, contains 42 recommendations. The government will develop an implementation plan for consideration in Budget 2026. The estimated cost of removing the 1% stamp duty is €40 million. Costs for other changes are not available. Tax revenues from 2016 to 2024 are detailed in a table, showing figures for offshore funds, foreign life policies, IUT, LAET, and total tax."

        "answerText": " Minister for Finance  Chapter 1 of Part 2 of Finance Act 2024 legislates for the introduction of E-liquid Products Tax (EPT). Under the new law, EPT will apply to both nicotine-containing and non-nicotine-containing e-liquid products. Essentially e-liquids are liquids used in e-cigarettes including refill cartridges for refillable devices. Similar to the approach for other national excises, the taxing point will be the first supply of e-liquid product in the State and the tax will follow Revenue’s standard model of self-assessment. Suppliers of e-liquid product will be required to register with Revenue in advance of making a first supply of e-liquid products in the State. These suppliers will be liable to account for and pay the tax. The tax is subject to commencement by Ministerial Order and arrangements are underway to enable the new tax to come into effect later this year.  Ireland currently operates a tax stamp system in accordance with section 73 of Finance Act 2005 (as amended) in respect of two specified tobacco products: cigarettes and roll-your-own tobacco. Ireland’s tax stamp is part of the control regime for the taxation of these particular products. The taxation of tobacco products generally (including cigarettes and roll-your-own tobacco) is harmonised across the EU, which makes the products subject to the strict control and movement system for excisable products (EMCS). The control regime also applies to mineral oils and alcohol. The EMCS is an EU-wide system, administered by national tax authorities, under which the movement of the product is tightly controlled through authorised tax warehouses with duty suspension arrangements. The charge to tax on a harmonised excisable product (such as tobacco) arises when the product is ‘released for consumption’ from the tax warehouse, and in the case of the specified tobacco products, this is the point at which the tax stamps are applied.  As a non-harmonised national excise, the operation of EPT has to be compatible with the EU Single Market rules which preclude the use of cross-border movement controls. These rules mean that e-liquid products coming into the State from other Member States or Northern Ireland (which is part of the Single Market for goods) cannot be subject to the type of cross-border movement controls that are integral to the regime for the existing EU-harmonised excises, such as tobacco.  During the design of EPT, serious consideration was given by Revenue and my Department to the appropriate charging point for the tax. Approaches to other Irish excises were considered as were approaches to similar taxes in other countries. It was concluded that charging EPT at the point of first supply of the product in the State is, on balance, the most appropriate approach. In particular, the alternative model of a ‘released for consumption’ approach to charging EPT would require the development and operation of a complex national (non-EMCS) system of tax warehousing and controls; crucially, these could only have very limited effectiveness in a non-harmonized regime - given that they could only operate on a national basis and without recourse to cross-border controls - and the cost of setting up and operating such a system could not be justified given such limitations on its potential effectiveness.  Ireland’s existing tax stamp is closely integrated to the ‘released for consumption’ tax model used for tobacco. Having regard to the different tax model (‘first supply’) that has been legislated for EPT, it is not clear at this stage that a tax stamp would be a useful tool in securing the collection of the new tax. However, this could be reviewed in the future, in light of the actual experience of operating EPT when it is up and running.  The Deputy raises some issues related to regulation of the vaping industry, including effective restriction of the sale of illegal products. Policy and legislation regarding e-liquid and e-cigarette products, including regulation of their content, and of their sale and promotion is dealt with by my colleague the Minister for Health and her Department, and enforced principally through the network of Environmental Health Officers operating under the Health Service Executive. This will remain the case following the commencement of EPT. ",

The tax is levied at the point of the first supply in Ireland, requiring suppliers to register with Revenue and pay the tax. The system is set to commence later this year. Unlike the EU-harmonized tax stamp system used for tobacco, EPT is a non-harmonized tax, making cross-border controls infeasible.

This was achieved through the AIB share trading plan along with seven accelerated bookbuild (ABB) transactions and various directed share buyback transactions with the bank.  The trading plan and each subsequent ABB transaction were successful in gradually reducing the State’s investment in the bank and improving liquidity in the shares. Throughout each phase of the trading plan and through the larger block sales, the State has been selling into a rising share price environment. The AIB share price at the start of 2022 was 224c per share, while at close of business on 16 June 2025 it was 701c per share. It is important to understand that there is no other way to exit these large bank investments. The State cannot wait until some supposed peak in the stock market and then suddenly sell billions of euros of shares to investors in one transaction. Rather, the approach of incrementally selling blocks of shares creates greater liquidity which in turn attracts additional sell-side research coverage and a deeper pool of buy-side investor interest.  A further €2.3 billion of investment income (including dividends) was received and combined with €1.8bn of CIFS and ELG fees, a total of €19.8bn has been returned to the State.     -     €bn       Sale/redemption proceeds          Cancellation of Preference Share warrants    0.05      Sale/redemption of Contingent Convertible bonds    1.76      Sale/redemption of Preference Shares    1.87      IPO proceeds    3.43      Share sales proceeds (since 2022)    8.67          15.78      Investment Income          Contingent Convertible bond coupon    0.64      Preference Shares coupon    028      Dividends    1.36          2.28      CIFS/ELG    1.78      Total    19.84        ",

An individual will normally pay income tax, PRSI and USC on their employment income and earnings, and the rates at which they are liable to these charges is dependent on their overall level of income and their own specific circumstances.  However, the average effective tax rates for individuals at various income levels were published as part of the Budget 2025 documentation in the Tax Policy Changes document. This document includes tables that show the average effective tax rates on a range of annual earnings in respect of income tax, PRSI and USC as a proportion of gross income. This is available by various household types, including single persons, married couples with children, PAYE and self-employed income earners over a wide distribution of income levels between €15,000 and €120,000 from 2009 to 2025.  This document also includes detailed distributional analysis of the tax measures announced in Budget 2025, which demonstrate the effect of changes to some payments from the Department of Social Protection such as Child Benefit and the Working Family payment.  The document is available at the following link: assets.gov.ie/static/documents/budget-2025-tax-policy-changes.pdf.",
        "formatted_question": "What are the estimated tax yields from a percentage point increase in the minimum effective tax rate on individual earnings in 2026 and from a €10,000 reduction in the earnings level where this rate applies?",
        "formatted_answer": "The requested tax yield analysis cannot be performed as the Irish tax system does not feature a minimum effective tax rate. However, the Budget 2025 document provides average effective tax rates for various income levels and household types, ranging from €15,000 to €120,000. This information is available in the Tax Policy Changes document at [assets.gov.ie/static/documents/budget-2025-tax-policy-changes.pdf](https://assets.gov.ie/static/documents/budget-2025-tax-policy-changes.pdf)."

At the core of these measures is identifying and targeting the smuggling of illicit tobacco products into the State, with a view to disrupting the supply chain, seizing the products and, where possible, prosecuting those involved. Revenue’s strategy involves developing and sharing intelligence on a national, EU and international basis, the use of analytics and detection technologies, and ensuring the optimum deployment of resources on a risk-focused basis.  The smuggling of tobacco products has a transnational and cross border dimension and, in addition to Revenue’s ongoing cooperation with An Garda Síochána in this area, Revenue also works closely with its counterparts in other jurisdictions including colleagues in Northern Ireland through the cross border Joint Agency Task Force (JATF), and international bodies including OLAF (the EU’s anti-fraud agency), Europol and the World Customs Organisation.  The JATF was established under the 2015 Fresh Start Agreement and is an excellent example of successful cross border partnership to tackle organised and cross jurisdictional crime on the island of Ireland. It is led by senior officers on both a strategic and operational level from Revenue, HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC), An Garda Síochána and the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) with the Criminal Assets Bureau and National Crime Agency involved as needed in operational activity. Revenue alongside HMRC lead on the Excise Fraud Priority. The JATF promotes real-time collaboration between Revenue and HMRC in efforts to disrupt the activities of organised crime groups involved in serious excise fraud.  I am advised by Revenue that the JATF produces a report twice yearly. The most recent report relates to the period October 2024 to March 2025 and highlights a number of specific joint operational successes including in the areas of excise fraud, drugs trafficking and rural crime. There were 6 excise operations outlined in the most recent report and 4 for the previous reporting period (1 April 2024 to 30 September 2024), highlighting the significant level of cooperation and operational activity between Revenue and the HMRC in tackling excise fraud.

The Civil Service Competency Framework supports development of the relevant skills needed by civil and public servants, and further supports capability building for individuals across all roles responsible for delivering on behalf of our Government and the people of Ireland.  My Department supports procurement functions and practice for public servants working in procurement roles across Government Departments and agencies through a range of activities designed to support compliance and strengthen procurement skills and capabilities, such as:  • My Department published an Information note in January 2019 addressing the Procurement Officer Role. The purpose of this information note is to outline the role of a Procurement Officer in organisations that carry out public procurement and identifies the policy and governance context for Procurement Officers, with regard to the National Public Procurement Policy Framework.  • A number of initiatives undertaken at a national level by the OGP to enable better public procurement practice include continuous ongoing enhancements to the suite of guidance for public buyers and suppliers, template tender and contract documents, the Public Procurement Guidelines for Goods and Services update Version 3, the development of a digital Green Public Procurement Criteria Search tool, the publication of circular 05/2023 to support SME participation and the launch of the new national eTenders platform.  • The OGP promotes ongoing and active engagement with the wider public sector through a range of stakeholder events aimed at fostering awareness and promoting compliance with the public procurement regime in addition to a programme of client-facing events. This programme consists of:  • Information Sessions on central arrangements  • Procurement Officer Networks forums  • Bi-annual Client Conference  • My Department has published a wide range of training, guidance and reference information and resources which is made available online, to help public procurement staff use the eTenders platform and comply with the procedures and policies that govern public procurement in Ireland. This ranges from detailed guidance documents to short task-specific video tutorials to facilitate self-paced learning. My Department also provides direct support to civil and public bodies in relation to public procurement matters through the OGP Support service and the various in-person and online events that are either hosted or supported by the OGP.  • In support of the delivery of the Capital Works Management Framework, the National Development Plan and Project Ireland 2024, the Commercial Skills Academy offer practical training to both developing and experienced practitioners. The training offerings include modular eLearning courses, information sessions, communities of practice networks and classroom training, providing procurement practitioners with an understanding of key issues, commercial skills, and best practice approaches for effective project delivery throughout the entire lifecycle of a public works project.  Finally, my Department is investigating the suitability and feasibility of creating a public procurement technical skills framework, and the potential application of any such framework with a view to further strengthening commercial and procurement capabilities.

This data was also used, on an aggregated basis, as the basis for the ‘Spend Data’ component of an annual ‘Public Service Spend and Tendering Analysis’ report. The other component of the report being ‘Tendering Analysis’, used data captured via the national electronic tendering platform, eTenders. The OGP has published seven such Public Service Spend and Tendering Analysis Reports for 2013 – 2019.  Following the introduction of the EU General Data Protection Regulation and associated amendments to national data protection legislation in 2018, and due to the potential for procurement addressable expenditure data to contain personal data, following the completion of the 2019 data report, the OGP ceased the collection of said data from public bodies. This decision was taken on foot of legal advices at that time. Subsequent to this, the OGP were engaged with public sector bodies on a number of other significant events that required their cooperation and resources, in particular the design, implementation and transition to a new national electronic tendering platform.  While my department recognises the importance and benefit of having visibility of procurement addressable spend from across the public service, the OGP has no legal basis or ability to access that data. However, we are exploring options to address the data protection constraints that have arisen, the OGP also sees this as an opportunity to consider reviewing the overall approach and mechanism used to collect and process this type of data.  The process for the collection of procurement addressable expenditure data from a sample of public service bodies was carried out on a voluntary basis by those public bodies and involved the extraction of finance data from a multitude of different financial systems from across the public service. It required the public bodies involved to have inhouse ICT systems and data processing capabilities, the data was generated from a wide range of financial systems, in various formats and quality, and in some cases the process involved significant lead times to facilitate the completion of end-of-year financial accounting procedures before the information could be shared with the OGP. This raised a number of challenges in terms of processing the data and also resulted in a lag between the reporting period of the data and the publication timeline.  Given the new data protection considerations that have arisen, and the general challenges experienced in collecting and making the procurement addressable expenditure data available, the OGP are exploring new approaches to re-activating public procurement reporting that provides an overview of public procurement activity, with a greater focus initially on tendering data which is more readily available and within their control for processing. While a timeline is not currently available on this initiative, the OGP would be happy to advise as soon as a timeline becomes available.

        "answerText": " Minister of State at the Department of Public Expenditure, Infrastructure, Public Service Reform and Digitalisation  The Office of Public Works (OPW) has responsibility, on behalf of the state, for managing and maintaining a substantial and complex estate portfolio. This includes office accommodation for all Government Departments, the property estate for An Garda Síochána and numerous properties for many State Agencies. However, this does not extend to all public buildings, with other bodies such as the Health Services Executive and Local Authorities, having large portfolios of public buildings under their remit.  The Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (EU) 2024/1975 was transposed into Irish law on 3rd January 2025 through Statutory Instrument No. 749/2024 – European Union (Energy Performance of Buildings) Regulations 2024.  This directive forms a key part of the States strategy to its reduction of Greenhouse Gas emission reduction by 2030 and achievement of net zero by 2050.  This EPBD directive is a key legislative measure aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions from energy use in buildings The requirements of the EPBD have also been included in the Climate Action Plan 2025 under which the OPW have obligations. To address these obligations the OPW is also a member of this Heat and Built Environment Task Force and the associated Public Sector Buildings Working Group. This working group is developing a Road Map report for Government to provide direction for decarbonisation of the public sector building stock.

        "extracted_answer": "Minister of State at the Department of Public Expenditure, Infrastructure, Public Service Reform and Digitalisation  The Office of Public Works (OPW) has responsibility, on behalf of the state, for managing and maintaining a substantial and complex estate portfolio. This includes office accommodation for all Government Departments, the property estate for An Garda Síochána and numerous properties for many State Agencies. However, this does not extend to all public buildings, with other bodies such as the Health Services Executive and Local Authorities, having large portfolios of public buildings under their remit.  The Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (EU) 2024/1975 was transposed into Irish law on 3rd January 2025 through Statutory Instrument No. 749/2024 – European Union (Energy Performance of Buildings) Regulations 2024.  This directive forms a key part of the States strategy to its reduction of Greenhouse Gas emission reduction by 2030 and achievement of net zero by 2050.  This EPBD directive is a key legislative measure aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions from energy use in buildings The requirements of the EPBD have also been included in the Climate Action Plan 2025 under which the OPW have obligations. To address these obligations the OPW is also a member of this Heat and Built Environment Task Force and the associated Public Sector Buildings Working Group. This working group is developing a Road Map report for Government to provide direction for decarbonisation of the public sector building stock.  While the EPBD introduces ambitious targets, not all public buildings are required to meet the requirements immediately. The EPBD outlines phased implementation measures to be introduced.  As a State Body, the OPW is committed to complying with Government policy and regulatory requirements under the EPBD.

How many public buildings have been retrofitted each year from 2015 to 2025? How many buildings do not meet the standard and what percentage do they represent?",
        "formatted_answer": "The Office of Public Works (OPW) manages certain public buildings. The Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (EPBD) was implemented in Irish law in 2025. The directive aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The OPW is part of a task force focused on decarbonizing public buildings. By 2028, new OPW buildings must be zero-emission, and existing large buildings must assess solar energy feasibility. Some buildings, like Tom Johnson House and Leeson Lane, have been retrofitted to meet energy standards. No specific data is provided on annual retrofit counts or non-compliant building proportions."
