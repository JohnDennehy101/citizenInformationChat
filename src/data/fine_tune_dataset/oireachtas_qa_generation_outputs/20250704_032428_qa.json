While most Irish exporters are currently subject to additional 10% tariffs, exporters of pharmaceutical products are not. However, we must be up front that, while the negotiations between the EU and US are underway, there are still risks of further sectoral tariffs, including on the pharmaceutical industry. The Deputy will be aware that a US Section 232 national security investigation into imports of pharmaceuticals and pharmaceutical ingredients is ongoing. This may lead to further actions being taken by the US Administration on imports of pharmaceuticals.  I have on several occasions raised the mutually beneficial and interconnected nature of the Irish, European and American pharmaceutical industry with the US Administration, including with Commerce Secretary Lutnick in April and most recently with US Trade Representative, Ambassador Greer earlier this month.  I have also conveyed our sensitivities regarding this industry to the European Commission, including during my call last week with Trade Commissioner Šefcovic. I believe that the strategic importance of the pharmaceutical industry to the EU as a whole is well understood.  Furthermore, my officials and I have also engaged intensively with stakeholders, including through the Government Trade Forum, to understand the potential impacts on the industry of US tariffs and EU re-balancing measures, if they were to be put in place.

A mutually beneficial agreement that works for both sides is the objective. The Government welcomes the intensification of EU trade negotiations with the US in recent weeks.

The Passport Service is successfully meeting high demand for passports and has issued over 532,000 passports this year to date.  My Department engages in comprehensive workforce planning annually, based on forecasted passport demand. Staffing requirements for the upcoming year are formally approved by the Department’s Management Board on a yearly basis. As a result of this proactive approach, the Passport Service is well-positioned to meet forecasted demand for the remainder of the year.  Adequate staffing of the Passport Service to respond to demand continues to be a priority for the Department in 2025 and is an issue that is kept under constant review. To address the increased demand typically experienced during the busy spring and summer period, 133 TCOs have been assigned to the Passport Service since November 2024, ensuring adequate staffing levels. My Department is implementing this year's staffing plan so that excellent customer service is maintained throughout periods of peak demand and is continuing to work to increase resources within the service.  The payroll costs incurred by the Department in relation to staffing in the Passport Service for the years 2020 to 31 May 2025 are outlined in Table 1 below.   Table 1 – Payroll Costs for Passport Service       Year      Amount       2020    €19,882,953      2021    €18,508,734      2022    €28,726,609      2023    €30,869,253      2024    €32,876,278      2025    €17,470,773         Table 2 below outlines the annual number of staff by grade from 2020 to present.

These costs are based on the salary costs associated with Clerical Officers (COs), Executive Officers (EOs), and Higher Executive Officers (HEOs) on the mid-point of the scale and include the employer's PRSI contribution costs. The management structure outlined in the table correlates to the ratio of managers to staff typical in the Passport Service. These costs do not include additional costs that would be incurred by an increase in staff including accommodation, utilities and equipment costs.

Staffing requirements for the upcoming year are formally approved by the Department’s Management Board on a yearly basis. As a result of this proactive approach, the Passport Service is well-positioned to meet forecasted demand for the remainder of the year.  Adequate staffing of the Passport Service to respond to demand continues to be a priority for the Department in 2025 and is an issue that is kept under constant review. To address the increased demand typically experienced during the busy spring and summer period, 133 TCOs have been assigned to the Passport Service since November 2024, ensuring adequate staffing levels. My Department is implementing this year's staffing plan so that excellent customer service is maintained throughout periods of peak demand and is continuing to work to increase resources within the service.  The payroll costs incurred by the Department in relation to staffing in the Passport Service for the years 2020 to 31 May 2025 are outlined in Table 1 below.   Table 1 – Payroll Costs for Passport Service       Year      Amount       2020    €19,882,953      2021    €18,508,734      2022    €28,726,609      2023    €30,869,253      2024    €32,876,278      2025    €17,470,773         Table 2 below outlines the annual number of staff by grade from 2020 to present.

The performance of all public transport operators is monitored by the National Transport Authority (NTA), and the contractual arrangements put in place allow for financial penalties where performance does not meet the required standard, including services operated by Go-Ahead.  Regarding your specific question about engagement with the NTA prior to contract renewal, the NTA has indicated that they will collaborate with Go-Ahead to further enhance service reliability, and they are monitoring performance issues which will inform future service improvements. Additionally, the new contract includes enhanced performance standards aimed at improving service across routes.  Following an open competitive tendering process, Go-Ahead was identified as the preferred tenderer for the retendered contract. This new contract will commence on 21st October 2025 for an initial period of five years, with an option to extend by a further two years.  I have been advised that the overall performance of Go-Ahead Ireland over the lifetime of the contract in delivering reliable services has been good and compares favourably with other operators including Dublin Bus. Recent customer satisfaction surveys show overall satisfaction with Go-Ahead services in Dublin scoring highly, and above other large bus operators operating services on behalf of the NTA.  Despite the recent challenges, which have improved significantly, the NTA believe that Go-Ahead has the capacity and capability to deliver the services, and the strengthened performance obligations in the new contract will support this.  Further in line with the Programme for Government commitment to “enhance and support the delivery of a skilled workforce to maintain and operate public transport vehicles” , my Department has established a taskforce dedicated to identifying solutions to address the ongoing workforce challenges for operators such as Go-Ahead to assist their service delivery.

        "answerText": " Minister for Transport  The Irish Government’s road safety strategy 2021 to 2030 ‘Our Journey Towards Vision Zero ’, as published by the Road Safety Authority, includes the primary aim of reducing the number of deaths and serious injuries on our roads in half by 2030 and to achieve ‘Vision Zero’, zero deaths or serious injuries, by 2050. To help achieve this aim the strategy included an action for a working group to be established to review the framework for the setting of speed limits and to give specific consideration to the introduction of a 30kph default speed limit in urban areas.  Accordingly, this working group was established, and it comprised representatives from the City & County Managers Association, the Road Safety Authority, an Garda Síochána, the National Transport Authority, Transport Infrastructure Ireland, and the Department of Transport. Their work led to the publication of the ‘ Speed Limit Review’ in 2023' , which included a number of principal recommendations concerning speed limit reductions in the interest of improving road safety:  1. A reduction in the default speed limit on rural local roads from 80km/h to 60km/h.  2. The introduction of a 30km/h default speed limit in built-up and urban areas.  3. A reduction in the default speed limit on national secondary roads from 100km/h to 80km/h.  The first phase, the change in the default speed limit on rural local roads from 80km/h to 60km/h took effect nationally on the 7th February 2025.  The second phase of the proposed speed limit changes concerns the introduction of a 30km/h speed limit in urban areas. It is intended that this speed limit change will be introduced, at this time, by way of ‘ special speed limit bye-laws ’, rather than a change in the ‘ default speed limit ’. Accordingly, in respect of those roads in urban areas where local authorities propose to change existing speed limits to 30km/h, it will be necessary for each local authority to undertake a statutory public consultation process and consider representations, in accordance with the requirements of the ‘ Road Traffic Act 2004 ’, as amended. As the making of ‘ special speed limit bye-laws ’ is a reserved function, the speed limits on roads in urban areas will only be changed where a majority of the elected members vote to do so.  To assist local authorities with the process of setting ‘ special speed limits’ in urban areas and the attendant bye-laws procedures, a working group is presently revising the ‘ Guidelines for Setting and Managing Speed Limits in Ireland ’. Five regional workshops were held with local authorities during April 2025, for the purpose of highlighting the proposed revisions to the ‘ Guidelines ’, together with the procedures to be followed, and the criteria to be considered by local authorities, in respect of setting speed limits in urban areas. The workshops also provided an opportunity to gather feedback from local authorities for the purpose of improving the ‘ Guidelines ’.  It is expected that the ‘ Guidelines ’ will be finalised in Quarter 3, this year, and thereafter issue to the Minister. Subject to the Minister’s approval, it is envisaged that the updated ‘ Guidelines ’ will issue to local authorities with a direction to commence the process of reviewing existing speed limits in urban areas in their respective administrative areas, and to set appropriate speed limits in accordance with the ' Guidelines '.  The Department of Transport provided funding to local authorities for the procurement and installation of poles and signs associated with the change in the default speed limit on rural local roads from 80km/h to 60km/h. It is intended that a similar funding arrangement will be put in place by the Department of Transport, to fund costs associated with the procurement and installation of poles and signs for the proposed speed limit changes in urban areas.  With regard to the Department providing funding for engineering solutions, such as raised crossings, it should be noted that each year the Department of Transport provides grant allocations to local authorities in respect of the maintenance and improvement of regional and local roads. The total regional and local road grant allocation for 2025 is €713.67 million. This funding is provided under various grant headings, with a focus on road maintenance and improvement works which promote the safety of all road users, including cyclists and pedestrians.  Grant categories include, for example, ' Low Cost Safety Schemes ', ' Specific grants ' and ' Discretionary Grants '. The initial selection and prioritisation of works to be funded under these grant categories is a matter for the local authority. Local authorities may therefore apply for funding for schemes that improve road safety, including engineering solutions to improve safety and/or reduce traffic speeds.  Furthermore, state grants for road works on regional and local roads are provided on the basis that they supplement contributions from local authority own resources. Engineering solutions to reduce traffic speeds can also therefore, be funded from the local authorities' own resources, as the improvement and maintenance of regional and local roads is the statutory responsibility of each local authority, in accordance with the provisions of Section 13 of the ' Roads Act 1993 '.

        "extracted_answer": "Minister for Transport  The Irish Government’s road safety strategy 2021 to 2030 ‘Our Journey Towards Vision Zero ’, as published by the Road Safety Authority, includes the primary aim of reducing the number of deaths and serious injuries on our roads in half by 2030 and to achieve ‘Vision Zero’, zero deaths or serious injuries, by 2050. To help achieve this aim the strategy included an action for a working group to be established to review the framework for the setting of speed limits and to give specific consideration to the introduction of a 30kph default speed limit in urban areas.  Accordingly, this working group was established, and it comprised representatives from the City & County Managers Association, the Road Safety Authority, an Garda Síochána, the National Transport Authority, Transport Infrastructure Ireland, and the Department of Transport. Their work led to the publication of the ‘ Speed Limit Review’ in 2023' , which included a number of principal recommendations concerning speed limit reductions in the interest of improving road safety:  1. A reduction in the default speed limit on rural local roads from 80km/h to 60km/h.  2. The introduction of a 30km/h default speed limit in built-up and urban areas.  3. A reduction in the default speed limit on national secondary roads from 100km/h to 80km/h.  The first phase, the change in the default speed limit on rural local roads from 80km/h to 60km/h took effect nationally on the 7th February 2025.  The second phase of the proposed speed limit changes concerns the introduction of a 30km/h speed limit in urban areas. It is intended that this speed limit change will be introduced, at this time, by way of ‘ special speed limit bye-laws ’, rather than a change in the ‘ default speed limit ’. Accordingly, in respect of those roads in urban areas where local authorities propose to change existing speed limits to 30km/h, it will be necessary for each local authority to undertake a statutory public consultation process and consider representations, in accordance with the requirements of the ‘ Road Traffic Act 2004 ’, as amended. As the making of ‘ special speed limit bye-laws ’ is a reserved function, the speed limits on roads in urban areas will only be changed where a majority of the elected members vote to do so.  To assist local authorities with the process of setting ‘ special speed limits’ in urban areas and the attendant bye-laws procedures, a working group is presently revising the ‘ Guidelines for Setting and Managing Speed Limits in Ireland ’. Five regional workshops were held with local authorities during April 2025, for the purpose of highlighting the proposed revisions to the ‘ Guidelines ’, together with the procedures to be followed, and the criteria to be considered by local authorities, in respect of setting speed limits in urban areas. The workshops also provided an opportunity to gather feedback from local authorities for the purpose of improving the ‘ Guidelines ’.  It is expected that the ‘ Guidelines ’ will be finalised in Quarter 3, this year, and thereafter issue to the Minister. Subject to the Minister’s approval, it is envisaged that the updated ‘ Guidelines ’ will issue to local authorities with a direction to commence the process of reviewing existing speed limits in urban areas in their respective administrative areas, and to set appropriate speed limits in accordance with the ' Guidelines '.  The Department of Transport provided funding to local authorities for the procurement and installation of poles and signs associated with the change in the default speed limit on rural local roads from 80km/h to 60km/h. It is intended that a similar funding arrangement will be put in place by the Department of Transport, to fund costs associated with the procurement and installation of poles and signs for the proposed speed limit changes in urban areas.

Member States may, if they choose, apply higher standards in their own jurisdictions.  The minimum standards of physical and mental fitness required to drive in Ireland are set out in schedule 6 of the Road Traffic (Licensing of Drivers) Regulations 2006 (SI 537 of 2006).  Individuals with visual or other medical conditions that potentially affect their ability to drive must submit a medical report, after consultation with a doctor, to the NDLS. The information provided by the medical report is considered by the NDLS when determining if a driving licence or permit can be granted or renewed.  Guidelines, ‘Sláinte agus Tiomáint Medical Fitness to Drive Guidelines’, have been developed to assist Irish doctors and other healthcare professionals to write medical reports and they provide guidance on reviewing the stability, progression, or improvement in an individual’s medical condition.

        "answerText": " Minister for Transport  As Minister for Transport, I have responsibility for policy and overall funding in relation to public transport, air transport and roads. The recent briefing note of the Northern & Western Regional Assembly: Regional Infrastructure Priorities for the Northern and Western Region, June 2025 is wide ranging in terms of policy scope and includes some projects outside of my remit.  In relation to public transport, the All-Island Strategic Rail Review, undertaken by the Department of Transport in co-operation with the Department for Infrastructure in Northern Ireland, informs the development of rail on the Island of Ireland in the coming decades to 2050, in line with net zero targets in both jurisdictions. The Review’s Final Report was published in July 2024.  The Review sets out 32 strategic recommendations to enhance and expand the rail system in Ireland and Northern Ireland up to 2050. The recommendations seek to transform the quality of the rail system to the benefit of passengers and wider society on the island, through additional track capacity, electrification, increased speeds, higher service frequencies and new and reinstated routes. This includes proposals to reinstate the Western Rail Corridor rail line between Athenry and Claremorris. Extending to line beyond Claremorris to Colloney was not included in the recommendations at this stage.  The Review also noted other potential interventions, including double-tracking between Athenry and Galway, and improving service frequencies between Counties Galway and Mayo and Athlone by building more passing loops, as well as a rail connection between Derry and Letterkenny.  It should be noted that individual programmes and projects referred to within the final Review Report will be advanced subject to funding and relevant approvals, as required under the Infrastructure Guidelines in Ireland.  Assisted by the European Investment Bank (EIB) Advisory Services, the Department of Transport and Department for Infrastructure, and agencies north and south, are working to progress the Report’s recommendations in the years ahead to help optimise the sequencing and implementation of the proposed investments. This work will inform the Department's engagement on the review of the National Development Plan, which is currently underway.  BusConnects Galway will provide a major enhancement to the bus system in Galway comprising changes to the network, the fleet, ticketing, bus shelters/poles and the development of bus lanes and bus priority. Key elements are currently under development, namely the Cross City Link project, which was approved by An Bord Pleanála in September 2024 (currently subject to Judicial Review), and the Dublin Road scheme, which the NTA has submitted to An Bord Pleanála. Droichead an Dóchais (formerly: the Salmon Weir Pedestrian/Cycling Bridge) was officially opened to the public in May 2023. The bus network design was finalised in December 2023 following a public consultation.  The new bus network will enable more people to avail of public transport resulting in increased access to a greater number of schools and workplaces across Galway City, Bearna and Oranmore. Once this network is implemented 67% of residents will live within 400 metres of a high frequency bus route (running every 15 minutes or better). The NTA plans to commence the implementation of the New Galway Bus Network in the coming years.  Regarding National Roads projects, as Minister for Transport, I have responsibility for overall policy and exchequer funding in relation to the National Roads Programme. Under the Roads Acts 1993-2015 and in line with the National Development Plan (NDP), the planning, design and construction of individual national roads is a matter for Transport Infrastructure Ireland (TII), in conjunction with the local authorities concerned. This is also subject to the Infrastructure Guidelines and the necessary statutory approvals. Therefore, TII are better placed to advise you on the status of the various National Roads Projects mention in the report.  Noting the above position, I have referred the question to TII for a direct reply. I would ask the Deputy to contact my office if a response is not received within 10 days.  In relation to air transport, national policy on regional airports is designed to optimise conditions for connectivity and regional development in line with Project Ireland 2040 as well as related Regional Spatial and Economic Strategies. Government recognises the social and economic benefits that can be derived from facilitating access to and from the regions. In line with this, Government provides substantial annual funding under a Regional Airports Programme. This Programme, which is administered by my Department, supports Ireland’s smallest regional airports, those that provide scheduled passenger services and handle fewer than one million passengers per annum. Ireland West Airport along with Donegal and Kerry airports are currently eligible for funding under this Programme. Funding under the Programme supports vital safety, security and sustainability operations and activities at these airports.  This Government’s Programme for Government provides a clear commitment to continue to invest in the Regional Airports Programme and to develop a new Regional Airports Programme 2026-2030. This new Programme is being progressed by my Department as a matter of priority this year.  An Exchequer funded Public Service Obligation (PSO) air service between Donegal and Dublin airports is also supported under this Programme. This service provides the people and business in the North West with vital twice daily two-way air services to attend medical and other important appointments. Services facilitate same day return from Donegal Airport and onwards international connectivity via Dublin Airport. My Department is currently preparing to go to tender for the continuation of this important service beyond the expiration of the current contract in February 2026. There are no plans to include a stopover at Sligo under the upcoming tender process. However, it must be recognised that Sligo to Dublin is well served by alternative transport modes, including the M4 motorway and rail services which operates up to 11 departures daily. Such factors are taken into account when determining the necessity for the imposition of a PSO in accordance with EU Regulation.  In addition, in the context of building our shared Island, the Programme for Government also includes a commitment to engage with relevant stakeholders to establish air connectivity between Dublin and Derry City airports. My Department is currently progressing the preparatory work necessary to introduce a PSO air service on this route in 2026.  The North West has established good connectivity with the UK and Europe via Ireland West and Donegal airports, with further international connectivity provided from Donegal via Dublin Airport. The targeted Exchequer funding provided by my Department to these airports has supported this connectivity, with overall passenger traffic across these airports in 2024 3% above 2023 levels. I was pleased to note a significant 12% increase in passenger traffic to end May this year.  Regarding the Port of Galway’s plans for infrastructure expansion, the Department is aware of this. As a local authority port, Galway does not come under the remit of the Department of Transport. Nonetheless, the Minister for Transport supports the development of port facilities that may play an active role in the offshore wind industry. In the 2021 Policy Statement on the Facilitation of Offshore Renewable Energy (ORE) by Commercial State ports, the Department recognised the important role that ports such as Galway can play in the developing ORE sector.  In 2022, the Port of Galway met the European Commission’s criteria for inclusion in the Trans-European Transport (TEN-T) Network. The role the Port of Galway played in facilitating the import of onshore wind turbines contributed to this new designation under new climate criteria in the regulations. The upgrade to the port’s TEN-T status means that the port can now apply for part-funding under the Connecting Europe Facility (CEF).  As part of its wider plans, there is potential for the port to support the development of ORE by accommodating an Operations and Maintenance (O&M) base. Given its position, the port may also play a role supporting the wider supply chain for ORE. The Port of Galway is strategically located on West Coast of Ireland, placing it in an ideal position to service future offshore wind demand.  Finally, in terms of our regional and local roads, the improvement and maintenance of them is the statutory responsibility of each local authority and Exchequer funding is intended to supplement local authorities’ own resources. The primary focus for investment is on the maintenance and renewal of the network. In 2025, €643 million from the Department of Transport's Regional and Local Roads Grant Programme total budget of €713 million has been allocated for such works.  In this context the three most significant grants for Councils in terms of monies and in terms of maintaining the road network in a serviceable condition are Restoration Maintenance (RM), Restoration Improvement (RI) and Discretionary Grant (DG). The amount that each local authority receives under these three grant programmes is based on the regional and local road length in each county or city area (taken as a proportion of the total road length and multiplied by the amount available for the programme) with some account taken of traffic. The funding allocations provided to local authorities of the Northern and Western Region of Ireland are, therefore, consistent with other local authorities' allocations.  There are some factors that affect each local authority's Discretionary Grant allocation which can be used for winter maintenance purposes. The cost of salt for the previous winter, which is purchased centrally, is subtracted from the gross Discretionary Grant allocation to each authority to recoup the cost of salt used by each authority in the previous winter.  There is also a limited budget available for road improvement schemes - €70 million has been allocated this year. This covers projects under the Strategic and Specific Grant Programmes. Any road improvement projects proposed by local authorities for consideration under the Specific or Strategic Grant Programmes are assessed by the Department on a case-by-case basis taking into account the Infrastructure Guidelines and the Department's Transport Appraisal Framework. Road length is not, therefore, a factor in allocating funding under these programmes.  Where projects are being implemented under the Specific or Strategic Grant programmes, this can result in significant variances between the total amount of funding provided to local authorities with similar networks and this affects total grant per kilometre comparisons between different local authorities.

        "extracted_answer": "Minister for Transport  As Minister for Transport, I have responsibility for policy and overall funding in relation to public transport, air transport and roads. The recent briefing note of the Northern & Western Regional Assembly: Regional Infrastructure Priorities for the Northern and Western Region, June 2025 is wide ranging in terms of policy scope and includes some projects outside of my remit.  In relation to public transport, the All-Island Strategic Rail Review, undertaken by the Department of Transport in co-operation with the Department for Infrastructure in Northern Ireland, informs the development of rail on the Island of Ireland in the coming decades to 2050, in line with net zero targets in both jurisdictions. The Review’s Final Report was published in July 2024.  The Review sets out 32 strategic recommendations to enhance and expand the rail system in Ireland and Northern Ireland up to 2050. The recommendations seek to transform the quality of the rail system to the benefit of passengers and wider society on the island, through additional track capacity, electrification, increased speeds, higher service frequencies and new and reinstated routes. This includes proposals to reinstate the Western Rail Corridor rail line between Athenry and Claremorris. Extending to line beyond Claremorris to Colloney was not included in the recommendations at this stage.  The Review also noted other potential interventions, including double-tracking between Athenry and Galway, and improving service frequencies between Counties Galway and Mayo and Athlone by building more passing loops, as well as a rail connection between Derry and Letterkenny.  It should be noted that individual programmes and projects referred to within the final Review Report will be advanced subject to funding and relevant approvals, as required under the Infrastructure Guidelines in Ireland.  Assisted by the European Investment Bank (EIB) Advisory Services, the Department of Transport and Department for Infrastructure, and agencies north and south, are working to progress the Report’s recommendations in the years ahead to help optimise the sequencing and implementation of the proposed investments.
