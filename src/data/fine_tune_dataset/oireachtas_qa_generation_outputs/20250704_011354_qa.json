The figure for all of those attaining State Pension Age in 2025 is just over 8,000.  The data my Department holds includes large numbers of individuals with fewer than 10 years of paid social insurance contributions, of whom many will no longer reside in the State. Therefore, to focus on those likely to be still resident in the State, my Department's officials have restricted the results to individuals who have had a social insurance record or who have been in receipt of a payment from the Department since 2019.  Furthermore, the figures above exclude those already receiving Widow/er's/Surviving Civil Partner Contributory Pension or Invalidity Pension or individuals with greater than 10 years modified rate social insurance contributions. These individuals are likely to have a pension payment from this Department or another public service body.  With reference to the full-year figure of 8,000:  • Approximately 4,000 total individuals who do not qualify at State Pension Age for State Pension (Contributory) each year will receive the State Pension (Non-Contributory) or an Increase for Qualified Adult payment. On this point, circa 2,000 individuals have zero weeks of full-rate paid contributions.  • Approximately 2,800 individuals who do not attain 10 years' paid contributions at State Pension Age each year will receive a pro-rata contributory pension when their record is combined with periods working overseas or as a modified contributor (pre 1995 public servant)  The Deputy may also wish to note the following:  • Data for self-employed contributors for 2024 will be incomplete until filings for that year are complete.  • The figures refer to those who qualify for State Pension (Contributory) by month of attaining age 66 (rather than by the year in which the claim is awarded).  • The data was extracted effective the end of May 2025.  As the actuarial value of the State Pension(Contributory) is currently estimated at approximately €385,000, I believe it is reasonable to require people claiming a contributory pension to have made at least 10 years of paid contributions over the term a 40-50 year working life, before qualifying for a payment. For those who do not qualify for a State Pension (Contributory), they may qualify for a means-tested State Pension (Non-contributory) or be eligible for an increase for qualified adult payment if their spouse or partner is in receipt of a State Pension (Contributory).

        "formatted_answer": "Irish citizenship can currently be acquired if a person's parent or grandparent was born in Ireland. The Foreign Births Register allows such individuals to obtain citizenship. There is no provision for citizenship through a great-grandparent. Naturalization requires five years of residence, with exceptions for spouses of Irish nationals. The government has no plans to introduce new citizenship pathways."

It was one of the actions contained in the “Supporting Children” goal of the Family Justice Strategy. The Review made 26 recommendations focused on generating maximum compliance with child maintenance orders, to ensure security and stability for children and to aid poverty prevention.  The recommendations, while mainly focused on strengthening provisions for court enforcement of child maintenance orders, also identified ways to encourage voluntary payment and to assist people to make private arrangements. They focus on improving the way in which maintenance is agreed/ordered, the way in which payment is encouraged, the means by which default can be avoided and greater mechanisms for enforcement.  The key recommendations of the review include:  • Development of a set of child maintenance guidelines.  • Introduction of mandatory mediation information sessions.  • Strengthening attachment of earnings orders and exploring the possibility of attaching an order to a PPS number rather than employing entities, so that orders do not lapse when there is a change in employer.  • Introduction of a single enforcement procedure when the receiving parent makes an enforcement application, allowing the judge to choose the most appropriate enforcement option based on the circumstances of the case.  • Simplification of the bench warrant process.  • Placing the onus on paying parents to pay costs associated with enforcement proceedings.  • Allowing for deductions from social welfare, the paying parent’s bank accounts, from government grants and subsidies and allowing for the recovery of arrears from tax refunds.  The Programme for Government has committed to enhancing the enforcement mechanisms for Child Maintenance orders to ensure that children receive the financial support they need from both parents. Building on the Review’s recommendations, consideration of legislative amendments to give effect to the Programme’s commitment is under way.  Further to the Review, an interdepartmental group (“The Child Maintenance Guidelines Committee”) was established in February 2024 to develop a set of child maintenance guidelines for use by all parties on a voluntary basis when putting child maintenance arrangements in place, along with an online calculator to help determine fair child maintenance payments. These guidelines will be a voluntary tool for both parents, and the judiciary. It is hoped that the use of the guidelines by the judiciary will over time further increase consistency and transparency in child maintenance orders.  The Child Maintenance Guidelines Committee has recently conducted a consultation through a survey to get the public's views on important aspects of the guidelines before they are finalised. Once the findings are considered and guidelines finalised, they will be submitted for my consideration.  It is intended that the guidelines will be accompanied by an online calculator and easy-to-use guide for parents. ",

        "answerText": " Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine  A central equine database was established in 2013 and contains the records of all equines registered in Ireland as reported by the seven authorised Passport Issuing Organisations (PIOs). In addition, EU Regulation 2016/429, the Animal Health Law, makes it obligatory for Member States to establish and maintain a computer database containing certain information regarding equines.  For each animal the database records a number of key fields, including:  • their unique code (passport number)  • the method of identification linking the animal concerned with the identification document referred to in point  • date of birth  • country of birth  • exit date  • whether a replacement or duplicate passport was issued  • whether the animal is fit for human consumption.  In 2014, it was made mandatory for all premises where horses are kept to be registered with my Department. Currently, there are approx. 29,000 registered equine premises.  In 2021, my Department launched the first equine census to gain a more accurate understanding of the equine population within Ireland. The census, which has been conducted annually since 2021, links horses to the premises where they are kept for the first time. In line with the recommendations of Professor Patrick Wall's report, Reforms to Strengthen Equine Identification, Traceability and Welfare, my Department intends to integrate the profile of the equine population gathered through the census into the central equine database for the most accurate reflection of the equine population in Ireland. Seventy-three percent of keepers have responded to the 2024 census and approximately 120,000 horses have been linked to their habitual residence as a result. ",

        "extracted_answer": "Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine  A central equine database was established in 2013 and contains the records of all equines registered in Ireland as reported by the seven authorised Passport Issuing Organisations (PIOs). In addition, EU Regulation 2016/429, the Animal Health Law, makes it obligatory for Member States to establish and maintain a computer database containing certain information regarding equines.  For each animal the database records a number of key fields, including:  • their unique code (passport number)  • the method of identification linking the animal concerned with the identification document referred to in point  • date of birth  • country of birth  • exit date  • whether a replacement or duplicate passport was issued  • whether the animal is fit for human consumption.  In 2014, it was made mandatory for all premises where horses are kept to be registered with my Department. Currently, there are approx. 29,000 registered equine premises.  In 2021, my Department launched the first equine census to gain a more accurate understanding of the equine population within Ireland. The census, which has been conducted annually since 2021, links horses to the premises where they are kept for the first time. In line with the recommendations of Professor Patrick Wall's report, Reforms to Strengthen Equine Identification, Traceability and Welfare, my Department intends to integrate the profile of the equine population gathered through the census into the central equine database for the most accurate reflection of the equine population in Ireland. Seventy-three percent of keepers have responded to the 2024 census and approximately 120,000 horses have been linked to their habitual residence as a result.",
        "formatted_question": "Does a centralised national microchip and passport database for equines exist in Ireland? If not, are there plans to establish one?",
        "formatted_answer": "A centralised national microchip and passport database for equines was established in Ireland in 2013. It includes records of all equines registered with the country's seven authorised Passport Issuing Organisations. The database complies with EU Regulation 2016/429, which mandates such systems for member states. Each equine's record includes details such as passport number, date of birth, country of birth, exit date, and fitness for human consumption. Since 2014, all premises keeping horses have been required to register with the relevant department, with approximately 29,000 premises currently registered. An annual equine census began in 2021 to better understand the equine population, with the 2024 census achieving a 73% response rate, linking about 120,000 horses to their premises. Plans are in place to integrate census data into the central database, as recommended by a report on equine identification and welfare."

        "answerText": " Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine  As you are aware, Ireland has a rich equestrian heritage, and has long been celebrated for its passion for horses and the exceptional quality of its equine industry. We are world-renowned for our affinity with horses and are proud of our reputation of being the ‘Land of the Horse’. The Irish equestrian industry has a deep-rooted history in our culture and is also a critical contributor to a balanced regional economy.  Therefore, I am committed to ensuring that the sport horse industry achieves its maximum potential, and in so doing, contributes to national economic and social development over a wide geographic distribution. This is an important pillar of current Government policy.  My Department provides approximately €6 million in funding annually for the development of the breeding and production side of the industry, through contracting services to deliver breeding and marketing initiatives and for specific equine industry projects, as follows:  • Horse Sport Ireland (HSI) is contracted to deliver National Breeding Services, which has a total budget of €4.4m per annum, while the Irish Horse Board (IHB) is contracted to deliver Marketing Services, with a total budget of €0.8m per annum.  • My Department also provides a secondary funding stream to the industry through the ‘Equine Technical Support and Equine Breeding Scheme’ (ETS), which has a budget of €854,000 for this coming year. The funding is allocated to various equine projects based on merit, using a competitive application process.  In addition, my Department is providing funding to the equine sector under the Targeted Agriculture Modernisation Scheme (TAMS 3), where equine holders now have an opportunity to obtain funding to invest in important infrastructure for their farms. Supports are available for housing, training facilities and fencing to help make the breeding and handling of horses safer for farmers and the animals.  Many small farmers have benefited from the support under the Agri-Climate Rural Environment Scheme (ACRES), with priority access through the option on the ‘Conservation of Rare Breeds’, where they keep Connemara ponies, Kerry Bog ponies or Irish Draughts. This is an important strategy of my Department to conserve the genetic diversity of native breeds that are at risk of extinction, and to endeavour to retain and, where possible, increase populations of these rare breeds to ensure their long-term survival.  Finally, as recognition of the sport horse sector's value, I look forward to continuing my support, which also aligns with broader Government objectives. ",

Under the Act, it is for a registered medical practitioner to be satisfied, following a medical examination, that a donor is no longer alive.

Insofar as it is clinically appropriate, the registered medical practitioner who certifies the death of the donor will not have a primary role or responsibility in relation to:  • the removal of the organ, tissue or cells from the donor  • transplantation activities in respect of the donor or recipient, or  • the medical treatment of the potential recipients.  Organs or tissues and cells will not be removed from a deceased donor unless the registered medical practitioner is satisfied that the donor is no longer alive, the relevant confirmation of no objection or consent to donation has been provided, and the coroner has signed off on the retrieval in instances of death falling under the jurisdiction of the Coroner’s Acts.

The Dental Treatment Services Scheme (DTSS) provides oral healthcare, free of charge, to medical card holders aged 16 and over. Services available annually and on demand include an examination including preventative elements, two fillings, extractions, and a scale and polish. More complex care, such as dentures, additional fillings and a broader range of treatments for patients with additional needs and high-risk patients, are available subject to the approval of the local HSE Principal Dental Surgeon.A package of measures was introduced in 2022 to expand the care available under the Scheme and significantly increase the fees paid to contractors. These measures have improved access to care: payments for contractor claims in 2024 show 227,691 additional treatments were provided nationally under the DTSS, with over 44,208 extra patients treated when compared with 2022. Access to care has continued to improve, an additional 2,463 patients have been treated, and a further 7,836 treatments provided in the January-May 2025 period compared to the same period in 2024.In the longer term, the Government is committed to reforming oral healthcare services, including the DTSS, through the implementation of the National Oral Health Policy (NOHP), Smile Agus Sláinte. The new Programme for Government contains commitments to implement the National Oral Health Policy and to reform oral healthcare services for medical card holders.The implementation plan for the first phase of policy implementation, to end-2027, is currently being finalised by my Department and the HSE, following targeted consultation in Q3 last year, and includes reform of services for medical card holders as one of several priority actions.The Policy also contains a range of strategic workforce planning actions to increase national workforce capacity, in support of improving patient access to care. The Department of Health has recently finalised a workforce census framework for oral healthcare and work is progressing on a scoping project for a mid-level professional grade for oral healthcare, as an additional measure to increase capacity in the workforce. A programme to encourage the redistribution of oral healthcare professionals to underserved areas is also a key action in the Policy. For oral healthcare professionals working in isolated rural areas far away from centres of education, it will be essential to provide support in the form of mentoring programmes as well as by introducing long-distance and accessible continuing development education programmes.

The Dental Treatment Services Scheme (DTSS) provides oral healthcare, free of charge, to medical card holders aged 16 and over. Services available annually and on demand include an examination including preventative elements, two fillings, extractions, and a scale and polish. More complex care, such as dentures, additional fillings and a broader range of treatments for patients with additional needs and high-risk patients, are available subject to the approval of the local HSE Principal Dental Surgeon.A package of measures was introduced in 2022 to expand the care available under the Scheme and significantly increase the fees paid to contractors.

While a medicine costing over €45,000 per QALY may not be considered cost-effective, many medicines above this threshold have been approved for reimbursement in recent years.  In 2023, a review, by Mazars, of the drug reimbursement process was published. It found that the process was operating as intended and within international norms.  Recommendations from the Mazars Report have now been implemented. A pricing and reimbursement application tracker has been launched to improve transparency. In 2024 an additional 34 staff were recruited to enhance capacity across the pricing and reimbursement system. Given the unique technical skill set required for these roles, hiring was only completed in the second half of last year.

The European Society of Cardiology (ESC) has developed the EuroHeart registry platform. EuroHeart is an IT infrastructure for continuous online registration of high-quality patient data, with real-time feedback supporting continuous improvement of care and outcomes in patients with cardiovascular diseases. Of further relevance to Ireland, EuroHeart facilitates cost-effective safety surveillance of new drugs and devices as well as registry based randomized controlled trials. The EuroHeart programme has been designed for the benefit of patients, citizens and the planning of healthcare. It addresses Ireland’s need for registry development across the cardiology landscape.  The Future of Registries Taskforce (FoRT) in Ireland recommends disease-specific registries be embedded within national clinical programmes with centralised governance and data standards aligned to international frameworks. EuroHeart provides real-world evidence to inform policy and clinical decision-making. A governance structure for EuroHeart in Ireland has been developed in which a EuroHeart Governance Board, representative of all key national stakeholders, will be responsible for strategy, oversight and decision-making, and formed under the auspices of the (ICS), as required by the ESC.

As set out in the National Service Plan 2025, the HSE’s National Heart Programme (NHP), in collaboration with the Irish Cardiac Society (ICS) and the Coronary Heart Attack Ireland Register (CHAIR), is developing EuroHeart in Ireland. The European Society of Cardiology (ESC) has developed the EuroHeart registry platform. EuroHeart is an IT infrastructure for continuous online registration of high-quality patient data, with real-time feedback supporting continuous improvement of care and outcomes in patients with cardiovascular diseases. Of further relevance to Ireland, EuroHeart facilitates cost-effective safety surveillance of new drugs and devices as well as registry based randomized controlled trials. The EuroHeart programme has been designed for the benefit of patients, citizens and the planning of healthcare. It addresses Ireland’s need for registry development across the cardiology landscape.  The Future of Registries Taskforce (FoRT) in Ireland recommends disease-specific registries be embedded within national clinical programmes with centralised governance and data standards aligned to international frameworks. EuroHeart provides real-world evidence to inform policy and clinical decision-making. A governance structure for EuroHeart in Ireland has been developed in which a EuroHeart Governance Board, representative of all key national stakeholders, will be responsible for strategy, oversight and decision-making, and formed under the auspices of the (ICS), as required by the ESC.",
        "formatted_question": "Does the government support the development of a national patient registry for pulmonary arterial hypertension in Ireland? Will a statement be made regarding this?",
        "formatted_answer": "The government supports the development of patient registries to enhance care and outcomes. The National Service Plan 2025 outlines the Health Service Executive's National Heart Programme collaboration with the Irish Cardiac Society and Coronary Heart Attack Ireland Register to establish EuroHeart in Ireland. EuroHeart, developed by the European Society of Cardiology, is an IT platform for real-time patient data collection, aiding in care improvement and safety surveillance of medical products. It facilitates research and is designed for patient benefit and healthcare planning. The Future of Registries Taskforce recommends disease-specific registries within national programs, and EuroHeart aligns with international standards, providing evidence for policy decisions. A governance board oversees EuroHeart, ensuring strategic and ethical management."

The Department of Health has recently finalised a workforce census framework for oral healthcare and work is progressing on a scoping project for a mid-level professional grade for oral healthcare, as an additional measure to increase capacity in the workforce. A programme to encourage the redistribution of oral healthcare professionals to underserved areas is also a key action in the Policy. For oral healthcare professionals working in isolated rural areas far away from centres of education, it will be essential to provide support in the form of mentoring programmes as well as by introducing long-distance and accessible continuing development education programmes.",
        "formatted_question": "What are the plans to increase the number of dental practitioners providing care to medical card holders in Ireland?",
        "formatted_answer": "The Dental Treatment Services Scheme (DTSS) offers free oral healthcare to medical card holders aged 16 and older, including services like exams, fillings, extractions, and cleanings. In 2022, measures were introduced to expand care and boost fees, resulting in 227,691 additional treatments and 44,208 extra patients in 2024, with further increases in 2025. The government aims to reform oral healthcare through the National Oral Health Policy (NOHP), with plans to implement reforms by 2027. This includes a workforce census, a mid-level professional grade to increase capacity, and a program to redistribute professionals to underserved areas. Support for rural workers includes mentoring and accessible education programs."

        "answerText": " Minister for Health  Provisions to mitigate period poverty have been included in the Programme for Government, Securing Ireland's Future. Commitments include:  • Developing a plan to make free period products accessible in more locations (Women’s Health).• Provision of free period products in schools to ensure no student is held back due to period poverty (Education).  The Department of Health established an inter-Departmental Period Poverty Implementation Group (“IG”) in 2021 with representation from most Government Departments. The IG meets 2-3 times yearly; its purpose is to implement the recommendations of the Discussion Paper. Its most recent meeting was in early June, 2025. Its purpose is to achieve cross sectoral input and to co-ordinate oversight of implementation measures recommended by the Period Poverty in Ireland Discussion Paper published in February 2021.  These recommendations were supported by Government and include the following priorities:  • Expanding access to free period products in public buildings and publicly funded services.• Partnering with services and NGOs to provide free period products to those in need.• Supporting the evidence base through further research.• Providing procurement supports.  The Implementation Group has been coordinating implementation across Government and enabling wider access to period products; significant developments include:  • The availability of free period products in most public facing bathrooms across the majority of Government Departments.  • The Hygiene Supplies and Period Equality Products Framework has been in place since June, 2023 and can be accessed by Government Departments, State Agencies and other public bodies through the Buyer Zone, Office of Government Procurement website. A wide variety of no-cost dispensers and re-usable and sustainable products are available through the Framework, in addition to traditional tampons and towels.  • A zero rate of VAT has been applied on newer forms of period products (mooncups, period panties, re-usable towels).  • Menstrual health and period poverty modules have been included in representative Surveys, supporting the evidence base.  • A number of other initiatives have been put in place by other Departments across Government.  In terms of period dignity measures put in place across the health sector and its partnerships, the Department of Health and HSE have been allocated funding for period poverty mitigation, totalling €914,000 in 2025. Annual funding has been in place since 2022 and grant schemes are now well established. The most urgent focus is on reaching those most in need (e.g., the homeless, those living with addiction, minorities including Traveller and Roma women, and those experiencing consistent poverty).  In terms of funding managed directly from the Department of Health, partnerships are in place, renewed annually, with local authorities, the Family Resource Centre National Forum and NGOs. The HSE National Social Inclusion Office is also supporting the 6 Health Regions to provide period dignity supports through their partnerships locally.  In 2025, the Department’s period dignity scheme has supported 24 Local Authorities. 10 NGOs and 46 Family Resource Centres through the FRC National Forum. Initiatives include supply of products through local authority buildings and facilities, family resource centres, community and charity partners, focus groups and local public awareness campaigns, and equipping publicly accessible, national and local government run buildings and facilities (e.g. libraries) with no-cost dispensers and free products in bathrooms.  In terms of expanding the evidence base, the 2022 Healthy Ireland Survey included a module on menstrual health and period poverty. The results indicated that 51% of women currently having periods had missed activities of daily living (e.g. school, college, work, sports, social activities) on occasion because of period symptoms, and that 24% had experienced period poverty.  Similarly, a shorter module on menstrual health and period poverty was included in the Health Behaviour in School-Aged Children Study, 2022, which found that 60% of girls old enough to have periods had missed school on occasion because of period symptoms and that 10% were impacted by period poverty.

The HSE Period Dignity site can be accessed here: www.hse.ie/eng/about/who/primarycare/socialinclusion/about-social-inclusion/news/hse-period-poverty-pilot.html.  The Women’s Health Fund was established in Budget 2021. This annual fund has supported a range of priority service areas for women, including support for additional period dignity funding in 2024 of approximately €80,000. The Programme for Government and Women's Health Action Plans commit to further developing the transformation in women’s health, which has included free contraception and HRT schemes. Both hormonal contraception and HRT can be used to manage period symptoms such as dysmenorrhoea, menorrhagia or pre-menstrual syndrome.  In collaboration with the Women’s Health Taskforce, I am committed to listening to and working for women in order to improve the health experiences and outcomes for women and girls in Ireland. ",

Issues surrounding security of medicines supply have been increasingly well characterised, both nationally and internationally, in recent years. The causes of such supply issues are multifaceted, ranging from pandemics, geopolitical events, perennial shortages of raw materials, manufacturing issues, quality issues, unexpected increased demand, commercial reasons, and distribution issues, such as those caused by geopolitical uncertainties. Currently, numerous shortage notifications lack specificity regarding the root cause.  In European legislation, marketing authorisation holders (the companies responsible for placing medicines on the market) are mandated to:  • provide continuous supply to a market that they serve and  • to notify national competent authorities where they expect there to be an interruption in supply.  There are several workstreams ongoing at a national and EU level to minimise the occurrence and mitigate the impact of shortages and to support increased supply chain transparency measures. Nationally, there is;  • Medicines Shortages Framework, operated by our medicines regulator, the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA), on behalf of the Department of Health, which aims to help prevent potential shortages from occurring and to reduce the impact of shortages on patients by coordinating the management of potential or actual shortages across the health service as they arise.  • Medicines Criticality Assessment Group, convened by the Department of Health and chaired by the Health Service Executive (HSE).  • Clinical guidance, where appropriate, issued by the HSE.  The HPRA hosts a list of current and resolved shortages on its website: www.hpra.ie/find-a-medicine/for-human-use/medicine-shortages?data=eyJpZCI6bnVsbCwic2tpcCI6MCwidGFrZSI6MTAsInF1ZXJ5IjpudWxsLCJvcmRlciI6Imxhc3R1cGRhdGVkIERFU0MiLCJmaWx0ZXIiOiJBbGwifQ%3D%3D. The webpage is updated daily as the HPRA receives new information. In the event that patients or their carers are unable to source a medicine, they are advised to discuss possible alternatives with their doctor pending the resumption of normal supply.  The HPRA is not currently aware of any supply issues with Somatuline products. The HPRA have reached out to the marketing authorisation holder for Somatuline products to confirm the supply situation.
