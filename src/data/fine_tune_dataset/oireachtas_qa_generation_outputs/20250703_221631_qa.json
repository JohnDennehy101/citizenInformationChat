It includes an Action Plan containing over 50 actions across five thematic strands, focusing on providing improved facilities, increasing access for people with disabilities, improving the culture of inclusion, better coaching supports, increasing safety awareness and providing a pathway that allows for the nurturing and development of potential high performers.  The public consultation that informed the development of the National Swimming Strategy suggested that existing swimming pool stock is insufficient and, as a result, a key focus of the Strategy is on providing improved facilities. There is a specific action in the strategy to complete an in-depth analysis of swimming pool provision within Ireland with particular reference to identifying gaps in provision. Swim Ireland, the National Governing Body for swimming, is currently undertaking an analysis of the type and nature of swimming pool ownership in the country and will publish a report in this regard in the coming period.  This report will be central to the future development of swimming pool facilities. Capital support for new swimming pools, and the refurbishment of existing pools, continues to be provided by my Department through the Large-Scale Sport Infrastructure Fund, which to date has allocated €28.9 million to 9 swimming pool projects.  The Strategy also endeavours to support additional opportunities for people to access lessons, to ensure optimal use of pool times for lessons and coaching, to address challenges in recruiting and retaining swimming instructors and to further embed the provision of aquatics and water safety as components of school curriculums.  In support of the Strategy, additional funding of €500,000 was provided to Swim Ireland in 2024 for the deployment of swimming activators to work within local authority areas, focusing on increasing participation amongst under-represented groups and improving coaching supports and facilities. This additional funding will also be provided in 2025 and 2026 – totalling €1.5 million over three years.  Responsibility for the delivery of the Strategy’s Action Plan is shared across Government Departments, State Agencies and other key stakeholders, including local authorities.

The Programme for Government commits to accelerating Ireland’s progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by 2030 and to adopting a coordinated approach to drive impactful action both at home and abroad. A whole-of-Government approach is being taken to deliver the SDGs in Ireland. My Department has overall responsibility for promoting the SDGs and overseeing delivery of the National Implementation Plan across Government. Other relevant Ministers have responsibility for achieving individual SDG targets related to their Ministerial functions.  Achieving the SDGs by 2030 is a collective task that cannot be accomplished without partnership. The third National Implementation Plan for the SDGs is in the early stages of development. A collaborative and participatory approach is being taken to develop the plan, which will involve multiple stakeholders, including Government, Local Authorities, non-governmental organisations, civil society, and various sectoral areas, such as business and academia, youth and marginalised groups. The consultation process will include a number of phases and different strands of consultation, both online and in-person, to reach this wide range of stakeholders.  To support a whole-of-Government approach, my Department will be engaging, through the relevant Senior Officials Group, the SDG Interdepartmental Working Group (IDWG) and other working groups, with officials from across Government Departments on the new Plan.  Ireland’s current participation in the multi-country OECD Project on Policy Coherence for Sustainable Development “Building Policy Coherence for Sustainable Development (PCSD) across national and local government in Ireland” is also helping to inform the new Plan. Workshops on PCSD with participants from across Government Departments and Civil Society took place in March. A capacity building workshop on localisation with the SDG Localisation working group took place in April, with a further workshop taking place this week with Local Authorities.  The SDG National Stakeholder Forum due to take place in September, will also be based around the new National Implementation Plan, and will form a further part of the public consultation.  The draft Implementation Plan, once developed and prior to Government approval and publication, will also be open for consultation for a final round of feedback. ",

As a commercial semi-state body, CIÉ are responsible for the provision of pension schemes for their employees - this is consistent with the pension arrangements of semi-state bodies.  That being said, I am acutely aware of concerns raised by the members of both CIÉ pension schemes, regarding the lack of pension increases since 2008, especially given the higher cost of living that many are facing.  On Thursday 15 May 2025, I was notified by CIÉ and the Trade Union Group that they have reached a negotiated position on a proposal relating to the issues associated with pension security for current employees at the CIÉ Group of Companies. The proposal also includes provision for long overdue pension in payment increases for ex-employees of the CIÉ Group.  I am advised a consultative process with all stakeholders will be conducted over the coming weeks, followed by ballot on the settlement proposal, which will be undertaken by the Trade Union Group.  I welcome the constructive engagement between unions and CIÉ management on this issue.

Deputy Michael Cahill asked the Minister for Transport if priority can be given to carrying out major upgrades and improvement works to the R571 road from Tuosist, County Kerry to Castletownbere in County Cork; and if he will make a statement on the matter. [35130/25]",
        "extracted_answer": "Minister for Transport  In accordance with the provisions of Section 13 of the Roads Act 1993, each local authority has statutory responsibility for the improvement and maintenance of their regional and local roads. Works on those roads are funded from local authorities' own resources and are supplemented by State Road grants. Of these grants, the vast majority (approximately 90%) are targeted at the maintenance and renewal of the network with c. 10% of the remaining funding invested in new roads/bridges or for road realignments.Any road improvement projects that seek State funding are assessed by the Department on a case-by-case basis. All projects proposed by local authorities for consideration must comply with the requirements of the Infrastructure Guidelines (formerly the Public Spending Code) and the Department's Transport Appraisal Framework. Given the limited funding available for regional and local road improvement works it is important for local authorities to prioritise projects within their overall area of responsibility with these requirements in mind.  According to my Department's records, an application was not received from Kerry or Cork County Council for funding for improvement works on the R571 road from Tuosist, County Kerry to Castletownbere in County Cork.",

I am aware that Go-Ahead experienced difficulties in maintaining service levels, particularly in the first quarter of this year, primarily due to a shortage of mechanics. In response, the company undertook a number of remedial actions, including flying in additional mechanics from its UK operations and securing further technical support from external sources.  I understand that the situation has since improved significantly, with fleet availability returning to normal within a relatively short period. Go-Ahead have reported that since January, 8 new engineering staff have joined the company and 129 drivers have started in the driving school. In addition, Go-Ahead have completed overseas recruitment with 10 engineers expected to start in September 2025.  The National Transport Authority monitors the performance of all public transport operators.

Despite recent operational challenges, the NTA is confident in Go-Ahead’s capacity and capability to effectively deliver services. Recent customer satisfaction surveys indicate that overall satisfaction with Go-Ahead’s services in Dublin remains strong, outperforming other large bus operators providing services on behalf of the NTA.

Housing policy is a priority matter for Government, led by the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage.Housing for All, Ireland's housing plan to 2030, contains a suite of actions that have and continue to increase the provision of housing through accelerating supply and increasing the affordability of homes.  Cost Rental housing is a new type of housing tenure introduced under Housing for All and is targeted at those people who do not qualify for social housing but who are facing affordability pressures on the private rental market. The Government recognises the urgent need for additional cost rental homes, and the need to ensure local key workers can avail of these homes, including teachers, for vital local services particularly in areas of high housing demand.  The Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2024 included new provisions related to the cost rental sector which are likely to improve access for certain cohorts, including those who may be categorised as key workers.

        "extracted_answer": "Minister for Education and Youth  Ensuring that every child's experience in school is positive and that they have qualified, engaged teachers available to support them in their learning is a priority area of action for the Government.  Housing policy is a priority matter for Government, led by the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage.Housing for All, Ireland's housing plan to 2030, contains a suite of actions that have and continue to increase the provision of housing through accelerating supply and increasing the affordability of homes.  Cost Rental housing is a new type of housing tenure introduced under Housing for All and is targeted at those people who do not qualify for social housing but who are facing affordability pressures on the private rental market. The Government recognises the urgent need for additional cost rental homes, and the need to ensure local key workers can avail of these homes, including teachers, for vital local services particularly in areas of high housing demand.  The Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2024 included new provisions related to the cost rental sector which are likely to improve access for certain cohorts, including those who may be categorised as key workers. The changes will mean that amongst other things cost rental providers may prioritise homes for those with a link to an area though previous residence, place of employment, or children’s education. This will support people to live and work in their local area.

The report on the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs (EPSEN) Act 2004 has been finalised and is available at the following link www.gov.ie/en/department-of-education/consultations/epsen-review-consultation/  This review represents a significant step in aligning education policy and legislation with the lived experiences of children and young people with special educational needs, with the goal of improving educational outcomes.  The following outlines the background of the EPSEN Act 2004 Review and the key recommendations resulting from it.  The Department of Education and Youth's policy, which is set out in the EPSEN Act 2004, is that children with special educational needs should be educated in mainstream placements with additional supports provided as appropriate. The majority of children with special educational needs are supported in this way.  In December 2021, a comprehensive review of the EPSEN Act was announced. It received over 28,000 responses to online surveys, including 900 from children and young people through an accessible format. Additionally, 91 adults and 94 young people from mainstream, special, and Irish-medium schools, including some who had left school, took part in focus groups.  The review highlighted multiple areas where changes to legislation, policy, or practice are considered necessary. The final report outlines fifty one recommendations across sixteen key themes. These include a proposal to bring all school-age children under a single legislative framework to ensure a legal, rights-based approach to inclusive education. Another key recommendation is the completion of the roadmap towards a proactive, inclusive education system that supports transitions from early years through post-primary and beyond.  The report also calls for Student Support Plans to be given statutory status to ensure consistency in meeting individual needs, and for a review of language used in relation to additional needs to reflect inclusivity.  It reaffirms the importance of recognising children’s rights, ensuring meaningful parental involvement, and fostering stronger collaboration between government departments. It also highlights the need for continued investment in professional development for educators.  The Assessment of Need process emerged as a key concern across submissions, with many stakeholders calling for improved efficiency and timeliness. Work is already underway across government, including collaboration between the Department of Education and Youth and the Department of Children, Disability and Equality, to address this  An implementation plan will be published before the end of the year to guide the next steps.

        "answerText": " Minister for Education and Youth  I can assure the Deputy that the provision of school places to meet the needs of children and young people at primary and post primary level, including children and young people with special educational needs is an absolute priority for the Department of Education.  In order to plan for school provision and analyse the relevant demographic data, my department divides the country into 314 school planning areas and uses a geographical information system, using data from a range of sources, including CSO census data, child benefit and school enrolment data, to identify where the pressure for school places across the country will arise and where additional school accommodation is needed at primary and post-primary level.  Major new residential developments have the potential to alter the demand for school places at a local level. In that regard, as part of the demographic demand analysis, my department monitors planning and construction activity in the residential sector. This involves the analysis of data sources from local authorities and the CSO along with the engagement with local authorities and the construction sector. In this way, up-to-date information on significant new residential developments is obtained and factored into the demographic analysis exercise. This is necessary to ensure that schools infrastructure planning is keeping pace with demographic changes, at a local level, where there is a constantly evolving picture with planned new residential development.  While the Department is aware of enrolment pressures and demand for additional school places in some areas, it is important to note that where enrolment pressures arise, it may not be as a result of lack of accommodation but may be driven by the following factors:  • Duplication of applications  • School of choice  • Single sex schools  • External draw  Notwithstanding the above, in some areas demographic pressures and other factors are driving a requirement for additional school places.  Where demographic data indicates that additional provision is required, the delivery of such additional capacity is dependent on the particular circumstances of each case and may, be provided through:  • Utilising existing unused capacity within a school or schools  • Extending the capacity of a school or schools  • Provision of a new school or schools  There are a number of active projects at primary level in progress in the Donabate school planning area which will provide additional capacity. These projects include new school building project for Gaelscoil na Mara to provide 16 mainstream classrooms and 4 Special education classroom school. In addition, there is an extension project active for S N C Naomh Padraig at Stage 1.  The Capital Programme details the school projects that are being progressed under Project Ireland 2040. The current status of large-scale projects being delivered under Project Ireland 2040, may be viewed on the Department's website at, www.gov.ie and this information is updated regularly. In addition, a list of large-scale projects completed from 2010 to date may also be viewed on the website.  The Department's main responsibility is to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all pupils seeking school places in the area. In relation to school admissions, it is the responsibility of the managerial authorities of all schools to implement an enrolment policy in accordance with the Education Act, 1998.  Parents have the right to choose which school to apply to and where the school has places available the pupil should be admitted. However, in schools where there are more applicants than places available, a selection process may be necessary. This selection process and the enrolment policy on which it is based must be non-discriminatory and must be applied fairly in respect of all applicants. However, this may result in some pupils not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice.  The Educational Welfare Services of the Child and Family Agency, Tusla, is the statutory agency that can assist parents who are experiencing difficulty in securing a school place for their child. The local service is delivered through the national network of Educational Welfare Officers. Contact details are available on Tusla’s website.  The Department will continue to keep the school place requirements in the Donabate school planning area, as with other areas across the country, under review. ",

        "answerText": " Minister of State at the Department of Education and Youth  The government is committed to the provision of additional special school places for children with more complex educational needs. Over 300 new special school places are being provided for the coming 2025/26 school year. Five new special schools are being established in addition to the eleven new special schools opened over the last few years. Special school capacity is also being expanded across a number of special schools.  As recently announced, my department will begin examining the designation of special schools in the 2025/26 school year. It’s important to note that it is not the intention to exclude children who require a special school place from accessing certain special school settings, but rather allow children with complex educational needs apply to their local special school by broadening the designation of more schools.  Currently, there are instances whereby children with complex needs cannot apply for admission to their local special school simply because they don’t meet the narrow designation of that special school. In that regard, along with providing additional special school capacity, my department and the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) consider it necessary to look at the profile of our existing special schools.  This is not a new departure. The NCSE report that over half of mild general learning disability (MGLD) special schools have already changed their policies in order to allow children with more complex needs in their communities who require a special school setting enrol in their local special school. I wish to thank schools who have worked with us to broaden their designation. My department will now engage with and support the remaining schools to embrace this endeavour so that more special schools can better support children with complex needs in their local community.  There are approximately 30 of our 129 special schools that were originally designated as schools for children with a MGLD. The establishment of these special schools predated the significant expansion in the range of supports offered in mainstream schools through additional special education teaching and special needs assistant resources and through the rapid expansion in special class provision.  It is noted that many of the children enrolling in MGLD special school do so around the transition point from primary to post-primary. The new senior cycle level 1 and level 2 programmes offers a new curriculum pathway for students with special educational needs at post-primary level now also. ",

        "extracted_question": "227. Deputy Shónagh Ní Raghallaigh asked the Minister for Education and Youth her Department's official policy position with respect to the redesignation of mild special schools; if it is the Department's intention to redesignate all mild special schools and the timeline for same; to list all redesignations sanctioned to date and planned redesignations; the evidence base and policy rationale for the same; and if she will make a statement on the relevance of continued specialised provision of education catering to learners with mild general learning disability. [35038/25]",
        "extracted_answer": "Minister of State at the Department of Education and Youth  The government is committed to the provision of additional special school places for children with more complex educational needs. Over 300 new special school places are being provided for the coming 2025/26 school year. Five new special schools are being established in addition to the eleven new special schools opened over the last few years. Special school capacity is also being expanded across a number of special schools.  As recently announced, my department will begin examining the designation of special schools in the 2025/26 school year. It’s important to note that it is not the intention to exclude children who require a special school place from accessing certain special school settings, but rather allow children with complex educational needs apply to their local special school by broadening the designation of more schools.  Currently, there are instances whereby children with complex needs cannot apply for admission to their local special school simply because they don’t meet the narrow designation of that special school. In that regard, along with providing additional special school capacity, my department and the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) consider it necessary to look at the profile of our existing special schools.  This is not a new departure. The NCSE report that over half of mild general learning disability (MGLD) special schools have already changed their policies in order to allow children with more complex needs in their communities who require a special school setting enrol in their local special school. I wish to thank schools who have worked with us to broaden their designation. My department will now engage with and support the remaining schools to embrace this endeavour so that more special schools can better support children with complex needs in their local community.  There are approximately 30 of our 129 special schools that were originally designated as schools for children with a MGLD. The establishment of these special schools predated the significant expansion in the range of supports offered in mainstream schools through additional special education teaching and special needs assistant resources and through the rapid expansion in special class provision.  It is noted that many of the children enrolling in MGLD special school do so around the transition point from primary to post-primary. The new senior cycle level 1 and level 2 programmes offers a new curriculum pathway for students with special educational needs at post-primary level now also.",
        "formatted_question": "What is the Department's policy on redesignating mild special schools? Will all such schools be redesigned, and if so, by when? Provide a list of schools already redesigned and those planned for redesignation. What evidence and rationale support this policy? Will the Department issue a statement on the importance of specialized education for students with mild general learning disabilities?",
        "formatted_answer": "The Department aims to increase special school places, with 300 new places and five new schools planned for 2025/26. Designation reviews will begin in 2025/26 to broaden access for children with complex needs. Currently, some schools have narrow designations limiting access. Over half of the 30 mild general learning disability schools have adjusted their policies. These schools were established before expanded mainstream supports. Many students enter these schools during the transition from primary to post-primary education. New senior cycle programs are available for students with special needs."

        "answerText": " Minister for Education and Youth  My Department uses a range of data sources when analysing the demand for school places, including enrolment data, child benefit data, census data, Local Authority population & housing projections and data on residential construction activity.  As the Deputy may be aware, the annual enrolment process for new Junior Infants at primary and new First Years at post-primary is a very large-scale operation that is transacted at close to 4,000 schools across the country, involving some 140,000 pupils. While there can be enrolment pressures and demand for additional school places in some areas, it is important to note sometimes this may not be as a result of lack of accommodation. Enrolment pressures can be driven by duplications of applications, applications from outside an area, and school of choice factors.  Under the Education (Admission to Schools) Act 2018, parents have the right to choose which school to apply to and where the school has places available the pupil should be admitted. However, in schools where there are more applicants than places available, a selection process will be necessary. This selection process and the enrolment policy on which it is based must be non-discriminatory and must be applied fairly in respect of all applicants. However, this may result in some pupils not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice.  The Act requires schools to clearly set out their selection criteria in their admission policies. Schools have discretion in relation to their admission criteria and how they are applied. The criteria to be applied by schools and the order of priority are a matter for the schools themselves.  With respect to post primary school places in Mallow, there are significantly more first year places available for 2025/26 than there are sixth class children in primary school across the wider area. According to data provided to my Department, while there are a number of boys remaining on the waiting list for Patrician Academy, the majority of these children have accepted a place at another school. Parents/guardians of a small number of boys who remain on the waiting list for Patrician Academy appear to have only applied for admission to that school.

        "formatted_answer": "The government uses data sources including enrolment, child benefit, census, and housing projections to assess school place demand. The enrolment process involves 4,000 schools and 140,000 pupils annually. Enrolment pressures can result from application duplication, out-of-area applications, and school choice preferences. Parents can choose schools, but if demand exceeds places, a non-discriminatory selection process is used. For post-primary education in Mallow, there are more first-year places than sixth-class students. Some boys remain on Patrician Academy's waiting list, but most have accepted places elsewhere. Parents are advised to apply to Davis College for remaining spots."

Over 300 new special school places are being provided for the coming 2025/26 school year. Five new special schools are being established in addition to the eleven new special schools opened over the last few years. Special school capacity is also being expanded across a number of special schools.  As recently announced, my department will begin examining the designation of special schools in the 2025/26 school year. It’s important to note that it is not the intention to exclude children who require a special school place from accessing certain special school settings, but rather allow children with complex educational needs apply to their local special school by broadening the designation of more schools. It is also important to state that this is not an attempt to create what the Deputy describes as \"catch all special schools\", which is an unfair description for schools which have already been through this process.  Currently, there are instances whereby children with complex needs cannot apply for admission to their local special school simply because they don’t meet the narrow designation of that special school. In that regard, along with providing additional special school capacity, my department and the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) consider it necessary to look at the profile of our existing special schools.  This is not a new departure. The NCSE report that over half of mild general learning disability (MGLD) special schools have already changed their policies in order to allow children with more complex needs in their communities who require a special school setting enrol in their local special school. I wish to thank schools who have worked with us to broaden their designation. My department will now engage with and support the remaining schools to embrace this endeavour so that more special schools can better support children with complex needs in their local community. Importantly no child currently enrolled in a MGLD school will be affected by a school predesignating.  There are approximately 30 of our 129 special schools that were originally designated as schools for children with a MGLD. The establishment of these special schools predated the significant expansion in the range of supports offered in mainstream schools through additional special education teaching and special needs assistant resources and through the rapid expansion in special class provision.  It is noted that many of the children enrolling in MGLD special school do so around the transition point from primary to post-primary.

Deputy Shónagh Ní Raghallaigh asked the Minister for Education and Youth to outline, under her plans to redesignate mild special school as catch all special schools, the specific resources and training that will be provided to mainstream teachers to effectively accommodate mild students in mainstream before 2026-2027. [35081/25]",
        "extracted_answer": "Minister of State at the Department of Education  I propose to take Questions Nos. 235, 236, 238, 239 and 240 together.  The government is committed to the provision of additional special school places for children with more complex educational needs. Over 300 new special school places are being provided for the coming 2025/26 school year. Five new special schools are being established in addition to the eleven new special schools opened over the last few years. Special school capacity is also being expanded across a number of special schools.  As recently announced, my department will begin examining the designation of special schools in the 2025/26 school year. It’s important to note that it is not the intention to exclude children who require a special school place from accessing certain special school settings, but rather allow children with complex educational needs apply to their local special school by broadening the designation of more schools. It is also important to state that this is not an attempt to create what the Deputy describes as \"catch all special schools\", which is an unfair description for schools which have already been through this process.  Currently, there are instances whereby children with complex needs cannot apply for admission to their local special school simply because they don’t meet the narrow designation of that special school. In that regard, along with providing additional special school capacity, my department and the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) consider it necessary to look at the profile of our existing special schools.  This is not a new departure. The NCSE report that over half of mild general learning disability (MGLD) special schools have already changed their policies in order to allow children with more complex needs in their communities who require a special school setting enrol in their local special school. I wish to thank schools who have worked with us to broaden their designation. My department will now engage with and support the remaining schools to embrace this endeavour so that more special schools can better support children with complex needs in their local community. Importantly no child currently enrolled in a MGLD school will be affected by a school predesignating.  There are approximately 30 of our 129 special schools that were originally designated as schools for children with a MGLD. The establishment of these special schools predated the significant expansion in the range of supports offered in mainstream schools through additional special education teaching and special needs assistant resources and through the rapid expansion in special class provision.  It is noted that many of the children enrolling in MGLD special school do so around the transition point from primary to post-primary. The new senior cycle level 1 and level 2 programmes offers a new curriculum pathway for students with special educational needs at post-primary level now also.",

        "answerText": " Minister for Education and Youth  I am pleased to advise the Deputy that the school in question currently has a project at stage 4 under my department's Additional Schools' Accommodation (ASA) scheme.  This project will provide the school with three new science laboratories, two prep areas and a new design and communications (DCG) room as well as two mainstream classrooms by way of refurbishment of existing accommodation.  The purpose of my department’s ASA scheme is to ensure that essential mainstream classroom accommodation and accommodation for pupils with special education needs is available to cater for pupils enrolled each year, where the need cannot be met by the school’s existing accommodation or at other schools in the area. A request for a PE Hall does not come within the remit of the ASA scheme.  Investment and expenditure on PE Halls is an element of the overall School Building Programme. The provision of GP rooms and PE Halls, at primary and post primary level respectively, and outdoor hard play areas, form part of the accommodation brief for all new school buildings. This is also the case where a major building or refurbishment project is being delivered for an existing school as part of the department’s large-scale building programme.  Almost 95% of the post primary schools that made 2020 Annual Schools Returns have indicated to my department that they either have a PE Hall, access to a nearby PE Hall, or a project in train that will deliver a new PE Hall. Practically all schools have outdoor play areas and many schools use adjacent local facilities, including community halls, public parks, playing fields and swimming pools.  Since 2020, my department has invested over €6 billion in our schools throughout the country under the National Development Plan, involving the completion of over 1,400 school building projects and with construction currently underway in over 325 other projects, which includes new school buildings some of which are being delivered in phases.  These 325 projects currently at construction involve a total State investment of over €1.7bn. This is a record level of investment in our schools and highlights the Government’s very strong track record of delivery in providing additional capacity and modern facilities for our school communities.  A future strengthened focus on refurbishment of existing school stock will have different strands and will include a PE build and modernisation programme which will enable students in post-primary schools to have access to appropriate facilities to support PE provision, particularly also in the context of the roll-out of PE as a leaving-certificate subject. Enhanced and modernised PE facilities will also provide important amenities for local communities.  However, the main focus of my department’s capital funding over the last decade and for the coming period is on provision of critical additional capacity to cater for increasing demographics and children with special education needs.  My department is required to manage the overall school building programme so that we target and prioritise areas that are under greatest pressure for additional school places. This reflects my department’s fundamental objective of ensuring the availability of a school place for every child.  The overall position with regard to potential modernisation and replacement of existing school infrastructure will be kept under review as capital funding allocations for future years are clarified.  The Department of Public Expenditure, NDP Delivery and Reform will be engaging with all Department's on NDP allocations for the period 2026 to 2028 over the coming months. ",

This is also the case where a major building or refurbishment project is being delivered for an existing school as part of the department’s large-scale building programme.  Almost 95% of the post primary schools that made 2020 Annual Schools Returns have indicated to my department that they either have a PE Hall, access to a nearby PE Hall, or a project in train that will deliver a new PE Hall. Practically all schools have outdoor play areas and many schools use adjacent local facilities, including community halls, public parks, playing fields and swimming pools.  Since 2020, my department has invested over €6 billion in our schools throughout the country under the National Development Plan, involving the completion of over 1,400 school building projects and with construction currently underway in over 325 other projects, which includes new school buildings some of which are being delivered in phases.  These 325 projects currently at construction involve a total State investment of over €1.7bn. This is a record level of investment in our schools and highlights the Government’s very strong track record of delivery in providing additional capacity and modern facilities for our school communities.  A future strengthened focus on refurbishment of existing school stock will have different strands and will include a PE build and modernisation programme which will enable students in post-primary schools to have access to appropriate facilities to support PE provision, particularly also in the context of the roll-out of PE as a leaving-certificate subject. Enhanced and modernised PE facilities will also provide important amenities for local communities.  However, the main focus of my department’s capital funding over the last decade and for the coming period is on provision of critical additional capacity to cater for increasing demographics and children with special education needs.  My department is required to manage the overall school building programme so that we target and prioritise areas that are under greatest pressure for additional school places. This reflects my department’s fundamental objective of ensuring the availability of a school place for every child.  The overall position with regard to potential modernisation and replacement of existing school infrastructure will be kept under review as capital funding allocations for future years are clarified.  The Department of Public Expenditure, NDP Delivery and Reform will be engaging with all Department's on NDP allocations for the period 2026 to 2028 over the coming months.",
        "formatted_question": "A request was made to the Education Department to construct a sports hall for a school, as it is the sole institution without such facilities in the county.",
        "formatted_answer": "The school in question has a project under the Additional Schools' Accommodation (ASA) scheme, which includes new science laboratories, preparation areas, and a design and communications room, along with refurbished classrooms. The ASA scheme focuses on essential classroom and special education needs, excluding physical education halls. PE halls are part of the broader School Building Programme. As of 2020, 95% of post-primary schools either have a PE hall, are in the process of obtaining one, or have access to nearby facilities. Most schools have outdoor play areas and utilize community resources. Since 2020, over €6 billion has been invested in 1,400 school projects, with 325 ongoing projects valued at €1.7 billion. A future plan includes a PE facility program, though the primary focus remains on expanding school capacity. The Department will review modernization efforts as funding allocations are determined."

It provides a balanced range of activities for children through the six strands: Athletics; Dance; Gymnastics; Games; Outdoor and Adventure Activities; and Aquatics.  The PE curriculum contributes to children’s overall development by helping them to lead full, active and healthy lives. It provides a balanced range of activities for children through Aquatics strand of PE. The aquatics programme is concerned with gaining competence and confidence near, in, under and on water. The term ‘aquatics’ is used to include not only the teaching of swimming strokes but the provision of opportunities for enjoyment of water play and other aspects of aquatics. The concern for water safety permeates all aquatic activities.  However, the PE curriculum has been developed on the understanding that facilities available to schools vary. Consequently, it offers a level of flexibility that allows each individual school to design a programme that can be delivered using the resources and supports available to it.

        "answerText": " Minister for Education and Youth  At Junior Cycle all students undertaking a level 3 programme study a Physical Education specification designed for 135 hours engagement over the three years of Junior Cycle. The course offers a level of flexibility that allows each individual school to design a programme that can be delivered using the resources and supports available to it. Aquatics is one of the physical activities included in the specification, which are the instrumental medium for students to achieve learning outcomes. One of these outcomes is that students should be able to: “Demonstrate an understanding of personal survival and water safety considerations”.  It is worth noting that other short courses can also be developed by schools themselves or by other bodies, using a template provided by the NCCA. It is therefore open to a school or other body to develop a targeted short course in Aquatics for use in schools. Further details on how to develop a short course for Junior Cycle can be accessed at the following link: www.juniorcycle.ie/Planning/Short-Course-Development  In the Leaving Certificate Physical Education specification, learners’ physically active participation is central to teaching and learning. To enable this to happen, students learn about the different theoretical perspectives through their participation in three different physical activities. These activities are selected from six distinct physical activity areas which reflect the activities more commonly included in school physical education programmes currently. In the Physical Activity area, Aquatics students learn about water-based activities that utilise swimming and/or diving skills and techniques for performance water safety, or recreational purposes. Learners may choose one of the following activities: lifesaving, survival swimming, swimming strokes, water-polo, synchronised swimming.  The Physical Education curricula at both primary and post-primary level have been developed on the understanding that facilities available to schools vary. Consequently, they offer a level of flexibility that allows each individual school to design a programme that can be delivered using the resources and supports available to it. However, it is recognised that the particular context of the school, the physical education programme it can facilitate and the level of community facilities will have a bearing on the level of choice that can be managed. The physical education teacher, in consultation with the learners, will agree the range of activities that can be accommodated and supported for Physical Education. In relation to physical education facilities, many schools have PE halls and practically all schools have outdoor play areas. In addition, many schools use adjacent local facilities, including community halls, public parks, playing fields and swimming pools. Access to these facilities is arranged directly by schools and the Department is not involved in these arrangements. ",

        "extracted_answer": "Minister for Education and Youth  At Junior Cycle all students undertaking a level 3 programme study a Physical Education specification designed for 135 hours engagement over the three years of Junior Cycle. The course offers a level of flexibility that allows each individual school to design a programme that can be delivered using the resources and supports available to it. Aquatics is one of the physical activities included in the specification, which are the instrumental medium for students to achieve learning outcomes. One of these outcomes is that students should be able to: “Demonstrate an understanding of personal survival and water safety considerations”.  It is worth noting that other short courses can also be developed by schools themselves or by other bodies, using a template provided by the NCCA. It is therefore open to a school or other body to develop a targeted short course in Aquatics for use in schools. Further details on how to develop a short course for Junior Cycle can be accessed at the following link: www.juniorcycle.ie/Planning/Short-Course-Development  In the Leaving Certificate Physical Education specification, learners’ physically active participation is central to teaching and learning. To enable this to happen, students learn about the different theoretical perspectives through their participation in three different physical activities. These activities are selected from six distinct physical activity areas which reflect the activities more commonly included in school physical education programmes currently. In the Physical Activity area, Aquatics students learn about water-based activities that utilise swimming and/or diving skills and techniques for performance water safety, or recreational purposes.

        "formatted_question": "What supports are provided to secondary schools to offer swimming lessons?",
        "formatted_answer": "Secondary schools are supported through the Physical Education curriculum, which includes swimming as an activity. At the Junior Cycle level, students engage in 135 hours of Physical Education, with a focus on water safety. Schools can develop their own short courses using templates provided by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA). For the Leaving Certificate, students participate in three physical activities, including swimming options like strokes and lifesaving. The curriculum is flexible to accommodate varying school facilities, and schools utilize local resources such as swimming pools without Departmental involvement in arranging access."

However, I am committed to ensuring that this work does commence in the coming period.  It is important to ensure that any initiative provides access opportunities for all young people and represents an effective and efficient use of resources. With advice from my Department, other relevant departments, the National Cultural Institutions, and stakeholders in the arts sector, The participation of young people is crucial to fostering creativity and advancing the arts throughout Ireland. The introduction of a Culture Card could contribute significantly to this goal.  Research regarding arts and cultural participation among children confirms the benefits to children when they engage in the arts in their early years, and also indicates that patterns of participation in the arts are set from a very young age.

Through a cross-government partnership between this Department, the Department of Education, the Department of Children Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth Affairs, the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science and the Arts Council, a combined inter-departmental budget allocation of over €10 million in 2025, including an allocation through the Government’s Shared Island initiative, will provide creative opportunities for 0-24 year olds. With a particular focus on ensuring access for children and young people that are seldom heard and at risk of disadvantage, programmes include Local Creative Youth Partnerships (LCYPs). There are currently LCYPs based in 7 Education and Training Boards across the country. They aim to provide out-of-school creative and cultural activities for young people by bringing together the whole local infrastructure. The target audience for all LCYP programmes are children and young people in local communities (within the ETB’s geographical remit) in ‘out of school’ settings with a particular focus on previously less served cohorts.

The Creative Youth Nurture Fund awarded 9 projects over €700,000 in 2023, and this is running until 2025, to engage with specific cohorts of seldom heard children and young people in a creative experience in which their voice is central.

Post-primary schools and Youthreach Centres engage in Creative Youth programmes such as Creative Schools, Creative Clusters, Creative Engagement and BLAST, bringing enhanced access to arts, culture and creativity in education.  In addition to the allocation above, the Creative Youth Plan 2023-2027 also supports, through funding from the Department of Education, Music Generation’s National Music Education Programme which has been allocated €6.9 million in 2025.  My Department also supports several programmes and initiatives through the National Cultural Institution.

The Programme for Government commits to assessing the Basic Income for the Arts pilot research scheme to maximise its impact. I appreciate the importance of the Basic Income support for artists, which is why last week I announced that Cabinet had agreed to my proposal to an extension of six months to allow for further evaluation of the pilot data. This will also give sufficient time to engage in stakeholder consultation and to evaluate the data which will provide the evidence base for Government to make decisions on the next steps.  The primary objective of the scheme is to help artists deal with precarious incomes and to prevent talent from leaving the sector for economic reasons.  My Department has been undertaking a comprehensive research programme based on this data and is currently preparing a report examining the first 24 months of the scheme. I also recently published a paper which collects the experiences of BIA recipients, who were interviewed by a sociologist. A cost-benefit analysis paper is also being prepared. It will compare the benefits and costs arising from the BIA in order to determine its net value.  While the research phase of the pilot scheme is still ongoing, it is clear from evidence collected to date under the scheme that it is having a positive impact on participants. This data shows that the BIA payment is having a consistent, positive impact across almost all indicators - affecting practice development, sectoral retention, well-being, and deprivation.  Artists in receipt of the support are typically able to devote more time to their art, produce more pieces of work, experience a boost to their well-being through greater life satisfaction and reduced anxiety, and are protected from the precariousness of incomes in the sector to a greater degree than those who are not receiving the support.  I know that the BIA support is hugely valued by artists in receipt of it, it has also been the subject of much positive commentary at home and in an international context and makes an important statement about the value placed on the arts in Ireland.  A Government decision will be required on a successor scheme to the pilot, and I intend to bring forward proposals for a permanent intervention in the context of Budget 2026 discussions, based on the evidence arising from the research programme and stakeholder engagement.

        "extracted_answer": "Minister for Culture, Communications and Sport (Deputy Patrick O'Donovan)  I propose to take Questions Nos. 250 and 251 together.  The Programme for Government commits to assessing the Basic Income for the Arts pilot research scheme to maximise its impact. I appreciate the importance of the Basic Income support for artists, which is why last week I announced that Cabinet had agreed to my proposal to an extension of six months to allow for further evaluation of the pilot data. This will also give sufficient time to engage in stakeholder consultation and to evaluate the data which will provide the evidence base for Government to make decisions on the next steps.  The primary objective of the scheme is to help artists deal with precarious incomes and to prevent talent from leaving the sector for economic reasons.  My Department has been undertaking a comprehensive research programme based on this data and is currently preparing a report examining the first 24 months of the scheme. I also recently published a paper which collects the experiences of BIA recipients, who were interviewed by a sociologist. A cost-benefit analysis paper is also being prepared. It will compare the benefits and costs arising from the BIA in order to determine its net value.  While the research phase of the pilot scheme is still ongoing, it is clear from evidence collected to date under the scheme that it is having a positive impact on participants. This data shows that the BIA payment is having a consistent, positive impact across almost all indicators - affecting practice development, sectoral retention, well-being, and deprivation.  Artists in receipt of the support are typically able to devote more time to their art, produce more pieces of work, experience a boost to their well-being through greater life satisfaction and reduced anxiety, and are protected from the precariousness of incomes in the sector to a greater degree than those who are not receiving the support.  I know that the BIA support is hugely valued by artists in receipt of it, it has also been the subject of much positive commentary at home and in an international context and makes an important statement about the value placed on the arts in Ireland.  A Government decision will be required on a successor scheme to the pilot, and I intend to bring forward proposals for a permanent intervention in the context of Budget 2026 discussions, based on the evidence arising from the research programme and stakeholder engagement.",
        "formatted_question": "A request was made to consider increasing the weekly payment for the basic income for the arts pilot, as it is currently below the minimum wage. Additionally, the requestor asked if a statement on the matter would be provided.",
        "formatted_answer": "The basic income for the arts pilot was extended by six months to allow for further evaluation and stakeholder consultation. A report on the first 24 months of the scheme is being prepared. A paper detailing the experiences of participants has been published, and a cost-benefit analysis is underway. Data indicates positive impacts on artistic practice, sectoral retention, well-being, and reduced deprivation. Participants report spending more time on their work, increased productivity, improved well-being, and greater protection from income instability. The scheme has received positive international recognition. Plans are in place to propose a permanent solution during Budget 2026 discussions."

This includes exemptions for modular housing structures in gardens and the associated use of such structures. Any update to Exempted Development Regulations will require positive resolutions by both Houses of the Oireachtas before it can be signed into law.  With regard to Short Term Letting, the EU Short Term Rental (STR) Regulation was adopted by the EU on 11 April 2024 and is applicable from 20 May 2026. This Regulation lays down harmonised rules on the collection and exchange of data on short term rental services for member states, hosts providing short term accommodation rental services, and online platforms that offer services to hosts providing short term accommodation rental services within the EU.  The Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media (DTCAGSM) has drafted the Short Term Letting and Tourism (STLT) Bill General Scheme in full alignment with the STR Regulation. The introduction of the STLT Bill will provide a more effective legal and administrative basis to regulate short term lettings. This Bill when enacted will provide the statutory basis for the introduction of a register for all Short Term Lettings in Ireland, which will be implemented and managed by Fáilte Ireland from 20 May 2026.  The Government has recently agreed a policy to generally preclude new planning permissions for short term letting in cities and towns with a Census population in excess of 10,000 persons, at the most recent Census of Population. It was further agreed that local authorities should have discretion to develop policies for other locations having regard to relevant local criteria to be set out in the guidance. This guidance will be introduced in the form of a National Planning Statement (NPS).  My Department is currently developing a NPS for the short term letting sector to supplement and support the introduction of the STLT Bill. It will consider a variety of factors, such as existing planning legislation, the long term housing need in the local authority area, the location of the proposed short term let and balancing housing need with the potential impact on tourism and economic development.  My Department has met with various stakeholders such as booking platforms and industry representatives and will continue to do so during the development of the NPS for the short-term letting sector.

        "answerText": " Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage (Deputy James Browne)  I propose to take Questions Nos. 257, 261, 262 and 264 together.  The Residential Tenancies Acts 2004-2025 (the RTA) regulate the landlord-tenant relationship in the private rented sector and sets out the rights and obligations of landlords and tenants. The RTA apply to every dwelling that is the subject of a tenancy, subject to a limited number of exceptions. Section 3(2) of the RTA prescribes the dwellings to which that Act does not apply including a dwelling let to a person whose entitlement to occupation is for the purpose of a holiday only and a dwelling within which the landlord also resides.  Where a dwelling is occupied by a person under an arrangement or agreement which is not a tenancy covered by the RTA, for example, where a bona fide licensing arrangement exists, the RTB does not have any jurisdiction or function. It is a private contractual matter between the parties as to type of agreement/arrangement to put in place. If a dispute arises as to whether a purported license is in fact a tenancy, the RTB can determine on the matter and if it is a tenancy, the RTA applies.  Under section 3A of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended, \"the Minister may make regulations requiring such persons as are specified in the regulations to provide a planning authority with such information as may be so specified and at such intervals as may be so specified in relation to short term lettings in the administrative area of the planning authority\". Legislative reforms to regulate the short term letting sector - as provided for in the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2019 and supplementary regulations (Planning and Development Act 2000 (Exempted Development) (No. 2) Regulations 2019) came into effect on 1 July 2019. The provisions of the Regulations include the following:  • Short term letting is defined as the letting of a house or apartment, or part of a house or apartment, for any period not exceeding 14 days;  • Where a person owns a property in a Rent Pressure Zone which is not their principal private residence and intends to let it for short-term letting purposes, s/he is required to apply for a change of use planning permission unless the property already has a specific planning permission to be used for tourism or short-term letting purposes.  A person engaged in short-term letting of part of their principal private residence (PPR) does not generally require planning permission to do so. Short term letting of an entire PPR does require planning permission where such letting occurs for a total of more than 90 days per year. Such letting must not contravene any planning condition and must be consistent with any use, specified in the original planning permission.  The primary objective of that legislation is to regulate short-term letting through the planning code in the context of its impact on the supply of private rented accommodation. Responsibility for the implementation and enforcement of planning legislation is a matter for planning authorities.  It is important that there is a clear view, both at national level and local authority level, as to the overall policy approach to determining planning applications for Short Term Lets.  The Government has recently agreed a policy to generally preclude new planning permissions for Short term letting in cities and towns with a Census population in excess of 10,000 persons, at the most recent Census of Population. It was further agreed that local authorities should have discretion to develop policies for other locations having regard to relevant local criteria to be set out in the guidance. This guidance will be introduced in the form of a National Planning Statement (NPS).  My Department is currently developing a NPS for the Short-Term Letting sector to supplement and support the introduction of the Short-Term Letting and Tourism (STLT) Bill. It will consider a variety of factors, such as existing planning legislation, the long-term housing need in the local authority area, the location of the proposed Short-Term Let and balancing housing need with the potential impact on tourism and economic development.  Further to a review of the current provisions as operated by local authorities under the planning code, the Government agreed a specific action in Housing for All (action 20.4) to “develop new regulatory controls requiring short-term and holiday lets to register with Fáilte Ireland.” The General Scheme of the Short-Term Letting and Tourism Bill was submitted to Government by the Minister for Enterprise, Tourism and Employment in April 2025 and approved for priority legal drafting - https://enterprise.gov.ie/en/legislation/general-scheme-short-term-letting-and-tourism-bill-2025.html. The Bill will provide for new regulatory controls requiring short-term and holiday lets to register with Fáilte Ireland with a view to ensuring that houses are used to best effect in areas of housing need. Additionally, the Bill will provide for implementing measures necessary to give effect to the Short-Term Rental Regulation (EU) 2024/1028.  On 10 June 2025, the Government approved policy measures to provide for: the enhancement to rent controls and tenancy protections for new tenancies created (i.e. first time tenancy between parties) from 1 March 2026; and as an interim measure, to draft legislation on the basis of Heads provided to it to extend and expand the operation of Rent Pressure Zones (RPZs) across the entire country until 28 February 2026.  The new measures have been informed by the findings of the Housing Agency Review of Rent Pressure Zones and Potential Policy Options and its preferred recommendation to modify the existing operation of the current RPZ rent controls. On 17 June 2025, the Government approved the publication of the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Bill 2025 for priority enactment.  The Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2025 came into operation on 20 June 2025 and provides for a two-month extension, until 28 February 2026, of the operation of all existing RPZs and the deeming of other areas, not currently designated as RPZs, to become RPZs from 20 June 2025 until 28 February 2026.

Partial use of a principal private residence (PPR) doesn't require planning permission, but full use over 90 days does.\n6. The objective is to regulate short-term letting to affect the private rented accommodation supply.\n7. Local authorities handle implementation and enforcement.\n8. New planning permissions for short-term letting are generally prohibited in cities/towns with over 10,000 population; local discretion applies elsewhere.\n9. A National Planning Statement (NPS) is being developed.\n10. Short-term lets must register with Fáilte Ireland.\n11. The Short-Term Letting and Tourism Bill 2025 aims to implement EU regulations and extend RPZs until February 2026.\n12.

The zoning of land for particular purposes, including retail development, is an exercise undertaken by planning authorities as part of their overall statutory plan function generally as part of a development plan under sections 9 to 13 of the Planning and Development Act, 2000 (as amended), but can at present also be carried out as part of a local area plan (LAP) process. The making of a development plan or an LAP is a reserved function of the elected members of each authority.  In preparing their statutory plans, including in relation to the zoning of land for particular purposes, the elected members are required to consider and be consistent with, as appropriate, the National Planning Framework, Regional Spatial and Economic Strategies and relevant Ministerial planning guidelines.  With regard to the specific matter of the sale of nicotine inhaling products and consideration within the process of granting planning permission, under the provisions of the Planning and Development Regulations, 2001 (as amended) the definition of a shop includes a structure used for the retail sale of goods. The Regulations do not specify what types of goods may or may not be sold within a shop.  The evaluation of, or any research into, any public health impact of any particular products and the development of related guidance, would, in the first instance be a matter for the Department of Health under the auspices of policy initiatives such as Tobacco Free Ireland.

        "formatted_answer": "The National Planning Framework connects health and environment, guiding local authorities in zoning land for retail via development plans. Shops can sell any goods without specific restrictions. Public health evaluations related to product sales fall under the Department of Health's jurisdiction."
