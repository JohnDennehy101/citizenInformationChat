Such assessments, particularly those involving fairness, proportionality, and the respective contributions of parties, fall outside the institutional expertise of the Controller.  In contrast, the Courts possess the requisite experience and jurisprudential foundation to adjudicate on matters of equity, drawing on a well-established body of case law and a long-standing tradition of applying equitable remedies.  The Controller of Intellectual Property is responsible for the granting and registration of intellectual property rights in Ireland, specifically patent, trademark, and industrial design rights as provided for under the various Acts, Rules and Regulations for which the Controller has statutory responsibility.  The Controller also has certain statutory functions under the Copyright and Related Rights Act, 2000 (as amended), which are mainly concerned with the registration of copyright licensing bodies, references and applications relating to licensing schemes operated by those bodies.  The Office of the Controller of Intellectual property also disseminates information on intellectual property rights and provides my Department with input to the planning and drafting of certain intellectual property legislation and the formulation and implementation of policy in relation to the development of the system of intellectual property rights protection.

        "answerText": " Minister for Enterprise, Tourism and Employment  IDA Ireland’s new strategy, “Adapt Intelligently: A Strategy for Sustainable Growth and Innovation 2025-29” which I launched in February 2025, is one of ambition and opportunity, developed in the context of a changing global landscape and aligned with the Programme for Government and our White Paper on Enterprise. IDA, of course, also advocates for progression of wider national policy issues underpinning its strategy including on infrastructure and utilities, energy, EU and regulatory matters.  The Programme for Government includes a range of commitments led by my Department in conjunction with the IDA. In this regard, the IDA Strategy is strongly aligned with these Programme for Government commitments as well as wider national policies across Government. Several elements, specific to the IDA in the Programme for Government are already integral to the IDA strategy, including maximising regional opportunities through the agency’s Regional Property Programme and development of critical Next Generation Sites to attract large scale investments.  Furthermore, in line with the Programme for Government, IDA’s strategic objectives include retaining the existing strong FDI base, strengthening long term investment, scale cutting edge innovation, drive sustainable change, maximise regional opportunities and deepen and scale RD&I in Ireland and to win investment in key growth areas including digitalisation and artificial intelligence, semiconductors, health and sustainability.  On 19th May this year, I launched Silicon Island – Ireland’s National Semiconductor Strategy, another commitment in the Programme for Government and a key strategic sector for IDA with opportunities across Quantum Tech, Photonics, AI, Compound Semiconductors, and MedTech. Over €70 million in National and EU funding has been earmarked for Tyndall National Institute’s participation in three EU “Pilot Lines” under the Silicon Island which includes a significant exchequer contribution administered by the IDA. The Programme for Government also commits to the development of a National Life Sciences Strategy, a key sector for Ireland and IDA accounting for over 100,000 jobs and over €130 billion in exports.  Funding of the IDA through my Department is, of course, subject to the annual Estimates process with Oireachtas Grants supplemented by Own Resource Income (ORI) generated primarily from property transactions.

        "extracted_answer": "Minister for Enterprise, Tourism and Employment  IDA Ireland’s new strategy, “Adapt Intelligently: A Strategy for Sustainable Growth and Innovation 2025-29” which I launched in February 2025, is one of ambition and opportunity, developed in the context of a changing global landscape and aligned with the Programme for Government and our White Paper on Enterprise. IDA, of course, also advocates for progression of wider national policy issues underpinning its strategy including on infrastructure and utilities, energy, EU and regulatory matters.  The Programme for Government includes a range of commitments led by my Department in conjunction with the IDA. In this regard, the IDA Strategy is strongly aligned with these Programme for Government commitments as well as wider national policies across Government. Several elements, specific to the IDA in the Programme for Government are already integral to the IDA strategy, including maximising regional opportunities through the agency’s Regional Property Programme and development of critical Next Generation Sites to attract large scale investments.  Furthermore, in line with the Programme for Government, IDA’s strategic objectives include retaining the existing strong FDI base, strengthening long term investment, scale cutting edge innovation, drive sustainable change, maximise regional opportunities and deepen and scale RD&I in Ireland and to win investment in key growth areas including digitalisation and artificial intelligence, semiconductors, health and sustainability.  On 19th May this year, I launched Silicon Island – Ireland’s National Semiconductor Strategy, another commitment in the Programme for Government and a key strategic sector for IDA with opportunities across Quantum Tech, Photonics, AI, Compound Semiconductors, and MedTech. Over €70 million in National and EU funding has been earmarked for Tyndall National Institute’s participation in three EU “Pilot Lines” under the Silicon Island which includes a significant exchequer contribution administered by the IDA. The Programme for Government also commits to the development of a National Life Sciences Strategy, a key sector for Ireland and IDA accounting for over 100,000 jobs and over €130 billion in exports.  Funding of the IDA through my Department is, of course, subject to the annual Estimates process with Oireachtas Grants supplemented by Own Resource Income (ORI) generated primarily from property transactions. In 2025 the Exchequer allocation of €283m will be augmented by anticipated ORI of almost €58m.

This objective must be balanced by the need to ensure that there are no suitably qualified Irish or EEA nationals available to undertake the work and that the shortage is genuine.  The system is managed through the operation of the Critical Skills Occupations List (CSOL) and Ineligible Occupations List (IOL) which, respectively, prioritise specified in-demand professional roles and identify occupations for which a labour supply should be available in the Irish/EEA labour market.

        "formatted_answer": "The former factory in Rahoon, Galway, is not owned by IDA Ireland, as it was sold to a private owner. Therefore, IDA Ireland cannot market it to potential investors.

Under the Employment Equality Acts 1998-2015 all employers are obliged to provide reasonable accommodations to meet the needs of both employment candidates and employees with disabilities in the workplace. My Department as a public service employer also has a legal obligation under the Disability Act 2005 to, insofar as practicable, take all reasonable measures to promote and support the employment of people with disabilities.  For this purpose, staff are asked to indicate if they have any needs for reasonable accommodation related to a disability. Staff may also be asked to indicate if they require any particular health and safety supports relating to a disability, for example assistance or arrangements in relation to evacuating a building. These declarations and requests can be made confidentially and are dealt with by a dedicated Disability Liaison Officer.  The role of our Disability Liaison Officer is to act as a proactive contact for staff with disabilities, to assist and support them, and to assist in the implementation of best human resource practices in line with equality legislation. The Disability Liaison Officer works on a case by case basis to support staff with disabilities, and to help put in place the most appropriate reasonable accommodation which meets their needs. This can include working from home where appropriate. This year we have expanded this role to provide more support to managers seeking training, advice and awareness around managing staff with reasonable accommodations.  My Department has a needs assessment procedure to help identify workplace accommodations required by staff with a disability. There is a work assessment team which consists of Disability Liaison Officer, Health and Safety Officer, Access Officer, and ICT Officer for assistive technology/IT equipment. This team are available to provide support to any staff member with a disability in areas such as access throughout the building, workstations, access to toilet and canteen facilities, and evacuation procedures.  My Department also places a focus on learning and development opportunities that support people with disabilities in the workplace. My Department is a JAM Card friendly organisation since July 2024 with over 80% of staff having completed the JAM Card e-training and remains an ongoing initiative. In June last year, my Department also launched its first ED&I Strategy, which has a specific focus on providing equal opportunities for all staff, and on improving the culture of awareness around different needs in our workplace.  My Department’s Learning and Career Development Unit places a strong focus on disability awareness training and has facilitated several training sessions and webinars with organisations such as Ability Focus, Irish Centre for Diversity, AsIAm, ADHD Ireland, and Employers for Change amongst others; all of which presented segments on neurodiversity and reasonable accommodation. While attendance at same is optional, it is highly encouraged and promoted to all staff members regularly. ",

This is articulated in the Letta and Draghi Reports and has informed the European Commission’s recently published Work Programme which proposes a series of “Omnibus\" proposals. The first Omnibus dealing with sustainability matters was published on 26 February 2025 and proposes amendments to the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) and the Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CSDDD). Included in this Omnibus is the so-called “Stop-the-Clock” Directive which postpones the dates for certain corporate sustainability reporting and due diligence requirements. Consideration of the content aspects of the proposal is ongoing at EU level. My Department is continuing to assess the implications as these discussions progress.  Proposed changes to the CSRD include the limiting of reporting to large companies with over 1,000 employees, streamlining the European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS) data requirements, removing sector-specific standards, and delaying reporting deadlines for certain companies by two years to ease compliance burdens and allow for further preparation time and alignment with broader simplification efforts.  To ensure that SMEs not in scope of the Directive can choose to disclose sustainability information in a proportionate and standardised way, the European Financial Reporting Advisory Group (EFRAG), has developed a suite of voluntary standards for companies with fewer than 1,000 employees, known as \"VSME\" standards. This framework also acts as a protective mechanism by limiting the extent of data that larger companies can request from smaller entities in their value chains, while maintaining transparency and alignment with EU sustainability goals.  While the core principle of the EU’s original corporate sustainability reporting regime was well-founded in the context of the EU’s Green Deal, the level of administrative burden associated with the original CSRD was excessive, both for large companies and especially for small and medium companies.  In the context of optimising the competitiveness of EU companies in the evolving global trading environment and ensuring proportionality of the CSRD framework, Ireland is supportive in principle of initiatives to simplify the reporting requirements and reduce costs on European companies, and most especially for SMEs, under the EU’s sustainability reporting instruments.

As with other sectors, recruitment challenges exist in some schools including in Dublin and surrounding counties. To address teacher supply issues, the Government has implemented several measures that have led to:  • An increase of 20% in Initial Teacher Education graduates (student teachers) between 2018 and 2023, and a 30% increase in the number registered with the Teaching Council since 2017,  • The Teaching Council reported 94,928 teachers registered in the 2016/17 school year increasing to 122,743 teachers registered in 2023/24. Currently, the Teacher Council have reported that there are over 126,000 on the register representing a 33% increase in the number of teachers registered between 2017 and now.  • Recent data showed there were over 79,000 qualified teachers employed in Ireland with over 43,000 at primary level including special schools and over 36,000 in post-primary schools.  I am committed to addressing teacher supply and recently announced new measures including to help teachers gain permanent roles more quickly. Additionally, the Teaching Council is to streamline the registration process for eligible teachers who qualified outside of Ireland, allowing them to apply for registration and complete their induction requirements within the country.  Measures introduced in recent budgets included:  • Budget 2025 introduced a €2,000 bursary to increase the number of qualified STEM teachers in post-primary schools payable in the final two years of their undergraduate programme, in exchange for a two-year teaching commitment.  • Budget 2024 introduced a PME fee refund scheme: a €2,000 bursary for teachers graduating with a Professional Master of Education (PME) in 2024 , aimed at encouraging newly qualified teachers to take up roles in primary and post-primary schools, and  • An expansion of upskilling programmes under Budget 2024 and continued in 2025, offering free courses to teachers in high-demand subjects to reduce out-of-field teaching. New programmes in Irish, French, politics & society, and computer science will commence in 2025 and complement existing programmes in maths, physics, and Spanish.  In addition, other key initiatives introduced include:  • Commencement of workforce planning for teachers. A new project, supported by UNESCO and the EU Commission, will create a strategic plan for managing Ireland’s teaching workforce. The project aims to consider the sustainability of the teaching profession in Ireland, with a focus on the factors that impact teacher supply. This two-year project will involve consultations with key stakeholders to develop recommendations.  • Development of the Teaching Transforms campaign, which promotes the teaching profession and encourage students to follow a career in teaching. The campaigns use digital, radio and video media, and have been developed to coincide with the CAO closing date and change of mind deadline in recent years  These measures reflect the commitment to ongoing investment in the education system to address teacher supply and are designed to ensure a steady flow of qualified teachers into the profession.  Teaching is an attractive career choice:  • With 3,700 newly qualified teachers registered with the Teaching Council in 2024 and over 126,000 now on the register.  • First preference data from the CAO published for February this year showed increases in primary first preferences of 9% and in post-primary of 5%.  • Teacher’s pay has increased significantly in recent years with a new entrants’ current rate of €44,435 for primary and €45,829 for post-primary teachers. The new public service pay agreement means further increases to €46,000, which represents an over 46% increase on the 2013 salary. The new pay deal will mean that teachers’ salary will increase to a maximum of €85,000 per year which compares well internationally.  My Department frequently consults and engages closely with stakeholders on issues such as teacher supply through industrial relations forums, sectoral meetings, and direct discussions with teacher unions. I am considering further measures to strengthen the teaching workforce and ensure that schools have the support needed to provide an excellent education for every student. ",

This will ensure that classes can open quickly as existing accommodation can be reconfigured in a more streamlined and efficient manner but also that new provision is established in as many schools as possible.

The government is committed to the provision of additional special school places for children with more complex educational needs. Over 300 new special school places are being provided for the coming 2025/2026 school year. Five new special schools are being established in addition to the eleven new special schools opened over the last few years. Special school capacity is also being expanded across a number of special schools.  It’s important to note that it is not the intention to exclude children who require a special school place from accessing certain special school settings, but rather allow children with complex educational needs apply to their local special school. Currently, there are instances whereby children with complex needs cannot apply for admission to their local special school simply because they don’t meet the narrow designation of that special school. In that regard, along with providing additional special school capacity, my department and the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) consider that it is necessary to look at the profile of our existing special schools.  This is not a new departure. The NCSE report that over half of mild general learning disability (MGLD) special schools have diversified to allow children with more complex needs in their communities who require a special school setting enrol in their local special school. I wish to thank schools who have worked with us to broaden their designation and my department will continue to support schools in this endeavour so that more special schools can better support children with complex needs in their local community.  There are approximately 30 of our 129 special schools that were originally designated as schools for children with a MGLD. The establishment of these special schools predated the significant expansion in the range of supports offered in mainstream schools through additional special education teaching and special needs assistant resources and through the rapid expansion in special class provision.

This will mean that some interim/transition arrangements will be required from 1 September until the modular unit is ready for occupation.

        "extracted_answer": "Minister for Education and Youth  The school to which the deputy refers will be provided with two special needs classrooms under my Department’s SEN Reconfiguration and Modular Accommodation programme.  This programme involves the use of Project Management supports which is designed to enable the accommodation to be provided as quickly as possible and help ease the administrative workload for school authorities in relation to the management and delivery of projects. Kerrigan Sheanon Newman Project Management (KSN) has been appointed, from the Department’s Framework, to design and tender the project and oversee all elements of construction.  The contractor is expected to commence mobilising on site on Tuesday 24 June.  The modular units are manufactured. The Department is engaging with the school and patron on the practical arrangements in relation to the provision of the modular units, including fit-out and it is expected that this will be finalised shortly.  The Project Managers and the modular supplier are working very proactively to have the modular unit in place as early as possible in Q4 2025. This will mean that some interim/transition arrangements will be required from 1 September until the modular unit is ready for occupation. The precise length of time for these interim/transition arrangements will become clearer over the summer period as the on-site works progress and the modular unit is set up on site, linked to services, commissioned and certified.",

Construction is scheduled to start on June 24. The modular units are manufactured, and final arrangements with the school are being made. The target completion date is Q4 2025, with interim arrangements expected from September until the units are ready."

Since September 2023 my department has been providing a payroll service for former grant funded school secretaries.

I acknowledge that Forsa are looking to further improve terms and conditions for secretaries and caretakers and recognise that for them, public service status and access to a public service pension is understandably an important objective.

The Advisory Committee is tasked with developing policy advice and national guidelines on the restitution of cultural heritage objects in Ireland that may have been illegally or unethically elicited, or traded. It will also address matters pertaining to items of Irish origin in international collections and how best to repatriate these, if necessary and when appropriate.

I appreciate the importance of the Basic Income support for artists, which is why last week I announced that Cabinet had agreed to my proposal to an extension of six months to allow for further evaluation of the pilot data. This will also give sufficient time to engage in stakeholder consultation and to evaluate the data which will provide the evidence base for Government to make decisions on the next steps.  The primary objective of the scheme is to help artists deal with precarious incomes and to prevent talent from leaving the sector for economic reasons. Evaluation of the pilot is and has been continuous, with participants completing a detailed survey every six months. My Department has been undertaking a comprehensive research programme based on this data.  I am aware that there is broad-based support for the scheme, and I have met with the NCFA (National Campaign for the Arts) to discuss the scheme. I intend to bring proposals for a permanent intervention to Cabinet as part of Budget 2026, based on the evidence arising from the research programme and stakeholder engagement.  The current scheme costs just under €35m per year to provide the payment to 2,000 recipients. The cost of the 6-month extension is €16.7m. The net overall cost to of the pilot to the Exchequer is likely to be less given the high number of BIA recipients who were previously on social welfare supports prior to the BIA, and a Cost Benefit Analysis currently underway should bring further clarity to the overall costs.  While the research phase of the pilot scheme is still ongoing, it is clear from evidence collected to date under the scheme that the BIA it is having a positive impact on participants.  I know that the BIA support is hugely valued by artists in receipt of it, it has also been the subject of much positive commentary at home and in an international context and makes an important statement about the value placed on the arts in Ireland.

The Programme for Government commits to assessing the Basic Income for the Arts pilot research scheme to maximise its impact. I appreciate the importance of the Basic Income support for artists, which is why last week I announced that Cabinet had agreed to my proposal to an extension of six months to allow for further evaluation of the pilot data. This will also give sufficient time to engage in stakeholder consultation and to evaluate the data which will provide the evidence base for Government to make decisions on the next steps.  The current scheme costs just under €35m per year to provide the payment to 2,000 recipients. The cost of the 6-month extension is €16.7m. The net overall cost to of the pilot to the Exchequer is likely to be less given the high number of BIA recipients who were previously on social welfare supports prior to the BIA, and a Cost Benefit Analysis currently underway should bring further clarity to the overall costs.

While the research phase of the pilot scheme is still ongoing, it is clear from evidence collected to date under the scheme that the BIA it is having a positive impact on participants.  I know that the BIA support is hugely valued by artists in receipt of it, it has also been the subject of much positive commentary at home and in an international context and makes an important statement about the value placed on the arts in Ireland.  A Government decision will be required on a successor scheme to the pilot, and the future of the BIA will be decided when the final results of the research are available.",
        "formatted_question": "Will the pilot basic income scheme for the arts be made a permanent payment scheme through an annual budget allocation?",
        "formatted_answer": "The pilot basic income scheme for the arts has been extended by six months for further evaluation. The scheme currently costs €34.9 million annually, supporting 2,000 recipients. The extension costs €16.7 million. A Cost Benefit Analysis is underway to assess costs. Recipient data by county is available, showing participation numbers. A decision on a permanent scheme will be made after the research concludes."

The scheme has now been operating for almost three years and is underpinned by a robust research programme collecting data about all aspects of the lives of the artists and creative arts workers who are participating in the scheme.  Last week I announced that Cabinet had agreed to my proposal to an extension of six months to February 2026 to allow for further evaluation of the pilot data, which will provide the evidence base for Government to make decisions on the next steps. This will also give sufficient time to engage in stakeholder consultation.  The Programme for Government and the Government’s Research and Innovation Strategy note the importance of incorporating use of evidence into the policy development process, and of improving links between policy makers and researchers. This is a key programme to bring research and data to provide an evidence base for Government to make decisions on future policy for the arts.  The BIA research pilot is designed as a randomised control trial in order to make it possible to identify causality and has benefitted from the involvement of external researchers. This randomised control trial includes a Treatment Group of 2,000, that is the recipients of the payment, and a Control Group of 1,000 who are not in receipt of the payment.  This is the first large-scale randomised control test undertaken by a Government Department in Ireland and represents one of the leading impact evaluations underway in the Public Sector. Evaluation of the pilot is and has been continuous, with participants completing a detailed survey every six months. My Department has been undertaking a broad research programme, including:  • two papers based on baseline survey i.e. information about participants lives before they received the first BIA payment;  • two impact assessments have been published to date and my Department is currently preparing a report examining the first 24 months of the scheme, due to be published over the summer months; and  • an interview research paper, written by an independent researcher, was also published recently. This paper collects the experiences of 50 BIA recipients, who have been interviewed by a sociologist.  While the research phase of the pilot scheme is still ongoing, it is clear from evidence collected to date, under the scheme, by my Department, that it is having a positive impact on participants. This data shows that the BIA payment is having a consistent, positive impact across almost all indicators - affecting practice development, sectoral retention, well-being, and deprivation.  In terms of ongoing evaluation of the scheme, work has recently begun with an external independent economic consultancy to prepare a full cost-benefit analysis of the BIA.

The Scheme aims to provide employment opportunities for emerging artists and professionals, including production staff and crew who are dependent on live performances.  The Scheme operated with a total fund of €500,000 and grants were available of up to €15,000 to host events showcasing the talent of emerging, grassroots artists, performing live music that they have written or created themselves. The Scheme was extremely popular and it was closed in early April as it was oversubscribed.  A total of 96 applications were received by my Department. Applications were assessed by my officials strictly by order of date and time of receipt and all venues had to meet the eligibility criteria and conditions of funding, in accordance with the guidelines of the Scheme.  Of the 96 applications received, a total of 45 were eligible for funding. I recently announced the names of 33 venues that were awarded funding.

I appreciate the importance of the Basic Income support for artists, which is why last week I announced that Cabinet had agreed to my proposal to an extension of six months to allow for further evaluation of the pilot data. This will also give sufficient time to engage in stakeholder consultation and to evaluate the data which will provide the evidence base for Government to make decisions on the next steps.  The primary objective of the scheme is to help artists deal with precarious incomes and to prevent talent from leaving the sector for economic reasons. Evaluation of the pilot is and has been continuous, with participants completing a detailed survey every six months. My Department has been undertaking a comprehensive research programme based on this data.  The cost benefit analysis which is currently being undertaken will include a sub-group analysis that will examine the impact on artists with a disability, among other groups. The 6-month extension will provide time for stakeholder engagement which will include engagement with disabled artists' groups among others.  Eligibility for social protection allowances are a matter for the Minister for Social Protection and I have no statutory function in this regard. However, my Department has established a Consultative Committee whose membership includes the Department of Social Protection, the purpose of this group is to share at an interdepartmental level the outcomes of the research on the BIA.  Evaluation of the pilot is and has been continuous, with participants completing a detailed survey every six months. My Department has been undertaking a broad research programme, including:  • two papers based on baseline survey i.e. information about participants lives before they received the first BIA payment;  • two impact assessments have been published to date and my Department is currently preparing a report examining the first 24 months of the scheme, due to be published over the summer months; and  • an interview research paper, written by an independent researcher, was also published recently. This paper collects the experiences of 50 BIA recipients, who have been interviewed by a sociologist.  While the research phase of the pilot scheme is still ongoing, it is clear from evidence collected to date, under the scheme, by my Department, that it is having a positive impact on participants. This data shows that the BIA payment is having a consistent, positive impact across almost all indicators - affecting practice development, sectoral retention, well-being, and deprivation.  In terms of ongoing evaluation of the scheme, work has recently begun with an external independent economic consultancy to prepare a full cost-benefit analysis of the BIA.

The Directive requires that projects listed in Annex I of the Directive be subject to mandatory EIA and provides that Member States may determine whether projects listed in Annex II of the Directive shall be subject to EIA.

Circumstances may arise in which a project may be subject to a requirement for EIA if, for example, one or more aspects of that project comes within the scope of any of the project classes listed in Annex I or Annex II of the Directive. It would therefore be a matter for the planning authority concerned or the Commission to assess all aspects of any planning application for a stationary battery energy storage development the determined whether any aspect of the project comes within the scope of any of the project classes listed in the Directive and transposing legislation, and in that context whether an EIA is required.

        "answerText": " Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage (Deputy James Browne)  On 10 June 2025, the Government approved stronger tenancy protections and greater certainty for the rental sector, including the introduction of a national rent control, as part of a suite of measures to boost the supply of new homes and secure and grow the availability of rental accommodation.  The Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2025 was signed into law on 19 June 2025. The Act came into operation on 20 June 2025 to immediately extend and expand the operation of Rent Pressure Zones (RPZs) to cover the entire country until 28 February 2026. Further legislation is being developed to apply stronger tenancy protections to new tenancies created (i.e. first time tenancies between parties) from 1 March 2026. With the exception of new build apartments, annual rent increases in all new tenancies created after 1 March 2026 will be capped at the level of inflation (CPI) up to a maximum of 2%. For new build apartments, annual rent increases will be capped at the level of inflation (CPI).  For such tenancies, unless a 'no fault eviction' occurs, a landlord will be allowed to set the rent to market value at the start of the tenancy and at the end of every 6-year period that the tenancy continues to exist.  In order to provide greater security of tenure to tenants, legislative changes will apply to significantly restrict ‘no fault evictions’. These changes will significantly enhance the current provision of tenancies of unlimited duration with the introduction of tenancies of minimum duration (TMD), involving rolling 6-year tenancies, for any new tenancy created on/after 1 March 2026 by a smaller landlord (with 3 or fewer tenancies) with a new tenant.  I will continue to engage with the Office of the Attorney General and the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science during the drafting of legislation on the tailored arrangements to apply to student specific accommodation. Increasing the availability of suitable, financially accessible student accommodation is a key policy priority for Government and will be addressed in the new Student Accommodation Strategy, being developed by the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science for publication later this year.

[34937/25]",
        "extracted_answer": "Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage (Deputy James Browne)  On 10 June 2025, the Government approved stronger tenancy protections and greater certainty for the rental sector, including the introduction of a national rent control, as part of a suite of measures to boost the supply of new homes and secure and grow the availability of rental accommodation.  The Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2025 was signed into law on 19 June 2025. The Act came into operation on 20 June 2025 to immediately extend and expand the operation of Rent Pressure Zones (RPZs) to cover the entire country until 28 February 2026. Further legislation is being developed to apply stronger tenancy protections to new tenancies created (i.e. first time tenancies between parties) from 1 March 2026. With the exception of new build apartments, annual rent increases in all new tenancies created after 1 March 2026 will be capped at the level of inflation (CPI) up to a maximum of 2%. For new build apartments, annual rent increases will be capped at the level of inflation (CPI).  For such tenancies, unless a 'no fault eviction' occurs, a landlord will be allowed to set the rent to market value at the start of the tenancy and at the end of every 6-year period that the tenancy continues to exist.  In order to provide greater security of tenure to tenants, legislative changes will apply to significantly restrict ‘no fault evictions’. These changes will significantly enhance the current provision of tenancies of unlimited duration with the introduction of tenancies of minimum duration (TMD), involving rolling 6-year tenancies, for any new tenancy created on/after 1 March 2026 by a smaller landlord (with 3 or fewer tenancies) with a new tenant.  I will continue to engage with the Office of the Attorney General and the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science during the drafting of legislation on the tailored arrangements to apply to student specific accommodation. Increasing the availability of suitable, financially accessible student accommodation is a key policy priority for Government and will be addressed in the new Student Accommodation Strategy, being developed by the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science for publication later this year. Affordability and equity will be at core of the Strategy.",
        "formatted_question": "How will full-time students in privately rented accommodation with leases under six years be protected from excessive rent increases starting March 1, 2026?",
        "formatted_answer": "On June 10, 2025, the Government approved stronger tenancy protections, including national rent control, under the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2025, which came into effect on June 20, 2025. This expanded Rent Pressure Zones (RPZs) nationwide until February 28, 2026. New legislation for tenancies starting March 1, 2026, will cap annual rent increases at the Consumer Price Index (CPI) up to 2%, except for new build apartments, which can be set to market value every six years if no 'no fault eviction' occurs. 'No fault evictions' will be restricted, and tenancies of minimum duration (TMD) will be introduced for smaller landlords. The Government is developing tailored arrangements for student accommodation and a new strategy to increase student housing availability."

The Programme for Government contains a commitment to introduce the Automatic Enrolment (AE) Retirement Savings System. The legislative basis for implementing the new system was enacted last July. The aim of introducing AE is to address the pension coverage gap that exists in Ireland and to provide workers with greater comfort and security regarding their retirement savings. I recently announced the system, to be known by its brand name, 'My Future Fund', will commence from 1st January 2026.  It has long been recognised that supplementary pension coverage in Ireland among private sector workers is too low. It is estimated that just one-in-three private sector workers are actively contributing to occupational or private pension schemes. This may lead to these workers being reliant solely on the State Pension in retirement, which may in turn result in an unwanted reduction in their living standards.  In order to address this challenge, My Future Fund will see a transition from the current voluntary system to one which will, subject to certain parameters, automatically enrol employees into a quality assured retirement savings system. The saver will maintain some freedom of choice to opt-out.  While current occupational and private pension savings arrangements financially incentivise participation through tax relief on contributions at the participant's appliable income tax rate, the AE system will instead use a direct State top-up contribution. This top-up contribution will be applied equally to each participant at a rate of €1 for each €3 contributed by them, and is the equivalent of 25% tax relief.  The State top-up approach makes the auto-enrolment system highly equitable. Whether it represents a higher or lower financial incentive for a participant will be dependent upon their individual circumstances.  It cannot be said that My Future Fund will be less beneficial to a worker who pays tax at 40%. After all, anybody who will be auto-enrolled is not in a pension scheme and consequently is not receiving any benefit at present. In addition, to simply compare the state incentivisation aspect alone could give a misleading understanding of benefit to individuals. It is really important to note that other factors such as the applicable contribution rates, the income base on which contributions are calculated, tax relief, ancilliary benefits, administrative and fund charges, investment returns, employer support and other terms and conditions of a pension scheme all have a considerable bearing on the overall value of the scheme to its participants. In that context, My Future Fund will provide very significant benefit to all participants of the scheme regardless of their tax rate.  To support understanding of how the system works, the Department is currently running a communications campaign to inform both employers and employees about auto-enrolment, including how the State incentive differs from tax relief on private pensions. This campaign will intensify over the coming months to the launch of the scheme from 1 January 2026.  While the very specific and stratified data that the Deputy is seeking is not yet available, a minority of around 25% of the more than 800,000 employees that may be eligible for enrolment into My Future Fund are likely to be paying income tax at the higher rate, according to ESRI analysis.

This campaign will intensify over the coming months to the launch of the scheme from 1 January 2026.  While the very specific and stratified data that the Deputy is seeking is not yet available, a minority of around 25% of the more than 800,000 employees that may be eligible for enrolment into My Future Fund are likely to be paying income tax at the higher rate, according to ESRI analysis.

        "formatted_question": "What are the expected numbers of contributors paying the 40% income tax rate under the auto-enrolment scheme, both in absolute numbers and as a percentage of all contributors?",
        "formatted_answer": "The auto-enrolment scheme, named \"My Future Fund,\" will begin on January 1, 2026. Currently, about 33% of private sector workers contribute to pensions. The State offers a €1 top-up for every €3 contributed, equivalent to 25% tax relief. According to ESRI analysis, approximately 25% of the estimated 800,000 eligible employees are expected to pay the higher tax rate."

        "answerText": " Minister for Social Protection  I propose to take Questions Nos. 125, 126 and 127 together.  The Programme for Government contains a commitment to introduce the Automatic Enrolment (AE) Retirement Savings System. The legislative basis for implementing the new system was enacted last July. The aim of introducing AE is to address the pension coverage gap that exists in Ireland and to provide workers with greater comfort and security regarding their retirement savings. I recently announced the system, to be known by its brand name, 'My Future Fund', will commence from 1st January 2026.  It has long been recognised that supplementary pension coverage in Ireland among private sector workers is too low. It is estimated that just one-in-three private sector workers are actively contributing to occupational or private pension schemes. This may lead to these workers being reliant solely on the State Pension in retirement, which may in turn result in an unwanted reduction in their living standards.  In order to address this challenge, My Future Fund will see a transition from the current voluntary system to one which will, subject to certain parameters, automatically enrol employees into a quality assured retirement savings system. The saver will maintain some freedom of choice to opt-out.  While current occupational and private pension savings arrangements financially incentivise participation through tax relief on contributions at the participant's appliable income tax rate, the AE system will instead use a direct State top-up contribution. This top-up contribution will be applied equally to each participant at a rate of €1 for each €3 contributed by them, and is the equivalent of 25% tax relief.  The State top-up approach makes the auto-enrolment system highly equitable. Whether it represents a higher or lower financial incentive for a participant will be dependent upon their individual circumstances.  It cannot be said that My Future Fund will be less beneficial to a worker who pays tax at 40%. After all, anybody who will be auto-enrolled is not in a pension scheme and consequently is not receiving any benefit at present.

This includes families, people in employment, unemployed people, people with illnesses and disabilities, carers, older people and employers. I believe it is crucial that my officials act with empathy and courtesy at all times.  My Department is acutely aware of the profound impact that the loss of a child has on parents and families. While we do not have a specific standard operating procedure solely for dealing with bereaved parents of children, all staff are guided by overarching principles of compassion, respect, and human dignity in their interactions with customers.  Customer service training is mandatory for all staff and includes guidance on recognising and responding sensitively to customers who may be experiencing grief, loss, or other emotional distress. This training ensures that staff are equipped with the skills and awareness needed to support individuals in vulnerable circumstances, including bereaved parents. The training highlights the importance of empathy, patience, and understanding, and encourages staff to take time to listen and respond appropriately to each customer’s needs.  The Department's Customer Charter, which is prominently displayed in our offices, commits staff to treating all customers with politeness, courtesy and respect. It promises that we will inform customers of their rights, entitlements, and responsibilities and direct customers to the service(s) or supports they need.  In our Code of Conduct for office interviews and the Code of Conduct for staff engaged in outdoor functions, staff are reminded that they should be mindful of any special circumstances that might apply to the person involved including personal issues. They are obliged to conduct the interview with consideration, sensitivity, understanding and empathy.  Certain front-line areas of my Department have also been provided with Trauma Informed Practice training, to develop staff capacity to deal with customers who have experienced trauma in a sensitive and appropriate manner.  My Department is currently working to provide a Quiet Room in a total of 55 Intreo Centres across the state. These rooms are specially designed to provide a sensory-friendly experience to help individuals feel calm and conduct their business with us easily and in private. They will be available for any customer who would benefit from additional privacy or a calmer, quiet environment including those who have suffered loss of a loved one, should they wish to use them.  Some payments may continue if a child dies, for example:  • If a child dependent of a social welfare recipient dies, the Child Support Payment (previously called an Increase for a Qualified Child or IQC) on the social welfare payment will continue for 6 weeks, if the child was included in the payment.  • Where there is one qualified child on a One-Parent Family Payment (OFP) and that child dies, the OFP and Child Support Payment will continue for 6 weeks.  • Payment of Carer's Allowance (www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/carers/carers-allowance/) (full or half-rate) continues to be made for 12 weeks after the death of the person being cared for. Payment of Carer's Benefit (www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/carers/carers-benefit/)continues to be made for 6 weeks after the death of the person being cared for.  • Domiciliary Care Allowance continues to be paid for 3 months in cases where the child being cared for has died.  Support towards funeral costs is also available if a person or family is unable to cover the essential costs of funeral arrangements. In such circumstances an application may be made for an Additional Needs Payment to the Community Welfare Service of my Department.  I am committed to maintaining a supportive and respectful environment for all customers, especially those who are grieving. I believe that treating people with kindness and respect is fundamental to delivering effective public services, and this ethos is reinforced through the ongoing staff training and development of my Department. People who are grieving, and particularly those who have lost a child, can be assured that they will be treated with empathy and dignity and assisted in receiving all of the appropriate supports my Department can offer.
