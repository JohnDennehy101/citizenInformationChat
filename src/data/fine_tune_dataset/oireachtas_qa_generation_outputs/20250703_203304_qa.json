The commitment is underpinned by unparalleled levels of investment as we move to universal access to health care. However, until the capacity is in place to meet the increased levels of demand, it is necessary in the interim to make use of all available capacity in the public and private systems to ensure that patients have access to the care they need.  The waiting list action plan 2025 includes targeting the delivery of additional capacity in the public and private systems through a co-ordinated approach by the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF. NTPF insourcing initiatives are governed by a memorandum of understanding, MOU, between the NTPF and the relevant public hospital. Under the MOU, the public hospital confirms that any such work is additional work over and above core hospital activity and is specifically carried out to reduce waiting lists.  In early April I requested that the HSE CEO initiate a detailed survey of all insourcing activity within the HSE to include activity funded directly by the hospital concerned and by the NTPF. The review is being co-ordinated through his office, assisted by finance, internal audit, HR and access and integration functions. The outcome of this review is expected shortly and will determine the appropriate next steps. We need to move away from this model by maximising internal underutilised capacity, whilst at the same time not negatively impact on patient waiting times and outcomes. \n Deputy Sorca Clarke  I want to begin by acknowledging the great work done by staff in Children's Health Ireland, CHI. However, in the past month details of an unpublished report conducted on the clinical department of CHI at Crumlin hospital has been put into the public domain. One of the revelations in the report was a finding of several inappropriate and unnecessary NTPF-funded Saturday clinics conducted by a consultant. The report details how a consultant was facilitated to set up hundreds of appointments for patients who did not need to see him. He then placed these patients on his own waiting lists, which resulted in patients waiting twice as long as they would have otherwise. The report states that 95% of those patients could have been accommodated during normal working hours, that is Monday to Friday, without the need for NTPF funding. How confident is Minister that the audit will be able to identify this type of misuse of funds? \n Deputy Jennifer Carroll MacNeill  It is an excellent question. It is exactly what I have asked Bernard Gloster to do. Of course, I have to wait for the report to be able to express my confidence in the quality of the work that has come back. The Deputy may take that as a reference example. As I said my opening reply, if there was underutilised capacity, that is, as the report states, other people in the hospital could have held surgeries at an earlier period but did not due to the waiting list management process, that is very serious.  In advance of receiving the insourcing report, we have mandated a centralised referral mechanism so that if someone is referred to surgery, they are not referred to Jennifer, Sorca or whoever. Rather, patients are referred to the system and will then be allocated an appointment according to capacity rather than an individual consultant having the capacity to manage their lists or patients in a way that is unhelpful. \n Deputy Sorca Clarke  I thank the Minister. There has been a significant increase in Saturday clinics over the past years. An example of this concerns scopes. More than 10% of scopes are now done on a Saturday but the distribution is very uneven across hospitals. Of the scopes carried out in Cavan hospital, one third are now done on a Saturday, that is 900 out of a total of 2,700. However, hospitals are still conducting fewer scopes than they were in 2019 when all services were provided between Monday and Friday. Waiting lists did not reduce during 2024 but they have reduced this year.  The system may be working and I do not doubt Cavan hospital in that regard. However, the CHI revelations are startling and there is real concern that this may be the tip of the iceberg. There is also concern that the quality might be suffering in some of the Saturday clinics or productivity could be higher during Monday to Friday. How is the Minister ensuring that hospitals are preventing the misuse of public funds and controlling spending and waiting lists initiatives? What is the breakdown of weekend hospital activity between the new public consulting contract and the fee paying service clinics? What action does Minister intend to take if she is not happy or there are unanswered questions when Bernard Gloster and the HSE bring forward the audit report? \n Deputy Jennifer Carroll MacNeill  The Deputy raised the issue I am concerned about, namely that there are incentives to be under productive during the working week with a view to, or which have the outcome of, very busy clinics on Saturdays or bank holiday Mondays. That is exactly the sort of incentive I need to see stop.  I cannot speak to the relative activity because I do not have that data. The Deputy's example is precisely the sort of example that prompted me to conduct the work on insourcing. I wish I was a couple of weeks ahead and had the data and could give her a better answer, but I will have the information during the next Priority Questions session. The Deputy is highlighting exactly what I might be concerned about.  To be fair, Saturday clinics and the NTPF meet those who have waited the longest and there is a need for that work, as she acknowledged. These sorts of incentives or opportunities are precisely what I am trying to identify, along with variations across hospitals or specialisms within hospitals, which is also important. I want to find ways to make sure that we are not permitting those incentives and there is a standardised approach that we can stand over and thereby reduce our dependence on such a system. ",

        "answerText": " Deputy Pádraig Rice  Access to symptomatic breast disease clinics has become a postcode lottery. Following an urgent GP referral, a person should be seen by a clinic within two weeks. However, timely access to these clinics varies widely. Last year, only four out of nine hospitals met the target of seeing 95% of urgent referrals within two weeks. The other five failed. The Mater Hospital only reached 29%, St. James's Hospital 51% and Letterkenny 58%. Some of these are shocking failures. It should not matter where one lives; no person should have to wait more than two weeks. These are urgent referrals. Where is the sense of urgency? \n Deputy Jennifer Carroll MacNeill  There are nine HSE rapid access symptomatic breast disease clinics nationally, as the Deputy knows. The HSE has set a target of 95% of urgent referrals being seen within ten working days. Non-urgent referrals should be seen within 12 weeks. The HSE national cancer control programme monitors the performance of these clinics. Last year, national compliance with targets was 76% for urgent and non-urgent referrals but I recognise the variations the Deputy described. While five centres generally met or exceeded the targets during the year, four did not. This is often caused by staff shortages or problems in accessing diagnostics or radiology services.  These clinics consistently operate at full capacity. Unfortunately, any disruption to services can lead to a backlog, which can take time to clear. Where a performance issue arises, the HSE implements site-specific measures, but it may also need to implement regional measures, which we can discuss further. These can include funding additional clinics or providing locum cover where necessary.  The national cancer control programme is also developing new or modified pathways for certain patient cohorts. These aim to make better use of available capacity and provide appropriate access for high-risk patients such as those with a family history of breast cancer. My Department is also reviewing diagnostic services to ensure that capacity is fully maximised. The Government's commitment to cancer services is reflected in significant investment, with more than €105 million provided for cancer services under the national cancer strategy, including €23 million in 2025. Nevertheless, there is a great deal more I would like to say about it. Perhaps I can do so in a supplementary reply. \n Deputy Pádraig Rice  One report states that one in four people waited longer than recommended for an appointment at these urgent clinics. I would like to share with the Minister the experiences of two women from north Dublin. They had to wait for in excess of the two-week period to be seen by the matters symptomatic breast clinic. In February, one woman was referred by GP due to the presence of two lumps in her breast. However, when the Mater Hospital received the referral, she was told the waiting time to be seen had risen to three months.  Let us imagine receiving this news at a time of extreme uncertainty and fear. It was May before she received her appointment at the Mater. Another symptomatic patient in the Mater who had been waiting for an appointment since April was seen last Monday, two months later. During these agonising two months all these women were told was that the Mater's BreastCheck clinic was understaffed and there was no estimated appointment date to be provided. In what world is this acceptable? What has happened to this country's cancer services? Cancer care used to be regarded as the jewel in the crown of our health services. \n Deputy Jennifer Carroll MacNeill  The Deputy is right. Yesterday I was at St. James's Hospital and it and Trinity College have become one of the accredited cancer centres of the Organisation of European Cancer Institutes. There are many accredited centres but this is at a different level. It is the most prestigious award for cancer control. The Deputy is correct that we have very good services. He asked in what world is this acceptable. There is no world in which it is acceptable and there is no world in which the Mater's figures are remotely acceptable.  Let me also say that like the Deputy I have correspondence from the breast health unit in the Mater and I am deeply disappointed with the content and the tone of the letter being sent to women who are not just going for BreastCheck but who are going because there is a problem. I have written to the CEO of the Mater hospital to express my concern about this and to ask for the number of people waiting on it. I have also asked the regional executive officers for that area and the adjoining area, which includes St. Vincent's University Hospital and Tallaght University Hospital, to come up with a regional solution that meets the needs because this is absolutely unacceptable. \n Deputy Pádraig Rice  We absolutely need better planning here. A lot of this comes back to staffing. Greater resources must be allocated specifically to breast clinics to ensure adequate staffing throughout the country, regardless of where people live. To secure cancer care pathways greater workforce planning is required but this cannot be siloed in the Department of Health. We need joined-up thinking. The Departments of Health and higher education must work together to ensure people are able to access places on various healthcare courses, especially radiology given its key role in diagnostics. The HSE also has a role as it must ensure there are enough clinical placements for trainees. Crucially, we need to ensure people can stay in Ireland to work in our healthcare system after qualification. As the Minister has said, these are very concerning findings. These are women who have symptoms and who are waiting for too long to be seen. It needs to be addressed urgently. \n Deputy Jennifer Carroll MacNeill  I thank the Deputy and I agree with him on all of these points. Yesterday at the health committee we covered some of the workforce planning issues and the expansion of training places. It is also a workforce management issue and the variation between hospitals is well noted. I am told that in the Mater there have been long-standing recruitment challenges but they have been stabilised. There has been a consistently high volume of urgent referrals with difficulty in accessing radiology in St. James's Hospital. A lean project is under way to improve efficiencies. In Letterkenny the hospital has met the urgent KPI targets for the past three months, although the figure for the year to date is 85% following a poor performance in January. St. Vincent's Hospital has been meeting the urgent KPI since last September and it is at 99%. Cork University Hospital remains in the 80% to 90% range for urgent referrals.  I know the Deputy did not raise this necessarily in the parliamentary question but Galway University Hospital's performance this year has averaged 33% but it is expected to show improvement in May because of the appointment of a replacement breast surgeon. He and I are having to discuss this on a hospital-by-hospital basis and we have to make sure the system is across itself. ",

Last year, national compliance was 76% for urgent and 74% for non-urgent referrals. Five centers met or exceeded targets, while four did not, often due to staff shortages or diagnostic issues. The HSE monitors performance and implements measures like additional funding or locum cover. €105 million has been invested in cancer services, including €23 million in 2025. Specific examples include Mater Hospital at 29%, St. James's Hospital at 51%, and Letterkenny at 58%. Some hospitals, like St. Vincent's, have improved to 99%. Lean projects and recruitment efforts are underway to address these issues."

        "answerText": " Deputy Sorca Clarke  Will the Minister detail the steps she has taken to improve governance and accountability at Children's Health Ireland and will she publish the unpublished review of a department at CHI at Crumlin? Will she outline the steps she has taken to address the issues highlighted in the report? \n Deputy Jennifer Carroll MacNeill  In response to a series of reviews which raised corporate and clinical governance concerns at CHI, I have moved to strengthen governance and oversight structures at CHI in a range of different way. This was done via the appointment of two members of the HSE board to the board of CHI on 28 May. There are more board appointments to be made. This means that all but one members of the board have been appointed since 2024. This is a different reference period to some of these activities.  The service level agreement between CHI and the HSE has been strengthened, and there is significantly increased involvement from the Dublin and midlands regional executive officer. Recognising the need to co-ordinate oversight of the range of matters of focus in CHI in a cohesive fashion, the HSE CEO has established the HSE CHI improvement steering group. These actions are designed to support the new CEO in CHI and enable her to continue with the transformation programme she has started.  Regarding the 2022 internal examination referenced by the Deputy, I have been advised by the Attorney General that I do not have the legal basis to publish this report. I sought that legal advice with a view to trying to put it into the public domain correctly. I received it correctly but it is the property of CHI and I do not have the power myself to publish it. Any publication must be made by CHI. On 16 June, CHI published a summary of the report. Subsequent to my letter on 26 May requesting a response from the CHI board to the report, on 18 June I wrote to the CHI board requesting assurance that the recommendations have been addressed in full. I also emphasised the priority I place on child patient safety issues and asked the board to report directly to me on the status of the children that may have been impacted. \n Deputy Sorca Clarke  There has been scandal after scandal at CHI. There were inappropriate spring implants, possibly hundreds of unnecessary hip surgeries and now a scathing leaked report of an examination of a clinical department at Crumlin hospital. The report has raised exceptionally serious concerns and it follows the Boston review, the HIQA review into unauthorised springs and the hip dysplasia audit. We would not know about the first two reports if it were not for whistleblowers who came forward, and the third report was released by HIQA. The approach from CHI has been unacceptable. It has stonewalled and refused to release the report in full. It has also refused to report the misuse of public funds to the Garda. The HSE took doing this into its own hands earlier this month. The HSE said CHI did not even share the report with it until after it was leaked. At a time when we hope to move into the new children's hospital in the coming two years, confidence and trust in CHI has never been lower. What steps is the Minister taking to address this? In terms of the new board members coming in, how does she intend to hold the previous board members to account? \n Deputy Jennifer Carroll MacNeill  The Deputy will note the number of resignations from the board. She has identified a series of important and serious issues, most of which we knew would be coming because of the concerns raised by whistleblowers and others. Reports were correctly commissioned with HIQA by the HSE and CHI. We knew they would come but, as she pointed out, the report that was not shared with either the HSE or the Department raises very serious concerns. It comes from 2022 when it should have been shared and addressed properly but it is today that we have to address it. I recognise that we have nearly a new board. We certainly have a new CEO who was appointed in February and is establishing an executive team around her, all of whom are new to the system. I will work directly with them to ensure this is taken forward. Of course I have stronger confidence because of the increased involvement of the HSE. There is ongoing reporting to me of what is happening about the implementation of the various issues. I am concerned in particular, of course, from a patient safety perspective. \n Deputy Sorca Clarke  There are still 226 children waiting on spinal surgery. Of these, 34 children have been waiting longer than six months. There are also many more who were removed from waiting lists because they were left for so long that they have become inoperable. One of these is a young lad called Mikey. He is from Mayo and is aged 16. He has severe scoliosis. Last September Mikey's parents were told by CHI that he is not fit for surgical intervention. The letter did not indicate any pathway for Mikey. His parents have asked many times for a second opinion abroad. Last month my colleague Deputy Conway-Walsh, who is from the county, raised this with the Taoiseach and he stated he was of the view that a second opinion should be facilitated. The family has had no update from CHI in this regard. Will the Minister make sure that Mikey and children like him get the second opinion they need? \n Deputy Jennifer Carroll MacNeill  I want to be very careful of the privacy of Mikey and his family but I have met him and I have met his family. I am aware of the various issues. On foot of meeting them, I put in train a process and perhaps I might speak to the Deputy about it privately rather than on the floor of the Dáil, recognising his privacy.  With regard to scoliosis and the issue of waiting times, it is a source of great frustration to me that there has been so much additional investment, both financial and personnel, into the system but we are not getting what I would regard as a commensurate increase in output or productivity. They sound like harsh words but I mean surgeries for children who need them. It is very important to look at the work the HSE internal auditor will do. The auditor will look at three specialisms, two of which will be surgical and one medical.  The auditor will examine the waiting list management within that, and I imagine that scoliosis will be one of those areas that will be examined. Again, I reiterate the importance of a central referral system, which manages it on behalf of the team, rather than individuals managing their own lists. ",

Service level agreements between CHI and the HSE have been strengthened, and a steering group has been established to oversee improvements. The 2022 internal review report cannot be published by the Minister due to legal reasons, but a summary has been released. The Minister has requested a response from CHI's board regarding the report's recommendations. A new CEO has been appointed, and the HSE has increased its oversight involvement. Additionally, the Minister is addressing concerns about children waiting for spinal surgery, including the case of a child named Mikey, by facilitating further investigation and ensuring appropriate action is taken."

        "answerText": " Deputy Marie Sherlock  As the Minister knows, the scheme for special leave for those who contracted long Covid is due to expire on in four days on 30 June. A total of 166 section 38 organisations and HSE employees are currently in receipt of this payment. To be frank, the response to date has been downright disrespectful and degrading to those who gave so much and risked so much at a time of such uncertainty and risk in this country. What plans has the Minister put in place and what actions has she taken to protect those health workers who have contracted long Covid? \n Deputy Jennifer Carroll MacNeill  I thank the Deputy.  The role our healthcare workers played during the pandemic cannot be overstated, particular at the very early stage of it. They went beyond the call of duty, working in front-line environments, treating Covid-19 positive patients, particularly in the early days when the control mechanisms were what they ultimately became and while the risk was extraordinarily great. In response to that, a temporary scheme was put in place for 12 months in July 2022 to support eligible staff who were impacted by long Covid in the public health sector. The intention of this scheme was to support those employees working in Covid-19 environments in the time before PPE and vaccinations were readily available. It is my understanding that approximately 159 employees are currently on the special scheme, the majority of whom have been supported on full pay for almost five years.  My Department has always worked hard to ensure supports have been in place for those workers impacted by long Covid. At the Department of Health's request, the now Department of Public Expenditure, Infrastructure, Public Service Reform and Digitalisation has agreed to extend the scheme on four occasions, most recently at the end of June 2024, when it was extended for a further 12 months for the existing group of employees being supported by it. However, I understand the Department of public expenditure was clear at the time that this was the final extension that would be granted. As such, the special scheme will conclude on 30 June 2025.  I reassure, to the extent that I can, those 159 employees who have been supported by the scheme for up to five years that they will continue to be supported. The full provisions of the public service sick leave scheme will apply for anyone who remains unable to return to work. The sick leave scheme provides full pay for three months and half pay for three months. This is followed by temporary rehabilitative remuneration, which can provide up to a further 547 days of paid leave. The critical illness protocol that forms part of the sick leave scheme may also provide additional supports for up to three years.  I am aware that concerns have been raised by a number of unions about the scheme ending, and I know that the matter was before the Labour Court on 11 June, the findings of which are currently awaited. \n Deputy Marie Sherlock  As the Minister knows, people's lives have been turned upside down by long Covid. This is not any ordinary type of illness. This was contracted in the workplace, yet there has been a persistent refusal by this State, in sharp contrast to the vast majority of EU member states, to recognise Covid as an occupational illness. The refusal to extend this scheme or to put in place a long-term framework for those who contracted Covid in the workplace reflects a shocking lack of empathy and respect for those workers. The reality is that the sick pay scheme currently in operation across the public service runs out after a period. As workers have described it to me, the special scheme has been a lifeline. There is a different pay calculation for that scheme relative to the ordinary sick pay scheme. The crucial point is that these workers have ultimately been told they are five years on and to get over it, but that is not their lived reality. \n Deputy Jennifer Carroll MacNeill  There is no intention not to recognise that or to not be empathetic, which is why the scheme for full pay was there for five years. I am aware that the Minister for Social Protection has reviewed the EU recommendation in respect of the recognition of Covid-19, not long Covid, for an occupational illness. Following that review, it was determined that Covid-19 did not meet the requirements to be recognised as an occupational illness in the context of the occupational injuries benefit scheme and the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005.  It is important to recognise that the EU advisory committee on health and safety recommended the recognition of Covid-19 and not long Covid as an occupational illness in health and social care settings. As I said, the Minister for Social Protection reviewed those recommendations and did not recognise it in the context of the occupational injuries benefit scheme. While many EU countries recognised Covid-19 as an occupational illness or injury, this related to Covid-19 and not long Covid. It is not clear that any country sustained full pay for workers suffering from long Covid in the same way Ireland has for its public health workers through the special scheme we have had to date. \n Deputy Marie Sherlock  With respect, the Government is splitting hairs in distinguishing between Covid-19 and long Covid. Clearly, long Covid resulted from Covid-19. The reality is that the request has been for a framework to be put in place to support these specific workers. We are only talking about health workers. We are not talking about gardaí or the many other front-line workers who went out to work during that period. The Government gave false hope last year that some sort of scheme would be put in place. Now those hopes have been dashed. It is shameful that people have had to go to the High Court and that unions have had to go to the Labour Court to try to get respect for those workers who contracted this illness in the workplace. My direct appeal to the Minister is that she ensures some sort of new scheme will be put in place in specific recognition of those workers, their experiences, their desire to get back to work and their need to be supported. The scheme should be separate from the sick pay scheme that exists in the health service. \n Deputy Jennifer Carroll MacNeill  Again, I recognise that the findings of the Labour Court are still awaited and I respect that. I will also reiterate the terms of the sick leave scheme. Having been on full pay for five years, the healthcare workers may receive further full pay for three months, half pay for three months, temporary rehabilitative remuneration for 547 days of paid leave and the critical illness protocol that forms part of the sick leave, which provides additional support for up to three years.  I appreciate the distinction, importantly, the Deputy has not made between Covid and long Covid. Nevertheless, when we look at the EU comparison, we are not aware of any case such as that. If the Deputy is aware of any case where any country sustained full pay for workers suffering from long Covid in the way Ireland did, I ask her to please bring it to me. We have tried to take an empathetic and supportive approach. The Minister for Social Protection has reviewed the EU position to determine how this works with the occupational injuries benefit scheme. The public service sick leave scheme is an important scheme in the context of supporting all people in the public service. ",

It is shameful that people have had to go to the High Court and that unions have had to go to the Labour Court to try to get respect for those workers who contracted this illness in the workplace. My direct appeal to the Minister is that she ensures some sort of new scheme will be put in place in specific recognition of those workers, their experiences, their desire to get back to work and their need to be supported. The scheme should be separate from the sick pay scheme that exists in the health service. \n Deputy Jennifer Carroll MacNeill  Again, I recognise that the findings of the Labour Court are still awaited and I respect that. I will also reiterate the terms of the sick leave scheme. Having been on full pay for five years, the healthcare workers may receive further full pay for three months, half pay for three months, temporary rehabilitative remuneration for 547 days of paid leave and the critical illness protocol that forms part of the sick leave, which provides additional support for up to three years.  I appreciate the distinction, importantly, the Deputy has not made between Covid and long Covid. Nevertheless, when we look at the EU comparison, we are not aware of any case such as that. If the Deputy is aware of any case where any country sustained full pay for workers suffering from long Covid in the way Ireland did, I ask her to please bring it to me. We have tried to take an empathetic and supportive approach. The Minister for Social Protection has reviewed the EU position to determine how this works with the occupational injuries benefit scheme. The public service sick leave scheme is an important scheme in the context of supporting all people in the public service.",
        "formatted_question": "What actions has the Minister for Health taken regarding the special leave scheme for healthcare workers with long Covid? Will the scheme be extended, and will long Covid be recognized as an occupational illness?",
        "formatted_answer": "The special leave scheme for healthcare workers with long Covid, initially set to expire on June 30, 2025, was extended four times, with the latest extension to June 2025. Currently, 159 public health sector employees are benefiting from this scheme. Post-scheme, the public service sick leave scheme will apply, offering full pay for three months, half pay for three months, temporary rehabilitative remuneration for up to 547 days, and a critical illness protocol for up to three years. The EU advisory committee recommended recognizing Covid-19, not long Covid, as an occupational illness. The Minister for Social Protection reviewed this and concluded Covid-19 doesn't meet the criteria for occupational illness under the specified schemes. Unions have raised concerns, and the Labour Court is reviewing the matter. The current sick leave scheme is separate from the special scheme and provides distinct terms."

        "answerText": " Deputy Charles Ward  It will be no surprise to the Minister what I am asking her today. The decision of where to locate the surgical hub in the north west is an important one. Therefore, transparency in the decision-making process is vital. Will she outline, in detail, what factors will be considered when choosing the surgical hub for the north west? \n Deputy Jennifer Carroll MacNeill  I thank the Deputy.  As part of the Government’s ambulatory care policy and in advance of the new elective hospitals, the HSE is developing surgical hubs across the regions. They will play an important role in separating scheduled and unscheduled care, reducing waiting times, thereby improving access and care for patients. The programme for Government committed to delivering six new hubs and exploring the provision of an additional surgical hub for the north west. No decision has yet been made on a location for this hub and the business case has not yet been submitted to my Department. I visited Letterkenny on 1 May to better see and understand the hospital and the supporting environs, such as the 110-bed community nursing unit across the way that is under construction and the excellent Errigal hub, which is also across the way from Letterkenny Hospital.  On 11 June, I believe I met with all Oireachtas Members for Donegal. Last week, I also met with representatives of doctors and consultants in Letterkenny, who have engaged with me very constructively and positively on this issue. It was a wide-ranging discussion, and I have committed to meet with them again soon. I am open to listening to them and to understanding the issues, which I share, regarding surgical capacity in Letterkenny in the medium and long term. I look forward to my next engagement with them to best determine the way to deliver health care for the people of the north west. \n Deputy Charles Ward  I thank the Minister for outlining that. The location of the surgical hub has generated a lot of public interest. It has the potential to impact many people's lives across the north west. It is important we get it right. As I said to the Minister, this is not a Sligo versus Donegal issue. The north-west region alone is disadvantaged in many ways. We should not be forced to fight over squeezed resources. Ideally, to address the imbalance in healthcare and to meet the current demand, two surgical hubs should be established. All I can say, as someone who has worked on the ground in Donegal, is that the case for a surgical hub in Letterkenny is overwhelming. Donegal consultants and GPs who met with the Minister last week outlined this. I am asking her to take their experiences and all the data presented into account. The public needs reassurance that the decision will be data-driven and free from influence. \n Deputy Jennifer Carroll MacNeill  I thank Deputy Ward and I assure him, representatives from Donegal, the consultants and doctors in Letterkenny and the people of Donegal more broadly that I will do precisely that. I am committed to that region. That is why I visited it a number of weeks into becoming Minister for Health in order to understand for myself. I cannot look at it on a map or look at drawings. I have to be there to understand the dynamics and to listen to people, which is precisely why I went and have tried to engage in this way. No decision has been made yet. I ask Deputy Ward to give me a little bit more time to work out how to manage this.  I wish to update the House on the operation of the surgical hubs. I was in St. James's Hospital yesterday. To update the House, the surgical hub that has opened in Mount Carmel Community Hospital has seen 1,000 patients already. The CEO of St. James's Hospital informs me that its pain relief list is nearly clear because they are able to give pain injections. The surgical hubs are really important.  In respect of what Deputy Ward describes, I know and respect the geography of Donegal. It is important we have capacity there to deliver these different services. I ask Deputy Ward to allow me a little bit of time. I am trying to work on it. \n Deputy Charles Ward  I thank the Minister for her engagement on this matter. She has been proactive and committed to ensure that all the data and experiences are being taken into account. We appreciate this. In Donegal, we are grateful the Minister is listening to us. We are fighting our corner and are willing to listen. The Minister is taking all the situations into account. We appreciate and understand that.  All the TDs in Donegal are united on this matter. We are disappointed and honestly shocked that the HSE decided no consideration be given to Letterkenny for the surgical hub, despite overwhelming data presented to it, including the geographic population, demographics, day case numbers and staffing numbers of the hospital. It is hard not to feel a bit despondent when faced with this. I truly appreciate the Minister's consideration and I look forward to engaging with her in the future on this matter. \n Deputy Jennifer Carroll MacNeill  I thank Deputy Ward and I hear what he is saying about his experience of the HSE. That is important. It is also important to reflect on local hospital management and their responsibility to advance cases on behalf of the hospital. When I met Deputies from Donegal, I went through the projects that had been advanced and supported. I recognised there was, in my view, insufficient surgical ask by the local hospital management. While I am not trying to deflect from the surgical hub issue in any sense, it is also important there is a real development control plan for Letterkenny University Hospital for the medium and long term in the way that has been successful in Galway and other places. I strongly urge Deputies to pressure for and demand this sort of approach for Letterkenny. However, do not allow me in any way to attempt to confuse that with the specific surgical hub issue, which is more pressing and immediate. ",

        "answerText": " Deputy Jennifer Carroll MacNeill  The GP chronic disease management programme commenced in 2020 and has been rolled out on a phased basis over four years to adults with either a medical card or, for GMS patients, a GP visit card. The aim of the programme is to prevent and manage chronic diseases. Since 2020, over 680,000 patients have been registered on the programme, including those who have exited the programme. Some 91% of patients now receive routine care in community settings, reducing their reliance on hospitals. An ICGP study found that for patients enrolled in the treatment programme, there were 30% fewer emergency department attendances, 26% fewer hospital admissions and 33% fewer GP out-of-hours attendances compared with their pre-enrolment rates.  The majority of patients manage their conditions through the GP chronic disease management programme. In addition, the 26 operational community specialist teams for chronic disease management, linking the care pathways between acute and community services, are delivering services from integrated care hubs located in or adjacent to primary care centres. They are fantastic. In 2024, over 354,000 patient contacts were provided by community specialist teams for chronic disease management, about 55% ahead of target, and this year to the end of quarter 1, 108,000 patient contacts had already been provided by these teams, which is about 30% ahead of target.  The conditions covered by the programme are type 2 diabetes; asthma; chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, COPD; and cardiovascular disease. The treatment programme supports patients in managing their chronic conditions. Patients receive two reviews in a 12-month period, with each review including a practice nurse and a GP visit. GMS patients over 45 years of age found to be at high risk of cardiovascular disease or diabetes are enrolled in the prevention programme and receive one annual review. The prevention programme was expanded from 30 November 2023 to include adult GMS patients with hypertension and all women who have had a diagnosis of gestational diabetes or pre-eclampsia since 1 January 2023. \n Deputy Naoise Ó Muirí  I am looking at this programme and it seems to be a quiet success story for the HSE. We hear very little about it. The Minister mentioned statistics regarding fewer presentations at emergency departments. That is a very good measure of success. The Minister mentioned some additional conditions that will be brought into it. I think she mentioned hypertension. It would be useful to have that list.  I see from the HSE's report that the overall uptake is pretty good but it is probably behind for younger sufferers, mainly because it has not been open to them for as long. Are there plans to promote it or make those patients aware they have this option? It is a very good option for those patients. \n Deputy Jennifer Carroll MacNeill  That is right. It impacts early detection as well. As populations age - which ours is doing - the prevalence of chronic conditions, including multimorbidity, rises. Early protection through the chronic disease management programme prevents the need for more intensive hospital-based treatments. Since 2020, 51% of the new chronic disease diagnoses have been made through elements of this programme. It is not just treating more effectively; it is diagnosing more effectively and being able to divert attention to prevention and early intervention.  As regards expansion of the scheme, a further expansion of the programme to include chronic kidney disease is planned for the end of the year, and further expansion would include rigorous clinical assessment and engagement with stakeholders. Not all chronic conditions can be managed in that way and it is important to recognise the capacity of general practice and how we are trying to grow general practice at the same time. I have listed a number of conditions but I also want to flag that, for example, the Benbulbin hub in Sligo treats a range of different illnesses and it is separate from the hospital, and again and again, prevents hospital attendances.

The aim of the programme is to prevent and manage chronic diseases. Since 2020, over 680,000 patients have been registered on the programme, including those who have exited the programme. Some 91% of patients now receive routine care in community settings, reducing their reliance on hospitals. An ICGP study found that for patients enrolled in the treatment programme, there were 30% fewer emergency department attendances, 26% fewer hospital admissions and 33% fewer GP out-of-hours attendances compared with their pre-enrolment rates.  The majority of patients manage their conditions through the GP chronic disease management programme. In addition, the 26 operational community specialist teams for chronic disease management, linking the care pathways between acute and community services, are delivering services from integrated care hubs located in or adjacent to primary care centres. They are fantastic. In 2024, over 354,000 patient contacts were provided by community specialist teams for chronic disease management, about 55% ahead of target, and this year to the end of quarter 1, 108,000 patient contacts had already been provided by these teams, which is about 30% ahead of target.  The conditions covered by the programme are type 2 diabetes; asthma; chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, COPD; and cardiovascular disease. The treatment programme supports patients in managing their chronic conditions. Patients receive two reviews in a 12-month period, with each review including a practice nurse and a GP visit. GMS patients over 45 years of age found to be at high risk of cardiovascular disease or diabetes are enrolled in the prevention programme and receive one annual review. The prevention programme was expanded from 30 November 2023 to include adult GMS patients with hypertension and all women who have had a diagnosis of gestational diabetes or pre-eclampsia since 1 January 2023. \n Deputy Naoise Ó Muirí  I am looking at this programme and it seems to be a quiet success story for the HSE. We hear very little about it. The Minister mentioned statistics regarding fewer presentations at emergency departments. That is a very good measure of success. The Minister mentioned some additional conditions that will be brought into it. I think she mentioned hypertension. It would be useful to have that list.  I see from the HSE's report that the overall uptake is pretty good but it is probably behind for younger sufferers, mainly because it has not been open to them for as long. Are there plans to promote it or make those patients aware they have this option? It is a very good option for those patients. \n Deputy Jennifer Carroll MacNeill  That is right. It impacts early detection as well. As populations age - which ours is doing - the prevalence of chronic conditions, including multimorbidity, rises. Early protection through the chronic disease management programme prevents the need for more intensive hospital-based treatments. Since 2020, 51% of the new chronic disease diagnoses have been made through elements of this programme. It is not just treating more effectively; it is diagnosing more effectively and being able to divert attention to prevention and early intervention.  As regards expansion of the scheme, a further expansion of the programme to include chronic kidney disease is planned for the end of the year, and further expansion would include rigorous clinical assessment and engagement with stakeholders. Not all chronic conditions can be managed in that way and it is important to recognise the capacity of general practice and how we are trying to grow general practice at the same time. I have listed a number of conditions but I also want to flag that, for example, the Benbulbin hub in Sligo treats a range of different illnesses and it is separate from the hospital, and again and again, prevents hospital attendances.",
        "formatted_question": "What is the current status of the chronic disease management program? How many patients are enrolled? Will the Minister make a statement on this?",
        "formatted_answer": "The chronic disease management program began in 2020, rolling out over four years to adults with a medical card or GP visit card. It aims to prevent and manage chronic diseases. Over 680,000 patients have been registered, including those who have left the program. Currently, 91% of participants receive care in community settings, reducing hospital visits. Studies indicate a 30% decrease in emergency department visits, 26% fewer hospital admissions, and 33% fewer GP out-of-hours visits post-enrollment. The program covers type 2 diabetes, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and cardiovascular disease. Enrolled patients receive two annual reviews, each involving a practice nurse and a GP visit. The prevention component targets GMS patients over 45 at high risk, and it was expanded to include hypertension and gestational diabetes patients. Plans are in place to add chronic kidney disease to the program by the end of the year."

The Health (Assisted Human Reproduction) Act 2024 was signed into law by the President in July 2024, having passed all stages in both Houses of the Oireachtas.  This will introduce specific regulation of the AHR sector in this country for the first time and also includes internationally ground-breaking provisions in respect of surrogacy.  While the AHR Act 2024 was progressing through the Houses of Oireachtas, issues were identified which required further consideration and consultation with the Office of the Attorney General.  Accordingly, in October 2024 the Government approved the drafting of a Bill, the Health (Assisted Human Reproduction) (Amendment) Bill, to legislate for provisions in respect of these issues, as well as making other necessary changes to the AHR Act 2024. Formal drafting of the Bill has been intensive and is now at an advanced stage, led by the Office of Parliamentary Counsel, in conjunction with officials from my Department, the Department of Justice, Home Affairs and Migration, and the Department of Children, Disability and Equality.  Full commencement of the 2024 AHR Act will also require a fully established and operational Assisted Human Reproduction Regulatory Authority (AHRRA) being in place.

        "answerText": " Deputy Ruairí Ó Murchú  I want to ask the Minister the mechanism by which parents whose children are deemed to need hip dysplasia surgery at CHI hospitals such as Temple Street and Cappagh will be able to get independent second opinions by experts of their choosing, paid for by the HSE? I have spoken to the Minister on this previously and I believe she was working with Bernard Gloster on finding a solution to this issue, which is absolutely necessary. \n Deputy Jennifer Carroll MacNeill  I agree completely with the Deputy. However, my immediate priority is to ensure that there is clinical follow-up and care for patients who have undergone pelvic osteotomy surgery in accordance with the recommendations of the Thomas audit report. I am very aware that there are families around Ireland who are receiving letters and follow-up to say that surgery was not necessary on their child. I cannot imagine the distress that those families experience when they receive that sort of communication. I have spoken to families who are having that experience and it is so utterly distressing for them.  Clinical follow-up to skeletal maturity for children in CHI Crumlin, CHI Temple Street and the National Orthopaedic Hospital Cappagh, NOHC, is already under way for patients. These children have been identified and categorised by age, with a proportion of them being close to skeletal maturity and likely to need just one appointment. The clinic is structured as a one-stop multidisciplinary team model for assessment, and that includes consultation with a doctor, a physiotherapy assessment, an X-ray, if clinically indicated, and immediate documentation of findings. After this, patients enter the recommended normal follow-up process.  As of Monday, 23 June 2025, 115 appointments have been offered to CHI and NOHC patients. A total of 86 patients have been booked and 71 patients have been seen so far. Patients who request attendance at another hospital or with another consultant will have their request facilitated by CHI. It is important to say that the consultant who did the surgery is not the one who is doing the review, in the clinical follow-up. I will get to the expert review as well. I just want to make sure that this is on the record.  In relation to the retrospective reviews of cases, which is the second process, to determine the indications for surgery and whether they were warranted, the HSE is establishing a separate process, involving external experts. Professor Deborah McNamara, the president of RCSI, has agreed to assist the HSE in establishing the expert panel and terms of reference.  I have more information for the Deputy on that. \n Deputy Ruairí Ó Murchú  I do not think anyone will disagree with the assertion that we have had an absolute disaster and failure around children's care. Many have gone through operations they did not need. We need to deal with those children and make sure they are reviewed correctly and properly from a medical point of view and that they get the correct pathways afterwards.  I bring it up and brought it up before because I am thinking of a case in my constituency. A mam has three kids, two of whom had the operation. She has the question mark over their care, whether they needed the operations and all those terrible questions she is dealing with. She has another child who was to have an operation. We are talking about osteotomies. Her issue previously was it was delayed. Most people would believe what a medical expert tells them about whether an operation is needed. \n Deputy Sorca Clarke  I thank my colleague for tabling this question. We recently had CHI and the HSE in the committee on this issue. In the Gallery were representatives of the hip dysplasia advocacy group. Afterwards, I met one of those dads in the car park, a young dad and an awful nice guy. He was in a ball of tears. I do not know this man. I had never met him before and he had never met me. That is the level of distress these parents are under - crying to a perfect stranger in the car park of Leinster House. It is not something I ever thought I would see or something I ever want to see again.  I ask the Minister for two things. First, will she meet with the hip dysplasia advocacy group? Second, the HSE gave me a commitment that day to make all supports available to the parents. I ask that each and every one of them be offered psychology or counselling supports, given the level of distress these parents are under. \n Deputy Jennifer Carroll MacNeill  My practice, as much as I possibly can, is to meet people. Like Deputy Clarke, I have met parents and seen the distress. I have parents in my constituency in this situation. There is no difference between our experiences of this. I cannot believe the distress being experienced by the parents of the 71 children. We are already identifying children. Parents are being told through this initial clinical follow-up that their child did not need this.  I will now update the Deputies on the expert review process to follow. We are in the process of establishing that panel. It is not complete but there are a number of experts from Canada and the United Kingdom. It is not surgeons within the system; it is very different. The clinical review follow-up, the first process, is expected to take about six months and for the secondary review panel, the independent expert one, it will take until September for the establishment of the team. We have four at the moment and there are a number of others to come. They need to agree the terms of reference; it is not for us to impose the terms of reference on them. They can assess each case as appropriate once they have begun. \n Deputy Ruairí Ó Murchú  I appreciate the timelines. The clinical review is six months and the Minister is saying it is September for the expert review process. The terms of reference are not set. We would like to think this will deal with the issue of the considerable timeline that would need to be taken into account, the huge number of cases and the disparity. In the case of my constituent, can we find a process to ensure she can get the follow-up care for her daughters and can get an independent review she can trust in relation to her other child, who has been told she needs surgery? Trust is at an all-time low in relation to CHI. We need this work done as soon as possible. I ask the Minister to take into account many of the cases we have brought forward, particularly the parents who got reviews and, on that basis, did not go ahead with operations. I brought an issue like that to the Minister previously. \n Deputy Jennifer Carroll MacNeill  I do not know the exact details of the Deputy's constituent's case but for any child now indicated for surgery, the assessment is done in a very different way from how it happened before. Any such assessment is done by a multidisciplinary team, including a doctor. It is a cross-site piece of work including a physiotherapist assessment. It is not, as had been the case, that an individual consultant makes decisions in his or her own bubble. This is a multidisciplinary team. The Deputy's constituent or any Deputy's constituent who has a child indicated for surgery can, depending on the timing, get the assessment through the multidisciplinary team. It is very different from what was there before. I hope that will give her more confidence where she has questions relating to her child.  I agree with Deputy Clarke on counselling and psychological supports. Parents who take the advice of clinicians do so in the best interests of their child and now feel they have done something wrong in following that advice. It is a devastating thing to happen to a parent who is only trying to be a good parent and take the right decisions. They need support as much as their children do. I totally recognise that. ",

        "answerText": " Deputy Ruairí Ó Murchú  This is a particular issue and there is huge cohort, in particular in the Louth hospital in Dundalk. Those with grade 4 issues were dealt with but those with grade 5 issues, which were more serious, were not. Obviously, the longer we leave this the greater an issue it is. It needs to be dealt with. \n Deputy Jennifer Carroll MacNeill  I can update the Deputy on the orthodontic waiting lists. As of April 2025, the HSE employs 14 consultant orthodontists and 36 specialist orthodontists nationally. There are almost 35 oral healthcare vacancies at the moment which the HSE is working to fill, including three specialist orthodontist whole-time equivalents, and a further 2.22 dental nurse whole-time equivalents. There are staffing challenges within orthodontic services in the Dublin and north-east region.  At present, both specialist orthodontists posts in Dundalk, which also serve Counties Cavan and Monaghan, are vacant. The HSE is sanctioned to fill those posts and is actively pursuing both temporary and permanent recruitment options. A locum consultant orthodontist post is also being considered. The region also has orthodontic units in Navan and Ashtown, which have a combined total of two consultant orthodontists and five specialist orthodontist whole-time equivalents, currently filled and providing care in the Dublin and north-east region. The HSE is engaged to address the best use of existing funded private procurement options to support delivery of orthodontic care in the region. \n Deputy Ruairí Ó Murchú  Gabhaim buíochas leis an Aire. Could the Minister come back to me regarding the waiting list initiative? We have submitted multiple parliamentary questions on this. This was one of the solutions. There had been a huge number of vacancies. It is positive that attempts are being made to fill these positions but we need to make sure it happens as soon as possible. I saw movement on those who were seen as grade 4 patients and who needed that orthodontic dental work done, but my fear is that those who fall into the grade 5 bracket have a greater medical need and the longer they are left, the greater the issues there may be. I accept the Minister might not have the answer in front of her, but I would appreciate it if she could come back to me with the specifics of this initiative to deal with the waiting lists. We need to make sure there is no hold up and slow down in filling these vacancies related to orthodontic services because the impact this could have could be serious. \n Deputy Jennifer Carroll MacNeill  I totally recognise that and I commit today to writing to the Deputy with a full answer on these points. However, as regards the waiting list initiative, there is €8.4 million for this year, provided on an ongoing basis this year to address the primary care waiting lists for children, including in orthodontics. The funding is ongoing rather than one-off and is provided to try to reduce the waiting lists and address increased demand for those services. In the area of orthodontics in 2025, €1.35 million is to be invested in the jaw surgery initiative, while €1.5 million is to be invested in the community-based treatment initiative. Up to the end of May, 128 patients had been transferred to private orthodontic treatment, with 33 receiving jaw surgery under that initiative. A higher number of grade 5 patients are commencing, progressing and completing treatment than grade 4, and I recognise the very serious impact that has, particularly on young people, and the need for timely surgery. I will come back to the Deputy with a complete and full answer. \n Deputy Ruairí Ó Murchú  I appreciate the Minister's response. We need information on timelines and tenders so that we can see light at the end of the tunnel in terms of delivering for those patients. The Minister accepts that we are talking about those with the most serious orthodontic need. The sooner that happens, the better. Otherwise we could be talking about people who need far more acute care, which will be a cost to them and their families and to the State. We need to ensure these initiatives, which have been promised, are up and running and work as soon as possible, while ensuring that those vacancies that exist in respect of orthodontic services, particularly in the Dublin and north-east region, are dealt with.

Government is committed to progressing cardiac services at University Hospital Waterford (UHW) and has invested significantly in providing the resources required to support the delivery of enhanced and extended cardiac services.  Construction projects with a total cost of €64 million have been completed at University Hospital Waterford. Part of this investment has been a significant focus on developing cardiac services, particularly cardiac catheterisation laboratory services at the Hospital.  In 2018, a second cardiac catheterisation laboratory was approved for University Hospital Waterford. The second Cath Lab opened on 4th of September 2023 and operates 5 days per week Monday to Friday, 8am-6pm. 24 posts were provided to support the opening of the second cath lab.  In September 2022, the opening hours for the original cath lab were extended to 8 am – 8 pm, Monday to Friday. In March 2024, the Government announced provision for 19.5 staff in total to complement existing services and to extend the opening hours of one Cardiac Cath Lab at University Hospital Waterford to a seven day, 8.00am – 8.00pm service. After a successful recruitment campaign and discussions with the clinical teams, the 7-day service went live on March 18th, 2025.  I commend the collaborative advocacy of local TDs from across the political spectrum, along with the tireless efforts of local patient groups and staff.  The final step in service expansion is the introduction of a full 24/7 out-of-hours emergency cardiac service. I am pleased to confirm that I have directed the HSE to progress this.

The policy recognises the need for a whole-of-government approach to the delivery of mental health services and supports, making mental health everybody's business, not just that of the Department of Health or the HSE.

        "answerText": " Deputy Jennifer Carroll MacNeill  On 19 June, CHI advised the Joint Committee on Health that neither Temple Street nor Crumlin hospitals accepted the Dickson report when it was completed in 2017. My Department received a copy of the report on Friday, 20 June and my officials are reviewing it. I will be seeking assurance from CHI that the matters raised in the report have been addressed.  In light of concerns raised in relation to corporate and clinical governance concerns at CHI, as the Deputy is aware, I have appointed two HSE board members to the CHI board. We discussed yesterday the changes to the service level agreement, the role of the HSE and the internal audit being conducted by the HSE. I do not wish to disrespect the Deputy by repeating those issues he already knows about, but all of those governance changes are being made with a view to supporting the new CEO as she continues to establish her executive team. She needs to implement the recommendations of a range of different reports and at the same time take CHI forward in a constructive and positive way towards the new hospital but also towards the delivery of better paediatric services across this country.  On the Deputy's direct question around the Dickson report, my Department received it on Friday, 20 June and is reviewing it. I can engage with the Deputy further on it. \n Deputy Pádraig Rice  A number of patient advocacy groups and parents have for a long time been calling for this report to be published. I urge the Minister to consider that and to consider publishing that report along with the others. What we have seen time and again from CHI are issues around transparency, accountability and a reluctance to release information, and we have had to drag that information from the organisation, which is deeply concerning.  It indicates to me that the culture in the organisation is not changing. This is another example of it. Last week we raised the internal investigation with CHI. Its officials told the Joint Committee on Health they would provide us with the legal advice on that internal investigation. We have not received that legal advice from them. CHI did publish a summary, as the Minister mentioned. Is it her view that that summary of the internal investigation is a true reflection of the full report? \n Deputy Jennifer Carroll MacNeill  I could say about the summary that it is CHI's view that this is the best it can do, recognising some of the HR and legal constraints. I want to see the report published in the broader public interest but it is not necessarily the case that in every instance it should be published. In particular, I am concerned that this was a HR report where people who might be constituents of the Deputy, and for whom he might take a protective trade union perspective as well, participated in a process to try to address a significant cultural issue. It would be very difficult for those people to talk about the experiences they had in this HR process and for their comments to be published in the public domain. While we are trying to get to the issues relating to culture and to governance, I understand the difficulty there for those individuals and CHI's perspective on that.  In relation to the legal advice, in general that is a matter for CHI and the committee directly. \n Deputy Pádraig Rice  I thank the Minister. There are ways of publishing these reports that anonymise the individuals and redact information that is key but then provide full transparency and accountability because trust in this organisation is now at an all-time low. Families are deeply concerned. We need more information released and more publications. Sunlight is a good disinfectant and CHI has been at every stage reluctant to release information to us.  I also raise concerns about some of the answers to parliamentary questions we are getting from CHI. Its officials are reluctant to answer reasonable questions we are putting to them. I have no doubt they will be before the health committee again. We have a long list of questions to put to CHI. I have concerns around the pace at which the culture is changing. It seems to me that culture change is not happening quickly enough. That reluctance to release information persists and we have seen that time and again with report after report and the one referenced here is another example of that. \n Deputy Jennifer Carroll MacNeill  I very much respect the Deputy's perspective on that and on the culture piece. I had a good meeting with the new CEO, Lucy Nugent, where I was very clear and reiterated that this is a new CHI for the future with a new executive management team, a new approach and a new culture. She needs that team around her to be able to implement that new culture. She is coming from Tallaght, where there has been good success and where she has a very strong track record in relation to that. I take the Deputy's perspective on the response to parliamentary questions and other matters very importantly and seriously. There is never a difficulty in being forthcoming with information to the extent that it is appropriate legally and from that HR perspective but there is a way in which you can lean in and provide better confidence.  I would be careful with phrases such as \"confidence is on the floor\". People are attending Crumlin and Temple Street hospitals today. I was there last week. I have a lot of confidence in the medical team there. I have a lot of confidence in the nurse specialists who listened to my voicemail and rang me back and the service and support I receive. That is the majority experience of Crumlin and Temple Street. There is a very important set of problems that we have to address but the majority experience is positive. I have parents contacting me to continue to make that point about their experience. This is parents and children at very vulnerable moments going in to receive hospital care and they are getting it.  We have a body of work together as a Legislature but we just need to be careful about the experience that they are having as well to make sure that we are reflecting it in a universal way. ",

The report shows that as our population grows and ages over the next 15 years, and as we continue to provide more services in the community, we need to continue to increase our general practice workforce to meet the resulting additional demand for general practice consultations.  Work is ongoing to increase the number of GPs practising throughout the country. In recent years significant additional investment has been provided to general practice under the 2019 and 2023 Agreements. This has provided for increase fees for GPs, increased practice supports, and the introduction of new services.  The number of new entrants to GP training has been increased by 80 percent over just five years from 2019 to 2024, with 350 places available from 2024. The total number of doctors undertaking GP training has grown as a result, as has the number of GP graduates which will continue to grow over next few years. In addition, 118 doctors are currently in practice here under the International Medical Graduate Rural GP programme, with 18 having completed the new 2-year programme.  While GPs are private practitioners, and as such determine the location they practice from, as well as their own staffing requirements, supports for practices in rural and urban deprived areas have been increased, as have supports for hiring practice staff.  The ongoing Strategic Review of General Practice, due to be completed this year, will also help our planning for general practice capacity and for the wider sustainability of GP services. ",

The report shows that as our population grows and ages over the next 15 years, and as we continue to provide more services in the community, we need to continue to increase our general practice workforce to meet the resulting additional demand for general practice consultations.  Work is ongoing to increase the number of GPs practising throughout the country. In recent years significant additional investment has been provided to general practice under the 2019 and 2023 Agreements. This has provided for increase fees for GPs, increased practice supports, and the introduction of new services.  The number of new entrants to GP training has been increased by 80 percent over just five years from 2019 to 2024, with 350 places available from 2024. The total number of doctors undertaking GP training has grown as a result, as has the number of GP graduates which will continue to grow over next few years. In addition, 118 doctors are currently in practice here under the International Medical Graduate Rural GP programme, with 18 having completed the new 2-year programme.  While GPs are private practitioners, and as such determine the location they practice from, as well as their own staffing requirements, supports for practices in rural and urban deprived areas have been increased, as have supports for hiring practice staff.  The ongoing Strategic Review of General Practice, due to be completed this year, will also help our planning for general practice capacity and for the wider sustainability of GP services.",

This dynamic is further compounded by evolving workforce expectations, which demand greater flexibility, agility and innovation in how we attract and retain staff.  In response, the HSE has increased its overall workforce by more than 3,000 WTEs since 2023 through a range of strategic initiatives. Our focus remains on identifying and implementing opportunities not only to attract and recruit talent, but also to develop, engage and retain a highly skilled workforce capable of delivering safe, high quality care to patients, service users and their families across acute, community and residential care settings.  The HSE has a number of initiatives to maximise this valuable candidate pool. All nursing / midwifery graduates and health and social care professional graduates in key priority areas have been offered permanent contracts of employment in our health service in advance of their graduation and subsequent registration with the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Ireland (NMBI) and CORU. Every support and encouragement is being afforded to these graduates to encourage them towards employment in the Irish health services.  This approach is important not only to the supply into our health service from our domestic labour market, but also for our graduates, as it signals ahead of their graduation the roles and careers available to them in our health service.  As the implementation of Sláintecare progresses and global competition for healthcare talent intensifies, the HSE is focusing on initiatives that address both current and future organisational need. The HSE Career Hub (https://careerhub.hse.ie/) provides a portal allowing candidates to access information about the organization, our regions, our culture, career pathways and services that are spotlighted to enhance their profile.  To build a sustainable and diverse talent pipeline, the HSE has implemented a range of targeted attraction measures, including:  • Graduate engagement through tailored webinars and follow up communication with all nursing, midwifery and HSCP graduates post qualification.  • Delivery of webinars aimed at both domestic and international candidates to enhance visibility of opportunities within the health service.  • The development of virtual career fairs, the first of these had a specific focus on attracting staff to Disability Services.  • The expansion of apprenticeship programmes for HSCP roles, designed to reach under-represented populations reflective of the diversity of the communities we serve.  • Strategic profiling of specific services and professions on the HSE Career Hub.  • Use of a broad range of media platforms, including LinkedIn, to promote high priority vacancies.  • Ongoing collaboration with CORU to streamline recognition and registration processes for international applicants.  • Proactive engagement with second and third level education providers and the Institute of Guidance Counsellors, to raise awareness of careers within the HSE and its partner organisations.  • Provision of sponsorship for nursing and HSCP students as part of the long term workforce development strategy.  • Supports for international recruits, including relocation packages and onboarding assistance, to facilitate a smooth transition into the Irish health system.  In addition to our attraction strategies the HSE is progressing a number of retention focused actions, including:  • The development of a comprehensive HSE Retention Toolkit to support services develop local retention strategies.  • A review of flexible working arrangements and work life balance policies to align with evolving staff needs and expectations.  • Continued development of structured career pathways to support professional growth and long term service within the organisation.  • Ongoing investment in learning and development opportunities for our existing staff.

The Department commissioned the ESRI as part of the Department of Health-ESRI ‘Joint Research Programme in Healthcare Reform’ to develop this modelling capability and support the Department through a new Capacity Review to inform longer-term strategic planning.  The ESRI has built out their Hippocrates projection model that provides base year estimates and projections of demand, capacity and expenditure. The Hippocrates model is a tool that can: inform health and social service planning in Ireland; inform financial planning for the healthcare system; inform planning for capacity, services and staffing; identify future demand pressures; and provide a framework in which to analyse the effects of potential system changes and reforms.  The Hippocrates projection modelling estimates activity rates on a 2023 baseline by age and sex and taking into account utilisation of services. Demand is then projected by multiplying activity rates by projected population in 2040 to align with the National Planning Framework. Various assumptions and scenarios are applied to give a range of projections for services and bed capacity. These findings will make our planning process more responsive to new data, evidence, and policies as they emerge, helping to inform future policy decisions and interventions.  The Capacity Review will not be a one-off stand-alone piece of work, but rather the Hippocrates projection model will be developed over time to allow for the inclusion of future additional data (e.g. census 2026) and policy considerations as required, to produce regular capacity projections in the future.  The ESRI report on public acute hospitals highlights the capacity challenges we face in meeting the needs of our growing and ageing population. Increasing bed numbers and the necessary resources and workforce will require careful long-term planning. We are already making significant strides to increase patient capacity. Between 2020 and 2024, the Health Service opened 1,218 new acute inpatient beds, and the Programme for Government has committed to continue to deliver much needed acute in-patient bed capacity. With unprecedented uplift in funding and workforce increases in recent years, we are targeting future capital investment where it is needed most. Indeed, the Hospital In-Patient Bed Capacity Plan published in 2024 aligns with the review by ESRI and funding of this capacity is being considered in the context of the National Development Plan review underway.  While it sets out projected capacity ranges, the ESRI’s report also considers health policies that reduce potential demand. Investing in improved population health, increased productivity, reducing avoidable hospitalisations and moving care into the community will help us make the best use of acute in-patient bed capacity to meet future demand.

To provide the supports to enable every individual to achieve their personal best oral health; and  2. To reduce oral health inequalities across the population, by enabling vulnerable people to access oral healthcare and improve their oral health.  Budget 2025 allocated €2m for 2025, increasing to €4m in 2026, to continue the implementation of the National Oral Health Policy. The implementation plan for the first phase of policy rollout to end-2027 is being finalised by my Department and the HSE, following targeted consultation in Q3 2024. Once published, the plan will set out the priorities for this first phase of implementation, which include reform of services for adults and children.  This Budget 2025 investment is also supporting the recruitment of an additional 15 HSE oral healthcare staff to deliver oral healthcare in the community for children and for adult medical card holders with additional needs, thereby supporting access to the current model of service while policy implementation proceeds.  The Policy also contains a range of strategic workforce planning actions to increase national workforce capacity, in support of improving patient access to care. My Department has recently finalised a workforce census framework for oral healthcare and work is progressing on a scoping project for a mid-level professional grade for oral healthcare, as an additional measure to increase capacity in the workforce. A programme to encourage the redistribution of oral healthcare professionals to underserved areas is also a key action in the Policy. For oral healthcare professionals working in isolated rural areas far away from centres of education, it will be essential to provide support in the form of mentoring programmes as well as by introducing long-distance and accessible continuing development education programmes.

        "extracted_answer": "Minister for Health  The National Oral Health Policy, Smile Agus Sláinte , sets out the vision for oral healthcare services in Ireland and has two key goals:  1. To provide the supports to enable every individual to achieve their personal best oral health; and  2. To reduce oral health inequalities across the population, by enabling vulnerable people to access oral healthcare and improve their oral health.  Budget 2025 allocated €2m for 2025, increasing to €4m in 2026, to continue the implementation of the National Oral Health Policy. The implementation plan for the first phase of policy rollout to end-2027 is being finalised by my Department and the HSE, following targeted consultation in Q3 2024. Once published, the plan will set out the priorities for this first phase of implementation, which include reform of services for adults and children.  This Budget 2025 investment is also supporting the recruitment of an additional 15 HSE oral healthcare staff to deliver oral healthcare in the community for children and for adult medical card holders with additional needs, thereby supporting access to the current model of service while policy implementation proceeds.  The Policy also contains a range of strategic workforce planning actions to increase national workforce capacity, in support of improving patient access to care. My Department has recently finalised a workforce census framework for oral healthcare and work is progressing on a scoping project for a mid-level professional grade for oral healthcare, as an additional measure to increase capacity in the workforce. A programme to encourage the redistribution of oral healthcare professionals to underserved areas is also a key action in the Policy. For oral healthcare professionals working in isolated rural areas far away from centres of education, it will be essential to provide support in the form of mentoring programmes as well as by introducing long-distance and accessible continuing development education programmes.",

        "answerText": " Minister for Health  I thank the Deputy for creating this opportunity for me to provide an update on the ongoing work within my Department to increase Clinical Trials in Ireland. The National Clinical Trials Oversight Group (NCTOG) was set up in July 2024 to investigate the challenges of undertaking clinical trials in Ireland, and to formulate solutions to meet those challenges. The Group published its interim recommendations in October 2024, and these were noted by Government on 7th November 2024.  As a focused group of experts in the area of clinical trials of investigational medicinal products, the NCTOG is well-placed to make recommendations that will have a transformative impact on the clinical trials landscape in Ireland, helping improve access to life-saving cutting-edge medicines and ultimately providing better patient outcomes. I had the pleasure of meeting with them in February, and their commitment to achieve these core objectives is clearly evident.  The NCTOG's Interim Recommendations directly address core administrative barriers hindering our clinical trial capabilities. Improvements in areas such as contracts, costings, and data protection are already evident, signaling that we are on the right track in looking to boost our competitiveness as a premier destination for high-quality clinical trials.  In the area of streamlining clinical trials agreements, a revised Clinical Trial Agreement contract template has been created by the HSE in partnership with the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association. This is now in use at HSE hospitals, and thanks to the efforts of the NCTOG, discussions are underway to implement these contracts more widely across our healthcare system. These solutions are being applied in real-world settings, and users are reporting that it is improving the speed at which contracted parties can reach agreement to undertake clinical trials and thus provide the potential for better patient outcomes.  This measurable progress has also been noted by the recent \"Clinical Trials Activity Comparison Report\" published by the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association (IPHA) in May 2025 which highlighted encouraging trends across Ireland's clinical trial landscape.   Key Findings from the IPHA Report:   • Increase in Trials: There was a 34% increase in the number of pharmaceutical industry-sponsored clinical trials commenced in Ireland between 2023 and 2024.  • Faster \"First Patient In\": The average time to recruit the first patient into a trial significantly improved, dropping by 31% from 67 days in 2023 to 46 days in 2024.  The NCTOG has also established sub-groups to work on costings and workforce planning, which are currently finalising their recommendations to be included in the final report of the Group. These recommendations will aid in establishing a standardised model of clinical trials costing, to increase predictability and help ease the process of setting up trials. The recommendations are also looking to support clinicians and research staff through supportive frameworks that will improve recruitment, reduce attrition rates, and support career pathways for researchers. In this regard, it is imperative that we continue to do all we can to ensure that both rewarding and sustainable career pathways are in place for those wishing to pursue and maintain careers across clinical research, including clinical trials.  I would also like to take this opportunity to thank the Data Protection Commission (DPC), who have contributed significantly to the work of the NCTOG in creating clarity and guidance on the various parties' responsibilities in relation Data Protection, the various interpretations of which have been a serious impediment to progressing clinical trial agreements in the past.  Notwithstanding the progress that has been made, challenges remain. The Group is currently deliberating on their final recommendations which will build on the successes to date achieved with the publication of the Interim Recommendations. I hope to be in position shortly to bring the final recommendations to Government for approval and I look forward to implementing next steps and continuing this journey in seeking to transform the clinical trials landscape in Ireland for the benefit of Irish society.

These recommendations will aid in establishing a standardised model of clinical trials costing, to increase predictability and help ease the process of setting up trials. The recommendations are also looking to support clinicians and research staff through supportive frameworks that will improve recruitment, reduce attrition rates, and support career pathways for researchers. In this regard, it is imperative that we continue to do all we can to ensure that both rewarding and sustainable career pathways are in place for those wishing to pursue and maintain careers across clinical research, including clinical trials.  I would also like to take this opportunity to thank the Data Protection Commission (DPC), who have contributed significantly to the work of the NCTOG in creating clarity and guidance on the various parties' responsibilities in relation Data Protection, the various interpretations of which have been a serious impediment to progressing clinical trial agreements in the past.  Notwithstanding the progress that has been made, challenges remain. The Group is currently deliberating on their final recommendations which will build on the successes to date achieved with the publication of the Interim Recommendations. I hope to be in position shortly to bring the final recommendations to Government for approval and I look forward to implementing next steps and continuing this journey in seeking to transform the clinical trials landscape in Ireland for the benefit of Irish society.",

Regulations were made in 1971, 1973 and 1975, prescribing 16 conditions to be covered by the Scheme. These are: acute leukaemia; mental handicap; cerebral palsy; mental illness (in a person under 16); cystic fibrosis; multiple sclerosis; diabetes insipidus; muscular dystrophies; diabetes mellitus; parkinsonism; epilepsy; phenylketonuria; haemophilia; spina bifida; hydrocephalus; and conditions arising from the use of Thalidomide.  Under the LTI Scheme, patients receive drugs, medicines, and medical and surgical appliances directly related to the treatment of their illness, free of charge. While there are currently no plans to extend the list of conditions, it is important to remember that the LTI Scheme exists within a wider eligibility framework.  People who cannot, without undue hardship, arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be eligible for a medical card under the General Medical Services (GMS) Scheme. In accordance with the provisions of the Health Act 1970 (as amended), eligibility for a medical card is determined by the HSE.  In certain circumstances the HSE may exercise discretion and grant a medical card, even though an applicant exceeds the income guidelines, where he or she faces difficult financial circumstances, such as extra costs arising from illness. The HSE afford applicants the opportunity to furnish supporting documentation to determine whether undue hardship exists and to fully take account of all relevant circumstances that may benefit them in assessment. In circumstances where an applicant is still over the income limit for a medical card, they are then assessed for a GP visit card, which entitles the applicant to GP visits without charge.  The issue of granting medical card eligibility based on having a particular disability or illness was previously examined in 2014 by the HSE Expert Panel on Medical Need and Medical Card Eligibility. The Group concluded that it was not feasible, desirable, nor ethically justifiable to list medical conditions in priority order for medical card eligibility. In following the Expert Group’s advice, a person’s means remains the main qualifier for a medical card.  Under the Drugs Payment Scheme (DPS), no individual or family pays more than €80 a month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines. The DPS is not means tested and is available to anyone ordinarily resident in Ireland. The DPS significantly reduces the cost burden for families and individuals with ongoing expenditure on medicines.  There has been a significant focus on improving access to and the affordability of healthcare services over the last few years. This includes reductions in the DPS threshold, expansion of access to free GP care, and the abolition of all public in-patient hospital charges for children and adults. These measures continue to create a health and social care service that offers affordable access to quality healthcare.  Individuals may also be entitled to claim tax relief on the cost of their medical expenses, including medicines prescribed by a doctor, dentist, or consultant. Relief is at the standard tax rate of 20%. ",

        "answerText": " Minister for Health  Digital for Care: A Digital Health Framework for Ireland 2024-2030 reflects the changing landscape of health and social care in Ireland and sets out a roadmap to digitally transform health services and improve access for patients. This framework, combined with the corresponding HSE implementation roadmap, sets out a very clear path for the full digitisation of healthcare records and information systems in Ireland, as stated in the Programme for Government.Implementation of Ireland’s Digital for Care strategy is progressing at pace following its publication in May 2024. It sets out vision to enable better health outcomes through seamless, safe, secure, and connected digital health services that support both patients and providers. This vision is grounded in the principles of Sláintecare. Government has also reflected the need to support increased capital investment levels especially in health digitalisation through the review of the National Development Plan that is ongoing.  Ireland needs one digital health record for every citizen that can be accessed by health professionals across the service. The path to a one digital health record that covers the full health journey of every person living in Ireland consists of three key initiatives under Digital for Care (and the Programme for Government) proceeding concurrently and in parallel to achieve this for patients and the healthcare workforce:  The HSE Health App was successfully launched in February 2025, giving patients real choice and empowering their control over their health journey with further releases planned this year. The app, that has already won a number of technology awards, represents an important step towards making personal health information available, putting each patient at the centre of their healthcare journey. It empowers people by providing a single app to manage their digital health identity, personal health information, health and social care coordination, and access to services. It continues to evolve with more services, data and features planned in regular future releases.  The Health Service Executive (HSE) completed the procurement for the National Shared Care Record (NSCR) earlier this year. The NSCR programme has now been mobilized, with the contract for building the NSCR technology platform awarded to EY, Better and Kainos. The NSCR brings together healthcare information from various sources such as hospitals, GP practices, and Community care into a single place, making them available at the point of care and self-care in read only format. By having access to key healthcare information in one place means healthcare professionals will be able to make more informed, safer decisions and to focus more time on direct patient care while patients will be better informed and empowered to manage their own healthcare.  A phased rollout of the national shared care record is due to commence in Q4 2025 in the South-East region with University Hospital Waterford. The system will then extend to other regions from 2026 with additional information being added over time.Together with the HSE Health App, investing in a NSCR means unlocking fragmented data into a powerful tool for safer, coordinated patient-centred care while laying the foundation for a modern, connected and more efficient health service as we plan for a National Electronic Health Record.  The Enterprise Electronic Health Record (EHR) is intended to support integrated care across all settings. A preliminary business case for the National EHR has been developed by the HSE, setting out the case for the most ambitious transformation programme in the history of the health service. It is currently subject to the External Assurance Process (EAP) as required under the Infrastructure Guidelines. The EAP report will then be issued to the Major Projects Advisory Group (MPAG) for advice to DPENDR and Government. A national enterprise EHR will allow healthcare staff to access a patient’s full medical history to support timely and appropriate care, with the ability to update information in real time. EHRs not only provide a complete digital health record of a patient’s health journey, recorded by healthcare professionals across all health and social care settings, they also incorporate workflow capabilities to automate the patient pathway and facilitate the implementation of standardised models of care. This means the EHR can map out the next steps in a patient’s treatment plan in the various care setting and support automatic referrals, ordering of diagnostics, lab tests, etc. To realise the benefits of an investment in EHRs, they must be underpinned by a clear roadmap, agreed up-front interoperability and data standards, appropriate governance and a robust business case. Deploying an EHR is not just about the technology. These are significant change programmes to transform and move from a paper based to a digitised care model.A PIN (Prior Information Notice) was published in June 2025 informing EHR suppliers about the health service's interest in a national enterprise-level EHR systems. This process is open to all potential vendors willing to engage through this process. The consultation seeks supplier input to inform the upcoming procurement, with a contract award expected by the end of 2026 and phased implementation through to 2032.  In another important step on our way to digitised patient records, in May the HSE published the tender for the delivery of a National Electronic Prescribing (NEP) service. The new fully integrated e-prescription service will enable the secure and efficient transmission and storage of electronic prescriptions and dispensations for patients. This provides a critical piece of information for digital health records and the data from this service (prescription and dispensing data) will be available through the HSE Health App and the NSCR in the future.

Government has also reflected the need to support increased capital investment levels especially in health digitalisation through the review of the National Development Plan that is ongoing.  Ireland needs one digital health record for every citizen that can be accessed by health professionals across the service. The path to a one digital health record that covers the full health journey of every person living in Ireland consists of three key initiatives under Digital for Care (and the Programme for Government) proceeding concurrently and in parallel to achieve this for patients and the healthcare workforce:  The HSE Health App was successfully launched in February 2025, giving patients real choice and empowering their control over their health journey with further releases planned this year. The app, that has already won a number of technology awards, represents an important step towards making personal health information available, putting each patient at the centre of their healthcare journey. It empowers people by providing a single app to manage their digital health identity, personal health information, health and social care coordination, and access to services. It continues to evolve with more services, data and features planned in regular future releases.  The Health Service Executive (HSE) completed the procurement for the National Shared Care Record (NSCR) earlier this year. The NSCR programme has now been mobilized, with the contract for building the NSCR technology platform awarded to EY, Better and Kainos. The NSCR brings together healthcare information from various sources such as hospitals, GP practices, and Community care into a single place, making them available at the point of care and self-care in read only format. By having access to key healthcare information in one place means healthcare professionals will be able to make more informed, safer decisions and to focus more time on direct patient care while patients will be better informed and empowered to manage their own healthcare.  A phased rollout of the national shared care record is due to commence in Q4 2025 in the South-East region with University Hospital Waterford. The system will then extend to other regions from 2026 with additional information being added over time.Together with the HSE Health App, investing in a NSCR means unlocking fragmented data into a powerful tool for safer, coordinated patient-centred care while laying the foundation for a modern, connected and more efficient health service as we plan for a National Electronic Health Record.  The Enterprise Electronic Health Record (EHR) is intended to support integrated care across all settings. A preliminary business case for the National EHR has been developed by the HSE, setting out the case for the most ambitious transformation programme in the history of the health service. It is currently subject to the External Assurance Process (EAP) as required under the Infrastructure Guidelines. The EAP report will then be issued to the Major Projects Advisory Group (MPAG) for advice to DPENDR and Government. A national enterprise EHR will allow healthcare staff to access a patient’s full medical history to support timely and appropriate care, with the ability to update information in real time. EHRs not only provide a complete digital health record of a patient’s health journey, recorded by healthcare professionals across all health and social care settings, they also incorporate workflow capabilities to automate the patient pathway and facilitate the implementation of standardised models of care. This means the EHR can map out the next steps in a patient’s treatment plan in the various care setting and support automatic referrals, ordering of diagnostics, lab tests, etc. To realise the benefits of an investment in EHRs, they must be underpinned by a clear roadmap, agreed up-front interoperability and data standards, appropriate governance and a robust business case. Deploying an EHR is not just about the technology. These are significant change programmes to transform and move from a paper based to a digitised care model.A PIN (Prior Information Notice) was published in June 2025 informing EHR suppliers about the health service's interest in a national enterprise-level EHR systems. This process is open to all potential vendors willing to engage through this process. The consultation seeks supplier input to inform the upcoming procurement, with a contract award expected by the end of 2026 and phased implementation through to 2032.  In another important step on our way to digitised patient records, in May the HSE published the tender for the delivery of a National Electronic Prescribing (NEP) service. The new fully integrated e-prescription service will enable the secure and efficient transmission and storage of electronic prescriptions and dispensations for patients. This provides a critical piece of information for digital health records and the data from this service (prescription and dispensing data) will be available through the HSE Health App and the NSCR in the future.",
        "formatted_question": "What is the current progress on the digitalisation of the health service, and will a statement be made?",
        "formatted_answer": "The government has introduced the Digital for Care framework (2024-2030), which outlines plans to digitize healthcare records. The Health Service Executive (HSE) has a separate implementation roadmap supporting this goal. The framework was published in May 2024, aligning with the Programme for Government. \n\nThree key initiatives are underway:\n\n1. **HSE Health App**: Launched in February 2025, this app allows patients to manage their health information and digital identity. It is set to expand with additional features.\n\n2. **National Shared Care Record (NSCR)**: Procurement was completed in 2025, with the contract awarded to EY, Better, and Kainos. The NSCR integrates healthcare information from various sources into a single platform for professionals. A phased rollout began in Q4 2025 in the South-East region, starting with University Hospital Waterford, with further expansion in 2026.\n\n3. **Enterprise Electronic Health Record"

In line with the Programme for Government commitments to build capacity in primary care therapy services, a programmatic approach to address primary care waiting lists has been developed jointly by the Department of Health, and the HSE.  This programmatic approach involves three main workstreams: Workstream 1 aims to deliver improved analysis of primary care therapy activity and productivity to maximise capacity within existing resources.  Acknowledging that there is a need for shorter-term measures to address the current scale of waiting lists, Workstream 2 focuses on the development of measures, at a national level, to address patients waiting more than a year to access primary care therapy services. At present, proposals are being examined to address the national waiting lists for physiotherapy, occupational therapy, and speech & language therapy.  The focus of Workstream 3 is developing a Primary Care Therapy Waiting List Management Protocol to ensure that a consistent and transparent approach to referral, waiting list management and discharge of patients is applied across the primary care therapies in all Community Healthcare Networks (CHNs) thus improving overall patient experience. Workstream 3 is being supported through the joint Health Research Board/Department of Health ‘Evidence for Policy’ programme.  In 2024, a research team was appointed to develop a comprehensive, evidence-based protocol to ensure a consistent and transparent approach to referral, waiting list management and discharge of patients is applied across primary care therapies in all HSE Health Regions thus improving overall patient experience.  It is expected that this programmatic approach will, for the first time, put in place considerable standardised infrastructure to support systematic responses to primary care waiting lists and facilitate a greater understanding of the scale of demand, the drivers of demand and will, very importantly, allow for more timely access, improved planning, interventions, investment considerations, enhanced productivity, and the most efficient use of capacity.
