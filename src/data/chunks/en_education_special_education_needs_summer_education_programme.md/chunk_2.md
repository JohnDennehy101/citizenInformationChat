##  What is the Summer Programme?

The Summer Programme gives educational support during the summer to:

  * Children with complex special educational needs, and 
  * Children most at risk of educational disadvantage. 

All primary schools and post-primary schools, including DEIS schools, can
provide a Summer Programme.

The Summer Programme 2024 includes:

  * **A Special School Pilot programme** for pupils in special schools 
  * **A primary school scheme** for pupils in mainstream primary schools, which combines the previous Inclusion Programme and special classes 
  * **Summer camps in DEIS schools** focusing on numeracy and literacy 
  * **A post-primary scheme** for pupils in post-primary schools 
  * **A home-based programme** for children with complex needs (where a school-based programme is not available) 

The Summer Programme is based on the _July Provision,_ which was delivered to
children with special educational needs in previous years by the Department of
Education.
