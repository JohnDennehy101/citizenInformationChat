##  Can I get school transport during the Summer Programme?

If you normally use the [ special education needs (SEN) transport scheme
](/en/education/special-education-needs/school-transport-for-children-with-
special-needs/) , it may be provided during the Summer Programme. If SEN
transport services are not available, you can apply for grant funding after
your child has completed the programme.

The [ School Transport Scheme ](/en/education/primary-and-post-primary-
education/going-to-post-primary-school/post-primary-school-transport-scheme/)
will not run during the Summer Programme. If your child normally uses the
School Transport Scheme, your school may make local transport arrangements.
You should contact your school for more details.
