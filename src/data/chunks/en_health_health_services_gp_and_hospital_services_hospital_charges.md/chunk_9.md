###  Public in-patients in public hospitals

If you are a public patient in a public hospital under the care of a
consultant for treatment and you remain overnight, you are receiving
_overnight in-patient services_ .

You can also be an in-patient if you are admitted to the hospital under the
care of a consultant and you do not require the use of a bed overnight and
your discharge from hospital is planned. This is called _day in-patient
services_ .
