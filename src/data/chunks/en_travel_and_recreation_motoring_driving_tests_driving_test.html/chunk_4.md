##  Driving tests waiting times

Covid-19 has caused delays, so it may take some time before you will be
offered an appointment.

You will be sent an invitation to book your driving test. You can use the [
RSA’s online driving test waiting time estimator
](https://rsa.powerappsportals.com/Driving-Test-Waiting-Time-Estimator/) to
check wait times.

Appointments are prioritised as follows:

  1. **Critical frontline workers** : priority customers whose [ request for an emergency test ](https://rsa.powerappsportals.com/emergency-test-request-form/) has been accepted. 
  2. **Re-tests** : people who have failed their test and reapplied. There’s a 6 to 8 week gap between failing your test and being invited for a retest. 
  3. **Eligibility and application date** : the earlier you applied, the sooner you will get an appointment, provided you were [ eligible to sit ](https://www.rsa.ie/services/learner-drivers/the-driving-test/what-it-is) a test at the time you applied. 

When you get your booking invitation you will have 10 days to select an
appointment. If you're not ready to sit a test, that's ok, you can hold off
booking and [ re-add yourself ](https://myroadsafety.rsa.ie/home/login/1000)
to the invitation queue at a later stage.

You can get more information on how to book your driving test from the [ RSA
website ](https://rsa.ie/en/RSA/MyRoadSafety/Book-a-driving-test/) .
