##  If English is not your first language

**Tests in the Irish language**

You can apply for your driving test to be conducted through Irish. To do this,
complete the [ Irish language version of the application form (pdf)
](https://www.rsa.ie/docs/default-source/services/s1.5-driving-test/rsa-
driving-test-application-form-\(irish\).pdf?sfvrsn=2b7e830f_5) and submit it
as normal.

**Tests for non-English speakers**

If English is not your first language, you may have an interpreter go with you
for the first part of the test where you answer questions on the Rules of the
Road and carry out technical checks. However, your interpreter cannot be your
driving instructor and they cannot go with you on the practical part of the
test.
