###  Who can make a complaint?

Anyone can make a complaint to the OCO. The OCO can accept complaints from
children and young people under the age of 18, and also from adults on
childrenâ€™s behalf.

Most complaints come from parents but people working with children such as
residential care staff, social workers and teachers also make complaints on
behalf of children. If a parent is not making the complaint, the OCO must
inform one parent that a complaint is being made.
