##  Do I have to pay?

If you have a valid [ disabled persons parking card ](/en/travel-and-
recreation/traffic-and-parking/disabled-persons-parking-card/) , the disabled
parking spaces provided by local authorities are free of charge.

Under local bye-laws, each local authority has the discretion to set time
limits for parking in these spaces. Some local authorities apply no time
limit, while others state that you must abide by the time limits displayed for
the area. Contact your [ local authority
](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/942f74-local-authorities/) for further
information about time limits in your area.

Some private car parks may charge for the use of a disabled parking space, but
this will vary depending on the operator.
