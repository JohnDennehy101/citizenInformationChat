##  Illness Benefit and other social welfare payments

Sometimes you can get Illness Benefit and another social welfare payment at
the same time. For example, you may get help under the [ Supplementary Welfare
Allowance Scheme ](/en/social-welfare/supplementary-welfare-
schemes/supplementary-welfare-allowance-scheme/) or the [ Back to School
Clothing and Footwear Allowance ](/en/social-welfare/families-and-
children/back-to-school-clothing-and-footwear-allowance/) , if you meet the
qualifying conditions.

The social welfare payments that can be paid with Illness Benefit are:

**Carer's Allowance (half-rate)** |  Illness Benefit and Half-rate Carer's Allowance can be paid at the same time, if you meet the qualifying conditions for both.  If you are getting an increase in your Illness Benefit for an adult dependant, your adult dependant can get a Half-rate Carer's Allowance if they meet the qualifying conditions.   
**Disablement Benefit** |  Disablement Benefit and Illness can be paid at the same time, if you meet the qualifying conditions for both and your Disablement Benefit payment does not include an Incapacity Supplement.   
**Domiciliary Care Allowance/Carer's Support Grant** |  Domiciliary Care Allowance and the Carer's Support Grant can be paid with Illness Benefit.
