####  Employer policy on sick pay and Illness Benefit

You should apply for Illness Benefit while you are out sick from work, whether
your employer pays you or not.

Illness Benefit is not linked to your employer's policy on [ pay for sick
leave ](/en/employment/employment-rights-and-conditions/leave-and-
holidays/sick-leave-and-sick-pay/) . However, if you get sick pay from work
and Illness Benefit, you should ask your employer about any arrangements in
place for this.
