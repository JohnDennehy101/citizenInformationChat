##  How to close your claim

You must close your claim when you are fit to return to work.

If you have a verified MyGovID account, you can close your claim online at
MyWelfare.ie, using the ‘Manage My Claim’ option on your claim card.

If you don’t have a verified MyGovID account, you can contact the Department’s
Illness Benefit – Close My Claim section by email at [
closemyibclaim@welfare.ie ](mailto:closemyibclaim@welfare.ie) or by phone (see
‘Contact details for Illness Benefit’ below).

Your doctor must mark your last ‘Certificate of incapacity for work’ as final
before you return to work.

If you cannot get the certificate marked, you should notify the Department’s
Illness Benefit – Close My Claim section by email or phone.
