##  What is the Leaving Certificate Vocational Programme?

The Leaving Certificate Vocational Programme (LCVP) is a Leaving Certificate
with a strong vocational focus and is distinct from the [ established Leaving
Certificate ](/en/education/state-examinations/leaving-certificate/) .

The LVCP focusses on developing students' practical skills for the world of
work alongside their academic subjects.

LCVP students must take:

  * 5 established Leaving Certificate subjects including Irish 
  * 2 link modules on enterprise education and preparation for work 

If you are exempt from Irish, you must choose another subject to ensure you
have 5 established Leaving Certificate subjects.
