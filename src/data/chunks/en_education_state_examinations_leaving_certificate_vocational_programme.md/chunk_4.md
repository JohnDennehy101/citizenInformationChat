###  The link modules

Students must take 2 link modules:

  * Preparation for the world of work 
  * Enterprise education 

The link modules are activity-based and are taken over the 2 years of the
programme.

The 2 modules usually take a total of 2 to 3 class periods per week, compared
with a Leaving Certificate subject, which generally takes 4 to 5 class periods
in a week.

The link modules help students to apply the knowledge and skills they gain
through their chosen subjects with the world outside the school.
