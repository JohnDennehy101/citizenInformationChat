###  Insolvent estate

Your estate is insolvent if your assets do not cover your:

  * Funeral 
  * Testamentary and administration expenses (the expenses of dealing with your estate) 
  * Debts and liabilities 

This is the case whether you had a will or died intestate (without a will).

If you have no assets then payment of debts does not arise.

Whatever assets you do have will be used to pay off your debts in the
following order of priority:

  1. Funeral, testamentary and administration expenses 
  2. Creditors who have security, for example, mortgage providers 
  3. Preferential debts - these are mainly taxes and social insurance contributions 
  4. Ordinary debts, for example personal loans or credit cards
