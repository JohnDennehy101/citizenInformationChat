##  Insurance policies

Some insurance policies have a nominated beneficiary. In this case, the
proceeds of the policy go directly to that beneficiary and do not form part of
your estate.

In other cases, the proceeds of the insurance policy do form part of your
estate and are available for the payment of your debts. What happens in any
particular case depends on the terms of the policy.
