##  Debts after death

Your _estate_ is all the property, goods and money that you own that are
available to be shared out after your death.

When you die, any debts you have must be [ repaid from your estate
](/en/death/the-deceaseds-estate/dealing-with-the-deceaseds-estate/) before
other entitlements are shared out. This is the case whether or not you have
made a will. Your creditors can sue your estate for the payment of outstanding
debts.

In some situations, property or money can be shared out without becoming part
of the estate and so is not available to pay debts. For example, some money in
credit unions or joint bank accounts and some insurance policies.

If you die and have no estate, then your debts die with you as they cannot be
repaid. Your relatives do not have to pay off your debts unless they have
provided personal guarantees for those debts or they are named on the credit
agreement

If someone close to you has died, you may need advice on [ dealing with money
