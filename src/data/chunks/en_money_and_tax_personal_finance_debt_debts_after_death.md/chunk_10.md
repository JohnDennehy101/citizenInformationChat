##  Duty of personal representative

When you die, all your assets are gathered together by your [ personal
representative ](/en/death/the-deceaseds-estate/what-happens-the-deceaseds-
estate/) , that is your executor (if you had a will) or administrator (if you
die without having made a will). The first duty of the personal representative
is to pay your funeral and other expenses and then your debts.
