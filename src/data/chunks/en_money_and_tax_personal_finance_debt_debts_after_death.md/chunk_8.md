###  Credit card debt, bank overdrafts, personal loans

If you have a credit card, bank overdraft or personal loan these are known as
_unsecured debts_ . They are not attached to any asset so the creditor does
not have the right to take a particular item of property if the debt is not
paid.

Lenders are entitled to pursue your estate for these unpaid debts on your
death. Repayment of unsecured debts must wait until other priority debts are
paid.

Your family does not have to cover your debts unless they have provided
personal guarantees. If the loan is in joint names the joint holder will be
responsible for any debts.

If your loan is with a credit union it will usually be cleared upon your death
through the credit unionâ€™s own insurance scheme.
