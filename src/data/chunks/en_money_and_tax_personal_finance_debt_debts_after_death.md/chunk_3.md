##  Family or shared home

If you and your spouse or partner are co-owners under [ joint tenancy
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/birth-family-relationships/cohabiting-
couples/property-rights-cohabiting-couples/#c83884) of the [ family or shared
home ](/en/birth-family-relationships/separation-and-divorce/family-and-
shared-home/) , your spouse or partner becomes the sole owner on your death.
In other words, your home does not form part of your estate.

If you are co-owners but you each own a defined share of the property, this is
called _tenancy in common_ . In those circumstances, your share in the
property will form part of your estate following your death.

If you are the sole owner, your property will form part of your estate.
However, your spouse, partner or cohabitant may be able to claim a share to
the property.

If there is a mortgage on the home, mortgage protection insurance may cover
the remaining amounts of the mortgage.
