####  Judgement if you are tried by a jury

  * At the end of the trial, the judge sums up the case for the jury. They explain the jury's function and directs the jury to limit itself to the evidence presented in court and to disregard any media reports. 
  * The judge must direct the jury on any legal points that arise. For example, they may explain the legal ingredients of the offence of murder so that the jury can arrive at a verdict that is in accordance with the offence charge. 
  * As the case is a criminal one, the judge will also explain to the jury that it must be satisfied of your guilt beyond reasonable doubt. 

**Beyond reasonable doubt**

In a criminal trial, guilt must be beyond reasonable doubt. Beyond reasonable
doubt means that if there are two reasons given in the case and both are
possible explanations for what happened, taken together with the evidence
presented, the jury should give you the benefit of the doubt.

However, in a civil trial before a jury, the judge would explain to the jury
that it must be satisfied of its verdict on the balance of probabilities.
