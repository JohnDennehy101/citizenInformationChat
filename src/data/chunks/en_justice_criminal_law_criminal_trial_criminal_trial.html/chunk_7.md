####  **If you plead not guilty**

If you have pleaded not guilty in the District Court and you have been sent
for trial by a judge and jury, you may then decide to plead guilty to the
offence. If you plead guilty at the Circuit Court, you will stand convicted
and the court will then decide your sentence.
