###  Indictable Offences

If you are charged with an indictable offence and you decide to plead guilty
when you appear in the District Court, you will have to sign a _plea of
guilty._

Before you sign a plea of guilty, the District Judge will first make sure you
are aware of the facts of the offence you are accused of and that you
understand the nature of the offence.

You will then be sent for sentencing to the court that you would have been
sent for a trial if you had pleaded not guilty (Circuit or Central Criminal
Court for indictable offences). Usually, you will be sent to this higher court
on another date.

If you change your mind, you may be allowed withdraw your plea of guilty at
the Circuit Court and the trial will go ahead.
