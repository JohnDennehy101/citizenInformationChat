####  Types of trial

There are two types of trial:

  * A summary trial - a trial conducted by a judge sitting alone 
  * Trial by jury - a trial conducted by a judge sitting with a jury 

Summary trials are heard in the [ District Court ](/en/justice/courts-
system/district-court/) .

If you are charged with an indictable offence, the District Court Judge will
send you to the [ Circuit Court ](/en/justice/courts-system/circuit-court/) or
the [ Central Criminal Court (High Court) ](/en/justice/courts-system/high-
court/) for trial by jury.

You will only be sent to these higher courts if the [ Director of Public
Prosecutions (DPP) ](http://www.dppireland.ie/) (lawyer that represents the
state in criminal cases) agrees to it. The court that will hear and decide on
your case depends on the type of offence involved.

Before the trial takes place, a number of issues must be dealt with including
the [ disclosure of evidence ](/en/justice/criminal-law/criminal-
trial/disclosure-in-criminal-cases/) and your option of pleading guilty.

After the trial, there is [ sentencing ](/en/justice/criminal-law/criminal-
trial/sentence/) if convicted.
