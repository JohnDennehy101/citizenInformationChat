##  Rate of tax relief

Tax relief is given at the standard rate of 20%.

There is no limit on the number of people for whom you can claim.

**Paying fees in instalments**

If you pay fees in instalments and at least one instalment is paid in the tax
year following the year your course started, then the relief for fees relating
to that academic year may be granted either:

  * In the tax year the course started, or 
  * The tax year in which the instalment was paid. 

It is generally more beneficial for you to claim tax relief in the tax year
that the course started. You can find [ examples of when it is of greater
benefit to claim on Revenue’s website ](https://www.revenue.ie/en/personal-
tax-credits-reliefs-and-exemptions/education/tuition-fees-paid-for-third-
level-education/paying-tuition-fees-in-instalments.aspx) .

Relief will only be granted in respect of amounts actually paid and subject to
the maximum relief available in that year.

**Undergraduate and postgraduate courses** :

The maximum amount of fees (including the Student Contribution) that can
qualify for tax relief is €7,000 per person, per course, per academic year.

**Information technology and foreign language courses** :

The course fees paid must not be less than €315 and not more than €1,270
(these refer to the course fee and are not simply an amount per annum).
