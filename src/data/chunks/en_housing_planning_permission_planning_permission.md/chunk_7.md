##  Before you apply for planning permission

Before applying for planning permission you must give public notice of your
proposals. You do this by:

  * Putting a notice in a local newspaper (your local authority will have a list), and 
  * Putting up a site notice that can be clearly seen and read 

You will find details of information that must be contained in the notices in
the planning application form. Your planning application must be received by
the local authority within 2 weeks of the notice appearing in the local
newspaper and the site notice going up.

**Note:**

The site notice must remain in place for at least 5 weeks from the date of
receipt of the planning application. (Note, nine days over Christmas, from 24
December to 1 January, are not taken into account when calculating the 5-week
period).
