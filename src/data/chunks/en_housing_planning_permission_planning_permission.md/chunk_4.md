###  What happens if I need planning permission but donâ€™t apply for it or get
it?

It is an offence to do work that requires planning permission, without having
planning permission. This offence can carry very large fines and possible
imprisonment. However, if a genuine mistake has been made, it is possible to
apply for planning permission to retain an unauthorised development. This
permission can be refused, in which case, the unauthorised development will
have to be demolished.
