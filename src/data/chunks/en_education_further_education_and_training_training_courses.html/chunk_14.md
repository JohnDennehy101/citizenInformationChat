###  **Specific Skills Training**

[ Specific Skills Training ](https://www.fetchcourses.ie/courses/fulltime)
lets you learn new work-related skills. The [ courses on offer
](https://www.fetchcourses.ie/courses/types) vary from centre to centre and
from year to year, with different levels of certification.

The courses are run during the day and in the evenings. Priority on daytime
courses is given to unemployed people. A day course is free to all unemployed
people, even if you are not getting a social welfare payment. An evening
course is not free unless you are getting a social welfare payment.

You may be able to keep your social welfare payment or get a FET training
allowance if you are doing a day course. To get a FET training allowance, you
must be entitled to a qualifying social welfare payment, such as [ Jobseeker's
Allowance ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/social-
welfare-payments/unemployed-people/jobseekers-allowance/) or [ Jobseeker's
Benefit. ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/social-
welfare-payments/unemployed-people/jobseekers-benefit/)
