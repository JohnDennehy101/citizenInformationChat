##  Health expenses and your dependent relative

You do not have to be getting a Dependent Relative Tax Credit to [ claim tax
back on medical expenses ](/en/money-and-tax/tax/income-tax-credits-and-
reliefs/taxation-and-medical-expenses/) you pay for a relative.

If you pay qualifying health expenses on behalf of another person (whether
they are dependent on you or not) you may be entitled to claim tax relief on
the amount paid. You can claim relief on expenses like:

  * Doctors' bills 
  * Maintenance or treatment in hospital 
  * Prescribed drugs and medicines. 

[ If you pay fees for a nursing home
](../income_tax_credits_and_reliefs/taxation_and_medical_expenses.en.html#l29c26)
that provides 24-hour on-site nursing care, you can claim income tax relief at
your highest rate of tax.
