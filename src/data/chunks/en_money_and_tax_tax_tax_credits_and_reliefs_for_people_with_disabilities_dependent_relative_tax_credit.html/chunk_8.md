Alternatively, you can claim the credit by completing the relevant form:

  * [ Form DR1 Claim for Dependent Relative Tax Credit (pdf) ](http://www.revenue.ie/en/personal-tax-credits-reliefs-and-exemptions/documents/formdr1.pdf) or 
  * [ Form DR2 Claim for a son or daughter or a child of your civil partner on whose services you depend (pdf) ](http://www.revenue.ie/en/personal-tax-credits-reliefs-and-exemptions/documents/formdr2.pdf)

The completed form should be sent to your Revenue office. It may take longer
to update your tax credits and issue a Tax Credit Certificate if you submit a
paper claim.
