####  **Reciprocal visa arrangements**

A [ British Irish Visa Scheme ](https://www.irishimmigration.ie/coming-to-
visit-ireland/british-irish-visa-scheme/) applies to visitors from China and
India. This scheme allows visitors from these countries to travel freely
within the Common Travel Area (excluding the Channel Islands and the Isle of
Man), using either an Irish or UK visa. British Irish Visa Scheme visas are
endorsed with ‘BIVS’.

Both schemes are provided for in the [ Immigration Act (Visas) Order 2014 (SI
473/2014) ](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2014/si/473/made/en/print) as
amended by [ Immigration Act (Visas) Order 2016 (SI 502/2016)
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2016/si/502/made/en/print) .
