###  Cross border workers

Irish and British citizens can live and work in both Ireland and the UK and
they can live in one country and work in the other country. For example, you
might live in Ireland and work in Northern Ireland. This is called frontier
working or [ cross-border working ](/en/government-in-ireland/ireland-and-the-
uk/cross-border-workers/) .

EEA and Swiss citizens who were living in Ireland and working in Northern
Ireland before the end of 2020, must have a [ Frontier Work Permit
](/en/government-in-ireland/ireland-and-the-uk/cross-border-workers/) to
continue working in Northern Ireland. EEA and Swiss citizens who live in
Ireland and start working in Northern Ireland from the beginning of 2021 must
apply for permission to work in the UK through the UKâ€™s [ points-based
immigration system ](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/the-uks-points-based-
immigration-system-information-for-eu-citizens) .
