###  **Other compensation**

Depending on the payment youâ€™re applying for, additional cash income may not
be taken into account. For example, if you received compensation from the
State Claims Agency for the Pandemrix vaccine, it will not be taken into
account in the means test for Disability Allowance.

You can find more information about how your means are assessed for particular
payments by [ searching for the payment on our website
