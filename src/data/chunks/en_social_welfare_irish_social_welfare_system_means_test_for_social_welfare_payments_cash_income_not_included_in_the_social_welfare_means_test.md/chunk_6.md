###  **If you host people from Ukraine**

The [ Accommodation Recognition Payment
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/moving-country/ukrainian-refugees-in-
ireland/accommodation-recognition-payment/) for hosting refugees from Ukraine
is not assessed in the means test for a weekly social assistance payment,
Working Family Payment or Supplementary Welfare Allowance. However, it is
taken into account for the [ Additional Needs Payment ](/en/social-
welfare/supplementary-welfare-schemes/additional-needs-payment/) (excluding a
supplement).
