##  What is a means test?

If you are applying for a [ social assistance payment
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-
system/social-assistance-payments/social-assistance-in-ireland/) , you must
pass a ‘means test’. In the means test, the Department of Social Protection
(DSP) looks at all your sources of income, for example:

  * Cash income 
  * Employment 
  * Capital and 
  * Maintenance (except maintenance payments for children) 

However, some income is not counted when your means are assessed. This page
looks at cash income not included in the means test. You can find more
information on income not taken into account in our page on the [ means test
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-
system/means-test-for-social-welfare-payments/means-test/) .
