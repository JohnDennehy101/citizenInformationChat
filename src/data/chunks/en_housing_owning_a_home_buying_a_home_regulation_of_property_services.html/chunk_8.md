##  What is the Residential Property Price Register?

The PSRA maintains and publishes the [ Residential Property Price Register
](https://www.propertypriceregister.ie/website/npsra/pprweb.nsf/page/ppr-home-
en) , which includes information on all residential properties purchased in
Ireland since 1 January 2010. The register includes the following information
about each residential property sold:

  * Date of sale 
  * Price of the property 
  * Address of the property 

The Register is produced using stamp duty declarations to the Revenue
Commissioners. It should not be viewed as a property price index.
