##  Using a property services provider

The PSRA has a useful [ guide for using PSPs in Ireland (pdf)
](https://www.psr.ie/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Guide-for-Users-of-Property-
Services-Providers-April-2017.pdf) . This guide provides information on what
to expect when using a licensed PSP. PSPâ€™s should behave professionally and
should follow the [ regulations ](https://www.psr.ie/wp-
content/uploads/2022/03/SI-Minimum-Standards-Regulation-Plain-English-
Guide.pdf) and [ Code of Practice ](https://www.psr.ie/wp-
content/uploads/2022/04/PSPs-Code-of-Practice.pdf) set out for the industry.

If you are a property owner and you use a PSP to sell, let or manage a
property, the PSP must give you a Letter of Engagement (LOE), also known as a
[ Property Services Agreement (PSA) ](https://www.psr.ie/licensees/letters-of-
engagement/) .

The LOE or PSA is an agreed contract between you and the PSP. The document
should clearly outline what property services are being provided and all costs
involved. An LOE or PSA is a legal and binding contract between you and your
agent.

More information is available on the [ PSRA website ](http://www.psr.ie/) ,
along with a sample of a letter of engagement (LOE) (or [ Property services
agreement (PSA)). ](https://www.psr.ie/licensees/letters-of-engagement/)
