###  **The Domino Scheme**

The Domino Scheme is a midwife-led maternity service in community-based
clinics.

On the Domino Scheme, you will be cared for by experienced community midwives
throughout your pregnancy, during your labour (in hospital) and for the first
week after your baby is born. This midwife-led care is combined with care from
your GP.

You will also be given the opportunity to leave the hospital early (early
discharge) if appropriate. You may be able to go home as soon as 6-12 hours
after your baby is born.

If you are using the Domino Scheme you may be supported by Domino midwives to
use natural birthing methods and minimum intervention.

The Domino Scheme is only available:

  * To women with normal-risk pregnancies (no pregnancy complications) 
  * In certain areas 
  * From certain maternity hospitals and maternity units 

If you are interested in using the Domino scheme, contact your local maternity
hospital or maternity unit to see if it is available in your area.
