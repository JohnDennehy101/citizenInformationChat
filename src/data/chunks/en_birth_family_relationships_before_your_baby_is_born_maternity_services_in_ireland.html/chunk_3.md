##  The Maternity and Infant Care Scheme

You can get free maternity care if you live in Ireland (or if you plan to live
here for at least 1 year) with the [ Maternity and Infant Care Scheme
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/health/health-
services/reproductive_health/maternity-and-infant-welfare-services/) . The
scheme includes your antenatal visits during your pregnancy, labour, delivery
and postnatal care after your baby is born. You do not need a medical card or
a GP visit card to use this scheme.

You can choose to split your care between your GP and your local maternity
unit/hospital. This is known as _combined care_ or _shared care_ .
Alternatively, you can choose to get all of your care at the hospital's
antenatal clinic. This option is available in all maternity units and
hospitals in Ireland.
