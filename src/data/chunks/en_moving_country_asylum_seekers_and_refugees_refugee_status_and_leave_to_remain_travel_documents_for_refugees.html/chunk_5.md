###  Refugees

If you were declared a refugee following an application for international
protection, you can get a refugee travel document. It says “Convention of 28
July 1951” on the front cover. It is sometimes called a ‘1951 Convention
Travel Document’. You can travel to most countries in the EU without a visa,
and stay for up to 90 days using this travel document. You should check with
the embassy of the country where you plan to travel.

Programme refugees cannot get a 1951 Convention Travel Document. Instead, you
can apply for a regular travel document.

A travel document for refugee is valid for a maximum of 5 years.
