##  Findings of an inquest

Nobody is found guilty or innocent at an inquest, and no criminal or civil
liability is determined. All depositions, post-mortem reports and verdict
records are preserved by the [ Coroner ](/en/death/sudden-or-unexplained-
death/coroners/) and made available to the public.

When the proceedings have been completed, a verdict is provided in relation to
the identity of the deceased, and how, when and where the death occurred. The
range of verdicts that can be declared by the Coroner or jury include:

  * Accidental death 
  * Misadventure 
  * [ Suicide ](/en/death/bereavement-counselling-and-support/support-services-for-those-affected-by-suicide/)
  * Natural causes 
  * Unlawful killing 
  * Open verdict 

An ‘open’ verdict means that the evidence does not fully or clearly explain
the cause and circumstances of death. It is most commonly used when none of
the other verdicts are appropriate.

The coroner or jury may also make a general recommendation to prevent similar
deaths occurring, without deciding whose fault the death was.

After the inquest is completed, the Coroner will issue a certificate so that
the [ death can be properly registered ](/en/death/practical-arrangements-
after-a-death/registering-a-death/) .
