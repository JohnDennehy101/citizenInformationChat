##  Witness at an inquest

The [ Coroner ](/en/death/sudden-or-unexplained-death/coroners/) decides which
witnesses should give evidence at the inquest and the order in which they
should give their evidence. Evidence must be presented in a logical order to
describe the sequence of the circumstances surrounding the death. The [ post-
mortem ](/en/death/sudden-or-unexplained-death/postmortems/) result
establishes the medical cause of death.

If you are required to attend an inquest as a witness, you can claim for loss
of earnings and expenses. The rates for fees and expenses are set by [
statutory instrument
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2009/si/155/made/en/print) .
