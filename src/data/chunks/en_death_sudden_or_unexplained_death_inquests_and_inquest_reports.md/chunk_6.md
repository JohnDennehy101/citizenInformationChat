###  Inquests are in public

All inquests are public and anyone can attend. Reports of an inquest may be
published in national and local newspapers, but in practice only a minority of
inquests are actually reported. You can get a copy of an inquest report from
the Coroner’s Office when the inquest has concluded. See ‘Findings of an
inquest’ below.
