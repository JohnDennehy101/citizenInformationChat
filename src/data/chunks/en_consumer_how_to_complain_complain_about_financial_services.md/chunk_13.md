###  Is there any cost to take a complaint to the FSPO?

Services from the FSPO are free.

If you lose your case, you wonâ€™t have to pay charges to the FSPO or to the
financial services firm against which you took your claim.

You may use a solicitor or any other professional to help you with your
application to the FSPO. Costs associated with hiring a professional are your
own responsibility.
