###  Awards and decisions of the FSPO

If the FSPO upholds a complaint, they may tell the company to rectify the
problem or pay you compensation, or both. If they do not uphold your
complaint, they will not direct any action. The FSPOâ€™s decision is binding on
you and the provider and can only be appealed to the High Court.
