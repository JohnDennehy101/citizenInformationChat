##  Registering the death

If a medical certificate of the cause of death is not available to register
the death, the coroner will arrange for a [ post-mortem examination
](/en/death/sudden-or-unexplained-death/postmortems/) of the body.

If the post-mortem shows that death was due to natural causes, and there is no
need for an [ inquest ](/en/death/sudden-or-unexplained-death/inquests-and-
inquest-reports/) , a Coroner's Certificate is issued to the Registrar of
Births and Deaths who then registers the death and issues the [ death
certificate ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/death/practical-
arrangements-after-a-death/registering-a-death/#eaa472) .

If an inquest is necessary, the death will be registered by means of a
Coroner's Certificate when the inquest is finished (or if it is adjourned).

Before the inquest or while waiting for the post-mortem report, the coroner's
office can provide an [ Interim Certificate of the Fact of Death
](https://www.gov.ie/en/service/71844-get-an-interim-death-certificate/) ,
which may be acceptable to banks, insurance companies and other institutions.
