##  Reporting a death to the coroner

Sudden, unexplained or violent deaths should be reported to the coroner by:

  * A healthcare professional, if the death was due to natural causes in a nursing home or if the doctor had not seen the deceased within one month before their death 
  * The Garda Síochána, if the death was from unnatural causes 
  * The deceased person’s doctor 
  * A funeral undertaker 
  * The Registrar of deaths 
  * Any householder and any person in charge of an institution or premises where the person who died was living 

The [ Garda Síochána ](/en/justice/law-enforcement/garda-siochana-national-
police-force/) will assist the coroner by:

  * Arranging formal identification of the body of the deceased by someone who knew them 
  * Providing a report on the circumstances of the death to the coroner 
  * Taking statements relating to the death, if necessary 

The Gardaí being involved does not mean that the death is being treated as
suspicious.
