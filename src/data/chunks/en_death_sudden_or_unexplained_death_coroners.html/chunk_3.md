##  How coroners are appointed

There is one coroner assigned to each coroner district, but more than one
coroner can be appointed in Dublin. A coroner can be temporarily appointed or
assigned to a district if the number or nature of deaths in the district calls
for it.

Coroner districts are roughly the same as local authority districts, but some
counties have more than one coroner district. For example, Wicklow has 2
coroner districts: Wicklow East and Wicklow West.

Coroners are appointed to districts by:

  * The Minister for Justice in Dublin 
  * [ Local authorities ](/en/government-in-ireland/how-government-works/local-and-regional-government/functions-of-local-authorities/) in the rest of the country 

Their expenses are managed by the relevant local authority.
