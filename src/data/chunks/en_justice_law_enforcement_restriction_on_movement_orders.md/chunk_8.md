##  What happens if I fail to obey a restriction order?

Because the Gardaí in your area get a copy of your order from the court, they
can monitor your compliance with it.

If the Gardai believe that you breached the order, they can go back to the
court and let the court know. If the court considers that you have breached
the order the court can do any of the following:

  * Direct you to comply with the order 
  * Cancel the order and impose another restriction on movement order on you 
  * Cancel the order and deal with your case in any other way it could have been dealt with before the order was made 

So, if you fail to obey the restriction of movement order, the court can
impose the punishment it would have done if it didn’t make the restriction of
movement order, including sending you to prison.
