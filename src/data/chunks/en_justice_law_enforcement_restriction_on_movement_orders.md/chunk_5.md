###  **Staying away from a particular place**

Similarly, the order can forbid you from being in a particular place for a
particular period. For example, you may have to stay away from a certain named
street or premises between 8pm and 8am.

Before making a restriction order, the court must explain to you:

  * What the order means 
  * What may happen if you do not comply with the restriction order 
  * That the court can vary the order if an application is made 

The court arranges for a copy of the restriction on movement order to be sent
to the Garda station for the area where the offender lives.
