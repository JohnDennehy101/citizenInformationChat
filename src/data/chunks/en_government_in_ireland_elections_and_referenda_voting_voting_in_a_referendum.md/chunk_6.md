###  Ballot paper

Voting is by secret ballot.

The ballot paper contains short instructions on how to vote and details of the
referendum proposal. It asks whether you approve of the proposal.

You should mark "X" in either the "yes" or the "no" box on the paper, then
fold it and place it in a sealed ballot box.

Pencils will be provided, but you can bring your own pen or pencil if you
wish.
