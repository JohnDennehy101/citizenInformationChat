##  How voting in a referendum works

The same constituencies that are used for a [ Dáil election ](/en/government-
in-ireland/elections-and-referenda/types-of-elections-and-referendums/the-
general-election/) are generally used for a referendum. The polling period
must be at least 12 hours between 7am and 10.30 pm on polling day.

You must vote in your local polling station. If you have a disability that
means that you cannot use your local polling station, you can apply to vote in
another polling station that is accessible for you.

There are special arrangements for people who are on the Postal Voters list or
the Special Voters List – see below.
