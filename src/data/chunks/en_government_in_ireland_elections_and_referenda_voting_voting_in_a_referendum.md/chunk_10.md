##  Voting at hospitals and nursing homes

If you are living in a hospital, nursing home or similar institution and you
have a disability or illness that prevents you from going to the polling
station, you can vote at the hospital or nursing home if you are on the [
Special Voters List ](/en/government-in-ireland/elections-and-
referenda/voting/registering-to-vote#l5150c) .

A special presiding officer will call to you at the hospital or nursing home
to allow you to vote. They will be accompanied by a Garda, whose role is to
guard the ballot papers and to act as an independent witness.

The presiding officer will give you a declaration of identity, which they will
witness for you. You then mark the ballot paper in secret, place it in the
special envelope provided, and present it to the presiding officer.

If you need help with voting, the special presiding officer will provide it in
the same way as at a polling station.
