##  Introduction

Secondary school in Ireland is similar to ‘high school’ in other countries. In
general, children start secondary school when they are 12 or 13.

Depending on your child’s age when you return to Ireland, they will start
secondary school in one of 6 years. See the table below for the general age
range of students in each school year:

**Secondary school year** |  **Student age range**  
---|---  
First year  |  12-13   
Second year  |  13-14   
Third year  |  14-15   
Fourth year  |  15-16   
Fifth year  |  16-17   
Sixth year  |  17-18   
  
All children in Ireland are entitled to free secondary school education. Most
children attend public secondary schools that are funded by the State.
