##  How to appeal a decision

If a school refuses to enrol your child because they are over-subscribed, you
can ask the schoolâ€™s board of management to review the decision. If the board
reviews the decision but your child still does not get a place, then you can
formally [ appeal the decision
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/education/the-irish-education-
system/admissions-policies-in-primary-and-secondary-schools#lc788f) .

You can also [ appeal to the Department of Education
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/education/the-irish-education-
system/admissions-policies-in-primary-and-secondary-schools/#dd86cf) if a
school refuses to admit your child for a reason other than the school being
oversubscribed.
