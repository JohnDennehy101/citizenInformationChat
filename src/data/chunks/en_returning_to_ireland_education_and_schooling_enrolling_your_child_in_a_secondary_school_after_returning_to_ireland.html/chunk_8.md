##  Step 2: Find schools in your area

You can [ search for secondary schools in your area using the Government’s
online directory ](https://www.education.ie/en/Find-a-School/) . You can
filter your search results by religious ethos, language of instruction, and
gender. You can then click into each individual school for their enrolment
numbers, contact details and inspection reports.

Most schools also have a website with information about their ethos, policies,
curriculum, and extra-curricular activities. If you can’t find the information
online, you can contact the school directly.
