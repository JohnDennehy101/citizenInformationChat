##  Step 1: Choose a school type

Depending on where your family settles in Ireland, you may have a choice of
secondary schools nearby. The schools may be public (funded by the state) or
private (fee-paying).

Each schoolâ€™s board of management or patron decides how it is run. For
example, a school can have a particular:

  * Religious ethos (for example, Catholic or multi-denominational) 
  * Language of instruction (English or Irish) 
  * Gender (all girls, all boys, or mixed)
