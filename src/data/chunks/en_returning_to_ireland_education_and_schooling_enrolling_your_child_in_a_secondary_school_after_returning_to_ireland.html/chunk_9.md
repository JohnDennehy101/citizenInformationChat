##  Step 3: Check if there is a place available

Contact the school directly to see if there is a place available for your
child. Every school has specific admission dates during which you can apply,
but schools can also accept students later in the year, if there are places
available.

If the school does not have enough places, it will give priority according to
its [ admissions policy ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/education/the-
irish-education-system/admissions-policies-in-primary-and-secondary-schools/)
.
