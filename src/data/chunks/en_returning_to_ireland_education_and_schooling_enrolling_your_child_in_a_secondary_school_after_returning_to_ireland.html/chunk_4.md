###  **Private school**

There are a small number of private secondary schools around the country.
Private schools are not free so you must pay annual tuition fees. Check with
the school directly for details of their fees and curriculum.

Private secondary schools are also called ‘independent schools’ and ‘non-
recognised schools’. If you send your child to an independent school, you must
[ register with the Alternative Education Assessment & Registration Service
(AEARS) ](https://www.tusla.ie/services/family-community-support/alternative-
education-assessment-and-registration-service/independent-schools/) in Tusla.
The AEARS regulates education outside of recognised schools.
