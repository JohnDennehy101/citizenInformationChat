##  What are the HAP rent limits?

In general, the rent must be within the [ HAP rent limits
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2017/si/56/made/en/print) for your
household size and the area you live in.

However, local authorities have flexibility to go above the HAP rent limits,
if you can’t find accommodation within the limits. They do this on a case-by-
case basis and can:

  * Go up to 35% above the rent limits. This [ flexibility was increased from 20% to 35% on 11 July 2022 ](https://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2022/si/342/made/en/pdf) and applies to new and existing HAP tenancies. 
  * Increase the HAP rates for a single person to the rates allowed for couples. This has been allowed since 11 July 2022 and applies to new HAP tenancies. 

There is also flexibility, on a case-by-case basis, for eligible homeless
households in the Dublin region, see [ What is Homeless HAP
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/housing/renting-a-home/help-with-
renting/housing-assistance-payment/#1f24b0) .

The table below shows the maximum monthly rent limits in each local authority
area for different types of household. If you have 4 or more children in your
household, contact your local authority to discuss your HAP rate.
