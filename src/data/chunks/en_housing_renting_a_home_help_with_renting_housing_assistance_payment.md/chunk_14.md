###  What if I need to end my HAP tenancy?

You will be expected to stay in your HAP accommodation for at least 2 years,
but in some situations you may be able to apply for a new HAP payment
somewhere else. For example, if you are offered a job in another town or if
your family grows too large for the property. You will need to contact your
local authority if you are thinking of moving.

If a tenant or a landlord wants to end a residential tenancy, they must [
comply with the relevant legislation ](/en/housing/renting-a-home/tenants-
