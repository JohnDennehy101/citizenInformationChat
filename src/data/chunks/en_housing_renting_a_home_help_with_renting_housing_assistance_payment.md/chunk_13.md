###  Additional rent payments and deposits

If your rent is more than the HAP limits allowed for your household, you must
pay the additional amount directly to your landlord. However, your local
authority must make sure that your tenancy is sustainable, so you will not get
a HAP payment if you canâ€™t afford the rent.

If your landlord needs a deposit, you will have to pay this yourself. The
local authority will not pay it for you. In certain circumstances, you may be
able to get [ assistance from the Department of Social Protection
](/en/social-welfare/supplementary-welfare-schemes/) to help with paying your
deposit. If you are in emergency homeless accommodation, your local authority
may help with a deposit.
