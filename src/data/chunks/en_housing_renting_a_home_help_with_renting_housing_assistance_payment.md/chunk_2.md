##  What is the Housing Assistance Payment?

The Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) is a social housing support for people
who have a long-term housing need.

The scheme is administered by the local authorities, who pay your landlord
directly.

The rent you are charged for the accommodation must be within the limits for
your household type in your local authority’s area – see ‘ [ What are the HAP
rent limits ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/housing/renting-a-
home/help-with-renting/housing-assistance-payment/#f60791) ’.

When you are a HAP tenant you pay a weekly HAP rent contribution to the local
authority, based on your income and ability to pay. **Under the HAP scheme you
can take up full-time employment and keep your housing support.**

There is detailed information about HAP on [ hap.ie ](http://hap.ie/) ,
