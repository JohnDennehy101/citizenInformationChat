##  How do I apply for HAP?

If you are not yet on your local authorityâ€™s housing list, you will need to [
apply for social housing support ](/en/housing/local-authority-and-social-
housing/applying-for-local-authority-housing/) in the usual way.

If you are already on the housing list, you can ask your local authority for a
HAP application form. This form only needs to be filled in when you have found
suitable accommodation, or if you are already in private rented accommodation
and eligible to transfer to HAP. Your landlord will need to complete and sign
part of the HAP application form.

If you are a tenant and in any doubt about whether your tenancy arrangement
qualifies for HAP, check with your local authority.

If you are homeless in the Dublin region, contact the Dublin Place Finder
Service on [ placefinders@dublincity.ie ](mailto:placefinders@dublincity.ie)
or contact the homeless section of your [ local authority
](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/942f74-local-authorities/) to apply for
HAP.

If you are getting Rent Supplement and qualify for social housing support, you
can apply for HAP for your existing accommodation.

If you have been getting Rent Supplement for a long time (generally 18 months
or more) you may get a letter from the Department of Social Protection, asking
you to contact your local authority to apply for social housing support (which
includes HAP). You may then be transferred to HAP or to another form of social
housing support.

If you are approved for HAP, you then sign a Rent Contribution Agreement with
the local authority. You may be asked for a copy of the rental agreement with
your landlord.
