##  What is Homeless HAP?

The [ Homeless HAP scheme ](https://www.homelessdublin.ie/homeless-hap) is
operated by the Dublin Region Homeless Executive (DRHE) for the Dublin local
authorities. It provides discretion to exceed the HAP rent limits by up to 50%
for homeless households, if this is necessary to source suitable
accommodation. To qualify for Homeless HAP, a household must be accepted as
homeless within the meaning of [ section 2 of the Housing Act 1988
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1988/act/28/section/2/enacted/en/html) by
one of the 4 Dublin local authorities.

A Homeless HAP Place Finder Service is available in all local authority areas.
This Service helps homeless households or households at immediate risk of
homelessness, who are finding it difficult to get a HAP tenancy. The local
authority can help with any deposit or advance rental payments needed to get
accommodation under the HAP scheme.

The [ Dublin Place Finder Service
](https://councilmeetings.dublincity.ie/documents/s2209/HAP%20Dublin%20Place%20Finder.pdf)
also supports homeless households in the Dublin region to find a tenancy using
HAP. You should contact the housing section of [ your local authority
](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/942f74-local-authorities/) for further
information on this.
