##  What if I find accommodation in another local authority area?

If you qualify for social housing support in one local authority area, but
find suitable rented accommodation in another area, you may be able to get HAP
from the first local authority to help pay for it. This means you won’t have
to be reassessed for social housing support or reapply for HAP in the new
area.

This process is known as Inter-Authority Movement of Housing Assistance
Payment (HAP) Scheme Applicants.

To qualify, one of the following must apply:

  * The [ income limit for social housing support ](https://www.gov.ie/pdf/?file=https://assets.gov.ie/236056/59ecede4-f862-4c5d-bf5a-e1a1d4ff9a63.pdf#page=null) in the new local authority area is the same or higher than the limit in the area where you qualified. (There are 3 different qualifying income limits for social housing support, with different limits applying to different locations.) 
  * Your income is below the social housing support limit in the new local authority area, if the income limit in that area is lower than in the area where you qualified. This will be verified by the local authority. 
  * Both local authority areas offer ‘shared areas of choice’ in their housing allocations schemes. 

You may also need to meet other criteria to qualify. The local authority will
decide on your case.
