###  **How does it work?**

Your original local authority will treat you as if you are renting
accommodation in their area. Their housing allocations scheme will apply to
you and you can be added to their social housing transfer list.

However, the new local authority will be responsible for inspecting the
property and the HAP rent limits for the new area will apply to the property.

If you have questions about this process, you should contact your [ local
authority ](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/942f74-local-authorities/) for
more information.
