###  How to make a complaint against a Dentist

You must first make a complaint directly to the staff in the dental surgery
involved. They should give you full details of the complaints procedure and
try to sort out your complaint. If you are not satisfied with the response you
receive, you can contact the [ Dental Complaints Resolution Service
](https://dentalcomplaints.ie/) who will work with you and the dentist to
resolve the complaint.
