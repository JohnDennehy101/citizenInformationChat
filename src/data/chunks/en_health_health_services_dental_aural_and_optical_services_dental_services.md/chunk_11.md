###  Tax relief on dental expenses

If you pay for dental services from a private practitioner, you may claim tax
relief for certain specialised dental treatments. (Routine treatments such as
extractions, scaling and filling of teeth and provision and repairing of
artificial teeth and dentures are excluded from tax relief).

Further information on how to claim tax relief for specific dental costs
incurred by you whether for yourself, your spouse, your dependent child or a
dependent relative is available in our document on [ taxation and medical
