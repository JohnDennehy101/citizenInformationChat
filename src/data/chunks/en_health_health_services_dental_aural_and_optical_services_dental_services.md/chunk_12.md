###  Clinical Dental Technicians

Clinical Dental Technicians are dental healthcare professionals, registered
with the [ Dental Council ](http://www.dentalcouncil.ie/) . They provide
complete dentures and partial dentures directly to adult patients who have
recently been assessed by a dentist. They do not carry out work on natural
teeth or on living tissue.

Clinical Dental Technicians who have a contract with the HSE can treat medical
card holders under the Dental Treatment Services Scheme, providing approved
dentures and relines as well as denture repairs and additions.
