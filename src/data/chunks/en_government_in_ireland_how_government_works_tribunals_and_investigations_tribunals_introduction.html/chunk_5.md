###  Committees of Inquiry

Some committees have been set up to investigate specific incidents or
controversies of public importance. Some examples are:

  * Joint Committee of Inquiry into the Banking Crisis 
  * Judicial appointments inquiry 
  * Arms crisis inquiry 
  * Abbeylara inquiry 
  * DIRT inquiry 

The power of parliamentary committees has been limited by the courts. In 2002,
the Supreme Court held that the Houses of the Oireachtas did not have the
power under the Constitution to make findings of fact. A proposed change to
the Constitution to reverse the effects of this judgment was rejected by the
Irish people in a 2011 referendum.

The framework for parliamentary inquiries is now set out in the [ Houses of
the Oireachtas (Inquiries, Privileges and Procedures) Act 2013
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2013/act/33/enacted/en/html) . Inquiries
can be concerned with systems, practices, procedures, policies and the
implementation of policy, and the effectiveness of legislative and regulatory
systems.

Such inquiries may not make any findings that adversely affect the good name
of someone who is not:

  * A member of [ the DÃ¡il ](/en/government-in-ireland/houses-of-the-oireachtas/dail-eireann/) or [ Seanad ](/en/government-in-ireland/houses-of-the-oireachtas/the-seanad/) , or 
  * An officeholder or 
  * Someone who is directly accountable to the Oireachtas
