###  **Creation of small native forests for water protection – NTA 2**

This option is for people planting native forestry beside waterways, such as
streams, rivers and lakes.

The purpose of this option is to protect and improve water quality and aquatic
life.

You must plant an area of between 0.1 and 1 hectare. The area (or areas) must
be at least 20 metres in width, measured tree-to-tree, or 25 metres when open
spaces are included for Areas of Biodiversity Enhancement (ABE’s).

ABE’s are spaces which are left open to encourage and support biodiversity in
an area, for example, aquatic buffer zones.

You can combine both of these options in one farm, so long as you do not
exceed the maximum amount of forestry for the scheme. This is 2 hectares.
