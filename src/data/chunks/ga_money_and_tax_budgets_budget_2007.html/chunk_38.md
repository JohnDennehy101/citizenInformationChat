###  Less frequent vat returns for small businesses

The frequency of VAT payments, currently six per year, for smaller businesses
is being reduced with effect from July 2007. For businesses with a yearly
liability of €3,000 or less, the option of filing returns on a half-yearly
basis will be available. For businesses with a yearly liability between €3,001
and €14,400, the option of filing returns every four months will be available.
This will reduce compliance costs for the firms in question.
