##  Night work hours and limits

In general the [ maximum average working week ](/en/employment/employment-
rights-and-conditions/hours-of-work/working-hours/) is 48 hours. As a night
worker, you should not work more than an average of 8 hours in a 24-hour
period.

The average is calculated over either:

  * A 2-month period 
  * A longer period if it is part of a collective agreement (for example, a trade union agreement)
