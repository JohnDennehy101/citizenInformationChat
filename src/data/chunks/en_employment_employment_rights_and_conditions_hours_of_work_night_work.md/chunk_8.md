##  Sleepover shifts

If you work in a residential healthcare setting that provides care on a
24-hour, 7-day-a-week basis, you may be required to sleep at your workplace.

A sleepover shift is when you are in work for a continuous period of 8 hours
or more between 11pm and 8am. You are entitled to at least minimum wage if you
work a sleepover shift, even if you are allowed to sleep between tasks.
