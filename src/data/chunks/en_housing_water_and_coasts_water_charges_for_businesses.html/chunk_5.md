###  Metered accounts

A metered account involves a meter being fitted to monitor commercial water
usage. Commercial metered accounts are subject to a standing charge for water
and wastewater for the meter itself. The standing charge is usually paid on a
quarterly basis.

A domestic allowance is available where the water supply is used jointly for
domestic and commercial use. The domestic allowance can vary between local
authorities.
