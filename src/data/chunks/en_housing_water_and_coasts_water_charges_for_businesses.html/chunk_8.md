###  **Recent changes** to non-domestic water charges

In 2019, Irish Water agreed a new [ Non-Domestic Tariff Framework
](https://www.water.ie/for-business/billing-explained/charges/) with the
Commission for Regulation of Utilities (CRU). This framework standardises non-
domestic water charges across local authorities and town councils, meaning
businesses will pay the same amount for their water nationwide. This new
system of charges have applied since 1 October 2021.
