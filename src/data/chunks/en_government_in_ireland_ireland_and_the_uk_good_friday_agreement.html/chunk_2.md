##  Introduction

The Good Friday Agreement, which is also known as the [ Belfast Agreement
](http://education.niassembly.gov.uk/post_16/snapshots_of_devolution/gfa) ,
was signed on Good Friday, 10 April 1998. It consists of two closely related
agreements, the [ British-Irish Agreement
](https://www.britishirishcouncil.org/about/british-irish-agreement) and the [
Multi-Party Agreement
](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/136652/agreement.pdf)
. It led to the establishment of a system of devolved government in Northern
Ireland and the creation of many new institutions such as the Northern Ireland
Assembly and Executive, the North South Ministerial Council and the British-
Irish Council.

The Good Friday Agreement was approved by referendums held in both [ Ireland
](https://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1998/ca/19/enacted/en/html) and [
Northern Ireland ](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1998/47/enacted) on 22
May 1998. Voters in Northern Ireland were asked to approve the Multi-Party
Agreement and voters in Ireland were asked to approve both the Multi-Party
Agreement and certain constitutional changes in the British-Irish Agreement.
