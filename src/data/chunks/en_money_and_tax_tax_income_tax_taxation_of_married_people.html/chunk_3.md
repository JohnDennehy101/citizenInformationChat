##  Taxation of civil partners

Civil partners are entitled to the same rights as married couples in financial
matters such as tax, inheritance, property, pensions and maintenance if the
relationship breaks down. Some legal relationships between same sex couples
that are recognised by a foreign state (such as marriage, civil union, civil
partnership) are recognised by Revenue for taxation purposes. You can read [
