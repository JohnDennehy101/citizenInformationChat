##  Introduction

If you get married, both you and your spouse continue to be treated as single
people for tax purposes in that year. If, however, the tax you pay as two
single people is greater than the tax that would be payable if you were taxed
as a married couple, you can claim the difference as a tax refund. Refunds are
only due from the date of marriage and will be calculated after the following
31 December. So, for example, if you get married in 2024, any tax refund due
to you will be calculated after 31 December 2024.

Refunds are normally only due where a couple are taxed at different rates and
one spouse could benefit from the unused standard rate cut-off point or for
some of the unused tax credits of the other spouse.

When you get married it is important to inform Revenue of the date of your
marriage. You can [ update your marital status with Revenue online
