##  Your first visit to the hospital or maternity unit

Your first visit to the hospital or maternity unit is called a ‘booking
visit’.

During this appointment, you will:

  * Tell a midwife about your medical history, family history and any previous pregnancies. 
  * Have your blood pressure checked. 
  * Have your urine checked. 
  * Have a [ blood test ](https://www2.hse.ie/wellbeing/child-health/blood-tests-offered-in-pregnancy/blood-tests-offered-in-pregnancy.html) . 
  * Get information about [ antenatal classes ](https://www2.hse.ie/wellbeing/child-health/antenatal-classes.html) and [ breastfeeding ](https://www2.hse.ie/babies-and-toddlers/breastfeeding/) . 
  * Be referred for specialist appointments if needed (for example, with physiotherapists, dietitians, smoking cessation specialists or alcohol cessation specialists). 
  * Have the opportunity to ask the midwife any questions. 

In some hospitals, you may have an ultrasound scan on your first visit, at
others you will have it at around 20 weeks.

Your first visit to hospital will last approximately 2 hours. If your
pregnancy is normal, follow-up visits will be much shorter.
