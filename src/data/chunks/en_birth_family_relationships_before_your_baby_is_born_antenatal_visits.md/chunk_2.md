##  Introduction

An antenatal visit is any appointment with your GP or maternity unit that
relates to your pregnancy.

If you have registered for the [ Maternity and Infant Care Scheme
](/en/health/health-services/reproductive_health/maternity-and-infant-welfare-
services/) you will have some of your antenatal appointments with your GP and
the others with your maternity unit. The schedule of antenatal appointments
can be different depending on your pregnancy.

  * If it is your first pregnancy, you will usually have 6 antenatal appointments with your GP, and 6 antenatal appointments at your maternity unit or hospital. 
  * If it is a second or subsequent pregnancy, you will usually have 7 antenatal appointments with your GP, and 5 antenatal appointments at your maternity unit or hospital. 

You may have additional appointments if you are diagnosed with a pregnancy-
related condition (such as high blood pressure or gestational diabetes, or if
you are pregnant with twins or multiple babies).

You will also have 2 postnatal appointments with your GP _after_ your baby has
arrived, at 2 weeks (for your baby) and 6 weeks (for you and your baby).

If you have registered for the [ Maternity and Infant Care Scheme
](/en/health/health-services/reproductive_health/maternity-and-infant-welfare-
services/) , these antenatal and postnatal visits are free.

You are entitled to take paid time off from your employment to attend
antenatal appointments (and some antenatal classes). Your employment rights
during pregnancy are protected in [ Irish law
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1994/en/act/pub/0034/index.html) .
