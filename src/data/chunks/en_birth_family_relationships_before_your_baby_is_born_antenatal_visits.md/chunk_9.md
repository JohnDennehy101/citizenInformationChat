Your midwife or doctor will continue to monitor your health. They will check
for signs of high blood pressure or other complications.

They will also check the position of your baby and the baby’s development, as
well as the height of your womb (uterus) and your baby’s heart rate.

You may not need to be scanned after your scan at [ 20 weeks

  * Breastfeeding 
  * Any concerns you may have
