##  Your first antenatal visit

If you have registered for the [ Maternity and Infant Care Scheme
](/en/health/health-services/reproductive_health/maternity-and-infant-welfare-
services/) , your first appointment will be with your GP. They will do
antenatal checks (such as blood pressure and urine checks) and give you
information on how to have a healthy pregnancy. They will help you estimate
your due date, and they might discuss folic acid, exercise and healthy eating
with you.

Your GP will also talk to you about vaccines. You will be offered a [ flu
vaccine ](https://www.hse.ie/eng/health/immunisation/pubinfo/flu-
vaccination/flu-vaccine-pregnancy/) during one of your appointments (the flu
season is from October to April). While the appointment will be free, you may
be charged for the administration of the flu vaccine if you do not have a
medical card.

When you are between 16-36 weeks, you will also be offered a vaccination to
protect your baby from [ whooping cough (pertussis)
](https://www2.hse.ie/conditions/child-health/whooping-cough-in-babies-and-
children/how-whooping-cough-affects-children.html) . This is available free of
charge.
