###  Bail

If you are refused bail in the District Court you can apply to the High Court
for bail. If you are granted bail in the District Court, you can apply to the
High Court to change the conditions of bail. If you are charged with murder
and certain other serious offences, you can only apply to the High Court for
bail.
