##  Introduction

The High Court is the third tier of [ the Irish courts system
](/en/justice/courts-system/courts/) and the highest tier in which legal
proceedings can be commenced. It has jurisdiction over civil and criminal
matters and hears the more serious cases, such as trials for murder.

Unlike the [ Circuit Court ](/en/justice/courts-system/circuit-court/) and [
District Court ](/en/justice/courts-system/district-court/) , the High Court
is not a court of local and limited jurisdiction. This means that it is not
restricted to hearing cases from certain areas and there is no limit to the
amount of monetary damages it can award.

You can appeal the outcome of a case originally heard in the High Court to the
[ Court of Appeal ](/en/justice/courts-system/court-of-appeal/) or, in some
instances, directly to the [ Supreme Court ](/en/justice/courts-
system/supreme-court/) .
