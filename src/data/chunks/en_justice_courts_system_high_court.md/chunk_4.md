##  Civil cases

The High Court can determine all matters and questions, whether of law or
fact, civil or criminal. The High Court can deal with actions from all parts
of the country and there is no general limit or restriction on how much money
the Court may award in compensation or damages.

In certain more serious civil cases (such as defamation or claims for damages
for assault) a judge may sit with a [ jury
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/justice/courtroom/jury/) in the High
Court. In all cases, a majority vote of 9 of the 12 jurors is needed to
determine the verdict.

The High Court can:

  * Hear cases about claims for damages of over €75,000 (personal injury €60,000) 
  * Hear questions about the validity of a law 
  * Hear appeals from the Circuit Court in civil matters 
  * Review the decisions of all lower courts by judicial review 
  * Give rulings on a question of law submitted by the District Court and can hear appeals in certain other circumstances provided by statute 
  * Review decisions of certain Tribunals of Inquiry 
  * Review certain [ decisions made by public bodies ](/en/government-in-ireland/how-government-works/standards-and-accountability/judicial-review-public-decisions/) (for example, decisions of the Minister for Justice on immigration matters)
