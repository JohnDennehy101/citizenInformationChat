####  **What is considered alternative accommodation?**

You will be considered as having alternative accommodation if you or a member
of your household has property that you could reasonably be expected to use to
meet your housing needs. This property will be considered alternative
accommodation if you could live in it, or sell it and use the money to pay for
suitable accommodation. Alternative property includes property you own abroad,
or property that you are renting out. Under residential tenancies legislation
you can [ terminate the tenancy ](/en/housing/renting-a-home/tenants-rights-
and-responsibilities/if-your-landlord-wants-you-to-leave/) if your household
needs the property to live in.

A property will not be regarded as alternative accommodation if it:

  * Is occupied by someone who is divorced or separated* from a member of the household, or whose civil partnership with a household member has been dissolved 
  * Would be overcrowded if the household lived in it 
  * Is unfit for human habitation 
  * Would not adequately meet the accommodation requirements of a household member with a disability 

* A couple does not have to be [ judicially separated ](/en/birth-family-relationships/separation-and-divorce/judicial-separation/) in order for this to apply. A deed of separation is sufficient â€“ see our document on [ separation agreements ](/en/birth-family-relationships/separation-and-divorce/separation-agreement/) .
