###  If your application is not accepted

If your application is not accepted, the local authority should give you the
reasons for their decision. If it does not, you can apply to see your file
under [ Freedom of Information ](/en/government-in-ireland/how-government-
works/standards-and-accountability/freedom-of-information/) .

If you want to challenge the local authority’s decision, you can appeal it
with them. Each local authority has their own internal appeal process for
dealing with appeals.

If you are not happy with the outcome of the internal review you can make a
complaint to the Ombudsman. The [ Office of the Ombudsman ](/en/government-in-
ireland/how-government-works/standards-and-accountability/office-of-the-
ombudsman/) investigates complaints about local authorities and other public
bodies. You must make your complaint within 12 months of the local authority’s
decision. The Ombudsman will investigate your complaint and make a decision
and recommendations on the issue. They may ask the local authority to review
its decision, change its decision, or provide an explanation or compensation.

You can also appeal the local authority’s decision in court. Generally, this
is done by applying to the High Court for [ judicial review of the decision of
the local authority ](/en/government-in-ireland/how-government-
works/standards-and-accountability/judicial-review-public-decisions/) .
