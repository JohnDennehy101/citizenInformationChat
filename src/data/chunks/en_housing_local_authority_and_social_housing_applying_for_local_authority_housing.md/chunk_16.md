##  What happens to my social housing application next?

The local authority has 12 weeks from receiving your completed application
form to assess it and make a decision on whether you qualify for social
housing or not. This timeframe can be extended if the local authority needs
additional information, which they will request from you. You must submit the
additional information in the required timeframe, or your application may be
refused.
