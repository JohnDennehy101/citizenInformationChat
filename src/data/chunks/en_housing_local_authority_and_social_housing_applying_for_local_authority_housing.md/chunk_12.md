###  Picking areas of choice

You can specify up to 3 areas where you would choose to live. At least one of
them must be in the area administered by the housing authority that you apply
to (its _functional area_ ) and the others must be either in that functional
area or within the same county. If you do not live in or have a connection
with the housing authority’s own functional area, but the authority has agreed
to accept an application from you, you can only pick areas of choice within
that particular authority’s functional area.
