###  What documents do I need for proof of income?

You need to provide proof of your income with your application when applying
for social housing to show that you meet the income criteria. The documents
you need are different depending on whether you are employed, self-employed or
getting a social welfare payment.

**If you are getting a social welfare payment** , you will need a statement
from the Department of Social Protection detailing all your social welfare
payments over the previous 12 months.

**If you are self-employed** , you will need to provide at least 2 years’
accounts with an auditor’s report, and a notice of assessment and/or a self-
assessment acknowledgement letter for the previous 12 months.

**If you are employed** , you will need evidence of your income for the
previous 12 months. You can use the following documents to provide proof of
your household income from last year and your household’s current income:

  * **Proof of income for last year:** Last year's Statement of Liability (formerly P21) and Employment Detail Summary (formerly P60). These are both available from Revenue. You can use [ Revenue’s online service, myAccount ](https://www.ros.ie/myaccount-web/sign_in.html?execution=e1s1) to access these documents. See our pages on how to get your [ Statement of Liability ](/en/money-and-tax/tax/income-tax/how-to-review-your-tax-for-PAYE-taxpayers#l07617) and [ Employment Detail Summary ](/en/employment/employment-rights-and-conditions/pay-and-employment/no-p45-no-p60#l7e30a) for more information. 
  * **Proof of current income:** Payslips or a Pay and Tax Summary for the current tax year up to the date you apply. The Pay and Tax Summary is available from Revenue. 

**Note** : If you pay an [ Additional Superannuation Contribution (ASC) (pdf)
](https://assets.gov.ie/7407/5ee8f7cf2f9e4030b65144424aae4a1d.pdf) , you must
also provide the previous year’s last payslip and your most recent payslip.
ASCs only apply to people in public service pension schemes.
