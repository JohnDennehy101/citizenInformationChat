###  If your application is accepted

If you are accepted by the housing authority as being eligible for and in need
of housing, you are placed on its housing list or _record of qualified
households_ . It will also notify any other housing authority in whose
functional area you have specified an area of choice.

If you are in private rented accommodation while you are on the housing list,
you may be able to get [ Rent Supplement ](/en/social-welfare/supplementary-
welfare-schemes/rent-supplement/) . If you are getting the [ Housing
Assistance Payment (HAP) ](/en/housing/renting-a-home/help-with-
renting/housing-assistance-payment/) , which is legally defined as a form of
social housing support, you will no longer be on the housing list.

However, if you apply for a transfer from HAP to another form of social
housing **within 2 weeks of getting the letter confirming your HAP payment** ,
any time that you spent on the housing list can be taken into account when
your local authority considers your application.
