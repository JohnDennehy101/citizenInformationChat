###  3\. You must need social housing

When deciding if your household needs social housing, the housing authority
considers:

  * Is your current accommodation an institution, emergency accommodation or hostel? 
  * Are you homeless within the meaning of [ section 2 of the Housing Act 1988 ](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1988/act/28/section/2/enacted/en/html) ? 
  * Is your current accommodation overcrowded? 
  * Is it fit for human habitation? 
  * Does it meet the accommodation requirements of a household member with a disability? 
  * Is it unsuitable for your household’s adequate housing on exceptional medical or compassionate grounds? 
  * If it is shared with another household, have you a reasonable requirement for separate accommodation? 
  * Has your household’s current mortgage been classified as unsustainable as part of the [ Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process (MARP) ](/en/housing/owning-a-home/mortgage-arrears/mortgage-arrears-resolution-process/) ? 
  * Is your household dependent on [ Rent Supplement ](/en/social-welfare/supplementary-welfare-schemes/rent-supplement/) to meet its housing need? 
  * Is your current accommodation unsuitable because it does not adequately house your household in any other way, having regard to particular household circumstances?
