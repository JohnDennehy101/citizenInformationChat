###  **Applying for disability or medical priority**

If you have a disability or medical condition, you may be prioritised on your
local authorityâ€™s housing list. There is a supporting [ Disability or Medical
Information Form (HMD Form)
](https://www.dublincity.ie/sites/default/files/2023-11/hmd-form.pdf) for
people applying for social housing with a medical or disability need.

The form has 3 separate parts.

  * You complete [ Part 1 of the form ](https://kildarecoco.ie/Forms/Housing/HMDForm%201%20Part%201.pdf)
  * Your healthcare professional completes [ Part 2 of the form ](https://kildarecoco.ie/Forms/Housing/HMDForm%201%20Part%202.pdf)
  * Another healthcare professional completes [ Part 3 of the form ](https://kildarecoco.ie/Forms/Housing/HMDForm%201%20Part%203.pdf)

The 3 parts of the form should then be submitted to your local authority
together.

This is a standardised form that you can get from [ your local authority
](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/942f74-local-authorities/) .
