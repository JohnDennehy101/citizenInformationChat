##  How do I apply for social housing?

To apply for local authority housing, download an application form from [ your
local authority's ](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/942f74-local-
authorities/) website, or contact your local authority's housing department
and ask for an application form. An [ Easy to Read Guide (pdf)
](https://www.housingagency.ie/sites/default/files/2022-03/Easy%20to%20Read%20Guide%20to%20Filling%20in%20the%20Social%20Housing%20Support%20Application%20Form%202022%20FINAL.pdf)
to filling in the application form is also available.

You will need to provide additional documentation with your application form.
For example, you need to include photo identification, proof of address and
proof of income. There is more information about proof of income below.

You no longer need to get a HPL1 form stamped by Revenue when completing your
social housing application, as the local authority now checks this information
directly with Revenue. The application form has a checklist that includes
details of all additional documents you need.
