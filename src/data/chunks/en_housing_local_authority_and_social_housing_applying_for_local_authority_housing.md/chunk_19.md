###  If you get a local authority home

Local authority rents are based on a system called differential rents. This
means the rent is based on your ability to pay, so if your income is low, your
rent will be low; and if your income increases, your rent will increase also.
The income of any other adult members of your household will be included in
the rent calculation and there may be deductions for any children in your
family. Each local authority operates its own rent scheme. Contact [ your
local authority ](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/942f74-local-authorities/)
for the details of their differential rent scheme.

Your local authority may have a minimum or maximum rent, which may depend on
the size of your home. There is also a hardship clause that gives local
authorities discretion to reduce the rent if there are particular reasons to
do this.

If your income or the income of anyone in your household changes, you must
inform the local authority, so that it can recalculate your rent.  

Local authority housing is unfurnished. If you are offered a local authority
home and you do not have and cannot afford to buy furniture or appliances, you
may be eligible for [ help under the Supplementary Welfare Allowance Scheme
