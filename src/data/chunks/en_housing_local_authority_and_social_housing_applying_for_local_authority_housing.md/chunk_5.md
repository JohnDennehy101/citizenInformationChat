###  **1\. You must have a have a long-term right to remain in Ireland**

To qualify, you must have a **legal right to remain in the State** on a long-
term basis.

This means that people who have temporary protection, such as Ukrainians
fleeing the war, cannot apply for social housing. This is because their right
to remain in Ireland is not long-term.

If you are in this situation, our [ Coming to Ireland from Ukraine
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/moving-country/asylum-seekers-and-
refugees/the-asylum-process-in-ireland/coming-to-ireland-from-ukraine/#4583cd)
page has information about accommodation and social welfare supports for you.

The rules about access to social housing supports for non-Irish nationals are
available in [ Circular Housing 41/2012.

social-housing-supports-for-non-irish-nationals/)
