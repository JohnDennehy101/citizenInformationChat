##  Free eye tests with the medical card

If you have a [ medical card ](/en/health/medical-cards-and-gp-visit-
cards/medical-card/) , you can get a free eye examination every 2 years from
the HSE. If you need glasses or spectacles, you can get free standard
spectacles.

If you have a medical condition that means you need an eye exam more often
than every two years, these eye exams are also free.

You must apply to your [ Local Health Office
](https://www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/1/lho/) for all eye exams and
dispensing.
