##  Eye health professionals explained

**An Optometrist** examine your eyes to test for vision problems. They use
instruments to examine eye health and to test your visual acuity, depth and
colour perception and your ability to focus and co-ordinate your eyes.
Optometrists can also prescribe spectacles and contact lenses.

**A Dispensing Optician** cannot prescribe prescription spectacles or contact
lenses for you but they can advise you on glasses frames, lenses and contact
lenses for your prescription and your lifestyle.
