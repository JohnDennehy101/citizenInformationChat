##  An example showing how to calculate benefit and privilege

**Example 1**

A one-parent family with 4 children. Two of the children are still in school,
one child in an apprenticeship and the claimant (that is, the person aged 24
or under who is applying for Supplementary Welfare Allowance).

Parent’s net weekly income €590  
Less deductions from net income* _€630  
_ Total -€40

*Less weekly mortgage repayments of €100 and weekly disregard for children of €60 (€30 x 2 children) and one-parent standard weekly allowance of €470 (€100 + €60 + €470 = €630). 

In this case, parental income of €590 is less than the total amount of
deductions, which is €630. Therefore, parental income is assessed as NIL and
will not affect the Supplementary Welfare Allowance claim.

**Example 2**

If we take the same situation of a one-parent family with 4 children. Two of
the children are still in school, one child in an apprenticeship and the
fourth is the claimant (that is, the person aged 24 or under who is applying
for Supplementary Welfare Allowance). If we increase the parent's income to
€800 per week, benefit and privilege is calculated as follows:

Parent’s net weekly income €800  
Less deductions from net income* _€630_  
Total €170

*Less weekly mortgage repayments of €100 and weekly disregard for children of €60 (€30 x 2 children) and one-parent standard weekly allowance of €470 (€100 + €60 + €470 = €630). 

34% of the above total of €170 = €58 (rounded up from €57.80)

Maximum weekly Supplementary Welfare Allowance payment €129.70 less €58 =
€71.70 (see 'Note' below)

**Amount of Supplementary Welfare Allowance** **payable to claimant = €71.70**

**Note:** People under 25 get an age related rate of Supplementary Welfare
Allowance. More information on the SWA rates for people under 25 can be found
in our document on [ Supplementary Welfare Allowance ](/en/social-
welfare/supplementary-welfare-schemes/supplementary-welfare-allow/) .
