##  Introduction

If you have debt you have not repaid, what happens can depend on the type of
debt it is. For some types of debt, there are particular rules. These include
debts due to:

  * Taxes 
  * Social welfare overpayment 
  * Legal obligations, such as maintenance payments 
  * Local authority rent or mortgages 
  * Utility charges 
  * Charges set by law (known as statutory charges), such as TV licences or dog licences 
  * Court fines
