###  Local Property Tax

If you are a _liable person_ for Local Property Tax (LPT) and you do not make
a return, Revenueâ€™s estimate will become payable by default. A liable person
means the person responsible for paying. Revenue will then collect the amount
due in the normal ways, such as deduction at source or attachment order.

If Revenue cannot collect the amount of LPT due, then a charge will be put on
your property. You will not be able to sell your property without paying the
accumulated tax together with interest and, penalties (if applicable).

If you are responsible for paying [ Local Property Tax ](/en/money-and-
tax/tax/housing-taxes-and-reliefs/local-property-tax/) (LPT), and you do not
make a return, you will owe the amount that is estimated by Revenue.

If you do not pay the tax, Revenue may collect it by:

  * Deducting it from your salary or pension 
  * Keeping any refund of tax you are entitled to 
  * Adding a surcharge to your income tax or Capital Gains Tax 
  * Using a solicitor or sheriff 

If Revenue cannot collect the amount of LPT due, then a charge will be put on
your property. This means that you will not be able to sell your property
without paying the tax and any interest or penalties due.
