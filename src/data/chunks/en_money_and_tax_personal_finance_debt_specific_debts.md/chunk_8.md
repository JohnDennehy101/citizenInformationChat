###  Non-Principal Private Residence Charge

The [ Non-Principal Private Residence (NPPR) ](https://www.nppr.ie/) Charge on
second homes was introduced in 2009 and paid to the relevant local authority.
From 2014 onwards, the NPPR is no longer charged, but outstanding liabilities
and payments will still be collected.

After 12 years the charges expire and so are no longer due to be paid. If
there was an NPPR charge on a property for 2009, it expired on 1 August 2021.
Charges for the years 2010â€“2013 expire on 1 April. An NPPR charge for 2010,
for example, expired on 1 April 2022 and the charge for 2013 will expire on 1
April 2025. For more information see [ nppr.ie ](https://www.nppr.ie/) .
