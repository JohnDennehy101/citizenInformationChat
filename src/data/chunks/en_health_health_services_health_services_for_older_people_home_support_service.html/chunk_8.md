###  What services will I get?

The services that are provided vary, depending on individual needs. For
example, they may include help with everyday tasks such as getting in and out
of bed, bathing and dressing. When you apply, the HSE arranges an assessment
of the kinds of support you may need. This is called the Care Needs
Assessment.

The HSE will occasionally review the services you are receiving and may
increase or decrease the supports you are getting, depending on your care
needs, or the supports may remain the same. If your situation changes, you
must notify the local HSE Home Support Office if this affects your need for
home support.
