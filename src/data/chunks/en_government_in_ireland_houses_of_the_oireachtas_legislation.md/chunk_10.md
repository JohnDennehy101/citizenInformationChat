##  The President and legislation

Once the Bill has been passed by both Houses, the Taoiseach presents a copy of
the Bill to [ the President ](/en/government-in-ireland/houses-of-the-
oireachtas/president-introduction-to-the-president-of-ireland/) for signature.
Once the President has signed the Bill it becomes an Act. Some Acts require a
commencement order or orders before they have full legal force.

If the President considers that the new Bill may conflict with the [
Constitution ](/en/government-in-ireland/irish-constitution-1/constitution-
introduction/) , they may, after consultation with the Council of State, refer
the [ question of the Billâ€™s constitutionality ](/en/government-in-
ireland/how-government-works/standards-and-accountability/unconstitutional-
legislation-and-decisions/) to the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court must then
decide whether the Bill is constitutional. If the Supreme Court finds that the
Bill, or any part of the Bill, is unconstitutional, the President cannot sign
it into law.
