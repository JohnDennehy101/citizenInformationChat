##  Secondary legislation

Some Acts of the Oireachtas allow for regulations to be made by a Minister,
local authority, or some other body, to add details about how a particular
provision will operate in practice. These regulations are secondary
legislation. A Minister makes regulations by signing a Statutory Instrument
(SI). Local authorities pass bye-laws to make regulations for their local
authority areas.
