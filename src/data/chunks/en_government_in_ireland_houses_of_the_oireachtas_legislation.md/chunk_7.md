###  Third stage – Committee Stage

Next, each individual section of the Bill is debated. This is often carried
out by an Oireachtas Committee in the Dáil. Members discuss proposed
amendments with the relevant Minister. The Minister decides on whether to
accept or reject an amendment. If an amendment is rejected by the Minister, a
vote can then be called.

The Committee State can be lengthy because there is no limit on the number of
times a member can speak on an amendment.
