###  Fourth state – Report Stage

This is the last opportunity for amendments to the Bill. Members can only
speak twice on each amendment, and their second speech is limited to two
minutes. No new amendments can be added by members outside the Government –
only amendments from Committee Stage are discussed.

The Government can add new amendments at the Report Stage, but only by
returning the Bill to Committee Stage.
