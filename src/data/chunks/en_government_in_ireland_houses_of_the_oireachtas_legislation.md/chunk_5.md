###  First stage

The Bill is initiated. How this works differs depending on who is introducing
the Bill:

  * A Government Minister or the Leader of the Seanad can introduce a Bill and it automatically passes to the second stage 
  * Groups of 7 TDs or 5 Senators can introduce a Bill and it automatically passes to the second stage if certain criteria are met 
  * Any one TD or any three Senators can seek leave to introduce a Bill and whether it proceeds will be voted on by the House.
