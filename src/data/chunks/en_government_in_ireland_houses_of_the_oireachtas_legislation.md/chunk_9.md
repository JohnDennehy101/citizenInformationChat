###  Fifth Stage

This usually follows directly from the Report Stage. The House (either the
Dáil or Seanad) where the Bill was commenced, votes on the Bill.

If the Bill is passed, it then moves to the next House (if it commenced in the
Dáil, it now moves to the Seanad) where it goes through all 5 stages again.
Amendments made in the second House can be rejected by the first House after a
debate.

The Seanad has only 21 days to consider money bills.
