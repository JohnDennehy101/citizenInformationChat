##  Stages of legislation

A Bill may begin (be _commenced_ ) in either the Dáil or the Seanad but it
must be passed by both Houses to become law. Usually, Bills are commenced in [
Dáil Eireann ](/en/government-in-ireland/houses-of-the-oireachtas/dail-
eireann/) . Money Bills (for tax or spending by the Government) or Bills to
amend the Constitution cannot be commenced in the [ Seanad ](/en/government-
in-ireland/houses-of-the-oireachtas/the-seanad/) .

Bills are either commenced by a Minister of State (Government Bills) or by a
TD or Senator who is not part of the Government (Private Member’s Bills). Once
it is drafted, a Bill must go through 5 stages before it becomes law.
