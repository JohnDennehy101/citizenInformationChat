##  Can my contract be changed?

All employees in Ireland must get a _written statement_ of their terms of
employment, including their pay and hours of work. You can usually find this
in your [ contract of employment
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/employment/employment-rights-and-
conditions/contracts-of-employment/contract-of-employment/) .

There are 2 main ways your contract can change:

  * Due to a change in the law, or 
  * By agreement between you and your employer 

Your employer cannot change your contract without your agreement.
