##  Responding to proposed changes to your contract

If your employer wants to make a significant change to your contract you
should:

  1. Request written details of the proposed change 
  2. Ask for a review date when the change can be reconsidered 
  3. Respond in writing to say whether you agree or disagree with the change 

If you agree with the change, you should tell your employer your acceptance is
temporary. At the review date, you can ask to return to your original terms
and conditions.
