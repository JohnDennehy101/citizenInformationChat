###  Taking your complaint further

If you cannot resolve the problem with your employer, you can complain to the
[ Workplace Relations Commission ](/en/employment/enforcement-and-
redress/workplace-relations-commission/) using their [ online complaint form
](https://www.workplacerelations.ie/en/e-complaint_form/) .

You should make your complaint within 6 months of the dispute or complaint
taking place. This time limit can be extended for a further 6 months, but only
if you have a reasonable cause for not bringing the complaint within the
normal time limit.
