##  Changes to work practices

Your employer cannot change your contract without your agreement, but they can
change your work practices.

Legally, there is a difference between contractual terms and work practices.

**Contractual terms**

_Contractual terms_ include your pay, hours of work, sick pay and pension
scheme.

Many of your contractual terms are in the written statement of your [ terms
and conditions of employment
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/employment/employment-rights-and-
conditions/contracts-of-employment/contract-of-employment/) . You may find
other contractual terms in your:

  * Staff handbook 
  * Pension scheme booklet 
  * Collective agreement with your employer 

**Work practices**

Examples of _work practices_ include breaks and rostering. You can find
details of these practices in your staff handbook.

Your employer may change these work practices **without your agreement** . It
is reasonable for an employer to update work practices or processes to save
money or increase efficiency.
