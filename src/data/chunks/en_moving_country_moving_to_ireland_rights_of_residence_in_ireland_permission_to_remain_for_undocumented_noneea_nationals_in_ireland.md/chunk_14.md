##  Decisions and appeals

If your application is approved, you will get a letter granting you permission
to remain in Ireland for 2 years. Each member of your family that was part of
your application will get a separate letter.

You must [ register your permission ](/en/moving-country/moving-to-
ireland/rights-of-residence-in-ireland/registration-of-non-eea-nationals-in-
ireland/) and get an Irish Residence Permit. You will get a Stamp 4, which
means you can work without an employment permit. Children under 16 do not have
to register.

After the 2 years your permission can then be renewed.
