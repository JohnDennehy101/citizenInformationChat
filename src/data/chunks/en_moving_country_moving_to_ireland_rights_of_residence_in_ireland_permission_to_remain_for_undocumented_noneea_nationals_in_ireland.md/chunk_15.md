###  Refusals

If your application is refused, you will get a letter which will tell you the
reasons why it was refused. You can [ appeal this decision
](https://inisonline.jahs.ie/user/login) . If your appeal is successful, you
will be granted permission to remain in Ireland.

If your appeal is not successful, your case will be [ referred to the

since-i-arrived-in-ireland/spouse-civil-partner-of-irish-national-
scheme/repatriation-division/) of ISD. If you have a current outstanding
application for international protection, or some other residency, that will
still be processed if you are refused residence under this scheme.
