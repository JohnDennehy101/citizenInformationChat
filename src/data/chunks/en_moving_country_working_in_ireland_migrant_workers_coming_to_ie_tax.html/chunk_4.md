###  Income from a country with no double taxation agreement

If you have income from a country with no double taxation agreement with
Ireland, you must pay tax in Ireland on the income minus the foreign tax you
paid. There is no credit available for the foreign tax you paid that can be
deducted from your Irish tax liability.
