##  Residence for tax

If you have income from more than one country and move to Ireland, where you
pay tax depends on a number of factors:

  * Your residence for tax purposes 
  * Your domicile 

Your [ residence for tax purposes ](/en/money-and-tax/tax/moving-country-and-
taxation/tax-residence-and-domicile-in-ireland/) depends on the number of days
that you are present in Ireland during a tax year (A tax year runs from 1
January to 31 December). Your domicile is the country where you have your
permanent home.

If you are resident for tax purposes but not domiciled in Ireland, you pay
Irish tax on your Irish income and any foreign income that you remit to
Ireland. You remit income if you send it to Ireland from abroad by wire, mail
or online transfer.

If you intend to live in Ireland for the next calendar year, you can request [
split-year treatment ](https://www.revenue.ie/en/life-events-and-personal-
circumstances/moving-to-or-from-ireland/moving-or-returning-to-ireland/split-
year-treatment-in-your-year-of-arrival.aspx) the year you arrive. This means
you will be treated as resident in Ireland from the date you arrive.
