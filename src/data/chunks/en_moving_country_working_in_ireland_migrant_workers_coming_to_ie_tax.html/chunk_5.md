###  Income earned before moving to Ireland

If you are moving to Ireland for the first time or you are an Irish citizen
returning to live in Ireland and you were not resident or [ ordinarily
resident ](/en/money-and-tax/tax/moving-country-and-taxation/tax-residence-
and-domicile-in-ireland/) when the income was earned:

  * You wonâ€™t have to pay income tax on income earned before the beginning of the tax year that you become resident in Ireland 
  * You will have to pay tax on income other than employment income that you get between the beginning of the tax year and the date of your arrival, if the money is brought into Ireland (unless there is a double taxation agreement that allows for a different treatment).
