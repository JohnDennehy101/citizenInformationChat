####  **Self-employed people**

Self-employed people can also qualify. You are considered self-employed if
you:

  * Run your own business alone or with a partner 
  * Work for someone under a self-employed contract 
  * Run a franchised business as a self-employed person 

Some other specific qualifying criteria apply (see [ Appendix 2 of the
Operational Guidelines ](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/429d6-operational-
guidelines-work-and-
access/#appendices:~:text=Appendix%202%3A%20Establishing%20Employer%20Eligibility,Research%2C%20Innovation%20and%20Science%20\(DFHERIS\).)
).

**Tax compliance**

Employers or self-employed people must provide a tax clearance access number
(TCAN). They must be a legal entity or a charity (or both) recognised by
Revenue.
