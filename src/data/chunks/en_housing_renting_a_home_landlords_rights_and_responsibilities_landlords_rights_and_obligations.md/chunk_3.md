###  Approved housing bodies

[ Approved housing bodies (AHBs) ](/en/housing/local-authority-and-social-
housing/approved-housing-bodies/) are covered by residential tenancies
legislation and have most of the same rights and responsibilities that private
landlords have. However, there are some differences, including the rules on [
rent reviews ](/en/housing/renting-a-home/landlords-rights-and-
responsibilities/rent-increases-in-private-rented-housing/) , [ minimum
standards ](/en/housing/renting-a-home/tenants-rights-and-
responsibilities/minimum-standards-for-rented-homes/) and the landlordâ€™s right
to [ end a tenancy ](/en/housing/renting-a-home/tenants-rights-and-
responsibilities/if-your-landlord-wants-you-to-leave/) .
