###  Refusing a tenancy

The [ Equal Status Acts 2000â€“2015
](http://www.lawreform.ie/_fileupload/RevisedActs/WithAnnotations/HTML/EN_ACT_2000_0008.HTM)
apply to lettings and accommodation. Landlords cannot discriminate against
potential tenants on grounds of gender, civil status, family status, sexual
orientation, religion, age, disability, race or membership of the Traveller
community.

You cannot discriminate against a tenant or potential tenant because they are
getting a [ Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) ](/en/housing/renting-a-
home/help-with-renting/housing-assistance-payment/) , [ Rent Supplement
](/en/social-welfare/supplementary-welfare-schemes/rent-supplement/) or any
other social welfare payment. This means that you cannot state when
advertising accommodation that HAP or Rent Supplement is not accepted and you
cannot refuse to rent accommodation to someone because they are getting a
social welfare payment. Read more on the website of the [ Irish Human Rights
and Equality Commission ](https://www.ihrec.ie/your-rights-old/i-have-an-
