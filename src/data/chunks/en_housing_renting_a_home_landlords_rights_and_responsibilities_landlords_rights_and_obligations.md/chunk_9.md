###  Ending a tenancy

If you want to end a tenancy, you must serve the tenant with a valid written [
Notice of Termination
](http://staging.citizensinformation.ie/en/housing/renting_a_home/if_your_landlord_wants_you_to_leave.html#lab681)
and give them the [ correct amount of notice ](/en/housing/renting-a-home/if-
your-landlord-wants-you-to-leave#la1b6d) . You must send a copy of this Notice
of Termination along with a completed [ Notice of Termination Return Form
(pdf)
](https://www.rtb.ie/images/uploads/forms/RTB_Notice_of_Termination_Return_Form_Nov_2022.pdf)
to the RTB at the same time. If this is not done the notice of termination is
invalid. You can find out more on ending a tenancy the [ RTB's website
