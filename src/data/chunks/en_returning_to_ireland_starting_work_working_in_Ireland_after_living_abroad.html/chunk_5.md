##  Paying tax on your income

When you work in Ireland, you pay tax and charges on your income through the
PAYE (Pay As You Earn) system. You normally pay [ Income tax
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/money_and_tax/tax/income_tax/) , [ Pay
Related Social Insurance (PRSI) ](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-
system/social-insurance-prsi/paying-social-insurance/) and [ Universal Social
Charge (USC) ](/en/money-and-tax/tax/income-tax/universal-social-charge/) .

When you start a new job, take the following steps to make sure you get paid
on time and avoid paying emergency tax:

  * Give your employer your PPS number 
  * Make sure you are registered for Pay As You Earn (PAYE) in [ myAccount ](https://www.ros.ie/myaccount-web/home.html) on the Revenue website 
  * Register your new job with Revenue’s Jobs and Pensions service [ in myAccount ](https://www.ros.ie/myaccount-web/sign_in.html) . (You only need to register your first job. If you change job, you don’t need to register your new job on myAccount).
