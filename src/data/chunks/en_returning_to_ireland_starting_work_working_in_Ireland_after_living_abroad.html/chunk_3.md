##  Finding and getting a job

Try to start your job search before you come home to Ireland. Some employers
hire people directly from overseas. You will need to:

  * prepare your [ CV (resumé) ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/employment/starting-work-and-changing-job/training-and-looking-for-work/finding-and-getting-a-job/#ff365e)
  * organise your references, and 
  * do some research on pay and conditions in Ireland. 

If you want to work in Ireland and your qualification is from another country,
you may need to get your qualification recognised in Ireland. You should get
your [ foreign qualification recognised
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/returning-to-ireland/education-and-
schooling/getting-your-foreign-qualification-recognised-in-ireland/) before
you apply for a job.

You can use the [ Jobs Ireland ](https://www.jobsireland.ie/#/home) website to
search for jobs, or visit our page ‘ [ Finding a job
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/employment/starting-work-and-changing-
job/training-and-looking-for-work/finding-and-getting-a-job/) ’ for
