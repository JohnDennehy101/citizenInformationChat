###  Objections to the court poor box

The Law Reform Commission published a [ report on the court poor box (pdf)
](http://www.lawreform.ie/_fileupload/Reports/rCourtPoorBox.pdf) in 2005 and
found that the system is unfair for offenders from different economic
backgrounds.

Offenders who can afford to pay the fine can avoid conviction, while people
who cannot afford to pay the fine have no choice but to have the conviction
registered against them. The court poor box is also not universally used, so
some offenders may not have the option available to them depending on where
they are tried.

There are also concerns as to the lack of accountability regarding the use of
funds, as well as concerns that donations to the court poor box deprive the
Irish Government of the fines that would normally be imposed. It has been
suggested that a new system where the money collected went to victims of crime
would be more appropriate.
