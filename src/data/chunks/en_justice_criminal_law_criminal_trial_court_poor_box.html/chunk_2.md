##  What is the court poor box?

In criminal prosecutions heard in lower courts (usually the [ District Court
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/justice/courts-system/district-court/)
), the [ judge
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/justice/courtroom/judge/) may order
the defendant to place a donation in the court poor box in lieu of conviction.

This means that instead of being convicted and facing a prison sentence or a
statutory fine, the defendant donates a sum of money to a charity decided by
the judge.

The sum can vary in amount, depending on the offence. This donation is then
lodged by the defendant with the court and paid over by the [ Court Service
](https://www.courts.ie/content/general-information) to the charity.
