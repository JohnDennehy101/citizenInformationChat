##  Exhumation

It is only in strict circumstances that [ exhumation ](/en/death/sudden-or-
unexplained-death/exhumation-of-the-remains-of-a-deceased-person/) occurs.
Some examples of situations where an exhumation of interred remains from a
burial ground might be take place include:

  * If the family of the deceased person requests that the remains be moved to another burial ground 
  * For public health reasons (for example, if a graveyard or cemetery is being moved) 
  * When a court orders an exhumation as part of a criminal investigation 

At all times during the process, due regard for respect to the deceased
person, other interred remains in the burial ground or graveyard and privacy
of the family and friends of the deceased person is protected.
