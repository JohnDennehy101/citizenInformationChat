##  Burial at sea

The Department of Transport has developed [ guidelines for those considering
burial at sea ](https://www.gov.ie/en/service/de81b8-burial-at-sea/) . These
guidelines are based on previous experience and seek to prevent distressing
situations, such as where a body is returned to shore.

The guidelines recommend that you should consider [ cremation
](/en/death/practical-arrangements-after-a-death/cremations/) and scattering
the ashes at sea rather than burial.

In the event of burial, the guidelines make recommendations about matters such
as:

  * Location of the burial 
  * Design and construction of the coffin 
  * Preparation of the deceased 

See â€˜Further information' below for contact details of the Irish Maritime
Directorate within the Department of Transport.
