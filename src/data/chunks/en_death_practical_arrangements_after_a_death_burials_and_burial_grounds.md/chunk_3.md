##  Purchasing a burial plot

Many funeral directors offer to handle the purchase of burial plots as part of
their package of funeral services. Or, you can contact your local authority
and they can tell you how to purchase a plot.

The cost of buying a burial plot varies. If you hire funeral directors to
arrange the purchase for you, they will indicate how much the burial plot
costs as part of the overall expense of a funeral.

Many burial grounds or graveyards are already full, and there may be
restrictions on the pre-purchase or buying in advance of burial plots, such as
limiting advance buying to those over 65 years of age.
