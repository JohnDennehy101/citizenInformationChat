##  Looking after burial grounds

Graveyards are maintained either by caretakers hired by the local authority or
by volunteer groups. If you want to start or join a voluntary cemetery
maintenance group your local authority may be able to help you.

These groups are often supported by burial ground maintenance grants. This
grant helps towards the cost of the groups' activities, which may include
grass cutting, planting, weed control and the maintenance of gates and walls.
