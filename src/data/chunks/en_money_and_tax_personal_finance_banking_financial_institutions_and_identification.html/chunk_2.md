##  Introduction

When you are [ opening an account with a financial institution ](/en/money-
and-tax/personal-finance/banking/opening-a-bank-account/) such as a bank or
credit union, it must establish proof of your identity. This requirement is
set down in [ anti-money laundering legislation ](/en/money-and-tax/personal-
finance/banking/money-laundering-in-ireland/) .

The Central Bank has an explainer on [ why you must prove your identity when
opening a bank account ](https://centralbank.ie/consumer-hub/explainers/why-
