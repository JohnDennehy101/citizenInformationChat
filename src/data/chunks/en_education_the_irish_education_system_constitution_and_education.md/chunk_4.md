###  The Family

Article 41 of the Irish Constitution says:

"1.1°: The State recognises the Family as the natural primary and fundamental
unit group of Society, and as a moral institution possessing inalienable and
imprescriptible rights, antecedent and superior to all positive law.

1.2°: The State, therefore, guarantees to protect the Family in its
constitution and authority, as the necessary basis of social order and as
indispensable to the welfare of the Nation and the State."
