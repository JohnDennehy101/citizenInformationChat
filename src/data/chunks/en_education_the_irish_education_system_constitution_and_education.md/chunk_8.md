###  Religion in schools

Article 44 of the Constitution says that:

  * There cannot be discrimination between the different religious denominations, and 
  * Children have the right to attend state-aided schools without attending religious instruction. 

Some time periods may be set aside for religious instruction and parents have
a right to withdraw their child from this. However, in practice, the school
ethos can also affect other parts of school life.
