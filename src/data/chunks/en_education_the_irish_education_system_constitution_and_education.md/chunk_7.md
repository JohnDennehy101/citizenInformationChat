###  **Responsibility for education**

Articles 41 and 42 of the Constitution say that:

  * The family is the main source of education for the child. Parents are entitled to provide education outside the school system if they wish. 
  * The State can not force parents to send their children to any school or any particular kind of school. Parents can choose the school they want to send their children to. There is no constitutional obligation on any school to accept individual children. 
  * The State may require that children receive a certain minimum education. This certain minimum has not yet been defined in legislation or in official policy. 
  * The State must provide for free primary education. It does not have to provide that education directly, but it can. In practice, there are some State schools but most primary schools are privately owned and largely state funded. See [ ownership of primary schools ](/en/education/primary-and-post-primary-education/going-to-primary-school/ownership-of-primary-schools/)
