##  More information

You may need to prove that you have recovered from COVID-19 or have been [
vaccinated for COVID-19 ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/health/health-
services/vaccinations/vaccines-for-covid19/) if you wish to travel abroad.

You can no longer get an [ EU Digital COVID Certificate (DCC) ](/en/travel-
and-recreation/travel-abroad/digital-covid-certificate#l247f3) . However, the
HSE will still give you evidence of your COVID-19 vaccination after you have
been vaccinated.

If you want more information about COVID-19 vaccination certificates, visit
the [ HSE website ](https://www.hse.ie/eng/) or call HSElive on 1800 700 700.
