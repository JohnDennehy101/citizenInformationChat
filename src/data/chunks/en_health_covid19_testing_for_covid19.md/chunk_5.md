###  Can I get a COVID-19 test for travelling?

COVID-19 tests for [ travel abroad ](/en/travel-and-recreation/travel-
abroad/travelling-abroad-during-covid/) are not provided in the public health
system. Airlines will not accept a HSE test result for travel. If you need a
letter for travel, you need to have a negative test from a private company.
