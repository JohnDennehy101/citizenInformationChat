##  Introduction

Paying social insurance can help you to qualify for social insurance payments,
such as the State Pension (Contributory). If you are an employee Pay Related
Social Insurance (PRSI) deductions are made from your earnings each week.

If you are no longer an employee or if you are self-employed and you are no
longer making compulsory PRSI contributions, you can opt to make voluntary
contributions. If you are getting a social welfare payment or [ signing for
credits ](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/social-insurance-
prsi/credited-social-insurance-contributions/) you may get credited
contributions which will also keep your social insurance record up to date.

Voluntary contributions can help maintain your social insurance record and
help you to qualify for social insurance payments in the future. They cover
long-term benefits such as pensions. They do not cover short-term benefits for
illness, maternity or jobseekers.

You can pay voluntary contributions if you:

  * Are no longer covered by compulsory PRSI in Ireland 
  * Are no longer covered by PRSI on a compulsory or voluntary basis in another EU country 
  * Meet the age conditions - see below
