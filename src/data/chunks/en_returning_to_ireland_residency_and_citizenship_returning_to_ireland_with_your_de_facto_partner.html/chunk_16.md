##  Step 5: After residency permission is granted

Your partner will get a registration certificate called an [ Irish Residence
Permit (IRP) ](https://www.irishimmigration.ie/registering-your-immigration-
permission/information-on-registering/irish-residence-permit/) . This is a
credit card sized plastic card that displays basic information about the card
holder.

After permission is granted, your non-EEA partner must inform ISD of any
change of address within 2 days of moving. Also, if their family circumstances
change (for example, if your relationship breaks down) they must inform ISD.
