####  **If residency permission is not granted**

If a Stamp 4 is not issued (this can happen if there are any issues that need
to be clarified such as identity, criminal history, or relationship history),
your partner may be asked to make a written application for residency to ISD.
Your partner is not entitled to work in Ireland until a Stamp 4 has been
issued.
