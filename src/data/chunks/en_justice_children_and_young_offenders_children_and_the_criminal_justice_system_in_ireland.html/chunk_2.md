##  Introduction

Children are one of the most vulnerable groups in society. The law protects
children until they are deemed to be able to interact in society as adults.
For this reason, children are treated differently from adults by the criminal
justice system.

The law dealing with children who are found in breach of the criminal law, is
contained in the [ Children Act, 2001
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2001/en/act/pub/0024/index.html) which was
amended by the [ Criminal Justice Act 2006
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2006/en/act/pub/0026/index.html) , the [
Children (Amendment) Act 2015
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2015/act/45/enacted/en/print.html) and
other acts.

The Children Act 2001 Act tries to ensure that children in conflict with the
law are only detained (custody) by the State as a last resort. Community-based
measures must be tried by the State before detention can be considered.
