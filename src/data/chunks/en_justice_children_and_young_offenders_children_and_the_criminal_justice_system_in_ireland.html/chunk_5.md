###  **Exceptions to the age of criminal responsibility**

Children aged 10 or 11 can be charged with murder, manslaughter, rape or
aggravated sexual assault.

**What about children under 12?**

Children under 12 years of age do not have total immunity from action being
taken against them.

The Gardaí have a responsibility to take a child under 12 years of age to
their parents or guardian, where they have reasonable grounds for believing
that the child has committed an offence with which the child cannot be charged
due to the child’s age.

Where this is not possible, the Gardaí will arrange for the child to be taken
into the custody of the [ Child and Family Agency (Tusla)
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/birth-family-relationships/services-
and-supports-for-children/tusla-the-child-and-family-agency/) for the area in
which the child normally lives. This is under [ Section 53 of the Act
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2001/en/act/pub/0024/sec0053.html) as amended
by Section 130 of the Criminal Justice Act 2006.
