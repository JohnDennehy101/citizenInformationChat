##  Spent convictions of children

If a child commits an offence and is found guilty, this can be automatically
removed from the record as if never committed, if the following conditions are
met:

  * The offence was committed before the child reached the age of 18 years 
  * The offence is not one required to be tried by the Central Criminal Court (such as murder or rape) 
  * At least 3 years have passed since the child was found guilty and 
  * The child has not been dealt with for another offence in that 3-year period 

If these conditions are met, they are no longer regarded under Irish law as
having committed an offence. The spent conviction also applies if they have
received a caution or have been dealt with under the Probation of Offenders
Act 1907.

When looking for employment or applying for an educational course or
insurance, they can claim to have a clean record.

However, if they are travelling or emigrating to a country such as the USA or
Australia, they are subject to that countryâ€™s immigration laws and may have to
disclose such convictions.

[ Section 258 of the Children Act 2001
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2001/en/act/pub/0024/sec0258.html#sec258)
covers spent convictions.
