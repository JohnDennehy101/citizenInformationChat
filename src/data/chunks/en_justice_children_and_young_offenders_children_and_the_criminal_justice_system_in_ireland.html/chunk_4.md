##  Age of criminal responsibility

The age of criminal responsibility is 12 years of age. This means that
children who have not reached the age of 12 years generally cannot be charged
with an offence.

If the child is aged under 14 years when charged with an offence, no further
proceedings can be taken without the consent of the [ Director of Public
Prosecutions ](http://www.dppireland.ie/) .

The laws covering the age of criminal responsibility are [ Section 52 of the
Children Act 2001
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2001/en/act/pub/0024/sec0052.html#partv-
sec52) as amended by Section 129 of the [ Criminal Justice Act 2006
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2006/act/26/enacted/en/html) .

The age of criminal responsibility was raised from 7 years of age to 12 years
of age in 2006.
