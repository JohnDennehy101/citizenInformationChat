###  How does the Back for Business programme work?

Back for Business is based on a model of peer support. This is where [
volunteer Lead Entrepreneurs ](https://www.backforbusiness.com/lead-
entrepreneurs/) share their experience of starting and growing a business in
Ireland with people who are in the early stages of starting a business.

The scheme runs for 6 months and involves interactive sessions (facilitated by
the Lead Entrepreneurs) that focus on achieving goals and milestones for your
business. The aim of the programme is to support you to address challenges in
starting, developing and positioning your business for sustainability and
growth. You must meet with your group and Lead Entrepreneur once per month
over the 6 months. There are also a range of other information sessions to
help you understand the system for entrepreneurs in Ireland.

If you are selected, you are expected to attend all events. Read about [
businesses that completed previous progammes

entrepreneurs ](https://www.backforbusiness.com/lead-entrepreneurs/) on the
Back for Business website.
