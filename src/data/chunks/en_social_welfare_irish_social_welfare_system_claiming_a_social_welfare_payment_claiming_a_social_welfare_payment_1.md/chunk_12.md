###  How social welfare decisions are made  

Deciding Officers are employed by the Department of Social Protection to
accept or reject claims made in Ireland for social welfare payments. Deciding
officers are given the power to make these decisions through the Social
Welfare Consolidation Act 2005 as amended and other social welfare
legislation.

Before making a claim or applying for a social welfare payment you must
complete the application form. The application form will ask for various
details, such as your name, address, PPS number, income etc. These details
will help the Department of Social Protection to process your application and
if your claim is successful, to arrange your payment.

As part of the application process, you must also provide supporting
documentation to prove that the information you have given on the application
form is correct. For example, a payslip to show your employment income.

To qualify for a social welfare payment, you must meet all the qualifying
criteria for that payment. Different social welfare payments have different
qualifying criteria. It is your responsibility to prove to the Department that
you qualify for the payment you have applied for.

If you are applying for a payment due to an illness or disability your doctor
must fill in part of the application from. If you are in work, your employer
may have to fill in a part of the form.
