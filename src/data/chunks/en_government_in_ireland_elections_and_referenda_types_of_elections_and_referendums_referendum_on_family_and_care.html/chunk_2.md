##  What is a referendum?

A constitutional referendum allows Irish citizens to decide whether or not to
change the wording of the Irish Constitution. [ The Irish Constitution
(Bunreacht na hÉireann) ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/government-in-
ireland/irish-constitution-1/constitution-introduction/) is the legal document
that sets out how Ireland should be governed.

On Friday, 8 March 2024, Irish citizens were asked to decide if changes should
be made to Article 41 of the [ Irish Constitution ](/en/government-in-
ireland/irish-constitution-1/constitution-introduction/) \- see 'Referendum
results' below.

The proposed changes were also called the _Family Amendment_ and the _Care
Amendment_ – for more information see ‘What was I asked to decide on?’ below.
