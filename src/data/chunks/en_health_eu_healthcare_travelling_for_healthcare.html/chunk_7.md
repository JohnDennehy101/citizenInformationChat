##  Cross-Border Healthcare Directive

If you are entitled to health services that are publicly funded and available
in Ireland, you can choose to get those services in another EU or EEA country
under the [ Cross-Border Healthcare Directive ](/en/health/eu-
healthcare/cross-border-directive/) .

The rules for the Cross-Border Healthcare Directive include:

  * The treatment abroad can be in public or private healthcare. 
  * Some types of treatment need to be authorised in advance. 
  * You pay for the healthcare and then apply for a refund. 
  * You need the same kind of referral for healthcare abroad as you would for healthcare in Ireland, for example, from a GP (family doctor) or hospital consultant. 
  * Travel costs and living expenses abroad are not covered.
