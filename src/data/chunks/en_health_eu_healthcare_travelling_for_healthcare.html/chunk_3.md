###  **Planned health care in Europe**

If you are planning to get healthcare abroad, you can get it under the [
Treatment Abroad Scheme ](/en/health/eu-healthcare/treatment-abroad-scheme/)
or the [ Cross-Border Healthcare Directive ](/en/health/eu-healthcare/cross-
border-directive/) .

  * The Cross-Border Healthcare Directive only covers treatments that **are** **available in Ireland**
  * The Treatment Abroad Scheme covers treatments that **are not available in Ireland** . 

It is important to apply under the correct scheme.

If a treatment is covered by the Treatment Abroad Scheme, you cannot get a
refund for it under the Cross-Border Healthcare Directive.

The differences between the schemes are summarised below, with links to more
detailed information.
