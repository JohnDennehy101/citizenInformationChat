###  What is general rubbish?

Your general waste includes items that cannot be recycled or composted and
must be sent to landfill. You should check if your rubbish can be recycled or
go to organic waste. General rubbish is sometimes called ‘black bin’ waste.

[ From 1 September 2023 ](https://www.gov.ie/en/press-
release/75262-introduction-of-new-environment-levies-will-incentivise-
recycling-and-help-ireland-meet-our-eu-waste-targets/) , there is a waste
recovery levy of €10 per tonne and a €10 increase to the existing "landfill
levy" to €85 per tonne. This is paid by your refuse collection company, but it
may mean an increase in the fees paid by you. Check with your waste company to
see if there is an increase to the cost of collecting your bins.
