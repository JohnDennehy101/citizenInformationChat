##  Introduction

If you are an employee, you usually pay tax through Pay As You Earn (PAYE).
This means that your employer deducts your tax from your salary. PAYE is also
used if you are getting an [ occupational pension ](/en/money-and-
tax/personal-finance/pensions/occupational-pensions/) .

If you are a PAYE worker or pensioner and you also have another source of
income, this page explains how to report that income to Revenue.

If the income is over a certain amount, you make a tax return under the self-
assessment system.
