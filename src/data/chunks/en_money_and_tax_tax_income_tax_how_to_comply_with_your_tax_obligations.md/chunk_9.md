##  How to make a tax return if you do not have to use self-assessment

If you have non-PAYE income that you do not have to self-assess, you use Form

  * Fill out a [ paper Form 12 (pdf) ](http://www.revenue.ie/en/tax/it/forms/form12.pdf) and send it to Revenue 
  * Complete the online Form 12 – this electronic form is available through [ Revenue's myAccount service ](https://www.ros.ie/myaccount-web/home.html)
  * Fill out [ Form 12S (pdf) ](https://www.revenue.ie/en/self-assessment-and-self-employment/documents/form-12s.pdf) – this is a simplified tax return for PAYE taxpayers
