##  Introduction

If you have a dispute with a company in Ireland or elsewhere in the EU you
should first try to solve the problem directly with the company.

If this fails, you may take your case to court. [ The Small Claims Court
](/en/justice/courts-system/small-claims-court/) is particularly useful for
claims worth under â‚¬2,000.

Another option is to use alternative dispute resolution (ADR). Some businesses
belong to an ADR scheme that can help you solve your problem without having to
go to court.

The term ADR covers a wide variety of processes aimed at resolving disputes
out-of-court. They include mediation, arbitration and conciliation. The
process involves an independent third party helping you and the business to
reach a resolution on your dispute.

Organisations that provide alternative ways of resolving serious disputes are
called alternative dispute resolution (ADR) organisations.
