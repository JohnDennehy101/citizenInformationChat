###  Regulators

Regulators are bodies set up by law to oversee specific sectors to make sure
they comply with the law. In Ireland, there are regulators looking after
utilities and financial services.

For example, [ ComReg ](https://www.comreg.ie/) regulates the
telecommunications and postal sector, the [ Commission for Regulation of
Utilities ](https://www.cru.ie/) regulates the gas, electricity and water
suppliers and the [ Central Bank ](https://www.centralbank.ie/) regulates the
financial services sector.
