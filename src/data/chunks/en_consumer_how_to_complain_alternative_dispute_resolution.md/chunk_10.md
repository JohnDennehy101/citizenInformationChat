###  Ombudsmen

There are Ombudsman schemes that cover many different services such as
financial or utilities as well as organisations such as public authorities. If
you have already gone through the trader’s internal complaints process and the
issue is still not resolved, you may be able to use an Ombudsman if you feel
you have been unfairly treated or that your consumer rights have been
breached.

Ombudsman schemes can use more informal methods to resolve a complaint
including conciliation or mediation. In other cases, it may start a formal
investigation and issue a recommendation or ruling. Some decisions can be
legally binding.

There are a number of Ombudsmen schemes available, including:

  * [ The Ombudsman for Children ](/en/birth-family-relationships/children-s-rights-and-policy/the-ombudsman-for-children/) – for complaints made by children or on behalf of children against certain public bodies such as schools or hospitals 
  * [ The Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman (FSPO) ](/en/money-and-tax/personal-finance/pensions/making-a-pension-complaint/) – for complaints about financial service providers 
  * [ The Office of the Ombudsman ](/en/government-in-ireland/how-government-works/standards-and-accountability/office-of-the-ombudsman/) – for complaints about public service organisations such as government departments, local authorities and the Health Services Executive
