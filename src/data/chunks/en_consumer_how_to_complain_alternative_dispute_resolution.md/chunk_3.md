###  EU Directive on alternative dispute resolution

The right to access alternative dispute resolution processes for consumer
disputes is part of EU law. The [ Competition and Consumer Protection
Commission (CCPC) ](https://www.ccpc.ie/) is responsible for approving
organisations and agencies as _notified_ or authorised ADR bodies. It keeps a
public list of [ authorised ADR bodies ](https://www.ccpc.ie/business/help-
for-business/alternative-dispute-resolution/) .

By law, authorised ADR bodies have to meet strict EU quality criteria which
guarantee that they handle your complaint in an effective, fair, independent
and transparent way.

There are also other organisations that provide informal alternative
resolution services but are not listed as authorised ADR bodies with the CCPC.
It is voluntary for organisations to go through this approval process.

The EU Directive on ADR was brought into Irish law by the [ EU Alternative
Dispute Resolution for Consumer Disputes) Regulations 2015 (SI 343/2015)
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2015/si/343/made/en/print) .
