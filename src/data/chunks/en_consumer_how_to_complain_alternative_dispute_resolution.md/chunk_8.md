##  What are the benefits of using ADR?

The main benefits of ADR are:

  * It is easy to use 
  * Can help solve a problem faster 
  * Usually ADR costs less than going to court 
  * Can be confidential 
  * Can be flexible and provide a range of solutions and outcomes 
  * Helps achieve mutual agreement, that is a solution that both parties are happy with 

ADR may not be suitable in some situations, including when:

  * The outcome needs to be legally binding 
  * The other party is unwilling to take part in ADR
