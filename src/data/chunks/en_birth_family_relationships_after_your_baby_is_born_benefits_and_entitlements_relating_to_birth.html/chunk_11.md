###  Adoptive leave and Adoptive Benefit

[ Adoptive leave ](/en/employment/employment-rights-and-conditions/leave-and-
holidays/adoptive-leave/) is a statutory entitlement for adoptive parents.
Adoptive leave provides 24 weeks’ leave from work to one parent of the
adopting couple or a parent who is adopting alone. The 24 weeks start from the
date the child is placed in your care.

If you have enough PRSI contributions, you may be able to get [ Adoptive
Benefit ](/en/social-welfare/families-and-children/adoptive-benefit/) . It is
available to both employees and self-employed people. If you are an adopting
couple, the parent who does not avail of adoptive leave is entitled to [
paternity leave ](/en/employment/employment-rights-and-conditions/leave-and-
holidays/paternity-leave/) .

You can take up to 16 additional weeks’ unpaid adoptive leave but you cannot
claim Adoptive Benefit for these extra weeks.
