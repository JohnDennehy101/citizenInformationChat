###  Taxes

There are no specific tax reliefs for children. However, the [ Single Person
Child Carer Credit ](/en/money-and-tax/tax/income-tax-credits-and-
reliefs/single-person-child-carer-tax-credit/) is a tax credit for people who
are caring for children on their own. There is also an [ Incapacitated Child
Tax Credit ](/en/money-and-tax/tax/tax-credits-and-reliefs-for-people-with-
disabilities/incapacitated-child-tax-credit/) if your child is permanently
incapacitated and a [ Home Carer Tax Credit ](/en/money-and-tax/tax/income-
tax-credits-and-reliefs/home-carers-tax-credit/) where one spouse is caring
for a child or dependant person. There are also other [ tax credits and
allowances ](/en/money-and-tax/tax/income-tax-credits-and-
reliefs/introduction-to-income-tax-credits-and-reliefs/) which families can
avail of.
