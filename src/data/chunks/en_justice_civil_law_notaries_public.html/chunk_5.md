###  How do I find a notary public?

A notary may notarise documents in the county where their principal office is
situated and also in some adjoining counties. If the notary you choose will be
required to notarise documents outside their county, you should check they are
authorised to sign and notarise documents in that place. You can find a [ list
of notaries public ](http://www.notarypublic.ie/finding-a-notary/) on the
website of the Faculty of Notaries Public in Ireland (see below).

When meeting a notary you will be required to prove your identity and
residence. You will be required to bring several forms of identification such
as your passport and a recent utility bill.
