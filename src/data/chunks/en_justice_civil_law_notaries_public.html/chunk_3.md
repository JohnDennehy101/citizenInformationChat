###  What do notaries public do?

Notaries certify the execution in their presence of a deed, a contract or
other writing. They can also verify some act or thing done in their presence.
Among the things they do are:

  * Authenticating documents 
  * Witnessing and proving signatures to documents 
  * Administering oaths 
  * Taking affidavits (other than for the courts in Ireland) 
  * Drawing up Powers of Attorney and other legal documents customarily prepared by notaries public
