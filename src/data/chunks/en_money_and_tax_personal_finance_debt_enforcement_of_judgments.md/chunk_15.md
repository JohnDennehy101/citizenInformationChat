##  Attachment of earnings

This is when the money you owe is deducted straight from your wages by direct
debit. The creditor seeks an order from court which is then served on the
debtorâ€™s employer, who sets up a direct debit.

Attachment of earnings is currently only used for [ orders of maintenance of
spouses and children ](/en/birth-family-relationships/separation-and-
divorce/maintenance-orders-and-agreements/) .
