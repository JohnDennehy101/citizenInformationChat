###  Sheriffs and County Registrars

Sheriffs enforce judgments in Cork and Dublin. County Registrars enforce them
in all other places.

Sheriffs are self-employed people who are paid for their enforcement work on a
commission basis. The fees they get are set out in law. Under the law,
sheriffs currently receive various fixed fees and a scale of fees related to
the amount involved in the enforcement. It also covers various expenses the
sheriff has in the enforcement process.

County Registrars are civil servants whose main job is to organise the
business of the Circuit Court in their areas.

As well as County Sheriffs in Cork and Dublin, there are Revenue Sheriffs who
enforce debts owed to Revenue. They have the power to collect tax debts. They
do not need a court order to collect tax debts. Revenue Sheriffs have specific
powers to make an  instalment arrangement with you  . Revenue debts can also
be collected in the normal way if there is a court order.
