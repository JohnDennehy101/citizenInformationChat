##  Execution against goods

Execution against goods means that the creditor gets an order from the court
which directs the Sheriff or County Registrar to seize your goods. The goods
are sold and the money raised used to pay the unpaid debt.

This one of the main ways a creditor can enforce a judgment. It is sometimes
called **distress** against goods. Execution against goods can have different
