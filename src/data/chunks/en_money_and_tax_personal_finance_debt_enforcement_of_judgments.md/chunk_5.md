###  What does registration of the judgment mean?

By registering the judgment, the creditor makes it public that there is a
judgment against you for not paying money you owe. Registering the judgment
does not directly enforce the judgment.

When it is made public, you are unlikely to be able to borrow more money. The
creditor must tell you they plan to register the judgment before they register
it. This gives you a chance to pay the debt.

The creditor can register the court judgment in the Central Office of the High
Court. Credit reference agencies publish lists of judgments that are consulted
by banks (for example, in _Stubbs Gazette_ and some newspapers).
