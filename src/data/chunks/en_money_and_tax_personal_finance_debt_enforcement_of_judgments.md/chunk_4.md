###  What is a stay of execution?

When a court pauses an enforcement for a period of time, it is known as **stay
of execution** .

A stay of execution may be granted, for example, if you can show that it is
not your fault that you are unable to pay.

You cannot get a stay of execution if you have not been engaging with the
court process.
