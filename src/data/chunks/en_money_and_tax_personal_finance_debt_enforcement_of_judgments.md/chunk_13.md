###  **If you do not meet an instalment order**

If you do not meet the instalment order, the creditor may look for a committal
order, which would send you to prison.

You can be imprisoned only if you can afford to pay debts but refuse to do so.

The law that sets out the procedure for committal orders is the [ Enforcement
of Court Orders (Amendment) Act 2009
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2009/act/21/enacted/en/html) .

First, the creditor asks the District Court clerk to issue you a summons to
appear at the District Court for a hearing. The summons must clearly set out:

  * The options available to the judge at the hearing 
  * The consequences if you do not turn up in court, including the possibility that you will be arrested or imprisoned 

Before the hearing, you must:

  * Prepare a statement of means setting out your income and expenditure on a weekly or monthly basis ( [ District Court Form ](https://www.courts.ie/content/forms-civil-proceedings) : 51A.02) 
  * Lodge this statement with the court at least a week before the hearing is due to take place 

At the hearing, both you and the creditor may give evidence. The creditor must
prove beyond reasonable doubt that you have the ability to repay (means), but
you are wilfully refusing to pay.

The court has a number of options:

  * It may change the instalment order. 
  * It may ask you to engage in mediation. The [ Money Advice and Budgeting Service (MABS) ](/en/money-and-tax/personal-finance/debt/mabs-service/) may be used for the mediation. 
  * It may make a committal order (for a maximum of 3 months). A committal order is an order to the Garda√≠ to arrest and imprison you. This can come into effect immediately, or at a later date.
