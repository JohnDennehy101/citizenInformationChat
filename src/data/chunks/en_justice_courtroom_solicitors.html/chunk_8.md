###  2\. Bill of Costs

When the legal services have been provided and it is time for you to pay, your
solicitor must give you a breakdown of all the charges. This is called a Bill
of Costs.

This should contain a summary of the legal services you received, details of
the charges incurred, details on how you can challenge any aspect of the bill,
and other information relating to the case and calculation of costs.

You usually have 30 days to pay the bill, or, if you are not satisfied with
any aspect of the bill, you have 21 days to write to your solicitor and
outline your concerns which they must try to resolve informally with you.
