###  1\. Costs Notice, or Notice of Costs

Your solicitor is required to set out the likely costs of the legal services
to be provided before you agree to proceed further. This is called a Costs
Notice, or a Notice of Costs.

If your solicitor is not able to provide you with the exact costs, they must
still give you a Costs Notice which explains how the costs will be calculated.
They must update you in writing with details of the actual costs as soon as
they become aware of this.
