You can get credits if you are getting [ Illness Benefit
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/social-welfare-
payments/disability-and-illness/disability-benefit/) , [ Injury Benefit
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/social-welfare-
payments/disability-and-illness/injury-benefit/) and [ Invalidity Pension
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/social-welfare-
payments/disability-and-illness/invalidity-pension/) .

If you use up your entitlement to Illness Benefit or Injury Benefit, you
should continue to submit medical certificates to continue to get credits.

If you have applied for Illness Benefit or Injury Benefit and don't qualify
because you do not meet the PRSI requirements, you may still be entitled to
credits if you have paid or credited contributions in the last 2 tax years.
You must submit medical certificates to get credits.

You can continue to get credits during illness if you take part in the [ Back
to Education Allowance Scheme ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-
welfare/social-welfare-payments/back-to-education/back-to-education-
allowance/) .
