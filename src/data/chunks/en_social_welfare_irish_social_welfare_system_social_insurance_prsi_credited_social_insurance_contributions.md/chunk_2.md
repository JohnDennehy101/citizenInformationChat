##  Introduction

If you are working, your employer pays a [ Pay Related Social Insurance (PRSI)
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-
system/social-insurance-prsi/social-insurance/) contribution to the Social
Insurance Fund for you each week. Depending on how much you earn, your
employer may also deduct PRSI from your wages. These PRSI contributions can
help you to qualify for social insurance payments, such as [ Jobseeker's
Benefit ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/social-welfare-
payments/unemployed-people/jobseekers-benefit/) and the [ State Pension
(Contributory) ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/social-
welfare-payments/older-and-retired-people/state-pension-contributory/) .

If you are not working, the Department of Social Protection can give you a
weekly _credited social insurance contribution_ , but you must meet certain
conditions to qualify. Credited contributions can be used with your PRSI
contributions to help you qualify for a [ social insurance payment
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-
system/social-insurance-prsi/social-insurance/) .

PRSI contributions are sometimes called ‘paid contributions’. Credited
contributions are also called 'credits’.

**Record of your contributions**

Your PRSI and credited contributions are recorded on your social insurance
record by the Department of Social Protection. You can request your record of
contributions, known as a ‘Contribution Statement’ on [ MyWelfare.ie
](https://services.mywelfare.ie/en/topics/statements-refunds-and-
repayments/contribution-statement/) .

**Voluntary contributions**

Some people can also choose to pay [ voluntary contributions
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-
system/social-insurance-prsi/voluntary-prsi-contributions/) , which are
different to credited contributions.
