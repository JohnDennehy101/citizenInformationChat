###  Change of status credits

You may qualify for change of status credits, if you are employed at PRSI
Class A and your last paid PRSI contribution was at Class B, C or D. These
change of status credits are only taken into account for the State Pension
(Contributory).

You can get change of status credits back to the beginning of the tax year in
which you start making PRSI contributions at the Class A rate and for the
previous tax year. A mixture of PRSI contributions at Class A and PRSI
contributions at Class B, C or D may help you to qualify for a mixed insurance
pro-rata State Pension (Contributory).
