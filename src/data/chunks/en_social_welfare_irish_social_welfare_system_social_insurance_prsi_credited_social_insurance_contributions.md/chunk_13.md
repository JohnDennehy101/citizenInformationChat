###  Credits for carers

If you give up work to care for someone and get [ Carer's Allowance
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/social-welfare-
payments/carers/carers-allowance/) or [ Carer's Benefit
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/social-welfare-
payments/carers/carers-benefit/) , you will be automatically awarded credits.

If you take unpaid statutory [ carer's leave
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/employment/employment-rights-and-
conditions/leave-and-holidays/carers-leave/) from work and do not get Carer’s
Allowance or Benefit, you can still be awarded credits for up to 104 weeks.
Your employer must complete an [ application for carer's leave 'credits'
](https://www.gov.ie/en/form/46769-application-form-carers-leave-credits/)
when you return to work.

**Carer’s Leave Credits**

People who take Carer’s Leave (temporary unpaid leave from work to care for
someone) but do not get Carer’s Benefit or Carer’s Allowance qualify for
Carer’s Leave credits for each week of Carer’s Leave up to a maximum of 104
weeks. The person should ask their employer to complete the application form
for Carer’s Leave credits on their return to work.
