###  Pre-entry credits when you start work

When you start work you are automatically given _pre-entry credits_ . These
credits are normally given once. They cover you from the beginning of the tax
year in which you start work, up to the actual date you start work. The
credits also cover you for the 2 previous income tax years.

Your pre-entry credits can help you to qualify for the following social
insurance payments:

  * [ Illness Benefit ](/en/social-welfare/disability-and-illness/illness-benefit/)
  * [ Jobseeker's Benefit ](/en/social-welfare/unemployed-people/jobseekers-benefit/)
  * [ Treatment Benefit ](/en/social-welfare/disability-and-illness/treatment-benefit-scheme/)
  * [ Maternity Benefit ](/en/social-welfare/families-and-children/maternity-benefit/)
  * [ Paternity Benefit ](/en/social-welfare/families-and-children/paternity-benefit/)
  * [ Parent's Benefit ](/en/social-welfare/families-and-children/parents-benefit/)
  * [ Adoptive Benefit ](/en/social-welfare/families-and-children/adoptive-benefit/)
  * [ Health and Safety Benefit ](/en/social-welfare/families-and-children/health-safety-benefit/)

Pre-entry credits can also help you qualify for the [ State Pension
(Contributory) ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/social-
welfare-payments/older-and-retired-people/state-pension-contributory/) .
However, the credits will only cover you from the beginning of the tax year in
which you start to work up to the actual date you start work.
