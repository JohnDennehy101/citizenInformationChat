###  Credits and homemakers

The [ Homemaker's Scheme ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-
welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/social-insurance-prsi/homemakers-scheme/)
can make it easier for homemakers to qualify for a State Pension
(Contributory). Under the Scheme, up to 20 years of caring for a [ qualified
child or adult ](https://www.gov.ie/en/service/e216c5-homemakers-scheme/#what-
the-homemakers-scheme-is) can be disregarded when working out your yearly
average contributions for a state pension.

The Scheme only covers complete years. If you are a homemaker for part of a
year either at the start or the end of your homemaking period, you may get
credited contributions.
