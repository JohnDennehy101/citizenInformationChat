###  **General Practitioners (GPs)**

[ General Practitioners (GPs)
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/health/health-services/gp-and-
hospital-services/gps-and-private-patients/) are family doctors.

In Ireland, GPs provide broad services to patients on all health issues and
can refer you to see specialists or hospital consultants if needed. Most GPs
in Ireland are private practitioners, but the majority provide services on
behalf of the HSE.

You can find a GP in your local area using the HSEâ€™s [ Service Finder Map
](https://www2.hse.ie/services/find-a-gp/) .

You do not need a PPS number or other documents to visit a GP.
