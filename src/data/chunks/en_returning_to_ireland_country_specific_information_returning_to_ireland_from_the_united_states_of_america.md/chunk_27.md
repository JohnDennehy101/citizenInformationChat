###  **Private health services**

Either individual health professionals or healthcare companies provide private
healthcare services. Typically, you pay the full cost of private healthcare
services, but you can buy [ private health insurance
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/health/health-system/private-health-
insurance/) to help cover the cost.

Arrangements vary from one company to another, but most private healthcare
companies have agreements with hospitals to pay the hospital directly. In
general, for outpatient costs you pay the health professional and then claim
back from the health insurance company. You should check with your own company
as to their procedures.
