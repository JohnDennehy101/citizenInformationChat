###  The licensing system

If the planning application for a development requires an EIAR to be attached,
then the EIAR must also be included in the application for a licence from the
EPA. The local authority must notify the EPA of any planning application
involving a development which needs an Integrated Pollution Control (IPC)
licence. The EPA then has 5 weeks to comment on the application.

If the local authority decides to give planning permission for such a
development, it cannot impose conditions relating to the control of emissions.
This is for the EPA. It can, however, refuse permission on environmental
grounds (even if the EPA is prepared to grant a licence).
