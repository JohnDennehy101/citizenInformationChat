##  Aggravating and mitigating factors

The judge must consider aggravating and mitigating factors when sentencing
you, unless your offence has a mandatory sentence. Your solicitor or barrister
will urge the judge to consider these factors on your behalf.

  * Aggravating factors may stop the sentence from being reduced 
  * Mitigating factors may lead to the sentence being reduced.
