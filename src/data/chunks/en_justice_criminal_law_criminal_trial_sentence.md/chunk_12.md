###  Co-operation with the Gardaí

Co-operation with the Gardaí also helps you in the sentencing process,
especially if it helped the Gardaí in catching other offenders. For example, [
Section 27 of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1977 (as amended)
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1999/en/act/pub/0010/sec0005.html) provides
that this is taken into account when deciding whether the minimum 10 year
sentence for possession of drugs over a certain value is just and appropriate.
