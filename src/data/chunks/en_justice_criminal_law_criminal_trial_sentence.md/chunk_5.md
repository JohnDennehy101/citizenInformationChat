###  How does a judge decide on a sentence?

The judge goes through 2 steps when considering what sentence to impose on
you:

  1. They decide what the sentence should be, based on the seriousness of the offence. 
  2. They then reduce that sentence, taking into account any mitigating or excusing factors given on your behalf. 

What your [ sentence ](/en/justice/criminal-law/criminal-trial/types-of-
sentences/) will be depends on the offence you committed. Some offences can
only be punished with a fine, meaning there is no option to impose
imprisonment or community service.

There are minimum and maximum sentences for some offences, and the judge must
impose these. For example, for some road traffic offences, the judge must
disqualify offenders from driving for a minimum of two years.

There are mandatory sentences for some offences. For example, if a court finds
you guilty of murder, the judge has to impose a sentence of life imprisonment.

Under the [ Probation of Offenders Act 1907
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1907/act/17/enacted/en/html) , a judge in
the [ District Court ](/en/justice/courts-system/district-court/) may decide
not to convict you, even if it has been proven that you are guilty. The charge
may be dismissed or you may be conditionally discharged. The judge has the
option to do this this if they believe you are unlikely to reoffend.

Public.pdf) which have been set out by the Superior Courts for some offences.
