##  Introduction

The European Union (EU) has a limited role in family law matters. Each
individual member state has its own rules about separation, divorce,
maintenance of spouses and children, custody and guardianship and other family
law matters.

The role of the EU is ensuring that decisions made in one country can be
implemented in another. It also has a role in trying to establish which
country has jurisdiction to hear a particular case. In effect, the EU does not
have rules which govern, for example, who is entitled to have custody or
access but it does have rules which try to make sure that custody and access
orders made in one country can be put into effect in another.
