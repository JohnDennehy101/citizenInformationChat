##  Parental responsibility issues such as custody and access

Any cross-border custody or access orders that were in place at the end of the
transition period remain in effect. So, orders affecting a child with
parents/guardians in both Ireland and the UK are unaffected. If you had an
ongoing case about arrangements for your children at the end of the transition
period, your case will continue under the old rules.

However, if you applied for custody or access after the end of the transition
period, different rules may apply for having the order made or accepted in
Ireland or the UK. In general, cross-border parental responsibility issues
involving Ireland and the UK will be governed by the [ 1996 Hague Protection
of Children Convention
](http://www.hcch.net/index_en.php?act=conventions.text&cid=70) . This is
similar to the system which existed before Brexit and which already applies to
parental responsibility matters with a link to Ireland and to some non-EU
countries such as Australia and Russia.
