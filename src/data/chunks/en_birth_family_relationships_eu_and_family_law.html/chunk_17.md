###  Child abduction

Child abduction is the unlawful removal or retention of a child. If you have
custody of a child and your child is abducted to another member state, you may
apply to that state for the return of the child. The courts of the member
state to which the child has been abducted can only refuse return of the child
in limited circumstances â€“ for example, if there are not adequate safeguards
to ensure that there is no serious risk that return would expose the child to
harm.

In general, the court must order the immediate return of the child. You can
