York Convention)
](http://treaties.un.org/doc/Publication/UNTS/Volume%201268/volume-1268-A-3850-English.pdf)
was brought into effect for Ireland in November 1995 by the [ Maintenance Act
1994 ](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1994/en/act/pub/0028/index.html) . This
Convention is designed to facilitate the recovery of maintenance by a person
living in one jurisdiction against a person living in another. The full list

.

In 2007, the Hague Conference on Private International Law adopted the
following two international instruments which are designed to facilitate the
international recovery of maintenance:

  * [ 2007 Hague Convention ](http://www.hcch.net/index_en.php?act=conventions.text&cid=131) on the international recovery of child support and other forms of family maintenance. It revises two existing Hague Conventions relating to family support as well as the New York Convention. The [ Convention entered into force ](http://www.hcch.net/index_en.php?act=conventions.status&cid=131) on 1 January 2013. 
  * [ 2007 Hague Protocol ](http://www.hcch.net/index_en.php?act=conventions.text&cid=133) on the law applicable to maintenance obligations. The European Union has applied the Protocol since 2011 on a provisional basis to all its member states except for Denmark. The [ Protocol entered into force ](http://www.hcch.net/index_en.php?act=conventions.status&cid=133) on 1 August 2013. 

If you want to enforce a maintenance order in a country not covered by the
Maintenance Regulation or the Lugano Convention, you should contact the
Central Authority for Maintenance Recovery in the [ Department of Justice
](http://www.justice.ie/en/JELR/Pages/Home) for help â€“ see 'Where to apply'
below. The Department is responsible for transmitting and receiving
maintenance.
