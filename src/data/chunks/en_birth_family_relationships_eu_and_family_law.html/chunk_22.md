On 23 June 2016, the United Kingdom (UK) voted to leave the European Union
(EU). Following a [ transition period

on 31 January 2020 at 11pm the UK exited the EU. The UK is no longer a member
of the EU.

[ Brexit ](/en/government-in-ireland/ireland-and-the-uk/what-is-brexit/)
affects a number of family law issues with a cross-border element. So, for
example, there may be changes in how certain aspects of custody and
maintenance applications are processed when one parent lives in the EU and one
parent lives in the UK. The old basis for recognising UK divorces has also
changed although they will still be recognised in Ireland under new rules.
