##  Parental responsibility

[ Regulation 2201/2003 ](http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-
content/EN/TXT/?qid=1422886426094&uri=URISERV:l33194) (also known as "the
Brussels II bis Regulation‚Äù) also sets out the rules on jurisdiction and the
recognition and enforcement of judgments in matters of parental responsibility
for children in cases arising between 1 March 2005 and 31 July 2022.

[ Regulation 2019/1111 ](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-
content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv%3AOJ.L_.2019.178.01.0001.01.ENG&toc=OJ%3AL%3A2019%3A178%3ATOC)
sets out the rules on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of
judgments in matters of parental responsibility for children in cases arising
on or after 1 August 2022.

They apply in a very wide variety of situations. For example:

  * The parents do not need to be married to each other. 
  * The holders of parental responsibility need not be the biological parents of the child in question. 
  * It is not confined to court judgments as it applies to agreements between parents if such agreements are enforceable in the country where they were made.
