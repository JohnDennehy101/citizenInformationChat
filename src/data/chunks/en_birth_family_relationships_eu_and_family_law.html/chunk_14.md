###  Jurisdiction

The general rule is that the court which has jurisdiction in matters of
parental responsibility is the court of the country where the child is
habitually resident. Again, in general, once the matter is before the courts
in one country, that country continues to have jurisdiction even if the child
has recently lawfully changed country of residence. It is possible to have the
case transferred to the new country of residence if certain conditions are met
and if it would be in the best interests of the child.

The parents may agree to have the question of parental responsibility decided
in the court which has jurisdiction on the matrimonial matter (for example,
divorce, annulment or legal separation) or may agree to have the case heard by
the court of a country with which the child has a close connection (for
example, nationality).

If the child's habitual residence cannot be established, then the EU country
in which the child is present has jurisdiction.

In certain circumstances, the court which has jurisdiction may refer the case
to another court if that other court is better placed to hear the case and
this is in the best interests of the child. This could arise, for example, if
the child’s habitual residence has changed. There are time limits on this
procedure. If a child’s habitual residence changes as a result of a wrongful
removal or retention, jurisdiction may move only under very strict conditions.

The Regulation also includes rules on what is to happen if the proceedings are
started in more than one member state.

In urgent cases, a court may take provisional protective measures even if
another member state has jurisdiction on the substantive issue.
