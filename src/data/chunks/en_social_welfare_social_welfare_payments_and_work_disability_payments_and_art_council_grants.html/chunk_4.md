##  Invalidity Pension and the ADC fund

If you are getting an [ Invalidity Pension ](/en/social-welfare/disability-
and-illness/partial-capacity-benefit/) and accept ADC funding, you must
transfer to [ Partial Capacity Benefit (PCB) ](/en/social-welfare/disability-
and-illness/partial-capacity-benefit/) . Your rate of PCB is determined by
your capacity for work. Your rate of PCB is not affected by your ADC funding.
