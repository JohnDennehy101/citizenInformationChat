###  Jobseeker's Allowance, Disability Allowance, and Farm Assist

For [ Jobseeker’s Allowance ](/en/social-welfare/unemployed-people/jobseekers-
allowance/) (JA), [ Disability Allowance ](/en/social-welfare/disability-and-
illness/disability-allowance/) (DA), and [ Farm Assist ](/en/social-
welfare/farming-and-fishing/farm-assist/) (FA), your total household income is
assessed in a [ means test ](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-
system/means-test-for-social-welfare-payments/means-test/) .

Your assessable means are then deducted from the maximum payment for your
circumstances, to find the actual amount of JA, DA or FA you are entitled to.

**Example: Means test for Jobseeker's Allowance**  
---  
Jane is married to John and has 3 children under 12 years of age. If she
applies for Jobseeker’s Allowance, the maximum payment for her circumstances
is €524.  This is made up of:  The personal rate of JA: **€232** An Increase
for a Qualified Adult (IQA): **€154** 3 Increases for a Qualified Child (IQC):
**€46 x 3 = €138** Total: **€524** John does some casual work at weekends, so
the family’s assessable means are €54. These assessable means are deducted
from €524 (€524 - €54 = €470).  **Jane qualifies for a Jobseeker’s Allowance
payment of €470.**
