####  What counts as full-time education?

Your child is considered to be in full-time education if they attend a course
which awards 60 credits per academic year. There are no rules about the number
of ‘class hours’ your child must have. If the institution delivering the
course considers it a full-time course, this means the course has a full-time
workload.

Full-time education does not include any training provided by SOLAS or an
Education and Training Board where:

  * Your child is paid an allowance 
  * Their period of work experience is greater than the period of training or instruction 
  * The training forms part of an employment or work experience programme 

However, [ YouthReach ](/en/education/further-education-and-
training/youthreach/) is the one exception.
