##  How to qualify for an Increase for a Qualified Child

To get an Increase for a Qualified Child (IQC), your child must:

  * Live with you 
  * Meet the age requirement for that payment 
  * Be resident in the State 
  * Not be in [ legal custody ](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/ed7325-operational-guidelines-increase-for-a-qualified-child/#definition-of-a-qualified-child) (detained in a detention school) 

Your child does not have to be financially dependent on you. Your child can
work and earn money, without affecting the increase paid to you. An IQC can be
paid on behalf of [ foster children ](/en/birth-family-relationships/adoption-
and-fostering/fostering/) .

However, you generally do not get an IQC if your child is getting their own
social welfare payment, except in certain circumstances (see ‘If your child is
getting a social welfare payment’ below).
