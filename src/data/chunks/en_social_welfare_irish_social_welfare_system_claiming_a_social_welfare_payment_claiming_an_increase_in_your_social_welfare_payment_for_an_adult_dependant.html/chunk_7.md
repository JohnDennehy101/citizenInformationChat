####  Social insurance payments

For most social insurance payments your adult dependant cannot have gross
weekly earnings or [ income
](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/195986-operational-guidelines-increase-
for-a-qualified-adult/) (before tax and PRSI deductions) of more than €310. If
your adult dependant earns less than €100 you will get a full Increase for a
Qualified Adult (IQA). If your adult dependant earns between €100 and €310 you
will get a reduced rate of IQA (sometimes called a tapered rate of IQA). If
your adult dependant is earning more than €310 you will not get an IQA. You
can find out what the tapered rate of IQA for your payment is in the
Department of Social Protection's [ SW19 (Rates of Payment) booklet
](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/6aec4d-current-rates-of-payment-for-
social-welfare-payments-sw19/) .
