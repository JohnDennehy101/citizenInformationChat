##  Introduction

If you qualify for a social welfare payment you get an amount for yourself,
which is called the 'personal rate of payment'.

You may also get an extra amount for your adult dependant (called a qualified
adult) which is paid as an increase to your personal payment (called an
Increase for a Qualified Adult or IQA). An adult dependant is usually your
spouse, civil partner or cohabitant. A [ cohabitant
](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/d258d8-cohabitation/) is one of two adults
(whether of the same or opposite sex) who live together as a couple in an
intimate and committed relationship and who are not close relatives.

To get an IQA your spouse, civil partner or cohabitant must meet the
conditions set by the Department of Social Protection - see 'Rules' below. The
person does not have to be totally dependent on you (for example, they may be
working and earning or have income from other sources) but any income they
have must be below a certain level - see 'Income limits' below.

If you have dependent children you may also get an [ Increase for a Qualified
Child (IQC) ](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/claiming-a-

dependant/) .
