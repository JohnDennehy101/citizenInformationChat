###  Who is an adult dependent?

**Only one IQA for an adult dependent can be paid with your social welfare
payment.**

An adult dependent is a spouse, civil partner or cohabitant that you are [
wholly or mainly financially supporting
](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/195986-operational-guidelines-increase-
for-a-qualified-adult/#payment-of-an-increase-for-a-qualified-adult-iqa) . If
you are divorced or separated from your spouse or civil partner, you may
continue to get an IQA, if you are wholly or mainly financially supporting
them.

A person over 16 years of age who lives with you and you are [ wholly or
mainly maintaining ](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/195986-operational-
guidelines-increase-for-a-qualified-adult/#payment-of-an-increase-for-a-
qualified-adult-iqa) can be considered an adult dependent, if they are caring
for a child that you are getting an IQC for.

You will not get an IQA if your spouse, partner or cohabitant is not

welfare payment in their own right, except for:
