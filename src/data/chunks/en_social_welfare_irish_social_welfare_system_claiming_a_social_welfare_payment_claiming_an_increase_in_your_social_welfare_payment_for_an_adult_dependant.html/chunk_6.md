####  Social assistance payments

If you are getting a [ social assistance (means-tested) payment ](/en/social-
welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/social-assistance-payments/social-
assistance-in-ireland/) , your adult dependant's income is assessed in the
means test for your payment. In the case of [ Jobseeker's Allowance (JA)
](/en/social-welfare/unemployed-people/jobseekers-allowance/) , [ Disability
Allowance (DA) ](/en/social-welfare/disability-and-illness/disability-
allowance/) and [ Farm Assist (FA) ](/en/social-welfare/farming-and-
fishing/farm-assist/) your household income is assessed in the [ means test
](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/means-test-for-social-
welfare-payments/means-test/) . Your total household means are then deducted
from the maximum payment (this is the personal rate including any increases
for adult and child dependants) to find the actual amount of JA, DA or FA you
are entitled to.
