###  Other consequences of civil partnership

**Civil liability:** A surviving civil partner may sue for the wrongful death
of their civil partner, where the death was caused by the negligence or
wrongdoing of another person and has resulted in injury or mental distress to
the survivor.

**Mental health:** A civil partner may apply for the involuntary admission to
a psychiatric institution of a mentally ill civil partner (provided the
parties are not separated and provided the applicant has not been the subject
of an application under the Domestic Violence Acts).

**Power of attorney:** A civil partner must be informed of the registration of
an enduring power of attorney. Similarly, an enduring power of attorney in
favour of a civil partner is no longer valid if the partnership is dissolved
or there is a safety or barring order against the civil partner.

**Property disputes:** A civil partner may apply to the courts for a decision
in relation to disputes over property with their partner.

**Tenancies:** Under the Residential Tenancies Act 2004, a civil partner may
be able to take over a tenancy on the death of their partner.

**Former spouses who entered into civil partnerships:** If you were married to
someone and the marriage ended, and then you entered into a civil partnership
with someone else, you lose your status as a former spouse. Under divorce
legislation, former spouses continue to have the right to go to the courts for
maintenance and property orders. However, once a former spouse entered into a
civil partnership, this changed. Maintenance orders and pension adjustment
orders in favour of a former spouse lapsed if that spouse entered into a civil
partnership. A property adjustment order may not be made for the benefit of a
former spouse if that spouse has entered into a registered civil partnership.
