##  Introduction

A statutory civil partnership registration scheme for same-sex couples was
introduced in January 2011 under the [ Civil Partnership and Certain Rights
and Obligations of Cohabitants Act 2010
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2010/en/act/pub/0024/index.html) . The Act
sets out the rights and obligations that civil partners have towards each
other. These are broadly the same as the rights and obligations of married
couples towards each other. The Act did not change the law on issues relating
to children, for example, guardianship, adoption, custody, access or
maintenance.

Civil partners are treated in the same way as married couples under the tax
and social welfare codes. Revenue has details of the [ tax treatment and
assessment of married couples and civil partners
](https://www.revenue.ie/en/life-events-and-personal-circumstances/marital-
status/marriage-and-civil-partnerships/index.aspx) on its website.

Civil partnerships which were registered in other countries and which met
certain criteria were also recognised in Ireland.
