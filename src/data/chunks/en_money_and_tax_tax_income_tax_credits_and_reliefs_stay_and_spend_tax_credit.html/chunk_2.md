##  Introduction

The Stay and Spend Tax Credit Scheme allows you to claim a certain amount of
tax back on accommodation, food and non-alcoholic drink bought between 1
October 2020 and 30 April 2021. This spending is known as _qualifying
expenditure_ .

Under the scheme:

  * A transaction must be at least €25 
  * You can submit receipts up to a total of €625, or €1,250 for a jointly-assessed married couple 
  * The maximum tax credit you can get is €125, or up to €250 for a jointly-assessed married couple 

All claims must be made within 4 years from the end of the tax year in which
you made the qualifying expenditure. For money spent between 1 October 2020
and 31 December 2020, you must claim the tax credit by 31 December 2024.
