##  Who is entitled to claim?

Any taxpayer who spends at least €25 in a single transaction on ‘qualifying
expenditure’ between 1 October 2020 and 30 April 2021 is eligible to claim the
Stay and Spend Tax Credit.

You do not need to have been on a ‘staycation’ to avail of the scheme. You can
claim for expenses you paid in your local area if they qualify.
