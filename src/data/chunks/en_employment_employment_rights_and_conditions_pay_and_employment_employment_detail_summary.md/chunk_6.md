##  What happens if my employer doesnâ€™t pay tax or PRSI contributions?

By law, your employer must:

  * [ Register all employees for PRSI ](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/social-insurance-prsi/paying-social-insurance/)
  * Pay the correct contributions 
  * Keep accurate records for all employees 
  * Produce these records when requested by a social welfare inspector 

An employer who fails to do any of the above can be subject to penalties,
prosecution or both. These rules are set out in the Social Welfare
(Consolidation) Act 1993.

If your employer does not deduct tax from your pay, you should speak with them
first. If this continues, you should contact [ Revenue
](https://www.revenue.ie/en/contact-us/index.aspx) .
