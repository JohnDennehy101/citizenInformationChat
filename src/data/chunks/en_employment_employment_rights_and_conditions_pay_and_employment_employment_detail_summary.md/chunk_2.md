##  What is my Employment Detail Summary?

As part of PAYE modernisation, paper-based P45s and P60s were replaced with an
online system.

You no longer get a P60 at the end of the year. Instead, you can get an
_Employment Detail Summary_ through [ Revenueâ€™s myAccount service
](https://www.ros.ie/myaccount-web/sign_in.html?execution=e1s1) .

An Employment Detail Summary contains details of your pay as well as the
income [ tax ](/en/money-and-tax/tax/income-tax/how-your-tax-is-calculated/) ,
[ PRSI ](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/social-insurance-
prsi/paying-social-insurance/) and [ Universal Social Charge (USC)
](/en/money-and-tax/tax/income-tax/universal-social-charge/) that has been
deducted by your employer and paid to Revenue.

Your Employment Detail Summary also records your [ Local Property Tax (LPT)
](/en/money-and-tax/tax/housing-taxes-and-reliefs/local-property-tax/)
deductions, if you choose to have the LPT deducted from your pay.

It is important to remember that the Employment Detail Summary is not a
statement of the tax you actually paid. It summarises deductions paid to
Revenue by your employer or pension provider. You may have other tax
liabilities that are not listed.

Your employer does not include non-statutory deductions, such as union
subscriptions or payments to your credit union in the report to Revenue.
Therefore, you cannot view these deductions on your Employment Detail Summary
in [ myAccount ](https://www.ros.ie/myaccount-web/sign_in.html?execution=e1s1)
.
