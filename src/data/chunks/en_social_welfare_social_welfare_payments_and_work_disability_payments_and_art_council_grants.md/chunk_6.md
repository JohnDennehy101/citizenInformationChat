####  **How ADC funding is assessed**

The total amount of ADC funding that you are awarded is divided by the number
of weeks in the award period to give a weekly amount.

This weekly amount is then assessed as income from self-employment, as
follows:

  * The first €165 of funding is disregarded (not counted) 
  * 50% of funding between €166 and €375 is assessed 
  * Funding over €375 is assessed in full
