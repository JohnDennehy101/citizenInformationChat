##  Disability Allowance, Blind Pension and the ADC fund

ADC funding is assessed as self-employment income in the means test for
Disability Allowance (DA) and Blind Pension (BP). The means test examines all
your sources of income to find out if you qualify for DA or BP.

[ Allowable work-related expenses
](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/11f23e-means-assessment-guidelines/#cash-
income) can be deducted from the ADC grant when your means are assessed.

If your ADC funding stops within 12 months, you can return to your Disability
Allowance or Blind Pension payment. Your means may be reassessed.
