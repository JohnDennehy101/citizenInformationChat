####  Example for Blind Pension

I am getting a weekly Blind Pension of €220. I was awarded Arts and Disability
Connect funding of €15,000 over 12 months. How will my Blind Pension be
affected?

  * Blind Pension is €220 per week 
  * ADC funding is €288.46 per week 
  * The first €165 is not counted in the means test (€288.46 - 165 = €123.46) 
  * 50% of funding between €166 and €375 is assessed (€123.46/2 = €61.73) 
  * Means of €61.73 will give you a new Blind Pension of €165 per week, see [ SW19 ](https://www.gov.ie/en/collection/1af6ca-rates-of-payment-sw19/) for how means affects BP 

Your new income is €453.46 per week. This includes your Blind Pension of €165
and ADC funding of €288.46 per week.
