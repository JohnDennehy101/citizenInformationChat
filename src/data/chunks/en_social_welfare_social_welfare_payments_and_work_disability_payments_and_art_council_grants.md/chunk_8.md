####  Example for Disability Allowance

I am getting a weekly Disability Allowance of €220. I was awarded Arts and
Disability Connect funding of €15,000 over 12 months. Will my Disability
Allowance be affected?

  * Disability Allowance is €220 per week 
  * ADC funding is €288.46 per week 
  * The first €165 is not counted in the means test (€288.46 - 165 = €123.46) 
  * 50% of earnings between €166 and €375 is assessed (€123.46/2 = €61.73) 
  * Means of €61.73 will give you a new Disability Allowance of €165 per week, see [ SW19 ](https://www.gov.ie/en/collection/1af6ca-rates-of-payment-sw19/) for how means affects Disability Allowance 

Your new income is €453.46 per week. This includes Disability Allowance of
€165 and ADC funding of €288.46 per week.
