##  Applying to vote from home

If you live at home and you have a disability or illness that prevents you
from going to a polling station, you may qualify to vote by post. You must
apply to your local authority to be included in the Postal Voters List.

If you are living in a hospital, nursing home or similar institution and you
have a disability or illness that prevents you from going to the polling
station, you can vote at the hospital or nursing home. You must apply to your
local authority to be included in the Special Voters List.

If you are on the current year's Postal or Special Voters List, you will
generally get an application form in the post. If not, you can download one
from [ checktheregister.ie ](https://www.checktheregister.ie/en-IE/forms) .
Forms are also available from all [ local authorities
](http://www.housing.gov.ie/local-government/administration/local-
authorities/local-authorities) , post offices, Garda stations and public
libraries. The application form includes provision for a medical certificate,
which is usually only needed for your first application.

Applications to be included in the register must be sent to your local
authority. The local authority must receive your application by the following
dates, at the latest:

  * For a general election, 2 days after the date of dissolution of the Dáil 
  * For a Dáil by-election, 2 days after the date of the order appointing polling day 
  * For other elections or for referendums, 22 days (excluding Sundays and public holidays) before polling day
