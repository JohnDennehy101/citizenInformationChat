##  How to vote from a hospital or nursing home

Shortly before polling day, you will be notified of the day and approximate
time when a special presiding officer will call to you at the hospital or
nursing home to allow you to vote.

This official will show you evidence of their identity and an appointment
warrant when they arrive. They will be accompanied by a Garda, whose role is
to guard the ballot papers (in the same way as in a polling station) and to
act as an independent witness to guarantee that the voting procedure is
carried out properly.

Only the presiding officer and the Garda can be present when you cast your
vote. The presiding officer will give you a declaration of identity, which
they will witness for you. You then mark the ballot paper in secret, place it
in the special envelope provided, close the envelope and present it to the
presiding officer.

If you need help with voting, the special presiding officer will provide it in
the same way as at a polling station.
