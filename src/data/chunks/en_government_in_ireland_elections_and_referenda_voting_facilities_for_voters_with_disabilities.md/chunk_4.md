###  Voting at an alternative polling station

The returning officer will give public notice of all the polling stations in
the constituency that are not accessible to wheelchair users. If you have
difficulty gaining access to your local polling station, you can apply in
writing to the returning officer at least a week before polling day for
permission to vote at another polling station in the same constituency.

In Dublin and Cork, the returning officer is the city or county sheriff. In
other counties, it is the county registrar.

To help the returning officer pick a suitable alternative station you should
explain in your application why you cannot access your local station. If
possible, you should suggest another polling station that is both accessible
and convenient for you.

The returning officer will send you written authorisation to vote at another
polling station, usually the one that you have suggested. You should present
this authorisation (along with the usual evidence of identity) when you go to
vote. Once you have been assigned another polling station, you cannot vote at
your local station.
