###  Assistance with voting at a polling station

The presiding officer is the person who is responsible for taking the poll at
a polling station. A supervising presiding officer may also be on duty â€“ their
responsibilities include supervising the arrangements for voters with
disabilities. You can ask to see the supervising presiding officer if you need
assistance.

There are strict rules to ensure that the secrecy and security of the ballot
are maintained. The law is specific about the types of voters who can be
helped to vote, how they may be helped, and who may help them. The presiding
officer has to apply the law, which is intended to make sure that you can vote
the way you want to and that your vote is kept secret.

Depending on the nature of your disability, you may be helped to vote in 3
ways:

  * Companion voting 
  * Assistance from the presiding officer 
  * Using a ballot paper template
