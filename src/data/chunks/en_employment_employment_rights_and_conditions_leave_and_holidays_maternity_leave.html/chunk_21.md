###  **Can I postpone maternity leave if my baby goes into hospital?**

You may be able to postpone, or delay, maternity leave if your baby goes into
hospital (but not if they are simply unwell).

You should apply to your employer if you want to postpone maternity leave (or
additional maternity leave) and go back to work while your baby is in
hospital. Your employer has the right to refuse.

Fathers who are on maternity leave cannot postpone it.

To request that your maternity leave is postponed, you must have taken at
least 14 weeksâ€™ maternity leave, including 4 weeks after the birth. You can go
back to work and postpone your maternity leave for up to 6 months.

If you postpone your maternity leave and return to work until the baby comes
out of hospital, then you may take your remaining leave in one block. It must
start within 7 days of the baby being discharged from hospital. Your employer
may ask the hospital to confirm in writing that the baby has gone into
hospital and then to confirm the date of discharge.

If you postpone your maternity leave and go back to work, you must write to
tell the DSP, who will suspend your Maternity Benefit. When the baby is
discharged, your GP or hospital doctor must write to tell the DSP. You should
then start getting Maternity Benefit again. All documents you send to the DSP
must show your [ Personal Public Service number ](/en/social-welfare/irish-
social-welfare-system/personal-public-service-number/) (PPS number).
