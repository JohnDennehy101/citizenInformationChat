###  **Can I return to my old job after maternity leave?**

You are treated as being in employment while you are on maternity leave and
additional maternity leave. This means that you have the right to return to
work to the same job with the same contract of employment. If this is too
difficult to arrange, your employer must provide suitable alternative work on
terms that are not ‘less favourable’ than in your previous job.

If pay or other conditions have improved while you have been on maternity
leave, then you should get the improvements when you return to work.

If you decide not to return to work after your period of maternity leave, you
must give your employer notice in the usual way, as set out in your contract.
