###  **Your employer**

In general, employers do not have to pay women who are on maternity leave.

You should check your contract of employment to see whether you are entitled
to pay and pension contributions from your employer during your maternity
leave.

Your contract could give you the right to pay from your employer in addition
to Maternity Benefit while you are on maternity leave. For example, your
employer may top up the amount you get from Maternity Benefit to match your
normal pay.
