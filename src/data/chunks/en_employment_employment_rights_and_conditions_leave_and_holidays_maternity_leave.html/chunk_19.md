###  **What happens if I get sick while on maternity leave or additional
maternity leave?**

If you get sick while on maternity leave, you cannot postpone your maternity
leave and take it after your sick leave ends. Maternity leave must be taken in
one continuous block.

Your leave from work due to sickness is treated in the same way as any other [
sick leave ](/en/employment/employment-rights-and-conditions/leave-and-
holidays/sick-leave-and-sick-pay/) from work but you are not entitled to take
the rest of your maternity leave after your sick leave ends.

If you become ill while you are on additional maternity leave, you may ask
your employer if you can end the additional maternity leave. If they agree,
they will treat you as being on [ sick leave ](/en/employment/employment-
rights-and-conditions/leave-and-holidays/sick-leave-and-sick-pay/) . You may
then qualify for [ Illness Benefit ](/en/social-welfare/disability-and-
illness/illness-benefit/) . However, you cannot take the rest of your
additional maternity leave later – see ‘More information on postponing
maternity leave’ below.
