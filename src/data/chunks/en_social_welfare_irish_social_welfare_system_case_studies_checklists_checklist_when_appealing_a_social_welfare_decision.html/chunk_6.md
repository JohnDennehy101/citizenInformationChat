####  **Do you need help with making your appeal?**

Some voluntary organisations (such as [ your local Citizens Information Centre
](http://centres.citizensinformation.ie/) ) can help you to decide if you have
grounds for an appeal. They can help you to prepare your case and may even go
with you on the day of your oral hearing.
