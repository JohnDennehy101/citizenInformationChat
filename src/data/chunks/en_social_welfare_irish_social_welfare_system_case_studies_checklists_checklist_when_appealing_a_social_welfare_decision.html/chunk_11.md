####  **Has the Social Welfare Appeals Office confirmed they got your
appeal?**

You should get a letter from the Social Welfare Appeals Office telling you
they have received your appeal. It will contain your Appeal Reference Number.

You should put your Appeal Reference Number on all written communication with
the Social Welfare Appeals Office. You should also have it to hand if you
phone them.
