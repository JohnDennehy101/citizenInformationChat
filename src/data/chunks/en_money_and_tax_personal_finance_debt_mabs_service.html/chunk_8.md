###  Code of conduct on mortgage arrears

The Central Bank has a [ Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/housing/owning-a-home/mortgage-
arrears/consumer-protection-codes-and-mortgages/) which sets out what your
lender must do. Mortgage lenders must follow a process called the [ Mortgage
Arrears Resolution Process (MARP) ](/en/housing/owning-a-home/mortgage-
arrears/mortgage-arrears-resolution-process/) . The lender must refer you to
sources of information and advice, such as MABS.

As part of the MARP, you must fill out a [ standard financial statement (pdf)
](https://www.centralbank.ie/docs/default-source/Regulation/consumer-
protection/other-codes-of-conduct/36-gns-4-2-7-financial-statement.pdf) for
your lender, so that they can assess your financial position and work out the
best solution. MABS can help you to complete this statement. The Central Bank
has published [ A Consumer Guide to Completing a Standard Financial Statement
(pdf) ](https://www.centralbank.ie/docs/default-source/Regulation/consumer-
protection/other-codes-of-conduct/35-gns-4-2-7-mortgage-arrears---
