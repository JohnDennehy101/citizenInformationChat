##  What help can I get?

If you leave Ireland voluntarily, you may get financial help, if you need it.

You can get help with the cost of your:

  * Travel to the airport 
  * Flights 
  * Transit visas and food costs 
  * Medical appointments, medication and travel documentation 

You may also get a ‘reintegration grant’ to help you to settle back home.
