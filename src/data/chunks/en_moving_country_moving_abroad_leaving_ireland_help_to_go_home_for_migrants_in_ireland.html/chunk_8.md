###  What is the reintegration grant?

The reintegration grant is available to some people who apply to voluntarily
return to their country of origin. For example, the grant can help you to
access education or set up a small business when you return to your home
country.

The reintegration grant provides:

  * €1200 for one person 
  * €2000 for a couple or family 

You can discuss your needs with the Voluntary Return Unit to find out what
financial support you can get.
