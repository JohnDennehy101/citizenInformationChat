##  Leaving Ireland without help

If you leave Ireland without the help of the voluntary returns programme, you
must tell the [ Voluntary Returns Unit of the Department of Justice
](https://www.irishimmigration.ie/my-situation-has-changed-since-i-arrived-in-
ireland/voluntary-returns/#who-do-I-contact) so they can close your case and
stop you getting a deportation order.

You can get a deportation order even if you have left Ireland. If you donâ€™t
tell the Department that you have left Ireland, your case will stay open, and
you will be issued with a deportation order.
