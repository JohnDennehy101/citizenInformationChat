##  Can I get help from the voluntary return programme?

You can use the voluntary return programme, if any of the following apply to
you.

  * You are in Ireland illegally 
  * You have withdrawn your application for international protection 
  * You have been refused [ international protection ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/moving-country/asylum-seekers-and-refugees/the-asylum-process-in-ireland/if-your-application-for-refugee-status-is-refused/)
  * You have been notified that you will get a deportation order 
  * You are victim of trafficking in Ireland 

You cannot use the voluntary return scheme, if you have already received a
deportation order.
