##  Introduction

If you and your spouse separate, it may change the way you are taxed. The
information here also applies to civil partners who separate.

This page explains how income tax is affected. You can also read about [
capital taxes following separation or divorce ](/en/money-and-tax/tax/capital-
taxes/capital-taxes-following-separation-or-divorce/) .

When a couple separate, they may agree that payments will be made to support a
child or former partner. [ Read about how maintenance payments are taxed
](/en/money-and-tax/tax/income-tax-credits-and-reliefs/maintenance-and-tax/) .

If you are separated and have a legal agreement for maintenance payments, [
you can choose to continue to be treated as a married couple for tax purposes
](https://www.revenue.ie/en/life-events-and-personal-circumstances/marital-
status/separation-divorce-and-civil-annulment/electing-for-married-or-civil-
partnership-treatment.aspx) .

If you have a child that lives with you for most of the year, you may be
eligible for the [ Single Parent Child Carer Credit ](/en/money-and-
tax/tax/income-tax-credits-and-reliefs/single-person-child-carer-tax-credit/)
