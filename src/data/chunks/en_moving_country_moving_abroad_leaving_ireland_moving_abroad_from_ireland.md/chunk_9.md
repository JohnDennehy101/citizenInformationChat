##  Settling in

When you arrive at your destination, you may find that a lot of the attitudes
and practices that you take for granted and consider "normal" are in fact
peculiar to Irish culture. It can take time to settle into a new way of life,
so give yourself time to adjust.

There are Irish organisations, sports and community groups around the world
who can help you to stay connected with Ireland and help you to meet Irish
people abroad. DFAâ€™s [ Global Irish Directory
](https://www.ireland.ie/en/irish-diaspora/) lists over 1,000 Irish groups
around the world.
