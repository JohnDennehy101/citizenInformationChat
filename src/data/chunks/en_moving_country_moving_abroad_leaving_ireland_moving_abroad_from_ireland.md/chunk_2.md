Whether you are planning to spend time travelling abroad or are moving to
another country to work, start by reading up to date [ travel advice
](https://www.ireland.ie/en/dfa/overseas-travel/advice/) from the Department
of Foreign Affairs (DFA). This includes information on things you should [
know before you go ](https://www.ireland.ie/en/dfa/overseas-travel/know-
before-you-go/) such as:

  * [ Travel insurance ](https://www.ireland.ie/en/dfa/overseas-travel/know-before-you-go/travel-insurance-and-health/)
  * [ Passports and visa requirements ](https://www.dfa.ie/travel/know-before-you-go/passport-and-visas/)

You can also read our [ general tips for travelling abroad ](/en/travel-and-
recreation/travel-abroad/travelling-abroad-during-covid/) for more on what you
need to do before you leave. For example, you should [ apply for an Irish
passport ](/en/travel-and-recreation/passports/applying-for-or-renewing-an-

If possible speak to people you may know who are living in or have previously
lived in the country you are moving to and find out about what life is like
there. Crosscare Irish Diaspora Support Project has more useful tips on what
