###  What should I do if I get a CPO?

The compulsory purchase system is a complex area. You should get professional
advice from a chartered surveyor if you are served with a notice about a CPO.
The fees charged by a chartered surveyor are part of a normal claim for
compensation.

You can find a chartered surveyor on the website of the [ Society of Chartered
Surveyors Ireland (SCSI) ](http://www.scsi.ie/) . The SCSI is the professional
body for chartered surveyors.

If you get a CPO, you have the right to:

  * Object to it 
  * Make representations 
  * Negotiate 
  * Refer the matter to property arbitrators 
  * Have your objections heard
