##  Buying from a garage or car dealer

When you buy a used car from a trader, you have a number of rights under
consumer law. Garages and car dealers must treat you fairly, whether they are
selling from a business premises or online. They must make sure the car is
safe and must give you enough information to make a decision based on facts.
You can read more about [ your consumer rights ](/en/consumer/consumer-
laws/your-consumer-rights/) .

Find out if the trader has a good reputation by asking other people or by
checking online reviews. You can check if the trader is a member of an
association such as the [ Society of the Irish Motor Industry (SIMI)
](https://www.simi.ie/en) . Members must follow the SIMI code of ethics. This
includes doing checks on second-hand vehicles and sorting out any issues that
arise. You can check the online list of [ SIMI members
](https://www.simi.ie/en/find-a-member) .

Before you buy from a garage or a car dealer, you should:

  * Ask about the history of the car and the number of previous owners. Many dealers will provide a report on this. 
  * Ask if a written [ warranty (or guarantee) ](/en/consumer/shopping/guarantees-and-warranties/) is available. 
  * Check the car for wear and tear. For example, check the tyres, wheel arches, oil, seatbelts, lights and wipers. The trader should point out any defects or problems to you before you buy. 
  * Get the necessary documents. You should ask for a National Car Test (NCT) Certificate (if the car is over 4 years old) and a Vehicle Registration Tax (VRT) Certificate (if the car is imported). Ask for the car’s service book and the handbook or manual. 
  * Check the odometer reading (the measure of distance travelled). Previous odometer readings are printed on the NCT certificate and the most recent NCT reading is shown on the NCT disc. Compare this with the reading that is currently on the car’s dashboard odometer. If the distance shown on the disc is higher than the one on the odometer, it may mean the odometer has been altered (clocked). The Road Safety Authority has more information on [ odometer readings and verification ](https://www.rsa.ie/RSA/Your-Vehicle/Your-Vehicle-/Odometer-Readings/) . 
  * Ask for two sets of keys for the car and a signed receipt for payment.
