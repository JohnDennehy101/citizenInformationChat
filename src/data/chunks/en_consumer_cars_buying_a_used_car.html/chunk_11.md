####  You are selling or trading in your old car

If you are selling or if you are trading your old car in for a new car, both
you and the dealer will have to complete the RF200 form, the Vehicle
Registration Certificate or the Vehicle Licencing Certificate. You will both
also have to complete an [ RF105 form ](https://www.gov.ie/en/form/0209fd-
transfer-of-vehicle-ownership-to-a-motor-dealer-since-111993-form/) , which is
a form to transfer the ownership of your old car to a dealer.

The seller must make sure that necessary documentation relating to the change
of ownership is fully completed and signed by both parties.

The way it is done depends on when the car was first registered:

  * Vehicles first registered after 1 January 1993: the change of ownership can be registered at either your local motor tax office or with the Vehicle Registration Unit at the [ Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport ](https://www.gov.ie/en/policy-information/1ba443-motor-taxvehicle-registration/?referrer=/roads/english/motor-taxvehicle-registraton-nvdf/)
  * Vehicles first registered on or before 1 January 1993: the change of ownership must be registered at your local motor tax office
