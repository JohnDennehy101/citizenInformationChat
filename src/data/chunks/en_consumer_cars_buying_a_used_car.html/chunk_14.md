###  NCT certificate

All cars in Ireland must reach a certain standard of safety and must be
roadworthy. Vehicles over 4 years old must be tested at an NCTS centre to show
they meet the safety standards. If a car is between 4 and 9 years old, it must
be tested at an NCTS centre every 2 years. When the car is 10 years old or
older, it must be tested once a year.

When you buy a used car over 4 years old, make sure that it has passed the NCT
test and has a valid certificate to prove it. You can find out more about the
[ NCT test ](/en/travel-and-recreation/vehicle-standards/national-car-test/) .
