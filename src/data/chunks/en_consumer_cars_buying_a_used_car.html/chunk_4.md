##  Buying at a car auction

If you buy at an auction you don’t have the same rights if the car is ‘sold as
seen’. You cannot hold the auctioneer responsible for any faults you find in
the car after you bought it. By bidding at the auction, you agree to the
auctioneer’s conditions of sale.

If the car is ‘sold as seen’ it is up to you to do the necessary checks by
inspecting the car before bidding. It may be a good idea to get a mechanic to
examine the car before you make a bid. Used cars bought at an auction,
generally do not come with warranty (or guarantee) unless the car
manufacturer’s warranty is still valid.
