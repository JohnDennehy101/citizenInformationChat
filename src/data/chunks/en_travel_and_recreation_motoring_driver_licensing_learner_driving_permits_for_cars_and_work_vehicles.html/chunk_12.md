###  **Essential Driver Training**

All holders of their first learner permit issued from 4 April 2011 must
undertake Essential Driver Training (EDT) with an RSA Approved Driving
Instructor (ADI). You can access [ details of ADIs
](http://www.rsa.ie/en/RSA/Learner-Drivers/Finding-an-instructor/Find-an-
instructor/) located across the country.

EDT is a training course that teaches fundamental driving skills to learner
car drivers. The RSA has published [ detailed guidance (pdf) on EDT
](https://www.rsa.ie/docs/default-source/services/s1.2-get-
qualified/essential-driver-training-a5-mar19-v4.pdf?sfvrsn=4f5a68f2_5) . The
course is made up of 12 individual 1 hour sessions.

At each EDT session, your ADI will check your learner permit and record the
session with a stamp and signature in your official EDT logbook. You will be
required to produce your completed [ EDT logbook
](https://www.rsa.ie/docs/default-source/services/s1.2-get-qualified/edt-
learner-logbook.pdf?sfvrsn=210f2346_5) on the day of the driving test.

You can also [ nominate a sponsor ](https://www.rsa.ie/services/learner-
drivers/driving-lessons/car-driving-lessons-\(edt\)) to accompany you during
your EDT sessions. Typically a family member or close friend, your sponsor
should be an experienced licence-holder who can support you in preparing for
your test.

If you have a full driving licence from a country that does not have a [
licence exchange agreement with Ireland ](/en/travel-and-
recreation/motoring/driver-licensing/exchanging-foreign-driving-permit/) , you
will only be required to complete 6 EDT sessions before taking the Irish
driving test. The RSA have published a [ detailed handbook on Reduced EDT
(pdf)
