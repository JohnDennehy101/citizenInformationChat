##  Irish citizenship through adoption

Under the [ Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1956/en/act/pub/0026/sec0011.html#sec11) , if
a child who is not an Irish citizen is [ adopted ](/en/birth-family-
relationships/adoption-and-fostering/domestic-adoption/) by an Irish citizen
or a couple where either spouse is an Irish citizen, then the adopted child
shall be an Irish citizen.

If an Irish citizen who is living abroad adopts a child abroad, they should
apply for the adoption to be entered in the [ Register of Intercountry
Adoptions ](https://aai.gov.ie/en/who-we-are/inter-country/rica.html) . Once
it is registered, the adoption has the same legal status as if the adoption
was made in the State.

If an Irish citizen living in the State is in the process of having a foreign
adoption recognised here, certain [ immigration procedures must be observed
](https://www.irishimmigration.ie/my-situation-has-changed-since-i-arrived-in-
ireland/foreign-adoption-immigration-clearance-letter/) . In order for the
adopted child to enter the State, you must get immigration clearance in
advance from the Department of Justice. This clearance will only be granted
once the adoptive parent(s) proposing to adopt abroad have successfully
completed the assessment procedure and have had a declaration made in their
favour by the [ Adoption Authority of Ireland ](http://www.aai.gov.ie/) . This
is called an [ intercountry adoption ](/en/birth-family-
relationships/adoption-and-fostering/intercountry-adoption/) .
