###  2\. Born in Ireland after 31 December 2004

The people of Ireland voted to change the constitutional right to citizenship
in the [ 27th Amendment to the Irish Constitution
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2004/ca/27/enacted/en/html) . This ended
the automatic entitlement to citizenship by birth to everyone born in Ireland.

If you are born on or after 1 January 2005, your entitlement to Irish
citizenship depends on the nationality or residence history of your parent or
parents.
