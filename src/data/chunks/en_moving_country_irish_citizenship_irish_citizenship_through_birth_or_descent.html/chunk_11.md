###  Irish citizen parent born outside Ireland

If you were born outside of Ireland and your parent (who was also born outside
of Ireland) was an Irish citizen or entitled to be an Irish citizen at the
time of your birth, then you are entitled to become an Irish citizen.

To claim Irish citizenship, you must have your birth registered in the [
Foreign Births Register ](/en/moving-country/irish-citizenship/foreign-births-
register/) , unless your parent was abroad in the public service at the time
of your birth. If you are entitled to register, your Irish citizenship is
effective from the date of registration â€“ not from the date when you were
born.
