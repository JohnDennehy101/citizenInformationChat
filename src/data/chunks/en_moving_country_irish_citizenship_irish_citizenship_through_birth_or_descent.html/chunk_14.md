###  Other Irish ancestors

Unless at least one parent or an Irish-born grandparent was an Irish citizen
at the time of your birth, you have no automatic right to Irish citizenship on
the basis of extended previous ancestry (that is, ancestors other than your
parents or grandparents). In addition, you cannot claim Irish citizenship on
the basis that a relation such as a cousin, aunt or uncle was an Irish citizen
if none of your parents or grandparents was an Irish citizen at the time of
your birth.

You can, however, apply for citizenship based on Irish associations, which is
at the discretion of the Minister. Irish association means that you are
related by blood or through adoption to an Irish citizen.

If you are considering making an application based on Irish descent or
association, you should note the following:

  * You should have a reasonable period of legal residence in Ireland (at least 3 years) to show that you have a connection to Ireland. 
  * Applications based on descent from an Irish citizen going further back than a great-grandparent are generally refused. 
  * Applications based on being the parent or grandparent of an Irish citizen (by ‘ascent’), or the brother or sister of an Irish citizen are generally refused. 
  * Applications based on Irish descent or associations can take up to 30 months to process.
