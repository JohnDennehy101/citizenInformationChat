###  How is my income assessed?

Your total household income from the **previous tax year** is assessed to find
out if you qualify and how much of a grant you will get.

Household income includes:

  * Your annual gross income (income before tax) 
  * Your spouse or partners annual gross income 
  * The annual gross income of any other adults living in the household who are aged over 23 years if they are in full-time education, or over 18 if they are not in full-time education
