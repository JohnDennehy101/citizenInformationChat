##  What happens after I send my application?

When your local authority receives your application, they will:

  * Check your application and see if you qualify for the grant 
  * Send a technician to visit your home to make sure that it is possible to do the work and that the adaptations are suitable for your needs 
  * Contact you to let you know if your application has been approved and how much you have been approved for 
  * Ask you to send them a quote for the work, your contractorâ€™s tax reference number and your bank account details
