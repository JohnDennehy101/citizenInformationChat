##  Jobseekerâ€™s Benefit for people over 65

As a general rule, Jobseeker's Benefit (JB) is paid for either 9 months or 6
months. However, if you are aged between 65 and 66 when your JB would normally
end, you can continue to get it until the age of 66, provided you meet the
PRSI requirements. Find out more about [ qualifying for a payment at 65
