##  Introduction

There are some special administrative provisions in place for older
jobseekers. These provisions aim to help people during the transition from the
labour force into retirement. These provisions recognise that older jobseekers
may have more difficulty re-training and re-entering the workplace if they
lose their job when they are near to retirement age. If you have to retire at
65, you will not get a [ State pension ](/en/social-welfare/older-and-retired-
people/income-supports-for-older-people/) until you are 66. However, you may
still qualify for a [ benefit payment at 65
](https://www.gov.ie/en/service/49d25-benefit-payment-for-65-year-
olds/?referrer=http://www.gov.ie/bp65/) .
