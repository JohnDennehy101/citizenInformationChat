##  Introduction

You can claim tax relief on the cost of employing a carer if you employ one
for yourself or for another family member.

You can employ the carer directly or you can use an agency that employs
carers. If you employ the carer yourself, you should [ register as an employer
](https://revenue.ie/en/employing-people/becoming-an-employer-and-ongoing-
obligations/registration-of-employers-for-paye-purposes/index.aspx) and you
will be responsible for your employee's tax and social insurance ( [ PAYE
](/en/employment/starting-work-and-changing-job/starting-work/tax-and-
starting-work/) , Universal Social Charge and [ PRSI ](/en/social-
welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/social-insurance-prsi/paying-social-
insurance/) ). You will also have other duties and obligations as an employer,
for example regarding [ hours of work ](/en/employment/employment-rights-and-
conditions/hours-of-work/working-hours/) , [ contracts of employment
](/en/employment/employment-rights-and-conditions/contracts-of-
employment/contract-of-employment/) , [ pay slips ](/en/employment/employment-
rights-and-conditions/pay-and-employment/pay-slip/) , [ holidays
](/en/employment/employment-rights-and-conditions/leave-and-holidays/annual-
leave/) and the [ minimum wage ](/en/employment/employment-rights-and-
conditions/pay-and-employment/minimum-wage/) .  
  
If you pay an agency to provide the carer, the agency will employ the carer
and be responsible for their tax and social insurance. You can still claim tax
relief on the cost of paying the agency to provide a carer.
