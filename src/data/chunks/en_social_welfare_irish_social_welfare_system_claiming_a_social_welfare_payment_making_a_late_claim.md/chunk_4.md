###  **When to apply for a payment**

You should apply for a payment as soon as you think you might be entitled to
it. See [ a table showing the timeframe to apply for various payments
](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/723465-operational-guidelines-claims-and-
late-claims/#claiming-within-the-prescribed-
time:~:text=entitled%20to%20it.-,Table%20showing%20the%20prescribed%20time%20for%20making%20a%20claim%20and%20the%20late%20claim%20disqualification%20for%20each%20scheme%3A,-\(Article%20182%20of)
on Gov.ie.

If you apply late, you may get a payment from the date you sent your
application to the DSP.

You may not get your payment backdated to the **time you were entitled to it
but did not apply** .
