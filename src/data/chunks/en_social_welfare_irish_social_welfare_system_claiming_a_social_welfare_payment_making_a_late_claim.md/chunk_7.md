###  **Backdating your claim with good reason**

If your payment is not automatically backdated, you must give the DSP a 'good
reason' why you didn't apply [ within the normal time limit
](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/723465-operational-guidelines-claims-and-
late-claims/#claiming-within-the-prescribed-
time:~:text=Table%20showing%20the%20prescribed%20time%20for,12%20months%20before%20date%20of%20claim)
. There is little information about what is a good reason, but if you were
sick or in hospital this might be considered as a good reason for not making
your claim on time.

Generally, the fact that you did not know that you were entitled to a payment
is not considered to be a good reason for not making your claim on time.

reason for applying late:
