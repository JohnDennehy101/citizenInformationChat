##  What if Iâ€™m late to apply for a payment?

If you are late to apply for a payment, you may get it backdated. Depending on
the payment you are applying for and the reason for your late claim, you may
get your payment backdated to:

  * The time you became entitled to it, or 
  * At least 6 months before you applied.
