##  What is a dietician?

A dietician is a health professional who is qualified to give information on
all aspects of nutrition, diet and other areas to help you stay healthy and
manage illness.

You can visit a dietitian in a hospital (as an in-patient or outpatient) or in
the community (at a clinic or in a care centre).
