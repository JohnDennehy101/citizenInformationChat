###  How are applications prioritised?

Your application is prioritised according to how urgent your medical needs
are. There are 3 levels of priority.

**Priority 1** is given to people who:

  * Are terminally ill or are dependent on family or a carer 
  * Would be able to return home from hospital or residential care if they had the adaptations to their home 

**Priority 2** is given to people who:

  * Are mobile but need help to access their bedroom or bathroom 
  * Find it harder to be independent without the adaptations 

**Priority 3** is given to people who are independent but need adaptations to
improve their quality of life.
