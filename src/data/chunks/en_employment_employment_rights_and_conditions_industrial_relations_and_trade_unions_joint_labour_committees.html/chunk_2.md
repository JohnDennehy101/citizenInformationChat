##  What is a Joint Labour Committee?

A Joint Labour Committee (JLC) is an independent body made up of equal numbers
of employer and worker representatives. A JLC sets the employment conditions
and minimum rates of pay for employees in a certain sector, for example,
contract cleaning.

JLCs are set up by the Labour Court following an application from either:

  * The Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment 
  * A trade union 
  * Any organisation that represents the workers or the employers involved 

The chairman and substitute chairman of a JLC is appointed by the Minister for
Enterprise, Trade and Employment.
