##  What is a safety order?

A [ safety order ](https://services.courts.ie/Family-Law/domestic-
violence/understanding-court-orders-and-eligibility/what-is-a-safety-order) is
an instruction from the court which stops the person accused of abusive
behaviour (the respondent) from committing further violence or threats of
violence. The respondent does not have to leave the home. If the person is not
living with you, the safety order prohibits (bans) them from watching or being
near your home and following or communicating (including electronically) with
you or a dependent person such as a child. A safety order can last up to 5
years.

People in an intimate relationship are also able for apply for a safety order.
Previously, couples had to cohabit (live together) to be able to get a safety
order, but this is no longer the case. The following people can apply for a
safety order:

  * Spouses and civil partners 
  * Parents with a child in common 
  * Partners in an intimate relationship including cohabitants (a couple living together) and dating partners (a couple not living together) 
  * Parents of an abusive child if that child is over 18 
  * People residing with the respondent in a non-contractual relationship, such as two relatives living together 

Former partners are also able to apply, for example, a former spouse or
cohabitant.
