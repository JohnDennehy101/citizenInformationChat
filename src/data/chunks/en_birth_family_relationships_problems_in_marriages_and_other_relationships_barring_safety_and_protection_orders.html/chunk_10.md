##  Applying for an order

To get a safety or barring order you must attend a District Court hearing.
While you are waiting for the court to hear your application, the court can
give you an immediate order.

In an emergency situation, the Garda√≠ can request that the Courts Service
arrange a special out-of-hours sitting of the District Court for someone
looking for an interim barring order, protection order or emergency barring
order.

A safety order or barring order can be renewed by applying for a further order
before the previous one expires.
