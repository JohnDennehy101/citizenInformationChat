###  What is a protection order?

Between the time of making an application for a safety order (or barring
order) and the courtâ€™s determination (decision), there may be reasonable
grounds for believing that the safety and welfare of you or of a dependent
person is at risk. If so, the court can grant a protection order to prohibit
(ban) the person accused of the abusive behaviour from:

  * Using or threatening to use violence 
  * If the person is not living with you, watching or being near your home 
  * Following or communicating with you or a dependent person 

A protection order is temporary and only effective until the court hearing for
the application for a safety order (or barring order). It is sometimes called
a 'temporary safety order' because it gives the same protection as a safety
order but for a shorter time period.
