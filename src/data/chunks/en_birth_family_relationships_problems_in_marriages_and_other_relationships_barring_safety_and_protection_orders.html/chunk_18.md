###  What happens if an order is broken?

Anyone who breaks a court order (safety order, protection order, barring
order, interim barring order or emergency barring order) is guilty of an
offence. If the person accused of violence or domestic abuse prevents you or
your dependants from entering or remaining in a place to which the order
relates (while the order is in effect), this is also an offence.

The above offences under Section 33 of the Domestic Violence Act 2018 are
punishable by a [ class B fine ](/en/justice/criminal-law/criminal-
trial/fines-for-criminal-offences/) , a prison term of up to 12 months, or
both.

When the court is deciding the sentencing for certain offences such as
psychological, physical violence, sexual violence, coercive control and
stalking, it is now considered an aggravating circumstance if the victim is or
was a spouse, civil partner or in an intimate relationship with the offender.
This means the court shall give a sentence which is greater than would have
been given because of the fact that the victim and perpetrator (abuser) were
in an intimate relationship. This is introduced by [ Section 40 of the
Domestic Violence Act 2018
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2018/act/6/section/40/enacted/en/html#sec40)
