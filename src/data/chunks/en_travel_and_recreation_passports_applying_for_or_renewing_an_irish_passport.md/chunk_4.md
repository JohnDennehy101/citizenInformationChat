###  Digital photographs

You must include a digital photo as part of your online application.

You can do this in 3 ways:

  * Have your photo taken at a participating photo provider, who will give you a unique code to include with your online application. 
  * Have your photo taken at a photo provider, and ask them to email it to you, or save the photo on a USB device, or another storage method. You must have access to the photo when completing your online application. 
  * Take a photo at home using a digital camera or smartphone. This cannot be a “selfie” and you should not use the zoom function of your camera. The photo must capture your image from the waist upwards.
