###  Additional (unpaid) maternity leave

You can take up to a further 16 weeks’ additional maternity leave immediately
after your maternity leave ends. This additional maternity leave is often
called ‘unpaid maternity leave’ because you are not covered by Maternity
Benefit and your employer does not have to pay you during it.
