###  Parent’s leave and Parent’s Benefit

[ Parent’s leave
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/employment/employment-rights-and-
conditions/leave-and-holidays/parents-leave/) is a statutory entitlement for
working parents. The leave lets parents spend more time with their baby or
adopted child during the first two years. From August 2024, each parent is
entitled to 9 weeks of parent’s leave for a child born or adopted on or after
1 August 2024, a child who is under the age of 2 on 1 August 2024 or an
adopted child who has been placed with the family less than 2 years on 1
August 2024.

The leave period remains the same in the case of multiple births, for example,
if you have twins or if you adopt 2 or more children at the same time.
Parent’s leave is available to both employees and people who are self-
employed.

[ Parent’s Benefit ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-
welfare/social-welfare-payments/families-and-children/parents-benefit/) is
paid while you are on parent’s leave from work if you have enough social
insurance (PRSI) contributions.
