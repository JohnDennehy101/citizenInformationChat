###  Antenatal classes

Antenatal classes give you information about pregnancy, labour and delivery,
and baby care. Before the birth you are entitled to take paid time off work to
attend one set of [ antenatal classes ](/en/birth-family-relationships/before-
your-baby-is-born/antenatal-classes/) (however, not the last 3 in the set).
This is a once-off right which covers all pregnancies while in employment.
Expectant fathers have a once-off right to attend the last 2 antenatal classes
in the set.
