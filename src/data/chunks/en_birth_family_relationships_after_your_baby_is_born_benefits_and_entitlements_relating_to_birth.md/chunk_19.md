###  Early childhood care and pre-school education

The [ Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) Scheme ](/en/education/pre-
school-education-and-childcare/early-childhood-care-and-education-scheme/)
provides free early childhood care and education for 2 years for children of
pre-school age for a set number of hours over a set period of weeks from
September to June (the school year).

The new [ National Childcare Scheme (NCS) ](/en/education/pre-school-
education-and-childcare/national-childcare-scheme/) ‘wraps-around’ the free
pre-school programme, providing financial support towards the cost of
childcare for the hours spent outside of pre-school. The National Childcare
Scheme provides 2 types of childcare subsidy paid directly to your chosen
childcare provider. Children must be attending a childcare provider registered
with [ Tusla ](/en/birth-family-relationships/services-and-supports-for-
children/tusla-the-child-and-family-agency/) (including childminders and
school-age childcare services).
