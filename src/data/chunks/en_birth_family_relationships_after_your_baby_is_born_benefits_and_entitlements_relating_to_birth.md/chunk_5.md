###  Antenatal visits or appointments

After your pregnancy is confirmed, you may take time off for medical visits
(sometimes called [ antenatal visits or appointments ](/en/birth-family-
relationships/before-your-baby-is-born/antenatal-visits/) ) connected with the
pregnancy. There is no maximum or minimum amount of time off specified for
these visits. Rather, you are entitled to reasonable time off â€“ this means the
time that you need for each visit and includes both the time required to
travel to and from the appointment and the time for the appointment itself.
You are entitled to be paid during these antenatal visits.
