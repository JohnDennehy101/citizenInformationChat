[ Child Benefit ](/en/social-welfare/families-and-children/child-benefit/) is
a monthly payment to the parents or guardians of children under 16 years of
age. You can get Child Benefit for children aged 16 and 17, if they are in
full-time education or full-time training, or have a disability and cannot
support themselves.

From 1 May 2024, Child Benefit will be extended to children aged 18 who are in
full-time education or who have a disability until their 19th birthday.

In general, Child Benefit is payable from the first day of the month after the
child is born. It is paid at higher rates for multiple births such as twins or
triplets.
