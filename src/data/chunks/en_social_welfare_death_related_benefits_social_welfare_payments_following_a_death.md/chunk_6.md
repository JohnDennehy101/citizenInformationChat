###  Death of a child dependant

If your child dies, the [ Increase for a Qualified Child (IQC) ](/en/social-
welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/claiming-a-social-welfare-
payment/claiming-and-increase-in-your-payment-for-a-child-dependant/) on your
social welfare payment will continue for 6 weeks, if the child was included in
your payment. Contact the section of the Department of Social Protection
responsible for your payment.

Where there is one qualified child on a [ One-Parent Family Payment (OFP)
](/en/social-welfare/families-and-children/one-parent-family-payment/) and
that child dies, the OFP and IQC will continue for 6 weeks.
