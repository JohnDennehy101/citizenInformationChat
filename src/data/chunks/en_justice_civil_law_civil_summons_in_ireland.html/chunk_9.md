##  Counterclaim

When you receive a claim notice, you may decide that not only have you done
nothing wrong and the claim should not have been brought against you, but the
claimant has actually caused you damage. In those circumstances, you may wish
to bring a claim against the claimant for damages.

To make a claim against the claimant (called a _counterclaim_ ) you must
include a [ notice and statement of counterclaim
](https://www.courts.ie/acc/alfresco/269d5e24-5305-463b-82e4-58181471951b/Statement%20of%20counterclaim%20No.%2042.08.docx/file#view=fitH)
in the appearance and defence which must be filed with the District Court
clerk and served on the claimant.

The claimant will then have a similar opportunity to file a defence to the
counterclaim.
