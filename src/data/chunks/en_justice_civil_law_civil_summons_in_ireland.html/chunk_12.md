##  Setting down for trial

When the appearance and defence have been served and filed by the respondent,
the claimant can serve [ notice of trial
](https://www.courts.ie/acc/alfresco/422a0eab-8d63-4467-acfe-66f7f11335c7/Notice%20of%20trial%20No.%2049.01.docx/file#view=fitH)
on the respondent. On occasion, however, other applications are necessary
before the action can be set down for trial. These applications are known as
_interlocutory applications_ .

Unless otherwise agreed, not less than 10 days’ notice of trial must be given.
The notice must be filed with the District Court clerk without delay following
service.

If the claimant fails to serve notice of trial with 10 days of receiving the
respondent’s defence, the respondent can serve notice of trial on the
claimant. Alternatively, the respondent can apply to the Court by [ notice of
motion
](https://www.courts.ie/acc/alfresco/079a8d5f-a0d5-4b0a-b589-95b72e954e1a/Notice%20of%20motion%20-%20general%20No.%2044.01.docx/file#view=fitH)
to dismiss the claim for want of prosecution.

Whoever is filing the notice of trial must at the same time file with the
clerk, for use by the judge:

  * A set of copies of the pleadings, including particulars, and any affidavits in the case, in chronological sequence 
  * A set of copies of any correspondence relied on by either party, in chronological sequence 
  * Copies of any other documents they are directed to file 

They may also be directed to file a completed [ case management questionnaire

.

In general, the claim is set down for trial at the next available sitting
following the notice period.
