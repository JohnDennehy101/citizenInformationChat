###  Make a formal complaint

If the issue is still not resolved, you should put your complaint in writing
(letter or email) stating all the facts of the case so far. You should include
any relevant documents that support your complaint (copies only).

You should include the following in your complaint:

  * Description of the product or service - order or booking number, batch codes, serial number or other features 
  * Quote your reference or account number, if you have one 
  * The date you bought the item and when the problem started 
  * The steps taken so far, including when you first made a complaint and who you spoke to 
  * If you can, refer to the law or a description of your rights and how you want the issue to be put right 
  * The next steps you will take if you are not satisfied with the response you get from the seller (for example, reporting it to an enforcement body or taking legal action) 

If you are unsure of what to include or need help writing a formal complaint,
you can use the CCPC’s [ complaint template letter
](https://www.ccpc.ie/consumers/consumer-template-letter/) .

For cross-boarder complaints to businesses in the EU, Iceland and Norway, the
European Consumer Commission (ECC) Ireland provide [ letter templates
](https://www.eccireland.ie/templates/) you can use.

Check you are sending the complaint to the right person or department. You can
find contact details in the customer care section of the website, the
company’s complaints procedure or in the contract terms and conditions. If
not, phone the seller directly and ask for the name and address of a contact
person.

Keep a copy of the complaint letter or email as you will need this if you
decide to take your complaint further. It is a good idea to send the letter by
registered post or attach a read receipt to your email. This means you have
proof that you sent the complaint and it was received by the seller.
