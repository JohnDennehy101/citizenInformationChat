##  How do I take my complaint further?

If the seller takes too long to resolve your complaint or you are not
satisfied with the response, you can get help and advice from an independent [
consumer protection organisation ](/en/consumer/how-to-complain/consumer-
protection-organisations/) .

Some organisations also provide dispute resolution services. This means that
they can step in to help you resolve the dispute with the trader. Other
organisations have the power to prosecute against traders or recommend the
actions the trader must take.

The [ Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC)
](https://www.ccpc.ie/) has a consumer helpline and website that gives
consumers information on their rights.

There are other independent bodies who deal with specific industries,
including:

  * **Air passenger rights (cancellation, delay or denied boarding** : [ The Irish Aviation Authority (IAA) ](https://www.iaa.ie/) . The IAA has taken on functions previously held by the Commission for Aviation Regulation (CAR) 
  * **Financial services** : the [ Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman (FSPO) ](https://www.fspo.ie/)
  * **Communications or postal services** : [ Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg) ](https://www.comreg.ie/)
  * **Energy or water services** : [ Commission for Regulation of Utilities (CRU) ](https://www.cru.ie/)

The Office of the Ombudsman has a useful guide on [ Ombudsman Offices in
Ireland (pdf) ](https://www.ombudsman.ie/making-a-complaint/if-we-cant-
help/Ombudsman-Offices-in-Ireland-\(Web-Eng-A4\).pdf) . It can help you
identify the correct ombudsman to deal with your complaint.
