###  Gather documentation and evidence of the problem

Before you start, gather all the facts, any receipts and other documentation
about your complaint, including:

  * **Proof of purchase** : you must be able to prove that you bought the products or services. Proof of purchase can be a receipt, a credit card statement, or an order or booking confirmation 
  * **Evidence of the problem:** for example, photographs or video (particularly useful when proving the date of when and how a problem occurred) 
  * **Guarantee or warranty** : you must be able to provide proof that your guarantee or warranty is still in date and covers the issue. You can read more about [ guarantees and warranties ](/en/consumer/shopping/guarantees-and-warranties/)
