###  Guide dog training

You must be at least 16 years old to get a guide dog. However, you can apply
for a guide dog before you are 16 and go on the waiting list.

If your application for a guide dog is successful, you will be placed on a
waiting list. Then, when a dog becomes available that matches your needs, you
will be given training in how to use the dog.

You will need to attend a 3-week residential training programme at the Irish
Guide Dogs training centre. The instructors will work with you and your dog on
everyday skills, from crossing roads to using public transport. They also
provide training on dog handling, feeding, grooming and vet care.

Irish Guide Dogs for the Blind do not charge for training courses or
equipment. However, you must pay €10 per week for board and lodging on their
residential training courses.

When you finish the training you can bring your guide dog home and an
instructor will call in to help with the ‘settling in process’. You will get
regular support from your instructor after the course.
