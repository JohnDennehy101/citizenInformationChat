##  Guide dogs and training

Guide dogs can help someone with a visual impairment to get around safely.
Irish Guide Dogs for the Blind provide guide dogs to people with visual
impairments. They also provide training so people can learn how to work with a
guide dog.

Only certain breeds of dogs can become guide dogs in Ireland. The main breeds
used are labradors, golden retrievers, crosses of these breeds and German
shepherd crosses.

Dogs that become guide dogs are trained by Irish Guide Dogs for the Blind.
Puppies are fostered by families for 12 months and are then returned to the
Irish Guide Dogs for the Blind to train for 8 months. A family pet or puppy
cannot be trained to be a guide dog.
