##  How to reserve a car registration plate

Download and complete an [ application form VRT15A (pdf)
](https://www.revenue.ie/en/importing-vehicles-duty-free-
allowances/documents/vrt/vrt-15a.pdf) to reserve a registration number (one
form per registration number) and send it with the appropriate fee to the
National VRT Services (see 'Where to apply' below). You can also send it
through [ MyEnquiries ](https://www.revenue.ie/en/online-
services/services/manage-your-record/myenquiries.aspx) to the National VRT
Services in Revenue.

Successful applicants will be notified on Form VRT 15N, and you must present
this form when you are registering the vehicle.

If you are unsuccessful in your application, you will be notified by the
National VRT Services and your fee will be refunded.

If a successful applicant does not use the registration number within a
reasonable time, it will be cancelled. However, the fee will only be refunded
in exceptional circumstances.
