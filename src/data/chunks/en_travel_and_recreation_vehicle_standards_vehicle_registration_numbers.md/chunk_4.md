###  Reserving a vehicle registration number

You can apply to reserve a vehicle registration number plate on or after 1
November of the year before you intend to bring the vehicle into use. In other
words, you can only apply to reserve a vehicle registration number plate on or
after 1 November 2024 to use this plate in 2025.

The number you reserve must:

  * Be in the normal format 
  * Correspond with the licensing authority area where you live 
  * Show the year and half year in which the vehicle is to be first brought into use 

For example, 242-D-111 can only be reserved by someone living in Dublin for a
vehicle intended to be brought into use in the second half of 2024.

The registered owner of the vehicle must be the person in whose name the
number was reserved. You cannot transfer a reserved number.

All registration numbers are available for reservation, apart from plates that
are reserved for the Mayor and Lord Mayor of Cork, Dublin, Limerick and
Waterford. These registration plates cannot be reserved:

  * 241-C-1 
  * 242-C-1 
  * 241-D-1 
  * 242-D-1 
  * 241-L-1 
  * 242-L-1 
  * 241-W-1 
  * 242-W-1 

A reserved registration number can only be assigned to a vehicle when it has
been reached in the normal sequence. It may not be displayed on a vehicle
before it has been formally assigned by the Revenue Commissioners following a
completed declaration for registration.

Applications will be processed on receipt on the first working day of
November.

No priority will be given to applications received before this date.
