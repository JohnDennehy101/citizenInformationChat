###  **Checks for children with asthma**

If your child has asthma, they will get free asthma checks and their
medication reviewed, to make sure that they are using their inhalers
correctly. You will also get a written plan to help you manage your child’s
asthma.

Children over 2 will get their first free asthma check when they are
diagnosed. The second check is arranged 3 months after their first check.

Your child’s asthma will be checked for free every year until they are 8.
