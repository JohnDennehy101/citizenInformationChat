##  Cost of vaccines for travel

Travel vaccinations are not free in Ireland through the public health system -
even if you hold a medical card. You will have to pay the full cost of
vaccinations. A charge will usually be made for your visit to the doctor and
in addition, you will have to pay for each vaccine or set of tablets
prescribed.
