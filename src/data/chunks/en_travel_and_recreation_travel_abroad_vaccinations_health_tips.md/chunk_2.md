##  Introduction

If you normally live in Ireland and are travelling abroad, you should check
whether you need vaccinations to travel to the country or countries you plan
to visit. Vaccines should be considered if you are travelling to areas outside
of Western Europe, North America, Australia, and New Zealand. Health risks
vary from country to country, so seek advice from your family doctor ( [ GP
](/en/health/health-services/gp-and-hospital-services/) ), [ Health Service
Executive (HSE) ](/en/health/health-system/health-service-executive/) , travel
health clinic or travel agent in advance of travel.

The HSE has information on [ travel-associated infectious
](https://www.hse.ie/eng/health/az/t/travel-vaccinations/when-travel-
vaccinations-are-necessary.html) such as yellow fever, typhoid or [ Hepatitis
A ](https://www2.hse.ie/conditions/hepatitis/) on its website.

You can get travel advice from the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) on the
country that you plan to visit. The [ World Health Organisation
](http://www.who.int/countries/en/) (WHO) also provides some information.
