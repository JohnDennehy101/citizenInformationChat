###  Appealing the refusal of Mobility Allowance

There is no statutory appeal scheme for Mobility Allowance. In other words, if
you have been refused Mobility Allowance by your Local Health Office, your
right to appeal is not set down in law. Where an applicant is refused, the HSE
will formally notify you of their decision (in writing) and include details of
how to appeal this decision.

Appeal procedures for Mobility Allowance can vary from one Local Health Office
to another. Some Local Health Offices for example, will conduct a review
hearing' where independent Senior Medical Officers will meet the applicant and
review their application, including the medical evidence. Other Local Health
Offices may refer the appeal to their Appeals Office for review. Contact your
Local Health Office for information on the appeals process in your area.
