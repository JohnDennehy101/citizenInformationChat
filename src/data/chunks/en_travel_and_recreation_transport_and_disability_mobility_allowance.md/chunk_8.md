###  Motorised Transport Grant  

If you receive a [ Motorised Transport Grant ](/en/travel-and-
recreation/transport-and-disability/motorised-transport-grant/) , having
previously received the Mobility Allowance, you will no longer receive the
Mobility Allowance. This is because the payment of a Motorised Transport Grant
is subject to the condition that the HSE will not be called upon at any future
date to contribute towards the running costs of the vehicle.

You will not be eligible for the Mobility Allowance again until three years
after the date of payment of the Motorised Transport Grant.
