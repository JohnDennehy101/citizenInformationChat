###  Assessing income

To determine the amount of Mobility Allowance you will receive, you calculate
your total assessable income. Some income is not assessable (see Non-
Assessable Income below). In the case of a couple both your incomes are added
together. Any amount in excess of the _appropriate weekly social welfare
payment_ for your family is deducted from the maximum amount of weekly
Mobility Allowance payable to you.

The appropriate social welfare payment is Disability Allowance where you are
under age 66 and State Pension (Non-Contributory) where you are over age 66.
The appropriate weekly payment depends on whether you are a couple and have
dependent children or not. To calculate the maximum weekly Mobility Allowance,
you multiply the monthly rate (see Rates below) by 12 and then divide by 52.

In the case of a couple where both of you are eligible, half of any amount in
excess of the appropriate weekly social welfare payment for your family is
deducted from the maximum amount of weekly Mobility Allowance payable to you.
