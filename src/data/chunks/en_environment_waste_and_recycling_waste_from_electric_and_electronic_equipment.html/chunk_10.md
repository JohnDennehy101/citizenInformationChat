##  Will local authorities take my WEEE?

Local authorities have initiatives for handling WEEE in their general waste
management plans.

You can take your WEEE free of charge to your local civic amenity site, where
it will be collected for recycling instead of being sent to a landfill site.

For information on initiatives in your area and for advice on how to deal with
WEEE, contact your [ local authority
](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/942f74-local-authorities/) .
