##  How can WEEE damage the environment?

The main risks to the environment from WEEE are the depletion of natural
resources and the release of dangerous substances.

If we send electrical and electronic products to landfill sites instead of
recycling them, we miss the opportunity to recover and reuse millions of
tonnes of materials. If we recycle these materials, this means we need to
extract less raw material to manufacture new products.

Some electronic equipment contains substances that are considered dangerous to
the environment and human health if they arenâ€™t disposed of properly.

Although these dangerous substances are usually present in only small amounts,
they may leak into the soil, water or air and can cause serious environmental
damage.
