###  **Who does not have to register with Tusla?**

Certain pre-school care providers do not have to notify Tusla.

These include:

  * A relative of the child or the spouse of such a relative (that is, the brother, sister, aunt, uncle, grandparent or step-parent of the child) 
  * If you are caring for one or more pre-school children of the same family and no other children (other than your own) in your own home 
  * If you are caring for not more than 3 pre-school children from different families (other than your own) in your own home
