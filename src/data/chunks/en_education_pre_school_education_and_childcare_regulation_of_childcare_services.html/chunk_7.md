###  **Health, welfare and development of the child**

Each child’s learning, development and well-being must be facilitated by the
service. The service must provide appropriate:

  * Activities and interaction 
  * Materials and equipment 
  * Care practices 

These should be appropriate based on the child’s age, stage of development,
and the number of children attending the service and the nature of their
needs.
