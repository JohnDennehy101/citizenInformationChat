##  Can I apply for Telephone Support Allowance?

You do not need to apply for the Telephone Support Allowance (TSA) because it
is paid automatically to people who qualify. There is no application form.

If you think you qualify for TSA but haven’t received an automatic payment,
you should contact the section in the [ Department of Social Protection
](https://www.gov.ie/en/service/4d2773-telephone-support-
allowance/?referrer=https://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/Telephone-Support-
Allowance.aspx#apply) that pays your main social welfare payment (see the list
of qualifying payments in ‘How to qualify for Telephone Support Allowance’
above).
