##  Rules banning false and misleading advertising

The rules covering advertising in Ireland are set out under both legislation
and codes of practice. The main law covering advertising in Ireland is the [
Consumer Protection Act 2007
](https://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2007/act/19/enacted/en/html) and updated
by the [ Consumer Rights Act 2022
](https://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2022/act/37/enacted/en/html) . The law
protects consumers from misleading or false advertising.

It is an offence for a business to make false claims about products, services
or prices. Enforcement bodies can take action against a business that does not
comply with the rules – see ‘Who enforces the rules?' ’ below.

The law also recognises the various codes of practices that are published and
enforced by regulatory bodies. Where a business does not follow the code of
practice, the regulatory body can tell the business to change or withdraw the
advert.

EU laws on [ misleading advertising

and [ unfair sales practices ](/en/consumer/advertising-and-promotions/unfair-
sales-practices/) also ban misleading advertising in all Member States.
