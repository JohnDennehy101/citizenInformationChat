###  The Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC)

The CCPC is an independent statutory body with responsibility for enforcing
competition and consumer protection law in Ireland.

The Consumer Protection Act gives the CCPC certain enforcement powers when
there is a breach of consumer legislation or fair trading. This includes the
power to take court action, where appropriate, against businesses that have
misled consumers with misleading or false advertising.

You can complain to the CCPC if you believe that an advert is misleading or
false and this had a major effect on your decision to buy. The CCPC website
has more information about [ misleading advertising
