###  What if I am not available on the court date?

If you cannot attend court on the date of the hearing, you should tell the
District Court office and the respondent immediately.

You may ask to have the date adjourned (changed to another date). Only the
judge can make this order and you must have a very good reason for not being
able to attend or go ahead with the case on that date.

If you cannot attend yourself, you can send a representative to make the
request to the court on your behalf.
