###  The respondentâ€™s defence

The procedure for the respondent making their defence follows the same steps
as it does for you. You will be able to question the respondent and any
witnesses they may call to give evidence.

You can prepare for this by:

  * Studying any documentation the respondent shared during the small claims procedure, such as the Notice of Dispute and Counterclaim forms 
  * Preparing questions to ask in court 

You should also listen carefully to what the respondent says while in the
witness box as you can challenge any evidence you do not agree with at this
time.
