##  What happens if my small claim cannot be resolved?

If your [ small claims procedure case ](/en/justice/courts-system/small-
claims-court/) could not be resolved, it will be referred for a hearing in the
[ District Court ](/en/justice/courts-system/district-court/) .

You will receive a letter from the District Court office with the date and
time of the court hearing, and the location of the court itself. The case will
be heard in public as part of a normal sitting of the District Court.

If you have made the claim, you are known as the claimant. The person you have
claimed against is known as the respondent.
