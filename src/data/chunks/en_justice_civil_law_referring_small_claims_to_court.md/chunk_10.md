###  Making your case

The judge will then ask you to begin your case. This is where you must give
your side of the dispute. You should make your case as clearly as possible and
support it with the relevant evidence.

When speaking to the judge, be sure to address them as “Judge” and direct all
answers to them.

The procedure for making your case usually takes the following steps:

  1. You present your case to the court. 
  2. The judge will ask you questions which you should answer as best as you can. 
  3. The respondent will be allowed to ask you questions, which you should answer as best as you can and without starting an argument. 
  4. You will be allowed to call your witnesses, if you have any, and they will be questioned by you and the respondent. 

Once you have given your evidence, the respondent will be asked to make their
defence and present their evidence. If your case is against a company, a
representative of the company will speak on its behalf.
