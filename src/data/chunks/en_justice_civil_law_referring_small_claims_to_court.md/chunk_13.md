###  If I win the case

If the judge decides in your favour, they will make an order or decree for the
respondent to resolve the claim. The judge can make any order they see fit and
they will make an order which suits your particular case.

They may order the respondent to:

  * Pay an amount of money 
  * Complete the service you asked for 
  * Repair the faulty goods 

If the court makes a decree for an amount of money to be paid, the respondent
has 28 calendar days to pay you.

If the court makes any other type of decree, it will usually set a time limit
for this to be completed.
