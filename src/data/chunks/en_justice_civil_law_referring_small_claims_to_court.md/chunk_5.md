###  What will I need to do in court?

You will need to tell the judge the nature of your relationship with the
respondent  
  
For example, you may be:

  * The consumer and the respondent is the retailer or service provider 
  * The owner of a property that the respondent has allegedly damaged 

You will also need to tell the court:

  * The details of the claim 
  * What went wrong and how you handled it 
  * How much you are claiming for 

You should also draw the courtâ€™s attention to any areas of consumer law that
are relevant to your situation.

Explaining the law can be difficult, so you may wish to:

  * Get legal advice from a [ solicitor ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/justice/courtroom/solicitors/)
  * Contact the [ Free Legal Advice Centre ](/en/justice/legal-aid-and-advice/free-legal-advice-centre/) for some guidance 

You can read more about your [ consumer rights
