####  Witnesses

You can also get an independent opinion by an expert and have them appear as
your [ witness ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/justice/witnesses/) in
court. You are responsible for any expense this involves.

You can also ask any other person who can support your claim, especially in
cases of faulty service, to attend court as a witness. If necessary, you can
send them a [ witness summons ](/en/justice/witnesses/how-you-are-called-as-a-
witness#l47496) â€“ the Small Claims Registrar can issue this on your behalf for
a small fee.
