##  Why use mediation?

Workplace mediation allows a problem to be resolved informally, by making sure
that all the sides are heard.

Generally, reaching an agreement through mediation is quicker, cheaper, and
less stressful for everyone involved than formal adjudication or other third-
party processes.

As both parties work together to solve the problem, the resolution is in their
control. Where both you and your employer are committed to a mutually agreed
solution it is likely to be more effective and last longer.

The agreement reached through mediation is legally binding. This means it can
be enforced through the courts.

Mediation is used before the issue is referred for formal adjudication or
other third-party processes.
