##  Principles of mediation

The Mediation Service works on the following principles:

  * It is a voluntary process; all parties must agree to participate. 
  * Either party can withdraw from the process at any stage. 
  * The process is confidential unless the parties agree otherwise. 
  * It is fast and starts as soon as everyone is available. 
  * The mediator is impartial. 
  * Its focus is to find a solution to the dispute which is agreeable to all parties and which will work. 

The process aims to allow each person involved in the dispute the chance to be
heard and to work with the other party to reach a solution.

It is a flexible process that can include joint meetings or meetings with the
mediator alone, depending on the situation.
