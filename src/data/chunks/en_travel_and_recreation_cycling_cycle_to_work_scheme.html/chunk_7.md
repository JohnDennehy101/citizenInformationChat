##  What are the different kinds of bikes covered?

A cargo bike has a special purpose frame to carry heavy loads or other
passengers. A container or a platform may be integrated into, or attached to,
this frame in front of, or behind, the rider.

An ecargo bike is a cargo bike with a pedelec configuration. A bike cannot be
converted into a cargo bike by simply attaching a container or a trailer. The
frame must be specially designed to carry large or heavy loads or passengers.
