##  What is the Cycle to Work Scheme?

Under the Cycle to Work Scheme (also known as the Bike to Work Scheme), you
can get a new bike tax free through your work. Your employer pays for a new
bike and then you repay the cost of regular instalments from your gross
(overall) salary.

You do not have to pay [ tax, PRSI or the Universal Social Charge
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/money-and-tax/tax/income-tax/how-your-
tax-is-calculated/) on your repayments.

Not every employer takes part in the scheme. However, if they do, they must
offer it to all their employees.

If you are self-employed, you cannot take part in the Cycle to Work Scheme
unless you pay PRSI as an employee in addition to your self-employed work.
