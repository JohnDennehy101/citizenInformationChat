###  What is a holding deposit?

Some landlords or agents may ask you for a holding deposit when you decide to
take the accommodation. This is a sum of money you pay to hold the property
before you sign the lease and enter into a contract with the landlord. You
should always get a written receipt for a holding deposit. Holding deposits
are often not refundable if you donâ€™t take up the accommodation.
