###  Make an inventory

At the start of a tenancy ask the landlord for a written list of all
furnishings and appliances. You and the landlord should sign this list to show
that you agree on the furnishings supplied and their condition. This will help
to prevent disputes during your stay and when you are leaving. This list
should be included in the rent book.

Make sure that you note any signs of damage by previous tenants. You could
photograph or otherwise record the existing condition of the property
including any damage to walls, furniture or appliances.

If there are outstanding repairs, ask the landlord to state in writing that
they will be completed.
