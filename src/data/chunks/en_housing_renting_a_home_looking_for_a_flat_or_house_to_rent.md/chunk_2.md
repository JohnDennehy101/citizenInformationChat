##  What to consider before looking for somewhere to rent

It can be difficult to find private rented accommodation. So, to make sure you
find somewhere that suits you, you should consider these questions before
viewing places to rent:

  * How much can you afford in rent and bills? 
  * What is the standard of the accommodation? 
  * What is the [ Building Energy Rating (BER) ](/en/housing/owning-a-home/home-owners/getting-a-building-energy-rating-for-your-home/) of the property? 
  * What is the location of the property? Is it near to your work or college? 
  * How long do you plan to stay there? 
  * Do you you want to share a bedroom, bathroom or kitchen?
