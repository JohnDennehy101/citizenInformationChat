###  **Types of rental scams**

Rental scams generally fall into one of the following 3 categories:

  * The scammer asks for a deposit but claims they canâ€™t show you the property as they are out of the country 
  * The scammer is living at the property, shows it to different people and asks for rent off each one. They then disappear with the money. 
  * The process seems to go as normal, however, you are given fake keys and the scammer disappears
