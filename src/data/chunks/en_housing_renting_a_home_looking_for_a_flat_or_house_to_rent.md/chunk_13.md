###  what is a security deposit?

You will be asked for a security deposit before moving into the accommodation.
The landlord holds this deposit as security to cover any rent arrears, bills
owing or damage beyond normal wear and tear at the end of the tenancy.

**How much should I pay for a deposit?**

You cannot be forced to make upfront payments of more than 2 month’s rent.
This includes a deposit of a month’s rent and one month’s rent in advance.
This restriction applies to all tenancies created from 9 August 2021 and is
set out in the [ Residential Tenancies (No. 2) Act 2021
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2021/act/17/enacted/en/html) .

Students in student-specific tenancies can opt-out of this restriction and pay
a larger upfront payment if they want. The RTB has a [ guidance document (pdf)

and [ FAQs (pdf)

about this legislation.

**Can I get help to pay a deposit?**

If you are getting a social welfare payment and are unable to pay the deposit,
the Department of Social Protection’s representative (formerly the Community
Welfare Officer) may be able to [ help with paying a deposit under the
Supplementary Welfare Allowance Scheme ](/en/social-welfare/supplementary-
welfare-schemes/additional-needs-payment/) .

If you are in emergency homeless accommodation, your local authority may help
with your deposit to get accommodation under the HAP scheme. You should
contact the housing section of your local authority for further information on
this.

**Can I lose my deposit?**

You should get a receipt for any deposit you pay. Your [ rent book
](/en/housing/renting-a-home/tenants-rights-and-responsibilities/rent-books/)
should state how much of a deposit you paid. You may lose your deposit if:

  * You leave without giving proper notice, or leave before the end of a fixed-term lease 
  * You cause damage to the accommodation beyond normal [ wear and tear ](https://www.rtb.ie/during-a-tenancy/wear-and-tear)
  * You leave with bills or rent unpaid.
