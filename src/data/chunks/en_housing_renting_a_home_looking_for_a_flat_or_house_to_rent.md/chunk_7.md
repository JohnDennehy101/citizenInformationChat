##  What should I do before I agree to rent somewhere?

**Make sure you can afford it**

Make sure that you can afford the rent being asked, either from your own
income or with available State support, such as:

  * [ Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) ](/en/housing/renting-a-home/help-with-renting/housing-assistance-payment/)
  * [ Rent Supplement ](/en/social-welfare/supplementary-welfare-schemes/rent-supplement/)
  * [ Rental Accommodation Scheme (RAS) ](/en/housing/local-authority-and-social-housing/rental-accommodation-scheme/)

If you will be claiming [ Rent Supplement ](/en/social-welfare/supplementary-
welfare-schemes/rent-supplement/) or [ HAP ](/en/housing/renting-a-home/help-
with-renting/housing-assistance-payment/) , make sure that you know the local
maximum rent level allowed. There is some flexibility in certain situations,
allowing for higher rents to be covered.
