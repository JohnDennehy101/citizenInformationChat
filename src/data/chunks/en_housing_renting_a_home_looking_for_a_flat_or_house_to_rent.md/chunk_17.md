###  **What should I do if I’ve been scammed?**

If you realise you’ve been scammed, you should contact your bank or credit
card company immediately.

If you have transferred money online or have given your bank details to
someone, your bank can cancel your cards.

If you have been charged already, you may be able to get the transaction
reversed.

You should report the incident to your local Garda station. You should also
report the scam to Threshold, who can help make other people aware of the
scam.
