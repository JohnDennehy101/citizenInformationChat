###  Know your rights and responsibilities

Be aware of [ your rights and your obligations as a tenant
](/en/housing/renting-a-home/tenants-rights-and-responsibilities/tenants-
rights-and-obligations/) and your [ landlord's rights and obligations
](/en/housing/renting-a-home/landlords-rights-and-responsibilities/landlords-
rights-and-obligations/) . For example, your landlord must provide you with a
[ rent book ](/en/housing/renting-a-home/tenants-rights-and-
responsibilities/rent-books/) and ensure that the accommodation meets certain
[ minimum physical standards ](/en/housing/renting-a-home/tenants-rights-and-
responsibilities/minimum-standards-for-rented-homes/) . They must also [
register the tenancy ](/en/housing/renting-a-home/landlords-rights-and-
responsibilities/registering-a-tenancy/) with the [ Residential Tenancies
Board (RTB) ](/en/housing/renting-a-home/resolving-disputes/residential-
tenancies-board/) every year.

If the landlord wants you to sign a fixed-term lease, don't agree unless you
are sure you want to stay for that length of time. If you leave before the end
of a fixed-term lease, you may lose your deposit.

If you are renting a **room** in your landlord's home, your tenancy is not
covered by landlord and tenant legislation, but it is covered if you are
renting a self-contained apartment or flat. Read more in our document on [
Sharing accommodation with your landlord ](/en/housing/renting-a-home/tenants-
rights-and-responsibilities/sharing-accommodation-with-your-landlord/) .
