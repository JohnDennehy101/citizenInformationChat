##  What are rental scams?

Rental scams are when someone tries to take money from you when you are trying
to find somewhere to rent. For example, the person might claim they canâ€™t show
you accommodation they have advertised, then take your deposit and disappear.

When you are looking for a place to rent, you should be aware of rental scams
and how to avoid them. Before you make any payment or agreement with your
landlord you should always view the property in person and make sure you are
happy with the tenancy terms and conditions.
