###  What happens to my complaint once I make my complaint to the FSPO?

The FSPO will deal with the complaint either informally (using mediation) or
formally.

There is a [ standard complaint form ](https://www.fspo.ie/complaint-
form.aspx) that you must use to make your complaint with the FSPO. Information
on the steps involved is available in a [ 3-step guide on how to complain to
the FSPO ](https://www.fspo.ie/make-a-complaint/) . If your complaint is about
a joint account or joint policy, all owners must make the complaint.

You should include all relevant documents and correspondence (copies are
fine).

The FSPO will review the information submitted by both parties and adjudicate
on the matter.
