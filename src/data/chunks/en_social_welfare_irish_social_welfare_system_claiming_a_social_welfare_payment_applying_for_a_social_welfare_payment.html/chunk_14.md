####  **What does a Deciding Officer do?**

When the Department has all the information it needs, a Deciding Officer will
examine your claim and will either accept or reject your claim for the social
welfare payment you applied for. The Deciding Officer must apply the law as
set out in Social Welfare Acts, Statutory Instruments, and relevant Department
guidelines, circulars and other regulations when making a decision on your
claim. If your claim is approved, the Deciding Officer will determine the rate
of your payment.

A Deciding Officer must record their decision on your claim in writing.
Generally, if your application for a payment has been successful you will get
a letter stating this. If your application is rejected, the Deciding Officer
must give you a letter in writing stating your claim has been rejected and the
reasons for this decision.

If you have been awarded less than the maximum rate of payment, you must get a
letter stating the reasons for this.

It is useful to know the reason or reasons why a deciding officer rejected
your claim or awarded you less than the maximum rate of payment, especially if
[ you wish to appeal their decision
