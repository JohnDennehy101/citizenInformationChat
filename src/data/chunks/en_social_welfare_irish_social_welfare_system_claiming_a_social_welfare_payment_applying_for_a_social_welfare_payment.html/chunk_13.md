####  **What happens when I send my application?**

When you send your application form to the Department of Social Protection, it
will be assessed to make sure that it is correctly completed and that you have
sent all the required documents.

At this point, the Department may request more information from you or ask you
to attend a medical examination to find out if you qualify for the payment you
applied for. For example, if you apply for Disability Allowance you may be
asked to attend for a medical examination. If this is the case, the doctor's
report stating whether you meet the medical criteria is sent to the person at
the Department of Social Protection who is responsible for making a decision
on your claim.
