###  Limited company

If you set up your business as a limited company, you and your business are
seen as separate entities. In general, this means that if the company gets
into debt, the creditors only have a claim on the assets of the company (not
your personal assets).

To set up a limited company, you must register with the [ Companies
Registration Office (CRO) ](http://www.cro.ie/) . Your company must then
return reports and accounts to the CRO each year. Register your business name
and file your company returns online using the CROâ€™s [ CORE (Companies Online
Registration Environment) ](https://core.cro.ie/) .
