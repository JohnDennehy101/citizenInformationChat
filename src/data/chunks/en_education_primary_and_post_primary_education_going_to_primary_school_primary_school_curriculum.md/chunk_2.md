##  What is the school curriculum?

The curriculum sets out the subjects children study in school.

It sets out what your child is taught and how their learning is assessed in
each subject.

Ireland's primary and post-primary school curricula are set by the Minister
for Education who is advised by the [ National Council for Curriculum and
Assessment (NCCA) ](https://ncca.ie/en) .
