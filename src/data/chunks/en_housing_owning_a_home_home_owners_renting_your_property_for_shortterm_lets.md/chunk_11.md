##  What are my tax obligations when renting a short-term let?

You must pay tax on any income you make from renting accommodation to guests
on a short-term basis. This income must be declared to Revenue each year. You
can complete and submit your tax return form online using:

  * Revenue's [ myAccount Service ](https://www.ros.ie/myaccount-web/home.html) if you are a PAYE taxpayer (Form 12) 
  * Revenue [ Online Service (ROS) ](https://www.ros.ie) if you are self-employed or a PAYE taxpayer with other sources of income (Form 11) 

Alternatively, you can complete a hard-copy annual tax return and return it to
your local tax office.
