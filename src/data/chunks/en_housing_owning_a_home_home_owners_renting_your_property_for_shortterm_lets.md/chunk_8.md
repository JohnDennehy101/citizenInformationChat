###  Registering with the planning authority

In certain situations you will need to register with the planning authority in
order to get an exemption from the requirement for planning permission. This
applies if:

  * You rent a room in your principal private residence for short-term lets while you are also occupying it 
  * You are going to be away from your principle private residence and you want to let it out on a short-term basis, for less than 90 days in a calendar year 

See the ‘How to apply’ section below for information on what you need to do to
register with the planning authority.

For more information on these new regulations see the Department of Housing,
Local Government and Heritage's [ New Regulation of Short-Term Lettings FAQ’s
](http://rebuildingireland.ie/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/short-
