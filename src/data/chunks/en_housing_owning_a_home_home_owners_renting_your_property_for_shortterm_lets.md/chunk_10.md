##  What happens if I don't follow the regulations?

Under the [ Planning and Development Act 2000
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2000/act/30/enacted/en/print) planning
authorities can take legal action if a property does not have the required
permission, or where terms of the permission have not been met.

[ New legislation for short-term lets
](https://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2022/act/29/section/3/enacted/en/html#sec3)
will mean that property owners and websites that advertise short-term lets,
will both be fined if the properties being advertised do not have the correct
planning permission. However, this does not yet apply.
