###  Planned changes to rules about short-term lets

More [ legislation about short-term lets
](https://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2022/act/29/section/3/enacted/en/html#sec3)
was due to apply from 1 September 2022, but it has been delayed.

This planned legislation will mean that online platforms, such as Airbnb, will
not be able to advertise properties for short-term let if the properties are
not registered with Fáilte Ireland and the owners have confirmed they have the
correct planning permission, if it is needed.

However, this rule is not yet in effect. See the ‘What is the short-term
tourist letting register?’ section below for more information about the
planned system.
