##  What is the planned short-term tourist letting register?

A new online registration system for short-term lets is being developed and is
due to be launched later in 2024. Under the new system, you will have to
register your short-term let online with [ Fáilte Ireland
](https://www.failteireland.ie/) every year. This system is not yet in place.

**Who will have to register?**

You will have to register if you offer short-term accommodation for 21 nights
or less.

This applies to the following properties if they are let on a short-term
basis:

  * Bedrooms in your primary home 
  * Entire properties 
  * Multiple units at a single address or Eircode. For example, a camping resort, holiday village or apartment block. 

**How will I register?**

To register you will need to:

  * Provide your details 
  * Provide information about your property, including the Eircode 
  * Confirm you have planning permission to operate as a short-term let. It is intended that you will not need documentation to prove this. 
  * Pay a registration fee 

**Why do I need to register?**

Once you are registered you will get a short-term tourist letting registration
number. You will need this number to list your property on holiday booking
websites and in advertisements.

These booking platforms will only be able to list short-term let properties
with a valid Failte Ireland registration number.

Your short-term let property will also be listed on the short-term tourist
letting register on the Fáilte Ireland website.
