###  Written statement of contract end date **or event**

Your employer must give you written notice of the _objective condition_ of
your contract. You must get this as soon as possible.

The objective condition is the event or circumstances that determine the
contract end date.

It could be:

These rights are set out in the [ Protection of Employees (Fixed-Term Work)
