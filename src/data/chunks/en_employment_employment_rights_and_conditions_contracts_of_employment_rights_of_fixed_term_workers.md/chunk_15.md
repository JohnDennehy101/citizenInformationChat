###  Successive fixed-term contracts

You cannot be employed on a series of fixed-term contracts indefinitely.

You cannot be kept on successive fixed-term contracts for more than 4 years.
This does not include a single fixed-term contract. For example, you can get a
5-year fixed-term contract but you cannot get 5 one-year fixed-term contracts.

If your employer wants you to continue in the job, they must employ you under
an open-ended contract (also called a contract of _indefinite duration_ or
permanent contract – see ‘Introduction’).

**Void terms**

If your employer tries to limit the duration your fixed-term contract in a way
that breaks these rules, that part of the contract does not count. Instead the
contract is considered open-ended—a permanent one.

This creates a right to permanency even if the right is not claimed or
acknowledged by either party at the time. This entitlement can be used even
years after the contract term expires.
