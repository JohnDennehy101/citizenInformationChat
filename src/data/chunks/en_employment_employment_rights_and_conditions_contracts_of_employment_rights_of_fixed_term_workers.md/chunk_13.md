###  Maternity leave and fixed-term contracts

Fixed-term workers are entitled to full maternity leave. However, if your
fixed-term contract ends before the last day of maternity leave, the last day
of your contract counts as the last day of maternity leave.

This means that if the fixed-term contract ends during your maternity leave,
your contract of employment terminates on that date. This does not affect your
entitlement to the full 26 weeks of [ Maternity Benefit ](/en/social-
welfare/families-and-children/maternity-benefit/) .
