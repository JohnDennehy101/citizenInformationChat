##  Who is a fixed-term worker?

You are a fixed-term worker if your contract lasts until a certain condition
is met (known as an objective condition)

This condition could be:

  * Reaching a specified date 
  * Finishing a specific task 
  * The completion of a specific event 

Examples of fixed-term workers are:

  * A retail worker taken on for 3 months during peak season 
  * A specialist taken on for the duration of a project 
  * A worker taken on to cover maternity leave 

**Who is not a fixed-term worker?**

You are not a fixed-term worker if you:

  * Are a _temporary agency worker_ (where an agency facilitates your temporary placement in an organisation but you do not have an employment contract with the agency. Agency workers who are employed directly by an employment agency can be fixed-term workers) 
  * Are an apprentice or trainee 
  * Work in a publicly-funded employment scheme, for example Community Employment
