##  Rights of fixed-term workers

Generally, people employed on fixed-term contracts have the same rights as
other employees. There are also some extra legal protections for workers with
fixed-term contracts.

If you are a fixed-term worker, your employer:

  * Cannot treat you less favourably to your permanent co-workers. In other words, you must be treated **at least as well as** comparable permanent employees. 
  * Must be able to **objectively justify** any different treatment. 
  * Must allow you to join a pension scheme (except where your normal hours are less than 20% of the normal hours of a comparable permanent employee). 
  * Must help you get training to enhance your skills, career development and job mobility (where possible). 
  * Must tell you about any vacancies for permanent positions (can be done by a general announcement).
