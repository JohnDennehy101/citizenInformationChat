###  Probation and fixed-term contracts

If your fixed-term contract has a probationary period, the length of the
probationary period must be proportionate to the expected length of the
contract and the nature of the work.

You cannot be subject to a new probationary period if your fixed-term contract
is renewed.

These rules are set out in the [ European Union (Transparent and Predictable
Working Conditions) Regulations 2022
](https://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2022/si/686/made/en/print) , which
became law on 16 December 2022.
