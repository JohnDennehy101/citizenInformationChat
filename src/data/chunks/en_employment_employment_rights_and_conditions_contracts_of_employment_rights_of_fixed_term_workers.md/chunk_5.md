####  What is a specified-purpose contract?

A fixed-term contract can also be a specified-purpose and so may not end on a
specific date. Instead, the contract finishes at an agreed time when a
particular task is completed.

We use the term _fixed-term contract_ for convenience throughout this page. It
also includes specified-purpose contracts.
