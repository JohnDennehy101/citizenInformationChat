##  Adjudication

If mediation is not used or is not successful, your complaint or dispute is
referred to an _adjudication officer_ within the Workplace Relations
Commission. The adjudication officer will carry out an inquiry, including a
hearing, and make a legally binding decision. This hearing is usually held in
public, except in exceptional circumstances.

The adjudicatorâ€™s decisions will include one or more of the following:

  * Compensation 
  * An order for equal pay or equal treatment 
  * An order that somebody takes a specified action.
