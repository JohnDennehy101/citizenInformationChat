###  Increased Exemption

You can get an Increased Exemption of an additional â‚¬10,000 on top of the
Basic Exemption if you:

  * Haven't received a tax-free lump sum in the last 10 years, and 
  * Are not getting a lump sum pension payment now or in the future 

If you are in an [ occupational pension scheme ](/en/money-and-tax/personal-
finance/pensions/occupational-pensions/) , the Increased Exemption is reduced
by any tax-free lump sum from the pension scheme you may be entitled to
receive.
