The Basic Exemption is €10,160, plus €765 for each complete year of service.
(This does not include statutory redundancy which is tax free.)

The following can be counted towards a full year's service:

  * Time worked before and after a career break 
  * A period of job-sharing or part-time work 
  * For group companies, all work carried out in Ireland 

If you have taken a career break the length of the break cannot be counted.
