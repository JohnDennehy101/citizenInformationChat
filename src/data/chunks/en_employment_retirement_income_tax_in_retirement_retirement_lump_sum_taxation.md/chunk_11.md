##  How will my employer tax my lump sum?

Your employer must deduct tax from all your income. They may take account of
the basic exemption, that is the €10,160 plus €765 for each year of service.

Revenue may tell your employer about the correct amount to be treated as tax
free and the rate of tax to be applied to the rest.

If this does not happen or if it is incorrect and you have paid too much tax,
you can make a claim for an exemption through myEnquiries on [ Revenue’s
myAccount service ](https://www.ros.ie/myaccount-
web/sign_in.html?execution=e1s1) .

You must declare the fact that you have received such a lump sum on your
annual return of income to Revenue.
