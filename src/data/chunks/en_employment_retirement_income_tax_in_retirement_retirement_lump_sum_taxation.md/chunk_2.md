##  Introduction

There are various circumstances in which you may get compensation for loss of
employment.

The most common is where you are made [ redundant
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/employment/unemployment-and-
redundancy/redundancy/what-is-redundancy/) and you get the statutory
redundancy lump sum. In some cases, you may get a further lump sum negotiated
by you or your [ trade union ](/en/employment/employment-rights-and-
conditions/industrial-relations-and-trade-unions/trade-unions/) with the
employer.

When you retire you may be paid a lump sum by your employer.

If you had a [ fixed-term contract ](/en/employment/employment-rights-and-
conditions/contracts-of-employment/rights-of-fixed-term-workers/) and it is
ended early, you may get a lump sum in compensation.

Lump sum payments qualify for special tax treatment - they may be exempt from
tax or may qualify for some relief from tax.

This page is about the taxation of your redundancy or retirement lump sum. It
is not about the tax treatment of your [ pension scheme ](/en/money-and-
tax/personal-finance/pensions/) lump sum.
