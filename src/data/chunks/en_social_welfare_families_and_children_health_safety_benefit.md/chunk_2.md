##  What is Health and Safety Benefit?

Health and Safety Benefit is a weekly payment for employed women who are
pregnant or breastfeeding, and who are granted [ health and safety leave
](/en/employment/employment-rights-and-conditions/health-and-safety/health-
safety-work#l4ac79) by their employer.

You are granted health and safety leave from employment if your employer
cannot remove a risk to your health while you are pregnant, or breastfeeding,
or assign you alternative "risk-free" duties. The right to [ health and safety
leave ](/en/employment/employment-rights-and-conditions/health-and-
safety/health-safety-work/) from employment is set out under [ Section 18 of
the Maternity Protection Act 1994
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1994/act/34/section/18/enacted/en/html) .

To qualify for Health and Safety Benefit, you must meet certain criteria and
social insurance (PRSI) contribution conditions. Your employer pays your
normal wage for the first 21 days (3 weeks) of your health and safety leave
and the Department of Social Protection pays Health and Safety Benefit for the
remainder.

If you think you have been wrongly refused Health and Safety Benefit you can [
appeal this decision ](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/social-
welfare-appeals/) .

During health and safety leave from employment, you are still considered to be
in employment (this means, for example, that you continue to accumulate annual
leave entitlement). However you are not entitled to payment for public
holidays that occur while you are on health and safety leave.
