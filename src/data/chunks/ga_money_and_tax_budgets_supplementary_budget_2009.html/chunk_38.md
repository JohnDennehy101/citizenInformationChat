###  Back to Work Enterprise Allowance

A package of measures will be implemented to facilitate better access to the
Back to Enterprise Allowance Scheme (BTWEA):

  * The amount of time you can participate on the BTWEA will be reduced from 4 years to 2 years 
  * The qualifying period required for BTWEA will be reduced from 2 years to 12 months provided you have an underlying entitlement to Jobseeker's Allowance. 
  * If you have previously participated in the BTWEA scheme and exhausted your entitlement, you can participate a second time after period of at least 5 years has elapsed. 
  * If you qualify for Jobseeker's Benefit (with 104 contributions paid in the past 2 years) or have been awarded statutory redundancy you may get immediate access to a shorter BTWEA
