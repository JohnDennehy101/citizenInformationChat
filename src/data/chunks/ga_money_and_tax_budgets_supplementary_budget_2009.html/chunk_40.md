###  Early Childhood Care and Education Scheme

A free pre-school year of Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) for all
children between the ages of 3 years 3 months and 4 years 6 months is being
introduced. The provision will amount to 3 hours per day, 5 days a week over a
38-week year for children enrolled in playschools. Children enrolled in other
childcare services will receive 2 hours and 15 minutes per day over a 50-week
period. Around 70,000 children will benefit. All community and private pre-
school services will be invited to enter the scheme. A capitation grant will
be payable to service providers. (January 2010)
