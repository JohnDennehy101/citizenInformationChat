####  **Rent reviews for a new tenancy in an RPZ**

For a new tenancy in a Rent Pressure Zone, the landlord can review the rent
once every 12 months. The landlord must give the tenant the following
information, in writing, at the start of the tenancy:

  * The amount of rent that was last set for the property 
  * The date the rent was last set for the property 
  * A statement as to how the rent set for the property has been calculated, having regard to the Rent Pressure Zone calculator 

The rent being set should not be more than local market rents for similar
properties
