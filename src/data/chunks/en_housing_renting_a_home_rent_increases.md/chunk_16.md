##  If your landlord is raising the rent

Threshold, the national housing charity, publishes detailed advice on [ how to
deal with rent increases ](http://www.threshold.ie/advice/dealing-with-
problems-during-your-tenancy/how-to-deal-with-rent-increases/) . You can
contact Threshold for advice on your particular situation – see ‘Where to
apply’ below’.

If there is any dispute about the amount of rent being proposed, either side
can [ refer the dispute to the RTB ](https://www.rtb.ie/dispute-resolution) .
If you are claiming that the proposed rent is higher than the market rate, you
should provide evidence of rental rates for similar properties in the same
area.

If the landlord has given you a valid written notice of the rent increase, you
must contact the RTB with your dispute before the date that the new rent comes
into effect or within 28 days of getting the notice, whichever is later. There
is no time limit if the notice is not valid.

You must continue to pay your rent until the case has been determined by the
RTB.
