###  Calculating allowable rent increases

You can use [ the RTBâ€™s calculator ](https://www.rtb.ie/calculator/rpz) to
check if your property is in a Rent Pressure Zone and to work out if the rent
can be raised and, if so, by how much. You will need to enter your address or
[ Eircode ](/en/consumer/phone-internet-tv-and-postal-services/eircode/) , the
current rent and the date when the rent was last set.
