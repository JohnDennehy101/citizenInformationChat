##  Introduction

Primary schools are not required to have boards of management. Each school is
established by a ‘patron’ who can decide whether or not to have a board of
management. In practice, most primary schools have boards.

The [ Education Act 1998
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1998/en/act/pub/0051/index.html) sets out the
responsibilities of boards of management in primary schools.

The 4-year term of office for boards of management of all primary schools
started on the 1 December 2019 – see ‘Term of office of the board’ below.
