##  How the board of management operates

All boards of management must follow the governance manual set by the
Department of Education. The boards must follow the terms of the [ Governance
Manual for Primary Schools 2019-2023 (pdf) ](https://s3-eu-
west-1.amazonaws.com/govieassets/34186/31f98d651a6147ef91d781fa3805ccc7.pdf) .
The manual sets out the key activities of the Board.

Essentially, the board manages the school to provide all students with the
best possible education.

Among its responsibilities, the board:

  * Must draw up the school plan and ensure that it is acted on 
  * Appoint the principal, the teachers and other staff. 
  * Ensure that the school fulfils its functions as set out in the [ Education Act 1998 ](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1998/act/51/section/15/enacted/en/html#sec15)
  * Promote contact between the school, the parents and the community and must facilitate and give all reasonable help to a parents' association in its formation and its activities 
  * Have overall responsibility for the school's finances. It must ensure the school has comprehensive insurance cover, keeps proper accounts, which may be audited by the Department of Education and/or the Comptroller and Auditor General. Its annual accounts must be available to the patron and the school community. 
  * Ensure that child protection and welfare are considered in all of the school’s policies, practices and activities. The board must ensure that the [ Child Protection Procedures for Primary and Post Primary Schools ](https://www.gov.ie/en/policy-information/d7be05-child-protection/) are fully applied by the school. 
  * Ensure the school has a code of behaviour and an anti-bullying policy 
  * Comply with garda vetting requirements before employing, contracting or placing any person in contact with children or vulnerable persons
