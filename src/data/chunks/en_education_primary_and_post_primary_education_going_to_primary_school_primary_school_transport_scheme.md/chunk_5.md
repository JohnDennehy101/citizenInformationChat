###  Schools

The Department of Education decides what the nearest suitable school is. If a
child is attending a school that has more than one teacher and there is a one-
teacher school nearer the home, that fact will not usually disqualify the
child from using the school transport scheme.

Children attending multi-denominational schools or Gaelscoileanna (Irish-
speaking schools) are eligible if they meet the distance requirements to their
school. They are not disqualified because there is another national school
nearer to them. There are also special arrangements for Protestant children
attending Protestant schools and children living in remote areas.
