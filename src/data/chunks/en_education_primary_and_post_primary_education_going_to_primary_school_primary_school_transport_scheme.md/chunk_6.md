###  Pick-up points

The scheme is not a door-to-door service. Parents/guardians are responsible
for bringing their children to the nearest pick-up point to avail of the
service. Generally, routes are planned so pupils don't have to travel more
than 2.4 km to their nearest pick-up point.

If there is no school transport service available, you may be able to get a
grant towards the costs of private transport for a child who cannot get to
school without transport due to an illness or disability.
