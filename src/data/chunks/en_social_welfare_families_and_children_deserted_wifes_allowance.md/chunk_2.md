##  Introduction

Deserted Wife's Allowance is a means-tested payment made to women under 66
years without dependent children, who were deserted by their husband and who
do not qualify for [ Deserted Wife's Benefit ](/en/social-welfare/families-
and-children/deserted-wife-s-payments/) . Deserted Wife's Allowance has been
closed for new applications since 2 January 1997 when the [ One Parent Family
Payment ](/en/social-welfare/families-and-children/one-parent-family-payment/)
was introduced.

Some women continue to receive Deserted Wife's Allowance because they
qualified for the payment before 2 January 1997 and have continued to meet the
qualifying criteria.
