###  Registration of tenancies

The RTB maintains a [ national register of tenancies
](https://www.rtb.ie/check/index.html) . All private residential tenancies,
approved housing body tenancies and student-specific accommodation tenancies
must be registered with the RTB. Since 4 April 2022, landlords must [ register
their tenancies ](/en/housing/renting-a-home/landlords-rights-and-
responsibilities/registering-a-tenancy/) every year, within a month of the
date of when the tenancy began. Landlords who do not register their tenancies
can be fined up to €4,000 and may be imprisoned if convicted.
