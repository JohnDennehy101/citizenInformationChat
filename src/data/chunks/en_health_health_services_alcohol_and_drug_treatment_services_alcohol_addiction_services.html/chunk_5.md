###  Detoxification

Detoxification removes the physical craving for alcohol or drugs that is a
symptom of addiction. Detoxification can take place on an out-patient basis
under the supervision of a GP or on an in-patient basis, depending on your
assessed needs. Self-detoxification may carry risks and you should always get
advice from a professional.

Detoxification does not deal with the psychological issues related to
addiction, so further support is usually provided when detoxification is
completed. You can talk to your GP about a suitable detoxification programme
and treatment plan.
