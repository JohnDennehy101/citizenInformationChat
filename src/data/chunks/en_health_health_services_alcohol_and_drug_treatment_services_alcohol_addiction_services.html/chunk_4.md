###  Addiction counselling

Addiction counsellors can provide:

  * An assessment 
  * Brief intervention 
  * Counselling (such as cognitive behavioural therapy) 
  * Information 
  * Onward referral to treatment services 

Counselling can be provided on an individual basis or through group
counselling.

As well as addiction counselling, community care services may provide other
related courses. The issues that addiction presents in relationships may be
addressed in family therapy or couples therapy or in support groups for other
people who have been affected.
