your own personal requirements. Most people are treated in the community in
non-residential settings. Some of the treatment options available include:

  * Detoxification 
  * Residential programmes 
  * Group support 

If you have mental health needs you can access your local [ mental health

Depending on your treatment needs, you may be referred back to your GP for
ongoing care.
