###  What is discrimination?

Discrimination is defined as less favourable treatment. A person is said to be
discriminated against if they are treated less favourably than another is, has
been or would be treated in a comparable situation on any of the grounds
mentioned above. To establish direct discrimination, a direct comparison must
be made, for example, in the case of disability discrimination the comparison
must be between a person who has a disability and another who has not, or
between persons with different disabilities.

Indirect discrimination occurs when practices or policies that do not appear
to discriminate against one group more than another actually have a
discriminatory impact. It can also happen where a requirement that may appear
non-discriminatory.
