##  Human rights issues

The Commission can assist you to further [ human rights issues
](http://www.ihrec.ie/your-rights/what-are-human-rights.html) by assisting you
with legal proceedings.

You must have made reasonable efforts to get legal assistance elsewhere, for
example, [ civil legal aid ](/en/justice/legal-aid-and-advice/civil-legal-
advice-and-legal-aid/) or [ criminal legal aid ](/en/justice/legal-aid-and-
advice/criminal-legal-aid/)

The Commission is not an adjudicator body in respect of complaints of human
rights violations in Ireland. It cannot offer remedies or compensation in
cases where human rights have been violated. It cannot overturn court, or
tribunal decisions, or require government departments to give entitlements to
people who may feel they have an entitlement.

Contact the Commission for more information about how requests for legal
assistance are assessed.
