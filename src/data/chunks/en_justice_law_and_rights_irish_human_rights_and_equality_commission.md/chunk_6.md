##  How to apply

Complaints under the Employment Equality Acts 1998-2015 must be brought within
6 months of the last act of discrimination. However, this period can be
extended to 12 months if you have a valid reason for the delay. You can make a
complaint to the [ Workplace Relations Commission
](/en/employment/enforcement-and-redress/workplace-relations-commission/)
using the online complaint form on [ workplacerelations.ie
](https://www.workplacerelations.ie/en/Complaints_Disputes/Refer_a_Dispute_Make_a_Complaint/)
.

To make a complaint under the Equal Status Acts 2000-2015 you must first
notify the person or organisation you are making the complaint against within
2 months of the last act of discrimination. Again, an extension can be
granted. If you are not satisfied with the service provider's response, or if
they have made no response within 1 month from the date you notified them, you
can bring a complaint to the Workplace Relations Commission within 6 months of
the last act of discrimination.

discrimination ](/en/employment/enforcement-and-redress/disputes-about-
equality-and-discrimination/) .
