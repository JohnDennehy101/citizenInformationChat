###  Diet supplement

[ The diet supplement was discontinued for **new applicants** from 1 February
2014. ](https://www.gov.ie/en/service/1d4b07-dietary-supplement/)

However, people who were getting Diet Supplement before 1 February 2014 can
continue to keep the payment (for as long as they continue to be entitled to
the payment).

You are entitled to retain the diet supplement for a _prescribed diet,_ if
you:

  * Have a specified medical condition 
  * Meet the conditions for Supplementary Welfare Allowance (SWA) and 
  * Pass a means test 

To get a diet supplement, a hospital consultant or a hospital registrar must
certify:

  * That you or your [ adult dependant ](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/claiming-a-social-welfare-payment/claiming-an-increase-in-your-social-welfare-payment-for-an-adult-dependant/) or [ child dependant ](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/claiming-a-social-welfare-payment/claiming-and-increase-in-your-payment-for-a-child-dependant/) has been prescribed a diet because of a specified medical condition 
  * The type of diet prescribed 
  * How long you will need the prescribed diet. 

A **gluten-free diet** for an adult or a child aged 18 to 22 may be prescribed
by your family doctor (GP).

In the case of diet supplements, for example, for people with cystic fibrosis,
the [ long-term illness scheme ](/en/health/drugs-and-medicines/long-term-
illness-scheme/) book may be accepted as verification that such a diet has
been prescribed. The length of time for which the diet is being prescribed and
the type of diet must be stated.
