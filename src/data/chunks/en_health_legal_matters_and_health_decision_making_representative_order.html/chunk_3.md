##  What can a decision-making representative do?

Your decision-making representative can only make decisions that the court has
set out in the order. For example, the decision-making representative can only
manage your finances if that is what the court has written down in the order
for them to do.

The court will list all of the decisions that the decision-making
representative can make. This may include decisions about property and money
matters, as well as decisions about personal welfare.

When making a decision for you, your decision-making representative must:

  * Make every effort to find out your past and present wishes about this specific decision, for example, getting the views of your friends, family and trusted advisors 
  * Help you to be involved in the decision-making as much as possible 

The court can choose different persons to act as decision-making
representatives for different types of decisions. For example they may
consider experience that a person may have to manage your financial affairs
and another representative to manage your personal welfare and property.

Decision-making representatives that are chosen by the Decision Support
Service from the panel of trained experts are paid for their work. This
payment may be taken from your estate.

The court will review your capacity (ability to make decisions) and the basis
for any decision-making representative regularly. If your capacity changes,
the decisions covered by the decision-making representation order may also
change.

representatives ](https://decisionsupportservice.ie/resources/codes-
