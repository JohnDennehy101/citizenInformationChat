##  Ending or changing a decision-making representation order

A decision-making representation order will end if:

  * The court decides to end the order after an application by you, your decision-making representative or any other person with a genuine interest in your welfare. 
  * The court decides that you have regained capacity. 
  * Your decision-making representative is not willing or able to continue in their role and the court makes an order. 

A decision-making representation order will also end if the time that the
decision-making representation order covers has passed and it has not been
renewed.
