##  Introduction

The Circuit Court can appoint a decision-making representative to act on your
behalf and make certain decisions for you. The decisions they can make on your
behalf are set out in the decision-making representation order.

The court will usually choose someone you know and trust to be your decision-
making representative. If this is not possible, or if the decisions to be made
are complex, the court can choose someone suitable from a panel of trained
experts prepared by the [ Decision Support Service
](https://decisionsupportservice.ie/) .

If the matter is urgent, the court may make the decision or decisions for you
under a decision-making order.

Decision-making representation orders are one of the [ new types of decision
supports ](/en/health/legal-matters-and-health/assisted-decision-making-act/)
that are in place since 26 April 2023. Before this date, if a person could not
make decisions because they lacked capacity, and they had not appointed an [
enduring power of attorney ](/en/death/before-a-death/power-of-attorney/) ,
the person may have become a [ ward of court ](/en/health/legal-matters-and-
health/wards-of-court/) .
