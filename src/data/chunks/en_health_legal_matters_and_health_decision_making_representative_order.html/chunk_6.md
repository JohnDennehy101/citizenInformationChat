##  What happens during a decision-making representation order?

The court will regularly check that the arrangement is working the way it
should.

The Decision Support Service will also monitor decisions made by your
decision-making representative. Your decision-making representative must
submit a written report to the Decision Support Service every year or at
shorter intervals if the court requires them to do so. Each report must
include details of financial matters, costs and expenses related to the
decisions included in the order.

If their decisions relate to your property and affairs, the decision-making
representative must submit a list of your assets, liabilities, income and
expenses so that the Decision Support Service can monitor these.
