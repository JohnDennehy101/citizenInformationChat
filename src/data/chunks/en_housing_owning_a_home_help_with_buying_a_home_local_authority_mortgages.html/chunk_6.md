##  Do I qualify for the Local Authority Home Loan?

The Local Authority Home Loan is available to first-time buyers and ‘fresh
start’ applicants. Fresh start applicants include:

  * People who are divorced, separated, or whose relationship has ended and who have no financial interest in the family home 
  * People who have gone through personal insolvency or bankruptcy 

**Note:** The Local Authority Home Loan cannot be used by fresh start
applicants to buy their former partner’s share of their family home.

To qualify for a Local Authority Home Loan you must:

  * Be a first-time buyer or a 'fresh start' applicant, see above. 
  * Be aged between 18 and 70. 
  * Provide evidence of insufficient offers of finance from two regulated financial providers, for example, a bank or building society. 
  * Have a gross annual income of less than €70,000 for single applicants and €85,000 for joint applicants. These new increased limits came in on 1 March 2023 and apply nationwide. 
  * Have a satisfactory credit record (a Central Credit Register enquiry will be made to check your credit record.) 
  * Have a deposit of at least 10% of the property’s market price or purchase price, whichever is less. If you are eligible for the [ Help to Buy Scheme ](/en/housing/owning-a-home/help-with-buying-a-home/help-to-buy-scheme/) , you can use this towards your deposit. If you are getting the loan to buy your local authority home under a Tenant Purchase Scheme, you do not need a deposit. 
  * Have a legal right to live and work in Ireland. 
  * Occupy the property as your normal place of residence. 

In addition, you must have been in continuous employment or self-employment
for a minimum of 2 years, if you are the primary applicant. Continuous
employment does not have to be permanent, full-time or even with the same
employer. However, there should not be a break of more than 4 weeks between
your jobs and you will not qualify if you have lots of casual jobs.

In general, secondary applicants must have been in continuous employment for a
minimum of 1 year. However, secondary applicants on the following long-term
social welfare payments may be considered:

  * State Pension (Contributory) 
  * State Pension (Non-Contributory) 
  * Widow's, Widower's or Surviving Civil Partner's pensions, 
  * Blind Pension 
  * Invalidity Pension 

**Note:** The requirement for applicants’ employment to be continuous was
relaxed during COVID-19. This flexibility applies if applicants’ have periods
of unemployment due to COVID-19 and meet other criteria. For more information
