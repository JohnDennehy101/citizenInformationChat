###  Additional supporting documents

If you are renting, self-employed, getting a social welfare payment or
applying as a 'fresh start' applicant, you may also need other supporting
documents when you are applying.

If you are a tenant:

  * Renting private rented accommodation, you need evidence of 12 months of rent payments before applying 
  * Renting directly from the local authority, or under the [ Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) scheme ](/en/housing/renting-a-home/help-with-renting/housing-assistance-payment/) or [ Rental Accommodation Scheme (RAS) ](/en/housing/local-authority-and-social-housing/rental-accommodation-scheme/) , you need a letter from the Rent Assessment Section of your local authority confirming that your rent assessment is up to date and the account has been clear for 6 months before applying 

If you are  self-employed  you also need:

  * An accountantâ€™s report or your audited accounts for the previous 2 years 
  * A letter from an accountant confirming that your personal and business taxes are up-to-date and in order 
  * A tax return summary (Form 11) for the previous 2 tax years 
  * A current tax balancing statement 
  * A current preliminary revenue tax payment receipt 

If you are getting jobseeker or other social welfare payments you need:

  * Appendix 2 of the application form completed by the Department of Social Protection (this includes a statement of the total benefits you received in the previous tax year) 

If you are applying as a 'fresh start' applicant you may need additional
documents to show that you qualify for the loan even though you may not be a
first-time buyer. The documentation you need depends on if you are applying as
a fresh start applicant because your relationship has ended, or because you
have exited insolvency or bankruptcy proceedings.

  * If you are applying because your relationship has ended, you will need proof of this. If you are separated or divorced you will need proof of the divorce or separation, as well as evidence that you have no financial interest in the family home and details of any maintenance arrangement. If your relationship has ended but there is no divorce or separation agreement, you will need a sworn statement. This should state that there is no formal separation agreement, you have no financial interest in the family home, there are no court proceedings pending under family law legislation, and details about any maintenance arrangements. 
  * If you are applying after insolvency or bankruptcy, you will need proof that any property you previously purchased or built has been sold, or given up as part of a personal insolvency, bankruptcy arrangement, or other legal insolvency process.
