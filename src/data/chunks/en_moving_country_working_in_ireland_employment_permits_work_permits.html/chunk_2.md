##  Introduction

If you are from a country that is outside the European Economic Area (the EU,
plus Norway, Iceland and Lichtenstein), the UK or Switzerland, you need
permission to work in Ireland. In most cases, this means you have to apply for
an employment permit.

The General Employment Permit allows you to work in occupations where there is
a labour shortage in Ireland. You can get the permit to work in any job that
is not on the [ Ineligible List of Occupations for Employment Permits
](https://enterprise.gov.ie/en/What-We-Do/Workplace-and-Skills/Employment-
Permits/Employment-Permit-Eligibility/Ineligible-Categories-of-Employment/) ,
and subject to the other qualifying criteria.

You apply for it before you come to Ireland in most cases. You may also have
to [ apply for a visa ](/en/moving-country/visas-for-ireland/visa-
requirements-for-entering-ireland/) to come to Ireland.

Once you have arrived in Ireland, you have to [ register and get an Irish
Residence Permit ](/en/moving-country/moving-to-ireland/rights-of-residence-
in-ireland/registration-of-non-eea-nationals-in-ireland/) .

There are other [ types of employment permit ](/en/moving-country/working-in-
ireland/employment-permits/overview-employment-permits/) issued by DETE.

The employment permits scheme is governed by the [ Employment Permits Acts
](http://www.lawreform.ie/_fileupload/RevisedActs/WithAnnotations/HTML/en_act_2006_0016.htm)
. On 2 September 2024, the Employment Permits Act 2024 comes into effect and
introduces some changes to employment permits law in Ireland.
