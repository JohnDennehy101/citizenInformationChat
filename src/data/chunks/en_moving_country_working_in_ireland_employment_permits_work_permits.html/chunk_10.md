##  The ‘50:50’ rule

DETE does not issue employment permits for jobs in businesses where at the
time of application more than 50% of workers are from outside the EEA. This is
called the ‘50:50’ rule.

There are some exceptions:

  * Where the company is new (registered with Revenue as an employer in the past 2 years) and has a letter of support from Enterprise Ireland or IDA Ireland. This only applies to companies that are clients of Enterprise Ireland or IDA Ireland. 
  * Employment permits that were granted before 1 October 2014. 
  * Where you will be the only employee of the company. 

From 2 September 2024, the waiver to the 50:50 criteria for employers who have
no employees at time of application has been revised. This means you, as the
employer, are no longer restricted to the one employee permit holder. The
50:50 rule will be triggered when a second application is made for an
employment permit for the same employer.

In the case of a contract for service agreement, the 50:50 criteria can be
satisfied by the contractor, subcontractor, or relevant person, in recognition
of the fact that a contractor or subcontractor from outside the EEA may not
have at least 50 percent EEA workers in its workforce.
