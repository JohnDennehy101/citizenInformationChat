##  Who is eligible for a General Employment Permit?

You or your employer must apply for the employment permit before you come to
Ireland.

If you already live in Ireland and have a valid Irish Residence Permit (IRP)
with Stamp 1, 1G, 2, 2A or 3 permission, you can apply for the permit without
leaving Ireland. Stamp 4 holders do not need an employment permit to work. If
your Stamp 4 permission is coming to an end and you cannot renew it, you can
apply for an employment permit.

You or your employer can apply for a General Employment Permit if you are
offered a job that satisfies the conditions below:

  * Pays at least â‚¬34,000 per year (from 17 January 2024) -see exceptions below 
  * Is not on the [ list of ineligible occupations ](https://enterprise.gov.ie/en/what-we-do/workplace-and-skills/employment-permits/employment-permit-eligibility/ineligible-categories-of-employment/)
  * A Labour Market Needs Test has been carried out by the employer 
  * At least half the workers are from the EEA (this is called the 50/50 rule)
