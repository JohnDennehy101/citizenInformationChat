##  Immigration and registration

If your application is successful and you live outside of Ireland, you still
have to [ apply for a visa to enter Ireland ](/en/moving-country/visas-for-
ireland/visa-requirements-for-entering-ireland/) if you are from a country
whose citizens need a visa to enter Ireland. You must present your employment
permit to the immigration officer in the airport or port of entry to Ireland.

You must [ register with your local registration office ](/en/moving-
country/moving-to-ireland/rights-of-residence-in-ireland/registration-of-non-
eea-nationals-in-ireland/) in the area where you intend to live when you
arrive in Ireland. Once you are registered, you will get an Irish Residence
Permit (IRP).

If you are already living in Ireland on another immigration permission, you
must go to your local registration office to change your registration
permission.
