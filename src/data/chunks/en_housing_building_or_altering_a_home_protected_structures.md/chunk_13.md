##  How does a structure become a protected structure?

A structure must be listed on the planning authorityâ€™s Record of Protected
Structures (RPS) to qualify for protected status. Planning authorities must
include every structure that they think is of special interest in their area
on the RPS.

The planning authority can add and delete structures from its RPS when
reviewing its development plan or at any other time. There are 3 steps before
a structure can be added to the RPS:

  * Identifying possible protected structures 
  * Assessing if a structure is of special interest 
  * Notifying people about the proposed protected structure
