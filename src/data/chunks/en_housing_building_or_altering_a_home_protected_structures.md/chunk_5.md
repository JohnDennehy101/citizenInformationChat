####  **How much is it?**

The Historic Structures Fund has 3 funding streams:

**Stream** |  **What does it cover?** |  **How much is it worth?**  
---|---|---  
1  |  Essential repairs and smaller capital works to refurbish and conserve heritage structures.  Note: Local authorities can also apply for funding for the conservation of historic shop fronts and historic Irish language shop fronts under Stream 1.  |  €15,000 to €50,000   
2  |  Larger enhancement, refurbishment or reuse projects involving heritage structures.  |  €50,000 to €200,000   
Vernacular Structures Stream  |  Conserving vernacular structures that are not already protected. Vernacular structures are informal buildings or built features that were made by everyday people, but now have cultural significance, for example, buildings made using thatching, mud-walling or wattle-working.  |  €5,000 to €10,000
