###  **What happens if I ignore notices about a protected structure?**

If you ignore a notice from the planning authority about preventing a
structure from becoming endangered, the planning authority can take
enforcement action. The planning authority can carry out the work itself and
recover the costs of the work from you.

In exceptional cases, the planning authority may buy the protected structure
from the owner, either by [ compulsory purchase
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/housing/losing-your-home-and-
homelessness/compulsory-purchase-of-property/) or by agreement. This would
only be done if the planning authority considered it the only way to save a
protected structure.

Under the Planning and Development Act 2000, there are penalties for owners or
occupiers of protected structures who endanger the structure or who fail to
carry out work that has been ordered by the planning authority. If they are
found guilty, they could be liable for fines of up to â‚¬12.7 million and/or a
term of imprisonment of up to 2 years.
