###  **What happens if my protected structure is endangered?**

If a protected structure is endangered, the planning authority can serve a
notice on you, requiring you to carry out any work that it considers necessary
to protect the structure. The work must be done within 8 weeks of the date of
the notice.

The planning authority can also service a notice requiring the ‘restoration of
character’ of the protected structure. This could include removing, changing
or replacing any parts of the structure specified in the notice.

If you don’t agree with the notices or can’t comply with them, you can make
written representations to the planning authority about the terms of the
notices. You can request more time or financial help to comply with them. In
many cases, you may qualify for a conservation grant to help you comply.

The planning authority will take these representations into account when
making their final decision. If you are not satisfied with the response, you
can appeal against these notices to the [ District Court
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/justice/courts-system/district-court/)
. You must do this within 2 weeks of your last response from the planning
authority.
