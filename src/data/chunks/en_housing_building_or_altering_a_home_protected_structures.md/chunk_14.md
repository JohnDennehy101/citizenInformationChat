###  **Identifying possible protected structures**

There are a number of ways a planning authority can identify structures for
protection:

  * A planning authority can carry out a survey of its area to determine if there are structures that should be added to the RPS. 
  * The [ National Inventory of Architectural Heritage (NIAH) ](http://www.buildingsofireland.ie/) compiles records of Ireland's architectural heritage. It provides planning authorities with details of surveys of their area. NIAH surveys may be used by the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage to make recommendations on structures to be added to the RPS. It is up to the planning authority to decide if any of the structures recommended should be included in the RPS. 
  * The Minister can also make recommendations to a planning authority to include individual structures in the RPS. 
  * Anyone can write to a planning authority to recommend a structure for protection, but the decision to include it in the RPS can only be made by the elected members of the planning authority.
