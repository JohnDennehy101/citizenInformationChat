authorities manage it. You apply to your local authority for the grant by the
deadline, which is usually the end of January each year.

In March, the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage publishes

that get funding for the year.

If you miss the deadline for applying, you will need to wait till next year.

to historic structures may be available outside the annual grant cycle. For

been severely damaged by a storm. These applications will be considered by the
Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage on a case-by-case basis.
