###  **Notifying people about proposed protected structures**

If a planning authority is considering including a structure on the RPS, it
must:

  * Notify the owner and occupier that the structure is a ‘proposed protected structure’. (The structure will have the same protection as a structure already on the RPS while you are waiting the final decision of the planning authority.) 
  * Inform the Minister of the proposed addition, along with a [ number of organisations ](https://assets.gov.ie/121548/a045e28d-c0fe-430a-a35f-d35a31df72c1.pdf) , including the [ Heritage Council ](http://www.heritagecouncil.ie/) , the [ Arts Council ](http://www.artscouncil.ie/) , [ Fáilte Ireland ](http://www.failteireland.ie/) and [ An Taisce ](http://www.antaisce.org/) . 
  * Display details of proposed additions to the RPS in public for at least 6 weeks. During this time anyone can comment on the proposal. These comments will be taken into account when the planning authority decides if the structure should become a protected structure. 

The decision to list a structure in the RPS must be made within 12 weeks of
the end of the display period. The planning authority must notify the owner
and occupier of the structure of their decision within 2 weeks.
