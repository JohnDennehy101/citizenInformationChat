##  What are my responsibilities if I own or live in a protected structure?

If you own or live in a protected structure you are legally required to make
sure that the structure does not become endangered through neglect, decay,
damage or harm. If a structure is kept in habitable condition and has regular
maintenance it should not become endangered. Regular maintenance might include
cleaning out gutters, repairing missing slates, or repainting external
timberwork.
