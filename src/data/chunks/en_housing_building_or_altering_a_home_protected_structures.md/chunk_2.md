##  What is a protected structure?

A protected structure is a structure that a planning authority thinks is of
special interest from an architectural, historical, archaeological, artistic,
cultural, scientific, social or technical point of view.

If a planning authority thinks a structure meets these criteria, the structure
must be listed on the planning authorityâ€™s Record of Protected Structures
(RPS). All structures listed on the RPS qualify for [ protected status
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2000/en/act/pub/0030/sec0051.html#partiv) .
Each planning authority must keep a RPS as part of its [ development plan
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/housing/planning-
permission/development-plans/) .

When a structure is included in the RPS it means that:

  * Its importance is recognised 
  * It is legally protected from harm 
  * All future changes to the structure are controlled and managed through the development control process. For example, planning permission or by issuing a declaration under [ Section 57 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 ](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2000/en/act/pub/0030/sec0057.html)

If a structure is included in the RPS, the protection covers:

  * The inside of the structure 
  * The land in its curtilage. Curtilage means the land and outbuildings immediately surrounding a structure which is or was used for the purposes of the structure 
  * Any other structures on that land and their interiors 
  * All fixtures and features forming part of the interior and exterior of the protected structure or any structure on the grounds attached to it
