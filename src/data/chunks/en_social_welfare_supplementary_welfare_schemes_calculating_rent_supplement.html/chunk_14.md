###  **Carer’s disregard**

If you are getting a carer's payment, the amount of [ Carer's Allowance
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/carers/carers-
allowance/) or [ Carer’s Benefit
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/carers/carers-benefit/)
in payment above the appropriate SWA rate for your situation (either the adult
dependant rate for a couple or the personal rate for a single person) is not
taken into account.

To calculate your carer’s disregard, you subtract the relevant rate of SWA
(either €154 or €230) from the actual rate of Carer’s Allowance or Benefit you
are getting (not including any Increases for Qualified Children).

Your ‘income in excess of the SWA rate’ is your contribution to your rent from
your means (in addition to your minimum household contribution). If you have
no income in excess of the SWA rate, Step 3 does not apply to you.
