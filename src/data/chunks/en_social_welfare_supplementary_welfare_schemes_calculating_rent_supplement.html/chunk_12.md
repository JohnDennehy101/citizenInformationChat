###  **Over-65 disregard**

If you are aged 65 or over (or where one of a couple is of aged 65 or over)
and have a combined household income greater than the rate of SWA appropriate
to your household circumstances, you are allowed a disregard.

This disregard is equal to the difference between the maximum rate of [ State
Pension (Contributory) ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-
welfare/older-and-retired-people/state-pension-contributory/) appropriate to
your circumstances, and the rate of SWA appropriate to your circumstances
(even if you are not getting a pension).

This means that a person whose only income is a State pension will not pay
more than the minimum household contribution towards their rent.
