##  Information about your job

The [ Terms of Employment (Information) Acts 1994â€“2014
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1994/en/act/pub/0005/index.html) says
employers must give employees certain information about their employment, such
as a contract of employment, a job description, rate of pay and hours of work.

The [ General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) 2018 ](/en/government-in-
ireland/data-protection/overview-of-general-data-protection-regulation/) gives
you much more control over your personal data. It also sets out the
responsibilities of companies who control and process your data.

The [ Employment (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2018
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2018/act/38/enacted/en/html) bans zero-
hour contracts in most situations. It also provides for minimum payments and
banded hours. The Act states that employers must give employees information on
the core terms of employment within 5 days of starting work. The rules were
updated by the [ European Union (Transparent and Predictable Working
Conditions) Regulations 2022
](https://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2022/si/686/made/en/print) .
