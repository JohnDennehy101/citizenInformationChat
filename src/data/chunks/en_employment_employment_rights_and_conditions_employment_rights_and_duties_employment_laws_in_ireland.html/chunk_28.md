###  Mediation

Often, disputes between employers and employees can be resolved using [
workplace mediation ](/en/employment/enforcement-and-redress/workplace-
mediation/) .

Mediation is a confidential process, which aims to resolve workplace disputes
and disagreements, particularly between individuals or small groups. A
mediator will work with employees and employers to find a mutually agreed
solution to the problem.

The [ Mediation Act 2017
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2017/act/27/enacted/en/print.html) allows
employees to use mediation for certain civil claims, for example, personal
injuries actions. This legislation does not apply to employment disputes
brought to the WRC, including disputes being dealt with by mediation officers
of the WRC.
