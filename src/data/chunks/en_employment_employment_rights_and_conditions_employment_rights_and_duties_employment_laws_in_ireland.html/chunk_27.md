##  Complaints about a breach of employment rights

The [ Workplace Relations Act 2015
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2015/act/16/enacted/en/html) established
the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC), which replaced the Labour Relations
Commission, Rights Commissioner Service, Equality Tribunal, and National
Employment Rights Authority.

You can refer complaints, disputes or grievances regarding breaches of
employment rights under certain legislation to the Workplace Relations
Commission using their [ online complaint form
](https://www.workplacerelations.ie/en/complaints_disputes/making_a_complaint/)
. Before you apply to the WRC, you must tell your employer of your intention
to contact the Workplace Relations Commission. You should try to resolve the
matter with your employer directly before referring a complaint to the WRC.

A [ Workplace Relations Commission adjudicator ](/en/employment/enforcement-
and-redress/adjudication-employment-rights-disputes-and-complaints/) will
listen to both sides before completing an investigation of the complaint and
issuing a decision.
