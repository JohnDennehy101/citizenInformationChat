##  Redundancy and dismissals

The [ Redundancy Payments Acts 1967â€“2014
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1967/act/21/enacted/en/html) gives a
minimum entitlement to a redundancy payment for employees who have a set
period of service. Not all employees are entitled to the statutory redundancy
payment, even where there is a redundancy situation.

The [ Protection of Employment (Exceptional Collective Redundancies and
Related Matters) Act 2007
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2007/en/act/pub/0027/index.html) set up a
redundancy panel to consider certain proposed collective redundancies. The Act
also removed the upper age limit for entitlement to redundancy payments.
