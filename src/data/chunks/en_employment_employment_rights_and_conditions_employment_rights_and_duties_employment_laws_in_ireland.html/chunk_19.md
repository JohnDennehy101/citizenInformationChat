###  Fixed term employees

The [ Protection of Employees (Fixed Term Work) Act 2003
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2003/en/act/pub/0029/index.html) protects [
fixed-term employees ](/en/employment/types-of-employment/types-of-
employment#lceb2f) by ensuring they cannot be treated less favourably than
comparable permanent workers, and that employers cannot continually renew [
fixed term contracts ](/en/employment/employment-rights-and-
conditions/contracts-of-employment/rights-of-fixed-term-workers/) . Under the
Act, employees can only work on one or more fixed term contracts for a
continuous period of 4 years. After this, the employee is considered to have a
contract of indefinite duration (e.g. a permanent contract).
