**An Post BillPay Card**

Your relative or friend in prison must nominate you as a person who can
receive [ An Post BillPay card (pdf) ](https://www.irishprisons.ie/wp-
content/uploads/documents_pdf/Using-An-Post-BillPay-Cards.pdf) from the Irish
Prison Service.

Once you receive the BillPay Card, you can call in to any post office in
Ireland, hand the BillPay Card in at the counter and lodge funds in cash or by
debit card.

You will be given a receipt, which you should keep as proof of payment. The
maximum transaction is €200. The card may be shared by family members to send
funds to the person in custody.

You can also transfer funds from your bank account to that of a friend or
relative in prison [ by bank transfer (pdf) ](https://www.irishprisons.ie/wp-

You can do this through your bank’s website or app, or by calling into your
bank. The maximum transaction is €200 and any payment over this amount will be
returned.
