####  Examination of letters

The governor can open, examine and confiscate:

  * A letter being sent by a prisoner if its contents are suspected of undermining the safety and welfare of others (this does not apply to a letter to a professional recipient, such as a legal advisor or court official) 
  * A letter that has been sent to a prisoner if there are grounds to believe that its contents may compromise secure custody in prison, or would facilitate or hamper an investigation into a criminal offence
