##  Rights and entitlements of prisoners

The visitation entitlements of prisoners vary based on their custodial status.

The Irish Prison Service also operates an Incentivised Regimes Policy,
rewarding prisoners for good behaviour with increased visitation and other
entitlements. You can read more about the [ Incentivised Regimes Policy (pdf)

You can also learn more about prisonersâ€™ rights and entitlements in our page
