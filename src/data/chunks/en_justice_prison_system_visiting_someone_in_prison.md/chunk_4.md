##  How to arrange a visit

A minimum of 48 hours’ notice must be given when requesting a visit to any
prison in Ireland.

Visits can be requested [ online ](https://www.irishprisons.ie/requesting-a-
physical-visit/) , over the phone or, in some cases, in person at the
visitors’ centre. You can read the Irish Prison Service’s [ Family Information
Booklet for information (pdf) ](https://www.irishprisons.ie/wp-
content/uploads/documents_pdf/Family-Information-Booklet-September-2020.pdf)
about how visits work.

When submitting an online request for a visit, you must provide:

  * The name and PRIS number of the prisoner you wish to visit, and whether you wish to visit in person or online 
  * Your name, date of birth, address, email and telephone number 
  * Details of any extra visitors coming with you (if any) 
  * Up to 2 proposed visit times and dates 
  * The number of children you will bring (if any) 

A visit is not confirmed until a formal email is received confirming the date
and time of the intended visit from the prison. This should be printed off and
brought with you to the prison when visiting.
