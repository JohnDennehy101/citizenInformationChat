###  Children visiting a prison

In most cases, anyone under the age of 18 who is visiting a prison must be
accompanied by an adult.

Due to prison security measures and the regulated nature of visits, it can
often be a stressful experience for a child to visit somebody in prison. It
can be beneficial, therefore, to prepare a child on what to expect when
visiting a prison.
