##  Income from abroad

Income you get from abroad is generally taxable in Ireland if you are resident
in Ireland.

If you are living abroad and you receive your pension from Ireland, it may or
may not be taxable under PAYE. If there is a Double Taxation Agreement, you
may be exempted from Irish tax (but usually will be liable in the other
country). If you are exempt from Irish tax, [ Revenue
](http://www.revenue.ie/) may tell your pension provider (for example, your
former employer or the pension fund) not to deduct income tax under PAYE. If
Revenue do not do this, then PAYE is deducted in the usual way.

If you are getting a foreign pension that would be exempt from tax if you were
resident in the country paying it, you may also be exempt from paying tax on
it in Ireland.
