###  Double Taxation Agreements

Double Taxation Agreements generally make a distinction between pensions paid
by governments to former employees and pensions that are paid by private
employers. However, not all agreements make this distinction and they also
vary in other ways so you will need to check the agreement to see how it may
affect you.

Most Double Taxation Agreements provide that pensions for non-governmental
employees are taxed in the country of residence. So, if you are living in
Ireland and getting an occupational pension from another country, you should
generally pay Irish tax on it.

The opposite is the case for pensions for former government employees â€“
generally they are taxable only in the country where they are paid. So, if you
are a former employee of the government of the United States of America and
are now living in Ireland, you pay tax on your occupational pension only in
the USA.
