##  Social welfare pensions

Social welfare pensions paid by the Department of Social Protection are liable
to income tax. They are not liable to USC or PRSI.

Income tax is not deducted from your social welfare pension when it is paid to
you. How you pay the tax depends on whether you are self-employed or a PAYE
taxpayer.
