##  Occupational pensions

[ Occupational pensions ](/en/money-and-tax/personal-
finance/pensions/occupational-pensions/) are taxable. They are subject to tax
under the PAYE (Pay As You Earn) system, so the process is the same as when
you were being paid your salary. If you have both an occupational pension and
a  social welfare pension  , you may have to pay tax on both. Read more about
[ taxation of social welfare payments ](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-
welfare-system/claiming-a-social-welfare-payment/taxation-of-social-welfare-
payments/) .

Occupational pensions are not subject to [ social insurance contributions
(PRSI) ](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/social-insurance-
prsi/social-insurance/) but, if you are aged under 70, you may have to pay
PRSI on other income. Occupational pensions are subject to the [ Universal
Social Charge (USC) ](/en/money-and-tax/tax/income-tax/universal-social-
charge/) .

Many pensioners do not have to pay tax because the amount of their income is
below the level that is taxable. There are additional tax credits for people
aged over 65 and income exemption limits below which no tax is payable â€“ read
