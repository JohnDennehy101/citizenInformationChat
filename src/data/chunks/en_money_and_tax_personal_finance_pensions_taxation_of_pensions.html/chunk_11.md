##  Universal Social Charge (USC)

All social welfare payments, including social welfare pensions, are exempt
from USC.

However, occupational pensions are subject to USC. The rate you pay varies
depending on your age and on whether you hold a full medical card. See the
page on the [ Universal Social Charge ](/en/money-and-tax/tax/income-
tax/universal-social-charge/) for more information.
