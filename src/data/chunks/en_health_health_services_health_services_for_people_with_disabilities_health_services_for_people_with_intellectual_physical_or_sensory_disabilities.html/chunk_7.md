##  Making a complaint about residential care

If you want to make a complaint about the care and treatment of someone in
residential care (provided that the care is run by or funded by the HSE), you
can contact the ‘ [ Confidential Recipient ](http://www.hse.ie/confidential/)
’.

The confidential recipient is an independent person who represents people with
disabilities when a complaint is made. They will:

  * Listen to your concerns 
  * Keep your identity anonymous, if you prefer 
  * Support you and send your concern to the right place 
  * Make sure your concern is reviewed within 15 working days 

You can read more about [ how to make a complaint and contact the confidential

Alternatively, you can give feedback using the HSE’s ‘ [ Your service your
say’ ](https://www2.hse.ie/complaints-feedback/) facility.
