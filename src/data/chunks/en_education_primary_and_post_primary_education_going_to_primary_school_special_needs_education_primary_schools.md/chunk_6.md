####  **If you have concerns about the support given to your child with
special needs**

If you have concerns with the level of support being given to your child, you
should discuss this first with your child’s class teacher or special education
teacher. You could also discuss these issues with the school principal. If you
continue to have concerns, you can discuss with the Chairperson of your Board
of Management.

The allocation of special education teachers is provided on the basis that no
child will be refused enrolment on the grounds that the school does not have
sufficient teaching resources to meet that child’s needs. If your child is
refused enrolment to a school you may [ appeal this decision to a Section 29
Appeal Committee ](https://www.gov.ie/en/service/90de23-appeal-against-
permanent-exclusion-suspension-or-refusal-to-enrol/) .
