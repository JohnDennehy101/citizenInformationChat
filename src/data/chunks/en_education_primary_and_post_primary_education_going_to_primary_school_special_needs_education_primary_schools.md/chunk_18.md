####  **Assessment of education needs**

The [ Disability Act 2005
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2005/act/14/enacted/en/html) provides for
an Assessment of Need to identify your child's health needs and what health
services are needed to meet these needs. It is an assessment carried out by
the HSE for children or young people with a disability.

Since 2021, the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) must nominate a
person to carry out an assessment of education needs on behalf of the HSE when
an Assessment of Need is in process. Find out more about the [ Assessment of
