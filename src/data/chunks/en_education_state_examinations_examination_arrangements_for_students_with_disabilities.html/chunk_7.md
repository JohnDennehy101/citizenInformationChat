Your school has the authority to make special provisions for students with
special needs during State exams on the basis of what is best for you. Some of
the special provisions your school can make include:

  * Taking medicine, food or drinks into the examination centre where this is required for medical reasons. 
  * Use of a special desk or chair that is used in your classroom 
  * Use of low-vision aids that you normally use in the classroom 
  * Ensuring that deaf and hard-of-hearing students are seated close to the examination superintendent 
  * Granting breaks or rest periods in each examination session warranted by your physical or medical condition. (Under this special provision, the time taken for rest or as a break can be compensated for at the end of each examination period to a maximum of 20 minutes.) 

If you are not satisfied with the arrangements made, you can appeal to an
Independent Appeals Committee. The members of the forum are from outside the
Commission. All appeals are considered using the [ Framework of Principles
](http://www.examinations.ie/index.php?l=en&mc=ca&sc=rc) set out by the Expert
Advisory Group on State Examinations.
