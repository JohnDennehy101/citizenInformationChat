####  Questionnaires for the Regional Fertility Hub

When the Regional Fertility Hub gets your referral, the fertility team will
send you a male and a female questionnaire to complete and return. There can
be a waiting list for an appointment in a Regional Fertility Hub.

An appointment will not be issued until your questionnaires are completed and
returned to the fertility team in the regional fertility hub.

You can find [ examples of the questionnaire on the HSE website
](https://www.hse.ie/eng/about/who/acute-hospitals-division/woman-
infants/national-fertility-services/) .
