###  **Step 4: Consent and choosing an AHR clinic**

If you have been identified as requiring assisted human reproduction treatment
and you meet the criteria (see below) for free treatment from the HSE, you
will be given [ a HSE consent booklet for Assisted Human Reproduction Services
](https://www.hse.ie/eng/about/who/acute-hospitals-division/woman-
infants/national-fertility-services/assisted-human-reproduction-services-
consent-booklet.pdf) .

In the consent handbook, you can read about what services are included and
what are not. To access AHR services you must:

  * Choose your top 3 preferred private fertility clinics from the list of private HSE-approved fertility private providers 
  * Complete the consent form and return it to the Regional Fertility Hub
