###  Redundancy is a last option

Your employer must consult with you before deciding to make you redundant.
Redundancy is a last option and there must be valid economic, technical, or
organisational grounds justifying changes in the workforce.

Before your employer makes you redundant, they might offer you another job in
the business. This is known as ‘ [ alternative work
](/en/employment/unemployment-and-redundancy/redundancy/alternatives-to-
redundancy/) ’.
