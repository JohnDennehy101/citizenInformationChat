####  Requirement to consult

Your employer must enter into consultations with a view to agreement with your
representative. These consultations must take place as soon as possible and at
least 30 days before the notice of redundancy is given. The aim of the
consultation is to consider whether there are any alternatives to the
redundancies.

These rules are set out in the [ Protection of Employment Acts 1977-2024
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1977/en/act/pub/0007/index.html) .

If your employer makes you redundant before the 30-day notice period ends, you
have the right to seek redress from the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC).

The [ Employees (Provision of Information and Consultation) Act 2006
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2006/en/act/pub/0009/index.html) also
requires employers to consult with employees on substantial changes in the
workplace, including proposals for collective redundancies. The Act applies to
employers of 50 people or more.
