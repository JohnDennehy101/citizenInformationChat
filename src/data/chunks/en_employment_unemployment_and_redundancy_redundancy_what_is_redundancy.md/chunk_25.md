###  You think there was no genuine redundancy situation

A genuine redundancy is one where your employer has a real business reason to
make you redundant.

Signs your redundancy might not be a genuine include:

  * Your employer has recently hired new employees to do similar work 
  * You have a bad relationship with your employer or other people at work 
  * You are singled out or treated differently from other people at work
