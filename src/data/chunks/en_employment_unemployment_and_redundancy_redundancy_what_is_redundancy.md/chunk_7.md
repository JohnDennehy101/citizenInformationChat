###  Dismissal for other reasons

Your employer must have reasons that justify your dismissal. You may be
dismissed from your job for one of the following reasons:

  * Capability 
  * Competence 
  * Qualifications 
  * Conduct 

If you don’t think that your employer’s reasons are justified, you can bring a
claim for [ unfair dismissal ](/en/employment/unemployment-and-
redundancy/dismissal/unfair-dismissal/) .
