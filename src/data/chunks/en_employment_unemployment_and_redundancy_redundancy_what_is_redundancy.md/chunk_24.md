###  You think you were unfairly selected

Your employer should use fair and reasonable selection criteria in choosing
people to make redundant.

Examples where your selection could be unfair include:

  * Where the custom and practice in your workplace has been last in, first out and your selection did not follow this procedure 
  * Where your employment contract sets out criteria for selection which were not followed 

Your redundancy is unfair if your employer has [ discriminated in selecting
you ](/en/employment/equality-in-work/equality-in-the-workplace/) for
redundancy. For example if they make you redundant because you’re pregnant or
on maternity leave.

Your employer could also have chosen you for an unfair reason. Unfair reasons
include making you redundant because you’ve asked for one of your legal
rights, made a health and safety complaint or been on an official strike.
