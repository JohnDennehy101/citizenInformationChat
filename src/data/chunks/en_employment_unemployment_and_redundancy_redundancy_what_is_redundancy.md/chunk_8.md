##  Compulsory and non-compulsory redundancy

Before an employer formally goes through the redundancy procedure required by
legislation (compulsory redundancy), they can decide to offer a package to
encourage employees to volunteer to leave their roles.

This is sometimes known as non-compulsory redundancy. It is used to avoid the
compulsory redundancy process altogether or to reduce the numbers of employees
who will ultimately have to be made compulsorily redundant.
