####  Company directors

Generally, directors of owners' management companies are members of the
company, and have been elected by the wider membership of the company. In most
cases, a director’s term is limited to 3 years. However, a serving director
can be appointed or elected at annual general meetings to serve for further
terms, provided that this is not prohibited by the company’s articles of
association (part of the company constitution) or other governing documents.

Owner’s management companies and their directors are responsible for managing
the shared facilities, amenities, and services in their development. The
