###  Dispute resolution

You can apply to the Circuit Court for an order to enforce any rights or
obligations imposed under the Act. This includes the ownersâ€™ management
company, a unit owner, a trustee under a will or other settlement, a tenant
and the developer. The Court, instead of making an order, may direct the
parties to attempt to solve the matter by mediation.
