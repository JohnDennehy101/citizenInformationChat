###  Transfer of common areas

When the common areas are transferred to the company, the developer still has
the right to be in those common areas in order to complete them. The developer
must have a valid insurance policy for all risks relating to their use of the
multi-unit development. The developer must also indemnify the ownersâ€™
management company against claims in respect of acts or omissions by the
developer during completion works.

There is a general obligation on the developer to minimise inconvenience to
the unit owners and ensure that access is available to them at all reasonable
times.
