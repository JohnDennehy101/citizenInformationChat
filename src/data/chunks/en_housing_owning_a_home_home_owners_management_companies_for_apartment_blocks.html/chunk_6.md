##  What is an owners' management company?

An owners' management company manages the common areas in a multi-unit
development. The owner of each residential unit is entitled to membership of
the owners’ management company and is generally entitled to one vote. Where
alternative arrangements are already in operation, these may be continued,
provided they are just and equitable.

The owners' management company is part of the _conveyancing_ procedure for the
individual units. Conveyancing is the legal work involved in buying or selling
property. If the unit is sold or transferred to another person, the membership
of the owners’ management company automatically transfers to the new owner. It
is not necessary to formally execute the transfer or have it approved by the
directors of the company.

The Act refers to the organisations that manage multi-unit developments as
owners’ management companies even if the organisation is not a company. For
example, an unincorporated group or body may be responsible for the management
but they are under the same obligations as owners’ management companies that
are incorporated as companies.
