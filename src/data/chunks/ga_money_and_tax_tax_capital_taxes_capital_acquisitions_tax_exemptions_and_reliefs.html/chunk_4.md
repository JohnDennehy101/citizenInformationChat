###  **Small gift exemption**

The first €3,000 of the total value of all gifts from any one person in any
calendar year is exempt. So, you could get a gift from several people in the
same calendar year and the first €3,000 from each person is exempt from CAT.

You do not need to make a Capital Acquisitions Tax return to claim the small
gift exemption for gifts under this limit.

This exemption does not apply to inheritances.
