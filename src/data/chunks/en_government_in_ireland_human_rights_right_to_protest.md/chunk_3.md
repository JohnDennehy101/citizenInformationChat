##  When the legal protections do not apply

Most public protests take place without anyone breaking the law. If a person
taking part in a protest breaks the law, by acting in a violent manner for
example, it does not mean that the whole protest is unlawful.

The legal protections for the right to protest do not apply if:

  * Protesters behave in a threatening manner or use violence 
  * The protest is [ inciting hatred ](/en/justice/criminal-law/criminal-offences/law-on-hate-speech/) towards a group of people because of their race, colour, nationality, religion, ethnic or national origins, membership of the travelling community or sexual orientation 
  * The protest is on private land
