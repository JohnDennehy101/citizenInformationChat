##  Irish laws that protect the right to protest

People in Ireland have a right to protest peacefully in public places, as long
as they do not break the law. A protester can break the law if they commit [
public order offences ](/en/justice/criminal-law/criminal-offences/public-
order-offenses-in-ireland/) , like trespass or threatening and abusive
behaviour, or if they are inciting hatred.

The [ Irish Constitution ](/en/government-in-ireland/irish-
constitution-1/constitution-fundamental-rights/) and other human rights
instruments protect your right to:

  * Express yourself freely 
  * Meet freely with other people 
  * Organise groups with other people 

These protections are not absolute and can be limited by law. For example, you
have a right to associate (to form groups and to organise) but the Government
can pass laws declaring an organisation to be illegal.

Your right to free expression and free speech is restricted by [ defamation
laws ](/en/justice/civil-law/law-on-defamation/) , obscenity and [ censorship
](/en/government-in-ireland/irish-constitution-1/censorship/) laws, and [ laws
against hate speech ](/en/justice/criminal-law/criminal-offences/law-on-hate-
speech/) .
