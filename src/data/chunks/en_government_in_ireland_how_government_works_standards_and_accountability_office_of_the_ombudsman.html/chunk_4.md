##  What type of complaints can the Ombudsman investigate?

The Ombudsman can investigate a complaint if you believe that a public service
body has given you the wrong information or your complaint has not been dealt
with properly.

They can also investigate a decision that you think is unfair, or that the
reason for the decision has not been properly explained to you. You can also
complain about delays in a public body making a decision.

There are certain complaints that the Ombudsman cannot examine, including
complaints about:

  * Clinical judgements of doctors or other medical professionals 
  * Job applications 
  * Decisions relating to immigration or naturalisation 
  * How prisons are run 

You can [ read the list in full on the Ombudsman website

The Office of the Ombudsman cannot examine a complaint if you have already
started legal proceedings against a public body for the same complaint.
