###  **Collecting your payment**

Your OFP can be paid directly into your Post Office or into your bank account.

You will need to use your [ Public Services Card (PSC) ](/en/social-
welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/public-services-card/) to collect your
payment at the Post Office. If you do not have a PSC, you will need another
form of photographic ID to collect your payment.
