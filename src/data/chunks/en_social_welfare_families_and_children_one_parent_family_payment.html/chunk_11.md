###  What happens when my child is over the age limit?

Your OFP will stop when your youngest child reaches the age limit. The
Department of Social Protection (DSP) will tell you the end date for your
payment.

You may get the [ Jobseeker's Transitional payment ](/en/social-
welfare/unemployed-people/jobseekers-transitional-payment/) . This is a
payment for people parenting alone whose children are aged between 7 and 14
(the payment ends when the youngest child reaches 14).

You can find out more about [ what happens when your OFP ends ](/en/social-
welfare/families-and-children/moving-from-ofp/) .

You can also get information and advice about your options from:

  * Your local [ Intreo Centre or Social Welfare Branch Office ](https://www.gov.ie/en/directory/category/e1f4b5-intreo-offices/) , or 
  * Your local [ Citizens Information Centre ](http://centres.citizensinformation.ie/)
