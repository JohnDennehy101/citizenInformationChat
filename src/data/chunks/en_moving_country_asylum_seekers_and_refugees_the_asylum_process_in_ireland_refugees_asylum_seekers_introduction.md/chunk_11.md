##  Dublin Regulations

EU countries share international protection information, including
fingerprints (through the [ Eurodac system ](/en/moving-country/asylum-
seekers-and-refugees/the-asylum-process-in-ireland/eurodac-system/) ).

The [ Dublin III Regulations ](/en/moving-country/asylum-seekers-and-
refugees/the-asylum-process-in-ireland/dublin-convention/) are EU laws that
set out the criteria that an EU country should use to decide which country
should take charge of your application for international protection.

When you apply for international protection, you are asked about your history
as part of your application. If you have made an application for international
protection in another EU country, or if the IPO decides that another country
should be responsible for your international protection application, you could
be transferred to that country.
