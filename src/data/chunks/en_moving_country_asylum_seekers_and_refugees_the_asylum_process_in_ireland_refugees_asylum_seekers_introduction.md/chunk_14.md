##  Temporary Protection Directive

The [ Temporary Protection Directive ](/en/moving-country/asylum-seekers-and-
refugees/the-asylum-process-in-ireland/temporary-protection-directive/) is an
EU law that was introduced in 2001. The Directive created a special procedure
to deal with a ‘mass influx’ of people in need of international protection.
The Directive must be triggered by the [ EU Commission ](/en/government-in-
ireland/european-government/eu-institutions/european-commission/) .

When the Directive is triggered, EU countries can grant immediate protection
to people without the need for individual applications for international
protection. People who are granted temporary protection get a residence permit
for the duration of the protection (a minimum of one year and a maximum of 3
years). They also get access to:

  * Employment 
  * Accommodation 
  * Social welfare 
  * Healthcare 
  * Education for children 

The Directive also allows EU countries to transfer people to other member
states, with the agreement of the receiving country and the person being
transferred.

The Directive was adopted into Irish law by [ Section 60 of the International
Protection Act 2015
](https://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2015/act/66/section/60/enacted/en/html#sec60)
.

first time in March 2022 in response to the [ war in Ukraine ](/en/moving-
