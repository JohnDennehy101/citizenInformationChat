##  What is the Local Authority Purchase and Renovation Loan?

The [ Local Authority Purchase and Renovation Loan
](https://www.gov.ie/en/press-release/97db0-local-authority-purchase-and-
renovation-loan-to-support-first-time-buyers-turn-vacant-or-derelict-
buildings-into-new-homes/) (LAPR) is a government-backed mortgage and loan
that helps you to buy and renovate a derelict or uninhabitable home.

The loan is for first-time buyers, and ‘fresh start applicants’, who have been
unable to get funding from commercial lenders. It is an extension of the [
Local Authority Home Loan ](/en/housing/owning-a-home/help-with-buying-a-
home/local-authority-mortgages/) .

You must qualify for the [ Vacant Property Refurbishment Grant
](/en/housing/housing-grants-and-schemes/local-authority-housing-grants-and-
supports/vacant-property-refurbishment-grant/) to get this loan.

The loan has 2 parts, a fixed rate mortgage loan and a variable rate bridging
loan. The interest-only bridging loan is for the amount you’ve been approved
for the Vacant Property Refurbishment Grant. You pay the bridging loan back as
soon as you get the grant.
