##  Introduction

The criminal law gives the Garda√≠ certain powers to detain you in their
custody after you have been arrested. The purpose of detaining you after your
arrest is twofold:

  * To ensure that you appear before a court to answer charges 
  * To ensure that criminal offences are properly investigated 

It is important to understand that the powers of detention depend on the
offence for which you have been arrested.

If you are charged and brought before the District Court, you may be either
released on bail or detained in custody while waiting for your trial. This is
called being _on remand_ .
