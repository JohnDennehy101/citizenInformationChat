##  On remand in custody

When you are brought to the District Court for the first time after you are
charged, the court has 2 options:

  * It may remand you in custody for a period of no longer than 8 days. This means that you are detained in custody until a particular date when you will be brought back before the court. This date is called the _remand date_ . If you are remanded in custody in Dublin, you will be brought to Cloverhill Prison. 
  * It may remand you on [ bail ](/en/justice/arrests/bail-and-surety/) for a period that is longer than 8 days if you and the prosecution consent. This means that you are released on bail but you must appear before the Court on a particular date (the remand date). 

When you are brought before the District Court for the second and subsequent
times, the court has 2 options:

  * It may remand you in custody for a period of 15 days or less. 
  * It may remand you in custody for a period of 16 to 30 days, if you and the prosecution consent. 

If you are unable to go to court due to illness, the court may remand you in
custody in your absence.

If you have been remanded in custody and there is no sitting of the court on
the remand date, you will be remanded in custody to the next sitting of a
court in the same District Court District.

If you have been remanded on bail and there is no sitting of the court on the
remand date, you will be remanded to the next sitting of a court in the same
District Court area.

If you are remanded in custody for a period of 4 days or less, the court may
commit you to the custody of the Garda√≠. This means that you are kept at a
Garda station instead of in a prison.
