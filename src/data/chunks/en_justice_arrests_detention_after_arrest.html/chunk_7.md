###  What happens when my detention ends?

If the Garda√≠ no longer have any grounds for believing that your detention is
necessary to properly investigate the offence or your detention period has
expired, then you normally must be either charged with the offence or released
from custody. If you are being charged with the offence you are brought before
the court.

If you are detained under Section 42 and your detention is no longer required
or it has expired, you are returned to prison without being charged.
