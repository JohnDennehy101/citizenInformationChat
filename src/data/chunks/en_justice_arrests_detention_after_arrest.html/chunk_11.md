###  Section 4 of the Criminal Justice Act 1984

A Section 4 detention applies to any offence for which an adult (who hasn't
been previously convicted), may be punished by imprisonment for a term of five
years or more. Most offences for which you can be arrested carry a penalty
like this, so they come within the scope of Section 4.
