###  How long can I be detained for?

The maximum period of detention ranges from 24 hours to 7 days depending on
which section of the legislation you are being detained under. In most cases,
you can be initially detained for up to 6 hours on the authorisation of the
member in charge of the Garda station. For offences under Section 30 of the
Offences Against the State Act 1939 your initial detention period can be up to
24 hours. To detain you under Section 42 of the Criminal Justice Act 1999 the
Garda√≠ have to first obtain a warrant from the District Court authorising your
arrest and initial detention. You can then be taken from the prison to a Garda
station.

Generally, after your initial period of detention ends, up to 2 further
detention periods can be authorised by a Garda of the rank of Superintendent
or higher. Depending on the section of the law applying to your detention, the
authorisation for a further extension may have to be given by a Garda of the
rank of Chief Superintendent or higher.

Further periods of detention may be granted following application to the
District or Circuit Court by a Garda of the rank of Chief Superintendent or
higher. For Section 30 of the Offences Against the State Act 1939 application
can be made to the District Court by the Superintendent.

The maximum periods of detention applying under the various sections of
legislation are given in the following table:
