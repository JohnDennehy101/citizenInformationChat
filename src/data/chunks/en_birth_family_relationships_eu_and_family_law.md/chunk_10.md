###  Recognition of decisions

The Regulation provides that a decision on a matrimonial matter made in one
member state must be recognised and enforced in the other states without any
special procedures. You do not have to go to court to have it recognised.
However, any interested party may ask the court in the other member state not
to recognise the decision. The court may refuse to recognise the decision:

  * If such recognition is clearly contrary to public policy 
  * If the decision contradicts another decision 
  * If there were certain procedural defects with the decision â€“ in particular if one party was not properly served with the relevant papers and did not put in an appearance as a result 

The court is not entitled to hear an appeal against the foreign decision.
