###  Recognition and enforcement

Judgments given in one member state must be recognised and enforced in another
member state. The court in the other member state may refuse to recognise the
order only on the grounds that:

  * It would be manifestly contrary to that member stateâ€™s public policy 
  * The child was not given an opportunity to be heard (except in urgent cases) 
  * The judgment was given in the absence of a person who was not served with the documents instituting the proceedings in sufficient time and in such a way as to enable them to arrange for their defence 
  * A person claiming that the judgment infringes their parental responsibility was not given the opportunity to be heard 

If you are applying to a court in another member state for recognition and
enforcement, you are entitled to legal aid there if you were entitled in your
own state. You may also get help from the Central Authority in the country
where you are seeking recognition and enforcement.
