###  Hague Conventions

The [ Hague Convention
](http://www.hcch.net/index_en.php?act=conventions.text&cid=24) of 25 October
1980 on the civil aspects of international child abduction (“the 1980 Hague
Convention”) and the [ Hague Convention (1996)
](http://www.hcch.net/index_en.php?act=conventions.text&cid=70) on
jurisdiction, applicable law, recognition, enforcement and cooperation in
respect of parental responsibility and measures for the protection of children
continue to apply in cases where the 2003 or 2019 Regulations do not.

The European Convention on Recognition and Enforcement of Decisions Concerning
Custody of Children and on Restoration of Custody of Children [ (the
Luxembourg Convention)
](http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/EN/Treaties/Html/105.htm) applies to a
number of European countries. It is now of limited relevance because the EU
Regulation or the Hague Convention covers the relevant countries.

Both Conventions were signed in 1980. They were brought into effect in Ireland
in 1991 by the [ Child Abduction and Enforcement of Court Orders Act 1991
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1991/en/act/pub/0006/index.html) .
