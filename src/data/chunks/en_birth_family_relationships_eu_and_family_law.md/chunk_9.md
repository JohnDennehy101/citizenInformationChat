###  Jurisdiction

Regulations 2019/1111 and 2201/2013 provide that you may take a matrimonial
action in the courts of the EU member state where:

  * one or both of you are or were habitually resident, or 
  * the member state of your common nationality, or 
  * your common [ domicile ](/en/money-and-tax/tax/moving-country-and-taxation/tax-residence-and-domicile-in-ireland/) . 

This means, of course, that it may be possible to take the action in a number
of states. The Regulation provides that once proceedings have started in a
particular member state, other states must refuse jurisdiction.

The Regulation does not deal with the question of which law applies. This is a
matter for the member state that has jurisdiction. For example, most countries
other than Ireland apply the law of the country of [ habitual residence
](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/social-assistance-
payments/habitual-residence-condition/) of the parties while Ireland applies
the law of the country of [ domicile ](/en/money-and-tax/tax/moving-country-
and-taxation/tax-residence-and-domicile-in-ireland/) .
