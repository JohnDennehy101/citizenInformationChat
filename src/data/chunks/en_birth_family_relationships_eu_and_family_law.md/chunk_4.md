###  EU competence to deal with family law

The EU is only able to make laws in areas where EU treaties give it the
specific power to do so. It cannot make laws in relation to divorce,
maintenance or parental responsibility. This means the EU cannot make laws
setting out the terms under which a divorce may be granted, or the
responsibility of spouses to pay maintenance, or how decisions on custody and
access to children are to be made.

However, the EU does have responsibility to promote judicial (legal) co-
operation in civil matters which have cross border implications. It has made a
number of regulations dealing with judicial co-operation. In general, these
regulations are based on the principle of mutual recognition â€“ that is, that
decisions lawfully made in one EU country should be recognised and enforced in
other EU countries and the procedures for doing so should be as simple as
possible.
