###  The law applicable to international divorces

[ Regulation 2201/2003 ](http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-
content/EN/TXT/?qid=1422886426094&uri=URISERV:l33194) or [ 2019/1111
](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-
content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv%3AOJ.L_.2019.178.01.0001.01.ENG&toc=OJ%3AL%3A2019%3A178%3ATOC)
do not determine what law applies when an application for divorce is being
considered. For example, if an Irish person living in Spain wants to divorce a
German spouse who is living in France, which national law applies?

[ Regulation 1259/2010 ](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-
content/en/ALL/?uri=CELEX%3A32010R1259) (known as "the Rome III Regulation")
implementing enhanced cooperation in the area of the law applicable to divorce
and legal separation currently applies in 17 member states. Ireland has not
opted into this Regulation. The Regulation allows international couples in the
member states where it applies to agree in advance which law will apply to
their divorce or legal separation, as long as the agreed law is the law of the
member state with which they have a closer connection. In case the couple
cannot agree, the judge can use a common formula for deciding which country's
law applies.
