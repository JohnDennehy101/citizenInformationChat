##  Quad bike training

Since November 2023, it is compulsory for anyone driving a quad to complete a
training course with a registered training provider. This applies even if you
only drive your quad on a farm.

There are one-day and 2-day training courses available. The costs can vary
slightly and depend on your driving experience. You may get a discount for
group bookings. Check with the course provider directly.

You must ensure the training provider is registered (for example, LANTRA, City
& Guilds NPTC, QQI or an equivalent). The training course must meet the [
minimum standard in the QQI ATV and quad bike training
](https://qsdocs.qqi.ie/sites/docs/AwardsLibraryPdf/5N1752_AwardSpecifications_English.pdf)
.

The training combines theory and practice. After successfully completing the
course, you will receive a certificate, which is generally valid for 5 years.
