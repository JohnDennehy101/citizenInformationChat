##  Quad bike helmets

Under the new rules, you must wear a helmet when using a quad. The helmet is
typically a motorcycle helmet or a specialist ATV (all-terrain vehicle)
helmet. The type of helmet chosen must be based on an assessment of the
circumstance in which the quad bike will be used, such as the types of surface
travelled over and anticipated speeds. The harder the surface and higher the
speed, the greater the degree of protection needed.

The helmet should:

  * Have a chinstrap 
  * Be capable of being used with suitable eye protection 
  * Fit comfortably and securely 

Standard industrial hard hats, forestry helmets or cycling helmets are not
acceptable helmets.
