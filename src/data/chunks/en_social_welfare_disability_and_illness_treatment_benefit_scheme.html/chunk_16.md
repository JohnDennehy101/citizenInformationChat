##  How to apply for Treatment Benefit

Claims are made through your provider (dentist, dispensing
optician/optometrist/ophthalmologist or audiologist), who can check your
entitlement in advance of treatment and claim payment afterwards.

Your provider will require some information to identify you, such as your date
of birth and [ PPS number ](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-
system/personal-public-service-number/) . Prior to treatment, you will need to
sign a Consent Form agreeing to your provider having this information and
giving your consent to have this information supplied to the Department of
Social Protection, to enable payment of your claim.

If you are claiming as a dependant under the PRSI record of your spouse, civil
partner or cohabitant, both you and your spouse or partner will need to sign
the Consent Form.

For treatment received in other EU member states, you contact the Treatment
Benefit Section at the address below to confirm your eligibility. If eligible,
you send your receipts to the Treatment Benefit Section along with a letter
containing your contact information and details of your bank account (account
name, number and sort code) into which payment will be made.
