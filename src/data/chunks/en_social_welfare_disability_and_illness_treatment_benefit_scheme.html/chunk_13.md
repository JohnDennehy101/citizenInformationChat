###  Qualified at 60 and over

If you qualify for benefit at age 60â€“65, you retain that entitlement for life.
If you have retired on grounds of ill health or you are considered to be
unemployed, you can apply for Illness Benefit or Jobseeker's Benefit, subject
to satisfying the statutory conditions. Your entitlement to these benefits may
also lead to your being awarded credited contributions, which can be taken
into account to extend coverage for treatment benefits for further periods.
