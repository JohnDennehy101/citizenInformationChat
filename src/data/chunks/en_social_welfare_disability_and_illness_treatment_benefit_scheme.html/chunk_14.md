###  Spouse, civil partner or cohabitant

A spouse, civil partner or cohabitant may, of course, qualify in their own
right if they have enough social insurance contributions.

If your spouse, civil partner or cohabitant does not have enough social
insurance contributions they may still qualify for Treatment Benefit on your
social insurance record. To do this, you must qualify for Treatment Benefit
and your spouse, civil partner or cohabitant must be dependent on you.

A dependent spouse, civil partner or cohabitant must:

  * Have a gross income of €100 or less per week. If earning more than €100 per week, he/she must have been dependent on you before entering or resuming insurable employment (at Class A, E, H, P or S). 
  * **Not** be getting a social welfare payment (except Disablement Pension, Supplementary Welfare Allowance, Carer's Benefit or Child Benefit). If getting Carer's Allowance or State Pension (Non-Contributory), he/she can qualify if he/she was dependent on you immediately before getting the Allowance or Pension. 

If an insured person dies and the dependent spouse or civil partner was
entitled to benefit at the time of the death, they retain entitlement for as
long as they remain widowed or a surviving civil partner.
