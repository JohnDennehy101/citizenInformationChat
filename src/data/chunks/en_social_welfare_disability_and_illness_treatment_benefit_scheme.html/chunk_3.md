###  Treatment Benefit in the EU

If you choose to have treatment in another EU member state, the DSP will pay
an amount equivalent to the rate paid for similar treatments carried out in
Ireland or the amount actually paid for the treatment - whichever is the
lower. You must still have the qualifying PRSI contributions.

Contact the Treatment Benefit Section (see 'Contact details' below) before you
travel to get an application form and details of the amounts the DSP will pay.
