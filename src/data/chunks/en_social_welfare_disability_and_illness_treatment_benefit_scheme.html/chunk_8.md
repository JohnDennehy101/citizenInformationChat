##  Medical lenses

If you need contact lenses for medical reasons, you can get up to €1,000
towards the cost of a pair of medical contact lenses (€500 for each contact
lens) once every 2 years. This applies to a small number of eye conditions
that make wearing glasses impossible. You must have a doctor's recommendation.
Contact lenses are not available on purely cosmetic grounds. Contact lenses
for optical purposes are available through the Optical Benefit scheme above.
