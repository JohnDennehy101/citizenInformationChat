###  Orphan's Pension

This is paid on behalf of a child if the parent, step-parent or person who
supported the child died as a result of an accident at work, an occupational
disease or was getting a Disablement Pension assessed as 50% or more at the
time of their death. The orphan's guardian should apply for the payment.
