##  Introduction

If a person dies because of an accident at work or occupational disease, Death
Benefit (under the [ Occupational Injuries Scheme ](/en/social-
welfare/disability-and-illness/occupational-injuries-benefit-overview/) ) may
be paid to their surviving spouse or civil partner or dependent child. Death
Benefit may also be paid if, at the time of their death, the person was
getting a [ Disablement Pension ](/en/social-welfare/disability-and-
illness/disablement-benefit/) assessed at 50% or more, regardless of the cause
of death.

The Death Benefit Scheme includes:

  * Widow's, Widower's or Surviving Civil Partner's Pension 
  * Orphan's Pension 
  * Funeral Grant
