##  When is the other parent's consent needed to remove a child from the
State?

The other parent’s consent is necessary for the child’s removal to another
state when:

  * The other parent is a guardian of the child 
  * When the removal of the child affects custody and/or sometimes access rights 
  * When a court order has specifically stated that the consent of the other parent or any other named party is needed before the child’s removal to another state.
