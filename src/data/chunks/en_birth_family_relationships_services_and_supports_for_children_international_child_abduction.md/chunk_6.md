##  What should I do if my child is at risk of international abduction?

If you believe your child is at risk of abduction you should get legal advice
and contact the Gardaí.

You can apply to the court requesting that it direct who should hold the
passports, for example, you, the Gardaí, the courts.

If you are the legal guardian of your child (or have applied to be a guardian)
you may contact the Passport Office and request that you be informed if the
other parent applies for a passport for your child.
