##  What is international child abduction?

Child abduction occurs when a child is removed from the person who has the
legal right to custody without that person’s consent or agreement.

International child abduction occurs when a child is:

  * Taken out of the country in which the child and the person who has the legal right to custody normally live (the child is unlawfully removed from a country) 
  * Kept in another country where the child is visiting (the child is unlawfully retained in a country) 

The abductor may be any person but frequently is one of the child’s parents.

For example, a child who is in the custody of their mother in Ireland is
visited in Ireland by their father who lives in Spain. The child is then taken
back to Spain by the father without the consent of the mother. The child has
been abducted and unlawfully removed from Ireland by their father.

In another example, a child who is in the custody of their father in Ireland
may go to visit their mother in the USA. If the mother keeps the child there
beyond the agreed visiting time, the child been abducted and is unlawfully
retained in the USA by their mother.

So, an abduction may involve the **wrongful removal** or the **wrongful
retention** of a child.

International child abduction is a criminal offence in Ireland. A parent or
anyone else who unlawfully abducts a child may be convicted of the offence.
