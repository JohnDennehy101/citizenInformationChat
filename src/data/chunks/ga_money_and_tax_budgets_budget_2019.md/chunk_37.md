###  Key Employee Engagement Programme (KEEP)

KEEP facilitates the use of a share-based remuneration by small and medium-
sized enterprises (SMEs) to attract key employees. It is available for
qualifying share options granted between 1 January 2018 and 31 December 2023.
Budget 2019 has introduced changes to help SMEs to compete for skilled staff,
which include:

  * Increased ceiling on maximum annual market value of shares that may be awarded to equal the amount of the salary (up from 50%) 
  * Introduction of a lifetime limit 
  * Increased overall value of options that can be awarded per employee from €250,000 to €300,000
