###  **Disability- specific training**

For example:

  * ISL (Irish Sign Language) training for employees if a colleague or employer is deaf. 
  * Lámh employee training if a colleague or employer uses Lámh for communication. 
  * Courses on best practices for including people with specific disabilities in the workplace, like those with neurodiversity, when a colleague or employer is neurodivergent.
