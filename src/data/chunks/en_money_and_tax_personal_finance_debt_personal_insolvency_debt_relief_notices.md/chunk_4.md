###  Qualifying debts

In general, you will usually only qualify for a DRN if all of your debts are
unsecured and if the total of your debt to all your creditors adds up to
€35,000 or less.

**Unsecured debts**

A Debt Relief Notice mainly covers _unsecured_ debts (though it can include
some secured debts – see below) so it is important to know whether your debts
are secured or not.

In general, debts such as the following are unsecured:

  * Utility bill arrears (gas, electricity etc.) 
  * Rent arrears 
  * Credit card debt 
  * Store card debt 
  * Bank overdrafts 
  * Unsecured bank loans 

However, if they are rolled up into your mortgage, they become secured loans.

**Secured debts**

A _secured_ debt is a loan on which property or goods are available as
security against non-payment. Mortgages and car loans are the most common
secured loans. (If you have this type of debt, you cannot get a DRN but you
may apply for another personal insolvency option.)

**Exceptions**

While a DRN will not cover mortgages or similar large-scale secured debt, in
certain exceptional cases a loan may be secured against a small item of
property, such as a ring. Such a secured debt can be included in a DRN, but
only if the creditor agrees.
