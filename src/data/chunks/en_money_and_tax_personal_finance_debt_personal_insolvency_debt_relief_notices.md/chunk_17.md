##  How to apply

Your application for a Debt Relief Notice must be made through an Approved
Intermediary (AI). You can choose an AI from the [ Register of Approved
Intermediaries ](https://backontrack.ie/get-help/find-an-approved-
intermediary/) that is published by the ISI. All [ Money Advice and Budgeting
Services (MABS) ](/en/money-and-tax/personal-finance/debt/mabs-service/) are
