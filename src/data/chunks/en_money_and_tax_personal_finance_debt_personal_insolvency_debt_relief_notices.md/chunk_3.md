##  Am I eligible?

A Debt Relief Notice deals with qualifying debts of up to â‚¬35,000 in the case
of people who have very low disposable income or assets and no prospect of
being able to pay off their debts in the next 3 years.

The [ MABS Helpline ](https://mabs.ie/contact/#phone) provides a free service
to check if you are eligible for a DRN.

You can only get a DRN once.

You cannot get a DRN if you are involved in one of the other [ personal
insolvency options ](/en/money-and-tax/personal-finance/debt/personal-
insolvency/personal-insolvency-arrangements/) , or the [ bankruptcy
](/en/money-and-tax/personal-finance/debt/personal-insolvency/what-is-
bankruptcy/) process, or if you have completed such a process within the last
5 years.
