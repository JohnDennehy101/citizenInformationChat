###  Paying part of your debts

If your income increases, or you get gifts, above a certain amount during the
3-year supervision period, you will have to give half to repay your debts.

  * If your net income increases by €400 or more per month, you must give half of that increase to the ISI 
  * If you get a gift or payment worth €500 or more, you must give half of it to the ISI 

Your income increase is taken as whichever is the higher figure after
comparing your new income to:

  * Your income at the time of your application 
  * Your reasonable living expenses at the time of your application 

Income is calculated after tax, social insurance payments, levies, and
payments made to any debts excluded from the DRN.

Any amounts you give to the Insolvency Service will be distributed to the
relevant creditors in proportion to the size of the debts that you owe to each
creditor.

If you pay 50% or more of the total debts covered by the Debt Relief Notice,
you can exit the process before the end of the 3-year supervision period.
