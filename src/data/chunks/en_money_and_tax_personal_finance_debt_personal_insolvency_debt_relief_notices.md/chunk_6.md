###  Income and asset tests

All of your income will be taken into account, except for [ Child Benefit
](/en/social-welfare/families-and-children/child-benefit/) . Any assets that
you have will also be valued.

**Income**

You will only qualify for a DRN if, after deducting certain outgoings, you
would be left with a net monthly disposable income of €60 or less after paying
reasonable living expenses. The 2 types of outgoings are:

  * **Payments in respect of debts that are outside the DRN process** – these are either _excluded_ debts that cannot be covered, or _excludable_ debts that the creditor has not agreed to include, as outlined above 
  * **Reasonable living expenses** , which will be assessed in accordance with detailed guidelines – see below 

Your net disposable income takes account of your income from salary, wages,
pensions and contributions from other household members. Any other income
available to you is also taken into account – including all social welfare
payments except Child Benefit.

Deductions are then made for:

  * Income tax, PRSI and other charges/levies on income (such as [ Universal Social Charge ](/en/money-and-tax/tax/income-tax/universal-social-charge/) ) 
  * Payments that you make in respect of excluded debts and excludable debts (unless they are _permitted_ debts that the creditor agrees to include in the DRN 
  * Reasonable living expenses - see below 

**Assets**

The total value of your assets must be €1,500 or less. They are assessed at
market value and include savings, shares and property. The following assets
are not taken into account:

  * Essential household equipment and appliances and books, tools or equipment needed for employment or business, up to a total value of €6,000 
  * Books or equipment that are reasonably necessary to enable you or a dependant to participate in and complete a course of education (at primary or secondary level only) 
  * A vehicle that has been adapted for a person with a disability (either you or one of your dependants) 
  * A motor vehicle up to a value of €5,000 * 
  * One item of personal jewellery to a maximum value of €750 * 
  * Any future pension entitlement or option that you cannot choose to access at present 

* A motor vehicle or piece of jewellery cannot be excluded from the asset test if the cost of buying it forms part of your qualifying debts. 

**Reasonable standard of living and reasonable living expenses**

You must be left with enough income to have a reasonable standard of living
for yourself and your dependants.

The [ Insolvency Service of Ireland (ISI) ](https://www.isi.gov.ie/) is
responsible for drawing up guidelines on what is a reasonable standard of
living and reasonable living expenses. The guidelines provide examples of what
may and may not be allowed as reasonable living expenses. They are reviewed
every year.

You can use the ISI's [ reasonable living expenses calculator
](http://backontrack.ie/RLE-Calculator/) to find out what your household's
monthly expenses would be assessed at.
