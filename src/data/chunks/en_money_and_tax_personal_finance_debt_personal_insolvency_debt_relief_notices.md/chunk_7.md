##  How does a Debt Relief Notice work?

If a DRN is issued for you, it will allow for the write-off of your qualifying
debt up to €35,000, subject to a 3-year supervision period. You will still
have to pay any excluded debts and for any excludable debts that your
creditors have not agreed to include in the DRN - see ‘Excluded and excludable
debts’ above.

During the supervision period, you cannot get credit of €650 or more, either
on your own or as part of a joint application with someone else, without
telling the lender that you have a Debt Relief Notice.

You will have to tell the Insolvency Service of any change in your
circumstances, for example, any increases in income, assets or liabilities. If
your financial position improves above certain limits, you will have to repay
part of your debts – see ‘Paying part of your debts’ below.

You will also have to tell the ISI if you become aware of any errors or
omissions in the documentation included in your application for the DRN. The
ISI has extensive powers of investigation of anything that it considers
relevant to your case.

The Circuit Court may extend the supervision period in certain circumstances –
see ‘Extension or unsuccessful ending of a DRN’ below.

Details of your DRN will be placed on a public Register of Debt Relief
Notices.
