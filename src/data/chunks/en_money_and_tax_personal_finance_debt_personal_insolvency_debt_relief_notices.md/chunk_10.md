###  Debt Relief Certificate

At the end of the supervision period (or if you have managed to pay 50% or
more of your debts) the Debt Relief Notice will cease to have effect. You will
be discharged from the debts it covered and any interest or penalties on those
debts. All of the information about your DRN will be removed from the public
Register of Debt Relief Notices and you will be given a Debt Relief
Certificate, confirming that you have been discharged from the relevant debts.
The ISI will also write to all the creditors concerned, to tell them that the
Debt Relief Notice has been removed from the Register.
