####  **Example of protections when you have an LTA**

Patrick books a flight to Helsinki directly with an airline (service 1).
Shortly after receiving an email to confirm his flight, he gets an email with
a targeted offer of a hotel in Helsinki. Patrick uses the link to book the
hotel (service 2), and he does this within 24 hours after getting the email to
confirm his flight booking.

Unfortunately, when in Helsinki, Patrick learns that the travel organiser for
his flight has gone bankrupt. Patrick has rights under travel legislation to
cover the cost of his flight home (service 1). These are covered under the
airlineâ€™s insolvency protection. But, the airline will not help Patrick if he
has any issue with accommodation (service 2), as this is not a package
holiday.
