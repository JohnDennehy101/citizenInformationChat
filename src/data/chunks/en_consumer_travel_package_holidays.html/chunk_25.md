###  Making a complaint while you are away

If you have a complaint while on your trip away, you should report the problem
at once to your local holiday representative or travel organiser in the area.

The organiser must compensate you for any shortfalls in the service it
provides â€“ between what was originally promised or advertised and what was
actually provided.

You should give the travel organiser the chance to put things right. The
solution they suggest should be at no extra cost to you.

If you are not satisfied that the problem has been resolved, you should gather
as much evidence as possible to support your case while you are away,
including taking photographs or video footage (if you can).
