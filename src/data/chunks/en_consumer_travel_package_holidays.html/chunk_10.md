###  Information you must get before you book

The travel organiser must give you all of the essential information about the
holiday before you agree to the contract. You must be told about:

  * The travel product you are buying (that is, whether it is a package or linked travel arrangement) and the level of insolvency protection associated with it 
  * Where you are going and for how long 
  * The costs involved for the holiday itself and payment schedule (if this applies), as well as any tax or compulsory charges 
  * The mode of transport â€“ this detail includes times, dates and places of departure and return 
  * Where and what your accommodation is (for example, hotel, guesthouse), and how it complies with the law of the EU Member State in question 
  * The meal plan, if any 
  * Cancellation details (for example, where a minimum take up is needed for a package holiday to come into being in the first place) 
  * Itinerary of any excursions included such as golf outings 
  * Contact details of the travel organiser or, if appropriate, the insurer 
  * Any special or exceptional requirements, which you asked for and you and other parties to the contract have accepted 
  * The complaints procedure to follow if the travel organiser does not carry out their part of the contract 
  * Passport and any visa requirements 
  * Health requirements (that is, if you have to have any special vaccinations or health advice) 
  * Special arrangements for bringing you home (repatriation) if there are any unexpected events 
  * How any payments will be refunded if the travel organiser becomes bankrupt 
  * Whether insurance is compulsory as part of your package holiday and if so, the minimum level of cover needed 

**Tip:** Remember that you cannot be forced to take out the travel organiser's
insurance. Where insurance is optional, your travel organiser must give you
information to help you to decide whether to insure or not, if they have this
information.
