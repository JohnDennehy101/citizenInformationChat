##  Insolvency protection

The Irish Aviation Authority licenses travel agents and tour operators (‘
_travel organisers_ ’) in Ireland.

Your travel organiser must provide a financial guarantee (also known as
insolvency protection). If your travel organiser goes out of business, this
guarantee covers refunds you are due and costs of bringing you home if
necessary (repatriation).

Check if your travel organiser is licensed on the [ website of the Irish
Aviation Authority ](http://www.aviationreg.ie/travel-trade-the-commissions-
role/licence-holders.154.html) .
