###  If you want to cancel the holiday

You can cancel your booking at any time before travelling, although you should
try to give reasonable notice. However, you may have to pay a cancellation
fee.

You have the right to cancel your booking for free before the start of the
package, in the event of _unavoidable and extraordinary_ circumstances taking
place at or near your destination which would affect your holiday, or your
travel to the destination.

Examples include:

  * A natural disaster like a flood or earthquake 
  * War or terrorism 
  * A serious disease 

The organiser is also responsible for covering the costs of bringing you home
(repatriation) and any possible extra costs.

If you want to cancel a holiday (for example, because you have tested positive
for COVID-19), you are not guaranteed a refund. In this case, check the terms
and conditions of your contract for information on cancellations. You can
contact the travel agent to discuss the options available to you.
