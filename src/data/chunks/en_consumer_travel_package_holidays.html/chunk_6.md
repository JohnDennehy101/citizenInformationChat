####  Example of protections when you have a customised package

Maria booked a flight to France directly on the website of an airline. When
booking, she was offered accommodation at a hotel. She chose to book both the
flight and the hotel. The airlineâ€™s website charged a total price for all
travel services, so this created a customised travel package holiday.

Unfortunately, when Maria got to the hotel it was being done up and there were
no rooms available. Maria has rights under package travel legislation. She can
ask and get the airline to help her get accommodation at the same or a higher
standard.
