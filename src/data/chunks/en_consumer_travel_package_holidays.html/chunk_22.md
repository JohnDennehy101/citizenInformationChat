####  I accepted a refund credit note for a cancellation last year but I still
cannot use it. How long do I have to use it?

Your refund credit note is valid for 2 years from the date it was issued to
you. You have 2 years to book a holiday with your package travel organiser for
future travel.

You can redeem the refund credit note for its value in cash 9 months from the
date it was issued, once you have not used it to book an alternative holiday.

All COVID-19 refund credit notes issued by Irish package travel organisers are
protected by a State guarantee.

This means that if you havenâ€™t used your refund credit note by the end of the
2 years, you can get a full cash refund. If you have used only some of the
credit note value, you can get a cash refund of the remaining balance.
