##  Introduction

If you are from a country that is not in the European Economic Area (the EU,
plus Norway, Iceland and Lichtenstein), the UK or Switzerland, you need
permission to work in Ireland. In most cases, this means you have to apply for
an employment permit. There are 8 different [ types of employment permit
](/en/moving-country/working-in-ireland/employment-permits/overview-
employment-permits/) .

The Atypical Working Scheme allows non-EEA nationals to do certain short-term
contract work that is not eligible for an employment permit. Under the Scheme,
non-EEA nationals, such as locum doctors or those on short-term contracts (of
up to 90 days), are allowed to work in Ireland.

In addition, crew members of certain fishing fleets can get permission to work
under the Scheme.

The Scheme is administered by Immigration Service Delivery (ISD).

You can only apply for the Scheme from outside of Ireland.
