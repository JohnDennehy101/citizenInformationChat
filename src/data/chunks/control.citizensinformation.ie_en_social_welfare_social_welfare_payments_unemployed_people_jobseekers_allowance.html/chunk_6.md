###  Disqualification and reduction in payment

You may not be entitled to JA in certain situations. This is known as being
_disqualified_ . You could be disqualified from getting JA for up to 9 weeks
if you:

  * Left work voluntarily and without just cause 
  * Lost your job through misconduct 
  * Refused an offer of suitable employment or training and you have been on a penalty rate of JA for at least 21 days 

Your payment can be reduced if you do not attend meetings requested by the DSP
or if you do not participate in an appropriate employment support scheme, work
experience or training (see also ‘Penalty rates’ below).
