##  What is signing on?

If you lose your job, are made redundant, laid off or if your working hours
are reduced you may qualify for a social welfare payment, either Jobseeker’s
Allowance or Jobseeker’s Benefit. When you apply for a jobseeker’s payment you
declare that you are available for work, fit for work, looking for work but
can't find work. This is also known as _signing on_ .
