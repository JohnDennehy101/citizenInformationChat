###  What are ‘provided items’?

‘Provided items’ are any item held by the Adoption Authority or Tusla, which
was provided by a relevant parent, carer or other family member for the
purpose of being made available to another relevant person on request. The
item could be a letter, photograph, memento or other document or object. It
could have been provided historically, or it could be an item which was lodged
through the Contact Preference Register.
