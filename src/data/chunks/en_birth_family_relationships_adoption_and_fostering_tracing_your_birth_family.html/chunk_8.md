###  Where a preference for contact is registered

If you register a preference for contact, and the Adoption Authority
identifies a match, the Adoption Authority or Tusla will contact you. You will
both be given the option to use a mediation service if you wish.

If you register a preference for contact and there is no match on the CPR, you
may wish to begin a trace yourself. Visit [ birthinfo.ie for tracing
application forms ](https://www.birthinfo.ie/what-options-do-i-have/apply-for-
a-tracing-service) .
