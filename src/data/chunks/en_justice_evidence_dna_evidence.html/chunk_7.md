##  What is the DNA database used for?

The database can only be used for its intended purposes, for example, only
certain indexes can be compared in certain circumstances.

Your DNA profile will only be logged on the database if:

  * You are detained for a relevant offence. A relevant offence is one that has a maximum sentence of 5 years or more (see [ Section 9 of the 2014 Act ](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2014/act/11/section/9/enacted/en/html#sec9) ). 
  * You are an offender or a former offender. An offender in this case is someone who is serving a sentence for a relevant offence, while a former offender is someone who served a sentence for a relevant offence and has been released in the last 10 years. 
  * You are a volunteer. A volunteer may be someone else involved in a case, for example, the victim. 
  * Your DNA profile was generated under the 1990 Act. These DNA profiles were added to the database, unless they were due to be destroyed.
