###  DNA evidence in court

DNA evidence is always explained by an expert witness when it is introduced in
court. The expert tells the court how often that DNA profile is found in the
general population. For example, the expert may tell the court that this DNA
profile is found in approximately 1 in every 1,000,000 people.
