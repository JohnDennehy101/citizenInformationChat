##  Custody

Custody refers to the day-to-day care, residency and upbringing of children
who are regarded as _dependent children_ . In custody matters, dependent
children are children who are under the age of 18. In cases of [ judicial
separation ](/en/birth-family-relationships/separation-and-divorce/judicial-
separation/) or [ divorce ](/en/birth-family-relationships/separation-and-
divorce/divorce-decrees/) , one parent is usually granted custody. The
children live permanently with the parent who has custody and the other parent
is granted access to the children at agreed times (which can include overnight
access). Read more about access below.

It is possible for parents to continue having joint custody of their children
after separation or divorce and for the children to spend an equal amount of
time with each parent, if the parents can agree and arrange this.
