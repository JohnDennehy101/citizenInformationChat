##  Child maintenance

There is a legal responsibility on parents, whether married or unmarried, to
maintain dependent children in accordance with their means. A dependent child
is a child who is under the age of 18, or 23 if they are in full-time
education. Maintenance can be paid periodically (for example, weekly,
fortnightly or monthly) or in a lump sum. Paying maintenance does not give a
parent access or guardianship rights.

Child maintenance can be a private arrangement between you and the other
parent, or if you can't come to an agreement, either person can apply to the
court for a maintenance order.

You can bring an application for maintenance either in the [ District Court
](/en/justice/courts-system/district-court/) or [ Circuit Court
](/en/justice/courts-system/circuit-court/) (or, in exceptional cases, in the
[ High Court ](/en/justice/courts-system/high-court/) ).
