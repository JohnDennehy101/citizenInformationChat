##  Guardianship

Guardianship is where parents have the legal responsibility to make decisions
on behalf of their child and perform duties in relation to their child's
upbringing. Married parents are automatically joint guardians of their
children. Neither separation nor divorce changes this.

However, a father who is not married to the mother of his child does not have
automatic guardianship rights in relation to that child. You can read more
