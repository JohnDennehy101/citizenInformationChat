##  Introduction

The breakdown of a marriage or relationship can be a difficult and traumatic
process, particularly where children are involved. It changes the family
structure and can reduce the daily presence and availability of one parent. It
is important to support your childrenâ€™s well-being and rights throughout the
process, to help them adjust to the separation or divorce.

Some children will need extra support to deal with the emotional impact of the
change and sense of loss. Parents and children dealing with relationship
breakdown can get support from:

  * [ One Family ](https://onefamily.ie/)
  * [ Treoir ](https://www.treoir.ie/)
  * [ Rainbows Ireland ](https://www.rainbowsireland.ie/)
  * [ Barnardos ](https://www.barnardos.ie/)
  * [ Childline ](https://www.childline.ie/)
  * [ ISPCC ](https://www.ispcc.ie/)
  * [ Family Mediation Service ](https://www.legalaidboard.ie/en/our-services/family-mediation/)

If you have decided to separate or divorce and children are involved, you will
need to consider certain issues such as guardianship, custody, access and
child maintenance.
