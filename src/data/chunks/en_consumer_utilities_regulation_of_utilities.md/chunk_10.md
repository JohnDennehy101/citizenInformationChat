##  How does the CRU protect customers?

The CRU has a role to make sure energy customers are protected and to promote
competition. It does this by putting in place a rulebook called the [ Supplier
Handbook ](https://mk0cruiefjep6wj7niq.kinstacdn.com/wp-
content/uploads/2017/09/CER17060-Electricity-and-Gas-Suppliers-Handbook.pdf) .
This requires suppliers to have [ codes of practices
](https://www.cru.ie/home/customer-care/energy/customer-protection/#supplier-
codes-of-practice) saying how they will deal with consumers. These codes cover
the following areas:

  * Billing 
  * Disconnections 
  * Customer sign-up 
  * Marketing and advertising 
  * Complaints handling 
  * Vulnerable customers 
  * Pay-as-you-go (PAYG) and budget controllers 
  * Non-domestic customers 

Suppliers must have Customer Charters in place setting out:

  * Guaranteed service levels for customers 
  * Compensation and refund arrangements when service quality levels are not met 

Every supplier must put its customer charter and codes on its website. You can
