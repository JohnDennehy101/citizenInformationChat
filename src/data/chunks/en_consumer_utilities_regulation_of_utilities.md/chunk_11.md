##  How to make a complaint

If you have a problem, you should first contact either:

  * Your electricity supplier for issues around billing, account problems, marketing or advertising, or changing supplier, or 
  * ESB Networks for problems including a faulty meter, connection costs, emergencies, outages, or connection delays 

If you have an issue with Uisce Ã‰ireann (previously called Irish Water), you
should first make a complaint with them through their [ complaint handling
section ](https://www.water.ie/contact-us/domestic-
account/general/complaints/) .

If you cannot resolve the issue, you have the following options:

  * Contact the CRU for information and advice, or to use its [ complaint resolution service ](https://www.cru.ie/home/complaint-form/energy/log-complaint-cru/)
  * Take a claim against the company through the courts using the [ Small Claims Procedure ](/en/justice/courts-system/small-claims-court/)
