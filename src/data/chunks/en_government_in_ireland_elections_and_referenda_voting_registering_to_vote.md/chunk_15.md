##  Student voters

If you are studying away from home while attending college, you can register
at either your home address or your student residential address.

You must be registered at **one address only.**

If you live away from the address at which you are registered, you will need
to update the register.

If you leave your address but you plan to return there within 18 months, you
can continue to be registered there, as long you do not register at any other
address.

Students can register to vote by post if they are currently registered, but
unable to go to their polling station because they are studying away from
home. To register to vote by post, complete [ form PV4
](https://www.checktheregister.ie/en-IE/forms) and send it to the local
authority in the area where you want to vote. See 'Postal Voters and Special
Voters lists' above for more information.
