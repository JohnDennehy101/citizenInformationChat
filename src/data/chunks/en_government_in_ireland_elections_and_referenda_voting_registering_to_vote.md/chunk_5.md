###  Deadline for registering to vote

Your application must be received by the local authority at least 15 days
before an election or referendum (excluding Sundays, Good Friday and public
holidays). If it is received on or after 14 days before an election or
referendum is taking place, you will not be registered to vote in that
election or referendum.
