##  How to register to vote

Each local authority is legally obliged to maintain, update and publish its
Register of Electors. The Register must be maintained and updated on an
ongoing basis.

To be eligible for inclusion in the Register of Electors, you must:

  * Be at least 18 years old 
  * Be ordinarily resident at an address in Ireland 

If you are homeless or have no address, you can still register to vote by
stating that you have ‘no fixed address.’ Read more about being [ homeless and
registering to vote ](/en/government-in-ireland/elections-and-
referenda/voting/homeless-and-registering-to-voting/) .

If you have more than one address, you should give the address where you want
to be registered. You can only be registered at one address.

You can register to vote:

  * Online at [ checktheregister.ie ](https://www.checktheregister.ie/en-IE/)
  * By [ filling in an application form ](https://www.checktheregister.ie/en-IE/forms)

If you do not give a PPS number, you must get your form and ID witnessed at a
local Garda station.
