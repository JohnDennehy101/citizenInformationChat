###  Voting by post

Most voters have to vote in person at an official voting centre. However, you
may be eligible for a postal vote if you are:

  * An Irish diplomat posted abroad, or their spouse or civil partner who is living abroad with them 
  * A whole-time member of the Defence Forces 

You may also be eligible for a postal vote if you cannot go to a polling
station because:

  * You [ have an illness or disability ](/en/government-in-ireland/elections-and-referenda/voting/facilities-for-voters-with-disabilities/)
  * You are studying full time at an educational institution in Ireland, which is away from the home address where you are registered 
  * You cannot vote at your local polling station because of your occupation, service or employment 
  * You are unable to vote at your polling station because you are in prison as a result of an order of a court 
  * You are a member of the Garda Síochána 
  * You are registered as an anonymous elector, or you are part of the household of an anonymous elector 

People who are eligible to vote by post are registered on the Postal Voters
list. The latest date for receipt of applications is:

  * 2 days after the date of dissolution of the Dáil in the case of a general election 
  * 2 days after the date of the order appointing polling day in the case of a Dáil bye-election 
  * 22 days (excluding Sundays and public holidays) before polling day for other elections or referendums
