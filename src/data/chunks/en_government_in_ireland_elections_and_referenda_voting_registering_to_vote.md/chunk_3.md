###  Changes to the registration system

You can now register to vote for the first time and update the register
throughout the year. If you provide your PPS number, you do not need to have
your identification and forms witnessed at a Garda station. Applications to
register and to change the register can be made online at [
checktheregister.ie ](https://www.checktheregister.ie/en-IE/) .

If you are already registered, you should check your details and add your PPS
number, date of birth and your Eircode on [ checktheregister.ie
](https://www.checktheregister.ie/en-IE/) . Everyone is being asked to do this
to keep the register up to date.
