##  Overseas voters

If you are an Irish citizen living abroad, you cannot be added to the Register
of Electors unless you are an Irish official on duty abroad (or their spouse
or civil partner).

In its [ fifth report in 2013
](http://www.constitutionalconvention.ie/AttachmentDownload.ashx?mid=bf489ec7-9556-e311-8571-005056a32ee4)
, the Convention on the Constitution recommended that Irish citizens resident
outside the State should have the right to vote in presidential elections.
This would require a [ referendum ](/en/government-in-ireland/elections-and-
