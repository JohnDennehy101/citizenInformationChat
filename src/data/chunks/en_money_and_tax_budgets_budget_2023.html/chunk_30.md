###  Employees

**Income tax rates** will stay the same (at 20% and 40%), but there will be
increases to tax credits and changes to the income tax bands for 2023.

The **standard rate tax band** (the amount you can earn before you start to
pay the higher rate of tax) will be increased by €3,200 to €40,000 for a
single person and to €49,000 for married couples with one earner.

The following [ tax credits ](/en/money-and-tax/tax/income-tax-credits-and-
reliefs/introduction-to-income-tax-credits-and-reliefs/) will increase by €75
to €1,775:

  * Personal Tax Credit 
  * Employee Tax Credit 
  * Earned Income Tax Credit 

The ceiling for the 2% [ Universal Social Charge (USC) ](/en/money-and-
tax/tax/income-tax/universal-social-charge/) band will increase from €21,295
to €22,920 in line with the 80 cent per hour increase in the national minimum
wage from 1 January 2023. This ensures that full-time employees on the minimum
wage will remain outside the higher rates of USC.

The weekly income threshold for the higher rate of [ employer’s PRSI
](https://assets.gov.ie/235790/1f7aa00c-0978-46df-9576-4b51dd3826f7.pdf) will
increase from €410 to €441 to ensure that there is no incentive to reduce the
working hours for a full-time employee on the increased minimum wage from 1
January 2023.

The **Small Benefit Exemption** will increase from €500 to €1,000. Employers
can give 2 vouchers or gifts to employees each tax year. This increase will
also apply for the 2022 tax year.
