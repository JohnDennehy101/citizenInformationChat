##  Introduction

If you have an account with a credit institution and you make no transactions
on it for 15 years, it becomes a dormant account. Credit institutions include
banks, building societies and An Post.

Credit institutions must contact you if you have not made a transaction on
your account in 15 years or more. If the institution cannot contact you, the
money in the account will be transferred to the Dormant Accounts Fund.

[ Unclaimed life assurance policies ](/en/money-and-tax/personal-
finance/insurance/unclaimed-life-insurance-policies/) can also be transferred
to the Fund.

If your money is transferred to the fund, your rights are not affected and you
can always [ reclaim the money
](dormant_bank_accounts_in_ireland.en.html#l5326d) (including interest). If an
account holder has died, the rights of their heirs are not affected.

Amounts in dormant accounts are paid into the Dormant Accounts Fund.

If someone dies without [ making a will ](/en/death/before-a-death/making-a-
will/) and their relatives cannot be found, the State is the ultimate
beneficiary of their estate. The proceeds of sale of property and any other
assets are placed in an Intestate Estates Fund Deposit Account, which may also
be paid into the Dormant Accounts Fund.
