###  Who pays for the cost of return?

You are responsible for returning the product to the seller. The seller does
not have to refund you for return postage costs. Some sellers will cover the
return costs but it depends on the sellerâ€™s return policy. The seller must
tell you before you bought the product whether you will have to pay the return
postage costs yourself.

If the seller did not tell you beforehand that you would be responsible for
the return costs, then you can claim the costs back.
