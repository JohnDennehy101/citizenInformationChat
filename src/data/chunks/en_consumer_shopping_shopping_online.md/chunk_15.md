##  Your rights when an order is delayed or not delivered

The seller must deliver your product to you either:

  * Within 30 days of buying them (unless you agreed a different date) 
  * On the date you agreed with them 

If the seller does not deliver the product as agreed in the contract or within
30 days, you can request a new delivery date.

You can insist that all items you bought in the one transaction are delivered
at once. The seller cannot make you accept deliveries in instalments.

You can end the contract if:

  * The seller cannot or refuses to deliver within the new time frame you request 
  * A new delivery date is no longer suitable for you, for example, you needed the product for a specific date or event 

You must tell the business you are using your right to end your contract for
non-delivery. The business must give you a refund within 14 days.
