##  Open category

Open category refers to drone flights which are deemed to be a low risk.

Drones in the open category must weigh less than 25 kilograms and have one of
the class identification marks 0, 1, 2, 3 or 4. Drones bought before 1 January
2023 are not required to have a class identification mark.

You can fly an ‘open’ category drone (weighing under 25 kilograms) without
permission, as long as:

  * The drone is no more than 120 metres above the level of the land or water directly below 
  * The drone is not outside your line of sight 
  * The drone is not on or near certain exempted zones such as around hospitals and aerodromes 
  * Your capacity to operate the drone is not affected by the consumption of alcohol or illness. 

There are restrictions in place on:

  * Whether and to what extent you can fly over or near uninvolved people or crowds 
  * Whether you can fly it in urban areas 

The restrictions depend on which subcategory the drone falls into and what
class identification mark it has.

Your drone cannot carry dangerous goods or release any objects.
