##  What is a drone or UAS?

Drones, or Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS), are remotely piloted flying crafts
that a person on land controls with a remote.

Drones vary in size and weight and can come fitted with features such as
cameras or sensors.

If you own or use a drone in Ireland, various laws and rules apply to you,
regardless of whether you use the drone for educational, scientific, or
recreational purposes.

The law on drones also applies to other types of aircraft without a pilot on
board. This includes certain radio-controlled flying models.

If you fly a drone in Ireland that weighs more than 250 grams or has a camera
or sensor, then you must [ register as a drone operator
](https://www.iaa.ie/general-aviation/drones/drone-register) with the Irish
Aviation Authority.

A person may not operate a drone in a manner that may be hazardous to other
aircraft, or that may endanger life or result in damage to property.
