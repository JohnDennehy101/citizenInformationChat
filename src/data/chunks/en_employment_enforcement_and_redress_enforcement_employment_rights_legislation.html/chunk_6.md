###  What can inspectors do?

Inspectors have powers under the law.

Inspectors can:

  * Enter premises at reasonable times 
  * Interview employers and employees 
  * Take statements 
  * Examine and take copies of records 
  * Begin legal proceedings 

If an initial inspection of records finds that you have breached employment
law, the WRC Inspection Services have several options.

They can:

  * Issue a letter asking you to correct this 
  * Refer the matter to legal services for prosecution 
  * Carry out a further inspection 

Inspectors can work in Joint Investigation Units with both Revenue and the
Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection. They can also exchange
information with these bodies.
