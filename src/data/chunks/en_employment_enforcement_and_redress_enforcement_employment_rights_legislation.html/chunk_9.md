###  Prosecutions

The WRC can bring [ summary prosecutions ](/en/justice/criminal-law/criminal-
trial/disclosure-in-criminal-cases/) against employers accused of breaking the
law.

If you are convicted of an offence, you must pay the WRC the cost of expenses
to investigate, detect and prosecute the offence. This is the case unless the
court decide there are valid reasons why you do not have to cover these costs.

This is set out in the [ Workplace Relations Act 2015
](https://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2015/act/16/enacted/en/html) .
