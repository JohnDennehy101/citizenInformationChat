###  How will I know if I am due an inspection?

Usually, you will be told beforehand.

If there is a valid reason why the inspection cannot take place on the
proposed date, you must contact the inspector as soon as possible to arrange a
different date.

In certain situations, the inspector may also call without advance notice. For
example, unannounced out of hours inspections to ensure that [ young people
are not working outside the hours allowed ](/en/employment/starting-work-and-
changing-job/young-people-at-work/working-hours-rest-breaks-young-people/) .

If necessary, inspectors may be accompanied by other inspectors or the Garda√≠.
They can also apply to the [ District Court ](/en/justice/courts-
system/district-court/) for search warrants.
