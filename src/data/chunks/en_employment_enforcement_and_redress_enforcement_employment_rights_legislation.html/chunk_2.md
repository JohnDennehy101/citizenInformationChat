##  Who enforces employment law?

Employment conditions are monitored by the [ Workplace Relations Commission
(WRC) ](/en/employment/enforcement-and-redress/workplace-relations-
commission/) to make sure employers are following employment-rights
legislation.

If you are an employer, you must make sure that your employment records are up
to date and are available for inspection, as required by law.

See the [ WRCâ€™s guide to inspections (pdf)
](https://www.workplacerelations.ie/en/Publications_Forms/Employers_Guide_to_Inspections.pdf)
.

This page is written for employers dealing with WRC inspections.
