####  Separate representation for the child

The court must make all decisions on the basis that the welfare of the child
is of greatest importance. With this in mind, the court may order that the
child be joined as a party to the care proceedings. This means that the child
has separate legal representation, paid for by Tusla. If the child is not a
party to the proceedings, the court may appoint an independent person to
inform the court of the wishes and interests of the child. This person is
called a _guardian ad litem_ in legal terminology.
