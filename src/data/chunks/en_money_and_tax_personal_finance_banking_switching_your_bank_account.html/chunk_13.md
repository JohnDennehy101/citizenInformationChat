##  If you need extra support

You may need extra support to change your bank account. For example, if you:

  * Have difficulty communicating 
  * Are not able to visit a branch or open an account online 
  * Need help making decisions 
  * Have difficulty providing the required documents 

You can contact the additional support help line for your bank:

  * AIB: 0818 227 056 
  * Bank of Ireland: 1800 946 146 
  * permanent tsb: 0818 818 721 

If you prefer, you can call into your local branch for help. You can bring a
trusted friend or relative with you if you find it helpful.
