####  The rules your old bank and new bank must follow

The Central Bank of Ireland has a [ Code of Conduct on the Switching of
Payment Accounts with Payment Service Providers (pdf)
](https://www.centralbank.ie/docs/default-source/Regulation/consumer-
protection/other-codes-of-conduct/45-gns-4-2-7-code-of-conduct-o.pdf) that
banks must follow. The Switching Code is designed to make it easier for you to
switch accounts.

Under the Code, banks must provide you with a switching pack. This contains a
description of the current accounts available, as well as a step-by-step guide
to what you need to do when switching.

Your new bank must have your new account up and running within 10 days of the
agreed switching date.
