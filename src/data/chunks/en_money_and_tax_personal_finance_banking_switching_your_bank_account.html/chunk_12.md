##  If something goes wrong with the switch

Both your old and new bank must meet the standards and deadlines set out in
the Switching Code.

If you are not happy with the switch or something goes wrong, first [ make a
complaint ](/en/consumer/how-to-complain/complain-about-financial-services/)
directly to the bank. Banks must have a complaints process in place and there
are timelines for dealing with your complaint.

If, after following the complaints process, you are still not satisfied with
the response, you can refer your complaint to the [ Financial Services and
Pensions Ombudsman (FSPO) ](https://www.fspo.ie/) .
