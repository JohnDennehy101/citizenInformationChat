###  Housing provided by approved housing bodies

[ Approved housing bodies (AHBs) ](/en/housing/local-authority-and-social-
housing/approved-housing-bodies/) are voluntary, independent, not-for-profit
organisations that provide housing in a similar way to local authorities. They
provide affordable rented housing for people who cannot afford to rent
privately or buy their own home. Some AHBs also provide housing specifically
for particular groups of people, such as older people. This supported or
sheltered housing is similar to the type provided by local authorities.
