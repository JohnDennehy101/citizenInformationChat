###  Moving to a more suitable home

If your home has become unsuitable or is now too big, you may want to move to
a smaller, more accessible home. If you are a homeowner you may decide to sell
your home privately and buy a more accessible home, for example, a bungalow or
ground-floor apartment.

If you are a local authority tenant you should contact the local authority to
let them know that your home is no longer suitable and to see what alternative
options are available.

The [ Age-Friendly Guide to Right-Sizing ](https://agefriendlyireland.ie/wp-

about moving to more suitable accommodation.
