##  What is social security?

A country’s social security system can provide you with a benefit or payment,
for example, if you are sick, unemployed, have children or retire.

Every year, Irish citizens leave Ireland to work, travel, study or retire
abroad. Many others who have been living, studying or working in Ireland also
leave to return to their home countries.

If you leave Ireland to live or work in another country, you may be able to
use your Irish social insurance contributions to qualify for social security
benefits in the country you are moving to. You can find more information about
the [ social security arrangements that Ireland has with other countries.
