###  International students and graduates

If you have permission to study in Ireland and have an IRP with Stamp 2, you
can work part-time (20 hours) during college terms and full time during
college holidays. You cannot work if you have an IRP with Stamp 2A.

The holiday periods are:

  * June, July and September 
  * From 15 December to 15 January 

If you graduate from an Irish college or university with a qualification at
level 8 or above (honours degree level or above), you may be able to apply for
the [ Third Level Graduate Scheme ](https://www.irishimmigration.ie/my-
situation-has-changed-since-i-arrived-in-ireland/third-level-graduate-
programme/) . You can get an IRP card with Stamp 1G which allows you to work
without an employment permit for the duration of the scheme.
