###  Non-EEA family members

If you are coming to Ireland to join a family member who already lives here,
or you are moving to Ireland with a family member who already has a right to
work in Ireland, you might not have to apply for an employment permit to work.
Different rules apply depending on the type of relationship you have with the
family member. For example, spouses generally have stronger rights to join
their husbands or wives in Ireland than other types of relationships.

  * [ Family members of EU/EEA citizens ](/en/moving-country/moving-to-ireland/rights-of-residence-in-ireland/residence-rights-eu-national/) can apply for a residence card under EU regulations. If the application is successful, you can get an Irish Residence Permit (IRP) with a Stamp 4EUFAM, which gives you the right to work without an employment permit. 
  * [ Family members of UK citizens ](/en/government-in-ireland/ireland-and-the-uk/residence-rules-UK-citizens/) who move to Ireland after 1 January 2021 can apply for residency and permission to work. 
  * [ Family members of people who have been granted refugee or subsidiary protection status ](/en/moving-country/asylum-seekers-and-refugees/refugee-status-and-leave-to-remain/family-reunification-for-refugees-in-ireland/) following an application for international protection can apply to come to Ireland through family reunification. If successful, you can get a Stamp 4 IRP which allows you to work without an employment permit. 
  * [ Family members of certain employment permit holders ](/en/moving-country/working-in-ireland/employment-permits/spousal-work-permit-scheme/) can get a Stamp 1G which allows you to work without an employment permit. 
  * [ Family members of Irish citizens ](/en/returning-to-ireland/residency-and-citizenship/returning-to-ireland-with-your-non-eea-spouse/) can apply for residence in Ireland. If successful, you will get a Stamp 4 IRP which allows you to work without an employment permit.
