##  Finding somewhere to live

You may find that the cost of living in Ireland is high. You should look at
accommodation websites like [ Daft.ie ](https://www.daft.ie/) and [ MyHome.ie
](https://www.myhome.ie/) to find out how much you will have to pay for rent,
and how much it costs to buy a place to live.

[ Social housing ](/en/housing/local-authority-and-social-housing/applying-
for-local-authority-housing/) is available, but it can take a long time to be
offered somewhere to live by a local authority or voluntary housing body.

Some people live outside of the main cities and commute to work.
