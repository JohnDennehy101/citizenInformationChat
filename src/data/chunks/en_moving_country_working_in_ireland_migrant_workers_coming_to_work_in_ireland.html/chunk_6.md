##  Immigration stamps and the right to work

If you are not from the EEA, Switzerland and the UK, you must have permission
to live in Ireland. To get permission to come to Ireland to work, you have to
[ apply for an employment permit ](/en/moving-country/working-in-
ireland/employment-permits/overview-employment-permits/) . In general, you
must get your employment permit before you come to Ireland. You can apply for
an employment permit when you have been offered a job. This means that you
have to find a job and then apply for an employment permit. When you have the
employment permit, you can [ apply for a visa to come to Ireland ](/en/moving-
country/visas-for-ireland/visa-requirements-for-entering-ireland/) (if you
need a visa).

Some people do not need an employment permit to work and can get permission to
work through the immigration system.
