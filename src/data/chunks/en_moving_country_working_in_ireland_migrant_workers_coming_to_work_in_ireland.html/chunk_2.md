##  Introduction

Citizens of the EEA (the EU, plus Iceland, Norway and Lichtenstein),
Switzerland and the UK, can live and work in Ireland without an employment
permit.

If you are from a country outside of the EEA, Switzerland and the UK, you need
permission to live and work in Ireland.

If you want to come to work in Ireland you may have to:

  * Apply for an [ employment permit ](/en/moving-country/working-in-ireland/employment-permits/overview-employment-permits/)
  * Apply for a [ visa to enter Ireland ](/en/moving-country/visas-for-ireland/visa-requirements-for-entering-ireland/)

Some people can work in Ireland without an employment permit.
