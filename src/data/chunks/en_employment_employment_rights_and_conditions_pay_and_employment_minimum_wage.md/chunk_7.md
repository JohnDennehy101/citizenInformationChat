###  **Pay reference period**

Your employer selects the period, known as the pay reference period, to
calculate the average hourly pay â€“ for example, a week, fortnight, or month
(but no longer than a month).

Your employer must include details of the pay reference period in your
statement of employment conditions, as set out in the [ Terms of Employment
(Information) Act 1994-2014 (as amended)
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1994/en/act/pub/0005/index.html) .

You can ask your employer for a written statement of your average rate of pay
for any pay reference period within the last 12 months. The employer has **4
weeks** to give you the statement.
