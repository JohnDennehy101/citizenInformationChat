###  **How is my hourly rate calculated?**

Your hourly rate is calculated by dividing your gross pay by the total number
of hours you have worked. This is set out in the National Minimum Wage Act
2000 [ Section 20
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2000/en/act/pub/0005/sec0020.html#partiii-
sec20) .

However, it must be clear:

  * What pay is included 
  * Which hours are included as working hours 
  * The pay reference period (whether you are paid weekly, fortnightly or monthly)
