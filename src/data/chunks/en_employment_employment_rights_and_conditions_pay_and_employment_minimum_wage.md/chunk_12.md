##  My employer cannot pay me the minimum wage

If your employer cannot afford to pay the minimum wage due to financial
difficulty, the Labour Court can give them permission, or _exempt_ them from
paying the minimum wage rate for between 3 months and one year. Only one
exemption is allowed.

The employer must apply to the Labour Court for the exemption, and they must
have the agreement of a majority of employees. The employer and the employees
must all agree to follow the decision of the Labour Court.

The employer must show that they are unable to pay the minimum wage and that
if they had to pay it, they would need to lay off or dismiss employees.

Employers can only be exempt from paying the full rate of the minimum wage.
They cannot be exempt from paying the reduced rate (for example, to employees
under 18).
