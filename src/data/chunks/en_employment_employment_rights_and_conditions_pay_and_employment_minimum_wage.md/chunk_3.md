###  Different rates of pay for certain sectors

Employees in certain sectors have other minimum rates of pay, for example, the
security and cleaning sectors. The rules for these sectors are set out in [
Employment agreements and orders ](/en/employment/employment-rights-and-
conditions/industrial-relations-and-trade-unions/employment-agreements-and-
orders/) made by [ Joint Labour Committees ](/en/employment/employment-rights-
and-conditions/industrial-relations-and-trade-unions/joint-labour-committees/)
.  
  
Even if the hourly pay rates are set out in an Employment Regulation Order
(ERO), an employer must pay their employees at least the legal minimum wage.
