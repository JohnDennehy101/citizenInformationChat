###  **Victimisation cases**

If you are alleging victimisation, you should ask your employer to bring back
your working conditions to how they were before the victimisation occurred.

If your employer does not do this within 2 weeks of you asking, you can refer
your case to the WRC adjudicator. You must do this within 6 months of the
alleged victimisation (which may be extended to a maximum of 12 months).
