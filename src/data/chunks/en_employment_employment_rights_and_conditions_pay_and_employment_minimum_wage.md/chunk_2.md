##  Introduction

Generally, the amount of pay you get for working is agreed between you and
your employer. Pay negotiations normally happen when you get a job offer.

However, most employees are entitled to a minimum wage under the [ National
Minimum Wage Act 2000
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2000/en/act/pub/0005/index.html) .

Since 1 January 2024, the national minimum wage is €12.70 per hour. Some
people get sub-minimum rates, such as people [ aged under 20
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/employment/starting-work-and-changing-
job/young-people-at-work/rights-of-young-workers/) (see the ‘Rates’ section
below).

The national minimum wage does not stop an employer from offering you a higher
wage. You cannot agree to be paid less than the minimum wage or to do unpaid
work unless you are employed by a close family relative or are on a [
recognised apprenticeship
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/education/further-education-and-
training/apprenticeships/) .
