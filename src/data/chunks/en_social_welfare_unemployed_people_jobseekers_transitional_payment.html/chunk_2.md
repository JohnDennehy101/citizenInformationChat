##  What is Jobseeker’s Transitional Payment?

Jobseeker’s Transitional Payment (JST) is a social welfare payment for people
who are parenting alone, whose youngest child is aged between 7 and 14.

JST is €232 per week, with an extra amount per child. You may get less than
this based on a means test.

You can get [ One Parent Family Payment ](/en/social-welfare/families-and-
children/one-parent-family-payment/) until your youngest child turns 7. After
this, you can apply for JST, but you should check if other payments are [ more
suited to your situation ](/en/social-welfare/families-and-children/moving-
from-ofp/) . JST is paid until your youngest child turns 14.

You don’t need to have been getting One Parent Family Payment to qualify for
JST.

The rules for getting JST are similar to One Parent Family Payment. Although
it is a jobseeker’s payment, many of the usual rules for [ Jobseeker’s
Allowance ](/en/social-welfare/unemployed-people/jobseekers-allowance/) do not
apply. However, you must engage with your local Intreo office when asked to do
so.
