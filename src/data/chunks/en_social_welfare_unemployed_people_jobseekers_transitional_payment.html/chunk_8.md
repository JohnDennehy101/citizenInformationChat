####  Maintenance

If you get maintenance for yourself, this is calculated as part of your means.
However, from 4 June 2024, child maintenance payments are not assessed in the
means test.

Up to â‚¬95.23 per week can be disregarded if you use it for housing costs. Half
of the remaining [ maintenance is then assessed ](/en/social-welfare/irish-
