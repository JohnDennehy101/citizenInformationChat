##  How do I apply?

You need to hire a registered forester to submit your application for you.
Check  
Gov.ie for a [ list of registered foresters and forestry companies
](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/205869-list-of-registered-foresters/) .

There are a number of steps involved in getting started on the scheme.

**1\. Contact a farm advisor**

Contact your local Teagasc advisor or farm advisor to discuss the scheme with
them. They will tell you if your land is suitable for planting a forest and
how this scheme will impact any other farming payments you are getting.

**2\. Contact a registered forester** **and apply for an afforestation
licence**

Contact a registered forester to help with your application and the process.

Your registered forester can submit your afforestation licence application,
which you need for this scheme.

You should contact several forester companies to find one that works for you.

After you choose your registered forester, you should sign a contract with
them and hire a solicitor.

**3\. Plan your forest and submit your application for technical approval**

Your registered forester submits your application for technical approval for
the Afforestation Scheme with you.

You may need to submit an environmental report or an Appropriate Assessment
Pre-Screening Report with the application.

At this stage, you need to decide if you want the forester to manage planting,
establishing and maintaining your forest for the first 4 years, or if you
would prefer to do it yourself.

You may also need to get an ecologist to do an ecological assessment and
report.

**4\. Apply for financial support and begin planting**

After you get written technical approval with an afforestation licence your
registered forester can apply for financial approval.

After you get financial approval, you can begin planting.

**5\. Get paid the grant**

The grant is split into 2 payments. You get the first payment after you plant
your trees.

You get your second payment after 4 years, when you have successfully
established your forest.

You need to apply to the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine for
each payment. The amount you get paid depends on the tree species you use and
the soil types.
