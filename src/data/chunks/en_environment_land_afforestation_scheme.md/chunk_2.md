##  What is the Afforestation Scheme?

The Afforestation Scheme provides financial support to encourage people to
develop and manage sustainable forests. You don't have to be a farmer to
apply.

The aim of the scheme is to increase Irelandâ€™s forest cover from 11% to 18% by
2027 to help counteract climate change. Planting trees is one way to reduce
the effects of climate change, as trees and forests absorb greenhouse gases.

The Afforestation Scheme runs from 2023 to 2027. Under the scheme, you can
plant different types of forests depending on the type of land you have. The
amount of money you get depends on the size and type of forest you plant.
