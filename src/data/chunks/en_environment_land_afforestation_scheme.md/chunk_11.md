##  Consultations, submissions and observations on afforestation licence
applications

When the Department gets an application for the Afforestation Scheme, they
post a public notice on their website. This includes the:

  * Application contract number 
  * Location of the proposed forest 
  * Size of the proposed forest 

Applications that need an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) may also have
notices of the application, the EIS and any other major information submitted
to local or national newspapers.

You can view forestry licences and applications using the [ Forestry Licence
Viewer ](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/a91f7-forestry-licence-viewer/) .
