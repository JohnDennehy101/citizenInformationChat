](https://assets.gov.ie/23796/961bbf5d975f4c88adc01a6fc5b4a7c4.pdf) . It
outlined a shared set of goals for children and young people from birth to 24
years, including to:

  * Be active and healthy, with positive physical and mental wellbeing 
  * Achieve their full potential in all areas of learning and development 
  * Be safe and protected from harm 
  * Have economic security and opportunity 
  * Be connected, respected and contributing to their world 

All Government departments, agencies, statutory services and the voluntary and
community sectors aimed to work towards these goals.

‘Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures’ was the first national policy framework
for children and young people in Ireland.

Due to COVID-19, a new national policy to succeed ‘Better Outcomes, Brighter
Futures’ has been delayed until 2022.
