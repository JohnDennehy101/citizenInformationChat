##  Can the owner take back the item?

The finance company can only repossess (take back) the item under certain
conditions:

  * If you are in arrears and have not yet paid off one-third of the total hire purchase cost, the owner can repossess the goods at any time without taking legal action against you. They must send you a _default notice_ first and give you at least 21 days to put things right, unless a court says they do not have to. 
  * If you have paid one-third or more off the total hire purchase cost, the owner cannot repossess the goods without taking legal action. 

Any deposit that you pay at the start of the agreement or the value of any
trade-in, for example, is taken into account in calculating one third of the
cost.

If this one-third rule is breached by the owner, you are entitled to end the
agreement and can ask for a refund of all payments made.
