##  Charges and fees

Hire purchase agreements may also involve additional fees and charges. These
fees and charges vary, but may include:

  * Documentation fees 
  * Penalty fees for missed or late payments 
  * Interest surcharge for missed repayments 
  * Completion fee for the transfer of ownership to you – sometimes you have to pay a _balloon payment_ much higher than your usual monthly payments 
  * Rescheduling charge – if your lender agrees to change the loan terms 
  * Other charges – you could be charged for repossession costs or for failure to take reasonable care 

A _balloon payment_ has the effect of postponing part of the costs until after
the loan. This means that in the earlier months and years, you are paying less
off your loan than you would for a bank or a [ credit union ](/en/money-and-
tax/personal-finance/banking/credit-unions/) loan. You must pay the balloon
payment to clear the loan and to become the legal owner.
