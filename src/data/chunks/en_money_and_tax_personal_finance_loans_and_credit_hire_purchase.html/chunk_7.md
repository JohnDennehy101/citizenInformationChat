##  Can I end a hire purchase agreement?

You can end the agreement at any time by giving notice in writing to the owner
of the goods (the finance company). This is a legal right under the Consumer
Credit Act 1995. You should be aware that breaking a hire purchase contract
before its normal end date usually involves penalties.

You have two options:

  1. **Buy the item earlier than planned.** You can own the item by paying the difference between the amount already paid and the total hire purchase price. There is usually a reduction on the overall amount due as you are paying the loan off earlier than planned. This reduction is calculated using a recognised formula for early loan repayments. However, the amount of any reduction is relatively small. 
  2. **Return the item to the owner and pay half the amount of the total hire purchase price** (if the total of instalments already paid have not reached that amount). This is called _the half-rule_ . You do not have to pay half the hire purchase price immediately. 

If you have not paid half the hire purchase price you can still return the
item. However, you will still owe the difference between the payments you have
made and half the hire purchase price.

If you have already paid more than half of the total hire purchase price:

  * You do not get a refund of the additional amount paid 
  * If you have missed any payments before ending the agreement, you still owe these arrears 

You may have to pay damages for failure to take reasonable care. The finance
company may issue a notice of costs, but you should try to get your own
estimate before handing back the goods. Take photographs of the goods before
handing them over. If you sign any paperwork, make sure it says ‘Statutory
Termination’ and not ‘Voluntary Surrender’ because different calculations will
usually be used to work out how much you owe.

Ending an agreement using the half rule may not always be the best solution. [
