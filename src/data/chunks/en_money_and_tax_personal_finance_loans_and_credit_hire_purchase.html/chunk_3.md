###  Personal Contract Plans (PCPs)

This is a specific type of hire purchase agreement offered by car dealers to
pay for a car. In a PCP contract, you pay a deposit and continue to make
regular instalments, usually over 3 years. There is usually a large lump sum
payment at the end of the contract.

At the end of the contract you can either:

  * Pay the final lump sum and keep the car, or 
  * Return the car to the seller (you can take out a new PCP arrangement on another car) 

You do not own the car until the final payment is made. You must stick to
certain restrictions on usage and maintenance, such as mileage limits and
servicing obligations.

PCPs can seem very attractive because they usually have very low monthly
repayments but they can be very complex compared to other types of car
finance. It is important to understand all the terms and conditions before you
sign up for a PCP. You can [ find out more about PCPs from the Competition and
Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC)
