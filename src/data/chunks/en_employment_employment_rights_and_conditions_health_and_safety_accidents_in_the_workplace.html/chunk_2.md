##  Introduction

Under health and safety laws, your employer has a duty to provide you with a
safe place to work.

If you have an accident while at work, you should:

  * Get medical help from your GP (family doctor) or a hospital, if needed 
  * Report the accident to your employer 
  * Check if you can get sick pay or other benefits
