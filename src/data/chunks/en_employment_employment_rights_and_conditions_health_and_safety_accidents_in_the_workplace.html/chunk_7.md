###  **Occupational Injuries Scheme**

The Occupational Injuries Scheme is a group of benefits if you are injured or
incapacitated by an accident at work or while travelling directly to or from
work.

  * [ Injury Benefit ](/en/social-welfare/disability-and-illness/injury-benefit/) is paid if you are unfit for work due to an accident at work or while you are travelling to or from work. 
  * Under the Medical Care Scheme you can claim certain medical costs that are not paid by the Health Service Executive (HSE) or covered by the Treatment Benefit Scheme. 
  * [ Disablement Benefit ](/en/social-welfare/disability-and-illness/disablement-benefit/) is paid if you lose certain physical or mental abilities because of an accident at work or while you are travelling to or from work. 

You can find out more about these and other payments under the [ Occupational
