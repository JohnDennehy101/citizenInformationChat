##  PRSI and tax if you are out of work

If you are out of work you may qualify for a [ credited contribution
](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/social-insurance-
prsi/credited-social-insurance-contributions/) . A credited social insurance
contribution is a contribution given to you and recorded on your social
insurance record. Credit contributions are important because you may use them
to help you qualify for a social insurance payment.

You may also get a [ tax refund ](/en/money-and-tax/tax/income-tax/tax-refund-
when-unemployed-or-out-of-work-sick/) if you are out of work due to illness.
This will depend on the length of time you have been unemployed, the amount of
tax you have paid, the amount of tax credits you have used and the amount of
your weekly social welfare payment.
