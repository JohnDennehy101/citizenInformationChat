###  **Other social welfare payments**

You may get [ Illness Benefit
](http://www.welfare.ie/EN/Publications/SW119/Pages/1WhatisIllnessBenefit.aspx)
if you cannot work because you are sick or ill. You must be under 66, covered
by the appropriate class of [ social insurance (PRSI) ](/en/social-
welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/social-insurance-prsi/social-insurance/)
and satisfy the PRSI conditions.

If you do not have enough PRSI contributions, you may qualify for [ Disability
Allowance ](/en/social-welfare/disability-and-illness/disability-allowance/)
which is a means-tested payment. You may qualify if you have an injury,
disease or physical or mental disability that has continued or may be expected
to continue for at least one year.

If you donâ€™t qualify for Illness Benefit or Disability Allowance, you may be
entitled to the basic Supplementary Welfare Allowance. If you have returned to
work you can claim the basic [ Supplementary Welfare Allowance ](/en/social-
welfare/supplementary-welfare-schemes/supplementary-welfare-allow/) for up to
30 days while you are waiting for your pay.
