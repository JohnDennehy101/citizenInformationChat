###  **Personal injury claim**

You cannot claim compensation from your employer under the health and safety
legislation but you can make a personal injury claim through the [ Injuries
Resolution Board ](/en/justice/civil-law/injuries-resolution-board/) .

If either you or your employer rejects the Injuries Resolution Board
assessment, the Injuries Resolution Board may give you permission to bring a
claim through the [ civil courts ](/en/justice/civil-law/taking-and-appealing-
a-civil-case/) .
