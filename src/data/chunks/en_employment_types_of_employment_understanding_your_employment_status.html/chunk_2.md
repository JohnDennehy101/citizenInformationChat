##  What is employment status?

Your ‘employment status’ is either that:

  * You are an ‘employee’, or 
  * You are ‘self-employed’. 

You are usually an **employee** if:

  * Your employer controls how, when and where you work 
  * Your contract says you must do the work yourself and you cannot pass it on to someone else 
  * Your contract sets out specific work hours and amounts 
  * You are paid a fixed wage 
  * You pay tax through the PAYE (Pay As You Earn) system 

You are typically **self-employed** if you:

  * Own and control your business 
  * Bear the financial risk 
  * Can decide to do the work yourself, or hire someone else 
  * Can choose when and how you work and can refuse work offers 
  * Can work for multiple clients 
  * Pay tax through self-assessment
