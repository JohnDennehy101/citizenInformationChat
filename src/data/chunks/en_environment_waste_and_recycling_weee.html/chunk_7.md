###  **Recycling batteries**

Batteries should be disposed of carefully and not sent to landfill because
they are classed as hazardous waste.

You can return used batteries free of charge at:

  * Any local authority civic amenity site 
  * Any shop selling the same type of battery 

However, you can also bring them to a Blue Battery Box to be recycled. You can
find Blue Battery Boxes in:

  * Local recycling centres 
  * Newsagents 
  * Supermarkets 
  * Schools 
  * Workplaces 

Retailers must take back batteries of a type they supply, even if you did not
get the batteries from them. You do not have to buy anything from the shop
when you are depositing waste batteries.

However, retailers do not have to take back batteries of a type they do not
supply. For example, they do not have to take back a car battery if they only
sell batteries suitable for a torch or remote control.

Retailers do not have to accept contaminated waste that could be a health and
safety risk to their staff, such as leaking batteries.
