##  How is the WEEE recycling scheme funded?

Visible Environmental Management Costs (vEMCs) are standardised charges added
to the price of certain new items to help cover the costs of recycling them.

You will see a vEMC on the price display on all:

  * Refrigeration units 
  * Large household appliances 
  * TVs larger than 73cm 
  * Gas discharge lamps 
  * LEDs 

The retail price of the item includes the vEMC. The vEMCs displayed on the
goods you buy cannot be more than the actual costs of recycling them.

These charges fund:

  * WEEE Ireland 
  * European Recycling Platform 

These schemes ensure that all household WEEE is handled without causing harm
to the environment when it is returned to retailers or deposited at landfill
sites or civic amenity sites.

The rate is approved by the [ Producer Register Ltd
](https://www.producerregister.ie/what-we-do) , which is an industry-based but
independently managed national registration body.
