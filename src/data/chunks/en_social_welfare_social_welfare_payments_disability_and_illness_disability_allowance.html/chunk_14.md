###  Income from work

Some of your income from work is not taken into account. This includes self-
employed work.

You can work and earn up to €165 a week (after paying PRSI, pension
contributions and union dues) without your DA payment being affected.

If you earn more than €165 a week, 50% of your earnings between €165 and €375
will not be taken into account in the DA means test. Any earnings over €375
are assessed in full.

If you start work, you need to tell the Department of Social Protection (DSP)
and provide proof of your earnings, such as:

  * A [ payslip ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/employment/employment-rights-and-conditions/pay-and-employment/pay-slip/)
  * Your [ contract of employment ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/employment/employment-rights-and-conditions/contracts-of-employment/contract-of-employment/)
  * A letter from your employer.
