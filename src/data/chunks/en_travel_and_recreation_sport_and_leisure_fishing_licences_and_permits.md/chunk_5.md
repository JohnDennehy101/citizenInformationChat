###  Tagging and recording salmon catches

There is a system of tagging and recording the details of all commercial and
recreational salmon catches. Similar systems are used by Canada, France,
Spain, and the US. Tagging supplies valuable catch statistics and an estimate
of salmon stocks.

All salmon (and sea trout over 40cm) that are kept must be tagged and logged
in a logbook. You must return your completed logbook and any unused tags to
the IFI by 19 October each year. You should use the pre-printed envelope
supplied at the time of purchase. You must return your logbook and tags, even
if you did not catch any fish. Further information on the [ Salmon and Sea
Trout Tagging Scheme
](http://www.fishinginireland.info/salmon/salmontagging.htm) is available on
IFI's angling website [ fishinginireland.info
