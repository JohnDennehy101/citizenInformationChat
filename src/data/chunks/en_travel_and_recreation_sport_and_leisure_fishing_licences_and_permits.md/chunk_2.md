##  Introduction

Fishing for sport or recreation is known as angling. In Ireland, angling is
regulated by the government agency [ Inland Fisheries Ireland (IFI)
](http://www.fisheriesireland.ie/) . The main function of IFI is to advise the
Minister for Environment, Climate and Communications, about the conservation,
protection, management, development and improvement of inland fisheries and
sea angling. The IFI also ensures that national and local fisheries laws are
observed in both inland waterways and out to the 12-mile fishing limit off the
coast. It also ensures that Ireland's fisheries resources are protected and
conserved.

Angling is divided into the following categories:

  * [ Sea fishing ](http://www.fishinginireland.info/sea/index.htm)
  * [ Pike ](http://www.fishinginireland.info/pike/index.htm)
  * [ Salmon and sea trout ](http://www.fishinginireland.info/salmon/index.htm)
  * [ Coarse fishing ](http://www.fishinginireland.info/coarse/index.htm)
  * [ River trout ](http://www.fishinginireland.info/trout/index.htm)

Some species of fish are protected in Ireland including salmon, sea trout, sea
bass, molluscs, eels, and all freshwater fish. You must get a state licence to
fish for salmon or sea trout in Ireland.
