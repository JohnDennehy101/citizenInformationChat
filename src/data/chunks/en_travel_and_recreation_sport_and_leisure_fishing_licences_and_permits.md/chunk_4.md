###  Protection of resources

Inland Fisheries Ireland, the [ Irish Naval Service
](https://www.military.ie/en/who-we-are/naval-service/) , the [ Aer Corps
](https://www.military.ie/en/who-we-are/air-corps/) and [ An Garda Síochána
](http://www.garda.ie/) are all involved in protecting Ireland’s inland and
sea fishery resources. These agencies have a national patrol plan that
coordinates protection and surveillance operations. They have a visible
presence in waters and powers to prosecute offenders (and confiscate illegal
nets, equipment, tackle and catch).
