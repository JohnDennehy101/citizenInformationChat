##  What covenants qualify for tax relief?

You can claim tax relief on a covenant to:

  * An adult who is permanently incapacitated 
  * A minor who is permanently incapacitated but is not your child 
  * Someone aged over 65 (this relief is limited to 5% of your total income) 

The exact tax saving depends on the:

  * Amount of tax paid by the covenantor 
  * Amount of the income of the covenantee 

To receive tax relief, a deed of covenant must last more than 6 years. Revenue
recommends that you make a covenant that lasts at least 7 years.
