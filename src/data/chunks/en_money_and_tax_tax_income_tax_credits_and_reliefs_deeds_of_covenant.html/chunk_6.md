##  What is the tax relief on a deed of covenant?

**If you make a payment** under a deed of covenant, you deduct tax on the
payment at the standard rate of 20% and send it Revenue.

The tax relief you get depends on your income and whether you pay the standard
20% rate of income tax or the higher 40% rate of income tax.

If you only pay the 20% rate of tax on your income, then there is no
difference between your 20% income tax and the 20% you deducted from the
payment. This means there is no benefit of tax relief.

If you pay the higher 40% rate of tax on your income, the tax relief you get
is the difference between the 40% you usually pay and the 20% you deducted
from the payment. So, you can get tax relief of 20%.

**If you get a payment** under a deed of covenant, tax has been deducted at
20%. If you have total income below the limit for paying income tax, you can
have this refunded to you. Your total income includes the covenant payments
you get plus any other source of income.
