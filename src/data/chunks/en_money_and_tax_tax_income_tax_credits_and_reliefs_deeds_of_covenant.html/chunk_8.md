If you are the covenantor, the first time you claim relief you have to send
Revenue:

  * A copy of the deed of covenant 
  * A completed [ Form R185 (pdf) ](https://www.revenue.ie/en/self-assessment-and-self-employment/documents/form-r185.pdf)

For following years, complete Form R185 after each payment date and send it to
your [ Revenue office ](https://www.revenue.ie/en/contact-us/index.aspx) .

If you are a PAYE employee, you can either:

  * Claim the relief online by using [ myAccount ](https://www.ros.ie/myaccount-web/home.html) to make a tax return or 
  * Complete the [ Claim form for Deed of Covenant (pdf) ](https://www.revenue.ie/en/self-assessment-and-self-employment/documents/claim-form-deed-of-covenant.pdf) and send it to your Revenue office 

If you are [ self-assessed ](http://www.revenue.ie/en/business/self-
