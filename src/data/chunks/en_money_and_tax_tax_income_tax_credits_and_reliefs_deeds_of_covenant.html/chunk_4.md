##  How to make a deed of covenant

You can make a covenant by completing the [ Deed of Covenant Form for
Individuals (pdf) ](https://www.revenue.ie/en/self-assessment-and-self-
employment/documents/deed-of-covenant.pdf) . You can also ask a professional
adviser such as a solicitor or accountant to make a deed.

The deed must be properly drawn up, signed, witnessed, sealed and delivered to
the covenantee.

If you are the covenantee, you must have a [ PPS number ](/en/social-
welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/personal-public-service-number/) .

If you are the covenantor, you must not get any benefit (either directly or
indirectly) in return for paying the agreed amount.

A deed must last for more than 6 years. It is only effective from the date it
is made and cannot be backdated.
