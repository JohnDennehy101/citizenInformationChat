##  Accident and Emergency Departments of public hospitals

Most public hospitals provide accident and emergency services. Anybody in
Ireland with a medical emergency is entitled to attend their Accident and
Emergency Departments. You may have to pay [ charges for public hospital
services ](/en/health/health-services/gp-and-hospital-services/hospital-
charges/) .

People attending the Accident and Emergency Department of a public hospital
are prioritised on the basis of medical need. You may be required to wait for
treatment if you have a non-urgent injury or illness.

Some hospitals have [ injury units for minor injuries
](https://www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/3/injuryunits/) that are unlikely to
require admission to hospital.

Some private hospitals and clinics offer emergency services. You will be
charged the full cost of care in private facilities.
