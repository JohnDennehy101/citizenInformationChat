##  Ambulance services

In the public health service, the National Ambulance Service provides
ambulance services for transporting seriously ill people to hospitals or
between hospitals. The Dublin Fire Brigade provides an emergency ambulance
service for the greater Dublin area.

These ambulance services are free, and you will not be charged by the National
Ambulance Service or the Dublin Fire Brigade.

You can contact emergency ambulance services by telephoning 999 or 112. (The
112 number applies throughout the EU). All calls are free.

If you are being brought to or from non-urgent healthcare, other vehicles may
be used if appropriate (for example taxis or minibuses). The Intermediate Care
Service provides vehicles for transport of patients between hospitals and
other medical facilities to ensure emergency ambulances are available to
respond to emergencies.

If you are using a private ambulance service, including air ambulance services
you will have to pay for their services. This may happen if you are
transferred to a private hospital. If you have private health insurance this
may help pay for some of the cost of the private ambulance.

There are also a number of volunteer ambulance organisations. They are
generally used to provide immediate assistance at public events.

The [ Pre-Hospital Emergency Care Council ](https://www.phecit.ie/) is the
national body with responsibility for the professional regulation of ambulance
personnel and for education and training in the area of pre-hospital emergency
care in Ireland.
