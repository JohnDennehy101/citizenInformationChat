##  Entitlement of visitors to Ireland to emergency health services

If you are a national of a member state of the European Union (EU), European
Economic Area (EEA), Switzerland or the UK and you are travelling or staying
temporarily in Ireland, you are entitled to receive medical care if you become
ill or have an accident.

See [ Health services for visitors to Ireland ](/en/health/health-
system/health-services-and-visitors-to-ireland/) for further information.

There is a [ reciprocal agreement on medical treatment for temporary visitors
between Ireland and Australia ](https://www.gov.ie/en/press-
release/0e0e58-reciprocal-agreement-on-medical-treatment-for-temporary-
visitors-bet/) . Under the agreement, Australian visitors who access emergency
public treatment pay the [ hospital charges ](/en/health/health-services/gp-
and-hospital-services/hospital-charges/) that apply to people who are
ordinarily resident in Ireland. If you are on a temporary visit to Ireland and
are not covered under EU regulations, you will have to pay the cost of
attendance at an Accident and Emergency Department. If you are not a national
of an EU/EEA member state, or from Switzerland or Australia, you may also be
charged the full economic cost of any further treatment, including medical
care in an acute hospital. Therefore taking out private medical travel
insurance before travelling is recommended.
