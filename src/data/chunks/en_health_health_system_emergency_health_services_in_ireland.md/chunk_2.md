##  Introduction

Emergency health services in Ireland provide medical attention for illnesses
or injuries requiring immediate treatment. Typical examples of injuries that
may require emergency health services include those resulting from accidents,
heart attacks or other sudden illnesses.

Emergency health services are usually delivered by a general practitioner
(GP), ambulance personnel or by attendance at the Accident and Emergency
Department of an acute hospital.

The Department of Health has overall responsibility for policy on accident and
emergency health services in Ireland. The Health Service Executive (HSE) has
responsibility for the delivery of public health emergency health services.
