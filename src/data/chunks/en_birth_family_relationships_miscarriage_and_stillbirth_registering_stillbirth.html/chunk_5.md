##  How to register a stillbirth

If you are the parent/s of a stillborn baby, you must register their
stillbirth by signing the Stillbirths Register at any [ Civil Registration
Service ](https://www2.hse.ie/services/births-deaths-and-marriages/contact-a-
civil-registration-service.html) . You will need to show photographic ID and
written evidence that the stillbirth occurred.

When you sign the Stillbirths Register, the registrar will give you a
stillbirth certificate. If you would like an additional stillbirth certificate
at a later date, you can [ order a stillbirth certificate online
](https://www2.hse.ie/services/births-deaths-and-marriages/get-
certificates/get-an-irish-stillbirth-certificate-online.html) from the HSE.

If your baby was stillborn in hospital, the hospital staff will help you to
complete a Birth Notification Form (Form BNF/01). If the stillbirth happened
at home, the midwife or doctor will do this.

The Birth Notification Form is completed with the baby’s:

  * Time, date and place of stillbirth 
  * Gender 
  * Weight and gestational age 
  * Personal Public Service number (PPSN) – this will be allocated at registration 
  * Forename(s) and surname 

The form also includes:

  * The mother's forename(s) and surname 
  * The mother's birth surname 
  * Previously used surnames of the mother (if any) 
  * The mother's normal occupation 
  * The mother's normal address at the date of birth 
  * The mother's date of birth 
  * The mother's civil status 
  * The mother's Personal Public Service number (PPSN) 
  * The birth surname of the mother's mother (the baby’s maternal grandmother’s birth surname) 

Similar information may be entered for the father.

When the form has been completed, it will be sent to a [ Civil Registration
Office ](https://www2.hse.ie/services/births-deaths-and-marriages/contact-a-
civil-registration-service.html) to tell the registrar of the stillbirth.

Then, you should attend a [ Civil Registration Service
](https://www2.hse.ie/services/births-deaths-and-marriages/contact-a-civil-
registration-service.html) in person and sign the Stillbirths Register.

You will need to bring photographic ID and written evidence of the stillbirth
(such as the signed medical certificate stating the weight and gestational
age) with you.

After you sign the Stillbirths Register, you will be given a stillbirth
certificate.
