###  Does the person being cared for have to live in our home?

If you care for a person who is not a relative, and not a relative of your
spouse or civil partner, then they do have to live in your home.

If the dependent person is a relative, they can be cared for outside your
home. However, if the person is not living with you they must live either

  * Next door in a neighbouring residence 
  * On the same property 
  * Within 2 kilometres of your home 

There must be a direct communication link between you (for example, telephone
or alarm system).
