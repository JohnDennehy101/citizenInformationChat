##  How to make a complaint

Firstly, you should complain directly to the medical professional or service.
Make your complaint face-to-face, over the phone or in writing.

Explain what your complaint is about and how you want it to be put right.

You can ask the service about its complaint’s procedure, or you can contact
the appropriate regulatory body. See ‘Taking your complaint further’ below.
