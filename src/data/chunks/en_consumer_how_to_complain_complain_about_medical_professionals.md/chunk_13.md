###  Counsellors and therapists

A [ registration board for counsellors and psychotherapists
](https://coru.ie/about-us/registration-boards/counsellors-and-
psychotherapists-registration-board/) is developing a registration and
regulation system. When this is established, complaints about counsellors and
psychotherapists will be investigated by [ CORU ](https://coru.ie/public-
protection/) .

The [ Irish Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy (IACP)
](https://iacp.ie/#cookie-dialog) promotes best practice and represents
counsellors and therapists. Counsellors and psychotherapists do not have to be
registered with the IACP.

You can [ make a complaint to IACP ](https://iacp.ie/complaints) about any
IACP accredited or pre-accredited member if you think there has been a breach
of [ the IACP Code of Ethics and Practice ](https://www.iacp.ie/iacp-code-of-
ethics) .
