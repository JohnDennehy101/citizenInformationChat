##  Private medical services

There are different bodies that regulate private medical services.

Medical professionals must be registered with the appropriate body to legally
practice in Ireland.

These regulatory bodies keep registers of professionals and can remove a
healthcare professional from the register if they are found guilty of serious
professional misconduct.

This page explains where to complain about medical services you have received
from a private medical professional, or where you think a medical professional
working in a public healthcare facility is guilty of professional misconduct.
