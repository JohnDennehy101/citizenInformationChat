###  Care needs assessment

The person you are caring for will need to complete a care needs assessment to
access many public health services. The assessment looks at a personâ€™s ability
to look after themselves safely, for example:

  * Personal hygiene 
  * Movement 
  * Preparing meals 
  * Cleaning and caring for their home 

They will then get a care plan which says what HSE services they need.
