##  Can I get a carer’s payment when I return to Ireland?

If you are returning to Ireland and caring for someone, you may be able to
claim a social welfare payment. You must be [ habitually resident
](/en/returning-to-ireland/applying-for-social-welfare/habitual-residence-
condition/) in Ireland to qualify for Carer’s Allowance.

The 2 main social welfare payments for carers providing full-time care are [
Carer’s Allowance ](/en/social-welfare/carers/carers-allowance/) and [ Carer’s
Benefit ](/en/social-welfare/carers/carers-benefit/) .
