####  Applying from home

If the person you are caring for is living at home, they can apply for home
support services themselves by sending a completed application form to their
local HSE Home Support Office. You can find the [ application form at the end
of the Home Support Information Booklet (pdf) ](https://www.hse.ie/eng/home-
support-services/apply-for-home-supports-services/home-support-services-
information-booklet-and-application-form-2018.pdf) .

If they are unable to apply themselves, someone can apply for them. This can
be their relative, family carer, GP or public health nurse. After the HSE
receives the completed application form, they will arrange a care needs
assessment.

Contact your [ local Home Support Office ](https://www.hse.ie/eng/home-
support-services/contact-your-local-home-support-office/) if you have any
questions about your application.
