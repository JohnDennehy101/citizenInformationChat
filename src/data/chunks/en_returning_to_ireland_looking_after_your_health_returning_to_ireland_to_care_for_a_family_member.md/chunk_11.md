###  Registering with a GP

You can [ find a GP in your local area ](https://www2.hse.ie/services/find-a-
gp/) on the HSE website. Sometimes GP practices have a full list of patients
and cannot take on new patients. In this case, you should go to another GP
practice in your area. You can transfer to the GP of your first choice at a
later date if they start taking on new patients again.

Some GPs provide services only to private patients. You usually have to pay to
see a GP as a private patient and fees can vary. You can see a GP free of
charge if you have a [ medical card or a GP visit card
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/health/medical_cards_and_gp_visit_cards/)
.

You do not need a PPS number or other documentation to visit a GP.
