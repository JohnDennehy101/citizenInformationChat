###  How does Neighbourhood Watch work?

There is no standard structure for a Neighbourhood Watch scheme. Every group
can set its own procedures and appoint or elect its own officers in a way that
suits them. However, most schemes involve:

  * An Area Coordinator 
  * A Street Coordinator 
  * A local Garda 
  * Young People 

In most cases, co-ordinators for the various streets and areas are appointed
at a public meeting following approval for the establishment of the scheme.
The co-ordinators are the main contact for members of the scheme. They also
receive and distribute information and recruit new members.

Co-ordinators can help set up other projects such as Property Marking or a
local Newsletter. The co-ordinators should hold meetings to discuss different
issues as they arise.

It is important to involve young people in Neighbourhood Watch. There are
successful crime prevention and community safety initiatives aimed at
Transition Year students. A number of Neighbourhood Watch schemes have
involved young people in sporting and environmental activities.
