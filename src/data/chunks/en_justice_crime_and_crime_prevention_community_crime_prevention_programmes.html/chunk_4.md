###  How to start a Neighbourhood Watch scheme

If you are interested in establishing a Neighbourhood Watch scheme in your
area, contact [ your local Garda Station ](https://www.garda.ie/en/Contact-
Us/) . The scheme may be set up in response to community demand or because of
Garda contact.

A Garda will tell you what has to be done and will help to organise your first
meeting. Before you set up a scheme, talk to local residents to see if they
will support it. It is important to make sure that everyone taking part
understands what the scheme is about.

Every community or neighbourhood, no matter how large or small, can set up a
scheme. A scheme can cover a single street, an apartment complex, or a part or
the whole of a housing estate.

You can find out more about how to set up a Neighbourhood Watch scheme on the
[ Garda SÃ­ochana website ](https://www.garda.ie/en/crime-prevention/community-
engagement/neighbourhood-watch.html) .
