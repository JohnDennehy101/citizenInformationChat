##  Text Alert

Text Alert enables communities to set up a group to receive alerts telling
them of suspicious or criminal activity in their area. Sending the information
by text means that information can be spread rapidly to a large amount of
people in a cost-effective way.

Text Alert is a one-way system and [ generally operates in the following
manner ](https://www.garda.ie/en/crime-prevention/community-crime-prevention-
programmes/text-alert.html) :

  * A member of the public reports an incident to [ the local 24-hour Garda District telephone number ](https://www.garda.ie/en/contact-us/station-directory/)
  * The reporting Garda investigates details of the reported incident and decides that the Text Alert system should be used 
  * The reporting Garda sends a text or e-mail out to each registered "Community Contact” in their Garda District 
  * Each "Community Contact” forwards the text to their "Community Group” to tell the public about the incident and to report any developments 
  * If the information is received by e-mail, the Community Contact may forward the e-mail or change the content to SMS Text and send to their Community Group
