When you have been accepted as eligible for DARE, you then compete for the
reduced point places based on your Leaving Certificate results.

A reduced point place means that you may get a place on a third-level course
with fewer than the full CAO points. For example, if you are eligible for DARE
and you get 350 Leaving Certificate points, you may be offered a place on a
course that requires 360 points through the standard CAO procedure. However,
you must meet the college matriculation requirements and any specific course
entry requirements.

Each of the third-level colleges participating in the scheme has reserved a
number of course places for school-leavers who are eligible for DARE. You can
find details of the places available through DARE on the [ websites of the
participating third-level colleges.
