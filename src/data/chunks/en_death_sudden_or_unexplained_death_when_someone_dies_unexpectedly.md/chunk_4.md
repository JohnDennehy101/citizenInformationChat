##  Release and registration

The body is normally released to the family immediately after the postmortem
examination has been completed. [ Funeral arrangements ](/en/death/practical-
arrangements-after-a-death/funeral-arrangements-and-costs/) should not be made
until the body is released or the Coroner has indicated when release will
occur. This is important at all times, but particularly on public holiday
weekends.

If there is a criminal investigation, it may be necessary to have a second
postmortem examination or further investigations. In this case, the release of
the body and the funeral arrangements may be delayed.
