##  Introduction

When someone dies, a doctor must be satisfied about the cause of death before
they can certify it and the [ death can be registered ](/en/death/practical-
arrangements-after-a-death/registering-a-death/) . If the doctor is not
satisfied about the cause of death or did not examine the deceased at least 28
days before the death occurred, the death must be reported to the [ Coroner
](/en/death/sudden-or-unexplained-death/coroners/) . The Coroner must also be
informed if the deceased died as the result of an accident, or in violent or
unexplained circumstances. The role of the Coroner is to investigate sudden
and unexplained deaths so that the death can be certified and then registered.

Generally the death is reported to the [ Garda√≠ ](/en/justice/law-
enforcement/garda-siochana-national-police-force/) , who inform the Coroner.
The Coroner then decides whether a [ postmortem examination
](/en/death/sudden-or-unexplained-death/postmortems/) (also called an autopsy)
is needed. A postmortem examination is a medical examination of the body
carried out by a specially trained doctor called a pathologist and usually
takes place in a hospital mortuary.
