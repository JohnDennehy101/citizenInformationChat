###  Registering the death

The death can only be registered by the [ Registrar of Births, Marriages and
Deaths ](/en/birth-family-relationships/getting-birth-marriage-or-death-
certificate/) when the Coroner has issued a Coronerâ€™s Certificate to the
Registrar. The Coroner will issue this after the postmortem report is received
or after an inquest is held. In the meantime the Coroner can issue an Interim
Death Certificate, on request, which is acceptable to the Department of Social
Protection for [ bereavement grants and other benefits ](/en/social-
welfare/death-related-benefits/) .
