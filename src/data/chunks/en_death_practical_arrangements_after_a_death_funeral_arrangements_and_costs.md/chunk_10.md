###  Burials

[ Burial grounds ](/en/death/practical-arrangements-after-a-death/burials-and-
burial-grounds/) (cemeteries) in Ireland are governed and maintained by local
authorities. The local authority usually appoints a registrar or caretaker for
each cemetery to manage the sale of plots in that site and in some cases to
maintain the burial ground.

Prices for grave plots and burials in Ireland can vary a lot, so check around
for prices, if possible.
