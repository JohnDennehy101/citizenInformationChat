##  Introduction

Funeral arrangements are usually made by the immediate family of the person
who died. The deceased person may have left specific instructions about the
funeral service they would like and where they would like to be buried or
cremated. Most people respect the deceasedâ€™s wishes where possible.

If there is disagreement about who should make the arrangements, the [
personal representatives of the deceased ](/en/death/the-deceaseds-
estate/what-happens-the-deceaseds-estate/) are entitled to make the decisions.
The personal representatives are the executors of the will (if there is a
will), or the people who are administering the estate if there is no will.

You can engage an undertaker or funeral director to deal with most aspects of
the funeral.
