##  What is Auto-enrolment?

Auto-enrolment is a new pension savings scheme for certain employees who are
not paying into a pension. They will be automatically included in the scheme
but can opt out after 6 months.

Auto-enrolment is expected to be introduced in January 2025. This page will be
updated as more detail becomes available.

Under the scheme, the employee, employer, and Government all pay a certain
amount into the employeeâ€™s pension fund.

A new public body, the National Automatic Enrolment Retirement Savings
Authority, will be set up to administer the Auto-enrolment scheme. The scheme
will be supervised by the [ Pensions Authority

finance/pensions/the-pensions-authority/) .

The rules for auto-enrolment are set out in the [ Automatic Enrolment
Retirement Savings System Act 2024
