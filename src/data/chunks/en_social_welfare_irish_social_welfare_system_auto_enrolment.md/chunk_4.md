###  **Does my employer have to participate?**

If your employer does not meet their [ auto-enrolment obligations
](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/576ac-automatic-enrolment-process-for-
pensions/?section=what-auto-enrolment-scheme-means-for-employers) , they will
be subject to penalties and possibly to prosecution. If they donâ€™t make
contributions on your behalf, they may be fined and have to make repayments
with interest.

However, there are no plans to force employers to contribute to personal
pensions.
