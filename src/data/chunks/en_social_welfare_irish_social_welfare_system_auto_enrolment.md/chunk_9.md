###  Opting out after a change in contribution rates

If you choose to leave the scheme in month 7 or 8 after a change in
contribution rates, you will get a refund.

This refund will be based on the difference between your own contributions at
the old and new rates during the previous 6 months.

This option is only available during the first 10 years of the auto-enrolment
scheme, as contribution rates gradually increase (see ‘How much do I pay?’
below). There will be 3 contribution rate changes.
