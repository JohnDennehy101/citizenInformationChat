###  What happens if I change jobs after being enrolled?

If you change jobs after being automatically enrolled, you won’t need to
change pension or join a new scheme. You will remain a member of the auto-
enrolment scheme on a ‘pot-follows-the-member’ basis. You won’t have to do
anything, as the new National Automatic Enrolment Retirement Savings Authority
will manage the change.
