###  Restrictions on ‘service charges’

Voluntary service charges are the same as a tip or a gratuity. Mandatory
service charges are charges that must be paid by the customer, on top of the
cost of the product or service.

Employers are banned from describing a mandatory service charge applied to a
customer’s bill as a 'service charge' unless the payment is treated by the
employer in the same way as electronic tips or gratuities.

This means that mandatory service charges can only be added to a bill if the
money goes to employees.
