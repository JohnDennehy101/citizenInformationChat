##  Informal Resolution

If you are dissatisfied or wish to complain, raise it with the person you are
dealing with. If possible, they will try to resolve it there and then.
However, they may need time to look into it. If this is the case they will
respond to your complaint with an outcome within 5 working days. If they canâ€™t
help they will explain why and, if you wish, you can follow the formal
complaints process below.
