##  Your rights as a consumer

When you hire someone to perform a service, you are making a contract. As
parties to the contract, you and the other party have certain legal rights and
obligations. If the person you hired does not do what they said they would
under a contract, they are in breach of the contract.

Consumer contracts in place before 1 November 2022 are protected by the Sale
of Goods and Supply of Services Act, 1980.

If you have a contract with a service supplier you can expect that:

  * The supplier has the necessary skill to provide the service 
  * The service will be provided with proper care and diligence 
  * The materials used will be sound 
  * Any goods supplied with the service will be of merchantable quality 

In a service contract, at the very least, make sure that you know the price of
the service and the time that it will take to complete the agreed work.
