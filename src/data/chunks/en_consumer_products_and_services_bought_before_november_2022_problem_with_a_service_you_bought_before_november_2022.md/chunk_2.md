##  Introduction

Many people offer services, these can be traders, tradesmen or professionals.
Here we use the term ‘service supplier’ to mean any person who supplies a
service as a business or part of a business.

This page explains your consumer rights if you bought a service on or before
28 November 2022.

You have different rights if you bought on or after 29 November 2022. This is
because the [ Consumer Rights Act 2022 (pdf)
](https://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2022/act/37/enacted/en/pdf) introduced
new rights when you [ buy services ](/en/consumer/buying-services/) .
