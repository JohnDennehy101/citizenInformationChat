###  Where to get more help

You can read more about [ how to make a complaint ](/en/consumer/how-to-
complain/how-to-make-a-complaint/) .

You can get advice and help from one of the trade and representative
organisations listed here. However, there are many service suppliers who are
not members of any trade or professional body.

If you have used the traders complaints procedure and the problem is still not
resolved, you can use the [ small claims procedure ](/en/justice/courts-
system/small-claims-court/) (for jobs less than €2,000) or [ taking a civil
case
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/justice/civil_law/taking_a_civil_case_intro.en.html)
(for claims over €2,000).

Check your home insurance policy to see whether it covers you for legal
expenses for contract disputes with service suppliers.

The Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC) can give you
information on [ your rights if you have problems with a service or a service
provider. ](https://www.ccpc.ie/consumers/contracts-and-services/hiring-
tradespeople/)
