##  The National Grant Scheme

The [ National Grant Scheme ](https://ageandopportunity.ie/active/age-and-
opportunity-active-national-grant-scheme/) for Sport and Physical Activity for
Older People is a government initiative aimed at encouraging older members of
the community to participate in sports and physical activity.

The scheme is aimed at:

  * Helping clubs and organisations to enhance existing opportunities for their members in recreational sports and activities. 
  * Helping clubs and organisations to progress new initiatives geared at involving older people in recreational sports and activities. 

Applications for funding under the National Grant Scheme are usually invited
from local clubs and organisations wishing to implement initiatives through
advertisements in the press and media.
