##  Social welfare payments and the BTEA

If you are getting a [ One-Parent Family Payment ](/en/social-
welfare/families-and-children/one-parent-family-payment/) , [ Jobseeker's
Transitional payment ](/en/social-welfare/unemployed-people/jobseekers-
transitional-payment/) or a disability payment ( [ Disability Allowance
](/en/social-welfare/disability-and-illness/disability-allowance/) , [
Invalidity Pension ](/en/social-welfare/disability-and-illness/invalidity-
pension/) or [ Illness Benefit ](/en/social-welfare/disability-and-
illness/illness-benefit/) ) you can choose to stay on your current social
welfare payment and apply for a student grant or you can choose to transfer to
the BTEA. You will need to assess whether it is more beneficial for you to
transfer to the BTEA when you go back to education or to remain on your
current payment and apply for a student grant. Further information on these
two options is set out below.

If you are getting [ Jobseeker’s Benefit ](/en/social-welfare/unemployed-
people/jobseekers-benefit/) or [ Jobseeker’s Allowance ](/en/social-
welfare/unemployed-people/jobseekers-allowance/) , you will no longer meet the
conditions of your payment if you go back to education (since you must be
available for and seeking work). This means that you _must_ transfer to the
BTEA if you wish to keep a social welfare payment when you go back to
education – see ‘People getting Jobseeker’s Allowance or Benefit’ below.
