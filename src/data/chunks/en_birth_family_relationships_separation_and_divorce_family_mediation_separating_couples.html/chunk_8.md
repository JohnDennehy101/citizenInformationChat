##  Parenting, children and mediation

The mediator can ensure that the voice of the child is heard during the
mediation process, helping to minimise any damage to the children caught in
the middle of parental disputes.

Parenting plans may be reviewed in light of the changing needs of the children
as they progress through school or teenage years. This can be facilitated by
the mediator at a later stage and can be written into the mediated agreement.
