##  What is mediation?

Mediation is a service to help couples in Ireland who have decided to [
separate ](/en/birth-family-relationships/separation-and-divorce/judicial-
separation/) or [ divorce ](/en/birth-family-relationships/separation-and-
divorce/divorce-decrees/) , or who have already separated, to come to
agreement in relation to decisions about the children, the family home,
finances and the future.

In mediation, a trained mediator helps you to negotiate your own terms of
agreement in a safe space, while addressing the needs and interests of all
involved. Mediation allows you and your ex-partner to make your own decisions,
rather than going to court and having a judge make them for you. Mediation can
be an effective, cheaper and quicker alternative to court.

**Mediation is not marriage counselling or a legal advice service.**
