##  The Youth Guarantee

The [ Youth Guarantee
](https://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?catId=1036&langId=en) aims to provide
young people under the age of 25 with a good quality offer of employment,
education, training or apprenticeship within a short time of leaving education
or becoming unemployed. It is an EU initiative developed in response to the
youth unemployment crisis.

In Ireland, the [ Guarantee was introduced on a phased basis (pdf)
](https://ec.europa.eu/social/BlobServlet?docId=13642&langId=en) . Aims under
the Guarantee include:

  * Young people under 18 who have left the school system without completing secondary education and who are unemployed will be given a ‘second chance’ education pathway such as Youthreach or will be supported to re-enter the school system. 
  * Young people aged 18-24 who have been unemployed for 4 months will get help to find work or will get an offer of quality training, education or work experience. 

Under the Youth Guarantee a range of initiatives are being put in place.

The qualifying period for [ JobsPlus (called JobsPlus Youth)
](/en/employment/unemployment-and-redundancy/employment-support-
schemes/jobsplus/) for jobseekers under 25 is 4 months. (It remains at 12
months for other jobseekers.) Eligible young people will be given
certification that they qualify for the JobsPlus subsidy and they can use this
when applying for jobs.

You can find more information about employment supports for young jobseekers
