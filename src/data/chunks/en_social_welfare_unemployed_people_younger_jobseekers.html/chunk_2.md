##  Introduction

Young people must meet the same [ conditions as other jobseekers ](/en/social-
welfare/unemployed-people/rules-for-getting-a-jobseekers-payment/) to get a
jobseeker's payment but you may need targeted supports to help you enter the
workforce. A Youth Guarantee was introduced (see below) to support all young
jobseekers and give you access to training, education, work experience or
full-time employment.
