##  Jobseeker's Allowance

If you have just left school you cannot get [ Jobseeker's Allowance
](/en/social-welfare/unemployed-people/jobseekers-allowance/) . To get
Jobseeker's Allowance you must have been out of school for 3 months and you
must be at least 18 years of age. The 3-month period starts from the day you
leave school or the day following your last exam if you are doing exams.

People aged under 25 who do not have children get a reduced rate of
Jobseeker's Allowance. If you take up a place on an education, training or
work experience scheme, you will get a higher rate of payment. You can visit
our pages on [ education and training options ](/en/social-welfare/back-to-
education/education-training-and-development-option/) and on [ employment
support schemes ](/en/employment/unemployment-and-redundancy/employment-
support-schemes/schemes-to-support-employment/) to get more information on the
rates paid.
