##  I am in rented accommodation

If you are a tenant in rented accommodation and you pay your landlord directly
for your electricity (rather than the electricity provider), your landlord
should pass the credit on to you.

If there is a dispute between you and your landlord, you should try to resolve
this informally. If you cannot come to an agreement, you can contact [ the
RTB’s free mediation service ](https://www.rtb.ie/dispute-resolution-
services/mediation) , where an independent mediator will help you reach an
agreement. Or, you can [ apply for ‘adjudication’ with the RTB
](https://www.rtb.ie/dispute-resolution-services/adjudication) , where an
independent adjudicator will look at all the evidence and make a decision
about your case.
