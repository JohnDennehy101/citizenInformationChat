##  I have a sub-metered account

In the past, households that had electricity supplied through a sub-meter were
not eligible for energy credits. This is where a property is divided with one
main meter and submeters linked to the primary MRPN (for example multi-unit
complexes).

Under a separate new scheme called the [ Submeter Support Scheme
](https://www.cru.ie/consumer-information/government-electricity-costs-
emergency-benefit-scheme-
faqs/#:~:text=I%20have%20a%20sub,your%20electricity%20supplier%20directly.) ,
electricity providers will also provide energy credits to consumers on
submeter accounts. Credits will be paid in 3 instalments of â‚¬150.
