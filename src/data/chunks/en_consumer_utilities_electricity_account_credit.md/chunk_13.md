##  What if I switched suppliers?

If you switch electricity supplier, you wonâ€™t receive the credit twice.

**You switch between 29 November and 31 December 2023** : The first credit
comes from the supplier you were with on 29 November 2023.

**You switch between 20 December 2023 and 29 February 2024** : The second
credit comes from the supplier you were with on 20 December 2023.

**You switch between 28 February and 31 March 2024** : The third credit comes
from the supplier you were with on 28 February 2024.

A supplier can apply the credit to your closing bill or credit you back
through the same method pay your bills.
