##  Part-time employees, zero-hour contracts and employment permits

You have certain employment rights if you are:

  * Working part-time 
  * Have a zero-hour contract, or 
  * Are working on an employment permit 

**Part-time employees**

A part-time employee is someone who works fewer hours than a comparable full-
time employee doing the same type of work.

If you work part-time, you can't be treated less favourably than a comparable
full-time employee unless it is justified, such as pension entitlements.

You can read more about the [ rights of part-time workers
](../../types_of_employment/part_time_workers.en.html) .

If you are in full-time employment, you do not have a statutory right to
change to part-time employment or to other flexible working patterns. However,
if you would prefer to work part-time, your employer should consider your
request.

**Zero-hour contracts**

A [ zero-hours contract ](/en/employment/employment-rights-and-
conditions/contracts-of-employment/zero-hours-contracts/) of employment is a
type of employment contract where you are available for work but do not have
specified hours of work. Zero-hours contracts are prohibited in most cases,
but there are some exceptions to this rule.

**Employment permits**

Foreign nationals working legally in Ireland are entitled to the same range of
statutory employment protections as Irish employees. To work in Ireland, most
non-EEA nationals must have an [ employment permit
