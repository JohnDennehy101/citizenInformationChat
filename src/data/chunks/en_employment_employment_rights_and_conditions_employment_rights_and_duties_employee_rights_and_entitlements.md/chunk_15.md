##  Right to disconnect

As well as your right to take breaks, you also have a right to disconnect from
work outside of normal working hours. This also applies to people [ working
from home ](/en/employment/employment-rights-and-conditions/health-and-
safety/working-at-home/) .

This is outlined in the [ code of practice on the right to disconnect
](https://www.workplacerelations.ie/en/what_you_should_know/codes_practice/code-
of-practice-for-employers-and-employees-on-the-right-to-disconnect.pdf) . It
gives guidance on your right to disengage from work outside normal working
hours.

While failure to follow the code is not an offence, it can be used as evidence
in a case taken to the Labour Court or Workplace Relations Commission (WRC)
under employment legislation.
