##  Making a complaint

If you have a complaint about your employment rights, you should:

  1. Speak to your employer directly and try to sort the issue informally. 
  2. If this doesn't work, you can make a formal complaint to the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC) using its [ online complaint form ](https://www.workplacerelations.ie/en/Complaints_Disputes/Refer_a_Dispute_Make_a_Complaint/) . 

Depending on your complaint, you may have to take ‘pre-complaint steps’, such
as gathering supporting documents and sending them to the WRC as part of the
complaint.

For example, if you are making a complaint under the National Minimum Wage
Act, you need to request a ‘statement of earnings’ from your employer before
making your complaint to the WRC.

You should make your complaint to the WRC **within 6 months** of the alleged
incident (dispute). This time limit can be extended by a further 6 months if
there was a reasonable cause for the delay.

Your complaint can be dealt with by _mediation_ or _adjudication_ .

**Mediation** : If both parties agree to mediation, a mediator will help you
reach a mutually acceptable agreement. This method often prevents complaints
from reaching the stage of a formal court hearing.

**Adjudication** : With adjudication, there is a public hearing, and an
adjudication officer will make a formal judgment.

If you are unhappy with the WRC’s decision, you can appeal it to the Labour
Court. In general, **appeals should be made within 42 days** . If you do not
appeal the decision within 42 days, it becomes legally binding and can be
enforced through the District Court.
