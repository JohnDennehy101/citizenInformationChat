All full-time employees are entitled to [ 10 public holidays
](/en/employment/employment-rights-and-conditions/leave-and-holidays/public-
holidays/) each year.

To qualify for pay on a public holiday or a paid day off, part-time employees
must have worked at least 40 hours in total during the 5 weeks ending on the
day before the public holiday.

If you must work on a public holiday, you are entitled to one of the following
(decided by your employer):

  * A paid day off on the public holiday 
  * A paid day off within a month of the public holiday 
  * An extra day’s annual leave 
  * An extra day’s pay 

If you work part-time and the public holiday falls on a day that you do not
normally work, you are entitled to one-fifth of your normal weekly wage for
the day.
