##  Introduction

If you want to use a bike on a public road in Ireland, your bike must be
fitted with reflectors and lights to ensure that other road users will see
you. All bicycles used on public roads must follow the [ Road Traffic
(Lighting of Vehicles) Regulations 1963
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1963/en/si/0189.html) as amended. This law
sets down the type of reflectors and lights that your bicycle must be fitted
with and when you must use them.
