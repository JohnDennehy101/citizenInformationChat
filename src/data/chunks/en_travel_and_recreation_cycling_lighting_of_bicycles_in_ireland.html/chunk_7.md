##  Does a Garda have a right to stop me if I cycle without lights?

Under [ Section 108 of the Road Traffic Act 1961 (as amended)
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1961/en/act/pub/0024/sec0108.html#zza24y1961s108)
, a member of the Gardai may demand your name, address and date of birth if
they suspect you have committed any crime or offence. They may also demand
your name, address, and date of birth if they suspect you have been involved
in a collision or caused injury to property or someone else. If you do not
give your name, address, or date of birth, or give a false name, address or
date of birth the Garda can keep your bicycle until they are satisfied with
your identity.
