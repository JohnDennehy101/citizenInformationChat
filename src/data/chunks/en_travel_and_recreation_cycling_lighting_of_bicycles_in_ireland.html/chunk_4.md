##  When do my bike lights have to be switched on?

Your bike lights must be switched on during _’lighting-up time‘_ . This period
begins half an hour after sunset and ends half an hour before sunrise on the
following morning. During these hours, all cyclists must have fitted (and make
use of) the following:

  * One front light, shows the front a white or yellow light visible for a reasonable distance 
  * One rear light, fitted to the rear of your bicycle showing a red light that is visible for a reasonable distance 

Lights do not need to be lit when stopped in traffic or when a person wheels
the bike on foot as near as possible to the left-hand edge of the road.
