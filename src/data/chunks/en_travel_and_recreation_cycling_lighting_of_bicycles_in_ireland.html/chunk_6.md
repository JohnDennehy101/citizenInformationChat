##  What is the penalty for not having bike lights?

Failure to use proper lighting on a bicycle is an offence. If you are stopped
by a member of the Gardai, the Garda may take your name and address, details
about your bike and the time and date of the offence. You may be issued a
fixed charge notice (See our page on [ Laws on cycling in Ireland
](/en/travel-and-recreation/cycling/cycling-offences/) for more information).
You could be summoned to appear in court, if you do not pay the fine.
