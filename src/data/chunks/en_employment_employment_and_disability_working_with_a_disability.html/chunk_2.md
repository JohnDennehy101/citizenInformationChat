##  Introduction

If you have a disability, there are supports to help you find and keep a job.

The new [ Work and Access ](/en/employment/employment-and-disability/work-and-
access-programme/) employment programme aims at reducing and removing barriers
disabled people may face at work. Some supports are for those already working,
while others help those who are unemployed.

As a person with a disability, you have the same [ employment rights
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/employment/employment_rights_and_conditions/)
as other employees.
