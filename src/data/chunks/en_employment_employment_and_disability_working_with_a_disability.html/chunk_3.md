##  Looking for work

If you are looking for a job for the first time or after taking a break, think
about your skills and how your disability might affect the type of work you
are applying for.

Many employers have equal opportunities policies and welcome applications from
qualified people with disabilities.

Understand your rights and what employers must do for you under equality
legislation. It is your choice to disclose your disability to potential
employers, especially if itâ€™s not visible, like a long-term illness or a
mental health issue. However, employers cannot accommodate your needs if they
are unaware of them.
