###  Capital Acquisition Tax

[ Capital Acquisitions Tax ](/en/money-and-tax/tax/capital-taxes/capital-
acquisitions-tax/) (CAT) is a tax on gifts or inheritances. Transfers between
spouses and civil partners are exempt from CAT.

If you get a gift or inheritance from a relative, it is tax free up to a
certain amount depending on the relationship.

If you get a gift or inheritance from your cohabitant, it is taxed in the same
way as if it was from someone who is not related to you. The lowest tax-free
threshold applies.

If your cohabiting partner dies when you are still in a relationship together,
you may be able to apply to court for a portion of their estate. A gift or
inheritance is exempt from CAT if it is made by court order in this way under
the [ redress scheme for cohabiting couples
