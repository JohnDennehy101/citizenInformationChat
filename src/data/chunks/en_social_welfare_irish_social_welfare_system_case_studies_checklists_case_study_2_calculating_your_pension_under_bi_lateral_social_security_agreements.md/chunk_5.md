####  **Step 1**

First, you must check whether Mary would qualify for an Irish State Pension
based on her Irish contributions alone.

You can calculate this by dividing the total number of contributions (600) by
the total number of years worked (34) since entering insurable employment.

**Yearly average number of contributions calculation** Mary’s Irish contributions  |  600   
---|---  
Total number of years worked*  |  34   
Yearly average number of contributions  |  600 ÷ 34 = 17.65 **(round up to 18)**  
  
* since entering into insurable employment to the end of the last complete tax year before reaching pension age 

Mary's yearly average number of contributions is 18. She would qualify for a
reduced Irish State Pension (Contributory) of €180.70 (in 2024).
