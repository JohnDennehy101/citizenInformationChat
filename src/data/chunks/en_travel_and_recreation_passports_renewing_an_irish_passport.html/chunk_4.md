through a participating photo provider like a pharmacy.

They can help you in one of 2 ways:

  * They can give you a unique code to include with your online application 
  * Ask them to email it to you, or save the photo on a USB device, or other storage methods. You must have access to the photo when completing your online application 

**Take the photo yourself**

  * Take a photo at home using a digital camera or smartphone. This cannot be a “selfie” and you should not use the zoom function of your camera. The photo must capture your image from the waist upwards.
