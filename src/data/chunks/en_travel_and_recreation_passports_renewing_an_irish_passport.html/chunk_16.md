###  Change of name

If you want to change the name on your passport to your married name, you must
submit your civil marriage certificate or civil partnership certificate.

If your previous passport was issued in your married name and you want your
new passport issued in your maiden name you must submit:

  * Your birth certificate 
  * Your judicial separation court order 
  * Your separation agreement or your divorce decree 

Otherwise, you will need to submit 2 official documents that show you have
been using your maiden name for 2 years.

If you have changed your name for another reason, you will have to submit
documents that show you have been continually using the name for at least 2
years.

If the name you are known by is the Irish version of your name but you do not
have proof that you have been continually using it for 2 years, 6 months’
usage may be accepted. If the proof of 6 months’ usage is accepted, the
English version of your name will also be noted on the passport.

If your documents are not in English you must also supply a certified English
version, translated by a [ registered translator
