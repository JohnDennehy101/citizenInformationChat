##  How long will my passport renewal take?

**Simple online** renewals take around **10** working days to process.

**Complex online** renewals take around **15** working days to process. A
complex renewal is when you are asked to submit [ extra documentation
](https://www.ireland.ie/en/dfa/passports/documentary-requirements/) or you
are changing information on your passport. You could be changing your name or
reporting a lost or stolen passport.

If you are applying **by post** , you should allow at least **8 weeks** for
your application to be processed (not including postage times). This period
may be extended at certain times of the year due to increased application
numbers.

Check the [ Passport Service website
](https://www.ireland.ie/en/dfa/passports/turnaround-times/) for current
processing times.
