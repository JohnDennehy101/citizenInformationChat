##  Grooming of children for criminal offences

The [ Criminal Justice (Engagement of Children in Criminal Activity) Bill 2023
](https://www.oireachtas.ie/en/bills/bill/2023/4/) was commenced on 23 May
2024. The Act now makes it an offence for an adult to:

  * Compel, coerce, direct or deceive a child for the purpose of engaging in criminal activity. 
  * Induce, invite, aid, abet, counsel or procure a child to engage in criminal activity 

The child concerned does not have to be successful in carrying out criminal
activity for this law to apply.

Only adults can be accused of these offences. A child who influences another
child to commit a crime cannot be charged under this legislation. This is to
avoid further criminalisation of children.

If you are found guilty of these offences, you may face a fine of up to â‚¬5,000
or imprisonment of up to 12 months or both on summary conviction, or a fine or
up to 5 years imprisonment or both on indictment.
