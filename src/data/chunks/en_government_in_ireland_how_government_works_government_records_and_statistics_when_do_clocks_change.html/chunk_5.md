##  Proposed changes to summer and winter time

In 2019, the [ European Parliament ](/en/government-in-ireland/european-
government/eu-institutions/european-parliament/) voted in favour of ending
these seasonal time changes. EU institutions have not made progress on
implementing the decision, and the [ European Commission ](/en/government-in-
ireland/european-government/eu-institutions/european-commission/) has said
that it does not plan to submit a new proposal on the matter to the
Parliament. This means that no changes are expected to summer and winter time
in the coming years.
