##  Making a complaint

You can complain to CORU about the fitness to practise of registered health
and social care professionals. This may include, for example, complaints of
professional misconduct or poor professional performance.

CORU can only look into events that have happened since 31 December 2014, when
it started accepting complaints.

If you want to make a complaint about a registered practitioner, complete
CORUâ€™s Fitness to Practise Complaint Form.

[ The Fitness to Practise complaint form, and further information on the
complaints process ](https://coru.ie/public-protection/fitness-to-
practise/about-fitness-to-practise/) , is available on the CORU website.

The Regulated Professions (Health and Social Care) (Amendment) Act 2020
introduced changes to the complaint system and added another ground for
complaint. You can [ read more on the CORU website. ](https://coru.ie/public-
