##  Life assurance and pensions

A cohabiting couple is a couple that lives together in an intimate and
committed relationship, who are not married to each other and not in a civil
partnership. Cohabiting couples can be opposite-sex or same-sex.

Your life insurance or pension policy in Ireland may provide for a lump sum,
or pension to be paid to a specified person on your death or retirement. In
this case, you may be able to nominate your cohabiting partner as the
beneficiary.

However, many policies specify that only a spouse or civil partner may
benefit. Where a policy specifies that only a spouse or civil partner may
benefit, your cohabiting partner will not have any entitlements.

Likewise, you may be entitled to a supplement to your pension in respect of a
spouse/civil partner, but not in respect of a cohabitee (your partner).

If you are a 'qualified cohabitant' under the [ Redress scheme for cohabiting
couples ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/birth-family-
relationships/problems-in-marriages-and-other-relationships/redress-scheme-
for-cohabiting-couples/) , you may apply for provision out of your partner's
estate if they die, but you will still have to pay Inheritance Tax on anything
you receive as a result of that application.

Check with your insurer or the trustees of your pension, or your life
insurance provider, if you want to be sure about the conditions of your
particular policy. If you are not married or in a civil partnership, you
should see if your policy can be changed to allow your partner entitlements
that they would not otherwise have.
