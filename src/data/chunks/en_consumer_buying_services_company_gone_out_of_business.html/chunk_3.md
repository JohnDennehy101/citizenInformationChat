##  General tips around businessclosures

If you cannot reach the company or you want to check if they have gone out of
business, check their name on the [ Companies Registrations Office (CRO)
](https://core.cro.ie/) . Information about companies based in the United
Kingdom can be found on [ Companies House
](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/companies-house) .

You can also:

  * **Visit the business premises or website** \- Check to see if a notice has been posted, giving you any more contact information. 
  * **Find out your options for cancelling payment** \- If you paid by credit card or debit card, contact your bank to see if charges can be reversed due to the goods and services not being received. This is known as _chargeback_ . 
  * **Research to see if the business is licensed or a member of an organisation** \- In some cases, you may be entitled to compensation. For example, if a licensed travel agency goes out of business and if the paid travel services were not provided, you may be eligible to claim under their insolvency protection.
