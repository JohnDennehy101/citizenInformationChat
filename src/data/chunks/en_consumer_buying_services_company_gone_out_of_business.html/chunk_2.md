##  Introduction

Businesses stop operating for a variety of reasons. If you find yourself
affected by a business closure, you may be unsure of your consumer rights.

The terms _going into_ _administration_ , _examinership_ , _liquidation_ or
_receivership_ are all terms used to describe where a company is at risk of,
or is, going out of business. Read more about [ closing or selling a business
](/en/employment/types-of-employment/self-employment/closing-a-business/) .

When a company closes down or has gone out of business, you could lose money
if:

  * You paid in full for a product that has not been delivered or a service that has not been provided 
  * You paid a deposit 
  * You bought a gift voucher or gift card that has not been used yet 
  * You bought a product that is faulty
