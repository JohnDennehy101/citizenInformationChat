##  What are my rights?

Whether you get your money back depends on the individual case. When a
business closes, common problems are:

  * The company has gone into liquidation of receivership 
  * There is a new owner 
  * You have an unused gift voucher or credit note 
  * You have paid a deposit but not received the goods or service 
  * Your goods are now faulty
