###  Choosing a contractor

Before choosing a contractor to do the work you should:

  * Ask friends, family, and neighbours who have done building work recently, for advice and recommendations on contractors 
  * Your local authority may have a list of contractors who work in your area 
  * Get a number of quotes and compare them 
  * Request and check the contractorâ€™s references 
  * Formalise your relationship with your contractor by drawing up a contract detailing the required works, prices, timescales, payment terms and warranties
