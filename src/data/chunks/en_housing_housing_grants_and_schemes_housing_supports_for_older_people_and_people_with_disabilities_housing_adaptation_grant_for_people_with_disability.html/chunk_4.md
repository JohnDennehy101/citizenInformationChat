##  How much is the grant?

The maximum grant you can get is €30,000 or 95% of the cost of the work
(whichever is less). The amount of money you get depends on your household
income for the previous tax year.

If your household income is less than €30,000, you may get 95% of the cost of
the works up to the maximum grant amount of €30,000.

If your house is less than 12 months old, the grant will not be more than
€14,500.

As household income increases, the percentage of the costs paid by the grant
gradually reduce from 95% to 30%. So, if you have a household income of
between €50,001 and €60,000, you will qualify for 30% of the costs.

You may not get the maximum grant, even if you qualify for it. This is because
the grant is paid by your local authority and depends on what funding they
have available. They will decide whether they can pay you the full grant, or a
percentage of the grant.

You will not get a grant if your gross annual household income is over
€60,000.
