##  Private cervical screening

If you want to have a HPV cervical screening test but you are not due to have
one, you can pay to have it done privately.

CervicalCheck will not have access to your private screening results, and the
private lab checking your sample will not have access to your CervicalCheck
screening history.

Private gynaecologists are not registered with CervicalCheck.
