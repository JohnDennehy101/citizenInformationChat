####  When can I book a cervical screening test?

If you are aged 25 to 29 years, you should be screened every 3 years.

If you are aged 30 to 65 years, you should be screened every 5 years.

Some people will need to be screened more often. If this applies to you,
CervicalCheck will write to you and let you know.
