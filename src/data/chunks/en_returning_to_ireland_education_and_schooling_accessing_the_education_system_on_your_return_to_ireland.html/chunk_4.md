###  Understand the Irish education system

The Irish education system includes [ primary school
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/education/primary-and-post-primary-
education/going-to-primary-school/starting-primary-school/) (sometimes called
national school) and [ post-primary school
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/education/primary-and-post-primary-
education/going-to-post-primary-school/starting-post-primary-school/)
(sometimes called secondary school). Your child must get a [ certain minimum
education from the age of 6 to 16
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/education/primary-and-post-primary-
education/attendance-and-discipline-in-schools/school-attendance/) , or until
they have completed 3 years of post-primary education.

You can enrol your child in infant classes in primary school from the age of
4, but this is not compulsory.

State-funded education is available at all levels unless you choose to send
your child to a private school. Many people continue after post-primary school
to [ further education
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/education/vocational_education_and_training/)
and [ third-level education
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/education/third_level_education/) .

There have been changes to the State examinations at post-primary school since
2014. The [ Junior Cycle Profile of Achievement (JCPA)
](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/a26b9-junior-cycle-profile-of-achievement-
jcpa/) is replacing the Junior Certificate. The change includes a classroom-
based assessment based on work completed during second and third year.

Some programmes available at [ senior cycle
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/education/primary-and-post-primary-
education/going-to-post-primary-school/senior-cycle/) may be new to you. These
include:

  * [ Transition Year ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/education/primary-and-post-primary-education/going-to-post-primary-school/transition-year/)
  * [ Leaving Certificate (also called the Established Leaving Certificate) ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/education/state-examinations/leaving-certificate/)
