##  Free pre-school education in Ireland

[ Pre-school education ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/education/pre-
school-education-and-childcare/) is usually provided by private childcare
providers, although there are financial state supports available.

Ireland has a State-funded pre-school scheme called the [ Early Childhood Care
and Education (ECCE) Scheme
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/education/pre-school-education-and-
childcare/early-childhood-care-and-education-scheme/) . Under the scheme,
participating centres and playschools provide a free service for a set number
of hours over a set period of weeks.

Children can start ECCE when they are 2 years and 8 months and continue until
they start primary school (provided they are not older than 5 years and 6
months at the end of the pre-school year). You can [ check if your child is
eligible for ECCE. ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/education/pre-
school-education-and-childcare/early-childhood-care-and-education-
scheme/#72c245)

You can also apply for the [ National Childcare Scheme
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/education/pre-school-education-and-
childcare/national-childcare-scheme/) . This is a childcare subsidy for
children aged between 6 months and 15 years (children aged 15 do not qualify).

Childcare costs vary widely across Ireland and are highest in urban areas like
Dublin and Cork. Read more about [ your childcare options
