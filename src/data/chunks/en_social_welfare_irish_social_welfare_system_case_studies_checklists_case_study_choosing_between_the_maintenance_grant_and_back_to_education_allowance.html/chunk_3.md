###  Anne has been getting Jobseeker’s Allowance for 9 months and is starting
a full-time course of further education at second level:

Anne cannot get Jobseeker’s Allowance (JA) and attend full-time education. She
should apply for the Back to Education Allowance (BTEA). Because Anne is over
25, her rate of payment on BTEA will be the same as the rate of Jobseeker’s
Allowance she is getting and she can keep any secondary benefits she is
currently getting. She will not get the maintenance component of a student
grant with BTEA, but she will be financially better off on BTEA than she would
be on the maintenance grant alone.

Since Anne is doing a Post-Leaving Certificate (PLC) course and getting the
BTEA she is exempt from the student participant charge (€200). She may have to
pay a course charge for books, exam fees and other costs.

If she was getting the BTEA for a third-level course she would have to apply
to SUSI to be assessed for the fee component of the student grant, covering
the student contribution and any tuition fees/essential field trip costs.
