##  Introduction

Jury service is when you are instructed to attend court with other members of
the public, so the court can select people to sit on juries for upcoming court
cases. Even though you are called for jury service, you may not actually serve
on a jury. If you are selected to serve on a jury, you and the other jurors
will hear the evidence in the case, and then decide if the accused person is
guilty of an offence. You have an obligation to attend for jury service if you
are called to do so. You will be contacted by summons of the County Registrar,
and the summons will state that you are obliged to attend for jury service on
a particular date.

Most criminal offences must be tried in front of [ trial by a judge and jury
](/en/justice/criminal-law/criminal-trial/criminal-trial/) . Juries are not
needed in most civil cases. However, there are exceptions, for example, some
defamation cases. Information on what jurors do is available in our document
on [ the role of a jury ](/en/justice/courtroom/jury/) .
