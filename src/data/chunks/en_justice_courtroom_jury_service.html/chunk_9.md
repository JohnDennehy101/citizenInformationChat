##  How is a jury selected?

Jurors are contacted by summons of the County Registrar. You must reply to the
jury summons. You can do this online by visiting [ jury.courts.ie
](https://jury.courts.ie/en/signin) or by using the QR code on the summons.
You can also reply by post using the form and pre-paid envelope provided.

If you have a right to be excused from jury service, you must state this when
you respond to the summons.

If you want to be excused for another reason (such as illness), you must state
that reason when you reply to the summons and enclose any certificates or
documents in support of your application. The County Registrar will decide if
you can be excused, or not.
