##  Rules

The Centenarian Bounty is paid to all Irish nationals and foreign nationals
resident in Ireland on their 100th birthday. Irish citizens born in the island
of Ireland who have reached 100 and are living outside the State are also
eligible for the Bounty.

The Bounty is not paid if a person reaches their 100th birthday but dies
before the application process completed. The Bounty cannot be paid to the
estate of a deceased person.
