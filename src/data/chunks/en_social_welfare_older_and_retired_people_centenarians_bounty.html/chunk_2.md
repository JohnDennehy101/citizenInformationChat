##  Introduction

The Centenarian Bounty is a national award made by the Irish president to
people who have reached 100 years of age.

The Centenarian Bounty is usually awarded on behalf of the President by a
local member of the clergy or friend of the centenarian. A letter of
congratulations signed by the President accompanies the award. The centenarian
can also request that the letter and the President's bounty be sent directly
to themselves without a presentation ceremony.

The President has also marks the birthday of each person resident in Ireland
over the age of 100 years. On their 101st and every birthday after that, the
person receives a special commemorative coin in a presentation box, along with
a congratulatory letter signed by the President. A new coin is designed for
each year.
