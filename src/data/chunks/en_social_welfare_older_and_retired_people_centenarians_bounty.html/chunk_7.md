###  People living in Ireland but not getting an Irish social welfare payment

You should forward information about people (Irish nationals and foreign
nationals) resident in Ireland who are not receiving a social welfare pension
to the Pensions Section in the Department of Social Protection. The Department
will arrange for a social welfare inspector to verify the information. This
may involve a visit by the inspector. Once it has been verified that the
person is eligible for the bounty, the award will be made to them.
