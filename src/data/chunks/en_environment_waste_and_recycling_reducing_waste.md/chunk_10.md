###  Make a weekly meal plan and shopping list

Plan out what food you will need for the week and make a shopping list. Check
the recipes of meals you plan to make. Your shopping list should only have
items on it that you will need and use. Take a photo of the contents of your
fridge to remind you. Stick to the list as much as possible and avoid impulse
buying.
