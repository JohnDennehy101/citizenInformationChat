##  Why should I reduce waste?

Ireland is working towards having a [ circular economy
](https://www.mywaste.ie/the-circular-economy/) . A circular economy aims to
eliminate waste and our reliance on natural resources, by encouraging us to
keep products and materials in use. This reduces greenhouse gases, saves
energy and creates jobs. By reducing the amount of waste you create, you help
prevent pollution and protect the environment. You also limit the amount of
waste going to landfill, preserve natural resources and save money.
