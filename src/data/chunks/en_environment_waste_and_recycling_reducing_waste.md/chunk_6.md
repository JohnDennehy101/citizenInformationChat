###  Avoid single-use plastics

[ Single-use plastics (SUPs) ](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/ef24a-single-
use-plastics/) are items that are used once, or for a short period of time,
and then thrown away. For example, straws, cotton bud sticks and polystyrene
food containers.

You should avoid using SUPs as they take a long time to break down and can
damage the environment, particularly oceans. 70% of marine litter in the EU
comes from SUPs.

Since 3 July 2021, certain SUPs are [ banned from the Irish market
](https://www.mywaste.ie/news/single-use-plastics/) .
