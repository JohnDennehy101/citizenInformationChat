###  Printing

Reduce paper waste by promoting environmentally friendly printing practices.
For example:

  * Put a ‘think before you print’ sticker on the printer 
  * Make ‘print both sides’ the default setting 
  * Use refillable toner cartridges 
  * Have a paper recycling bin within arm's reach of the printer
