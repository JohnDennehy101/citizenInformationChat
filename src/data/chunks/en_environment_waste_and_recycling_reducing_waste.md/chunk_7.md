###  Buy second hand

Buying second hand products will save you money. It also decreases the demand
for new items, which preserves natural resources. Cars, clothes, exercise
equipment, furniture and books are all examples of items that can be bought
and used second hand.

If you have items that you donâ€™t want, instead of throwing them out, you could
[ donate them to a charity shop ](https://www.icsa.ie/resources/how-charity-
shops-work/) . You could also donate or sell them through buy and sell
websites or social media groups.
