###  Recycle, reuse, repair

Recycling is the process of collecting waste and turning it into other
materials or objects that can be reused. When we recycle, we use less raw
materials than when producing a new product, which reduces air pollution and
improves the environment.  Recycling household waste  can also reduce the
amount you spend on waste collection, as many waste collectors have no
restriction on the amount of waste you can put in your green and brown bins.
But, there are generally thresholds for the amount you can put in your black
bin, and excess charges apply if you go above this. You can also take your
recyclable waste to a recycling facility to be recycled. Find out more about [

The best way to reduce waste is not to produce it in the first place. So,
reuse items whenever possible. For example, instead of buying plastic bottles
of water, use a reusable bottle and refill it at home or at a free drinking
water tap. If youâ€™re going shopping, bring your own reusable shopping bags.

Instead of buying new items, try and repair the ones you have. For example,
you could repair your clothes, furniture, bike or appliances. Information on
how to fix most things is available on the internet. Or, you can get a local
professional to fix your items.

Another option is upcycling. This is reusing items you no longer want, to make
new products or materials of a higher value. It can be a fun and creative way
of reducing waste and breathing new life into old items.
