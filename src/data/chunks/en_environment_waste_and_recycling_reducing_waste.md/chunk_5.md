###  Avoid food packaging

When you’re in the supermarket, avoid buying items with excessive plastic
packaging. In some supermarkets, you may be able to leave unwanted packaging
behind.

Choose fruit and vegetables that don’t come prepackaged and bring your own bag
to carry them home. Choose food items that come in recyclable containers.
