##  Prohibition against refoulement

It is against international law to return a person to a country where there is
a serious risk that the person will be tortured or subjected to other inhuman
or degrading treatment or punishment. This is known as the principle of _non-
refoulement_ .

This principle is absolute, which means that it applies regardless of the
legal status, history or circumstances of the person involved

In Irish law, the principle against non-refoulement is set out in [ Section 50
of the International Protection Act 2015
](https://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2015/act/66/section/50/enacted/en/html#sec50)
