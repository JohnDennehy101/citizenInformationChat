##  Safe country of origin

Under the [ International Protection Act 2015
](https://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2015/act/66/enacted/en/html) , the
Minister for Justice can declare that a country is a safe country of origin.
This means that the Minister has declared that there is generally no
persecution, no torture or inhuman or degrading treatment, or no threat of
violence from an armed conflict in that country.

The following countries have been declared safe countries of origin:

  * Albania 
  * Algeria 
  * Botswana 
  * Bosnia and Herzegovina 
  * Brazil 
  * Egypt 
  * Georgia 
  * India 
  * Kosovo 
  * Malawi 
  * Morocco 
  * Montenegro 
  * North Macedonia 
  * Serbia 
  * South Africa 

You may still apply for international protection if you are from a safe
country of origin, if you can submit serious grounds that the country is not
safe in terms of your circumstances.
