###  Outside of country of nationality

If a person has no citizenship (is stateless), the country of ‘habitual
residence’ is used. This is the country where the person normally lives.

Where a person is a citizen of more than one country, the authorities who are
examining the application can assess if the applicant can live in any of the
countries where they are a citizen.
