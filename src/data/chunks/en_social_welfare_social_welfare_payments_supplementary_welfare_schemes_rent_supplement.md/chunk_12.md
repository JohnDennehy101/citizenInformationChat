##  How much is Rent Supplement?

Rent Supplement is paid to you weekly or monthly by Electronic Fund Transfer,
post draft or cheque, usually in arrears.

The amount of Rent Supplement that is calculated will generally ensure that
your income, after paying rent, does not fall below a minimum level. This
level is the basic Supplementary Welfare Allowance rate for your circumstances
minus the appropriate rate of Household Contribution (see above). However, you
may pay more depending on your means - see 'How to qualify for Rent
Supplement' above.

The rent paid to your landlord (that is, your contribution plus your Rent
Supplement) should not be above the maximum rent limit set for your county or
area (this provision can be waived in some circumstances). The maximum rent
limit for your county is set by the Department of Social Protection (DSP).
However, the DSP may set **lower rates** within these limits. If your actual
rent is higher than the local maximum, you may be refused Rent Supplement
entirely.
