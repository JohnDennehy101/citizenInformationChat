##  Other rules for Rent Supplement

Rent Supplement will only be provided if the accommodation is suitable for
your needs. Rent Supplement is not generally paid if the rent is above the
maximum rent limit set for your county (see ‘How much is Rent Supplement’
below for information about these limits and situations where they may be
waived).

**You must also:**

  * Pass a [ habitual residence test ](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/social-assistance-payments/habitual-residence-condition/)
  * Pass a means test 

**You won’t qualify for Rent Supplement if you:**

  * Are leaving local authority housing without reasonable cause 
  * Have been excluded from social housing by a local authority for reasons of good estate management or anti-social behaviour 
  * Are registered as a full-time student. However, if you are getting a [ Back to Education Allowance (BTEA) ](/en/social-welfare/back-to-education/back-to-education-allowance/) or are participating in the [ Back to Education Programme ](/en/social-welfare/back-to-education/back-to-education-programme/) you may be entitled to Rent Supplement 
  * You are getting a Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) 

**Renting from a parent:** You cannot get Rent Supplement to help you pay rent
to your parent if you are living in the family home. If your parent owns a
second property, you will generally not get Rent Supplement for this property
unless you can prove that you are a genuine (bona fide) tenant.

**Sharing with your landlord:** You may be entitled to get Rent Supplement if
[ you are living in your landlord’s home ](/en/housing/renting-a-home/tenants-
rights-and-responsibilities/sharing-accommodation-with-your-landlord/) . It
must be a genuine landlord/tenant arrangement. Your landlord has to fill in
part of the form and provide their PPS number (see 'How to apply' below).
