##  How to apply for Rent Supplement

Rent Supplement Application packs are available in Intreo Centres or Branch
Offices. You can also [ request a pack online
](https://www.eforms.gov.ie/en/forms/5) . Each pack contains detailed
information (including a list of documentation you will need) and all the
relevant application forms.

To apply, fill in an [ application form for Rent Supplement (pdf).
](https://assets.gov.ie/42214/d5508c17df7344beb8dde444cc0a02b4.pdf) The CWO or
local Citizens Information Centre (CIC) can help you fill in this form.

Part of the form will need to be filled in by your landlord or their agent.
Your landlord will need to provide their tax reference number (normally their
PPS number) to the DSP. If your landlord does not wish to fill in the form a
separate form [ (SWA 3C) (pdf)
](https://assets.gov.ie/21788/3468ca3f2aba4a6f99f8397d7699cd63.pdf) is
available. If your landlord does not have a tax reference number, they should
state this in writing to the DSP and explain why this is the case. Your Rent
Supplement may not be paid if your landlord has not given their tax number to
the DSP or has not explained why they do not have one.

You will need show proof of your identity, income and tenancy. Some of the
documents you may need are:

  * Identity documents for you and your dependants, such as full birth certificates, passports, driving licence, work permit, Irish Residence Permit (IRP), etc. 
  * Documents to show your income and financial situation, such as, pay slips, [ tax statements ](/en/employment/employment-rights-and-conditions/pay-and-employment/employment-detail-summary/) , bank statements, etc.
