###  **Rent limits**

You can find [ the rent limits for Rent Supplement on the Department's website
](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/79fdae-maximum-rent-limits/) . Note that
the DSP may set lower rates within these limits.

[ SI 221/07 ](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2007/en/si/0221.html) sets down
that the maximum amounts of Rent Supplement payable for tenants. For voluntary
housing developments funded through the Capital Assistance Scheme, the rates
are €55 for a single person and €60 for other household compositions. The
rules established for your expected contribution towards your rent are set
above.

For cases where the rent expected is above the relevant maximum limit, the
Department’s NTSF policy, as outlined above, is to provide a flexible case-by-
case approach, providing additional financial support to ensure that people
qualifying for Rent Supplement keep their accommodation.
