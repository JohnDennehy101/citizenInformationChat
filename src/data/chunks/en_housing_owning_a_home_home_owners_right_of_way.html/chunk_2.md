##  What is a right of way?

A right of way allows you to travel over land that belongs to someone else.
There are 2 types of right of way, a public right of way and a private right
of way.

There may be limits on how you can use a right of way. For example, you may
only be allowed to walk or cycle over certain rights of way, while you may be
allowed to drive over others. Some rights of way can have certain conditions,
such as closing a gate after you use it.
