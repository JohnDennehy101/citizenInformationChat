##  Rules

As a witness, you can only give evidence about facts within your own personal
knowledge. You cannot testify about what somebody else saw or heard.

You cannot give evidence about your opinion. Your testimony must be a
statement of the facts. It cannot contain any assumptions you have made, or
conclusions you have drawn from those facts. The exception to this rule is the
[ expert witness ](/en/justice/witnesses/types-of-witnesses/) who can give
evidence that is their opinion.

You cannot give evidence about what someone else said. This is known as the [
hearsay rule ](/en/justice/evidence/hearsay-evidence/) . For example, you
cannot give evidence that your mother told you she saw the accused grab your
purse. In that case your mother would need to give evidence in court to say
that she saw the accused grab your purse.

You cannot give evidence about previous statements you have made. For example,
you cannot give evidence that you told your friend that the accused grabbed
your purse. You can only give evidence about the actual incident. However, if
you are giving evidence as a victim of rape, you can introduce evidence that
you made a complaint after the rape.

Your main duty as a witness is to tell the court the truth. If you knowingly
make a false statement under oath, you may have committed the crime of
"perjury" and you can be prosecuted.
