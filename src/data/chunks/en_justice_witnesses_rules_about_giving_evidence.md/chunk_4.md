###  Right to refuse to answer a question

If you are giving evidence (either during the examination or the cross-
examination), and you do not want to answer a question, you must let the judge
know that you are not prepared to answer the question and why.

There are very few circumstances where a judge will allow you to refuse to
answer a question if it is relevant to the case. The right to refuse is known
as a [ privilege ](/en/justice/evidence/privileged-evidence/) . Privilege
applies in the following situations:

  * **Privilege against self-incrimination** : means that you can refuse to answer questions or hand over documents that may implicate you in criminal proceedings. 
  * **Legal professional privilege** : means a legal advisor and their client cannot be forced to disclose communications between them. If any communication is made in contemplation of litigation (for example, with a court case in mind), then that communication is also privileged. 
  * **Sacerdotal privilege** : means that priests can refuse to answer questions about what was said in the confessional. Similarly, communications with a counsellor can also be privileged. 

If you object to answering a question, the judge will decide if you must
answer the question. If the judge decides that you cannot rely on a
"privilege", then you must answer the question. If you fail to do so, you will
be in contempt of court and you can be imprisoned.
