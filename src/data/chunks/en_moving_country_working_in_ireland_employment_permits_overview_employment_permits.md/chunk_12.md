##  Dependant, Partner, Spouse Employment Permit

A Dependant, Partner, Spouse Employment Permit is for the dependants of people
on a Critical Skills Employment Permit or a researcher under a Hosting
Agreement. The spouse or de-facto partner of a person on a Critical Skills
Employment Permit or a Hosting Agreement does not need this permit as they do
not need an employment permit to work in Ireland. However, any other
dependants will need an employment permit and can apply for a Dependant,
Partner, Spouse Employment Permit.
