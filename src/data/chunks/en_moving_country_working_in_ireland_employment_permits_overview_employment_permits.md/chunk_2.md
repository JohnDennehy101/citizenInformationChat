##  Introduction

Most non-EEA nationals must have an employment permit to work in Ireland. If
you have moved to Ireland to join a family member, or you have been granted
residence in Ireland by the Minister for Justice, you may be allowed to [ work
without an employment permit ](/en/moving-country/working-in-ireland/migrant-
workers/coming-to-work-in-ireland/) .

Employment permits are processed by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and
Employment (DETE). Usually, you apply for the employment permit when you have
been offered a job. You must get your employment permit before you come to
Ireland in most cases. You can apply for the employment permit yourself, or
your employer can apply for you.

There are different types of employment permits administered by DETE and a
special [ Hosting Agreement for academic researchers

visa-options/applying-for-a-long-stay-employment-visa/scientific-researcher/)
administered by the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research,
Innovation and Science. The most common employment permits are the [ General
Employment Permit ](/en/moving-country/working-in-ireland/employment-
permits/work-permits/) and the [ Critical Skills Employment Permit
](/en/moving-country/working-in-ireland/employment-permits/green-card-
permits/) .

The employment permits scheme is governed by the [ Employment Permits Acts
](http://www.lawreform.ie/_fileupload/RevisedActs/WithAnnotations/HTML/en_act_2006_0016.htm)
. On 2 September 2024, the Employment Permits Act 2024 comes into effect and
introduces some changes to employment permits law in Ireland.
