####  **Can I change employer?**

From 2 September 2024, a CSEP permit holder can change to another employer
after **9 months** have passed since you started your first employment. You
donâ€™t have to apply for a new permit, but you have to move within the
profession.

You cannot start work with your new employer until the employment permit has
been reissued. You must start work with your new employer within **1 month**
of the new permit being issued.
