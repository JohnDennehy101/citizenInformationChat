####  **Can I change employers?**

From 2 September 2024, GEP permit holders can change to another employer after
**9 months** have passed since you started your first employment. You donâ€™t
have to apply for a new permit, but you have to move within the profession.
For example, a meat processing operative can move to another meat processing
role.
