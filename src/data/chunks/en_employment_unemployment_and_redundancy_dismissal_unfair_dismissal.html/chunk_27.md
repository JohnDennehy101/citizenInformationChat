###  If you had successive fixed-term contracts

Employees cannot be employed on a series of fixed-term contracts indefinitely.

You cannot be kept on successive fixed-term contracts for more than 4 years.
This does not include a single fixed-term contract. For example, you can get a
5-year fixed-term contract, but you cannot get 5 one-year fixed-term
contracts.

If your employer wants you to continue in the job, they must employ you under
an open-ended contract (also called a _contract of indefinite duration_ ).

The only exception is where your employer has objective grounds justifying the
renewal of your fixed-term contract. The employer must prove that a further
renewal is appropriate and necessary to achieve a legitimate objective.

The Unfair Dismissal Acts have a special provision to make sure successive
temporary contracts are not used to avoid the employee having the protection
of the unfair dismissal legislation. Where a fixed-term or specified-purpose
contract ends, and you are re-employed within 3 months, you are deemed to have
continuous service.

So, even if the employer excludes the unfair dismissals legislation in the
manner described above, an adjudicator at the Workplace Relations Commission
(WRC) will consider whether the use of such contracts was wholly or partly to
avoid you having the protection of the unfair dismissals legislation.

If the WRC finds this was the case, and the contracts were not separated by
more than 3 months and the job was similar, then your case can be dealt with
as if you were in continuous employment. The employer must then justify your
dismissal in the normal way.
