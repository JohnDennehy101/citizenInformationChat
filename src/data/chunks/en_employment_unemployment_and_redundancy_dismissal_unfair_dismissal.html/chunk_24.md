####  Any contributory conduct

This calculation takes into account any conduct (behaviour) by you that
contributed to the dismissal, even though it was an unfair dismissal.

The ‘degree of contribution’ (the level at which you contributed to the
dismissal) is stated as a percentage, and your overall compensation is reduced
by the same percentage.
