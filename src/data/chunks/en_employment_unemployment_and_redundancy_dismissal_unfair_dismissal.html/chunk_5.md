###  Time limits

You must complain about an unfair dismissal **within 6 months** of the
dismissal happening. Under the Unfair Dismissals Acts, the ‘date of your
dismissal’ is the date your _notice_ expires.

Read about the [ statutory minimum period of notice ](/en/employment/starting-
work-and-changing-job/changing-job/giving-notice/) , and check if your
contract of employment gives a longer period of notice.

The 6-month time limit may be extended for a further 6 months, but only if you
have a ‘reasonable cause’ for the delay.
