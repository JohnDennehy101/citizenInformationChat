##  Dismissal from fixed-term or specified-purpose contracts

A [ fixed-term contract ](/en/employment/employment-rights-and-
conditions/contracts-of-employment/rights-of-fixed-term-workers/) is a
contract of a specific length, agreed by you and your employer. A _specified-
purpose contract_ is also of a limited duration and ends when the job is
completed (but neither you nor your employer know from the outset how long it
will take).
