####  Exceptions to the ‘length of service’ rule

If you have worked for your employer for less than 12 months, you may still
bring a claim for unfair dismissal if you were dismissed for:

  * Trade union membership or activity 
  * Pregnancy, giving birth, breastfeeding or any matters connected with pregnancy or birth 
  * Availing of rights to maternity leave, adoptive leave, paternity leave, parental leave, carer’s leave, parent's leave, force majeure leave, or the national minimum wage

If you have less than one year’s service and your employer has not followed [
fair procedures ](/en/government-in-ireland/irish-constitution-1/constitution-
fundamental-rights/) when dismissing you, you may be able to make a claim
under Section 20(1) of the Industrial Relations Act 1969. However, any
recommendation from the Court is not legally binding on the employer.
