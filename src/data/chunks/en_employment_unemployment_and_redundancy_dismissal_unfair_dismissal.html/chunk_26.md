###  Dismissal at the end of a contract

Dismissal at the end of a fixed-term or specified-purpose contract may be
considered ‘unfair’ under the Unfair Dismissals Acts. However, the employer
can prevent this by meeting 3 conditions:

  1. The contract must be in writing and set out the specific duration of the fixed-term contract (or, in the case of a specified-purpose contract, the object of the contract) 
  2. The contract must be signed by both the employee and the employer 
  3. The contract must contain a specific clause stating that the expiry of the contract will not make it liable to a claim under the Unfair Dismissals Acts 

If these 3 conditions are not met, then you can claim for unfair dismissal (as
long as you meet the usual eligibility criteria – see ‘Can I bring a claim for
unfair dismissal?’ above).
