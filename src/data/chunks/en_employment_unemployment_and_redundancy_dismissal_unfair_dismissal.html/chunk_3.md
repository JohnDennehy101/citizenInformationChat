###  What does not count as ‘unfair’ dismissal?

Your dismissal from work is not ‘unfair’ if it results from:

  * Your capability, competence or qualifications for the job 
  * Your conduct (behaviour) 
  * You being unable to work (or continue to work) in the position you held without breaking the law (for example, if your job involves driving and you are then legally disqualified from driving) 
  * Your redundancy (read more about redundancy below) 

In general, [ redundancy ](/en/employment/unemployment-and-
redundancy/redundancy/) is a fair reason for dismissal. However, you may have
grounds (reasons) for complaint if you were [ unfairly selected for redundancy
](/en/employment/unemployment-and-redundancy/redundancy/redundancy-
procedures/) , or if you feel there was no genuine need for redundancy.

Unless your employer can prove there was a [ genuine redundancy situation
](/en/employment/unemployment-and-redundancy/redundancy/what-is-redundancy/)
and that they followed [ fair procedures ](/en/employment/unemployment-and-
redundancy/redundancy/redundancy-procedures/) , your dismissal may be
considered ‘unfair’.

If you make a claim for unfair dismissal, you cannot also claim redundancy.
