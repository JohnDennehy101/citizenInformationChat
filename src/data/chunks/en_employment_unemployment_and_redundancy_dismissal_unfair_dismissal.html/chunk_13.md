##  How to bring a claim for unfair dismissal

If you meet certain conditions (see ‘Can I bring a claim for unfair
dismissal?’ above), you can bring a claim for unfair dismissal against your
employer.

If your employer accepts they dismissed you, they must show that there were [
fair grounds for the dismissal ](/en/employment/unemployment-and-
redundancy/dismissal/fair-grounds-for-dismissal/) . A dismissal is
automatically presumed to be unfair unless your employer can show substantial
grounds (reasons) to justify it. This does not apply in cases of [
constructive dismissal ](/en/employment/unemployment-and-
redundancy/dismissal/constructive-dismissal/) .

Ask your employer for a written statement of the reasons for your dismissal.
Your employer should give you the statement **within 14 days** of your
request. Once you get this written statement, you can bring your complaint to
the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC).
