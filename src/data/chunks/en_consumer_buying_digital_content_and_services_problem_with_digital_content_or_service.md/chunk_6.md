###  What you must do to end the contract

You must tell the trader that the contract is being terminated. You can do
this verbally or in writing.

You must not use the content or service you are cancelling and you must make
sure nobody else uses it.

If the content came with any physical device, you must return this to the
seller, if they ask for it. The seller must cover any costs for the return.

Where the content or service contract is terminated, any ancillary contract is
also automatically terminated.
