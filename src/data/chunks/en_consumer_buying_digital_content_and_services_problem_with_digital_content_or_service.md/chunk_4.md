##  If something goes wrong

If things go wrong it is always the seller who should put things right. The
seller must resolve any issue, so the content or service meets what was agreed
in the contract.

The seller must correct the issue for free, within a _reasonable_ time and
without significant inconvenience to you. A reasonable time means the shortest
possible time to fix the issue.

If it is not possible or too expensive for the seller to resolve the issue,
you have the right to either a price reduction or refund. If the issue with
the content or service is minor, you can only ask for a price reduction.
