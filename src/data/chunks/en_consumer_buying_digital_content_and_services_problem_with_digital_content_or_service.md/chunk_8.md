##  Right to a price reduction

If you prefer, you can ask for a proportionate reduction in price instead of a
refund. A proportionate reduction in price must reflect the reduced value of
the content or services to you.

If the issue with the content or service is minor, you can only ask for a
price reduction. If there is a dispute, it is up to the trader to prove that
the issues are minor.
