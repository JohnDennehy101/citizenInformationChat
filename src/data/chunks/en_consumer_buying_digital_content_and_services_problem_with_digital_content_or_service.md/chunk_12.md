###  Take your complaint further

If your complaint is not resolved within a reasonable timeframe or you are not
happy with the response, you can:

  * Use out-of-court procedures such as the [ European Consumer Centres Network ](https://www.eccireland.ie/) (for cross-border disputes only) and [ Online Dispute Resolution ](/en/consumer/how-to-complain/online-dispute-resolution/) (for national and cross-border online disputes) 
  * Take a claim against the seller using the [ Small Claims Procedure ](/en/justice/courts-system/small-claims-court/) . For cross-border disputes within the EU, you can use the [ European Small Claims Procedure. ](/en/justice/courts-system/european-small-claims-procedure/)
  * Contact the card provider and ask them to reverse the transaction, if you paid by credit or debit card. This is known as chargeback. Some other payment methods also provide protection schemes (for example, [ PayPal buyer protection ](https://www.paypal.com/ie/smarthelp/article/what-is-paypal-buyer-protection-faq1269) ). The CCPC has more information on [ chargeback. ](https://www.ccpc.ie/consumers/money/credit-cards/disputed-card-transactions-chargeback/)
