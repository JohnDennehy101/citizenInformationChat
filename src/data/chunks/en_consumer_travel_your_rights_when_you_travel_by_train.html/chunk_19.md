###  Your right to assistance

Assistance means extra help because you have a disability or reduced mobility.
You must tell the train company what help you will need before you travel. The
train company should then give the assistance free of charge.

The following conditions apply:

  * You must give at least 48 hours’ notice before you travel. Irish Rail asks for 24 hours’ notice. 
  * You must arrive at the station at the time stated. The train company cannot tell you to arrive more than 1 hour before the departure time or the check-in time. 
  * If they do not give you a specific arrival time, you should arrive 30 minutes before the departure time. 

You can get a refund or re-routing if you have a ticket or a reservation and:

  * You told the train company about your specific needs 
  * You are not allowed to travel because of your disability or reduced mobility
