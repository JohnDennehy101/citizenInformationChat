###  Care and assistance

If it seems likely that your train will be more than 60 minutes late, the
train company must provide ‘care and assistance’ free of charge. This can
include:

  * Meals and refreshments (for example, teas, coffees and non-alcoholic beverages) that are suitable for the waiting time and if available on the train or in the station 
  * Accommodation, and transport between the station and accommodation, where a stay of more than 1 night is necessary. 
  * Alternative travel arrangements
