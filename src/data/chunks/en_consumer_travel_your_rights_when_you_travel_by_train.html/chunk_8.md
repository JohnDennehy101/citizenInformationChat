###  Non-Mandatory EU rules for rail services

Some other EU rules are not mandatory, which means that EU Member States can
decide to exclude some of their train services from the rules.

This can apply to local, commuter and intercity domestic train services as
well as international trains that start or finish their journeys outside the
EU.

These include rules on:

  * Travel information 
  * Cancellations and delays (see ‘Cancellations and delays’ below).
