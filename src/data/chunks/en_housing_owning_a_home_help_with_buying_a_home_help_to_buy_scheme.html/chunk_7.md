####  Your mortgage and shared equity schemes

If you are getting help to buy your home with a shared equity scheme like the
[ First Home Scheme ](/en/housing/owning-a-home/help-with-buying-a-home/first-
home-scheme/) or the [ Local Authority Affordable Purchase Scheme
](/en/housing/owning-a-home/help-with-buying-a-home/local-authority-
affordable-purchase-scheme/) , this funding is not considered when calculating
the loan to value ratio for the HTB Scheme. Only your mortgage amount is
considered.

For example, if you are buying a home that costs €365,000 and have been
approved for a mortgage of €224,000 and have equity funding of €73,000, you
will not qualify for HTB. The equity funding is not considered when
calculating the LTV, so your LTV is 61% based on your mortgage. This means you
have not reached the 70% minimum LTV requirement and do not qualify for HTB.

With the Local Authority Affordable Purchase Scheme, you must also remember to
use the market value of the property and not the reduced purchase price when
calculating if your mortgage qualifies for HTB.
