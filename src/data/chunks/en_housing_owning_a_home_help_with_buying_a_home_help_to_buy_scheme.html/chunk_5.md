###  About your property ownership

To qualify you must be a first-time buyer who buys or self-builds a new
residential property between **1 January 2017** and **31 December 2025.** (The
scheme was available if you bought or built a home between 19 July 2016 and 31
December 2016, but you had to claim it before 31/12/2019).

If you are buying or building the property with someone else, they must also
be a first-time buyer.

You will not qualify if:

  * You have previously bought or built a house or apartment, either by yourself or with someone else. This applies even if you are now separated or divorced from that person and have given up your interest in the property. 
  * You have owned a home abroad 
  * You don't plan on living in the property as your main home for at least 5 years after buying or building it (HTB is not available for investment properties) 
  * You have not taken out a mortgage for the property 

If you have inherited or been gifted a property and you want to buy or build a
new property, you may still qualify for HTB as long as you meet all the other
conditions of the scheme. Contact [ Revenue

this.
