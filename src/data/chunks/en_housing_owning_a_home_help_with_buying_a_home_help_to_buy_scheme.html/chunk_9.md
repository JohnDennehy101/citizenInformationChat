##  Does my new home qualify for the Help to Buy Scheme?

Your new home must meet certain criteria to qualify for the Help to Buy
scheme.

  * The property you buy or build must be a new residential property. It must never have been used, or have been suitable for use, as a residential property before. If the property was non-residential before, but has been converted for residential use, it may qualify for HTB. 
  * If you are buying a new home, the market value of the property must be €500,000 or less. In most cases the market value is the price you pay for the property. However, if the price has been subsidised, for example, if you are buying a home from your local authority under the Local Authority Affordable Purchase Scheme, you must use the market value. 
  * If you are building your home, the approved valuation of your home must be €500,000 or less. The valuation is approved by your mortgage provider and is valued at the time the mortgage is entered into. It includes the cost of the site. 
  * If you are buying your new home, the contractor or developer you buy it from must be approved by Revenue. Revenue has a [ list of approved developers and contractors ](https://www.revenue.ie/en/property/documents/htb-qualifying-contractors.pdf) , so you can check that they are approved. 
  * If you are building your own home, you will need a solicitor (registered with Revenue as a ‘HTB approver’) to verify your HTB claim 
  * You must live in the property for at least 5 years from the date that it is habitable 

You will have to pay the HTB payment back if you do not live there for 5
years. For more on this, see ‘Can Revenue ask me to repay the Help to Buy
payment?’ below.
