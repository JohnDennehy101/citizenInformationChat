##  Conference meeting

A probation officer must arrange the family conference within 28 days of being
told to do so by the court. The child and the child’s family attend the
meeting. The victim may attend. Other relevant people may also attend, such as
a teacher or social worker.

At the meeting, the group will talk about how the child’s offence affected the
victim, the community and the child’s family. Then the group will think of
ways that the child can take responsibility for their behaviour and make good
the harm done. The process is based on the principles of [ restorative
justice. ](https://restorativejustice.ie/)
