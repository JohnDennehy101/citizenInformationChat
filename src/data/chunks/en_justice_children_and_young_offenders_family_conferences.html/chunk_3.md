##  Ordering the family conference

When the court (usually the [ Children Court ](/en/justice/courts-
system/children-court/) ) orders a family conference to be held the court
proceedings are adjourned until the conference is completed.

The Court orders a family conference when:

  * The child accepts responsibility for their criminal behaviour 
  * The court believes that an action plan should be devised 
  * The child and the childâ€™s parents or guardians agree to participate in the conference
