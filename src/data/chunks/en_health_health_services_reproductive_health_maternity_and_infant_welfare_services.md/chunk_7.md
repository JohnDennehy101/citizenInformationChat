##  The public health nurse

Public health nurses are registered nurses that provide nursing and midwifery
care in the community.

If you have had your baby in hospital, the public health nurse will visit you
and your baby at home, free of charge. This visit usually happens within 72
hours of returning home from hospital.

If you have had a [ home birth ](/en/birth-family-relationships/before-your-
baby-is-born/home-birth/) or used the [ Domino Scheme ](/en/birth-family-
relationships/before-your-baby-is-born/flexible-maternity-services#lc93a6) ,
your midwife will have already visited you. They will then hand over your care
to your public health nurse.
