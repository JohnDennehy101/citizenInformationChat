###  What is included in the scheme?

On the Maternity and Infant Care Scheme, your maternity care is provided by
your family doctor (GP) and a hospital _obstetrician_ (a doctor who
specialises in pregnancy and labour).

If this is your first pregnancy, the GP will carry out your first examination
(ideally before 12 weeks). You will have a further 5 examinations during the
pregnancy, which alternate between GP visits and maternity unit/hospital
visits. Your schedule of visits may be changed by your GP or hospital
obstetrician, depending on your situation.

If this is not your first pregnancy, you will have an initial examination and
a further 6 examinations.

If you have a significant illness, for example, diabetes or hypertension, you
may have up to 5 additional visits with your GP.

The Maternity and Infant Care Scheme also provides for 2 postnatal visits to
the GP. This includes:

  * An examination of the baby at 2 weeks old 
  * An examination of you and the baby at 6 weeks old
