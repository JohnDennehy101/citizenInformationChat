##  Maternity and Infant Care Scheme

The Maternity and Infant Care Scheme provides a programme of care to all
expectant mothers who are [ ordinarily resident ](/en/health/health-
system/entitlement-to-public-health-services#l2b820) in Ireland.

This care is provided by your GP and a maternity unit/hospital. This is called
_combined care_ or _shared care_ .

You are entitled to this service even if you do not have a medical card or GP
visit card. Almost all GPs have agreements with the [ Health Service Executive
(HSE) ](http://hse.ie/) to provide these services; they do not have to be part
of the [ medical card ](/en/health/medical-cards-and-gp-visit-cards/medical-
card/) scheme.

Applications for services under the Scheme are made though your GP when your
pregnancy is confirmed. The diagnosis of pregnancy forms part of the Scheme.
The application form should be completed by both you and your GP and your GP
will submit it to the HSE where it will be processed.
