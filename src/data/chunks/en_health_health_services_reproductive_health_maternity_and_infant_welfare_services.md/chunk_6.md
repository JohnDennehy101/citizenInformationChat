##  Medical card or GP visit card for your baby

After your baby is born, their entitlement to other free GP services depends
on whether or not they have a [ medical card ](/en/health/medical-cards-and-
gp-visit-cards/medical-card/) or [ GP visit card ](/en/health/medical-cards-
and-gp-visit-cards/gp-visit-cards/) . Children under the age of 6 are
automatically entitled to a GP visit card – read about [ registering for your
child’s GP visit card ](/en/health/medical-cards-and-gp-visit-cards/gp-visit-
cards-for-under-8s/) .

If you have a medical card, you can apply for one for your baby if you are
getting [ Child Benefit ](/en/social-welfare/families-and-children/child-
benefit/) for them. Send a covering note along with a photocopy of the child's
birth certificate, their PPS Number and your medical card details to the
medical card [ Client Registration Unit ](/en/health/medical-cards-and-gp-
visit-cards/medical-card#lef21f) .
