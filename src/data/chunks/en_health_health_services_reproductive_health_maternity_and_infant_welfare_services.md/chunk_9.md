###  The ‘heel prick’ test

Your midwife or public health nurse will offer to do a ‘newborn bloodspot
screening’ for your baby. This is also known as the _heel prick test_ . It
checks if your baby is at risk of a number of rare conditions, including
cystic fibrosis. You will be asked for your consent.

The heel prick test usually takes place in your home. However, if you stay in
hospital longer than 72 hours after the birth of your baby, it may take place
in the hospital.
