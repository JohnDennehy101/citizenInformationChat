###  Developmental checks

The public health nurse will check your baby's development at different
stages. For example, at 9 months, they will check your baby's eyesight and
hearing, motor development, vocalisation and general growth.

Developmental checks are generally carried out at:

  * 3 months 
  * 9-11 months 
  * 18-24 months 
  * 3-and-a-quarter years to 3-and-a-half years 

You will be contacted by your public health nurse before each check to arrange
a date and time. If you have not heard from the public health nurse, [ call
your local health centre
](https://www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/2/healthcentres/) to make an
appointment. If you are concerned about your baby's development between
checks, contact your public health nurse for advice.

Examinations of your baby's development by your public health nurse are
provided free of charge.
