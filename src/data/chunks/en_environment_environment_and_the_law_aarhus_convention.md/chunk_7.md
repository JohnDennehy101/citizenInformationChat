##  How is the Aarhus Convention implemented?

There are 2 EU directives that implement the Convention:

  1. [ Directive 2003/4/EC on Public Access to Environmental Information (pdf) ](http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2003:041:0026:0032:EN:PDF)
  2. [ Directive 2003/35/EC on Public Participation ](http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32003L0035)

Both directives have been fully implemented in Ireland which means they fully
apply.

Additional measures were included in the [ Environment (Miscellaneous
Provisions) Act 2011
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2011/act/20/enacted/en/html) to implement
parts of the Convention. This Act introduced new rules about the costs that
apply in certain cases where environmental information has been requested. The
Act also states that a judge must take notice of the Convention in relevant
cases.
