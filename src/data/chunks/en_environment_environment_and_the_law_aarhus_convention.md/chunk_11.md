###  Genetically Modified Organisms (GMO) Amendment to the Convention

The [ GMO Amendment to the Convention
](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/b3b1a-aarhus-convention/#convention-
protocols) means that there must be public participation in decisions about
the deliberate release of [ genetically modified organisms (GMOs)
](https://www.gov.ie/en/policy-information/26f183-environmental-
policy/#genetically-modified-organisms-gmos) . These requirements are more
specific than the general requirements relating to public participation which
apply to other issues covered by the Aarhus Convention.

‘Deliberate release’ means placing genetically modified (GM) products on the
market, or the cultivation of GM crops. It does not include the use of GMOs in
controlled settings, such as laboratories.

The GMO Amendment was implemented in the EU by [ Directive 2001/18/EC on the
Deliberate Release of GMOs ](https://www.epa.ie/our-
services/licensing/gmo/deliberate-release/) . This directive became law in
Ireland through the [ Genetically Modified Organisms (Deliberate Release)
Regulations 2003 (SI 500 of 2003)
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2003/si/500/made/en/print) .
