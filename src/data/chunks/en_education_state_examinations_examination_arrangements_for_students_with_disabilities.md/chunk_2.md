##  Exam arrangements for students with special needs

If you are a secondary school student with special needs, you can get special
arrangements for sitting State examinations such as the Leaving Certificate
and Junior Certificate.

Students with disabilities (for example, visual impairments, learning
difficulties, motor and mobility impairments and so on) can apply through
their school for Reasonable Accommodations at Certificate Examinations (RACE).

Reasonable accommodations are designed to remove, as far as possible, the
impact of a disability on a student's performance and enable the student to
access the state examinations on an equal basis with other students. It does
not give the student an unfair advantage over other students in the same
examination.

The [ State Examinations Commission
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/education/state-examinations/the-
state-examinations-commission/) oversees the RACE scheme.
