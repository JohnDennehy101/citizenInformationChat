####  Community and Rural Development

â‚¬48 million will be invested in a revised Local and Community Development
Programme in 2014 to increase access to formal and informal educational
activities and resources, and to increase people's work readiness and
employment prospects. Some 14,000 people who are distanced from the labour
market will receive direct one-to one labour market training and supports
through the Programme.
