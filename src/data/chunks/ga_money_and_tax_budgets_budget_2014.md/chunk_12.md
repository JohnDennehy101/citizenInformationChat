###  Maternity Benefit and Adoptive Benefit

From 6 January 2014 the minimum and maximum rates of Maternity Benefit and
Adoptive Benefit will be standardised at €230 per week for new applicants.
This will result in an increase of up to €12.20 for those receiving less than
€230 per week and a reduction of up to €32 per week for all other claimants.
The change will apply to new claimants. Existing claimants will not be
affected.
