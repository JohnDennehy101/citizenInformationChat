###  Income tax

From 1 January 2014, the **One-Parent Family Tax Credit** is to be replaced
with a new Single Person Child Carer Tax Credit. The new credit will be to the
same value but will be available only to the principal carer of the child.

Tax relief on private **health insurance premiums** will be limited to €1,000
for each adult insured and €500 for each child. This change applies to
policies which are renewed or entered into on or after 16 October 2013. A
child for the purposes of this provision includes a student over 18 years and
under 23 years who is in full-time education. Relief will continue to be
granted at 20%.

A **new Home Renovation Incentive scheme** of tax relief will be introduced
for a period of two years. The scheme provides tax relief for home renovation
work.

To encourage **those who wish to start their own business** , an exemption
from income tax up to a maximum of €40,000 per annum will be provided for a
period of two years, to individuals who set up a qualifying, un-incorporated
business, having been unemployed for a period of at least 15 months prior to
establishing the business.

**Top Slicing Relief** , which is a reduction of tax due on lump sum payments
when leaving employment, will no longer be available from 1 January 2014 in
respect of all ex-gratia lump sum payments.

Lump sum payments to claimants under the **Magdalene Laundry Fund** will be
tax exempt.
