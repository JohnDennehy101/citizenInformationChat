###  VAT

The **9% reduced VAT rate** , which was introduced in 2011 as part of the
Government Jobs Initiative for tourism-related services, was due to revert to
13.5% on 31 December 2013. The 9% VAT rate is being retained.

The **annual VAT cash receipts basis threshold** for small to medium
businesses is being increased from €1.25 million to €2 million with effect
from 1 May 2014. This change will assist such businesses in the critical area
of cash-flow and reduce administration.

The **farmer’s flat-rate addition** will be increased from 4.8% to 5% with
effect from 1 January 2014. The flat-rate scheme compensates unregistered
farmers for VAT incurred on their farming inputs.
