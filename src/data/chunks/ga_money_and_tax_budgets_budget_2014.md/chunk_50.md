####  Medical cards and GP Visit Cards

The income limits for medical cards for people aged over 70 will reduce from
€600/€1,200 per week (single person/couple) to €500/ €900 per week. The GP
Visit Card will still be available to people aged over 70 with income up to
€700/€1,400 per week. It is planned to have the necessary legislation in place
by the end of 2013 or early 2014.

Unemployed people who return to work will be entitled to retain a GP Visit
Card for 3 years without a means test. Currently they can retain their medical
card for 3 years. This measure requires legislation and it is to be phased in
during 2014.

A planned review of all medical cards to remove ineligible and redundant cards
is expected to save €113 million.
