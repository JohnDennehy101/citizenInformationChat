####  Assistance towards paying for housing

The **minimum contribution towards Rent Supplement** for all couples will
increase by €5 per week from €35 to €40 to align Rent Supplement contributions
with the local authority rents structure. The minimum contribution towards
Mortgage Interest Supplement for all couples will increase by €5 per week from
€35 to €40. The minimum contribution for single people, including single
people with children, will not change.

The **Mortgage Interest Supplement scheme will be discontinued for new
entrants** . For existing recipients, the scheme will be wound down over a
4-year period from January 2014.

The legislative basis for the new **Housing Assistance Payment (HAP)** , which
is to replace Rent Supplement, will be introduced in 2014\. A test phase will
begin in seven local authorities.
