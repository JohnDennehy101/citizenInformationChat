##  Introduction

Budget 2014 was announced on 15 October 2013.

The main Budget changes that may affect people living in Ireland are set out
below.

This document sets out changes in the areas of taxation, social welfare,
health, housing, education, employment and other areas. It is an overview and
not a complete statement of the measures announced in Budget 2014.

**This document will be updated throughout the week as more details become

Some of the changes announced in the Budget come into effect immediately.
Others take effect from the beginning of January 2014 or in mid-2014. Many
others have to be finalised before coming into effect.

Some elements of these measures may change when the legislation required to
bring them into effect is enacted.
