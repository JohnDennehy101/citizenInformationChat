###  People with mental disabilities

People with mental disabilities are dealt with in the same way as children
under 14 years of age. If a court is satisfied that a person with a mental
disability can give an intelligible account of events, then the court can take
evidence from the person without the oath. This provision is set out under the
[ Criminal Evidence Act 1992
](https://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1992/act/12/enacted/en/html) and the [
Children Act 1997
](https://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1997/act/40/enacted/en/print.html) .
