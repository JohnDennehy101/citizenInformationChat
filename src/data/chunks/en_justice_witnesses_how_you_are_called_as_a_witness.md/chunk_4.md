###  Children

The court must be satisfied that the child is capable of giving an
intelligible account of what they witnessed. Children under 14 do not have to
make an oath or affirmation, but the child is guilty of an offence if they
knowingly give evidence which is false or untrue.

If a witness is under 14 years of age the judge may ask to talk to them in
private before they give evidence. This is in order to assess the child's
ability to give an intelligible account of events. Read more about [ witnesses
under the age of 18 ](/en/justice/witnesses/witnesses-under-18-years-old/) .
