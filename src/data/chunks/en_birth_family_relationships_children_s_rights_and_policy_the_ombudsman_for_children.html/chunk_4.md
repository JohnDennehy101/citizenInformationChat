###  How does the OCO promote the rights and welfare of children?

The OCO highlights issues that concern children, and monitors and reviews
legislation, Government policies, and how they affect children. The OCO
advises Government, and other organisations delivering services on behalf of
the Government, to help make sure laws and policies respect childrenâ€™s rights.

The OCO also supports and encourages [ children and young people to find out
about their rights ](/en/birth-family-relationships/children-s-rights-and-
policy/children-and-rights-in-ireland/) and how they can be protected and
realised.
