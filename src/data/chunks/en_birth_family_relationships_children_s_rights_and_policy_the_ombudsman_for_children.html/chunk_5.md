##  Making a complaint

The OCO complaints service is free and independent.

Before making a complaint, you must contact the organisation directly and go
through their complaints procedure. It is important that you wait for a final
decision or reply to your complaint.

If you are not happy with the response from the organisation, you can make a
complaint to the OCO. You can also make a complaint to the OCO if the service
has not responded to your complaint when the service said it would.

In most cases, the complaint must be received by the OCO within 2 years of the
action or event in order to investigate.
