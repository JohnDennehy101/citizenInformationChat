##  What is an ombudsman?

An ombudsman is a person who has been appointed to investigate complaints
about services and organisations to make sure your rights are upheld and
respected. Ombudsmen are independent, free and impartial.

There are different ombudsmen with responsibility for investigating complaints
about different services and organisations. For example, the [ Garda Síochána
Ombudsman Commission (GSOC) ](/en/justice/law-enforcement/garda-siochana-
ombudsman-commission/) deals with complaints from the public about members of
the Garda Síochána (the Irish police force). The [ Financial Services and
Pensions Ombudsman ](https://www.fspo.ie/) investigates complaints about
financial service providers and pension providers.
