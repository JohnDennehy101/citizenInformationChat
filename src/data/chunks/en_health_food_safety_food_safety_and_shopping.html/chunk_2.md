##  Introduction

As a consumer, you have a right to buy properly stored food from the shop and
supermarket. You should check that food is properly packaged before you buy it
and check that it has a clear use-by or best before date.

When grocery shopping, avoid:

  * Chilled food that is left out of the fridge or frozen food left out of the freezer 
  * Cracked eggs 
  * Leaking cartons or containers 
  * Swollen food packages (especially dairy, meat and poultry products) 
  * Broken or imperfect safety seals 
  * Raw foods and cooked foods that are not kept separated 
  * Servers handling raw meat and cooked food without washing their hands, or using the same utensil 
  * Products with mould, discolouration or infestation
