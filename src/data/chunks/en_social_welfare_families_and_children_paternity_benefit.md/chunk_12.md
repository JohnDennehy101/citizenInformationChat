###  How the payment is made

Paternity Benefit is paid directly into your bank or building society account
(a current or deposit account, not a mortgage account) or you can choose to
have it paid directly into your employer's bank account.

**Note:** Some employers will continue to pay an employee, in full, while the
employee is on paternity leave. In such cases the employer will generally
require the employee to have any Paternity Benefit paid to them. You should
check your contract of employment to see what applies to you.
