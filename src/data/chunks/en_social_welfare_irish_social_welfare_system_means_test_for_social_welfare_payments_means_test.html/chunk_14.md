###  **How income from maintenance is assessed**

For most social welfare payments, the DSP assesses income from maintenance as
means. However, since 4 June 2024, child maintenance payments are not included
in the means test for any social welfare payment.

The DSP also assesses any maintenance paid to your spouse, civil partner, or
cohabitant. See ‘Assessing the means of a couple’ below.

However, rent or mortgage payments of up to €95.23 per week can be offset
against maintenance payments. You can read more about [ Maintenance and social
welfare payments ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/irish-
