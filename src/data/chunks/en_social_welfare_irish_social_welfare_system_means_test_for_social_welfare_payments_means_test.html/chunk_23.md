##  How capital and property not personally used is assessed

Capital includes:

  * Property (except for your own home) 
  * Savings 
  * Investments. 

If you (or your spouse, civil partner, or cohabitant) own property that you
are not personally using, or if you have investments or any other form of
capital, the DSP assessed the value using a standard formula.

In general, it doesnâ€™t matter whether you get an income from the property or
investment. The only exception to this is where an [ Increase for a Qualified
Adult ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/irish-social-
welfare-system/claiming-a-social-welfare-payment/claiming-an-increase-in-your-
social-welfare-payment-for-an-adult-dependant/) is being assessed for a social
insurance payment. In this case, if you let the property, the DSP assesses the
rental income rather than the capital value.

The property and investments that may be assessed as capital include:

  * Savings in a bank account (or anywhere else) 
  * A house that you have let (rented out) 
  * Stocks and shares. 

If you or your spouse, civil partner, or [ cohabitant
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/birth-family-relationships/cohabiting-
couples/rights-of-cohabiting-couples/#e6e823) saves a portion of your social
welfare payment each week, these savings, as well as savings from most other
sources, will be taken into account as part of your means.
