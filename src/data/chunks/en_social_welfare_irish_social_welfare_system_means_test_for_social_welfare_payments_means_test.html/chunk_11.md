###  **How income from employment is assessed**

How your income from employment or self-employment is assessed depends on the
payment you are applying for. When the DSP assesses your income from
employment, it does not include:

  * PRSI 
  * Union dues 
  * Superannuation or pension contributions 

If you are self-employed, the DSP disregards:

  * PRSI (Class S) 
  * All expenses directly related to your self-employment. However, drawings (money taken from the business for personal use), is assessed as means.
