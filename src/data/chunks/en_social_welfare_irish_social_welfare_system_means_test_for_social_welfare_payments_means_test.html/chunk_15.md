###  **How income from farming is assessed**

If you or your spouse, civil partner, or cohabitant are getting income from
working a farm, the DSP assesses the yearly value to you (this is gross income
minus expenses). If the land is worked but is not being worked to its
potential, then they will make an estimate of the potential net yearly value.

If you are leasing a farm you own, your rental income is assessed.

If you are not working or leasing a farm, the capital value of your land is
assessed.
