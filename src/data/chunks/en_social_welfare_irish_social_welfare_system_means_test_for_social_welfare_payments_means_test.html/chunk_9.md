###  **Social insurance payments and increases for dependants**

If you apply for a [ social insurance payment
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-
system/social-insurance-prsi/) (based on your PRSI contributions), you do not
have to pass a means test.

However, if you apply for an increase in your payment for [ an adult dependant
(also called a qualified adult ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-
welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/claiming-a-social-welfare-
payment/claiming-an-increase-in-your-social-welfare-payment-for-an-adult-
dependant/) ) or [ child dependants (qualified children)
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-
system/claiming-a-social-welfare-payment/claiming-and-increase-in-your-
payment-for-a-child-dependant/) , then your spouse’s, civil partner’s, or
cohabitant’s means will be assessed.

While your means are not taken into account, the DSP will assess any means you
hold jointly.
