##  Introduction

If you have debts over â‚¬20,000 and you are not able to repay them, bankruptcy
may provide a way to settle your debts if the [ other personal insolvency
options ](/en/money-and-tax/personal-finance/debt/personal-
insolvency/personal-insolvency-options/) are not appropriate for your
circumstances.

Bankruptcy distributes your assets among the creditors you owe money to and
protects you from these creditors. The distribution is done through a court
official, the Official Assignee in Bankruptcy, who is based in the [
Insolvency Service of Ireland (ISI) ](http://www.isi.gov.ie/en/isi/pages/home)
and manages its Bankruptcy Division.

Usually, after one year, you will be discharged from bankruptcy and all of
your debts will be written off.

Bankruptcy deals with both secured and unsecured debt.

A secured debt is a loan on which property or goods are available as security
against non-payment. Mortgages and car loans are the most common secured
loans.

Other debts are called unsecured debts, for example, utility bill arrears,
credit card debt and bank overdrafts. However, if they are rolled up into your
mortgage, they become secured loans.
