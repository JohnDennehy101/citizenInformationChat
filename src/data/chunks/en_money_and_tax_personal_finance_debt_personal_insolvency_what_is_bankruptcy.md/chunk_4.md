##  Bankruptcy process

There are several steps you must take when you have decided to make yourself
bankrupt. You are not required to have a solicitor to apply for bankruptcy but
the ISI recommends that you do get legal advice before you declare bankruptcy
or defend a legal action to make you bankrupt.

The [ Debtor’s Guide to Bankruptcy (pdf)
](https://assets.gov.ie/239402/73513a11-c89b-4318-a8b2-23e19caf4b53.pdf)
explains the main steps. The ISI’s website has information on the [ forms that
you need to apply for bankruptcy ](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/6c6cb-

notes on the application process (pdf)

The process is summarised below:

  * Pay a fee of €200 to the Official Assignee and email proof of the lodgement to the ISI Bankruptcy Division 
  * Complete your petition, which must be verified by a sworn [ affidavit ](/en/justice/witnesses/affidavit/) and a sworn statement of affairs 
  * File the relevant bankruptcy application documents in the [ Examiner’s Office ](https://www.courts.ie/office-examiner-high-court)
  * Attend the court hearing on the date given, where the judge will adjudicate you bankrupt if you meet the requirements
