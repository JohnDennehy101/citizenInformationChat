###  **How does the Labour Market Needs Test work?**

From 2 September 2024, the requirement for employers to place adverts for
vacancies in print media no longer applies.

Employers must advertise the vacancy for at least 28 days on online platforms
that are easily accessible by Irish/EEA citizens. The notice must include the
employer’s name, a description of the job, the yearly salary, where the job
will be located and the number of hours per week.

Employers must:

  1. Place the notice of the vacancy on the [ Jobs Ireland website ](https://jobsireland.ie/) and [ European Employment Services (EURES) ](https://eures.europa.eu/index_en) online networks, and 
  2. Place the notice on an additional online platform. The online platform can be: 
     * Any website, software, or electronic technology that provides online publication of information including newspapers’ websites, with the principal purpose being to publish offers of employment. 

You must wait until the Labour Market Needs Test is finished before applying
for your employment permit. The application must be made within 90 days of the
job being advertised with the DSP and EURES.
