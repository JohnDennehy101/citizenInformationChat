###  Changing your job

From 2 September 2024, [ GEP permit holders can change to another employer
](https://enterprise.gov.ie/en/publications/application-to-change-employer-on-
existing-employment-permit.html) after **9 months** have passed (previously 12
months) since you started your first employment. You donâ€™t have to apply for a
new permit, but you have to move within the profession. For example, a meat
processing operative can move to another meat processing role. There is no
requirement to carry out a Labour Market Needs Test (see below) before a
General Employment Permit holder applies to change employer.

The following conditions apply:

  * As the permit holder, you can make a maximum of 3 applications for a change of employer. 
  * A new contract of employment signed by both you and your new employer must be submitted. 
  * You must start employment with your new employer within 1 month of the new permit being issued. 

You cannot start your new employment until the employment permit has been
reissued.

From 2 September 2024, you can also be promoted or move internally within the
same company if you will be using the same skills, and the job is still
eligible.
