##  Labour Market Needs Test (LMNT)

Employers must show that they have tried to fill the vacancy with an Irish or
EEA citizen. They do this by advertising the job in Ireland and within the EU
for a reasonable period. If they cannot find a suitable candidate for the job,
then the employer can recruit a worker that needs an employment permit. This
is called a Labour Market Needs Test (LMNT).

The employment permit applicant must prove that a Labour Market Needs Test has
been carried out.
