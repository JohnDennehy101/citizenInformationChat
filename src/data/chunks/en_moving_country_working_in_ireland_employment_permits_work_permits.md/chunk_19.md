###  Losing your job

If you are made redundant you must notify the Department of Enterprise, Trade
and Employment using the [ redundancy notification form
](https://enterprise.gov.ie/en/publications/notification-of-dismissal-by-
reason-of-redundancy-under-sections-20a-20b-of-the-employment-permits-
act-2006-as-amended-.html) within 28 days of dismissal. The Department will
allow you 6 months to find another job. When you find another job, you can
apply for a new General Employment Permit even if the job is now in one of the
ineligible categories.

You must contact your local immigration registration office to confirm your
immigration status. If you have more than 6 months before your immigration
permission expires, you can reside in Ireland for 6 months. If you have less
than 6 months' immigration permission, you can have your immigration
permission extended to 6 months which means you will have to pay for a new
IRP. If you have not found a new job after 6 months you may have to leave
Ireland.

If you then get an offer of employment in Ireland, you can [ apply for a new
employment permit ](https://www.irishimmigration.ie/my-situation-has-changed-
