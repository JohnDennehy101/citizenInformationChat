##  What is the Fair Deal scheme?

You can apply for financial support to help pay for the cost of care in a
nursing home through the Nursing Homes Support Scheme, also known as the Fair
Deal scheme. The Fair Deal scheme is managed by the [ Health Service Executive
(HSE) ](http://www.hse.ie/eng/) .

Under Fair Deal, you pay a certain amount towards the cost of your care and
the HSE pays the rest. Fair Deal covers approved private nursing homes,
voluntary nursing homes and public nursing homes.

This page explains what Fair Deal covers, how to apply, how much you pay and
how to appeal a decision.
