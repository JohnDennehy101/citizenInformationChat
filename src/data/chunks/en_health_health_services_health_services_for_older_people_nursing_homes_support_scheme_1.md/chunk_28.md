####  **Payments after you die**

When a person dies who used the Fair Deal Scheme, the following information
must be sent to the HSE at least 3 months before distributing the assets of
their estate:

  * A Schedule of Assets - this is a list of all real and personal property and assets owned by the person at the time of their death 
  * Notice in writing of the intention to distribute the assets 

If you fail to do this, you may be personally responsible for the repayment of
any potential overpayment of the Fair Deal Scheme.
