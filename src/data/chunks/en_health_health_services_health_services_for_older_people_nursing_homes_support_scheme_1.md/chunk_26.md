####  Waiting list

There is a set level of funding for the scheme each year, so your name may go
onto a waiting list until funding becomes available. If this is the case, the
HSE will let you know when it writes to tell you if you are eligible for State
support. While you may be on a waiting list, the HSE will confirm you have
been approved for financial support under the scheme.
