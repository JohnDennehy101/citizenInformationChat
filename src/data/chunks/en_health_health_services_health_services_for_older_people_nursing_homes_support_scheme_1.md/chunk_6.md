###  Choosing a nursing home

Contact your preferred nursing home as soon as possible. You will need to see
if they have a place available and if they can meet your care needs. They may
have a waiting list.

If the nursing home you want does not have space, you can go to a different
one temporarily. You can then apply for a transfer to your preferred nursing
home when the space becomes available.
