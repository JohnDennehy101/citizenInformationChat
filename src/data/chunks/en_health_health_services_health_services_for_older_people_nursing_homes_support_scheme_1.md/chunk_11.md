####  When the Care Needs Assessment is complete

After the Care Needs Assessment, the healthcare professional writes a report.
Based on the report, the HSE decides if long-term nursing home care is the
best option for you. After they make a decision, the HSE will write to you
within 10 working days. You get a copy of the report and the reasons for the
decision.

The HSE may use the Care Needs Assessment to identify other health or personal
social service needs. However, there is no legal requirement for them to
provide the services they identify.

You must be assessed as needing nursing home care to be eligible for either
State support or the Nursing Home Loan.
