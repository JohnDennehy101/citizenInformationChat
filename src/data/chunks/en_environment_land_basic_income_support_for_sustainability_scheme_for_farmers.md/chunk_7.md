###  **What areas of land do not qualify for BISS?**

Non-agricultural areas do not qualify for BISS entitlement payments.

Non-agricultural areas include:

  * Artificial areas such as roads, paths, buildings, farmyards, quarries 
  * Waterways such as streams, lakes, and ponds greater than 0.2 hectares 
  * Sand either from a beach or foreshore 
  * Areas used mainly as sports fields, golf courses or pitch and putt courses 
  * Solar panels and wind turbines 
  * Bog parcels 
  * Horse lunging or jumping areas, horse gallops based on sand 
  * Glasshouses or polytunnels with non-earthen solid floors 
  * Abandoned land, for example, land that has no agricultural activity or is not maintained 

If you have non-agricultural areas in land which is otherwise suitable for
BISS, they will be deducted from the eligible land.
