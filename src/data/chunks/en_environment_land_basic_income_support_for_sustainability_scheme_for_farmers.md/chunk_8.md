##  What are payment entitlements?

The amount of financial support you get is based on your payment entitlements.

You get 1 payment entitlement for 1 eligible hectare of land. But, the value
of each payment entitlement can vary depending on:

  * The payment rates you got on previous direct payment schemes 
  * Any allocations you received from the [ National Reserve ](https://www.gov.ie/en/service/5b7788-national-reserve-new-entrant-category/) as a young or new farmer 
  * Adjustments made each year to move the value of entitlements towards a national average (convergence). See [ BISS 2024 Terms and Conditions (pdf) ](https://www.gov.ie/pdf/?file=https://assets.gov.ie/266405/318c630d-b5f7-48a6-bcf9-4f5332d6863a.pdf%22%20\\l%20%22page=null) for more information. 

The average value of a BISS payment entitlement in 2024 is â‚¬154.64.

You can check the value of your entitlements on your agfood.ie account.

These entitlements must be used in 2 years. If you do not use your
entitlements within this period, you will lose them to the [ National Reserve
](https://www.gov.ie/en/service/5b7788-national-reserve-new-entrant-category/)
.

Gov.ie has [ more information on BISS entitlements
](https://www.gov.ie/en/service/3f1f2-transferring-farm-entitlements/) ,
including how to transfer your payment entitlements to another farmer.

**What is convergence?**

The BISS scheme is moving to a national average for the value of payment
entitlements. This means gradually increasing lower payment entitlements and
decreasing higher payment entitlements.
