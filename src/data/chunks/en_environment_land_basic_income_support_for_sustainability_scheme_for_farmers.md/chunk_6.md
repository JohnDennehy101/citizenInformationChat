###  **What are beneficial features?**

A beneficial feature is a feature which has environmental benefit to the land.

Beneficial features can make up to 50% of a land parcel without affecting the
eligibility of the land for BISS. If they take up more than 50% of the land
parcel, the amount of support you get will be reduced.

This can include features which encourage and support:

  * Biodiversity 
  * Habitat retention 
  * Space for nature 
  * Carbon sequestration (removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere) 

Beneficial features include:

  * Scrub 
  * Trees 
  * Woodland 
  * Rock 
  * Habitat 

**Note** : Different rules apply to areas in the Burren and the Aran Islands,
which are unique karst limestone regions.
