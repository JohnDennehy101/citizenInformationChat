###  **What is an eligible hectare?**

An eligible hectare is an **agricultural area** of land, one hectare in size
that is used for **agricultural activity** .

Agricultural areas that qualify as eligible hectares are:

  * Arable land, which is land used for crop production 
  * Permanent crops, which is land that is repeatedly harvested 
  * Permanent grassland, which is land used to grow grasses, heather or rushes 
  * Agroforestry, which is land used for agriculture and growing trees 
  * Paludiculture, which is the use of wet and rewetted peatlands that are close to their natural permanently wet state for different types of wetland agriculture and forestry 

These areas must be used for agricultural activity to qualify as eligible
hectares. Agricultural activity includes producing agricultural products, such
as livestock or growing crops. It can also include maintaining agricultural
areas, for example, by cutting hedges or mulching.

**What if there are other features on my land?**

An eligible hectare should be primarily used for agricultural activity, but it
can also include other features and still qualify.

For example, an eligible hectare may also have:

  * Hedgerows, hedgerow encroachment or scrub (the average width of the hedge must be less than 7 metres and no individual bulges can be more than 12 metres) 
  * Trees in a line which must be mainly deciduous 
  * Drains 
  * Ponds (less than 0.2 hectares) 
  * Archaeological sites and monuments 
  * Designated habitats 
  * Other landscape features, such as stone walls 

Your land also qualifies for BISS even if half of it is not used for
agricultural activity, but instead is covered with ‘beneficial features’.
