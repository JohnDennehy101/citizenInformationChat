###  **Changes to your application after the deadline**

You can make certain changes to your application after the deadlines without
having to pay a late fee. These changes include:

  * Withdrawing land 
  * Reducing the claimed area of a parcel 
  * Changing the use of a parcel from eligible to ineligible (for example, transferring a house site) 

You will have to pay a late fee for these changes if:

  * The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine informs you of issues with your 2024 BISS application 
  * You are notified about an on-the-spot inspection and it shows non-compliance with the parcels you are changing 
  * You have received payments under the BISS scheme for 2024
