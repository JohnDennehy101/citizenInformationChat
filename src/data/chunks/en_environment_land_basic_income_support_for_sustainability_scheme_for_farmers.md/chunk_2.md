##  What is the Basic Income Support for Sustainability Scheme?

The Basic Income Support for Sustainability Scheme (BISS) is the main EU
support for farmers. It provides income support for farming sustainably and
aims to ensure farmers can make a living from farming.

The amount you get is based on the number of hectares you farm that qualify
for the scheme.

The Basic Income Support for Sustainability Scheme replaced the Basic Payment
Scheme (BPS).

**The Basic Income Support for Sustainability Scheme is currently closed to
new applicants. It will open again in 2025.**
