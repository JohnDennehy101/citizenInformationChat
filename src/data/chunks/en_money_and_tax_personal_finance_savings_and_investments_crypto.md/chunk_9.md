##  Taxation of crypto

There are no specific tax rules for crypto.

If you earn crypto, you have to pay income tax on it in the same way as other
income. If your only other income is PAYE income, read about [ tax on income
that is not from your employer ](/en/money-and-tax/tax/income-tax/tax-return-
non-paye-income/) .

If you make a profit from selling a crypto-asset, you have to pay [ Capital
Gains Tax ](/en/money-and-tax/tax/capital-taxes/capital-gains-tax/) in the
same way as for gains from any other asset such as property.

If you get a gift or inheritance of crypto, you have to pay [ Capital
Acquisitions Tax ](/en/money-and-tax/tax/capital-taxes/capital-acquisitions-
tax/) in the same way as for other gifts or inheritances.
