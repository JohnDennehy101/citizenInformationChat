###  Issuers of stablecoins

Stablecoins are a type of crypto with a value that is linked to a more stable
asset such as gold or a standard currency like the euro.

MiCAR introduces new rules for the issuers of 2 types of stablecoin:

  * E-Money Tokens (EMTs), which are linked to a single official currency 
  * Asset-Referenced Tokens (ARTs), which are linked to several currencies, commodities or other types of crypto 

The rules set out new requirements for information, marketing and funding.
They apply to new issuers from 30 June 2024 and will apply to existing issuers
when they are authorised.
