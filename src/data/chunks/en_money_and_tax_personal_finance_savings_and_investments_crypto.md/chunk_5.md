##  European Union law on crypto

The European Union (EU) is introducing a new law called the [ Markets in
Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCAR) ](https://eur-
lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2023/1114/oj) .

It will regulate service providers for crypto. For example, providers of
services to store, trade or advise on crypto.

The creation of crypto-assets is controlled by the _issuers_ of crypto. MiCAR
will introduce rules that apply to the issuers of specific types of crypto
that are linked to official currencies or other assets. These are known as
stablecoins.

Other cryptocurrencies continue to be unregulated in how they are issued, for
example, the way they are ‘mined’ (created).

The [ Central Bank of Ireland ](https://www.centralbank.ie/) is responsible
for implementing the regulations in Ireland.
