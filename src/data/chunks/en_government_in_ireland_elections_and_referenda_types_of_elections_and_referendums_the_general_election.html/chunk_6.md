##  General election posters and campaigning

Once the date of a general election has been set, candidates will canvass for
your vote. This can involve calling from door to door, sending out election
leaflets, putting up posters, and televised debates and party political
broadcasts.

There are strict rules governing how parties and candidates campaign for an
election. There are also laws governing how much money can be spent by
candidates and parties.
