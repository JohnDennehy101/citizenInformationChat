##  Introduction

Ireland is a parliamentary democracy, which means the people of Ireland decide
who will represent them in [ _Dáil Éireann_ ](/en/government-in-
ireland/houses-of-the-oireachtas/dail-eireann/) (the lower house of the
_Oireachtas,_ or Irish parliament), and which political party or parties will
form the government.

Members of the Dáil are called TDs ( _Teachta Dála_ ) and the head of
government is the [ _Taoiseach_
](../../national_government/the_irish_government/the_taoiseach.en.html) . The
upper house of the Oireachtas is [ the _Seanad_ ](/en/government-in-
ireland/houses-of-the-oireachtas/the-seanad/) .

Under Irish law, the Dáil cannot continue for longer than 5 years. The
President dissolves the Dáil, usually on the advice of the Taoiseach. See ‘How
often are general elections held’ below.

The [ Constitution ](/en/government-in-ireland/irish-
constitution-1/constitution-introduction/) states there must be a TD for every
20,000 to 30,000 people in the population. Following the general election in
2020, there are 160 TDs serving 39 constituencies. A TD’s constituency is the
area that they are elected to represent.

You can vote in a general election if you are:

  * An Irish or British citizen 
  * Aged 18 or over on the day of the election 
  * [ Registered to vote ](/en/government-in-ireland/elections-and-referenda/voting/registering-to-vote/)
