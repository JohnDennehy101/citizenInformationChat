##  Tax credit certificate

Your tax credit certificate shows the rate of tax that applies to your income
and the tax credits you are entitled to. You can view, print or download your
tax credit certificate through [ myAccount ](https://www.ros.ie/myaccount-
web/home.html) .

At the start of the tax year, Revenue will automatically issue you a new tax
credit certificate. Employers are given a [ Revenue Payroll Notification (RPN)
](https://www.revenue.ie/en/employing-people/becoming-an-employer-and-ongoing-
obligations/employer-obligations-from-01-01-2019/revenue-payroll-
notification.aspx) , so they can deduct the correct amount of tax. If your
circumstances change during the year, Revenue will update your tax credit
certificate and RPN.

Your tax credit certificate and RPN tells your employer whether to calculate
the tax you owe using:

  * Cumulative basis 
  * Week 1 basis 
  * Temporary basis or emergency tax 

We explain each below.
