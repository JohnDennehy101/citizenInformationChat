##  Tax rates, tax bands and the standard rate cut-off point

Tax is charged as a percentage of your income. The percentage that you pay
depends on your income.

The first part of your income, up to a certain amount, is taxed at 20%. This
is known as the _standard rate of tax_ and the amount that it applies to is
known as the _standard rate tax band_ .

The rest of your income is taxed at the _higher rate of tax_ , 40%.

The amount that you can earn before you start to pay the higher rate of tax is
known as your _standard rate cut-off point_ . You can see [ examples of how to
calculate income tax ](/en/money-and-tax/tax/income-tax/case-study-
calculating-your-income-tax-case-studies/) using these tax rates and the
standard rate cut-off point.

If you are married or in a [ civil partnership

partnerships/civil-partnerships/) , it may affect your tax bands and tax
reliefs. [ Read more about taxation of married people and civil partners
