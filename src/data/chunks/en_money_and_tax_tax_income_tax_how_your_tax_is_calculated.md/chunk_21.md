###  Week 1 basis

In certain cases Revenue may tell the employer to deduct tax on a week 1
(people paid weekly) or month 1 basis (people paid monthly). This is sometimes
called the ‘non-cumulative basis’.

It means that the pay for each period is dealt with on its own, separate from
previous weeks or months. Your employer will deduct income tax from your pay
on a week-to-week basis.

Your yearly tax credits and cut off points are not backdated to 1 January and
do not accumulate for each pay period. This means you could be [ overpaying
tax ](/en/money-and-tax/tax/income-tax/paye-overpayments-and-underpayments-of-
tax/) .

Revenue has information on [ how and why you may be taxed on a week 1 basis

job/week-1-basis.aspx) .
