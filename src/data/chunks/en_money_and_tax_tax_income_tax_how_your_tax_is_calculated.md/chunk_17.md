####  **Example**

A  marginal-rate tax allowance  of €1,000 would reduce your tax by:

  * €200 if you pay income tax at the standard rate of 20% 
  * €400 if you also pay income tax at the higher rate of 40% 

Your standard rate tax credits are increased by €200 (€1,000 x 20% standard
rate). This is the amount of the benefit if you pay tax at the standard rate.

If you also pay tax at the higher rate, the higher rate of relief is applied
by increasing the standard rate cut-off point by €1,000. This means that
€1,000 which would otherwise be taxed at a rate of 40% is instead taxed at
20%, a saving of €200 (€400 – 200). This is in addition to the €200 saved by
the increase in tax credits, giving a total of €400.

This increase in the standard rate cut-off point has no effect if you pay tax
only at the standard rate, so you would only benefit from the increased tax
credits of €200.
