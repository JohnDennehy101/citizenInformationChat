###  Cumulative basis

Most people are taxed on a cumulative basis which makes sure that your tax and
USC liability is spread out evenly over the year. Under the cumulative basis,
your tax liability is calculated based on your total income from the start of
the tax year.

If a tax credit or standard rate cut off point (or both) are not used in full
in a pay period, the unused amount can be carried forward and used in the next
pay period within that tax year.
