####  What is USC?

The Universal Social Charge (USC) is another tax on your income. It is charged
on your gross income. Gross income is the total amount of your income before
deductions such as pension contributions or [ PRSI ](/en/social-welfare/irish-
social-welfare-system/social-insurance-prsi/social-insurance/) are taken out.

Unlike income tax, USC is not reduced by tax reliefs (except for certain
capital allowances). [ Find out more about the Universal Social Charge
