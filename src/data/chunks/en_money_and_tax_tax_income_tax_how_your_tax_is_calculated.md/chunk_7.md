###  Example of standard rate cut-off point for a married couple or civil
partners with two incomes

In 2024, the standard rate cut-off point for a married couple or civil
partners is €51,000. If both are working, this amount is increased by the
lower of:

  * The income of the lower earner 
  * €33,000 

This means that one person can have a cut-off point of up to €51,000 and the
other person can have a cut-off point of up to €33,000.

Take an example where one person is earning €55,000 and their spouse is
earning €35,000.

The standard rate cut-off point for the couple is €51,000 plus an increase of
€33,000.

The increase in the standard rate band is not transferable between spouses, so
the tax bands for 2024 would be:

  * €51,000 @ 20% (= €10,200) and €4,000 @ 40% (= €1,600) for the first spouse 
  * €33,000 @ 20% (= €6,600) and €2,000 @ 40% (= €800) for the second spouse
