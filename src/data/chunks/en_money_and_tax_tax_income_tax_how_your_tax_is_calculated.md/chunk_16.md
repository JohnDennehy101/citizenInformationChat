###  Increased cut-off point

Your standard rate cut-off point may be raised to reduce the amount of tax you
pay at the higher rate, for example, if you have marginal-rate tax allowances.

Marginal-rate tax allowances reduce the amount of tax you pay:

  * At the standard rate, by increasing your tax credits by the amount of the relief at 20% (the standard rate) 
  * At the higher rate, by increasing the standard rate cut-off point to reduce the amount of income taxed at the 40% higher rate
