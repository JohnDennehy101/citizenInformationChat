###  Decreased cut-off point

Your standard rate cut-off point may be lowered in order to increase the
amount of your income taxed at the higher rate. This could happen, for
example, if most of your income is from your employer but you also have other
sources of income from which tax has not been deducted. By lowering the cut-
off point, the other income is taken into account in your employment
deductions.

**Benefits in kind and non-PAYE income** increase the amount of tax you pay
by:

  * Decreasing tax credits by 20% of the amount of the income (the standard rate) _and_
  * Decreasing the standard rate cut-off point by the amount of the income 

This has the opposite effect to the example above. For example, for €1,000
this would:

  * Decrease the tax credits by €200 (€1,000 x 20%), affecting both standard and higher rate taxpayers and 
  * Decrease the standard rate cut-off point by €1,000, increasing the tax liability for higher rate taxpayers only. The effect of this is that €1,000 would be taxed at 40% instead of 20%, an increase of €200.
