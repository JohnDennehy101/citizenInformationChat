##  Tax allowances

Tax allowances reduce the amount of tax you must pay. The amount by which a
tax allowance will reduce your tax depends on what your highest rate of tax
is.

This is because the allowance is subtracted from your income before it is
taxed. In effect, it is ‘taken off the top’ of your income. The remainder of
your income is then taxed at the standard rate and, for any amount over  the
standard rate cut-off  , the higher rate of tax.

If, for example, you have a tax allowance of €200 and the highest rate of
income tax you pay is 20%, the amount of your income that is taxed at 20% is
reduced by €200. So your tax is reduced by €40 (€200 x 20%).

If you have the same tax allowance of €200 but the highest rate of tax that
you pay is 40%, then the amount of your income that is taxed at 40% is reduced
by €200. So your tax reduction is €80 (€200 x 40%).

This is known as tax allowance at the _marginal rate_ .

Allowances at the marginal rate include:

  * [ Tax relief on pension contributions ](/en/money-and-tax/personal-finance/pensions/)
  * [ Tax relief on nursing home expenses ](https://www.revenue.ie/en/personal-tax-credits-reliefs-and-exemptions/health-and-age/health-expenses/nursing-home-and-additional-nursing-care-expenses.aspx)
  * [ Tax relief on employing a carer for an incapacitated person ](/en/money-and-tax/tax/tax-credits-and-reliefs-for-people-with-disabilities/tax-relief-for-employing-a-home-carer/)
  * [ Seafarer's Allowance ](/en/money-and-tax/tax/income-tax-credits-and-reliefs/employment-tax-credits-and-reliefs/)

When your employer is calculating your income tax, marginal-rate allowances
are applied by [ raising your standard rate cut-off point
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/money-and-tax/tax/income-tax/how-your-
tax-is-calculated/#61fb30) , which reduces the amount of income taxed at the
higher rate.
