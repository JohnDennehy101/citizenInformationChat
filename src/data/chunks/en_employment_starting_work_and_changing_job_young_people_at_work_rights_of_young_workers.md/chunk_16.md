###  Minimum wage

Since 1 January 2024, the [ national minimum wage ](/en/employment/employment-
rights-and-conditions/pay-and-employment/minimum-wage/) is €12.70 per hour.
However, not everyone is automatically entitled to get this.

Workers under 18 are only guaranteed up to 70% of the national minimum wage,
which is €8.89 per hour. Your employer can pay you more than the minimum wage
if they want, but they are not required to do so by law.
