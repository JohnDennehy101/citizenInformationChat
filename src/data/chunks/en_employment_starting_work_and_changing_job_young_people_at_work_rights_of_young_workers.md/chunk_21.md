##  How to make a complaint

If you have a complaint about a breach of your employment rights, you should
first discuss it with your employer. If you cannot resolve your complaint, you
can make a complaint under the Protection of Young Persons (Employment) Act
1996 to the [ Workplace Relations Commission (WRC)
](/en/employment/enforcement-and-redress/enforcement-employment-rights-
legislation/) .

If you think you have been punished because you won’t break the rules (for
example, by refusing to work prohibited hours), then your parent or guardian
can [ make a complaint to the WRC ](/en/employment/enforcement-and-
redress/adjudication-employment-rights-disputes-and-complaints/) on your
behalf.

You should make the complaint within 6 months of the event, using the WRC’s [
online complaint form
](https://www.workplacerelations.ie/en/complaints_disputes/refer_a_dispute_make_a_complaint/)
.

If you need more help you can contact the [ WRC Information and Customer
Services, ](https://www.workplacerelations.ie/en/what-we-do/employment-rights-
