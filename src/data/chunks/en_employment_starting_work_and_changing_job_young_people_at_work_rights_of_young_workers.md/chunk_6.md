###  **Extra protections for young workers**

Because young workers usually balance work with education, they are protected
by extra employment laws than adults. This is to make sure their work does not
put their health or education at risk.

For example, the law for young workers:

  * Sets minimum age limits for employment 
  * Sets maximum working hours 
  * Bans anyone under 18 from doing late-night work 
  * Requires young workers to get specific rest periods 
  * Requires employers to keep specified records for workers under 18
