##  Introduction

As an EU citizen you can come to Ireland to look for work, and you can take up
employment or self-employment without needing an employment permit. This also
applies to citizens of European Economic Area (EEA) and Switzerland.

The [ EEA ](/en/government-in-ireland/european-government/european-
union/european-union/) is made up of the member states of the EU, plus Norway,
Iceland and Liechtenstein.

UK citizens can live and work in Ireland as part of the [ Common Travel Area
](/en/government-in-ireland/ireland-and-the-uk/common-travel-area-between-
ireland-and-the-uk/) .
