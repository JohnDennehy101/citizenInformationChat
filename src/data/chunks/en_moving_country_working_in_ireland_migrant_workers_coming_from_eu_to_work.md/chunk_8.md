##  Social security and tax

When you are offered a job, or if you want to start your own business, you
will need to get a [ Public Personal Services Number ](/en/social-
welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/personal-public-service-number/) (PPS
number). You also must register with Revenue. Find out more about [ starting
work in Ireland ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/employment/starting-
work-and-changing-job/starting-work/tax-and-starting-work/) .

As an employee, your employer will make deductions from your pay for tax and
social insurance. The [ amount you pay ](/en/money-and-tax/tax/income-tax/how-
your-tax-is-calculated/) depends on your salary and your circumstances (for
example, if you are married). Your employer must give you a [ payslip
](/en/employment/employment-rights-and-conditions/pay-and-employment/pay-
slip/) , which will set out these deductions:

  * PAYE: _Pay As You Earn_ – this is income tax 
  * USC: _Universal Social Charge_ – this is another tax 
  * PRSI: _Pay Related Social Insurance_ – this is social insurance 

PRSI contributes to your pension, and if you become unemployed or ill, you may
be able to claim a social welfare payment based on your PRSI contributions.
You can [ combine social insurance contributions ](/en/social-welfare/irish-
social-welfare-system/claiming-a-social-welfare-payment/social-insurance-
contributions-from-abroad/) that you made in another EEA country to qualify
for Irish benefits.

If you are self-employed, you must [ pay your own taxes ](/en/money-and-
tax/tax/income-tax/taxation-of-self-employed-people/) and social insurance by
making an annual tax return.
