##  Residence rights for you and your family

EU, EEA and Swiss citizens can [ travel to Ireland ](/en/government-in-
ireland/european-government/european-union/freedom-of-movement-in-the-eu/)
without a visa. You must have a passport or national identity card to enter
Ireland. Ireland is not part of [ the Schengen Area ](/en/government-in-
ireland/european-government/european-union/schengen-area/) .

You can stay in Ireland for up to 6 months to look for work. You do not have
to register with Immigration Service Delivery (the Irish immigration
authorities). If you have not found work after 6 months, you can stay in
Ireland if you are able to support yourself. You are not entitled to social
welfare assistance while you are looking for a job.

However, if you were getting an unemployment payment in another EU/EEA
country, you may continue to get this paid. You should ask for a form U2 from
the country that pays you before you come to Ireland.
