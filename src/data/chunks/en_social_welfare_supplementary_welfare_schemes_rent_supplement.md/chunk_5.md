##  How to qualify for Rent Supplement

You are only eligible for Rent Supplement if you are a genuine (bona fide)
tenant and meet one of the following conditions:

  * You were getting Rent Supplement in the 12 months before the date of your application. 
  * You were living in private rented accommodation for at least 6 months (183 days) of the last 12 months, you could afford the rent at the beginning of your tenancy and you are unable to continue to pay the rent because of a substantial change in your circumstances which occurred after you started renting. You can combine time living in more than one rented accommodation to satisfy the 6 months (183 days). 

If you need help with your rent but you donâ€™t meet these conditions, you
should contact your local Intreo Centre for advice on your situation.
