###  Income taken into account for Rent Supplement

  * Net income from employment (this is gross income less PRSI and reasonable travel expenses. A [ child dependant ](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/claiming-a-social-welfare-payment/claiming-and-increase-in-your-payment-for-a-child-dependant/) in full-time education does not have their income from employment assessed as means for Rent Supplement.) 
  * Social welfare payments (for exceptions - see our page on [ calculating Rent Supplement ](/en/social-welfare/supplementary-welfare-schemes/calculating-rent-supplement/) ) 
  * Working Family Payment (WFP) 
  * Cash income (for example, spousal maintenance. Maintenance payments for children are not assessed in the means test) 
  * All income and the value of all property of which you deprived yourself to qualify for Rent Supplement 
  * Capital (for example, property except your own home, savings and investments). 

The capital value of property (except your own home), savings and investments
is assessed as follows:

**Capital value of property assessment** **Capital** |  **Weekly means assessed as**  
---|---  
First €5,000  |  Nil   
Next €10,000  |  €1 per €1,000   
Next €25,000  |  €2 per €1,000   
Any capital over €40,000  |  €4 per €1,000.   
  
Income from some sources is disregarded (not taken into account) when
calculating the amount of Rent Supplement you qualify for. You can find more
