###  Your contribution to rent (Household Contribution)

Once the amount of Rent Supplement that you qualify for has been worked out,
it will be reduced by a minimum of €30. This is because you must pay at least
€30 a week towards your rent. You may pay more than €30 because you must
contribute any additional assessable means you have above the appropriate
basic Supplementary Welfare Allowance rate towards your rent.

A couple claiming Rent Supplement must pay at least €40 a week towards their
rent.

Any non-dependent household members who are solely dependent on a personal
social welfare payment must also contribute €30. However, if [ benefit and
privilege ](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/means-test-for-
social-welfare-payments/how-parents-income-can-affect-jobseekers-allowance/)
has been assessed against their social welfare payment, they do not have to
contribute €30.

If the non-dependent household members are a couple, their contribution is
€40. A couple over 65, with an income equal to or less than the State Pension
(Contributory) for their situation, will contribute €40 a week towards their
rent. A couple who both have State Pensions (Contributory) and no other income
will also contribute €40 towards their weekly rent.
