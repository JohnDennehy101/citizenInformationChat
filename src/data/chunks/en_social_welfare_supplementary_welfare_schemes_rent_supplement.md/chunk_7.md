###  Employment and Rent Supplement

You will **not** qualify for Rent Supplement if you are in full-time
employment (defined as 30 hours or more a week). In the case of couples, if
one of a couple is in full-time employment, both are excluded from claiming
Rent Supplement.

Claims from self-employed people are assessed on the individual circumstances
of the case and you may be asked to show that you are working less than 30
hours a week. If you are working over 30 hours a week in employment or self-
employment, or if you are getting the Back to Work Enterprise Allowance, you
can only continue to get Rent Supplement if your local authority considers
that you eligible for the [ Rental Accommodation Scheme (RAS)
