##  Can I apply if I live abroad?

If you are living abroad, you can apply in the same way as someone living in
Ireland – that is, using the [ online application portal
](https://www.paymentscheme.ie/en-US/) or [ by post if you prefer to use a
paper form ](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/685bd-how-to-apply-to-the-
payment-scheme/) .

Or you can call +353 1 522 9992 or contact your local embassy or consulate to
receive a paper copy of the form. You can find [ a list of Irish embassies and
consulates ](https://www.ireland.ie/en/dfa/embassies/) on the Department of
Foreign Affairs website.

Regardless of where you are living, the financial payments from this scheme
are awarded in the same way.

The services available through the enhanced medical card cannot be used
outside of Ireland. So, if you live abroad, you can apply for a health support
payment valued at €3,000, instead of the enhanced medical card. If you live
outside Ireland and still wish to receive an enhanced medical card (in case
you return to Ireland either temporarily or permanently) you will need a
Personal Public Service number (PPS). To benefit from the services offered by
the enhanced medical card, you must be registered with a GP in Ireland.
