##  The Registry of Deeds system

If property title or ownership is not registered with the Land Registry, it is
known as _unregistered property._ The Registry of Deeds records the existence
of deeds and conveyances of unregistered property.

When a deed is lodged in the Registry of Deeds it must have an ROD application
form, which gives a summary of the deed. The Registry of Deeds file the ROD
application form as a permanent record of the property transaction. The
property deeds are returned to the person who lodged them, they are not filed
with the Registry of Deeds.

An ROD application form (previously known as a memorial) contains:

  * The date of the deed 
  * The names and descriptions of all parties and all witnesses to the deed 
  * A description of the property 

The new signed deed becomes the latest deed showing the ownership of the
property, adding to a chain of deeds that go back to when the property was
first registered. Deeds that are recorded in the Registry of Deeds have a
legal priority over unrecorded deeds and other deeds recorded at a later time.

You can [ inspect an ROD application form

records/) to see who owns an unregistered property. However, if you are buying
unregistered land, you must read the actual deeds to examine the title to the
property.
