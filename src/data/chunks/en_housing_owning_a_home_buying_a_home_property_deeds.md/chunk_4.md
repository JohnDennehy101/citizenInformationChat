##  Registering property ownership with the Land Registry

When title or ownership of property is registered with the [ Land Registry
](https://www.tailte.ie/registration/land-registry/land-registration-in-
ireland/) , the Land Registry files the deeds and enters details about the
property and its ownership on _folios._

A folio:

  * Describes the registered property 
  * Refers to a plan on the Land Registry maps 
  * Gives the name and address of the registered owner 
  * Describes any burdens on the property, for example, [ rights of way ](/en/housing/owning-a-home/home-owners/right-of-way/) , fishing rights or mortgages 

Property registered at the Land Registry on a folio is known as _registered
land_ . The folio is guaranteed by the State to be a confirmed record of the
ownership of the property. Applications to register title must be made by
qualified legal practitioners.
