##  What are property title and deeds?

Property title is the legal way of saying you own property or land. Property
deeds are the legal documents used to transfer the ownership of property from
one person to another.

If you are buying or selling a property you will come across these terms.
However, usually your solicitor will look after recording the property
transaction and change of ownership when you buy or sell a home.
