###  **How do I find out who owns a property**

You can use a folio to find out who owns a property, without having to read
the original deeds. You can:

  * Search for a folio or map on [ landdirect.ie ](https://www.landdirect.ie/pramap.aspx/) . It costs €5 to view a folio. 
  * Inspect a plain copy of a folio in Tailte Éireann’s public offices. This costs €5. 
  * Request a certified copy of a folio or folio and map. This costs €40. 

You can search using a person's name, an address or by using the maps on [
landdirect.ie ](https://www.landdirect.ie/index) . There is more information
about this in Tailte Eireann’s [ FAQs on Land Registry
](https://www.tailte.ie/registration/land-registry/frequently-asked-
questions/) .
