If you are an Irish citizen, you have access to healthcare under the [ Common
Travel Area ](/en/government-in-ireland/ireland-and-the-uk/common-travel-area-
between-ireland-and-the-uk/) while visiting the UK. However, other EU citizens
should continue to use the EHIC, which is still accepted in the UK.
