###  EU and Europe

You can use your European Health Insurance Card in any European Union or
European Economic Area (EEA) country and in Switzerland. Currently, the EEA
comprises of the 27 member states of the European Union together with Iceland,
Norway, and Liechtenstein.

As Andorra and Monaco are not part of the EU or EEA, your EHIC is not accepted
there. You should get private health insurance instead.
