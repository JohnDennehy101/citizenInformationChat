###  How can I get a refund from the HSE if I paid for healthcare while
abroad?

You may be able to get a refund if you had to pay because you did not have
your EHIC card with you or because the healthcare providers charged you by
mistake.

Apply for a refund by email. Send your receipts to [ E126.Refunds@hse.ie
](mailto:E126.Refunds@hse.ie) . Or email them to [ overseas.medservices@hse.ie
](mailto:overseas.medservices@hse.ie) if you live in Dublin, Wicklow or
Kildare.

The HSE will send an E126 form to the health authorities in the other state to
find out:

  * If you used a public health service 
  * How much of a refund is due 

When the HSE receive the completed E126 form from the other state, the HSE can
see if a refund is due or not. Further information is available on the [ HSE
website ](http://www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/1/schemes/E126/) .
