##  Trying out alternative jobs

If you accept the offer of alternative work, you can get a 4-week trial period
to see if the work is suitable.

The trial period can be longer than 4 weeks if you and your employer agree
this in writing (for example, if you need training to do the new job).

You can try out an alternative role without giving up your right to redundancy
pay.

If the alternative role means your hours or pay have been reduced by 50% or
more, you can do the role for up to 52 weeks without it counting as your
acceptance.
