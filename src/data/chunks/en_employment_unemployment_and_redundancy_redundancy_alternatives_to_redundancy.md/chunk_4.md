##  What is a reasonable alternative?

What is reasonable depends on the facts of each case.

Generally, an alternative is not reasonable if you:

  * Lose status (for example, you were a senior manager and are offered a junior role) 
  * Have worse terms and conditions of employment (for example, lower pay) 
  * Have to travel an unreasonable distance to work
