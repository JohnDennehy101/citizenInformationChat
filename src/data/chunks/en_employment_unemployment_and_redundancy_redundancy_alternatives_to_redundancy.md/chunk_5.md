##  Your options if your employer offers you another job

If your employer makes you an alternative job offer you can:

  * Accept the alternative job offer 
  * Take up the alternative job on a trial basis 
  * Refuse the alternative job offer 

You **are not entitled to claim redundancy** if you:

  * Accept a new contract or re-engagement with immediate effect, and the terms of employment are the same as your previous contract 
  * Accept an offer in writing from your employer for a new and different contract which will start within 4 weeks of your previous contract ending 

You **may lose your entitlement to a redundancy payment** if you refuse a
reasonable alternative job offer without good reason.
