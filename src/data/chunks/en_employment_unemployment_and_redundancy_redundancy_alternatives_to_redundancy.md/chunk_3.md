###  How you should get an alternative job offer

Your employer should give you any offer of alternative work **in writing** if
they want to rely on the offer to avoid making a redundancy payment.

You are entitled to full information about the offer. The job must actually be
offered to you - you should not have to apply. The new job must start within 4
weeks of the old job ending.
