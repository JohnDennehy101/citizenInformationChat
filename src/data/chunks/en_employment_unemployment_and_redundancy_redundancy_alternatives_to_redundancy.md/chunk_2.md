##  Being offered ‘alternative work’

Your employer must consult with you before deciding to make you [ redundant
](/en/employment/unemployment-and-redundancy/redundancy/what-is-redundancy/) .
This will normally involve:

  * Speaking to you about why you have been selected 
  * Looking at any alternatives to redundancy 

Before your employer makes you redundant, they might offer you another job in
the business. This is known as ‘alternative work’.

The alternative work should be a reasonable offer. Generally speaking,
alternatives which involve you losing status or getting worse terms and
conditions would not be reasonable.

You may not be entitled to claim a redundancy payment if your employer offers
you suitable alternative work which you refuse without good reason.
