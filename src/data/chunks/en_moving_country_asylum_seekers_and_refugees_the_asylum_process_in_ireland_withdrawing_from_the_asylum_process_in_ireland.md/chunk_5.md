##  Subsequent application

If your application for international protection has been withdrawn or is
deemed withdrawn, but you want to apply again, you may be able to make a
subsequent application. You must first apply to the Minister for permission to
the making of a subsequent application.

You could get permission to make a subsequent application if your previous
application was withdrawn or deemed withdrawn through no fault of your own,
and you could not pursue your previous application as a result.

If the Minister consents to the making of a subsequent application, you should
make the application within 10 working days.

If the Minister does not consent to the making of a subsequent application,
you can appeal this refusal within 10 working days from the date of the
notification. The decision in this appeal will be made without an oral
hearing.
