##  Appeals deemed to have been withdrawn

Your [ appeal to IPAT ](/en/moving-country/asylum-seekers-and-refugees/the-
asylum-process-in-ireland/if-your-application-for-refugee-status-is-refused/)
can be deemed to have been withdrawn in certain circumstances. This means that
your appeal is treated as if you withdrew it because you have failed to do
something.

If you fail to attend an oral hearing and you have not given IPAT a good
reason that you could not attend within 3 working days after the date of the
hearing, your appeal will be deemed withdrawn.

If you have failed in your duty to co-operate with the appeal procedure, IPAT
will write to you and give you 10 days to confirm in writing that you want to
continue with the appeal. If you do not confirm you want to continue your
appeal, your appeal will be deemed to have been withdrawn. If you send
confirmation that you want to continue your appeal, but you then fail in your
duties again, IPAT may deem your appeal to be withdrawn.

Your [ duties ](/en/moving-country/asylum-seekers-and-refugees/the-asylum-
process-in-ireland/rights-and-obligations-of-asylum-seekers-in-ireland/) are
to:

  * Submit the information that you are asked to submit 
  * Co-operate with the examination of your application 
  * Report to the authorities when required to do so 
  * Live or remain at a particular district of place when required to do so 
  * Tell the Minister your address and any change of address 
  * Not leave or attempt to leave Ireland without the consent of the Minister for Justice 

When your appeal is deemed to have been withdrawn, the Minister may arrange
for your removal from Ireland unless you have other permission to remain in
the State, or you have agreed to leave voluntarily.
