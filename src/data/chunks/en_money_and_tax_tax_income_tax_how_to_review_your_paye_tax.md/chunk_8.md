There are various [ reasons why you may have underpaid tax
](https://www.revenue.ie/en/jobs-and-pensions/end-of-year-
process/underpayment-position.aspx) .

If your Statement of Liability shows that you owe tax of less than €6,000, you
have the option to:

  * Pay all or part of it through myAccount 
  * Pay all or the remaining part of it by having your tax credits reduced for up to 4 years. 

If the amount you owe is over €6,000, you can pay the amount through myAccount
or contact Revenue to discuss repayment options.
