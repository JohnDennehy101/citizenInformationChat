####  **Step 2**

Second, you must calculate Peter’s ‘notional rate of pension’. This is the
rate of State Pension (Contributory) Peter would be entitled to if all his
contributions were assessed as Irish contributions.

You can calculate this by dividing the total number of contributions, both
Irish and foreign (1,560), by the total number of years worked since entering
insurable employment (40).

**Yearly average number of contributions calculation** Total assessable contributions  |  364 Irish contributions + 1,196 German contributions = 1,560   
---|---  
Total number of years worked*  |  40   
Yearly average number of contributions  |  1,560 ÷ 40 = **39**  
  
*since entering insurable employment to the end of the last complete tax year before reaching pension age 

Peter's yearly average number of contributions is 39, so his notional rate of
pension is €249.30 (in 2024, this is the rate paid for people with a yearly
average of 30-39 contributions).

However, Peter is also entitled to an increase in his payment for his wife,
but he is not entitled to the maximum rate of increase for a qualified adult
because she is earning €250 per week.

The rate of qualified adult increase payable is tapered for earnings between
€100 and €310. The increase for his wife as a qualified adult is €71.70.

To get Peter’s total notional pension rate, add the first notional rate of
pension (€249.30) to the increase he gets for his wife (€71.70).

**Total notional pension rate calculation** Notional rate of pension (calculated above)  |  €249.30   
---|---  
Increase for a qualified adult  |  €71.70   
Total notional pension rate  |  €249.30 + €71.70 = **€321**  
  
Peter’s total notional pension rate is €321.
