####  **Step 3**

Third, you calculate what pension Peter would get under EU social security
agreements. You can do this by applying the following formula:

  * (A x B) ÷ C = rate of State Pension (Contributory) 

**Figures for pension calculation** A = Notional rate of pension (calculated in step 2)  |  €321   
---|---  
B = Number of Irish contributions  |  364   
C = Total number of contributions (Irish and foreign)  |  1,560   
  
First, you multiply the notional rate of pension (A) by the total number of
Irish contributions (B):

  * €321 x 364 = €116,844 

Then, you divide €116,844 by the total number of Irish and foreign
contributions (C):

  * €116,844 ÷ 1,560 = €74.38 

**Peter’s rate of State Pension (Contributory), calculated under EU security
agreements and including an increase for his wife as a qualified dependant, is
€74.38.**
