###  Case study

Peter is turning 66 years of age in 2024 and wants to know if he will qualify
for a State Pension (Contributory).

Peter entered insurable employment 40 years ago. He started his working life
in Ireland and worked in Ireland for 2 years in total. He has worked in
Ireland for the last 5 years and before that he worked in Germany for 23 years
and paid 1,196 contributions there.

He doesn't have any breaks in his employment record in Germany, that is, he
worked in Germany continuously for 23 years immediately before coming back to
Ireland. He therefore has 364 Irish contributions and 1,196 German
contributions.

Peter's wife Maria is 61 years of age, her only income is from work. She earns
â‚¬250 per week.
