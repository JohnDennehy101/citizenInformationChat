####  **Step 1**

First, you must check whether Peter would qualify for an Irish State Pension
based on his Irish contributions alone.

You can calculate this by dividing the total number of Irish contributions
(364) by the total number of years worked (40) since entering insurable
employment.

**Yearly average number of contributions calculation** Peter’s Irish contributions  |  364   
---|---  
Total number of years worked*  |  40   
Yearly average number of contributions  |  364 ÷ 40 = **9.1**  
  
*since entering into insurable employment to the end of the last complete tax year before reaching pension age 

Peter's yearly average number of contributions is 9.1. He would not qualify
for an Irish State Pension (Contributory).
