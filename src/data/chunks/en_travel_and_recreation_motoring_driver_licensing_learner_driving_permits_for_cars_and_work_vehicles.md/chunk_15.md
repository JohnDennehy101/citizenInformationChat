###  **Rules**

Once you get your IBT Certificate of Satisfactory Completion, you are allowed
to drive unaccompanied on public roads.

However, a learner permit is not a full motorcycle driving licence and there
are specific rules you must keep to until you pass your driving test:

  * You must display L plates. The L plates for a motorcyclist are displayed on a yellow fluorescent hi-viz tabard (a bib or sleeveless top with open side-seams). The letter L must be in red, measure at least 15cm in height on a white background, and be visible on the front and back of your body. 
  * You cannot drive on a motorway 
  * You cannot carry pillion passengers (passengers on the back of your motorcycle) 
  * You must keep to a [ reduced drink driving limit ](/en/travel-and-recreation/motoring/driving-offences/drink-driving-offences-in-ireland/) and [ penalty point disqualification threshold ](/en/travel-and-recreation/motoring/driving-offences/penalty-points-for-driving-offences/) . 

You can read more about [ how to arrange and prepare for a motorcycle driving
test ](/en/travel-and-recreation/motoring/driving-tests/driving-test/) .
