##  The role of the chief executive

Every local authority has a chief executive (formerly called a county or city
manager) who is employed to manage their local authority. Some local
authorities share a chief executive. As well as the chief executive, some
councils also have deputy chief executives.

The chief executive performs the executive functions of the city council,
county council or city and county council. They supervise, co-ordinate, manage
and pay the employees and officers of the council. They also makes contracts
on behalf of the council and affixes the official seal of the council on
documents.

Once appointed, the chief executive will remain in office for a term of 7
years (although this can also be extended by an additional 3 years).

The chief executive makes decisions on the running of the local authority,
except those that are reserved decisions (decisions that are made by the
elected councillors). These include:

  * Granting or refusing planning permission 
  * Allocating local authority housing 
  * Signing contracts 
  * Managing the staff of the local authority 
  * The day to day running of the local authority
