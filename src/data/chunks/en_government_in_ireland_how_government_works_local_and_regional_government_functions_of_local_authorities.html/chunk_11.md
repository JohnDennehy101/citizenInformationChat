##  Elected councillors

The members of each local authority are called 'councillors'. Councillors are
directly elected in [ local elections ](/en/government-in-ireland/elections-
and-referenda/types-of-elections-and-referendums/local-elections/) . The
number of councillors elected to each local authority depends on the
population of the local authority area.

Local elections by law are held in the month of May or June on a day fixed by
the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage

Each councillor holds office for 5 years, Councillors elected in May 2019 will
hold office until 7 days after the polling day in 2024.

The number of members of each local authority is fixed by law. This means that
Schedule 7 of the [ Local Government Act 2001
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2001/en/act/pub/0037/index.html) , as amended
by [ Section 15 of the Local Government Reform Act 2014
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2014/en/act/pub/0001/sec0015.html#sec15) ,
has set down the number of members of every county council, city council and
city and county council throughout the country.

The Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage may divide each city
or county area into smaller local electoral areas and may fix the number of
councillors that can be elected for each of these electoral areas.

Before making changes to an electoral area, the Minister requests a boundary
committee to prepare a report of recommendations. View the most recent [
boundary committee reports. ](https://www.housing.gov.ie/local-
