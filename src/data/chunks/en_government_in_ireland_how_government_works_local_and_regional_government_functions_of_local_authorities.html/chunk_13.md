###  Resolutions and bye-laws

Local authorities make decisions about policies by passing ‘resolutions’.
Resolutions are passed by councillors and are known as reserved functions of
the local authority. Resolutions can include:

  * Decisions about annual budgets 
  * Housing policy 
  * Environmental protection policies 

Local authorities can pass laws where they are empowered to do so by the
_Oireachtas_ (the Irish parliament). These laws are called bye-laws and are
often used to regulate:

  * Parking zones and parking fines 
  * Litter control 
  * The control of horses and dogs 

Two months before making a Bye-Law, the local authority must publish a notice
in a local newspaper indicating that it proposes to make the Bye-Law. The
public is entitled to inspect the proposed Bye-Law and make submissions about
it before it comes into effect.
