###  What do councillors do?

Councillors make decisions at council meetings. There are 4 different types of
meetings held by the local authority:

  * An annual meeting (held in May/June each year) 
  * Ordinary meetings (usually held at least monthly) 
  * A budget meeting (usually towards the end of the year) 
  * A special meeting (held occasionally) 

At the council meeting, every councillor is entitled to vote for or against
resolutions put forward at the meeting. In most cases, a resolution is passed
where the majority of the members present vote in favour of the resolution.
