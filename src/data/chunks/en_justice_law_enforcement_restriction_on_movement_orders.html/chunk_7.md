##  Can I have more than one restriction on movement order placed on me?

Yes, you can. However, if more than one restriction order is running, the
period of time that you must stay at a place or places cannot be more than 6
months.

Where restriction orders are imposed for two or more offences, they may be:

  * Concurrent – meaning they run at the same time, or 
  * Consecutive – meaning the second order will only begin when the first order finishes.
