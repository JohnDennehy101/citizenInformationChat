##  Introduction

If you are convicted of certain minor offences, the courts can restrict your
movements instead of sending you to prison.

These restrictions are known as _restriction on movement_ _orders_ under [
Section 101 of the Criminal Justice Act 2006
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2006/en/act/pub/0026/sec0101.html#sec101) .

A restriction on movement order can only be applied if you:

  * Are aged 18 years or over, and 
  * Have been convicted by the court and could be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 3 months or more. 

The court cannot impose a restriction on movement order for a period longer
than 6 months.
