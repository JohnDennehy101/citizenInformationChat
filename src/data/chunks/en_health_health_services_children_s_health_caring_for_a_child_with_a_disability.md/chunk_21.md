##  Planning for the future

Some parents choose to make extra financial provision for their child with a
disability through a will, trust or other arrangement. Although a child with a
disability may be maintained by their parents after the age of 18, this does
not provide them with any special entitlement to provision in a parentâ€™s will.

If you want to make specific provision for your child, get advice from a [
solicitor ](/en/justice/courtroom/solicitors/) or other legal professional.
You may also want to discuss the tax implications with an accountant and
Revenue.
