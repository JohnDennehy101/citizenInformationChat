###  Carers

The [ Domiciliary Care Allowance ](/en/social-welfare/disability-and-
illness/domiciliary-care-allowance/) is a monthly payment made to the carer of
a child with a severe disability who lives at home. All children getting
Domiciliary Care Allowance are eligible for a [ medical card
](/en/health/medical-cards-and-gp-visit-cards/medical-card/) without a means
test.

The main social welfare payments for full-time carers are [ Carer's Allowance
](/en/social-welfare/carers/carers-allowance/) and [ Carer's Benefit
](/en/social-welfare/carers/carers-benefit/) . You may also qualify for an
annual [ Carer's Support Grant ](/en/social-welfare/carers/carers-support-
grant/) . If you get Carer's Allowance, you are entitled to a [ Free Travel
Pass ](/en/social-welfare/extra-social-welfare-benefits/free-travel/) .

If you get other social welfare payments, you may be able to keep your main
social welfare payment and get [ half-rate Carer's Allowance ](/en/social-
welfare/carers/half-rate-carers-allowance/) as well.
