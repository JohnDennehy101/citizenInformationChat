###  Options to protect your child’s future financial well-being

**Deed of covenant:** You may use a [ deed of covenant ](/en/money-and-
tax/tax/income-tax-credits-and-reliefs/deeds-of-covenant/) as a tax-efficient
way to give money to a child aged over 18, but this could affect the child’s
entitlement to [ Disability Allowance ](/en/social-welfare/disability-and-
illness/disability-allowance/) .

**A trust:** Another option is [ a trust ](/en/money-and-tax/tax/tax-credits-
and-reliefs-for-people-with-disabilities/trust-funds-for-permanently-
incapacitated-people/) from which your child may benefit after your death.
Many parents use discretionary trusts to provide for a child with a disability
without affecting entitlement to benefits.

**Appoint a guardian:** You may [ appoint a guardian in your will ](/en/birth-
family-relationships/cohabiting-couples/legal-guardianship-and-unmarried-
couples#l065f5) . This only applies if your child is under 18 when the will
comes into effect. It is not possible to appoint a guardian for an adult
child.

**An occupational pension:** Most public sector [ occupational pension schemes
](/en/money-and-tax/personal-finance/pensions/occupational-pensions/) , and
some private sector schemes, have provisions that allow for the pension
arrangements for permanently incapacitated dependent children to continue for
the child’s lifetime. Check your pension policy to see if this applies in your
case.
