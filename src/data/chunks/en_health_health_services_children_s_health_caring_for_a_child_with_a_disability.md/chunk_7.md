##  Applying for an Assessment of Need

If your child has a disability or you think they may have a disability, you
can apply to an Assessment Officer for an [ Assessment of Need
](/en/health/health-services/health-services-for-people-with-
disabilities/assessment-of-need-for-people-with-disabilites/) . This
identifies your child's health and education needs.

Everyone born on or after 1 June 2002 who has, or may have a disability has a
right to an assessment.

After the assessment, you will get a report and a statement of the services
that will be provided for your child.

**Your child does not need an Assessment of Need to access health services.
You can apply directly to services.**
