###  Other types of vetting

Besides standard vetting, the National Vetting Bureau also manages vetting
related to Non-Act applications required by other legislation.

For example, certain bodies, such as An Garda Síochána, the Courts Service and
some government departments require applicants to disclose any spent
convictions.
