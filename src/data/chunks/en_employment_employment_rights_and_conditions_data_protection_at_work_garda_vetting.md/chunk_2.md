##  What is Garda vetting?

If you are working or volunteering with children or vulnerable adults in
Ireland, you must go through _Garda vetting_ . This process checks if you have
a criminal record, or any history that might pose a threat to vulnerable
people.

The Garda Siochána National Vetting Bureau handles the process and sends a
_vetting disclosure_ to the organisation you are involved with.

Currently, you won’t need to be re-vetted unless you change jobs or roles
within a sports or community group.

The rules for Garda vetting are set out in the [ National Vetting Bureau
(Children and Vulnerable Persons) Acts 2012-2016
](http://www.lawreform.ie/_fileupload/RevisedActs/WithAnnotations/HTML/en_act_2012_0047.htm)
.
