##  Information in your vetting disclosure

When vetted by the National Vetting Bureau, your criminal record is
_disclosed_ (revealed) to the _authorised liaison person_ in the registered
organisation (the company, body, or club you want to work for).

The liaison person will get a _vetting disclosure_ about you. This disclosure
will include:

  * Details of any convictions 
  * Details of pending prosecutions 
  * A statement of [ specified information ](https://vetting.garda.ie/VettingProcedure/SpecifiedInformation) **or** a statement that there is no criminal record or specified information relating to you 

A statement of specified information is any information that leads to a
genuine belief you pose a threat to children or vulnerable people.
