##  Requesting personal data

Garda vetting is not done for individuals on a personal basis. However, you
have the [ right to access your personal data held by the Garda Sioch√°na
](https://www.garda.ie/en/information-centre/data-protection/) .

Read more about [ how to access your personal data ](/en/government-in-
ireland/data-protection/rights-under-general-data-protection-regulation/) .

A response to your data protection access request is **not** the same as Garda
vetting, a Police Certificate, a Garda Reference, or proof of no convictions.
