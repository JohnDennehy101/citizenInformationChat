###  Student credits

Student credits are only given once and cover periods when you are in full-
time education.

To qualify, you must have:

  * Worked and paid PRSI Class A before starting your course 
  * Started your course before you reached 23 years 
  * Started before you took up full-time insurable employment 

You apply for student credits when you apply for a social insurance payment.
Student Credits can be used to help you qualify for short-term payments only
(for example, Illness Benefit and Jobseeker's Benefit). You provide written
confirmation from the school or college that you were a student there, and the
dates you attended.
