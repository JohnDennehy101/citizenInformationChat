###  Credits during unemployment

You get credits automatically if you are fully unemployed and getting
Jobseeker's Benefit. You can continue to get credits if you have used up your
entitlement to Jobseeker's Benefit and qualify for Jobseeker's Allowance.

You do not automatically get credits if you are getting Jobseeker's Allowance.
You must have paid or credited contributions in either of the last 2 tax years
to get credits with Jobseeker's Allowance.

If you are unemployed and don’t qualify for a jobseeker’s payment, you can
still sign on for credits, if you meet the qualifying conditions.
