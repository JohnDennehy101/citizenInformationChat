##  How to qualify for credited contributions

To qualify for a credited contribution _,_ you usually must meet the following
conditions.

You must have worked and have at least one paid PRSI contribution at any of
the following PRSI classes:

  * A 
  * B 
  * C 
  * D 
  * E 
  * H 
  * P 

You must have paid or credited contributions in either of the last 2 completed
tax years. For example, if you are applying for credits in 2023, you must have
paid or credited contributions in either 2022 or 2021.

If it's been more than 2 completed tax years since you had contributions,
you'll need to work and pay PRSI for a further 26 weeks before you qualify for
credited contributions.

The rules for getting credited contributions are set out in [ SI No. 312 of
1996 ](https://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1996/si/312/made/en/print) .

**Rate of credited contribution**

Credited contributions are usually given at the same rate as your last paid
PRSI contribution. This means your credit can only help you qualify for the
social insurance payments paid to your PRSI class.

For example, if your last paid PRSI contribution was Class A your credits will
also be for Class A. If it was for Class B, your credits will be for Class B.
