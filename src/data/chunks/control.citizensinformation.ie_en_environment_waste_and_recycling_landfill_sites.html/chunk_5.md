##  Waste licences

A waste licence sets out what types of waste a site can take and how it must
be monitored. The EPA can stop a landfill site from taking certain kinds of
waste if the waste licence application does not show how environmental
pollution will be prevented.

You can find submitted applications for landfill sites and waste licences on
the [ EPA website ](http://www.epa.ie/terminalfour/waste/index.jsp) .
