##  What is a landfill site?

A landfill site is a place where general rubbish is disposed of when it is not
[ recycled ](/en/environment/waste-and-recycling/recycling-household-waste/)
or [ composted ](/en/environment/waste-and-recycling/composting-domestic-
waste/) . Landfill sites are designed to protect the environment by storing
the waste material separate from the surrounding soil, groundwater and air.
However, this waste does not break down or decompose.

Before you send anything to landfill you should consider all other waste
disposal options, such as [ reducing ](/en/environment/waste-and-
recycling/reducing-waste/) , re-using and [ recycling ](/en/environment/waste-
and-recycling/recycling-household-waste/) .

Landfill sites have more protection for the environment and for local people
than traditional ‘dumps’. The site is managed carefully to control problems
such as smell, litter or vermin.
