##  Introduction

When people are [ reported missing ](/en/justice/crime-and-crime-
prevention/reporting-a-missing-person/) in Ireland, most are found and safely
reunited with their families, but a small minority remain on the [ Garda
National Missing Persons List ](https://www.garda.ie/en/missing-persons/) .

The following information explains the legal situation in Ireland regarding
the estate and possessions of a missing person if they are presumed dead.

If someone is thought to be dead but there is no body (for example, because a
person was lost at sea), all of their assets and property are usually frozen.
Two exceptions to this are:

  * Where the property is jointly owned 
  * Where someone has [ Power of Attorney ](/en/death/before-a-death/power-of-attorney/) to deal with their property or money in their absence
