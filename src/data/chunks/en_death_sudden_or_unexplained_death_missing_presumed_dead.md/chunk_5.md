###  Presumption of death order

A wide category of people can apply for a presumption of death order,
including:

  * All family members 
  * Dependants 
  * Cohabitants 

This allows beneficiaries to seek death-related entitlements and ends the
marriage or civil partnership of the missing person. Any person applying for a
presumption of death order must notify all the other persons potentially
affected by any order.

The application will normally be made in the [ Circuit Court
](/en/justice/courts-system/circuit-court/) but in certain cases will need to
be made in the [ High Court ](/en/justice/courts-system/high-court/) .

In addition, if an order is made, the applicant must take out insurance
against any losses arising if the person returns. However, the cost of this
insurance will be charged to the missing personâ€™s estate. The court can also
waive this requirement.

A court must take into account all the circumstances surrounding the
disappearance and absence of the missing person in deciding whether to make an
order, including:

  * Abandonment of valuable property 
  * Searches made after the disappearance 
  * Any possible motive for disappearing 
  * Any possibility of foul play 
  * Life insurance recently taken out by the missing person 
  * Any prior history of fraud on the part of the missing person 

There is also scope for a presumption of death order to be varied or revoked
if there is new evidence suggesting the person is alive.
