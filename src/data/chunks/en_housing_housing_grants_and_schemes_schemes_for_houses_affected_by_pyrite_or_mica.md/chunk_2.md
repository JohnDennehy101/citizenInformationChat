##  What are mica and pyrite?

Mica and pyrite are minerals found in the ground and in rocks that are
excavated from quarries and used in building blocks. These minerals cause
defects in building blocks, which lead to cracks and other problems in
buildings and homes constructed with the defective blocks.

Mica was mainly found in quarries in the north west of Ireland and some
properties in this area are affected by it. Pyrite caused similar problems in
buildings in the east of Ireland.

There are schemes in place to repair or rebuild homes that have been affected
by mica and pyrite.
