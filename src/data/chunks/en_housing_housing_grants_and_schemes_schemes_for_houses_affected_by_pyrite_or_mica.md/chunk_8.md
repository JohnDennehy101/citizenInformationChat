###  **How do I apply for the enhanced scheme?**

  1. **Get a report confirming the damage**

If you think your property has been damaged because defective concrete blocks
were used to build it, you should get a _competent building professional_ to
assess the damage.

A competent building professional is a [ building surveyor ](https://scsi.ie/)
, [ engineer ](https://www.engineersireland.ie/Professionals) or [ architect
](https://www.riai.ie/) who is listed on the statutory register for their
professional body and has done any required training.

They will assess your property and complete a building condition assessment
report. A template of the building condition assessment report is available in
[ Schedule 1 of the regulations
](https://www.gov.ie/pdf/?file=https://assets.gov.ie/262454/05313c4e-49d5-4984-b75f-316787c06643.pdf#page=null)
(pdf).

The report will recommend that you apply to your local authority for the
scheme if the damage to your property:

  * Is consistent with damage caused by defective concrete blocks 
  * Meets the damage threshold for the [ scheme (pdf) ](https://www.gov.ie/pdf/?file=https://assets.gov.ie/262454/05313c4e-49d5-4984-b75f-316787c06643.pdf#page=null)

A building condition assessment report costs approximately €500 to €750. You
pay for the report. But, if your application is successful, the grant will
cover this cost.  
  
2\. **Apply to your local authority**

If your building professional recommends it, you should apply to the local
authority for the scheme. You will need to send your building condition
assessment report to your local authority when you apply. Your local authority
will have information about how to apply on their website. They may use an
application form or an online portal.
