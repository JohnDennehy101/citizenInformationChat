###  **How are applications decided?**

The local authority will send your application and report to the [ Housing
Agency ](https://www.housingagency.ie/) . The Housing Agency will review the
documents and check that your property meets the damage threshold for the
scheme. If your property meets the damage threshold, the Housing Agency will
tell your local authority and they will inform you.

Then, the Housing Agency will get a competent engineer to assess and test your
property. The Housing Agency will use this information to decide what
remediation option applies to your property and the grant amount you will get.
The local authority will contact you to give you this information.
