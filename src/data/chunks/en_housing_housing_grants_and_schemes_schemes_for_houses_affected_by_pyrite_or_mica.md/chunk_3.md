##  What is the Enhanced Defective Concrete Blocks Grant Scheme?

The [ Enhanced Defective Concrete Blocks Grant Scheme
](https://www.gov.ie/en/service/8002e-enhanced-defective-concrete-blocks-
grant-scheme/?referrer=http://www.gov.ie/defectiveconcreteblocks/) provides
financial support to people, so they can fix properties that have been damaged
by the use of defective concrete blocks. Defective concrete blocks are blocks
that have excessive amounts of mica or pyrite.

The enhanced scheme is available in Clare, Donegal, Limerick and Mayo.

It began on 22 June 2023 replacing the original scheme.

The [ Remediation of Dwellings Damaged by the Use of Defective Concrete Blocks
Act 2022 ](https://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2022/act/28/enacted/en/html)
and the related [ regulations
