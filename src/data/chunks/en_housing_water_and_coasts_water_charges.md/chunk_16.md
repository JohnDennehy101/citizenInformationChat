[ Section 8 of the Water Services Act 2014
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2014/en/act/pub/0044/print.html#sec8)
provides for the CRU to operate a statutory [ dispute resolution service
](http://www.cer.ie/customer-care/water/complaints) to handle unresolved
complaints from customers of Irish Water. If you wish to use this service, you
must:

  * Have been a registered Irish Water customer at the time to which the complaint relates 
  * Have already made your complaint to Irish Water in writing 
  * Have completed Irish Water's complaints process and received a final decision in writing 

The CRU will issue its decision on the complaint to Irish Water. It can
require Irish Water to pay a refund or compensation. It may also require Irish
Water to comply with its decision in respect of other customers affected by
the same issue.
