###  Complaints about water quality

The Commission for Regulation of Utilities (CRU) is the economic regulator of
Irish Water. The CRU does not handle complaints about water quality. If you
have a complaint about [ water quality ](/en/housing/water-and-coasts/water-
quality/) that has not been resolved by Irish Water, you should refer it to
the [ Environmental Protection Agency ](http://www.epa.ie/) , which is the
environmental regulator of Irish Water.
