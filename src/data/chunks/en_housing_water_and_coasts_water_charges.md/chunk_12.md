###  Fixing leaks

Homeowners are legally responsible for water pipes and systems inside their
dwelling and between the dwelling and the property boundary. This means that
you would normally need to pay a plumber to fix a leak, whether it is inside
your home or on the external supply pipe between your home and the property
boundary. You can use Irish Waterâ€™s [ checklist to see if you have any
internal leaks ](http://www.water.ie/water-supply/first-fix/checking-for-
leaks/) .

Under the [ First Fix Free Scheme ](http://www.water.ie/water-supply/first-
fix/) , Irish Water will contact you by post if your water meter shows that
there might be a leak on your external supply pipe. If you are eligible for
the scheme (see below) Irish Water will offer to investigate the pipe and
repair any identified leaks for free. Generally, this will involve fully
replacing the pipe from the meter to a point as close to the dwelling as
possible.

**Who is eligible for the First Fix Scheme?**

The [ First Fix Free Scheme ](https://www.water.ie/for-home/first-fix/) is
open to Irish Water customers who have **a confirmed leak on their external
supply pipe** .

Previously, you had to be registered with Irish Water and have a water meter
with internal stop valve to access this scheme. However, in April 2021 the
scheme was extended to include customers who:

  * Are not registered with Irish Water 
  * Do not have a meter 
  * Have no internal stop valve 
  * Have a shared service connection 
  * Are mixed use customers, that mainly use their water for domestic purposes
