###  Who is a customer of Irish Water?

You are a customer of Irish Water if either or both of the following apply:

  * Your property is connected to and supplied by a public water main for water 
  * Your property is connected to and uses a public sewer for wastewater removal 

The charge is per service, so if you use both public water and wastewater
services you will be charged excess use charges for both services.

If your water comes from a private well or a group water scheme and you have a
private wastewater treatment system (such as a septic tank) you are not a
customer of Irish Water and do not have to pay excess use charges.

This table shows who is considered to be a customer of Irish Water and which
systems will be subject to excess use charges:
