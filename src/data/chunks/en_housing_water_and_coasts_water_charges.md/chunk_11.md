##  Rates and charges

Irish Water will charge €1.85 per cubic meter (1,000 litres) for usage over
the threshold (see ‘Water allowance’ above).

The charge will be capped at €250 per year for water and €250 per year for
wastewater services. So, the maximum charge for excess water usage will be
€500 per year.
