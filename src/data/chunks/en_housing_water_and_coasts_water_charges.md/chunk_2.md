##  Introduction

People who use large amounts of water at home may have to pay the Household
Water Conservation Charge for any excess water that they use.

The charge will apply to a householdâ€™s who use water above a specified
threshold. The threshold takes into account how many people live in the house.

Excess use charges are covered by the [ Water Services Act 2007-2017
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2014/en/act/pub/0044/print.html) , which
brought in several changes to water services and charges in Ireland.
