##  Introduction

Eurodac is an EU database that stores the fingerprints of international
protection applicants or people who have crossed a border illegally. It is
used by the countries of the EU and also Norway, Iceland, Lichtenstein and
Switzerland.

The purpose of Eurodac is to give member states information to help them to
decide which country is responsible for a personâ€™s [ international protection
application ](/en/moving-country/asylum-seekers-and-refugees/the-asylum-
process-in-ireland/international-protection-terms/) . If your fingerprint data
is stored on Eurodac because you previously applied for international
protection in another country, you may be returned to that country under the [
Dublin Regulations ](/en/moving-country/asylum-seekers-and-refugees/the-
asylum-process-in-ireland/dublin-convention/) .

Eurodac is equipped with a central database for comparing the fingerprints of
asylum applicants and a system for electronic data transmission between member
states and the database.
