##  Application of Eurodac in Ireland

When you make an application for international protection, you and your
dependent minors will have your photograph taken. You will also have your
fingerprints taken. Fingerprints of your dependent minors may also be taken.
Your fingerprints may be disclosed in confidence to the relevant Irish
authorities and to international protection authorities of other countries.

You must allow your fingerprints to be taken. If you do not allow your
fingerprints to be taken, you may be detained.
