###  The obligation to design and operate appropriate processing systems

The GDPR has introduced the concepts of _data protection by design_ and _data
protection by default_ .

Data protection by design means data protection measures must be included when
any system is being designed by a controller. As a result, the chances of
inadvertent breaches of data protection legislation are reduced.

Data protection by default means that systems should be set up to be data
protection friendly. This should mean the only necessary personal data is
collected, that it is kept for the minimum period necessary and that a person
is not automatically opted-in to any unnecessary processing.

Controllers can apply for certification in Ireland from the Data Protection
Commission, which will demonstrate that their processes are designed to comply
with the Regulation.
