###  The obligations relating to transferring data outside the EU

Any transfer of personal data outside the EU or to an international
organisation will be strictly regulated under the GDPR. The Regulation also
applies to any onward transfer of personal data from one non-EU member state
to another.

Such a transfer of personal data may take place where the European Commission
has decided that the non-EU member state or business sector within that
country has an adequate level of data protection in place. In deciding if
there is adequate protection, the Commission will look at that country's laws,
respect for human rights, the existence of any data protection authority and
the international commitments that country has made relating to personal data.
After deciding if a country or sector has adequate data protection, the
Commission will continue to monitor that country in terms of its data
protection practices.

The Commission publishes a list of all such approved countries, sectors and
international organisations.

If a controller or processor wants to transfer data to an **unapproved**
country, sector or international organisation, that controller or processor
must provide the appropriate safeguards and ensure that any data subjects will
still be able to exercise their rights.
