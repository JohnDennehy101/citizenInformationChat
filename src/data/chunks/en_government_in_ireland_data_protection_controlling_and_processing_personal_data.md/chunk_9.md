###  The obligation to keep data secure

Controllers and processors have an obligation to keep personal data secure.
They must also ensure that any employees do not access or process any data
unless they are required to do so. Under the GDPR, controllers and processors
must consider implementing modern security measures appropriate for the risks
involved in their activities. For example, risks may come from accidental or
unlawful destruction of stored data or unauthorised disclosure, access or
alteration.

The security measures may include anonymisation or encryption of data and
restoring or backing up stored data. Controllers and processors need to
regularly review and evaluate their security measures and also consider data
security when disposing of equipment.
