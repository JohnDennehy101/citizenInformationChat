###  The obligation to comply with codes of conduct and certification

Associations and other bodies representing controllers and processors may
prepare codes of practice that will specify how the GDPR should be
specifically applied. These bodies must submit their draft codes of conduct to
the Data Protection Commission for approval.

In order to enhance transparency and compliance with this Regulation, the GDPR
will introduce certification mechanisms and data protection marks, allowing
data subjects to quickly assess the level of data protection of relevant
products and services. A list of certified organisations will be publicly
available.

Codes of conduct and approved certification mechanisms will also assist
controllers, in identifying the risks related to their type of processing and
in adhering to best practice.

Complying with an approved code of conduct or an approved certification
mechanism may be used as an element to demonstrate compliance with the
obligations of the controller or processor under the GDPR.
