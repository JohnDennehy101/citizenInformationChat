###  Independent supervisory authorities

Under the GDPR, each EU member state must have one or more independent public
authorities responsible for monitoring the application of the Regulation. In
Ireland, this supervisory authority is the Data Protection Commission.

The Data Protection Commission:

  * Monitors and enforces the application of the GDPR 
  * Promotes public awareness of the rules and rights around data processing 
  * Advises the Government on data protection issues 
  * Promotes awareness among controllers and processors of their obligations 
  * Provides information to individuals about their data protection rights 
  * Maintains a list of processing operations requiring data protection impact assessment 
  * Handles complaints and conducts investigations related to compliance with data protection law 

The Data Protection Commission has the power to order any controller or
processor to provide information that the authority requires to assess
compliance with the Regulation. It may carry out investigations of controllers
and processors in the form of data audits, including accessing the premises of
a controller or processor. It can order a controller or processor to change
their processes, comply with data subject requests. The Data Protection
Commission can also issue warnings to controllers and processors and can ban
processing as well as commence legal proceedings against a controller or
processor.

Organisations that are engaged in cross-border processing of personal data can
choose to deal with a single lead supervisory authority, a [ one stop shop
(OSS) ](https://www.dataprotection.ie/en/organisations/international-
transfers/one-stop-shop-oss) for most of their processing activities.
