###  Data protection definitions

Under the GDPR, _personal data_ is data that relates to or can identify an
individual either by itself or together with other available information.
Personal data can include your name, address, contact details, an
identification number, IP address, CCTV footage, access cards/co-tags, audio-
visual or audio recordings of a person and location data.

A _data subject_ is the individual to whom the personal data relates. You can
read about the rights of data subjects in our document [ Accessing your
personal data under GDPR ](/en/government-in-ireland/data-protection/rights-
under-general-data-protection-regulation/) .

Doing anything with your personal data, including storing it, is known as
_processing_ .

The organisation or business who decides what to do with your data is known as
a _controller_ . However, that entity can allow another person or entity to
process your personal data on its behalf. The person who processes the
information on behalf of the data controller is known as a _processor_ .

This document outlines the obligations of data controllers and processors
under the GDPR.
