###  The obligation to keep records

Under the GDPR, any controller that has more than 250 employees, or that
processes sensitive information, must keep a record of the processing
activities under its responsibility.

That record should consist of:

  * The name and contact details of the controller 
  * The purposes of the processing 
  * A description of the categories of data subjects and personal data 
  * Categories of recipients of the data 
  * Any transfers of data to third countries and that country's data safeguards 
  * Time limits for erasure of data 
  * A description of the data security measures in place 

Processors must keep similar records. These records can be inspected by the
Data Protection Commission on request.
