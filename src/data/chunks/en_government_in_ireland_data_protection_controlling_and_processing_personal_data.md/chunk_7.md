###  The obligation to use processors that meet the requirements of the
legislation

Where processing is to be carried out by a processor and not the controller,
the controller must use only those processors who guarantee that their systems
of processing meet the requirements of the Regulation.

Examples of processors of his nature include payroll companies, accountants
and market research companies, all of which could hold or process personal
information on behalf of someone else. **Cloud providers** are also generally
data processors.

The controller must have a contract with the processor setting out the scope
of the processing required by the controller and the processorâ€™s obligations
under the Regulation. A processor cannot outsource this processing to another
processor without the controller's consent and a similar contract agreed with
that second processor.

Processors should follow any relevant code of conduct that may be prepared by
the Data Protection Commission. Processors may also receive certification
demonstrating their compliance with the Regulation.
