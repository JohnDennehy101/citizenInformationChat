###  The obligation to lawfully process personal data

Organisations can only use or keep personal data where there is a lawful
reason. The GDPR sets out the six standard lawful reasons which can be used by
an organisation:

  * You have given your free and informed consent. 
  * The processing is necessary to carry out a contract which you are a party to, such as the delivery of a product 
  * The processing is necessary for the controller to comply with a legal obligation, such as the mandatory collection of details for anti-money laundering or tax purposes 
  * The processing is necessary to protect your vital interests or the vital interest of another person, such as accessing medical records in an emergency 
  * The processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or where the controller has official authority, such as public security processing 
  * The processing is necessary in the legitimate interests of the processing organisation if it doesnâ€™t conflict with your rights, such as to prevent fraud 

You must be given enough information in simple and clear language to know what
an organisation is going to do with your personal data. This is often found in
privacy policies on websites or in forms which you can read or sign in person.
