###  The obligation to report data breaches

Under the GDPR, a controller must notify the Data Protection Commission of a
personal data breach without delay where that breach is a likely to result in
a risk to the rights and freedoms of the data subject. Notification should be
made. at the latest, within 72 hours of the controller becoming aware of the
breach. Data processors must notify the respective controllers if the
processor becomes aware of a breach. The controller should then notify the
data subject without delay.

A controller must also notify a data subject without delay in clear and plain
language if the data breach is likely to result in a high risk to the rights
and freedoms of the data subject. An example of a high risk situation would be
where your bank details are stolen.
