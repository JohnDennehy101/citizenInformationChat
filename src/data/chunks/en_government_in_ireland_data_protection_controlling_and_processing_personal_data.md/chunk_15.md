####  Transferring data to the UK

Before the end of the transition period, any personal information received by
any company or organisation in the UK from companies and administrations in
other member states was covered by the GDPR.

Transfers of personal data to the UK continue to be permitted on the basis of
a formal decision (called an adequacy decision) made by the European
Commission on 28 June 2021. That adequacy decision will remain in place for
four years unless the UK makes changes to its data protection legislation.
