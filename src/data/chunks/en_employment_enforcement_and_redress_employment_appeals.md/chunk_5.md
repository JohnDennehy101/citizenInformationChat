###  What happens at the hearing?

Labour Court hearings on appeals are in public unless the Labour Court decides
that they should be in private (or partly in private) because of special
circumstances.

The Labour Court has wide powers to require witnesses to attend and to take
evidence on oath.

The Labour Court can refer a question of law arising in the appeal to the [
High Court ](/en/justice/courts-system/high-court/) . The High Courtâ€™s
decision is final and conclusive.
