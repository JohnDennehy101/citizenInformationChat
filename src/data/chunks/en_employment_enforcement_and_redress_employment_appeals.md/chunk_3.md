##  Making an appeal

Your case must first be heard by a WRC adjudicator. You can appeal the
adjudicator's decision to the Labour Court.

The time limit for making an appeal is 42 days after the date of the WRC
decision.

This time limit can be extended if the Labour Court is satisfied that there
were exceptional circumstances causing the delay.

The Labour Court can decide to deal with a complaint or dispute by written
submissions only. Either party can object to this but must object within 42
days of being told.
