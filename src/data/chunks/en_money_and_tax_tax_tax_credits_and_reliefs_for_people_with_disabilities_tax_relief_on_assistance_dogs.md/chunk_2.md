##  What is an assistance dog?

Assistance dogs are specially trained dogs that help people with disabilities
carry out practical tasks.

Assistance dogs are trained to meet the needs of their owner. For example,
assistance dogs may:

  * Alert a deaf owner to sounds 
  * Help with dressing and undressing 
  * Help with standing and walking 
  * Bring things to their owner or pick up dropped items 
  * Warn an owner of danger or of certain symptoms so that the owner can take appropriate action 
  * Bark to get help in an emergency
