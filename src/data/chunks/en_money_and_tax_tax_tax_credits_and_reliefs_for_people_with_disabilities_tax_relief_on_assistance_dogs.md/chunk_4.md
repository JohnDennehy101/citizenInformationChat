##  How to apply

To get the tax relief, you must have a letter from the supplier of your dog,
confirming that you have a trained dog. You give the letter to Revenue the
first time you claim the relief. You can then continue to get the tax relief
in the following years while you have the dog. If you no longer have an
assistance dog, let Revenue know.

You can upload the letter and claim the relief online through the Manage My
Record section in [ myAccount ](https://www.ros.ie/myaccount-web/sign_in.html)
.

You can also claim the relief by completing a paper [ Form 12 (pdf)
](https://www.revenue.ie/en/self-assessment-and-self-
employment/documents/form12.pdf) , or [ Form 12S (pdf)
](https://www.revenue.ie/en/self-assessment-and-self-
employment/documents/form-12s.pdf) (a simplified version for routine tax
returns) and returning the form to your Revenue office with the letter from
your supplier.

You can request a paper Form 12 or a Form 12S by phoning the [ Revenue Forms
Ordering Service ](https://www.revenue.ie/en/online-services/services/tools-
and-calculators/order-forms.aspx) at (01) 738 3675 or by email at [
custform@revenue.ie ](mailto:custform@revenue.ie) . Include the following
details with your request:

  * The title of the form and year 
  * Your name 
  * Your Personal Public Service (PPS) number
