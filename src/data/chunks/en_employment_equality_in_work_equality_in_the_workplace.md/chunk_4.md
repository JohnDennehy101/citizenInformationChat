##  What counts as discrimination in the workplace?

Discrimination is defined as less favourable treatment. An employee is said to
be discriminated against if they are treated less favourably than another
employee is treated, has been treated or would be treated, in a comparable
situation on any of the above 9 grounds.

Discrimination can be _direct_ or _indirect_ .

To establish **direct discrimination** , a direct comparison must be made. For
example, in the case of disability discrimination the comparison must be
between a person who has a disability and another person who has not. Or,
between two people with different disabilities.

**Indirect discrimination** is when practices or policies do not appear to
discriminate against one group more than another, but actually have a
discriminatory impact.

Indirect discrimination can also happen where a requirement that may appear
non-discriminatory adversely affects a particular group or class of people.
