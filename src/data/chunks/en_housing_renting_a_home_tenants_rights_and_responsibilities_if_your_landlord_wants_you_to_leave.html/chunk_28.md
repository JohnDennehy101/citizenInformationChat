###  What is illegal eviction?

An illegal eviction (or unlawful termination) is when your landlord stops you
accessing your rented property or removes your belongings whether or not a
valid notice of termination has been served.

If your landlord locks you out or physically evicts you, you may be able to
apply for an injunction to force them to let you back into the property, or
you may apply to the RTB to do so on your behalf.

If your landlord cuts off water, gas or electricity, you may be able to take
legal action to restore the supply. In either case, you should get legal
advice before you proceed. Your landlord cannot remove your possessions from
your home while your tenancy is still in existence (though after a tenancy has
ended, a landlord is under no legal obligation to store or look after your
belongings).

If your landlord is going to refer a dispute to the RTB, you should get advice
about your situation from [ Threshold ](https://www.threshold.ie/) or a
solicitor.

The [ Free Legal Advice Centre (FLAC) ](/en/justice/legal-aid-and-advice/free-
legal-advice-centre/) is an organisation that offers free basic legal advice.
You can get basic legal information from the FLAC phone line on (01) 906 1010.

FLAC also provide a small number of free legal advice phone appointments with
volunteer lawyers. These appointments are limited and only available if you
are referred. You can be referred for a FLAC phone advice appointment by a [
Citizens Information Centre (CIC) ](https://centres.citizensinformation.ie/) .
