####  Rent arrears

If you haven’t paid your rent, your landlord must send you a written rent
arrears warning notice before they can issue a notice of termination. The rent
arrears warning notice must state the amount of rent you owe and give you 28
days to pay it. The landlord must send a copy of the rent arrears warning
notice to the RTB. The 28 days you have to pay the rent arrears counts from
the date you and the RTB receive the warning notice. If the landlord does not
send the warning notice to you and the RTB, a notice of termination will not
be valid.

If you do not pay the rent arrears in the 28 days, your landlord can then give
you 28 days’ notice of termination. The landlord must send the notice of
termination to the RTB on the same day it is sent to you. If this is not done
the notice of termination will be invalid.

This process for ending a tenancy because of rent arrears is set out in [
Section 12 of the Residential Tenancies and Valuation Act 2020
