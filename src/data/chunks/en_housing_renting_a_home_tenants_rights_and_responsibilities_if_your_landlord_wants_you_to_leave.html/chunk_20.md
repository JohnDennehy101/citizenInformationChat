###  If you have a complaint about the reason your landlord gives for ending
your tenancy

You can complain to the RTB if your landlord ends a tenancy because they are
selling the property, changing its use, substantially refurbishing it, or
because they need it for themselves or an immediate family member and:

  * The property becomes available for re-letting and they do not offer you a tenancy 
  * They did not carry out the intention stated in the notice of termination 

If the RTB upholds your complaint, it may direct the landlord to pay you
damages or to reinstate your tenancy, or both.
