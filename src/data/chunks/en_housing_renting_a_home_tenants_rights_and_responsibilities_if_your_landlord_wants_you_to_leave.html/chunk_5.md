##  What is a valid reason for ending a tenancy after the first 6 months?

Generally, your landlord can only end a tenancy after the first 6 months if:

  * You do not comply with the [ obligations of the tenancy ](/en/housing/renting-a-home/tenants-rights-and-responsibilities/tenants-rights-and-obligations/) , for example, by not paying your rent on time 
  * The property is no longer suited to your needs, for example, if it is too small 
  * The landlord intends to sell the property within 9 months. However, this may not apply if the landlord plans to sell 10 or more dwellings in a development within a 6-month period – see ‘Restriction on terminating when selling multiple properties’ below 
  * The landlord needs the property for their own use or for an immediate family member (this only applies to private landlords) 
  * The landlord plans to change the use of the property (for example, convert it from residential use to office use) 
  * The landlord intends to refurbish the property substantially
