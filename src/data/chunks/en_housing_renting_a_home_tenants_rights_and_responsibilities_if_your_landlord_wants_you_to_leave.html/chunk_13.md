###  What is a valid notice of termination?

[ The law
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2004/act/27/enacted/en/print#sec62) sets
out the requirements for a valid notice of termination. It must:

  * Be in writing (an email is not sufficient) 
  * Be signed by the landlord (or an authorised agent) 
  * Specify the date of termination of the tenancy 
  * State that you have the whole 24 hours of the termination date to vacate the property 
  * Specify the date of the notice itself 
  * State the reason for termination, if a tenancy has lasted more than 6 months or is a fixed-term tenancy. (This does not have to be included for tenancies in student-specific accommodation.) 
  * State that any issue about the validity of the notice or the right of the landlord to serve it must be referred to the RTB within 90 days from the receipt of the notice. (This 90-day timeframe applies unless the tenant is in breach of their obligations.) 

Your landlord must give additional details in certain situations and, in some
cases, a statutory declaration. The information below describes the additional
details needed for each of the valid reasons for terminating your tenancy. The
RTB also provides [ sample notices of termination ](https://www.rtb.ie/ending-
a-tenancy/sample-notices-of-termination) , with the details required in each
situation.
