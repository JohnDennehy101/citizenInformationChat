with the costs of repairing or getting a new hearing aid under the [ Treatment
Benefit Scheme. ](/en/social-welfare/disability-and-illness/treatment-benefit-
scheme/)

You may also be able to claim tax relief on hearing aids.

If you have private health insurance, check with your insurance company
whether your policy covers hearing aid costs.
