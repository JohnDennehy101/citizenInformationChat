###  Meeting the PRSI conditions for payments

If you return to Ireland following your volunteer development work, and apply
for a social welfare payment, the time you spent abroad as a volunteer
development worker can be used to satisfy the PRSI requirements for the
payment **as if you had been working in Ireland** during that time. This
applies to:

  * [ Adoptive Benefit ](/en/social-welfare/families-and-children/adoptive-benefit/)
  * [ Carer’s Benefit ](/en/social-welfare/carers/carers-benefit/)
  * [ Health and Safety Benefit ](/en/social-welfare/families-and-children/health-safety-benefit/)
  * [ Illness Benefit ](/en/social-welfare/disability-and-illness/illness-benefit/)
  * [ Jobseeker's Benefit ](/en/social-welfare/unemployed-people/jobseekers-benefit/)
  * [ Maternity Benefit ](/en/social-welfare/families-and-children/maternity-benefit/)
  * [ Parent’s Benefit ](/en/social-welfare/families-and-children/parents-benefit/)
  * [ Paternity Benefit ](/en/social-welfare/families-and-children/paternity-benefit/)
  * [ Treatment Benefit Scheme ](/en/social-welfare/disability-and-illness/treatment-benefit-scheme/) (optical, aural and dental benefits) 

**Other qualifying conditions**

The VDW scheme also makes it easier to qualify for payments, by removing some
of the conditions you normally need to meet.

**Illness Benefit, Jobseeker’s Benefit and Health and Safety Benefit**

You get the full rate of payment, regardless of how much you earned in the
relevant tax year. This means that for claims made in the year of your return,
and in the 2 years following your return, you get the full rate of payment.
You must satisfy all the other rules to qualify.

**Carer’s Benefit**

Volunteer development workers do not have to have contributions paid in the
relevant tax year, or to have been in employment for 8 weeks in the previous
26 weeks before starting their Carer’s Benefit. You must take up Carer’s
Benefit immediately at the end of your volunteer development work to qualify.

**Paternity Benefit, Maternity Benefit, Adoptive Benefit and Parent’s
Benefit**

You can qualify for these payments in the year you return to Ireland from the
developing country or the year after you return.

You must have 39 weeks of contributions paid or credited since the start of
your working life.

**Treatment Benefit**

You can apply for Treatment Benefit the year you return, or the following
year, if you have 26 weeks of paid contributions since the start of your
working life, and you have 26 weeks paid or credited contributions in the
relevant tax year.
