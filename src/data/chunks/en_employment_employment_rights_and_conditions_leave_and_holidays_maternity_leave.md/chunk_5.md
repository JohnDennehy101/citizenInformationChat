###  Can I take time off for medical visits?

While you are pregnant, you can take time off for medical visits connected
with the pregnancy. You can take as much time off as you need for these
visits, including the time for travelling to and from the appointment and for
the appointment itself.

You must give your employer a note from your doctor to confirm the pregnancy,
and give 2 weeksâ€™ notice of your medical visits. You should show your
appointment card if your employer asks to see it at any time after your first
appointment.

You can also take time off for medical visits, for up to 14 weeks after the
birth. You have the right to be paid while keeping these medical appointments,
both before and after the birth.
