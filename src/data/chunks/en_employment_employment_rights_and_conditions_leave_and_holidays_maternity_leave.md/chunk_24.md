###  **How much notice must I give my employer?**

You must give your employer at least 4 weeks' written notice that you plan to
take maternity leave and must provide a medical certificate confirming your
pregnancy.

You must also give at least 4 weeks’ written notice if you want to take the 16
weeks’ additional maternity leave. You can give both these notices at the same
time.
