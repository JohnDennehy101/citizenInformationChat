###  **What happens if I get sick while on postponed maternity leave?**

If go back to work after postponing your maternity leave and then need time
off because you become ill, then either:

  * Your employer may consider you to have gone back on maternity leave on the first day you are off sick, or 
  * You can choose to give up your right to take the rest of your maternity leave, so that you are treated as being on [ sick leave ](/en/employment/employment-rights-and-conditions/leave-and-holidays/sick-leave-and-sick-pay/) .
