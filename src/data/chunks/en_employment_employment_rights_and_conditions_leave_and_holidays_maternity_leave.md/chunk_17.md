###  **Premature births**

If your baby is born before the date when you are due to start maternity
leave, you can take extra maternity leave. You get 26 weeks’ leave, starting
from the day your baby is born, plus extra leave for the number of weeks
between your baby’s actual date of birth and the date you had planned to start
your maternity leave. Maternity Benefit is payable for the whole of this
extended maternity leave.

**Example – Your baby is born in week 30**

Trish planned to start her maternity leave and Maternity Benefit at week 37 of
her pregnancy, which was 2 weeks before the end of the week when her baby was
due.

However, her baby was born in week 30 of her pregnancy – 7 weeks before she
planned to go on maternity leave and start getting Maternity Benefit. She got
maternity leave for the basic 26 weeks from the date of birth and an extra 7
weeks at the end of those 26 weeks. So Trish’s basic maternity leave and
Maternity Benefit lasted until her baby was about 33 weeks old.
