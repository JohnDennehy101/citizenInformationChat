###  When can I take health and safety leave?

Your employer should carry out separate risk assessments when you are
pregnant, have recently given birth or are breastfeeding. They should either
remove any risks or move you away from them. If these options are not
possible, they should give you health and safety leave from work. If you are
pregnant, health and safety leave may continue until you go on maternity
leave.

During health and safety leave, you get your normal wages for the first 3
weeks. After this, you may get [ Health and Safety Benefit ](/en/social-
welfare/families-and-children/health-safety-benefit/) from the DSP, depending
on your PRSI contributions. The Health and Safety Authority website has a list
of [ Pregnant at Work FAQs
](http://www.hsa.ie/eng/Workplace_Health/Sensitive_Risk_Groups/Pregnant_at_Work_Frequently_Asked_Questions/)
