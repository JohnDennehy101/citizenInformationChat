###  **Can I take additional maternity leave?**

You can take additional maternity leave for up to 16 more weeks, beginning
immediately after the end of your 26 weeksâ€™ basic maternity leave. Maternity
Benefit does not cover additional maternity leave, and your employer does not
have to pay you during this time.
