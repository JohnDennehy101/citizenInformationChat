##  Introduction

As an employee, you have the right to take 26 weeks’ maternity leave if you
become pregnant. You also have the right to take up to 16 weeks’ additional
maternity leave.

You can take this time off work from full-time, casual or part-time
employment. It does not matter how long you have been working for your
employer.

You must take at least 2 weeks’ maternity leave before your baby is due, and
at least 4 weeks after the baby is born.

If you have enough social insurance (PRSI) contributions, you are entitled to
Maternity Benefit (including self-employed) for the 26 weeks’ of basic
maternity leave. Maternity Benefit does not cover additional maternity leave.

The legislation laws covering this leave are the [ Maternity Protection Acts
1994 and 2004
