###  **Stillbirths and miscarriages**

If you have a [ stillbirth or miscarriage ](/en/birth-family-
relationships/miscarriage-and-stillbirth/) at any time after the 24th week of
pregnancy or your baby has a birth weight of at least 500 grammes, you are
entitled to full maternity leave. This means you can take the basic 26 weeks’
maternity leave and 16 weeks’ additional maternity leave. If you have enough
PRSI contributions, you can get Maternity Benefit for the 26 weeks’ basic
maternity leave.

To apply for Maternity Benefit following a stillbirth or miscarriage, you need
to send a letter from your doctor with the Maternity Benefit application form.
The letter must state the expected date of birth, the actual date of birth and
the number of weeks of pregnancy.
