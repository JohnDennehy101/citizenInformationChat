##  Who can get a Personal Reader Grant under Work and Access?

If you have a visual impairment or are blind and need help with reading at
work, you may be eligible to apply. Only an employee or self-employed person
can apply.

To get a Personal Reader support you must first [ meet the general eligibility
requirements for Work and Access. ](/en/employment/employment-and-
disability/work-and-access-programme/)

You must be able to give evidence confirming your condition, unless you have
been getting a long-term disability payment.

You may need a Workplace Needs Assessment if you need a reader for work. If
you need a reader during a recruitment process, you wonâ€™t need a Workplace
Needs Assessment.

Work and Access is only available to private sector, community and voluntary
sector and not-for-profit organisations. Public sector employers should cover
the costs of any necessary adaptations or support for public sector workers.

If you are a student at college or university and are having difficulty with
reading because of a visual impairment, you should get in touch with the
Disability Liaison Officer for your college or university.
