##  Introduction

Budget 2012 was announced on 5 December and 6 December 2011. **This document
will be updated throughout the week as details become available.**

The main Budget changes which may affect people living in Ireland are set out
below.

This document sets out changes in the areas of taxation, social welfare,
health, housing, education, employment and other areas. It is an overview and
not a complete statement of the measures announced in Budget 2012.

Some of the changes announced in the Budget come into effect immediately.
Others take effect from the beginning of January 2012. Many others have to be
finalised before coming into effect. Some elements of these measures may
change when the Finance Bill is published â€“ this is expected in early 2012.
