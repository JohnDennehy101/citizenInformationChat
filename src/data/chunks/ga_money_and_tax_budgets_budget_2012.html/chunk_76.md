####  Labour market activation

â‚¬20 million has been allocated for a new Labour Market Activation Fund which
will be specifically targeted at the long-term unemployed and will deliver
over 6,500 training education and training places in 2012.

The Government will shortly publish a policy statement, _Pathways to Work_ ,
which will set out its strategy to reform labour market activation policy to
prevent the drift into, and help the reduction of, long-term unemployment.
