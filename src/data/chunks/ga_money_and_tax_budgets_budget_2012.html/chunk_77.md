####  Administrative efficiencies/rationalisation

The Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation’s Comprehensive Review of
Expenditure led to the following key outcomes:

  * Implementation of changes to business process aimed at delivering services more efficiently 
  * The streamlining of the State’s employment rights bodies (i.e. the Labour Relations Commission, the National Employment Rights Authority, the Employment Appeals Tribunal, the Equality Tribunal and the Labour Court) will create a single entry point for all users of the employment rights machinery 
  * Greater utilisation of eGovernment tools in the Companies Registration Office 
  * A strong commitment to the public service reform agenda, in particular in the areas of shared services and outsourcing models in appropriate cases, including high-volume case processing operations
