####  Other measures for schools

Capitation grants to schools are reduced by 2%. The primary rate will be €183
and the second-level rate will be €317. The enhanced grant for schools in the
DEIS (Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools) programme is not
changing.

Supports will be withdrawn on a phased basis from some schools that are in
educational disadvantage schemes which pre-date the DEIS programme.

The Modern Languages in Primary Schools Initiative is being abolished.

Almost €10 million is provided to start implementation of actions in the
Literacy and Numeracy Strategy, work on Junior Cycle reform and phased rollout
of high-speed broadband to second-level schools.

Changes will be announced to the operation of the school book grant in order
to incentivise the establishment of book rental schemes in schools. (early
2012)
