####  One-Parent Family Payment

The upper age limit of the youngest child for new claimants will be reduced to
12 years in 2012. (It is currently 14 years for new claimants.) It will be
reduced further to 7 years on a phased basis in following years.

The means test for OFP is being amended:

  * The amount of earnings disregarded in the One-Parent Family Payment means test will be reduced from €146.50 to €130.00 per week in 2012 for new and existing recipients. Half the weekly earnings in excess of this amount will also be disregarded. (January 2012) 
  * Further reductions will be introduced over the following 4 years: to €110 in 2013, €90 in 2014, €75 in 2015 and €60 in 2016. 
  * The temporary payment of half the One-Parent Family Payment rate where the recipient's earnings exceed €425 per week will be discontinued. Existing recipients of the temporary payment will not be affected. (January 2012) 

People getting One-Parent Family Payment can get half-rate Jobseeker’s
Benefit, Illness Benefit or Incapacity Supplement if they satisfy the
qualifying conditions. These half-rate payments will cease for applicants for
Jobseeker’s Benefit, Illness Benefit and Incapacity Supplement. (January 2012)
