####  Pupil/teacher ratio

The pupil/teacher ratio for fee-paying post-primary schools will increase from
20:1 to 21:1 (2012/2013)

Staffing for all 199 DEIS Band 1 primary schools will be based on a general
average of 1 teacher for every 22 pupils. This will replace the present
arrangement of giving a 'top up' allocation on the existing standard staffing
schedule in order to implement reduced class sizes.

All 195 DEIS second-level schools will have a reduced pupil/teacher ratio of
18.25:1. (A pupil/teacher ratio of 19:1 applies in non-fee-paying second-level
schools.)

Staff numbers in primary schools with 4 teachers or fewer will be adjusted on
a phased basis from 2012/2013.

Post-primary schools will have to manage guidance provision from within their
existing pupil/teacher ratio allocations.
