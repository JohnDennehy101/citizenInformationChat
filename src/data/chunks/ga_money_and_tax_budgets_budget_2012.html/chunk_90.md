The threshold for the Drugs Payment Scheme will increase from €120 to €132 per
month from January 2012.

There will be no change for medical card holders - the 50 cent per item charge
on drugs remains.

People who claim free drugs under the Long Term Illness Scheme will now have
free GP care.

€35 million will be invested in community mental health teams and services, as
recommended in _A Vision for Change_ . The timescale is given as “in the
medium term”.

There will be a further increase in the charges for private beds in public
hospitals.

Legislation will be introduced to abolish the existing system where hospital
beds are designated as private or public and to allow hospitals to raise
charges in respect of all private patients.

Greater efficiencies such as a shift from inpatient to day care and a more
rigorous allocation of home help hours have been signalled.

Additional funding of €55 million is to be made available for the Nursing
Homes Support Scheme (“Fair Deal”) in 2012.
