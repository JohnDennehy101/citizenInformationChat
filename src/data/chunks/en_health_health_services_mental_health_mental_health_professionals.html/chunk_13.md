###  Behavioural therapist

Behavioural therapy is based on the idea you can change what people do by
teaching them to respond to things in a different way.

Behavioural therapy helps you control undesirable habits or irrational fears
(phobias) and can be used in treating behavioural conditions such as eating
disorders.

In many cases, behaviours can be learned or unlearned through basic
conditioning techniques including:

  * Aversive conditioning - unwanted habits are paired with unpleasant stimuli 
  * Systematic desensitisation - a stimulus that causes anxiety is paired with a pleasant one. 

Some behavioural therapists may also be psychiatrists, psychologists,
psychiatric nurses or social workers who have been trained to work in this
area. While this therapy is often used to treat behaviour disorders, it may
not be available in all regions.
