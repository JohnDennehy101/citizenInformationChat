##  Counsellor

There are different forms of counselling for a wide range of problems and many
counsellors specialise in areas such as [ addiction ](/en/health/health-
services/alcohol-and-drug-treatment-services/alcohol-addiction-services/) or [
bereavement ](/en/death/bereavement-counselling-and-support/) .

Counsellors do not judge you but attentively listen and respect you as the
client. Counselling aims to help you take control of your own life. You can
usually self-refer to counselling, although a GP, psychiatrist or trusted
friend may be able to recommend someone suitable.

Some counsellors are qualified psychologists, but many are not. Those who are
not may have a basic degree or training in other areas and/or relevant work
experience (for example, teaching or nursing) plus a counselling
qualification. These qualifications can vary from Master's degrees to short-
term courses.

It is important to make sure you are happy with the training and
qualifications of any counsellor that you choose. Counselling is often one
session per week and can continue for a specific number of sessions or last
longer, although this can vary.
