###  Psychiatrist

A psychiatrist is a medical doctor that specialises in mental health.
Psychiatrists are responsible for the medical care of psychiatric patients and
can help you with your mental health using medication and counselling.

A psychiatrist usually works in a psychiatric hospital or unit or as part of a
community care team but can also be part of a private practice.

In most cases, your GP will refer you to a psychiatrist if they think it is
necessary or if you ask for a referral.

A psychiatrist will assess you to decide on the best treatment. This may
involve treatment with medication or referral to a member of the mental health
team. If a psychiatrist thinks it necessary, they may suggest that you be
admitted to hospital.
