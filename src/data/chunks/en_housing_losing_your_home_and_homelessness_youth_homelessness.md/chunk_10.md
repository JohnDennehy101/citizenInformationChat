###  **If you’re under 18**

If you are under 18 and homeless, or you know someone who is, you should
contact [ Tusla ](https://www.tusla.ie/get-in-touch/) for help and to get
accommodation.

If it is outside standard working hours, you should contact the [ Gardaí
](https://www.garda.ie/en/contact-us/station-directory/) and they will contact
the on-duty Tusla social worker for you, so they can find you emergency
accommodation. This is the process the Gardaí follow if they find you sleeping
on the streets.

Tusla will assess your needs and make a care plan for you. This may mean:

  * Going home 
  * Going to stay with relatives 
  * Foster care 
  * Going to [ alternative accommodation ](https://www.tusla.ie/services/alternative-care/)
