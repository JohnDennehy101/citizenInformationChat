####  **Financial supports after you leave care**

You can also get financial supports as part of the Tusla aftercare service.
The [ Aftercare Grant ](https://www.tusla.ie/services/alternative-care/after-
care/tell-me-more-about-the-aftercare-grant/) can help with the cost of a
deposit and getting set-up in your own place. While, the [ Aftercare Allowance
](https://www.tusla.ie/services/alternative-care/after-care/tell-me-more-
about-financial-support-while-attending-accredited-training-educatio/) is a
weekly payment to help with your costs if you are in training or education.

If you were in Tusla care before you turned 18 and you qualify for [
Jobseekerâ€™s Allowance ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-
welfare/unemployed-people/jobseekers-allowance/) when you are 18, you may get
the [ full rate of the payment ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-
welfare/unemployed-people/jobseekers-allowance/#28a767) instead of the reduced
rates that apply to most young people.
