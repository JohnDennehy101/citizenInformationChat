##  What is youth homelessness?

Youth homelessness describes 13 to 26 year-olds who are living without a
parent or guardian and donâ€™t have stable accommodation.

For example, they may be:

  * Sleeping rough on the streets, or somewhere else that is not meant for night-time accommodation, such as a park, vacant building, shop or bus shelter 
  * Living in temporary accommodation intended for short stays, such as a hostel, shelter or bed and breakfast 
  * Staying temporarily with friends or relatives who can only accommodate them for a short time. This is often known as couch surfing.
