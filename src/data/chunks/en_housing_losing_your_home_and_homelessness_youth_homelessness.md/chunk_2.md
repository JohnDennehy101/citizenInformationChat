##  Where to go if you are homeless

If you are under 18 and homeless, or if you know a young person who is
homeless, contact [ Tusla ](http://www.tusla.ie/get-in-touch/local-area-
offices/) or the [ Garda Síochána ](http://www.garda.ie/Stations/Default.aspx)
. They can provide support.

If you are 18 or older, you should contact your [ local authority
](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/942f74-local-authorities/) to get
emergency accommodation.

You can also contact one of the [ organisations working specifically with
homeless people ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/housing/losing-your-
home-and-homelessness/agencies-for-homeless-people/) and with homeless young
people.
