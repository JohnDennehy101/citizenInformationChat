##  Government response to youth homelessness

In June 2021, Ireland signed the [ European Platform on Combatting
Homelessness
](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_21_3044) . This
committed Ireland to work towards ending homelessness by 2030.

This commitment to end homelessness by 2030 is repeated in the Government’s [
housing plan ](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/ef5ec-housing-for-all-a-new-
housing-plan-for-ireland/) to 2030. This plan aims to address homelessness by
using a housing-led approach, which includes:

  * Expanding [ Housing First ](https://www.housingagency.ie/housing-information/housing-first) . Housing First gives rough sleepers and people who have been homeless for a long-time their own secure accommodation and intensive health supports. 
  * Building more one-bedroom homes 
  * Providing health and mental supports for people who are homeless 
  * Developing more emergency accommodation 
  * Expanding street outreach services 
  * Developing a Youth Homelessness Strategy 

**Youth Homeless Strategy**

The most recent [ Youth Homelessness Strategy
](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/69597-youth-homelessness-strategy/) was
launched in 2022. It has 27 actions aimed at:

  * Preventing young people becoming homeless 
  * Improving young people’s experience in emergency accommodation 
  * Assisting young people to exit homelessness
