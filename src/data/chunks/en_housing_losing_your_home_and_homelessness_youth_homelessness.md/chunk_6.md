###  **If you are homeless and under 18**

If you are under 18, you are considered a minor. This means your parents, or a
guardian are legally responsible for you.

But, if youâ€™ve left home, or it is not safe for you to be there, then [ Tusla
](https://www.tusla.ie/) is legally responsible for your care and welfare.

They will work to find alternative accommodation for you with a guardian, or [
in care ](/en/birth-family-relationships/services-and-supports-for-
children/children-and-the-care-system/) , such as [ foster care
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/birth-family-relationships/adoption-
and-fostering/fostering/) or [ residential care
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/birth-family-relationships/services-
and-supports-for-children/children-in-care/) .

This is set out in the [ Child Care Act 1991
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1991/en/act/pub/0017/index.html) .
