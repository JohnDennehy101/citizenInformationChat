###  **If you are homeless and 18 or older**

Young people who are 18 and older are not covered by this legislation. This
means no organisation is legally responsible for providing homeless services
to young people aged 18 or older.

However, you can access general homeless services and accommodation in the
same way as adults who are homeless.

Local authorities have a general responsibility to provide housing for adults
who cannot afford it. So, you can contact your [ local authority
](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/942f74-local-authorities/) to access
emergency accommodation.
