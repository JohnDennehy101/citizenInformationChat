###  Solvent estate

A solvent estate is one where there are enough assets to pay the debts and the
funeral and testamentary expenses.

Where there are more assets than liabilities, your estate is solvent. However,
if your assets are not sufficient to fulfil all of the wishes in your will,
after paying the debts and expenses, your estate is solvent but not
sufficient.

If your estate is solvent, your funeral and other expenses and your debts must
be paid first. If you die [ intestate ](/en/death/before-a-death/making-a-
will/) (without making a will), the rest of your estate is then divided
according to the rules on intestacy.

If you have made a will but there will not be enough left after paying all of
the debts and expenses to give the full gift to everyone, then there is a set
order to which parts of the estate debts are paid from first:

  1. Property which you did not deal with in the will (that is, property which would be distributed in accordance with the rules on intestacy) 
  2. The residue - this is the amount left over when specific gifts are dealt with 
  3. Property specifically devoted for the payment of debts 
  4. Property charged with the payment of debts 
  5. Pecuniary legacies - these are gifts of money as distinct from property or goods 
  6. Other gifts 

When making your will, you can specify a different order for the payment of
your debts.
