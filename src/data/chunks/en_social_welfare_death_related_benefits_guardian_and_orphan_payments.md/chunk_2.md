##  Introduction

If you are taking care of an orphan, you may get a social welfare payment. It
is not necessary to be a legally appointed guardian. You may get such a
payment if the orphan lives with you and you are responsible for his or her
care. The payment must benefit the orphan.

If an orphan is attending a full-time education course, is aged between 18 and
22 years of age and is not living with or in the care of a guardian, the
payment can be paid directly to the orphan.

The payment can be contributory (based on PRSI payments paid by the parent) or
non-contributory (based on a means-test).

You can claim only one of the following:

  * Guardian's Payment (Contributory) previously called Orphan's (Contributory) Allowance 
  * Guardian's Payment (Non-Contributory) previously called Orphan's (Non-Contributory) Pension 
  * Death Benefit/Orphan's Pension awarded under the Occupational Injuries Scheme. 

You cannot get one of these payments and a [ Foster Care Allowance
