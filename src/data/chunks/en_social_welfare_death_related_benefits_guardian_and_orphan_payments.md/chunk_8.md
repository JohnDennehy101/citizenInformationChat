##  Rates

In 2024, the Guardian's Payment (Contributory) is paid at a standard rate of
€215 per week and the maximum Guardian's Payment (Non-Contributory) is €215
per week.

Whether or not you get the maximum Guardian's Payment (Non-Contributory) will
depend on the [ means test ](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-
system/means-test-for-social-welfare-payments/means-test/) (this is carried
out on the orphan's means - if any). If the orphan has means from work the
first €7.60 is not assessed. If the orphan’s weekly means are more than €7.60
the Guardian's Payment (Non-Contributory) is reduced by €2.50 for each €2.50
assessed (that is, for each €2.50 or part of €2.50 of means over the amount of
€7.60). See [ SW19 for a table of how an orphan’s means affect a Guardian’s
Payment (Non-Contributory).
