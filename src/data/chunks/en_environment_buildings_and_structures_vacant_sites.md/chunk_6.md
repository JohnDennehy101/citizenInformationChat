##  How much is the vacant site levy?

Since 2019, the levy is 7% of the market value of the land. Previously it was
3%.

If you own a site on the vacant site register you may have to pay the vacant
sites levy. The levy is intended to encourage the development of vacant sites
and to reduce land hoarding.

The vacant sites levy is paid to the local authority each year until the site
is removed from the register. The levy is paid in arrears each year, this
means that the levy for 2021 was charged in January 2022.
