##  What is a vacant site?

A vacant site is either:

  * **Residential land** (more than 0.05 hectares) where there is a need for housing in the area. The site is suitable for housing and the majority of the site has not been in use for an extended period of time. 
  * **Regeneration land** (other than residential land) where the majority of the site has not been in use for an extended period of time, or the site is having a negative impact on existing amenities or on the character of the area.
