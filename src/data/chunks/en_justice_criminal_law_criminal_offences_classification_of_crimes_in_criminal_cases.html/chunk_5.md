##  Minor and non-minor offences

Under Article 38.2 of the [ Constitution of Ireland ](/en/government-in-
ireland/irish-constitution-1/constitution-introduction/) minor offences can be
tried in courts of summary jurisdiction, that is, the District Court. The
Constitution does not define what a minor offence is, although minor offences
are often set down by the actual law. Minor and non-minor offences equate more
or less with the statutory distinction drawn between summary and indictable
offences.

The Supreme Court has however considered the issue of what constitutes a minor
offence. The most important case in this area is a case called _Melling v Ã“
Mathghamhna [1962] IR 1_ . In examining the criteria or rules when deciding
whether an offence was minor the Supreme Court laid out the following test:

  * The severity or seriousness of the punishment 
  * Moral guilt of the accused 
  * The law in 1937 when the Constitution was adopted, and 
  * Public opinion 

Of these four tests, the most important one is the severity or seriousness of
the sentence.

All that can be said with certainty is that an offence is minor where the
punishment is less than six months imprisonment ( _Conroy v Attorney General
[1965] IR 411_ ), whereas an offence is non-minor where the punishment is two
years or more ( _Mallon v Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry [1996] 1
IR 517_ ). It appears, however, that the courts have come to the belief that
an offence with a maximum prison sentence of twelve months constitutes a minor
offence. It can be said as a result that any offence that carries a penalty of
more than twelve months imprisonment is considered a non-minor offence.
