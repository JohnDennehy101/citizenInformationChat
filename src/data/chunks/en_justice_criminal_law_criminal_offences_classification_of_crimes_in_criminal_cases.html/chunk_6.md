##  Serious and non-serious offences

The [ Bail Act 1997
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1997/en/act/pub/0016/index.html) created a
new distinction between serious and non-serious offences. It states that bail
can be refused where an accused is charged with a serious offence and it can
be established that they are likely to commit further serious offences if
released on bail. The Bail Act 1997 defines a serious offence as an offence
that you could be punished by imprisonment for 5 years or more, if you are
convicted.
