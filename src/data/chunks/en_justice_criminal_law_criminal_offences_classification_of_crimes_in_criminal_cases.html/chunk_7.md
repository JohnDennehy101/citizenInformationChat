##  Arrestable and non-arrestable offences

The [ Criminal Law Act 1997
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1997/en/act/pub/0014/index.html) defines an
arrestable offence as an offence that you could be punished by imprisonment
for 5 years or more, similar to the definition of a serious offence mentioned
above.

This distinction holds great importance for the Gardaí. [ Section 4 of the
Criminal Law Act 1997
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1997/en/act/pub/0014/sec0004.html#zza14y1997s4)
allows a Garda to arrest anyone that they have reasonable cause to believe is
guilty of committing an arrestable offence. They can do this without a
warrant.

Anyone arrested for an arrestable offence without a warrant can be detained in
a Garda station for up to 24 hours for questioning, before being charged or
released. In certain circumstances if you remain silent when questioned by
Gardaí, assumptions can be drawn from your silence in any proceedings against
you for an arrestable offence. [ Further information on your right to silence
is available here ](/en/justice/arrests/right-to-silence-in-criminal-cases/) .
