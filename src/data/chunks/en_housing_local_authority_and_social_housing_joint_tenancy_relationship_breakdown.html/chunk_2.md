##  What is a joint tenancy in a local authority home?

A joint tenancy is usually created when a local authority or approved housing
body (AHB) allocates a home to a couple. This means that you and your partner
both sign the tenancy agreement with the local authority or AHB. The local
authority can also create a joint tenancy where the tenants arenâ€™t partners,
in certain circumstances.
