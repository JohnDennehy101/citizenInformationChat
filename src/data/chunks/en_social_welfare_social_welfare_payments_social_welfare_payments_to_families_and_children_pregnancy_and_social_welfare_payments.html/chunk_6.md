##  Pregnancy and One-Parent Family Payment

If you are pregnant and getting a One-Parent Family Payment, you will continue
to get the payment as long as you satisfy the conditions. When your baby is
born you will qualify for an increase in your payment for a child dependant.
If you are pregnant and do **not** have other children, you are **not**
entitled to One-Parent Family Payment until your baby is born.

You may get half-rate Maternity Benefit with your One-Parent Family Payment if
you meet the conditons for both payments. If you are not entitled to a One-
Parent Family Payment, and you have no other income you may get some financial
support under the [ Supplementary Welfare Allowance Scheme ](/en/social-
welfare/supplementary-welfare-schemes/supplementary-welfare-allowance-scheme/)
.
