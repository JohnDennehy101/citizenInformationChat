###  Minimum education

[ Section 14
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2000/en/act/pub/0022/sec0014.html#partiii-
sec14) of the [ Education (Welfare) Act 2000
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2000/en/act/pub/0022/index.html) provides for
parents to educate their children in places other than recognised schools,
such as in the home or in private schools. You do not need to follow a
national curriculum. However, the Act states that parents must ensure their
child receives _a certain minimum education._

A _recognised school_ is a school overseen by the Department of Education. An
independent school (or non-recognised school) is a school that is not overseen
by the Department of Education.

There are detailed [ Guidelines on the Assessment of Education in places other
than recognised schools (pdf)
](https://www.tusla.ie/uploads/content/guidelines_assessment_education_outside_schools.pdf)
. The guidelines provide a working definition of _a certain minimum education_
. They describe home-based education and how it is assessed.

The education should:

  * Be suited to your child's age, ability, aptitude and personality 
  * Be responsive to your child’s individual needs and take account of the areas of learning that interest your child 
  * Ensure that your child's personal potential is enhanced and not suppressed 
  * Address the immediate and future needs of your child in the context of the cultural, economic and social environment 
  * Provide a reasonably balanced range of learning experiences, so that no one aspect of your child’s learning is emphasised to the exclusion of others 
  * Develop your child's personal and social skills and prepare them to be a responsible citizen 
  * Contribute to your child's moral development 
  * Provide opportunities for your child to develop their intellectual capacities and understanding 

The basic skills that are part of a minimum education include development and
progression in oral language, literacy and numeracy. A child would be at a
serious disadvantage if their home education programme did not develop these
basic skills.
