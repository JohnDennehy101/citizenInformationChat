###  Third-level education

If your child does not sit State examinations, then entry to third-level
education in Ireland is difficult. The normal route into Irish third-level
institutions is through the Leaving Certificate.

However, it may also be possible to enter third-level education at aged 17 or
18 without the Leaving Certificate by interview only. You will need to
approach your chosen institution to discuss this possibility. There are a
variety of courses for the 16-plus age group which are accepted as valid for
entry to third-level courses.

You can find out more about further and higher education and training courses
from [ Qualifax - The National Learner's Database ](http://www.qualifax.ie/) .
