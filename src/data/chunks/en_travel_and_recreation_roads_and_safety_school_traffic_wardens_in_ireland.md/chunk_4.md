##  Rules

School traffic wardens can only stop vehicles on a public road if they are
wearing the appropriate uniform and exhibiting the proper sign.

[ Under Section 96 of the Road Traffic Act 1961, (as amended)
](https://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1961/act/24/section/96/enacted/en/html#sec96)
, you are guilty of an offence if you fail to stop a vehicle or animal (or to
remain stopped) when a school traffic warden holds up their stop sign. This
offence carries an initial €160 fine and 2 penalty points. If you do not pay
the fine within 28 days, the fine increases first to €240. If you do not pay
the fine and are summoned to court, you could be fined even more and get 5
penalty points.

Before starting their job, each school traffic warden must undergo a
comprehensive training programme organised by their local authority about road
safety and their duties.
