###  Education

If your child is having difficulties in school, you should speak to their
teacher or school principal. They will advise you on what to do next. This may
include an [ educational assessment ](/en/education/primary-and-post-primary-
education/educational-supports/psychological-assessment-school/) . Formal
educational assessment of school-going children is generally carried out by
the [ National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS)
](https://www.gov.ie/en/service/5ef45c-neps/) . You can arrange a private
assessment if NEPS psychologists are not available. Some parents choose
private assessments. If your school arranges an assessment through NEPS, there
is no charge for the assessment.
