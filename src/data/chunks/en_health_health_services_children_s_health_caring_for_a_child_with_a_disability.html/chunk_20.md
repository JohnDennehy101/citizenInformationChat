##  Adapting your home

You may qualify for the [ Housing Adaptation Grant for people with a
disability ](/en/housing/housing-grants-and-schemes/housing-supports-for-
older-people-and-people-with-disabilities/housing-adaptation-grant-for-people-
with-disability/) if you need to adapt your home to make it more suitable for
a child with a disability.

Adaptations might include:

  * Adding an extra room 
  * Making the house wheelchair accessible 
  * Putting in a ground-floor bathroom and toilet. 

An occupational therapist's assessment may be required. If you only require
minor work, you can apply for the [ Mobility Aids Grant Scheme
](/en/housing/housing-grants-and-schemes/housing-supports-for-older-people-
and-people-with-disabilities/mobility-aids-grant-scheme/) instead.
