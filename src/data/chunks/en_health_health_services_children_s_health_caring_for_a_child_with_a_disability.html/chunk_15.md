###  When your child reaches 16

When your child reaches the age of 16, they may qualify for [ Disability

If your child is getting Disability Allowance, but is not capable of managing
money, the Department of Social Protection may [ appoint you as an agent
](/en/health/legal-matters-and-health/legal-arrangements-for-incapacity/) to
collect your childâ€™s payment and act on their behalf. The money belongs to
your child and you must use it for their benefit. If your child has
substantial money or assets, they may be made a [ Ward of Court
