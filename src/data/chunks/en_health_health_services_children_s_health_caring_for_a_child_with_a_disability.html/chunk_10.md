###  Early-years

Pre-school children with disabilities can generally attend mainstream pre-
schools. All children are entitled to two yearâ€™s free pre-school education and
early childhood care under the [ Early Childhood Care and Education Scheme
](/en/education/pre-school-education-and-childcare/early-childhood-care-and-
education-scheme/) . Some specialised pre-school services may be available in
your area and many pre-schools have staff who are trained to work with
children with special needs.

Children with a disability are entitled to an [ Assessment of Need
](/en/health/health-services/health-services-for-people-with-
disabilities/assessment-of-need-for-people-with-disabilites/) of education
supports and services (see above).
