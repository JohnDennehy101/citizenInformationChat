##  If you are worried about your child's development

Your GP does free [ developmental examinations ](/en/health/health-
services/reproductive_health/maternity-and-infant-welfare-services/) in the
weeks following your babyâ€™s birth. Your [ public health nurse ](/en/birth-
family-relationships/after-your-baby-is-born/maternity-care-and-public-health-
nurse/) also monitors the development of your baby in their early weeks,
months and years and provides information and support to parents.

Some children develop more slowly than other children. If [ you think that
your child is not developing as they should
](https://www2.hse.ie/services/disability-support-and-services/if-you-are-
worried-your-child-might-have-a-disability.html) , make an appointment with
your GP or public health nurse as soon as possible.

Often there is nothing to be worried about, and many children catch up in
their own time. If the GP or public health nurse is concerned, they can refer
you to the service your child needs.
