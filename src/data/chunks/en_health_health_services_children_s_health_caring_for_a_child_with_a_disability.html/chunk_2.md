##  Introduction

Disability can be diagnosed at any stage during a childâ€™s development. A child
may be found to have a disability before birth or around the time of birth.
Sometimes a disability may not become apparent until later in your child's
life when they have difficulty learning in school. In some cases children
acquire a disability after an illness or accident.

When your child is diagnosed with a disability, it can be an emotional time.
The HSE has [ advice for parents and guardians
](https://www2.hse.ie/services/disability-support-and-services/if-you-have-
just-found-out-your-child-has-a-disability/if-you-have-just-found-out-your-
child-has-a-disability.html) who get this news.

You and your child are entitled to the same services and benefits as all other
families living in Ireland.

This page outlines services, supports and payments for children living with a
disability. They apply whether your child was born with a disability or
acquired it later.

The Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth has
also published a [ directory of services and supports available for children
with additional needs. ](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/65c97-supports-for-
parents-with-children-with-additional-needs/)

If your child is 18 or over, the [ Guide to entitlements for people with
disabilities 2022 (pdf)
](https://www.citizensinformationboard.ie/downloads/guides/guide_to_entitlements_for_people_with_disabilities_2022.pdf)
has detailed information for adults with disabilities and their carers.
