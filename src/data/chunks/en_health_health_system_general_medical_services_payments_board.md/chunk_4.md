##  How do healthcare providers get paid for their services?

When doctors, pharmacists, dentists and opticians provide healthcare services
for the Health Service Executive (HSE), the HSE uses the PCRS to pay them. How
much they are paid, and other conditions of service are negotiated by the
Department of Health and the relevant professional bodies.
