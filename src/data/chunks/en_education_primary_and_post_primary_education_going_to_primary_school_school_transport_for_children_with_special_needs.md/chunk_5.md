###  Special class arrangements

Transport services for children with special needs are only provided for the
period of enrolment in a special class. If the child returns to mainstream
classes, special transport arrangements will not be provided.

Eligible children who are enrolled in an autism class/unit attached to a
mainstream school and who subsequently mainstream in that school will retain
their transport eligibility for the duration of their primary education in
this school. However, a new application must be made if they transfer to a new
school.
