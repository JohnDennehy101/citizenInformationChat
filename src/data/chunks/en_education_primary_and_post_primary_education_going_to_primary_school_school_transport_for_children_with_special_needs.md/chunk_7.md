You should apply to the school principal who will contact the school’s [
Special Educational Needs Organiser (SENO) ](https://ncse.ie/special-
educational-needs-organiser-seno) about applying for special transport. If the
SENO is satisfied that your child is enrolled in the nearest suitable school,
and that school transport is required, a recommendation will be sent to the
School Transport Section of the Department of Education.
