####  **Payments that cannot be claimed with WFP**

You cannot get WFP, if you are on one of these schemes or social welfare
payments:

  * [ Community Employment Scheme ](/en/employment/unemployment-and-redundancy/employment-support-schemes/community-employment-scheme/) , [ Rural Social Scheme ](/en/social-welfare/farming-and-fishing/rural-social-scheme/) , or [ the TÃºs scheme ](/en/employment/unemployment-and-redundancy/employment-support-schemes/tus/) . 
  * [ Jobseeker's Benefit ](/en/social-welfare/unemployed-people/jobseekers-benefit/) , [ Jobseeker's Allowance ](/en/social-welfare/unemployed-people/jobseekers-allowance/) , [ Jobseeker's Transitional payment ](/en/social-welfare/unemployed-people/jobseekers-transitional-payment/) or [ Farm Assist ](/en/social-welfare/farming-and-fishing/farm-assist/)
  * [ Part-Time Job Incentive Scheme ](/en/social-welfare/social-welfare-payments-and-work/part-time-job-incentive-scheme/) . 

Your spouse, civil partner or cohabitant can claim WFP while you are getting
one of these payments. However, an Increase for a Qualified Adult (IQA) will
no longer be paid and your social welfare payment will be assessed as income
for their WFP. Any Increase for a Qualified Child (IQC) will be affected.

Similarly, if your spouse, civil partner or cohabitant is getting one of these
payments, you can qualify for WFP, but they will no longer be paid an IQA for
you.
