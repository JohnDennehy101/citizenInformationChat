##  Rules for getting the Working Family Payment

You can get a weekly tax-free WFP payment if you are an employee and:

  * Work 38 or more hours per fortnight (in any combination of hours). You can combine your weekly hours with your spouse, civil partner or cohabitant's hours to meet this condition. You **cannot** use time spent in self-employment (or on Community Employment, Tús, JobBridge or the Rural Social Scheme) to meet this condition. 
  * Your job is likely to last at least 3 months 
  * You have at least one child who normally lives with you 
  * You earn less than the WFP income limit set for your family size 

You must pay tax and PRSI in Ireland. Under EU regulations, you may be able to
claim WFP if your children are living abroad and are dependent on you.

WFP is paid for one year (52 weeks), as long as you meet the conditions. It
does not change if your earnings from work go up or down during that year.
After 52 weeks, you can apply again for WFP. Some changes to your situation
can affect your WFP – see below.
