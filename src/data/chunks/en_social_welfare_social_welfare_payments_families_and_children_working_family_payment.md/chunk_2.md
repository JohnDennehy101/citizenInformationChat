##  What is the Working Family Payment?

Working Family Payment (WFP) is a weekly tax-free payment for employees with
children. It supports people who are on low pay. WFP used to be called Family
Income Supplement (FIS).

You must be an employee to get WFP. You cannot get it if you are self-employed
only.

You must have at least one child who normally lives with you or who you
support financially. Your child must be under 18 (or between 18 and 22 if they
are in full-time day education).

To get WFP, your average weekly family income must be under a certain amount
for your family size. The WFP payment you get is 60% of the difference between
your average weekly family income and the WFP income limit for your family
size. For more information, see ‘Rate of Working Family Payment’ below.

WFP is not taken into account in the means test for a [ medical card
