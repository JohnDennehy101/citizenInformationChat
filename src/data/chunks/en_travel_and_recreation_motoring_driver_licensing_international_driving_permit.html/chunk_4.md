##  Who can apply

It is available to Irish residents, who have a current full Irish driving
licence and to all EU/EEA licence holders who are resident in Ireland.

You cannot get an international driving permit in Ireland if:

  * You have not passed your driving test and have a learner permit 
  * Your driving licence is due to expire within 6 months 

You should always carry your own driving permit (even if you have an
international driving permit) when travelling abroad. You may need to produce
this licence for inspection, for example, when hiring a car abroad.

Each international driving permit is valid for one year from the date of
issue.
