##  How long will it take to get my International Driving Permit?

If you use the express service (€15), you will get your application within 7
working days, and it is returned to you by normal post.

If you use the standard service (€10), you will get your application within 10
working days.

If you are applying from outside of Ireland, allow an extra 5 working days.
This is in case of international postage delays.
