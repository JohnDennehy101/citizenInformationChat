####  Key Employee Engagement Programme (KEEP)

An incentive is being introduced to facilitate the use of share-based
remuneration by small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to attract key
employees. Gains arising to employees on the exercise of KEEP share options
will be liable to Capital Gains Tax on disposal of the shares, in place of the
current liability to income tax, Universal Social Charge (USC) and Pay Related
Social Insurance (PRSI) on exercise. This incentive will be available for
qualifying share options granted between 1 January 2018 and 31 December 2023\.
