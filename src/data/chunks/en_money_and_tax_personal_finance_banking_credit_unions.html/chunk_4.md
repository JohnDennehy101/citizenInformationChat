####  Dividends

Your credit union may declare a dividend at the end of each year. As credit
unions are not-for-profit, any income generated is returned to members in the
form of a dividend, or may be used to improve and enhance services. The return
on savings will vary from credit union to credit union, depending on the
surplus income available at the end of the year.
