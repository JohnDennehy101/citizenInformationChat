##  Nominating a beneficiary if you die

You can make a written statement nominating someone to get your property in
the credit union when you die, for example, your savings or insurance.

The property will not then be part of your estate for the purposes of your
will or intestacy. This means the nominated person can access the funds
without waiting for the legal processes to be completed.

The maximum amount that may be nominated is â‚¬27,000.

A completed nomination must be signed and witnessed. You can change your
nomination at any time.
