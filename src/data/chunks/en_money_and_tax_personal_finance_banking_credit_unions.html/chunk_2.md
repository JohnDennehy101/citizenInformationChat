##  Introduction

Credit unions are financial co-operatives where members can save and lend to
each other at fair rates of interest. They are non-profit organisations that
have a volunteer ethos and community focus.

You can become a member of a credit union if you have a common bond with other
members. The most usual common bonds are:

  * **Community bond:** members live or work in the same area 
  * **Occupational bond:** members are in the same profession or work for the same employer 
  * **Associational bond:** members are in the same society or association 

Each credit union is owned by its members, who each have one vote. The
membership elects individual members to the board of directors of the credit
union.

There are two main umbrella bodies for credit unions - the [ Irish League of
Credit Unions (ILCU) ](https://www.creditunion.ie/) and the [ Credit Union
Development Association (CUDA) ](https://www.cuda.ie/) . Most credit unions
belong to one of these bodies. These bodies may have other rules their members
must follow and they provide other services to credit unions.
