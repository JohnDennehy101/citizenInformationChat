####  Complaint handling

You should first contact your health insurer with your health insurance query
or complaint using the insurerâ€™s internal complaints procedure.

The HIA can investigate a query or complaint about health insurance. If you
want to escalate your complaint, the HIA will tell you the options available
for further action, for example referral to the Financial Services and
Pensions Ombudsman or the Courts.
