####  Complaint handling

The FSPO is a statutory body that acts as an independent mediator helping
consumers resolve complaints with pension providers and regulated financial
services providers.

If a complaint is not resolved, the FSPO can investigate the matter further.
It can make a decision that is legally binding on the financial institution
(subject to appeal to the High Court), including ordering the provider to pay
compensation.

The FSPO has the power to publish legally binding decisions in relation to
complaints about financial service providers.
