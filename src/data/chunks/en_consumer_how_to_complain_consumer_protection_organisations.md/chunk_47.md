####  Regulation and enforcement

The NTA is the national enforcement body for EU passenger rights in rail,
maritime and coach transport.

It regulates public bus services (both private and State-owned), the small
public service vehicle (SPSV) sector (for example, taxis or hackneys), and
vehicle clamping operations.

It also operates a dispute resolution service for electronic toll service
providers.
