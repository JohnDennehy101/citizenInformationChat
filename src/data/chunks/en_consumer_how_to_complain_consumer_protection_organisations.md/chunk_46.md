####  Complaint handling

The National Transport Authority operates a national complaints and
enforcement system for public transport.

The NTA will only investigate written complaints.

To assist you with queries and complaints about public transport services, the
NTA has developed [ transportforireland.ie

[ Passenger rights complaint form
](https://www.transportforireland.ie/ga/tacaiocht/an-bhfuil-ceist-
