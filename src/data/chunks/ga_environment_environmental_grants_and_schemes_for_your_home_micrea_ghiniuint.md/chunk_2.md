##  Cad is micrea-ghiniúint ann?

Micro-generation is the small-scale generation of electricity from renewable
sources by households and small businesses.

You can do this by installing a small generator powered by a renewable source.
Some examples of sources of micro-generation include:

  * Painéil ghréine 
  * Micrea-gaoithe 
  * Micrea-hidrea 
  * Teas agus cumhacht in-athnuaite micrea-inathnuaite (CHP) 

This electricity you generate from these renewable sources can be stored in a
battery and used, or it can be sold to the grid through your electricity
provider.
