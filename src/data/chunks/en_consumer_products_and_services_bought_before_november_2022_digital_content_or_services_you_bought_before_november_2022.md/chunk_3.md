often downloaded or streamed over the [ internet ](/en/consumer/phone-
internet-tv-and-postal-services/internet-contracts/) . Examples of digital
content include:

  * Games and software 
  * Films and TV programmes 
  * Ebooks 
  * Music 
  * Mobile and tablet applications 
  * Online news platforms 

Some digital content may be free to use, for example, mobile applications or
‘apps’. For others, you may have to pay a one-off fee or a regular
subscription.

Whether the digital content is free or paid-for, it will usually require you
to share some personal information with the trader supplying it. This can
include your name, email address and possibly payment details. Websites and
apps should tell you what personal information they collect and how it will be
used. You can read more about your [ data protection rights.
