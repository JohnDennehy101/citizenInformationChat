##  Your consumer rights

If the digital content is in a _tangible_ format, you have the same consumer
rights as when buying other goods, for example a pair of shoes or a toaster.

Examples of tangible digital content are:

  * A film that is on a DVD or CD 
  * Software that’s pre-loaded onto a device such as a phone or tablet 
  * Software that is embedded in a product you buy such as smart appliances (like a smart fridge). 

If the products you receive are not of satisfactory quality, fit for purpose
or do not match the description you were given, you have a right to certain
remedies. A remedy could be a repair, replacement or a refund.

For _intangible_ digital content (content that is downloaded or streamed),
more general consumer and contract law applies and your rights are not as
strong under consumer legislation when the product is faulty (for example, the
downloaded music doesn’t play on your device). From 1 November 2022, there are
new rules which give you a right to a refund, repair, replacement or price
reduction for [ digital content or service that is not as described or faulty
](/en/consumer/buying-digital-content-and-services/problem-with-digital-
content-or-service/) .

For digital content purchased before 1 November 2022, you do still have some
protections under general consumer and contract law.
