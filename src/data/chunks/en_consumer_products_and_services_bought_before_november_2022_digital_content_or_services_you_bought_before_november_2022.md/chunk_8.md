##  How to complain

When you enter into a digital content contract, both you and the seller are
bound by the terms and conditions. This means that you have to pay but the
seller also has to provide what was promised.

If you have a problem, put your complaint in writing to the service provider
as soon as you can to see if they can fix it.

If you cannot resolve the problem, you can:

  * Contact the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC) for information and advice 
  * Contact your bank or credit card provider to use chargeback. The CCPC has more information on [ chargeback ](https://www.ccpc.ie/consumers/money/credit-cards/disputed-card-transactions-chargeback/)
  * Take a claim against the seller using the [ Small Claims Procedure ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/justice/courts_system/small_claims_court.en.html)
