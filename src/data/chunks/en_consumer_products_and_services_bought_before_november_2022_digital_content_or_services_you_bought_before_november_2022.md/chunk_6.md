##  Using your online content subscriptions abroad

You have the right to have full access to your online content subscriptions
such as Netflix or Spotify when travelling temporarily in the European Union
(EU) under the [ Regulation on cross-border portability of online content
services ](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-
content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32017R1128&from=EN) .

The Regulation (known as the ‘portability regulation’) became law across the
EU in April 2018. It applies to online content you have subscribed to and paid
for in Ireland. The rules also apply to content that is free if the service
provider chooses to be covered by the portability rules. The European
Commission has an [ infographic on portability and travelling with your online
content across the EU. ](https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-
