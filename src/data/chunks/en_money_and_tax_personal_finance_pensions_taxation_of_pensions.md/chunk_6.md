####  PAYE

If you have income from employment or an occupational pension, you are taxed
under the PAYE system.

If you are a PAYE taxpayer, your tax credits and tax rate band are reduced to
take account of the tax that is due on your social welfare pension. This means
that the amount of tax due on your social welfare pension is deducted from
your other income.

The technical term for this is _coding in_ of credits. If your social welfare
pension is not coded in, you have to pay tax as a self-employed person in a
lump sum by 31 October each year.

**Self-employed**

If you are self-employed, you include your social welfare payments on [ your
income tax return ](/en/money-and-tax/tax/income-tax/taxation-of-self-
employed-people/) (Form 11) and pay any tax due with your annual income tax
payment.
