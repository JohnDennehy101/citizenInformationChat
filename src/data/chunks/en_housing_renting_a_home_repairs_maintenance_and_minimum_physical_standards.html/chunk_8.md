##  Inspections and enforcement

Local authorities are responsible for enforcing these minimum standards in
rented accommodation.

If you are renting accommodation under the [ Housing Assistance Payment (HAP)
](/en/housing/renting-a-home/help-with-renting/housing-assistance-payment/)
scheme, the local authority will inspect your accommodation within the first 8
months of your tenancy unless the accommodation has already been inspected in
the last 12 months. Local authorities also carry out [ planned programmes of
inspection of rented properties ](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/da3fe-
private-housing-market-statistics/#private-rented-inspections) .

If you think that your home does not meet these minimum standards, you should
tell your landlord first. This applies, whether you are renting from a private
landlord, a local authority or an approved housing body.

If you think your accommodation is sub-standard or your landlord refuses to
carry out repairs that are needed, you can ask your local authority to make
your landlord comply with the standards. See 'Useful contacts' below.

If your landlord fails to meet the minimum standards, they can be penalised
and prosecuted. Local authorities can issue Improvement Notices and
Prohibition Notices to landlords who do not comply with the minimum standards
regulations.

An Improvement Notice outlines what the landlord must do to fix the breach of
regulations. If the landlord does not do these works, the local authority can
issue a Prohibition Notice. This notice tells the landlord not to re-let the
property until they fix the breach in regulations.
