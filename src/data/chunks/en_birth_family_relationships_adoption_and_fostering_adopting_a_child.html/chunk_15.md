###  You and the child attend the adoption hearing

When the adoption order is finally being made, the child and adoptive parents
go before the Board of the Adoption Authority of Ireland. The adoptive parents
must give sworn evidence about their identity and eligibility.

The adoptive parents will have previously completed a form indicating the name
the child wants on the adoption order. While this can be changed at the
adoption hearing, it is preferable for this to be agreed on before the date of
the hearing.

Read more about the adoption hearing on the Adoption Authority of Ireland's
website, including [ age-appropriate videos and leaflets for children
](https://aai.gov.ie/en/information-for-young-people.html) .
