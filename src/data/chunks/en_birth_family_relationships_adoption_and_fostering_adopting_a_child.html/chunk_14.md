###  An adoption order is made

An _adoption order_ is a legal document, issued by the Adoption Authority of
Ireland. It confirms that the child is, by law, a member of their new family.
When an adoption order is issued, the child is legally regarded as the child
of the adoptive parents, as if they were born to them.

The period of time between the granting of the declaration of eligibility and
suitability to the making of an adoption order differs from one case to
another depending on the type of adoption application being made and the
particular circumstances of the applicants and the child.

In the case of a step-parent adoption where the child is in situ, it is
expected that the application for the adoption order will progress during the
lifespan of the declaration of eligibility and suitability.

Where it is a domestic infant adoption, there is no guarantee that a couple
will be matched with a child during the lifetime of the declaration. Before
making an adoption order the Adoption Authority of Ireland must be satisfied
that the child is eligible to be adopted.
