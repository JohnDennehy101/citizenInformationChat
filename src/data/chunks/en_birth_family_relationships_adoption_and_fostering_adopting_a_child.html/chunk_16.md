###  You get an adoption certificate

At the adoption hearing, you are given information about getting a new birth
certificate for the child. The new birth certificate (adoption certificate) is
normally available through the General Register Office **within 4 weeks** .

Although it is not an actual birth certificate, it has the same status as one,
and it replaces the birth certificate for legal purposes. The adoption
certificate gives the date of the adoption order and the names and addresses
of the adoptive parents. It is similar in all aspects to a birth certificate.
