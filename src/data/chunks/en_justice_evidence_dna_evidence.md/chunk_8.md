##  DNA samples

DNA samples are divided into database samples and evidential samples. A
database sample is taken so it can be added to the DNA database and an
evidential sample is taken to investigate a crime, but in most cases it is
also added to the database.

Database samples are taken from a sample of hair (other than pubic hair) or
from a swab of the personâ€™s mouth. Evidential samples can be intimate or non-
intimate samples. Intimate samples include blood, pubic hair and urine, while
non-intimate samples can be saliva, hair or nails. When you are asked to give
a DNA sample you must be informed if it will be added to the DNA database.

A database sample can be taken from someone who is arrested and detained for a
relevant offence (an offence that has a maximum sentence of 5 years or more,
see [ Section 9 of the 2014 Act
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2014/act/11/section/9/enacted/en/html#sec9)
). In these cases the database sample can be taken without your consent, and
reasonable force can be used to get the sample. You must be told a number of
things before the sample is taken, including that your DNA profile will be
added to the DNA database.

In some cases a volunteer will be asked to give a DNA sample. Volunteers may
be someone else involved in a case, for example, the victim. DNA samples can
only be taken from volunteers to investigate specific offences. The volunteer
must get extensive information about the process and must give their consent
to have the sample added to the DNA database.
