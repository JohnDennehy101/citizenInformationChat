##  The DNA database

Under the [ Criminal Justice (Forensic Evidence and DNA Database System) Act
2014 ](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2014/act/11/enacted/en/html) a DNA
database was established in Ireland. This database is used:

  * As an intelligence source for criminal investigations 
  * To help find missing people 
  * To help identify unknown people 

The Act states that certain DNA samples can be taken to be added to the DNA
database. [ Forensic Science Ireland ](https://forensicscience.ie/) manage the
DNA database. The database has an investigation section and an identification
section. The investigation section is used to investigate suspected crimes and
the identification section is used to help identify unknown and missing
people.

The investigation section has a number of indexes including:

  * A reference index: which contains the DNA profiles of people who gave DNA samples under the 2014 Act, and people who gave samples under the repealed [ Criminal Justice (Forensic Evidence) Act 1990 ](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1990/act/34/enacted/en/html)
  * A crime scene index: which contains samples taken from crime scenes 
  * 3 elimination indexes: which are used to eliminate certain people’s DNA from an investigation. One elimination index has DNA samples from staff of Forensic Science Ireland, another has samples from Gardaí, and the last has samples from prescribed persons. Prescribed persons are other people who may have contaminated DNA samples in the course of their work.
