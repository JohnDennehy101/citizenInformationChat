##  Introduction

DNA stands for _deoxyribunucleic acid_ . DNA is the blueprint for your genetic
makeup. It consists of a pattern of bands, a bit like a barcode. The way that
DNA bands are arranged is unique to each person. There are some common
features between the DNA patterns of parents, their children and other
relatives.
