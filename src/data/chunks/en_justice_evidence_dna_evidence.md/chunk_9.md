###  Exemptions and protections for certain people

Database samples cannot be taken from certain people. These people are called
protected persons and include:

  * People who don’t have the capacity to understand the DNA testing process and cannot give consent 
  * Children under the age of 14 

Protected persons do not have to give database samples, but must give
evidential samples, if required. When a protected person gives an evidential
sample, information about the process must be explained to them in an
understandable way. If the protected person’s guardian refuses to give consent
for the sample to be taken, the Gardaí can apply to the District Court to get
the sample. A responsible adult should be present if reasonable force needs to
be used to take a sample from a protected person. The Gardaí cannot use
reasonable force to get the sample from a child under 12 years old.
