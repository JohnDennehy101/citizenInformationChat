##  Introduction

If you are a farmer, there are a number of grants and schemes available to
you. For example, there are payments to subsidise your income and grants to
help modernise your farm and make it more sustainable.

Most schemes have their own qualifying criteria and application process.
However, you can apply for some of the schemes when [ applying for BISS
](/en/environment/land/basic-income-support-for-sustainability-scheme-for-
farmers/) , which is the main income subsidy for farmers.

Some of the schemes may be closed to new applicants, but it is important that
you know the terms and conditions of any scheme you are claiming to make sure
you are following the scheme rules.

Most schemes for farmers in Ireland come from the Common Agricultural Policy
(CAP) for all EU countries.

However, there are some separate schemes and grants that are helpful for
farmers, including certain schemes that encourage farmers develop forests.
