##  Introduction

The Food Safety Authority of Ireland (FSAI) is an independent statutory
organisation. It was established by the Food Safety Authority of Ireland Act,
1998.

The FSAI protects consumers by ensuring that standards for food safety and
hygiene are met when food is consumed, produced, distributed or marketed in
Ireland. It works with other official agencies, including the Health Service
Executive (HSE), to enforce food safety legislation in Ireland.

This page explains what the FSAI does, how food safety laws are enforced, and
how to make a complaint about a food premises.
