  * Managing risks in the food chain and responding to any national or international food incidents 
  * Ensuring the safety of the food chain by detecting, deterring and preventing breaches of food law 
  * Researching food safety through coordinated studies and scientific collaboration 

The FSAI can also seek reports from any state body on matters affecting food
safety. It reports to the Minister for Health.
