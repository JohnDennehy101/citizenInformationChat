##  What can I comment on?

Your comments must be based on planning considerations, not on personal likes,
dislikes or grievances. Planning considerations include:

  * National and regional guidelines and ministerial directives 
  * Policies and objectives of the development plan 
  * Policies and objectives of any local plan 
  * Local considerations such as site development density, parking provision, traffic hazards, overlooking, effects on residential amenity 
  * Public health 
  * Environmental, amenity and shopping impacts 
  * Other material planning matters 

Any comments or observations you make on a planning application are public.

If you make allegations against a person or organisation in your comments,
this could be seen as defamatory and you could be sued.
