##  How can I comment on a planning application?

You must make comments about planning applications in writing to the local
authority where the application was made. You may be able to do this on your
local authority's website.

If possible, you should quote the planning application's reference number. You
must also give your:

  * Name 
  * Address 
  * Phone number 
  * Email address (if you have one)
