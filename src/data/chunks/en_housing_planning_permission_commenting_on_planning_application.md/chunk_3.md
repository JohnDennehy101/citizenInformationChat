##  Where can I find planning applications?

People who are applying for planning permission must put up a site notice and
advertise in a local newspaper that circulates in the area.

Local authorities must prepare weekly lists of planning applications and make
them available for inspection in their offices and public libraries for at
least 8 weeks.

You can also view planning applications on your [ local authority's website
](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/942f74-local-authorities/) .

You can see all the documents submitted with a planning application. These are
kept at the offices of your local authority.
