###  What happens when your comments are received?

Your submission or observation must be acknowledged by the local authority.

The local authority cannot make a decision on an application until they have
had it for 5 weeks. This is so people have time to view and comment on the
application.

When the local authority decides on the planning application, you must be
informed of their decision within 3 days of them making it.

If your submission is received after the deadline, it will be returned to you
along with your fee. You will also be contacted by your local authority to
tell you that your submission can't be considered. The deadline for commenting
on a planning application is 5 weeks from when the local authority received
the planning application.
