###  Hospital charges

As part of the Maternity and Infant Care Scheme, you are entitled to free in-
patient, out-patient and emergency care in public hospitals in relation to the
pregnancy and birth. You do not have to pay [ hospital charges
](/en/health/health-services/gp-and-hospital-services/hospital-charges/) .

However, if you need hospital care for other illnesses which are not related
to your pregnancy, this is not covered by the Scheme.

If you choose to be a private patient of your consultant, you will be liable
for the full range of in-patient charges. Read about the [ differences between
public, semi-private and private maternity services ](/en/birth-family-
relationships/before-your-baby-is-born/choices-in-antenatal-care/) .
