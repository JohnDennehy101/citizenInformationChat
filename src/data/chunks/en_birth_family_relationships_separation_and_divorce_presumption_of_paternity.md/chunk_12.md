##  Inheritance

Children of parents who are not married to each other may also have to prove
paternity in order to get their maintenance or inheritance entitlements.

This is not necessary if the father acknowledges paternity or is named as the
child's father on the birth certificate. If he acknowledges paternity, he can
agree to have his name added to the birth certificate.
