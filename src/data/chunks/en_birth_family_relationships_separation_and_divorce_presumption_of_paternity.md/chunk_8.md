##  Paternity testing

Paternity testing is carried out usually using swabs from the mouth, but can
also use blood and hair.

To get a paternity test, you can:

  * Contact a laboratory yourself (they will ask you to choose a GP to do the tests) 
  * Go to a specialist agency that will organise the test for you 

If results are needed for court, you must confirm that the tests are done to a
court approved standard and are accredited.

If the results are for ‘peace of mind’, the procedure is less expensive.
However, you must confirm with the testing service that it uses an accredited
laboratory.

You cannot use the test results to have the father's name placed on the birth
certificate without his consent.
