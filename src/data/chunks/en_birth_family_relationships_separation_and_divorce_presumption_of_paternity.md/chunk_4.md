###  When parents are not married

There is also a presumption of paternity if parents are not married to each
other, but the father’s name is on the child’s birth certificate.

However, it can be different if the parents are not married to each other and
the father’s name is not on the birth certificate.

Fathers who are not married to the mother of their children and are not named
on the birth certificate may need to prove paternity for several reasons.
These include to apply for:

  * Guardianship 
  * Custody 
  * Access to their children 

A parent may need to prove the father is the father of their child or children
so they can apply to the court for a [ maintenance ](/en/birth-family-
relationships/separation-and-divorce/maintenance-orders-and-agreements/)
order. Whether married or not, there is a legal responsibility on both parents
to maintain dependent children.
