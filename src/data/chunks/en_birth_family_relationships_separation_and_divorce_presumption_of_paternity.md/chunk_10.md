You can [ apply to the Circuit Court for a declaration of parentage
](https://services.courts.ie/Family-Law/more-family-law-matters/paternity-and-
parentage) stating that you are or are not the father, mother or parents of a
child. Similarly, a child (as an adult) can apply for a declaration stating
that a person or persons named is or is not their father, mother or parents.
This can be done even if the parent is dead.

You must include relevant evidence to prove that you are or are not the
child’s parent, for example, a paternity test result.

You must also attend in court on the day to make your application.

After considering all the evidence, including any contrary evidence, the court
will decide if parentage has or has not been proven.

The court will then make a formal declaration of parentage in writing. This
sets out the court’s findings, which all parties (mother, alleged father) must
follow.

A declaration of parentage can be used to add the father’s details to his
child’s birth certificate.
