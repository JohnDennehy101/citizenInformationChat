###  Cost of paternity test

The costs of paternity testing depends on the type of test selected. The type
of test you choose to do depends on what you need the test for, for example,
for court proceedings.

Paternity testing is not part of the public health system so you will have to
pay for any tests. Depending on the situation, the court may make an order for
who should pay the costs, or if they should be shared.
