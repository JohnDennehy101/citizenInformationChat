##  Getting a PPS number for a child

A person who is under 18 years of age is considered a child for PPS number
applications.

Children born in Ireland are given a PPS number if they are registered with
the General Register Office (GRO) within 3 months of their birth. In this
case, you do not need to apply for your child’s PPS number.

You must apply for a child’s PPS number if:

  * The child’s birth is not registered within 3 months 
  * The child is born in Ireland and both parents’ addresses are outside Ireland 
  * The child is living in Ireland, but not born in Ireland 

One of the parents or guardians must have a PPS number for the child to be
registered and linked with their data.
