###  Applying from outside Ireland

You can apply for a PPS number if you are living outside Ireland and need a
PPS number for an [ interaction with a specified body
](https://www.gov.ie/en/collection/4bc1b4-personal-public-service-number-
register-of-users/) in Ireland. For example, someone who is a [ beneficiary
under an Irish will ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/death/before-a-
death/making-a-will/) may need a PPS number before a grant of probate can
issue.

The DSP's Client Identity Services (CIS) has a service for non-resident
applicants who need a PPS number and cannot attend at a designated PPS
Registration Centre.

You cannot use this service if you are living in, or intend to relocate to,
Ireland for any period of time. Read our page about [ PPS numbers for
returning Irish emigrants and their families
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/returning-to-ireland/applying-for-
social-welfare/pps-numbers-for-returning-irish-emigrants-and-families/) .

If you are living in Northern Ireland or the United Kingdom and are working in
Ireland (a cross-border worker), you must apply for a PPS number at a
designated [ PPS Number Allocation Centre
](http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/Personal-Public-Service-Number-Registration-
Centres-by-Count.aspx) .
