##  Introduction

The HSE audiology service provides help with hearing loss for children and
adults.

The audiology service is free for all children under 18 and eligible adults in
Ireland. It is also free for students until they leave third level education.

To use the service, you'll need a medical professional (such as your GP) to
refer you. In some cases, your GP may refer you to an ear, nose and throat
(ENT) consultant at a hospital.
