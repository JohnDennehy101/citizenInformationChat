##  Taking your complaint further

Always complain first to the person who sold you the car.

If your complaint can't be resolved by the seller themselves, you can make a
formal complaint to the relevant trade or professional body.

Where the trader is not a member of any trade or professional body or you
bought the car from a private seller, you can consider [ taking a civil case
](/en/justice/civil-law/taking-and-appealing-a-civil-case/) or using the [
small claims procedure ](/en/justice/courts-system/small-claims-court/) .
