##  Introduction

When you buy a used car from a trader (a car dealer, garage or a business
selling on an online marketplace), you have similar consumer rights as when [
buying a new car ](/en/consumer/cars/buying-a-new-car/) .

You can expect the car to meet certain conditions of quality and durability
and match what was set out in the contract. While you can’t expect a used car
to be the same standard as a new one, the quality should reflect the price you
paid. If you buy at an auction you don’t have the same rights if the car is
'sold as seen'. Check the auction's conditions of sale before you buy.

If you buy from a private seller, you also have fewer legal rights. This is
because consumer law applies to contracts between a trader and a consumer and
does not cover consumer-to-consumer deals.
