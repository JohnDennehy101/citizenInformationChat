###  Car is still under warranty

If your car was sold with a manufacturer’s warranty, this provides extra
protections. Check the terms and conditions to see if the warranty is still in
date, what problems are covered and what the seller’s obligations are.

Used car warranties are agreed between you and the dealer when you are
negotiating the sale. They are usually non-transferable. This means that you
will have to go back to the garage or car dealer you bought the car from to
get repairs done under that warranty.

A warranty or guarantee gives you extra protections but it does not replace [
your statutory rights ](/en/consumer/consumer-laws/your-consumer-rights/) when
goods are faulty. The seller still has a legal duty to provide you with a
repair, replacement or refund if the car turns out not to be of satisfactory
quality and durability or match what was set out in the contract.
