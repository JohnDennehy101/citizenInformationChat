###  How to apply for a Senior SmartPass

To get a Senior SmartPass, you must fill in an application form (FTNI1). You
can get this form from your local Intreo Centre or Social Welfare Branch
Office. It is **not possible to get this form online** .

You should not use a photocopy of the form as each form is barcoded. The
application form must be filled in with **black ink** only and returned **in
person** (not posted) to your Intreo Centre or Social Welfare Branch Office.

You must bring each of the following items with your application form to your
Intreo Centre or Social Welfare Branch Office:

  * Your Irish Free Travel pass/Public Services Card 
  * Proof of your address, (for example, a gas, electricity, phone bill or bank statement) 
  * Proof of your identity, (for example, your driving licence, passport or another form of photo identification) 
  * A recent passport standard colour photograph 

It may take up to 6 weeks to process your application. There is further
information on the [ extension of the Free Travel Scheme
](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/ba6e26-operational-guidelines-free-travel-
scheme/) .

**Travelling with a partner or companion**

A spouse, civil partner, cohabitant or companion cannot travel with you for
free on public transport within Northern Ireland.

However, your Irish Free Travel allows your spouse, civil partner, cohabitant
or companion to travel for free on certain cross-border services between
Ireland and Northern Ireland. For example, a cross-border train journey that
starts in Ireland and ends in Northern Ireland or vice versa.
