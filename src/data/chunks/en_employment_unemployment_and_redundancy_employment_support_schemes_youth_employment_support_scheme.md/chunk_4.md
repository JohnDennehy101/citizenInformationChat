##  How did YESS work?

The DSP provided a case officer, who was in contact with you and your host
organisation throughout your placement. The placement was monitored with
monthly reporting to make sure that it continued to meet the scheme
guidelines.

**Training and development**

Participants could get a [ Training Support Grant
](http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/Training-Support-Grant.aspx) of up to €500 if
needed. The grant was available up 2 times in a 12-month period. The grant was
increased from €500 to €1,000 under the [ July Jobs Stimulus
](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/84add-july-stimulus-social-protection/) .

**Duration of scheme**

The scheme lasted for 3 months, with the option to extend the placement to 6
months if the DSP agreed. Participants could spend a maximum of 6 months on a
placement with the same host organisation.

You could be eligible to do 3 placements in total, up to a maximum period of
18 months (78 weeks).

Participants worked 24 hours per week over 3 days or 4 days.
