##  How to apply for a short-stay visa

You apply for a visa online. You complete a separate application for each
person travelling, including children. After you have submitted the visa form,
you have 30 days to send the supporting documents. It’s a good idea to prepare
your documents before completing the form.

You pay a fee of €60 for each application. A multiple entry visa costs €100.

When you have submitted the form, you will get a summary of your application.
This includes:

  * Your visa application transaction number 
  * Your application summary sheet 
  * Details of the application office where you should send your documents 

You send the signed summary sheet with your documents.
