###  Letter of invitation

If you are visiting someone in Ireland, you should send a letter of invitation
written by them. The letter should have information about how they know you,
the dates you are visiting them and why they are inviting you to Ireland.

They should include a colour copy of their passport or national identity card.
If they are from outside the EEA, Switzerland and UK, they must include a copy
of their Irish Resident Permit and the current immigration stamp in their
passport.

The letter must also say that they understand you must:

  * Obey the conditions of your visa in full 
  * Leave Ireland before your visa expires 
  * Not rely on public services or become a burden on the State
