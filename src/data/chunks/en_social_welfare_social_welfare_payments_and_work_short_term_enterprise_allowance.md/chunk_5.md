###  Help with starting a business

In addition to income support (your weekly payment), you can also get
financial support with the costs of setting up your business. These supports
are provided under a scheme called the [ Enterprise Support Grant (ESG)
](https://www.gov.ie/en/service/52fb76-enterprise-support-grant/) . (The ESG
replaced the Technical Assistance and Training Scheme.)

You can only get the ESG if you have been approved for either the Back to Work
Enterprise Allowance or the Short-Term Enterprise Allowance. The business plan
you submit as part of your application for the scheme must set out the
rationale and requirement for financial support. The ESG is paid to people
getting the STEA on a pro-rata basis - a maximum of €1000 can be paid to
people on a 9-month STEA and a maximum of €625 to people on a 6-month STEA.
You must be able to make a matching contribution of between 10% and 20% to
access grant support. There is a [ list of items that qualify for grant
support (pdf)
](https://assets.gov.ie/19684/fd79766537b94c9f8fc49e0f0c0688d9.pdf) . You need
to provide documentary evidence of the costs (quotations from at least 2
suppliers or, if a single supplier, the reasons for choosing a single
supplier).

Some items not eligible for grant support under the ESG include:

  * Building/premises rental costs 
  * Cost of travel 
  * Insurance (except public liability) 
  * Personal clothing and uniforms (except protective clothing) 
  * Professional development programmes arranged by professional and regulatory bodies 
  * Purchase of any type of vehicle 
  * Stock-in-trade 
  * Training or education other than that specified 
  * Utility costs, connection or supply and local authority rates
