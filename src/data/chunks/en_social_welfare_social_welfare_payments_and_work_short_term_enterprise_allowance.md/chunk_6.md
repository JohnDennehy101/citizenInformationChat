##  Rates

If you qualify, the Short-Term Enterprise Allowance replaces your Jobseekerâ€™s
Benefit or Jobseeker's Benefit Self-Employed. The STEA will be paid at the
same rate as your JB or JBSE, including any increases for adult and child
dependants. It ends when your entitlement to JB or JBSE ends.

You do not pay PRSI or Universal Social Charge on the STEA. However the STEA
is subject to [ income tax ](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-
system/claiming-a-social-welfare-payment/taxation-of-social-welfare-payments/)
in the same way as JB or JBSE. (Note that this is different from the [ Back to
Work Enterprise Allowance ](/en/social-welfare/social-welfare-payments-and-
work/back-to-work-enterprise-allowance/) which is not taxable).
