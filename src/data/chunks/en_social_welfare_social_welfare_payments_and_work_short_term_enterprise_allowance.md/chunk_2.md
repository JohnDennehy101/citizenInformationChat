##  Introduction

The Short-Term Enterprise Allowance (STEA) gives support to people who have
lost their job and want to start their own business.

To qualify you must be getting Jobseeker’s Benefit (JB) or Jobseeker’s Benefit
Self-Employed (JBSE). There is no qualifying period, which means you do not
need to have been getting JB or JBSE for a certain period of time. However,
you will not qualify if you are getting JB or JBSE and working part-time.

The Short-Term Enterprise Allowance is paid instead of your JB or JBSE for a
maximum of 9 months. It ends when your entitlement to JB or JBSE ends (that is
at either 9 or 6 months).
