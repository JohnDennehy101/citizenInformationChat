####  **Refer it to the Ombudsman**

If you are not happy with the outcome of an appeal or complaint, you can refer
it to the [ Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/consumer/financial-products/your-
rights-when-buying-financial-products/) . The Financial Services and Pensions
Ombudsman cannot deal with complaints against the Irish Bank Resolution
