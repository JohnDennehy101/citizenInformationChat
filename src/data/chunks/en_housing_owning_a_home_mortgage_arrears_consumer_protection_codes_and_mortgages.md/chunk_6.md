####  **Mortgages on primary residences**

The CCMA only applies to mortgages on _primary residences_ . The CCMA defines
a primary residence as a residential property in the State which is the **only
residential property** owned by the borrower. You donâ€™t have to live in the
property for the protections of the CCMA to apply.
