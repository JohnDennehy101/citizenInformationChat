###  **What are the rules of the Consumer Protection Code?**

The Consumer Protection Code means that lenders must work with you if you are
having difficulty repaying a loan.

The lender must:

  * Have written procedures for handling arrears and make information available to you to help you deal with your arrears 
  * Contact you immediately if your account is in arrears for 10 business days to find out why you havenâ€™t made your repayment 
  * Ensure that the level of contact and communications from them, or from any third party acting for them, is proportionate and not excessive 

Lenders must not:

  * Contact you more than 3 times a month, if you did not request the contact. This is apart from other correspondence required by the CCMA or other regulatory requirements. This limit does not include missed calls or engaged numbers.
