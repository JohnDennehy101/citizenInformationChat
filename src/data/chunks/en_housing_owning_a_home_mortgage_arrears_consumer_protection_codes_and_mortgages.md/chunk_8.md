####  **Mortgage lenders**

The CCMA applies to all regulated mortgage lenders when they are dealing with
borrowers at risk of or in mortgage arrears on their primary residence. This
includes any mortgage lending activities outsourced by these lenders.

There have been changes to the protections that are available to you if your
mortgage is sold on to a third-party. For more information, see ‘ [ What rules
apply if my mortgage is sold
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/housing/owning-a-home/mortgage-
arrears/consumer-protection-codes-and-mortgages/#27067d) ’ below.

The CCMA does not apply to credit unions or to local authority home loans. See
‘ [ What are the rules about arrears if I have a local authority home loan
