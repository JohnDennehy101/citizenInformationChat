##  What is the Consumer Protection Code?

The Central Bank's [ Consumer Protection Code 2012
](http://www.centralbank.ie/consumer/cpc/Pages/home1.aspx) describes how
regulated lenders must treat consumers who are in arrears on loans including

  * Credit cards 
  * Personal loans 
  * Buy-to-let mortgages 

The Consumer Protection Code 2012 does not apply to mortgages on a primary
residence. These are covered by the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears,
described above.
