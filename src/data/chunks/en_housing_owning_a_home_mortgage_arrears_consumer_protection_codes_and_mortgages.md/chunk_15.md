###  **How does the CCMA work if I am not co-operating with my lender?**

If you are classified as not co-operating, you lose the protections of the
MARP. Your lender can start legal proceedings immediately which could result
in you losing your home.

You may be classified as _not co-operating_ with your lender if you:

  * Do not fully and honestly disclose (tell) significant information 
  * Do not provide relevant information within a reasonable time 
  * Are in arrears for 3 months and havenâ€™t contacted your lender or responded to their communications, or your response did not provide enough information for a complete assessment of your circumstances 
  * Have entered an alternative repayment arrangement, but after 3 months you have not made the alternative repayments in full 
  * Have not entered an alternative repayment arrangement, and after 3 months you have not fully paid your mortgage or cleared your arrears 

Before your lender classifies you as not co-operating, they must write to you,
giving you 20 business days to take specific actions so they can assess your
circumstances.

Your lender must also:

  * Tell you what steps you need to take to avoid being classified as not co-operating 
  * Warn you about the implications of not co-operating and suggest that you seek appropriate advice 
  * Explain what happens if you still owe money after repossession or sale 

You can appeal the decision to classify you as not co-operating.
