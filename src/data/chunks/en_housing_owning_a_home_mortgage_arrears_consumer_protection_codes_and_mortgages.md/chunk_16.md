###  **What are the CCMA timeframes?**

Lenders must wait 8 months before taking legal action about mortgages in
arrears. However, this does not apply if you are deliberately not co-operating
with your lender.

You must be given 3 monthsâ€™ notice before they can begin legal proceedings in
either of these situations:

  * You are co-operating with your lender but they do not offer you an [ alternative repayment arrangement ](/en/housing/owning-a-home/mortgage-arrears/alternative-mortgage-repayment-arrangements/)
  * You do not accept an alternative repayment arrangement they offer 

This notice period applies no matter how long your lender takes to assess your
case.

It will give you time to consider other options, such as:

  * Voluntary surrender 
  * Voluntary sale 
  * A [ Personal Insolvency Arrangement ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/money-and-tax/personal-finance/debt/personal-insolvency/personal-insolvency-arrangements/)
