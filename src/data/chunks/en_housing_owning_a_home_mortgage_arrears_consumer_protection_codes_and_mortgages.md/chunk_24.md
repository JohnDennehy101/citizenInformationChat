##  What are the rules about arrears if I have a local authority home loan?

If you are struggling to pay your local authority home loan, local authorities
have [ a Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process similar to the CCMA
](https://assets.gov.ie/108738/2295fd29-65d6-420e-84fb-d33abbcf7099.pdf) .
This sets out how local authorities must deal with people struggling to repay
their local authority home loan.

The local authority can make [ monetary arrangements
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1992/en/act/pub/0018/sec0011.html#zza18y1992s11)
with you that it thinks are fair and take account of your particular
circumstances. For example, they may let you pay the loan back over a longer
term or restructure the repayments in some other way.

They may also let you [ repay any outstanding payments by instalment
](http://www.oireachtas.ie/documents/bills28/acts/2009/a2209.pdf) , if they
think you will otherwise suffer undue hardship.

So, if you are in difficulty, you should contact your local authority to see
if they can make an alternative repayment arrangement with you.
