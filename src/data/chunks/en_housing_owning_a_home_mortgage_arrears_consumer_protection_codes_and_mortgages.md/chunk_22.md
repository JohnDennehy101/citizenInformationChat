###  **Can I make a complaint about my lender?**

The Consumer Protection Code 2012 has rules about how your lender must handle
any complaints you make about how they are dealing with you.

These complaints must be handled speedily, efficiently and fairly.

There are detailed rules about how often a firm should contact you to keep you
updated on your complaint.

The Central Bank has published a [ consumer guide to the Consumer Protection
Code (pdf) ](https://www.centralbank.ie/docs/default-

intermediaries/guidance/consumer-protection-code-v4.pdf?sfvrsn=4) .
