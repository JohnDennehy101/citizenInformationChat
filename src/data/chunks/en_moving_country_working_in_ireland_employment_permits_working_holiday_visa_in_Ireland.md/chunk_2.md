##  What is a working holiday visa?

Ireland has working holiday agreements with a number of different countries.
These allow young people from certain countries to travel to Ireland for
longer than a tourist visa, and to work while you are here to support your
travel expenses.

The main purpose of your trip should be to holiday and the work or studying
should be supplemental. If you are traveling primarily to work or to study you
should look into other visas.
