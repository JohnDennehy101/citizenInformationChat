##  Introduction

Like many Irish people living abroad, you may decide to move home because you
want your children to grow up in Ireland. You may want them to be educated in
Ireland, or simply be closer to grandparents and extended family.

This page outlines the supports and services you may need when returning to
Ireland with children.

If you need to get an Irish passport for your child, read our page [ Irish
citizenship and passports for children born abroad
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/returning-to-ireland/residency-and-
citizenship/irish-citizenship-and-passports-for-children-born-abroad/) .

If you have a baby after returning to live in Ireland, you can read [
