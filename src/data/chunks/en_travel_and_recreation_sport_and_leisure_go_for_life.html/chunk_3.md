###  Physical Activity Leaders (PAL)

The [ PAL programme ](https://ageandopportunity.ie/sport/pals/) aims to
promote greater participation by independent older people in physical activity
and recreational sports. Go for Life has trained over 1000 volunteers who act
as Physical Activity Leaders (PALs) for older people. PALs tend to be members
of community groups, such as active retirement associations or day centre
workers.
