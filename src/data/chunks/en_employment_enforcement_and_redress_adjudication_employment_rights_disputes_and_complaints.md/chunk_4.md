##  Who can make a complaint to the WRC?

You can make a complaint to the WRC if you are:

  * The person directly affected (that is the ‘direct complainant’) 
  * A _specified person_ acting on behalf of the direct complainant 

A specified person is someone who is named in the relevant employment law as
being entitled to present a complaint or refer a dispute, such as a trade
union representative.
