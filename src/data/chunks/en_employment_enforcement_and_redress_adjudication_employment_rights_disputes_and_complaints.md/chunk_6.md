###  How your complaint is handled

Your complaint can be dealt with by _mediation_ or _adjudication_ .

If both you and your employer agree to [ mediation
](/en/employment/enforcement-and-redress/workplace-mediation/) , a mediator
will help you reach a mutually acceptable agreement. This method often
prevents complaints from reaching the stage of a formal court hearing. The
mediation can be carried out by phone, video, or face-to-face meetings.

With adjudication, there is a public hearing (except in exceptional
circumstances) and an adjudication officer will make a formal judgment. See
‘How does adjudication work?’ below.
