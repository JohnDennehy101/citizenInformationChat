##  WRC procedural changes

Following a Supreme Court judgment, [ the law covering certain WRC procedures
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2021/act/29/enacted/en/print) has been
updated, as follows:

  * Hearings are now open to the public (except cases where there are ‘ [ special circumstances ](https://www.workplacerelations.ie/en/complaints_disputes/adjudication/workplace-relations-miscellaneous-provisions-act-2021/) ’) 
  * Decisions are no longer anonymised on publication 
  * WRC adjudicators now have statutory powers to [ administer an oath or affirmation ](https://www.workplacerelations.ie/en/complaints_disputes/adjudication/wrc-witness-guidelines/)
  * Giving false evidence under oath is a crime that can be prosecuted 

The changes are effective from 29 July 2021. You can read more in the [ WRC
guidance on Workplace Relations (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2021
