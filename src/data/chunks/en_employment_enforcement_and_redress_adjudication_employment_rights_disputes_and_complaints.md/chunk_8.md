###  Gathering your evidence

Before the hearing takes place, you must gather all the relevant evidence and
documentation to support your case. You must give this evidence to the
adjudication officer as soon as possible, and **no later than 15 working days
before the hearing** . You must also give a copy of all your evidence to the
other party (for instance, your employer).

Examples of evidence include:

  * Emails or letters 
  * Minutes of meetings 
  * Contracts of employment or employee handbooks 
  * Sound recordings 
  * CCTV footage. 

The adjudication officer can decide not to allow you or your employer to
introduce documents on the day of the hearing or within 15 workings days of
the hearing date.
