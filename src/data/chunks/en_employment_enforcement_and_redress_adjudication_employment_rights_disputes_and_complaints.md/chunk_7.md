##  How does adjudication work?

If your complaint is not dealt with through [ mediation
](/en/employment/enforcement-and-redress/workplace-mediation/) , or if the
mediation is not successful, it is referred to an independent ‘adjudication
officer’. The adjudication officer generally conducts an inquiry.

In some cases, the WRC may decide to deal with the complaint by written
submissions only, unless either party objects within 42 days of being
informed. You can read about the [ WRC procedures in the investigation of
employment and equality complaints (pdf).
