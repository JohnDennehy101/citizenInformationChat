##  How to make a complaint

If you cannot resolve your complaint informally with your employer, you can
make a formal complaint to the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC) using its
[ online complaint form
](https://www.workplacerelations.ie/en/Complaints_Disputes/Refer_a_Dispute_Make_a_Complaint/)
.

Depending on your complaint, you may have to take ‘pre-complaint steps’, such
as gathering supporting documents and sending them to the WRC as part of the
complaint. For example, if you are making a complaint under the National
Minimum Wage Act, you need to request a ‘statement of earnings’ from your
employer before making your complaint to the WRC.

You must make your complaint to the WRC **within 6 months** of the date of the
alleged breach of the Act. The time limit may be extended by a further 6
months if there was reasonable cause for the delay.
