##  How is the adjudicator's decision enforced?

The employer has 56 days to carry out the decision of the adjudication
officer. If the employer fails to do so, then the employee, the WRC, the
employee’s trade union or _excepted body_ can apply to the District Court for
an order directing the employer to do so. An excepted body is a body that
represents the interests of a particular group of workers.

In general, the District Court must make the order. If the decision was to
reinstate or re-engage the employee, the District Court may substitute an
order to pay compensation. The compensation can be up to 104 weeks’ pay, which
is calculated using the rules under the Unfair Dismissals Acts 1977–2015. The
District Court may also order interest to be paid.

An employer who fails to comply with an order directing them to pay
compensation is committing an offence (unless they can show they were unable
to comply due to financial circumstances).
