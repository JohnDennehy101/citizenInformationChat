##  If you have a workplace complaint or dispute

If you have a complaint about your employment rights, you should first speak
to your employer. If you cannot resolve your complaint informally, you can
make a formal complaint to the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC).

Your complaint will be referred to either:

  * A _mediation officer_ if the complaint can be resolved through [ mediation ](/en/employment/enforcement-and-redress/workplace-mediation/) and neither party objects 
  * An _adjudicator_ if either party objects to it being dealt with through mediation or if the mediation is unsuccessful 

As part of the adjudication service, adjudication officers investigate
disputes, grievances and claims that individuals or small groups of workers
make under employment legislation.

Complaints can be about [ redundancy ](/en/employment/unemployment-and-
redundancy/redundancy/what-is-redundancy/) , [ unfair dismissal
](/en/employment/unemployment-and-redundancy/dismissal/unfair-dismissal/) , [
minimum notice ](/en/employment/starting-work-and-changing-job/changing-
job/giving-notice/) , [ minimum wage ](/en/employment/employment-rights-and-
conditions/pay-and-employment/minimum-wage/) , [ hours of work
](/en/employment/employment-rights-and-conditions/hours-of-work/) and [ leave
](/en/employment/employment-rights-and-conditions/leave-and-holidays/) . The
WRC can adjudicate on complaints made under the employment legislation listed
in [ Schedule 5
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2015/act/16/schedule/5/enacted/en/html#sched5)
of the Workplace Relations Act 2015.
