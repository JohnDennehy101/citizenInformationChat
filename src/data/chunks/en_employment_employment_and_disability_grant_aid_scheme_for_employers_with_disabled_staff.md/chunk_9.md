####  If you get the Disablement Pension at less than 20% for life

If you get a Disablement Pension or Gratuity assessed at less than 20% for
life, or if you have been awarded a Disablement Benefit based on a provisional
assessment, you need:

  * A confidential medical report form, filled out by your doctor, confirming that you have a disability which could cause a shortfall in productivity
