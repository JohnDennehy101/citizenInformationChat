###  If you get a disability payment

You can qualify for the WSS without a medical assessment if you are getting
one of the following disability payments:

  * [ Disability Allowance ](/en/social-welfare/disability-and-illness/disability-allowance/)
  * [ Blind Pension ](/en/social-welfare/disability-and-illness/blind-persons-pension/)
  * [ Disablement Pension ](/en/social-welfare/disability-and-illness/disablement-benefit/) awarded at 20% or more for life 

You can also qualify for the WSS if you are getting an [ Illness Benefit
](/en/social-welfare/disability-and-illness/illness-benefit/) , [ Invalidity
Pension ](/en/social-welfare/disability-and-illness/invalidity-pension/) or [
Partial Capacity Benefit ](/en/social-welfare/disability-and-illness/partial-
capacity-benefit/) . However, you must come off these payments to take part in
the WSS.

Currently, if you are getting Disability Allowance or Blind Pension, you can
stay on your payment alongside the WSS, but it will be reduced. You must
contact the Disability Allowance or Blind Pension section in DSP to tell them
you are starting work. Read more about [ how your payment will be reduced
](/en/social-welfare/social-welfare-payments-and-work/disability-payments-and-
work/) .
