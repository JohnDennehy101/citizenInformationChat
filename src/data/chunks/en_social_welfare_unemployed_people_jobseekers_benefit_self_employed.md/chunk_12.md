](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/claiming-a-social-welfare-
payment/claiming-an-increase-in-your-social-welfare-payment-for-an-adult-
dependant/) and [ child dependant ](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-
system/claiming-a-social-welfare-payment/claiming-and-increase-in-your-
payment-for-a-child-dependant/) . Your average weekly earnings do not affect
the amount you get for a child dependant.

From June 2024, if you are getting an Increase for Qualified Adult, any child
maintenance they get is no longer included in the income test. However, if
they get maintenance that is not child maintenance, this will continue to be
included in their assessed income.

**Average weekly earnings**

Jobseeker’s Benefit (Self-Employed) rates are graduated according to your
earnings in the relevant tax year. Your average weekly earnings are your gross
weekly income in the relevant tax year divided by the number of Class S
contributions paid in that year.

The relevant tax year is the second-last complete tax year before the year in
which your claim is made. For example, if you claim Jobseeker's Benefit in
2024 the relevant tax year is 2022. If you only qualify for a reduced payment,
it may be of greater benefit for you to claim [ Jobseeker's Allowance
](/en/social-welfare/unemployed-people/jobseekers-allowance/) instead of
Jobseeker's Benefit (Self-Employed).

If you had no earnings but got PUP in 2021, you will meet the average weekly
earnings requirement for a claim where 2021 is your relevant tax year, and get
the maximum rate of Jobseeker’s Benefit. However, if you had earnings in 2021,
your average weekly earnings will be calculated by dividing your gross yearly
earnings by the number of paid contributions.
