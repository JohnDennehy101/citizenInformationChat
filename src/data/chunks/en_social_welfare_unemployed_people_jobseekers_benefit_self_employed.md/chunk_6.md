###  Jobseeker's Benefit (Self-Employed) and work

To get Jobseeker's Benefit (Self-Employed) you must stop all self-employment
activity. However, you can work as an employee for up to 3 days each week and
get Jobseeker's Benefit (Self-Employed).

If you are working for part of a week, your payment will be based on a 5-day
payment week. This means that for each day that you are employed, 1/5th of the
normal rate of Jobseeker's Benefit (Self-Employed) is deducted. For example,
if you get part-time work for 2 days, you will get 3/5ths of the normal rate
for that week and you get part-time work for 3 days, you will get 2/5ths of
the normal rate for the week. You must still be unemployed for at least 4 days
out of 7 to claim Jobseeker's Benefit (Self-Employed). You can read [ FAQS
