##  How to apply

You apply for an _It Makes Sense_ loan through your credit union. If you are
not a member, you will need to apply to join.

Not all credit unions take part in the scheme â€“ view a [ list of participating
credit unions ](https://www.creditunion.ie/what-we-offer/loans/it-makes-sense-
loan/participating-credit-unions/) where you can apply.

The scheme rules may differ between credit unions. For example, some credit
unions may offer loans at lower amounts or ask a member to save for a certain
amount of time before applying for a loan. Contact your credit union for
details.
