###  Applying for an _It Makes Sense_ loan

If you collect your weekly social welfare payment at the post office, when you
apply for the loan you need to bring 2 consecutive social welfare slips (from
within the previous 4 weeks).

If you get your social welfare payment into a bank or credit union account,
you need to bring recent statements for the account. Check with the credit
union how many statements you need to bring.

Your local credit union can help you fill out a loan application form.

The credit union will decide whether to grant a loan and the amount of the
loan.
