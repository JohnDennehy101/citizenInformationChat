##  Introduction

If you are convicted of a sexual offence, you will be required to notify the [
Garda Síochána (the Irish police) ](/en/justice/law-enforcement/garda-
siochana-national-police-force/) of your name and address for a period deemed
by the court to reflect the seriousness of your offence, even if no prison
sentence is imposed.

If you are sentenced to prison, you may also be subject to additional
monitoring upon release to assist with your reintegration into the community
and reduce the likelihood of your reoffending.

The rules governing the monitoring and supervision of sex offenders in Ireland
are set out in the [ Sex Offenders Act 2001
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2001/act/18/enacted/en/html) .
