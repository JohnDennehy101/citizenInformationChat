##  Treatment of sex offenders

The [ Irish Prison Service ](https://www.irishprisons.ie/prisoner-
services/treatment-of-sex-offenders/) operates a range of individual and
group-based therapeutic services aimed at reducing participants’ likelihood of
re-offending.

The main treatment programme, [ Building Better Lives
](https://www.irishprisons.ie/prisoner-services/treatment-of-sex-offenders/) ,
is provided by a specialist team of psychologists and probation officers.

The criteria for participation include:

  * A prison sentence longer than 18 months 
  * Full admission, on the part of the prisoner, of the offence and harm caused to the victim 
  * Capacity and willingness to participate in group therapy 
  * Stable mental health 
  * Some literacy 

Alternative prison-based treatment services include one-to-one therapy,
interventions by approved ‘in-reach’ services and interventions available to
prisoners generally.

Under the Irish Prison Service’s [ Sex Offender Management Policy (PDF)
](http://www.irishprisons.ie/images/pdf/sexoffenderspolicy.pdf) , [ Arbour
Hill Prison ](http://www.irishprisons.ie/index.php/prison/arbour-hill/) is
designated as the national centre for imprisoned sex offenders with a full
range of therapeutic interventions available.

[ Midlands Prison ](http://www.irishprisons.ie/index.php/portlaoise-prison-
campus/midlands-prison) and [ Wheatfield Place of Detention
](http://www.irishprisons.ie/index.php/west-dublin-prison-campus/wheatfield-
place-of-detention) are designated as satellite centres where a narrower range
of therapeutic interventions are available. Prisoners committed initially to
other prisons are transferred to the satellite centres unless exceptional
circumstances prevail.
