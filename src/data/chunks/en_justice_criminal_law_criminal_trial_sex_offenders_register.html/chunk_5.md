###  How must an offender notify Gardaí?

If you are required to provide certain information to the Gardaí under the Sex
Offenders Act 2001, you must give notification by going to any Garda station
which is a Divisional Headquarters, or a Garda station designated for this
purpose, and giving the information in person to a member of that Garda
station.

If you have a certified disability preventing you from attending the Garda
station, the Gardaí may arrange for the notification to be taken at your home
or another suitable location.

If you are outside Ireland for 3 days or more and did not intend to be outside
the State for over 3 days, you can send a written notification with the
required information by post to a Divisional Headquarters, or a Garda station
designated for this purpose. You must do this within 6 days of being outside
the State.

**After the Gardaí receive the notification**

When the Gardaí receive the notification, they acknowledge it in writing. The
Gardaí also complete a Sex Offenders Notification Form, which contains the sex
offender’s address and other details. A copy of the form is sent to the
offender and a copy is kept at the Garda station. The original completed form
is sent to SOMIU.

SOMIU monitor sex offenders by cross-referencing Notification Forms with
Certificates of Conviction. SOMIU also receive email notifications when
information is entered onto PULSE (the Gardaí’s computer database) about a sex
offender, so they can act on any information that needs attention.

At a local level, the Gardaí have nominated Inspectors in each local district
who are responsible for monitoring and managing sex offenders in their
district.
