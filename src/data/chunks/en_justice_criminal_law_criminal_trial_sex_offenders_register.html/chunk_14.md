###  What does a sex offender order do?

The terms of each sex offender order depends on the evidence given to the
court by the Chief Superintendent.

If, for example, the Gardaí apply to the court for a sex offender order
because they are concerned that a sex offender is loitering near a school
playground, then the court can include a condition in the order that prevents
the offender from going within a certain distance of school playgrounds.

The Gardaí apply for sex offender orders and ensure that offenders comply with
these orders. If a sex offender order is in place, the offender is also
subject to the notification requirements set out in [ Part 2 of the Sex
Offenders Act 2001
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2001/act/18/enacted/en/print#part2) (for
more see ‘sex offenders register’ above).
