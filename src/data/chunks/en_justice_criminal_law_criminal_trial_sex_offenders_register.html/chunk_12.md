##  Post-release supervision orders

If you are convicted of certain sexual offences the court will consider
whether to impose a sentence with post-release supervision.

Supervised by [ the Probation Service ](/en/justice/probation-and-welfare-
services/probation-service/) , post-release supervision means that an offender
is monitored when they are released from prison to ensure that they comply
with the conditions of a post-release supervision order.

When considering whether to impose post-release supervision, the court can
hear evidence or submissions from any concerned person and must take into
account the need to:

  * Protect the public from serious harm from the offender 
  * Prevent the offender from committing further sexual offences 
  * Rehabilitate the offender 

The court can also include specific conditions in the supervision order. For
example they can:

  * Prohibit the sex offender from attending certain places, such as schools, sports-clubs and play-grounds 
  * Require that the sex offender get psychological counselling or other appropriate treatment during the period of supervision 

However, the term of imprisonment and the length of the post-release
supervision order cannot be longer than the maximum possible sentence. The
offenderâ€™s probation officer can also apply to the court to change the
conditions of the post-release supervision order. Such an application can be
made in the month before the offender is due to be released from prison or
during the supervision period.

If imposing a post-release supervision order, the court must explain the
effect of the order, the consequences for non-compliance and the ability to
apply to have it varied.

Non-compliance with a supervision order is an offence. If you do not adhere to
the terms of your order, you can be liable, on summary conviction, to a [
class C fine ](/en/justice/criminal-law/criminal-trial/fines-for-criminal-
offences/) or to a prison sentence for a maximum of 12 months, or both.
