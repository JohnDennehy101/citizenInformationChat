###  How long does a sex offender order last?

A sex offender order remains in force for:

  * 5 years from the date the offender was notified of the order, or 
  * A longer period the court decides is appropriate 

The Gardaí can also apply to the [ Circuit Court ](/en/justice/courts-
system/circuit-court/) to change the original order. This normally happens if
the Gardaí believe that the sex offender’s behaviour has given rise to a
further cause for concern that isn’t addressed by the original order.
