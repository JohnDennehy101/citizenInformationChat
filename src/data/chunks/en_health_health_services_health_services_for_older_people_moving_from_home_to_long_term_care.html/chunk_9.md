###  **Choosing a nursing home**

Visit the HIQA website to [ find a nursing home in your area
](https://www.hiqa.ie/areas-we-work/find-a-centre/map) . You may also want to
read the HSEâ€™s [ guide to choosing a nursing home
](http://www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/4/olderpeople/residentialcare/Nursinghomechecklist.pdf)
.

When you choose a nursing home, you will be asked to sign a contract for care.
This sets out the rights and responsibilities for you and for the nursing
home.

You can read [ information about what you are entitled to expect in a nursing
home contract for care ](https://www.ccpc.ie/consumers/contracts-and-
services/nursing-homes/) from the Competition and Consumer Protection
Commission. It also explains what you can do if you think a contract for care
is unfair.
