###  Custody by agreement

Where you and your ex-partner agree, it is possible to decide on custody
arrangements for your child. You can reach agreement together yourselves, or
with the help of a mediator or a solicitor. If you decide, your agreement can
become a ‘Rule of Court’, by making an application to the court with the
agreement included. This means that it is treated the same as a court order in
contested proceedings and can be legally enforced like one.
