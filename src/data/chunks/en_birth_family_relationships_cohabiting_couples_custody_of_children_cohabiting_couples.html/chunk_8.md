##  Who can apply to the courts for custody?

Certain people can apply to the courts for custody of a child including:

  * The parent of a child who does not have automatic custody rights, or any parent of a child when the parents cannot agree on custody arrangements. It is not necessary for a father to have guardianship before he applies for child custody. 
  * A relative of the child, for example, brothers, sisters, aunts, uncles, and grandparents 
  * A parent's spouse, civil partner or cohabitant (for at least 3 years) with whom the child resides and where they shared parenting of the child for at least 2 years 
  * A person who lives with the child, if they have provided the child's day-to-day care for at least a year and there is no parent or guardian willing or able to exercise the powers and responsibilities of guardianship
