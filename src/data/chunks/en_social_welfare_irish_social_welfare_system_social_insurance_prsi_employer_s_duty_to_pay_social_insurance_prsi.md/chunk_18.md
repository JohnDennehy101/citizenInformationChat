###  Examples of PRSI calculations

**Example 1 - PRSI calculation when you earn €352.01 a week**  
---  
You earn €352.01 per week, so you get the maximum credit of €12.  Your PRSI is
calculated at 4% of your earnings, so: €352.01 x 4% = €14.08.  Then, subtract
the tax credit to reduce the PRSI you owe: €14.08 - €12 = €2.08  **You will
pay PRSI of €2.08 weekly.**  
  
If you earn more than €352.01, you can work out how much PRSI you will pay in
4 steps:

  1. Calculate one-sixth of your earnings over €352.01. 
  2. Subtract this from the maximum tapered credit of €12 to get your PRSI credit. 
  3. Calculate the basic PRSI charge at 4% of your earnings. 
  4. Deduct the PRSI credit from the PRSI charge to get the amount of PRSI you pay. 

**Example 2** **–** **PRSI calculation when you earn more than €352.01 a
week**  
---  
You have gross weekly earnings of €377 (before tax).  1\. Calculate one-sixth
of your earnings over €352.01:  €377 - €352.01 = €24.99.  €24.99 divided by 6
= €4.17.  2\. Subtract this from the maximum credit of €12 to get your PRSI
credit:  €12 - €4.17 = €7.83.  3\. Calculate the basic PRSI charge at 4% of
your earnings:  €377 x 4% = €15.08.  4\. Deduct the PRSI credit from the PRSI
charge to get the amount of PRSI you pay:  €15.08 - €7.83 = €7.25  **You will
pay PRSI of €7.25 weekly.**
