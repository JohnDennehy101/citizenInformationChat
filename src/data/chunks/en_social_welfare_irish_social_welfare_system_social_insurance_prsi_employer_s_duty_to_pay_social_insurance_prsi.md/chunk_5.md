##  How does PRSI work?

Your employer needs your [ Personal Public Service (PPS) number ](/en/social-
welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/personal-public-service-number/) to make
PRSI contributions for you.

The amount of PRSI you and your employer pay depends on how much you earn and
the type of work you do. Read more in our page [ social insurance classes
](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/social-insurance-prsi/social-
insurance-classes/) .

Your employer:

  * Deducts employee PRSI contributions directly from your wages, and 
  * Pays separate employer PRSI contributions for you, which are not deducted from your wages. 

Revenue collects all PRSI.

Your employer and the Department of Social Protection (DSP) keep a record PRSI
contributions made by you and your employer.

By law, you must get a [ payslip ](/en/employment/employment-rights-and-
conditions/pay-and-employment/pay-slip/) when you are paid. Your payslip must
show any deductions from your pay, including PRSI contributions.
