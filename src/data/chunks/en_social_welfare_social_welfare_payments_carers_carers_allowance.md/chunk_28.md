###  **Jobseeker's Transitional payment**

You cannot get Carer’s Allowance with [ Jobseeker's Transitional payment
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/unemployed-
people/jobseekers-transitional-payment/) (JST). However, if you are getting
JST and qualify for Carer’s Allowance, you can ask to be assessed for Carer’s
Allowance and One-Parent Family Payment (OFP).

If you get OFP, you can get half-rate Carer's Allowance.
