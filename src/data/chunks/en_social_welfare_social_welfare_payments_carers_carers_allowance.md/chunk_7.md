##  What counts as full-time care?

To get Carer’s Allowance, you must care full-time for someone who is:

  * Aged 16 or over, and who is so incapacitated that they need full-time care and attention for at least 12 months, **or**
  * Aged under 16, and for whom you get [ Domiciliary Care Allowance ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/disability-and-illness/domiciliary-care-allowance/) . 

Full-time care means:

  * You continuously supervise the person so they don’t put themselves in danger, **or**
  * You continuously supervise and assist the person throughout the day with personal care (for example, helping them to eat, drink, get washed and dressed). 

You must care for them at least 35 hours per week, over 5 to 7 days.

The Department of Social Protection (DSP) will decide if you are providing
full time care.
