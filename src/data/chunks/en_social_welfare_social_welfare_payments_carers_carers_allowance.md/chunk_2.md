##  What is Carer’s Allowance?

Carer's Allowance is a weekly social welfare payment to people who care for
someone because of their:

  * Age 
  * Disability, or 
  * Illness (including mental illness). 

To qualify for the payment, your income must be below a certain amount (see
‘How your income is assessed for Carer’s Allowance’ below).

If you care for 2 or more people, your rate of Carer's Allowance is increased
by 50% (maximum) each week.

If you get another social welfare payment, you may get [ half-rate Carer’s
Allowance ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/carers/half-
rate-carers-allowance/) .
