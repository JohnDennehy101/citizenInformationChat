###  **Payment after a death**

If the person you care for dies, you will continue getting Carer's Allowance
for 12 weeks after their death. This also applies to people who are ‘care-
sharing’ (see above).

If you die, your spouse or civil partner can get your Carer’s Allowance for 6
weeks after your death. They must already be getting a separate social welfare
payment for themselves.
