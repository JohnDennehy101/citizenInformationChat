##  ATM cards and debit cards

A government stamp duty of 12 cent applies to ATM withdrawals (this is in
addition to any charge from your bank). This is capped at €2.50 for ATM cards
and €5 for combined (ATM and debit) cards. This stamp duty is collected in
arrears. This means that charges for 2023 are charged to your account on 31
December 2023.
