##  Pensions when you have worked in more than one country

You may qualify for a pension from Ireland when you reach pension age.

A [ State Pension (Contributory) ](/en/social-welfare/older-and-retired-
people/state-pension-contributory/) is based on your PRSI contributions. If
you have not paid enough contributions to qualify for a pension, you may still
qualify for an EU pro-rata pension. A pro-rata pension is based on your
contributions in Ireland and other EEA countries. Ireland pays you based on
the proportion of these contributions that you paid in Ireland.

If you live in Ireland when you reach 66 and you do not qualify for the
maximum State Pension (Contributory), you may be entitled to the [ State
Pension (Non-Contributory) ](/en/social-welfare/older-and-retired-
people/state-pension-non-contributory/) .

It is possible to get a pension from more than one country if you meet the
qualifying conditions for each country.
