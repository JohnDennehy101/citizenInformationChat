###  Payments based on your income

Some payments are [ based on your means ](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-
welfare-system/means-test-for-social-welfare-payments/means-test/) . In a
means test the Department of Social Protection examines all your sources of
income (including capital and savings). To get a means-tested payment, your
income must be below a certain amount.

You must also meet the [ Habitual Residence Condition ](/en/social-
welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/social-assistance-payments/habitual-
residence-condition/) to get a means-tested payment. For some payments, the
residence rules do not apply to EEA or Swiss workers. See ‘residence rules for
means-tested payments’ below.

Each payment has its own qualifying criteria and rules about who can qualify.
Detailed information is available in our [ social welfare section
