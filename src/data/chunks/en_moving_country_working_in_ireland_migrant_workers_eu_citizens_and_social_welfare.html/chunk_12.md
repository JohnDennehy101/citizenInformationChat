###  Different retirement ages

Pension age is not the same across the EU. This means you may reach the
pension age in a country you worked in, before you reach the pension age in
Ireland. Your Irish contributions cannot be assessed for your pro-rata pension
until you reach the Irish pension age of 66.

For example, if you worked in a country with a lower pension age than Ireland,
the years that you worked in Ireland cannot be used to increase that pension
because you have not reached the Irish pension age of 66. When you reach 66,
you can claim an Irish pension, your original pension may be increased and you
may also get a pension from Ireland.
