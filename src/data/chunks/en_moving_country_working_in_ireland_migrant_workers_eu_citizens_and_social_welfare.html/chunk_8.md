###  Losing your job

The type of payment you can get when you become unemployed depends on how long
were working in Ireland, or if you can use your social insurance contributions
from another EEA country. You may get:

  * [ Jobseeker’s Benefit (JB) ](/en/social-welfare/unemployed-people/jobseekers-benefit/) \- You must meet the criteria and have enough social insurance contributions. You can use contributions paid in another EEA country or Switzerland before you came to Ireland, but your most recent contribution must have been paid in Ireland. 
  * [ Jobseeker’s Allowance (JA) ](/en/social-welfare/unemployed-people/jobseekers-allowance/) \- You must meet the criteria and the habitual residence condition (see below). This is a means-tested payment. 
  * [ Supplementary Welfare Allowance ](/en/social-welfare/supplementary-welfare-schemes/supplementary-welfare-allow/) \- You can claim this for up to 6 months if you worked in Ireland for less than a year, or for as long as you are looking for work if you worked in Ireland for more than a year. This a means-tested payment. 

If the business closed down or reduced its workforce, you may be entitled to a
[ redundancy payment ](/en/employment/unemployment-and-
redundancy/redundancy/redundancy-payments/) .
