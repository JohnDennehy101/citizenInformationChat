##  Residence rules for means-tested payments

Each social welfare payment has its own conditions. You can read about the
rules for each payment in our [ social welfare section
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social_welfare/) .

Some payments are only available if you are ‘ [ habitually resident
](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/social-assistance-
payments/habitual-residence-condition/) ’ in Ireland. The Department of Social
Protection assesses if you have:

  1. The [ legal right to reside in Ireland ](/en/moving-country/moving-to-ireland/rights-of-residence-in-ireland/residence-rights-eu-national/)
  2. A proven close link to Ireland. 

EEA and Swiss **workers** (including those who kept their worker status when
they stopped working) do not need to satisfy the habitual residence condition
to get a family payment or [ Supplementary Welfare Allowance ](/en/social-
welfare/supplementary-welfare-schemes/supplementary-welfare-allow/) .

You can read more about the [ habitual residence condition ](/en/social-
welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/social-assistance-payments/habitual-
residence-condition/) for social welfare payments.
