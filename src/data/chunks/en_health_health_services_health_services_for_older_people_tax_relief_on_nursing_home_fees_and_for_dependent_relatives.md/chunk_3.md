###  Tax relief on nursing home fees

You claim tax relief for nursing home fees under the general scheme for tax
relief on medical expenses.

You can claim this relief at your highest rate of [ income tax
](http://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/money_and_tax/tax/income_tax/) if the
nursing home provides 24-hour on-site nursing care.

If you are paying the charges for a nursing home you can claim the tax relief
whether you are in the nursing home yourself or you are paying for another
person to be there.
