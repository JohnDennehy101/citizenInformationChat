###  **3\. You do not get any salary while on maternity leave and your
Maternity Benefit is paid directly to you.**

Revenue will reduce your tax credits and rate band to account for the tax
payable on your Maternity Benefit. They will then send a revised tax credit
certificate to your employer. If your only income is Maternity Benefit, you
will probably pay very little or no tax (since your total tax credits will
probably exceed your total tax liability).

If you are not entitled to any pay on the usual pay day, you may contact your
employer to request repayment of any tax that might be due. Alternatively,
when you go back to work after maternity leave, any refund of tax which may be
due can be calculated.
