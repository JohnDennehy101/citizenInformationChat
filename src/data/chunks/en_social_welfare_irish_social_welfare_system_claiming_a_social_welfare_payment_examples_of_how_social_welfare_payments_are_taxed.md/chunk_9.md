##  Taxation of Illness Benefit and Injury Benefit

If you are absent from work due to illness and you get (or your employer gets
on your behalf) [ Illness Benefit
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/social-welfare-
payments/disability-and-illness/disability-benefit/) or [ Injury Benefit
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/social-welfare-
payments/disability-and-illness/injury-benefit/) , Revenue will take account
of the amount of Illness or Injury Benefit paid when they adjust your tax
credits or review the tax affairs of your spouse or civil partner.

You do not pay PRSI or USC.

The Department of Social Protection (DSP) tells Revenue the amount of taxable
Illness or Injury Benefit you are getting, and the date the payment started.
DSP does not tell your employer the amount of Illness or Injury Benefit you
are getting.
