##  Taxation of Jobseeker’s Benefit and One-Parent Family Payment

If you work and get [ Jobseeker’s Benefit (JB)
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/social-welfare-
payments/unemployed-people/jobseekers-benefit/) , the taxable part of your JB
is collected by adjusting your tax credits and standard rate cut off point to
account for the tax payable.

The [ One-Parent Family Payment
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/social-welfare-
payments/families-and-children/one-parent-family-payment/) is taxed in the
same way. You don’t pay PRSI or USC.
