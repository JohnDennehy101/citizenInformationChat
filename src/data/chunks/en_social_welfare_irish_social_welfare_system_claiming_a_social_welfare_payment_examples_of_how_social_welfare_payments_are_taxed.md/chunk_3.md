###  Example

**The following example explains how** [ **Maternity Benefit** ](/en/social-
welfare/families-and-children/maternity-benefit/) **is taxed. The same rules
also apply to** [ **Adoptive Benefit** ](/en/social-welfare/families-and-
children/adoptive-benefit/) **,** [ **Paternity Benefit** ](/en/social-
welfare/families-and-children/paternity-benefit/) **,** [ **Parent’s Benefit**
](/en/social-welfare/families-and-children/parents-benefit/) **, and** [
**Health and Safety Benefit** ](/en/social-welfare/families-and-
children/health-safety-benefit/) **.**

The Department of Social Protection (DSP) pays Maternity Benefit without
deducting tax. However, the DSP will tell Revenue the amount of Maternity
Benefit you are getting.

If you pay tax through [ the PAYE system ](/en/money-and-tax/tax/income-
tax/how-your-tax-is-calculated/) , Revenue will (where possible) automatically
reduce your annual tax credits and rate bands to account for the tax payable
on your Maternity Benefit (see more examples of how Maternity Benefit is taxed
below).

If you are self-employed and [ pay your tax through the self-assessment system
](/en/money-and-tax/tax/income-tax/taxation-of-self-employed-people/) , you
should include details of any Maternity Benefit received in your annual tax
return.
