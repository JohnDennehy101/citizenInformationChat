###  **1\. You are paid your full or partial salary by your employer and your
Maternity Benefit is paid directly to them.**

Revenue will reduce your tax credits and rate band to account for the tax
payable on your Maternity Benefit, and in this way collect the tax due.
Revenue will then send a revised tax credit certificate to your employer. Your
employer should only deduct tax, USC and PRSI on the difference between the
salary paid and Maternity Benefit.
