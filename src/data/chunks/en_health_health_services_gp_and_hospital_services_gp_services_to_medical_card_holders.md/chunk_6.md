##  Medical services not covered

Even if you have a medical card or GP visit card, your GP does not have to
provide the following services for free:

  * Eye tests for a driving licence 
  * Reports for life assurance 
  * Medical certificates for absence from work 

If you need a medical report to apply for a social welfare payment, the [
Department of Social Protection ](http://www.welfare.ie/) may cover the fee.
