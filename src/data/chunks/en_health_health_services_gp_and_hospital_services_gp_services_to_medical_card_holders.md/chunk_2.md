##  Introduction

With a [ medical card ](/en/health/medical-cards-and-gp-visit-cards/medical-
card/) , you can get many public services for free. With a [ GP visit card
](/en/health/medical-cards-and-gp-visit-cards/gp-visit-cards/) , you can get
free GP visits.

If you have a medical card or GP visit card, your doctor must treat you in the
same way they treat private patients. GPs have a contract with the HSE listing
the services they must provide for medical card and GP visit card holders.
This means that for example, surgery times and access to home visits must be
the same for all patients.

This service is paid for by the Health Service Executive (HSE) through the [
Primary Care Reimbursement Service ](https://www.hse.ie/eng/staff/pcrs/)
(PCRS).
