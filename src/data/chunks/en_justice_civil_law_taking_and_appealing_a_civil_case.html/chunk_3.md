##  Types of civil claim

There are various types of civil claims that you may take to court.

Many civil claims are personal injuries claims that are brought as a result of
road traffic accidents, accidents at work and slipping or tripping and falling
in a shop, on a road or in a public place. It is important to note that you
cannot pursue a personal injuries action through the courts without first
submitting your claim to the [ InjuriesBoard.ie process ](/en/justice/civil-
law/injuries-resolution-board/) .

You may have a claim based on breach of contract or based on a neighbour's
interference with your enjoyment of your property - nuisance claims.

Another type of case is a claim for damages as a result of defamation, that
is, when a personâ€™s reputation is injured as a result of the publication by
any means, orally or in writing, of untruths about the person.

You may have a claim in relation to ownership of land or you may require the
court to sort out [ arrangements in respect of marital breakdown
