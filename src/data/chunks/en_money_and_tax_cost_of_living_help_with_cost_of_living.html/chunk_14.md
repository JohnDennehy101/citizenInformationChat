###  Back to school costs

The [ Back to School Clothing and Footwear Allowance (BTSCFA) ](/en/social-
welfare/families-and-children/back-to-school-clothing-and-footwear-allowance/)
helps you meet the cost of uniforms and footwear for children going to school.
It is paid automatically to some families in July. It is a means-tested
payment. If you did not get the automatic payment already, you can check if
you qualify. You must apply before the end of September.

It was announced in [ Budget 2024 ](/en/money-and-tax/budgets/budget-2024/)
that free schoolbooks will be provided to Junior Cycle students from September
2024.
