###  **Calculating your additional income**

You work out your additional income using the formula: (A+B) – C, or the value
of A, whichever is the smallest amount.

  * A: income from employment, prescribed employment or training schemes, Working Family Payment, and maintenance payments of over €95.23 a week (do not include child maintenance payments). 
  * B: assessable weekly income from all other sources 
  * C: SWA rate for family circumstances 

You subtract PRSI, pension contributions, and Revenue-approved income
continuance payments from your additional income figure.

You then subtract €75, and get 25% of the remaining figure.

Add €75 and 25% of the subtotal together – this is your _additional income
disregard._

**For example:** Mary has 1 child aged 5. She works and earns €385 weekly in a
part-time job. She gets a One-Parent Family (OFP) payment of €175.50 a week
and maintenance of €80 a week. Her additional income is:  A= €385 (Earnings)
B= €175.50 (OFP including Increase for a Qualified Child)  C= €276 (SWA rate)
(A+B) – C= €284.50  Subtract PRSI of €8.90  (PRSI: 4% of €385=€15.40 minus
