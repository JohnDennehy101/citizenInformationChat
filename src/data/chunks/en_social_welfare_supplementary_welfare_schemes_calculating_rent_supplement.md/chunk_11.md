##  Step 2: Find out what your income in excess of the SWA rate is

The basic Supplementary Welfare Allowance (SWA) rate is €230. You will get a
higher rate if you have dependants (such as a spouse or child). Read more
about the [ rates of SWA for dependants
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/supplementary-welfare-
schemes/supplementary-welfare-allow/#4b2ee5) .

To find out how much of your income is ‘in excess of the SWA rate’, you deduct
the following from your gross assessable weekly income:

  * First, deduct any PRSI that you pay and any reasonable travel expenses related to work. Your travel costs will vary depending on where you live and work (ask [ your local Intreo Centre ](https://www.gov.ie/en/directory/category/e1f4b5-intreo-offices/) for more information). 
  * Then deduct the basic Supplementary Welfare Allowance (SWA) Rate, appropriate to your family circumstances. If you are a carer or aged 65 and over, there are additional disregards – see below.
