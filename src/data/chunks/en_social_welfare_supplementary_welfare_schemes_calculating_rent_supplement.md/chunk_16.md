###  **How maintenance is assessed**

Maintenance is assessed as additional income and maintenance payments up to
€95.23 per week are assessed in full (however, child maintenance payments are
not taken into account).

The first €95.23 per week of maintenance payments are considered to be a
contribution towards your housing expenses. The additional income disregard
applies to maintenance payments above this amount.

  * If you are getting maintenance under €95.23 or child maintenance of any amount, do not include it in this step. 
  * If your maintenance is over €95.23, you should subtract €95.23 and include the excess maintenance when working out your additional income disregard.
