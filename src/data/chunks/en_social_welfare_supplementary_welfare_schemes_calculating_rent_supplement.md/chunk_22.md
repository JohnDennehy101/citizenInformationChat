##  Step 6: Find your Rent Supplement payment

To calculate your Rent Supplement, you subtract your 'total contribution to
rent' from your weekly rent.

In Step 5, you found your 'total contribution to your rent'. Now you need to
find out how much your weekly rent is. You may already know how much your
weekly rent is. If you pay your rent by month, you must multiply your monthly
rent figure by 12 and divide it by 52 to get your weekly rent figure. Your
rent must not be above the maximum limit set for your area.

**For example** Susan and Paul are living in Dublin and paying €1,000 per
month for accommodation.  To get the weekly rent figure, multiply €1,000 by 12
and divide by 52.  Monthly rent €1,000  (Multiply by 12 months ) x 12 =
€12,000 a year  (Divide by 52 weeks) ÷ 52 = €230.76 a week  Weekly rent is
€230.76

A maximum rent level is [ set for each county by the Department of Social
Protection ](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/79fdae-maximum-rent-limits/) .
The Department may set lower rates within these limits. If your actual rent is
higher than the local maximum, you may be refused Rent Supplement.

The DSP can make additional Rent Supplement payments above rent limits when
necessary. This is done on a case-by-case basis, both for people already
getting Rent Supplement and for new applicants.
