##  Step 1: Calculate your gross assessable weekly income from all sources

You should include all income that you and your spouse, partner, or cohabitant
have, such as:

  * Social welfare payments, including the Working Family Payment 
  * Employment or training schemes 
  * Gross income from employment or self-employment 
  * Income from maintenance (except child maintenance, as this is not included in the assessment) 
  * Any means you have from ‘capital’ (see below). 

Since January 2012, income from working as a home help with the HSE is taken
into account.
