###  **Minimum household contribution**

In general, a household (this is the claimant and may also include a qualified
adult and qualified children) must contribute at least €30 towards rent. A
couple contributes at least €40.

A non-dependent household member who is solely dependent on a personal social
welfare payment must also contribute at least €30. However, if [ benefit and
privilege ](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/means-test-for-
social-welfare-payments/how-parents-income-can-affect-supplementary-welfare-
allowance/) has been assessed against your social welfare payment you will not
have to contribute €30.

The CWO can reduce the amount of Rent Supplement payable by an amount which,
in their opinion, is payable by each non-dependent household member in
employment. According to custom and practice, the assessable income of the
non-dependent household member (that is, gross income less PRSI and travel
costs to work) is divided by the appropriate rate of SWA for their situation
which is then multiplied by €30 to establish their liability to contribute.

**For example:** If your 26 year-old daughter is living with you and earning
€700 per week:  €700 ÷ €230 (SWA) = €3.04  Multiply €3.04 by €30 = €91.20  In
this case, your Rent Supplement is reduced by €91.20

A couple aged over 65 with an income equal or less than the State Pension
(Contributory) for their situation will contribute €40 towards their rent. A
couple who both have State Pensions (Contributory) and no other income will
also contribute €40 towards their rent.
