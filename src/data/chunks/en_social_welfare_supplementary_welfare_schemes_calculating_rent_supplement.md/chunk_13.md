####  **Example of the over-65 disregard**

For example, the over-65 disregard for a person aged 65 or over would be the
maximum State Pension (Contributory) rate (€277.30) minus the SWA rate for a
single person (€230), which is €47.30.

The over-65 disregard for a couple, who are both aged 66 and getting separate
payments or working, would be calculated using the maximum State Pension
(Contributory) rate for 2 people minus the basic SWA rate for a couple
(€554.60 - €384 = €170.60). Their over-65 disregard would be €170.60.
