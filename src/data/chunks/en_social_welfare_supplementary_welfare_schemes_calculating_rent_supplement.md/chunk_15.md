##  Step 3: Calculate the ‘additional income disregard’ or Disability
Allowance or Blind Pension earnings disregard

The 'additional income disregard' is a certain amount of your household income
that is not taken into account.

The first €75 of any additional household income above the SWA rate for your
circumstances is not taken into account.

Also, 25% of your additional household income over €75 is not taken into
account. There is no upper limit on the 25% that can be disregarded.

Additional income includes income from the following:

  * Part-time employment or part-time self-employment (under 30 hours per week) 
  * Full-time employment or full-time self-employment (30 hours or over per week) where you are accepted as being in need of accommodation under the Rental Accommodation Scheme 
  * Training schemes provided on behalf of the Department of Education and (for example, Youthreach) and Education and Training Board (ETB) training 
  * Back to Work Enterprise Allowance 
  * Rural Social Scheme 
  * TÚS 
  * The Part-time Job Incentive Scheme 
  * Community Employment 
  * Skillnets 
  * Gateway Scheme 
  * Working Family Payment 
  * Maintenance over €95.23 (see below)
