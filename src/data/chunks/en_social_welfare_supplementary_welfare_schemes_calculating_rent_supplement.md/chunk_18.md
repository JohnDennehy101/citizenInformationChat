###  **Disability Allowance or Blind Pension earnings disregard**

If you are getting Disability Allowance or Blind Pension and work, up to â‚¬165
per week of your earnings from work is not taken into account.

If you are working and getting Disability Allowance or Blind Pension, you can
either use this earnings disregard or the additional income disregard (but not
both). Use whichever is in your best interest.
