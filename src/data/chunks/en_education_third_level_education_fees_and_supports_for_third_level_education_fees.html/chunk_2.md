##  Do I have to pay tuition fees?

Most undergraduate students attending publicly funded third-level courses do
not have to pay tuition fees. Under the terms of the [ Free Fees Initiative
](http://www.studentfinance.ie/mp9377/course-fees/index.html) , the Department
of Further and Higher Education pays the fees to the colleges instead.

A separate annual charge is payable to colleges for the costs of student
services and examinations (see ‘Student contribution’ below).

Charges for Post-Leaving Certificate courses (PLCs) operate under different
rules. You can read about [ Post-Leaving Certificate courses

courses/) .
