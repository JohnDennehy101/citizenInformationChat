###  Defined benefit and defined contribution

In a **defined contribution** scheme, the pension contributions you make are
set and the benefits you get depend on the amount of the contributions you
make.

In a **defined benefit** scheme, the benefit you are entitled to is set in
advance. It could, for example, be linked to your length of service.

Occupational pension schemes can offer aspects of both defined benefit and
defined contribution schemes. These are known as **hybrid** schemes. This
means that you can predict a certain amount of income, as in a defined benefit
scheme, and the remainder may vary as it will be subject to defined
contribution rules.
