##  Introduction

An occupational pension is a pension provided by your employer. They are also
known as company or employersâ€™ pension plans. Occupational pension schemes
provide a regular income after retirement. Some also give you a lump sum
payment when you retire.

There is no legal obligation on employers to provide occupational pension
schemes for employees. In general, large employers in Ireland have
occupational pension schemes, but many smaller employers do not.

If your employer does not have an occupational pension scheme, they must give
you access to a type of pension plan called a [ Personal Retirement Savings
Account (PRSA) ](/en/money-and-tax/personal-finance/pensions/personal-
retirement-savings-accounts/) .

Each pension scheme has its own set of rules. Pension schemes are generally
regulated by the Pensions Authority. Members of schemes have certain rights,
for example, to information about their pension.
