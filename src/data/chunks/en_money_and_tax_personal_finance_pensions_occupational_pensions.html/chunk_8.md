##  Defined benefit schemes

A defined benefit scheme is where the benefit entitlement you get when you
retire is defined by reference to your earnings, your length of service, an
index, or a fixed amount. This means that you know in advance that your
pension will be, for example, half of your final salary if you have 40 yearsâ€™
service or that it will be a certain amount each week. In defined benefit
schemes, the contributions may have to be varied from time to time to make
sure that the fund can meet the level of benefits. Some schemes allow the
employer to top up the fund if necessary.
