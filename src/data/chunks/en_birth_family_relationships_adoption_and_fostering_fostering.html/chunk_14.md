##  Allowances

Tusla pays a basic maintenance allowance to foster parents and families. The
agency also offers support structures to assist the child, carer and family
during the fostering term, including:

  * Training for the foster carer or family 
  * Ongoing liaison with social workers 
  * Insurance 
  * A medical card for the child in care 

From 1 January 2024, the Foster Care Allowance payable for children in foster
care placements is as follows:

Age of child  |  Weekly rate   
---|---  
Under 12 years  |  €350 per child   
12 years and over  |  €377 per child   
  
An allowance may be paid between the ages of 18 and 21 to young people leaving
care who are still in training or education. In certain circumstances, support
may continue for a further 2 years if the person is on a clear education or
training pathway.

This allowance is known as a Standardised Aftercare Allowance. A range of
other supports is available to all young people leaving care, whether they are
in education or not. You can find more information on [ Financial Support in
Aftercare (pdf)
