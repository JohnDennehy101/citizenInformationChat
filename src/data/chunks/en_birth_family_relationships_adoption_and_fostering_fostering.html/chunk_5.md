##  Placing a child in foster care

Children can be placed in foster care in 2 ways:

  * Voluntarily: When a parent or family asks Tusla for help, and/or 
  * Court order: When a judge decides that it is in the best interests of the child to be placed in the care of Tusla. 

When a child is placed in foster care, Tusla assigns responsibility for the
child to a social worker. Based on the child's needs and circumstances, Tusla
makes a decision on the type of fostering that is most suitable for the child.
