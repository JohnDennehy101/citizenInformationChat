###  Retaining medical card

If you are unemployed and you are returning to full-time or part-time work,
you can keep your medical card for 3 years provided you have been getting one
of the following for 12 months or more:

  * [ Jobseeker's Benefit ](/en/social-welfare/unemployed-people/jobseekers-benefit/)
  * [ Jobseeker's Allowance ](/en/social-welfare/unemployed-people/jobseekers-allowance/)
  * [ One-Parent Family Payment ](/en/social-welfare/families-and-children/one-parent-family-payment/)
  * [ Illness Benefit ](/en/social-welfare/disability-and-illness/disablement-benefit/)
  * [ Disability Allowance ](/en/social-welfare/disability-and-illness/disability-allowance/)
  * [ Blind Pension ](/en/social-welfare/disability-and-illness/blind-persons-pension/) or 
  * Have been on an employment incentive scheme or educational opportunity scheme 

If you take up full-time employment you will retain your medical card for 3
years from the date you start work. If you take up part-time employment the
three-year period starts from the date your income exceeds the relevant
medical card guideline.
