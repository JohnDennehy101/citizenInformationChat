###  Getting social welfare payments

In certain circumstances, you are allowed to keep social welfare payments (or
at least part of them) when you start work. For example:

If you work part-time up to 3 days per week you may be entitled to retain part
of your [ Jobseeker's Benefit ](/en/social-welfare/unemployed-
people/jobseekers-benefit/) or [ Jobseeker's Allowance ](/en/social-
welfare/unemployed-people/jobseekers-allowance/) . If you are getting [ One-
Parent Family Payment ](/en/social-welfare/families-and-children/one-parent-
family-payment/) you are allowed to earn a certain amount each week and keep
your payment. If you are getting a means-tested disability payment, such as
Disability Allowance or Blind Pension, you may [ earn a certain amount from
work ](/en/social-welfare/social-welfare-payments-and-work/disability-
payments-and-work/) without it affecting your payment. If you are getting
Illness Benefit (for at least 6 months) or Invalidity Pension you can apply
for [ Partial Capacity Benefit ](/en/social-welfare/disability-and-
illness/partial-capacity-benefit/) and keep part of your payment, depending on
how restricted your capacity for work is.
