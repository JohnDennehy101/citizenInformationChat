####  Baby conceived before 4 May 2020

If the baby was conceived **before** 4 May 2020, the birth must first be
registered as a non-DAHR birth. After the birth has been registered, a court
order naming another person as the parent of the child (a Declaration of
Parentage) is required prior to the re-registration of the birth. Find out [
how to apply for a Declaration of Parentage ](https://www.courts.ie/paternity-
and-declaration-parentage) on the Courts Service website.

If the DAHR procedure satisfies the requirements of the 2015 Act, the parents
can then [ apply to re-register the birth
