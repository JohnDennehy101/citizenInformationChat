##  When to register a birth

You must register the birth of your baby within 3 months of their birth.
However, you have up to 12 months to register the birth in some circumstances.
If you need to register a birth after 12 months, contact the [ Civil
Registration Service ](https://www2.hse.ie/services/births-deaths-and-
marriages/find-a-civil-registration-service/) for advice.

If a birth is registered within 3 months, the information will be
automatically sent to the Department of Social Protection, and Child Benefit
forms and a PPS number will be sent automatically to the qualified informant,
usually the parent(s).

If you register your babyâ€™s birth after 3 months, you will have to contact
Client Identity Services and the Department of Social Protection to arrange
the PPS number and Child Benefit.

If you had a hospital birth, you should wait 3 weeks after the birth before
booking an appointment to register the birth (for a hospital birth only). If
your baby was born at home, you can book an appointment at any time.
