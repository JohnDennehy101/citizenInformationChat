###  Unmarried parents (registering the birth for the first time)

There are different options for registering the birth of a child where the
parents are not married. From 12 August 2024, [ some parents can do this
online ](https://civilregistration.mywelfare.ie/WhoCanRegister) .

If you register the birth of your child at a Civil Registration Service, you
can get the different forms from the Registrar's office. The options are:

  * Both the mother and father can jointly request the registration (Form CRA 9). Both attend the Registrar's office together and sign the register jointly. 
  * The mother can complete a declaration form naming the father (Form CRA 1) and bring it, along with a declaration by the baby's father acknowledging that he is the father of the child (Form CRA 3). The mother signs the register. 
  * The father can complete a declaration form acknowledging that he is the father of the child (Form CRA 2), and can go to the Registrar's office himself, bringing with him a declaration by the mother naming the father (Form CRA 4). The father signs the register. 
  * The mother or father can make a written request (Form CRA 5 and Form CRA 6 respectively) on production of a _certified copy of a court order_ , which names the person to be registered as the father. The parent making the request will be required to attend at the office of the Registrar to sign the Register of Births. 

It is also possible to enter the father's details if the mother is (or was)
married to someone else. As well as a sworn declaration from the father
stating he is the father, one of the following is required:

  * A sworn declaration by the mother's husband stating he is not the father, or 
  * A sworn declaration by the mother stating she has been living apart from her husband for more than 10 months before the birth of the child and a deed of separation/decree of divorce (not all foreign divorces are recognised under Irish law), or 
  * A certified copy of a court order which names the person to be registered as the father

If the parents of a child are not married to each other, there is no
presumption in law as to who the father of the child is, unless the father's
name is on the birth certificate. However, having the father's name on the
childâ€™s birth certificate does not give the father any legal rights in respect
of their child. You can read more about [ Legal guardianship and cohabiting
couples ](/en/birth-family-relationships/cohabiting-couples/guardianship-and-
