##  When your baby is born

A Birth Notification Form (Form BNF/01) is usually completed with the
parent(s) by hospital staff (in the case of hospital births), or by a doctor
or midwife (in home births), to guarantee that accurate information is
recorded.

The Birth Notification Form outlines the information to be recorded in the
Register of Births. If your child is born in hospital, the form is sent to the
Registrar's office, letting the Registrar know that a birth has occurred.

If your child was born at home with the support of a healthcare professional,
they should give you the signed Birth Notification Form. It must include their
registration and PIN. Bring this with you to your appointment to register your
child's birth.
