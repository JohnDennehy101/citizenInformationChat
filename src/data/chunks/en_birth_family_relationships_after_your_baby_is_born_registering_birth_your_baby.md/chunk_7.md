###  Married parents

If the parents are in a recognised marriage to each other, only one parent
needs to register the birth. From 12 August 2024, [ some parents may be
invited to register online
](https://civilregistration.mywelfare.ie/WhoCanRegister) . One or both of you
can attend the Civil Registration Service (if you both want to sign the
register). If you were married in another country, you should bring the
original marriage certificate (and a translation, if required).
