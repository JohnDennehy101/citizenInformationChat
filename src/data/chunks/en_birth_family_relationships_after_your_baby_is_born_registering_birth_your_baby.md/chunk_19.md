###  Changing a child’s forename (first name)

Parents can apply to have their child’s forename registered, added or changed.
There is a fee of €5 for the insertion or alteration of a child's forename.

Contact your local [ Civil Registration Office
](https://www2.hse.ie/services/births-deaths-and-marriages/find-a-civil-
registration-service/) to discuss your request to add or change the child's
forename.

  1. You will need to complete and sign a CRA 16 form. This form will be provided by the Civil Registration Office 
  2. You will need original documentary evidence in support of the amendment, that is, proof that the child is using the forename(s), as you want them to read on the birth entry in the Register of Births, going as far back as possible. 

Examples of documentary evidence can include:

  * Church records (baptismal certificate/naming ceremony certificate) 
  * School or crèche records 
  * Public health records, hospital, GP records 
  * Passport, driver's licence, PPS Card, other government records 

If you have any original birth certificates they may be submitted with the
application for exchange.

The CRA 16 form must be signed by both parents.

  * If one parent is deceased the death certificate must be provided 
  * If the mother’s name only appears on the birth entry then only the mother needs to sign the CRA 16 form 
  * If both parents are deceased, contact the [ General Register Office ](https://www.gov.ie/en/campaigns/af7893-general-register-office/) , Government Offices, Convent Road, Roscommon, Co Roscommon to request the required form
