##  Introduction

The HSE's [ Civil Registration Service ](https://www2.hse.ie/services/births-
deaths-and-marriages/find-a-civil-registration-service/) registers all births,
deaths and marriages in Ireland.

Once the birth is registered, your baby will be given a [ PPS number
](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/personal-public-service-
number/) and you can [ get a birth certificate ](/en/birth-family-
relationships/getting-birth-marriage-or-death-certificate/) (which you will
need to [ enrol your child in school ](/en/education/primary-and-post-primary-
education/going-to-primary-school/starting-primary-school/) , to [ apply for a
passport ](/en/travel-and-recreation/passports/applying-for-or-renewing-an-
irish-passport/) and for many other purposes).

You must register the birth of your child within 3 months of their birth,
where possible. However, you have up to 12 months to register the birth in
some circumstances. If you need to register a birth after 12 months, contact
the [ Civil Registration Service ](https://www2.hse.ie/services/births-deaths-
and-marriages/find-a-civil-registration-service/) for advice.
