###  If the parents cannot register the birth

Where the parents do not register the birth, or it is not possible for them to
do it, the following people can also act as _qualified informants_ :

  * A designated member of the staff of the hospital (or other institution, organisation or enterprise) where the birth took place 
  * Any person present at the birth 
  * Any person present in the dwelling where the birth occurred 
  * Any person who has charge of the child 
  * A person appointed guardian of the child 
  * A person found to be the parent of the child by order of the courts
