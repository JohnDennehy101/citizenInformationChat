##  Re-registration of a birth to include name of the father

A birth can be re-registered to include the name of the father if any of the
following situations apply:

  * The parents of a child are not married to each other but wish to have the father's details included and these details were not registered initially. 
  * The parents of a child marry each other after the birth of the child. 

Contact a [ Civil Registration Service ](https://www2.hse.ie/services/births-
deaths-and-marriages/find-a-civil-registration-service/) to make an
appointment to re-register the birth and find out what documentation you need
to bring with you.
