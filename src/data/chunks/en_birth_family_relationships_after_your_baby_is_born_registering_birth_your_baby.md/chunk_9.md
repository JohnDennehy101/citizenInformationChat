###  Parents of a donor-conceived child

From 5 May 2020, the birth mother and the other parent (the mother's spouse,
civil partner or cohabitant) of a donor-conceived child – born as a result of
a donor-assisted human reproduction (DAHR) procedure – can register as parents
with the Registrar for Births, Deaths and Marriages, and get a birth
certificate for the child which reflects this. These provisions apply to:

  * Opposite sex couples 
  * Female same-sex couples 
  * Single women undergoing a donor-assisted human reproduction procedure. 

The process of registering the child’s birth will vary depending on the date
the baby was conceived (not the date the child is born).
