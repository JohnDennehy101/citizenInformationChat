###  Face coverings

It is no longer mandatory to wear a face-mask in any indoor setting.

You may be asked to wear a face mask when visiting some health and care
settings. The healthcare staff will let you know if you need to. If you have
symptoms of COVID-19, cold or flu, it may not be safe to visit a health or
care setting. Contact them for advice before visiting.
