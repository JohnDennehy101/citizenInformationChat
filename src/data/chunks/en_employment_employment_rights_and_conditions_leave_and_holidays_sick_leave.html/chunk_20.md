###  **Sick leave that continues into a new calendar year**

You cannot continue a period of statutory sick leave from one calendar year
into the next.

If you are getting Illness Benefit at end of the calendar year, then you
cannot use the new yearâ€™s statutory sick days during that period of sick
leave. You should continue on Illness Benefit in this scenario.

If you are on statutory sick leave at the end of a calendar year, you should
move onto illness benefit if you remain unfit to work. However, if you return
to work at any time in the following calendar year, you will have full access
to your statutory sick leave entitlement for that year.
