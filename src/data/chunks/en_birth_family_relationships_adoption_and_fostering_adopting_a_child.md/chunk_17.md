##  Rights of the birth parents

Before a child can be adopted, the birth mother (or any other legal guardian)
must give **written consent** using an official consent form. They must
consent ( _agree_ ) to:

  * Placing the child for adoption by Tusla or an approved adoption service 
  * The making of an adoption order 

The birth mother (or guardian) can only give consent after they have had
counselling. This is to make sure that they are giving consent in a free and
informed manner. The social worker must be satisfied that the birth mother (or
guardian) understands the legal and personal implications of adoption.

The birth mother (or guardian) has a right to know the religion of the
prospective adoptive parents before they give consent.
