##  Laws on adoption and the organisations involved

The Adoption Act 2010 merged, consolidated and updated all existing adoption
laws in Ireland. This Act was revised further by the Adoption (Amendment) Act
2017. Read about these key pieces of legislation in the table below:

**The law:** |  **Some key points:**  
---|---  
[ Adoption Act 2010 ](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2010/en/act/pub/0021/index.html) |  This law: Established the [ Adoption Authority of Ireland ](http://www.aai.gov.ie/) – read about ‘Organisations involved in adoption’ below States that a child must be at least 6 weeks old before they can be placed for adoption Sets out the eligibility criteria for adoptive parents, and states the need for applicants to get a ‘Declaration of Eligibility and Suitability’ (which is like a ‘license to adopt’).   
[ Adoption (Amendment) Act 2017 ](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2017/act/19/enacted/en/html) |  This law updated some rules in relation to adoption, for example: All children are now considered equal in terms of their eligibility for adoption. Children born to married parents can be placed for adoption, and children who were previously adopted can be adopted again. The best interests of the child are the most important consideration in any adoption application. When placing a child for adoption, the High Court can ‘ _dispense_ ’ (ignore) the need for the parental consent if the parents have failed in their duty towards the child for 36 months or more, and where adoption is considered to be in the child’s best interest
