###  Relevant non-guardians

Relevant non-guardians have a right to be consulted about an adoption. A
_relevant non-guardian_ is a person who is recognised as the parent of a
child, but who is not a legal guardian. A relevant non-guardian may also be a
type of guardian who does not have the right to consent to an adoption.

If you are a relevant non-guardian and you are concerned that your child may
be placed for adoption without your knowledge, you can [ register your details
with the Adoption Authority of Ireland (pdf)
](http://aai.gov.ie/images/download/Form-F3-Natural-Father-Register-Form.pdf)
. They will check the register against all applications for adoption.
