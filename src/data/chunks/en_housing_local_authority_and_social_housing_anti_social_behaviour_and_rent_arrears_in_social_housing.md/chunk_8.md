##  What should I do if I can’t pay the rent?

If you can’t pay the rent for your local authority housing, you should talk to
your local authority immediately to discuss the arrears. They will work with
you to try find a solution. They can:

  * Reduce your rent if your income decreases, or your circumstances change. For example, if you lose your job, or an adult in the household moves out. 
  * Agree a repayment plan with you. This means you will pay off a certain amount of the rent arrears each week in addition to your normal weekly rent. 
  * Provide support for you to stay in your home through a tenancy sustainment programme. This programme is aimed at people in rent arrears. 
  * Reduce your rent if there is a particular reason to do so. For example, the local authority can reduce your rent if your household is badly affected by exceptional social factors that make it difficult for the house to function or to pay the rent, or if it would cause undue hardship for your household to pay the full rent. This reduction in rent is provided under a hardship clause. 

If you don’t arrange to pay off the arrears, you could end up [ losing your
