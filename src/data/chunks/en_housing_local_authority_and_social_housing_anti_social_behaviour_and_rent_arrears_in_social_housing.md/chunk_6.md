##  Who do I contact about anti-social behaviour in social housing?

If you are a local authority tenant who is affected by anti-social behaviour,
contact your [ local authority
](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/942f74-local-authorities/) .

If you are the tenant of an approved housing body, you should contact the [
approved housing body ](/en/housing/local-authority-and-social-
housing/approved-housing-bodies/) .

You can also contact the Garda Síochána to report the behaviour.

There is useful information on our website about [ neighbour disputes
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/justice/neighbour_disputes/) .
