##  What happens if I don’t pay my rent arrears?

Local authorities are used to dealing with rent arrears issues, so if you fall
behind with your payments you should contact them immediately to try and come
to a solution. If you don’t contact your local authority about your arrears,
they may start the process to evict you.

The local authority cannot evict you unless the District Court feels it is
reasonable to do so in the circumstances. The local authority must send you a
tenancy warning notice about the rent arrears before it begins the process.
You can ask for a review of the tenancy warning. If you don’t pay the rent
arrears or arrange a repayment plan, the local authority can begin the process
of taking your home.

If you are in rent arrears, you may be unable to:

  * [ Transfer to another local authority home ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/housing/local-authority-and-social-housing/getting-a-transfer-to-another-local-authority-home/)
  * Get your local authority to do maintenance on your home, apart from emergency maintenance 

If you are evicted for rent arrears, you may not be accepted on any [ local
authority housing list ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/housing/local-
authority-and-social-housing/social-housing-waiting-lists/) again.
