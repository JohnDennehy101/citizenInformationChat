##  Statutory Sick Pay and Illness Benefit

From 1 Jan 2024, [ Statutory Sick Pay (SSP) increased
](/en/employment/employment-rights-and-conditions/leave-and-holidays/sick-
leave-and-sick-pay/) from 3 to 5 days a year. You cannot get Illness Benefit
on the days that you get SSP.

If your first illness in 2024 is less than 5 days and you qualify for
Statutory Sick Pay, you don't need to apply for Illness Benefit. For illnesses
lasting more than 5 days, Illness Benefit starts from day 6.

If you use your 5 days of SSP in 2024 and you become ill again in the same
year, you'll get Illness Benefit from day 4 of your illness, which is after
the normal 3 waiting days.

leave-in-2024/#examples) on gov.ie.
