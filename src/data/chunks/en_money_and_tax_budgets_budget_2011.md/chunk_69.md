###  Education for Travellers

Senior Traveller Training Centres (STTCs) will be phased out by June 2012.
Replacement further education places, prioritised for Travellers, will be
provided under the Back to Education Initiative (BTEI). This means that there
will be no new enrolments in STTCs from 1 January 2011.
