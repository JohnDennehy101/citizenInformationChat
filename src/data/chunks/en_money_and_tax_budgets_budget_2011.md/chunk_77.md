###  Disability and mental health

There will be a maximum reduction of 1.8% in the Budget allocation for the two
sectors.

An additional €10 million funding will be provided to the HSE for disability
in 2011. This is to meet anticipated extra demand for emergency residential,
respite and personal assistant/home support hours for people with disabilities
and day places for school leavers in September 2011.

An additional €1m has been provided for suicide prevention. The National
Office for Suicide Prevention (NOSP) will target:

  * Development of the number and range of training and awareness programmes 
  * Improvements and standardised responses to deliberate self harm 
  * Development of the capacity of primary care to respond to suicidal behaviour and consider new models of response 
  * Ensuring that helpline supports for those in emotional distress are coordinated and widely publicised
