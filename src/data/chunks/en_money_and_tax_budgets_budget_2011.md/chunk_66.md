###  Student charges

The Student Services Charge for third-level students is replaced by a flat-
rate higher education student contribution of €2,000 per year. Arrangements
will be made to provide that second and subsequent siblings from a single
family will not have to bear the full increased cost of the new €2,000 charge.

It is intended that this contribution will be payable in two instalments.
Students qualifying for third-level grants will not have to pay it.

A new charge of €200 per year is introduced for Post-Leaving Certificate (PLC)
students. Students qualifying for maintenance grants will not have to pay this
charge.
