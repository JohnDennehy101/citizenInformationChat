##  Introduction

The main Budget changes which may affect people living in Ireland are set out
below.

This document sets out changes in the areas of social welfare, tax, health,
transport, environment, housing, education, employment and other areas. It is
an overview and not a complete statement of the measures announced in Budget
2011\. **The document will be expanded and updated as information becomes
available** .

Some of the changes announced in the Budget come into effect immediately.
Others take effect from the beginning of January 2011. Many others have to be
finalised before coming into effect. Some elements of these measures may
change when the Finance Bill is published – this is expected in early 2011.

For a full list of the Budget changes, please read the Department of Finance’s
[ Summary of Budget Measures ](http://www.budget.gov.ie) .
