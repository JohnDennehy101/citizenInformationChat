###  Relevant Contracts Tax

Relevant Contracts Tax applies to contractors in the construction, meat-
processing and forestry sectors of the economy. To foster compliance, a new
withholding rate of 20% will apply to subcontractors registered for tax with
an established compliance record, with the existing 35% rate retained for
subcontractors not registered for tax.
