##  Being refused permission to enter Ireland

The immigration officer may refuse your permission to enter Ireland if the
immigration officer believes:

  * You are not in a position to support yourself and any dependants arriving with you 
  * You intend to take up employment and you do not have a permit 
  * You suffer from certain specified conditions - these include TB, other infectious diseases, drug addiction and profound mental disturbance (this is defined as “manifest conditions of psychotic disturbance with agitation, delirium, hallucinations or confusion”) 
  * You have been convicted of an offence which carries a penalty of a year’s imprisonment or more 
  * You are obliged to have a visa and you do not have one 
  * You are the subject of a deportation order, an exclusion order or similar order 
  * You do not have a valid passport 
  * You intend to travel to Great Britain or Northern Ireland and you do not have a right to enter there 
  * Your entry or presence in Ireland could pose a threat to national security or be contrary to public policy 
  * You have come to Ireland for a different reason than you have given the immigration officer 

If you are refused permission to enter you must be given the reasons in
writing.
