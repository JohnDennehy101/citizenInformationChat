###  What happens if I don’t pay my fine?

If your fine remains unpaid or if you do not pay an instalment by the due
date, you should get a fines enforcement notice.

The fines enforcement notice will tell you the date and time you must attend
for another hearing and you will need to provide a written statement of your
financial circumstances.

At that hearing, you will be given an opportunity to pay the outstanding fine
in full or the judge may opt for one of the following (in order):

  * Attachment of earnings - your employer will deduct a specified sum from your pay 
  * Recovery order – only for fines over €500 or corporate fines 
  * Community service 
  * Imprisonment
