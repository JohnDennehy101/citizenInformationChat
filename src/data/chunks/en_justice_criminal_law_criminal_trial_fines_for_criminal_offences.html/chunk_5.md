###  Maximum fines enacted before 2011

If the maximum fine was set before January 2011, it will now fit into one of
the fine classes. The fine class it belongs to depends on when the fine was
set and the amount the maximum fine was set at.

For example, if legislation (an act or statutory instrument) set the maximum
fine on summary conviction for a particular offence at the equivalent of €500
in 1992, a class D fine now applies. See table below. fence at the equivalent
of €500 in 1992, a class D fine now applies. See table below.
