##  Making a complaint

Complaints about solicitors and barristers are dealt with by the LSRA. The
LSRA complaint handling system replaces the previous complaints handling
service provided by the Law Society and the Bar Council of Ireland.

You can make a complaint to the LSRA if you have received a poor legal
service, been charged too much or you believe the legal professional is guilty
of professional misconduct.

Professional misconduct is unethical or unprofessional behaviour that falls
short of the ethical or professional standards accepted by a particular
profession. Examples include dishonesty, taking advantage of your age or
inexperience, acting against your instructions or using insulting, racist or
sexist language.

When the complaint is received the LSRA will notify the legal practitioner
(and the Law Society of Ireland if appropriate). You can read about how to
make a complaint and what you can expect on [ the LSRA website
](https://www.lsra.ie/make-a-complaint/) .
