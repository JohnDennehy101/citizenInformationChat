###  Development and zoning of land

You are considered to be lobbying if you make a relevant communication about
the development or zoning of land under the Planning and Development Acts 2000
to 2014.

A communication about obtaining planning permission to build or extend your
principal private residence is considered an excepted communication and
therefore not lobbying. Under the legislation, your principal private
residence is a dwelling occupied by you as your main residence. It includes up
to 1 acre of land exclusive of your dwelling that you have for your own
occupation and enjoyment.

Making your views known to a local authority is not considered to be lobbying
if it is:

  * Part of a formal public consultation process about a development or local area plan 
  * A proposal to zone or re-zone particular lands 
  * Applications for planning permission and submissions in relation to an application for planning permission 

However, if you communicate with a designated public official outside the
formal public consultation or application process you may have to register
your lobbying activity.

You can find more information in the Commissionâ€™s [ Guidelines on lobbying in
relation to development and zoning of land. ](https://www.lobbying.ie/help-
resources/information-for-lobbyists/guidelines-in-relation-to-development-and-
zoning-of-land/)
