##  Introduction

In Ireland, to be legally entitled to marry, both of you must:

  * Have the [ capacity to marry ](/en/birth-family-relationships/getting-married/legal-requirements-for-marriage/) each other 
  * Freely consent to the marriage 
  * Observe the [ marriage notification process ](/en/birth-family-relationships/getting-married/notification-requirements-for-marriage/) required by law. 

You can get married in a [ civil ceremony, a religious ceremony, or a secular
ceremony ](/en/birth-family-relationships/getting-married/different-legal-
ways-of-getting-married/) and each is equally valid and binding under Irish
law. For a marriage to be legal, the ceremony must be performed by a
solemniser. _Solemniser_ is the term used for people licensed by the State to
conduct weddings.
