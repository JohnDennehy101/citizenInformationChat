###  Marriage ceremony

While the marriage ceremony can be performed according to the customs and
rites of the religious or secular body, as part of the ceremony you and your
intended spouse must make 2 declarations:

  * That you do not know of any reason you should not marry (impediment to the marriage) 
  * That you accept each other as husband/wife/spouse
