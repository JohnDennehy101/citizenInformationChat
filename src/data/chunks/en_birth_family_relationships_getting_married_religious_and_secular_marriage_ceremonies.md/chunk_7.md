###  Register of Solemnisers

Anyone solemnising a marriage must be on the [ Register of Solemnisers
](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/077ce8-register-of-
solemnisers/?referrer=https://www.welfare.ie/en/downloads/RegisterOfSolemnisers)
which is maintained and updated by the [ General Register Office
](https://www.gov.ie/en/campaigns/af7893-general-register-office/) . It lists
civil registrars and the members of the various religious and secular bodies
who have been nominated by the relevant authorities of those bodies as
solemnisers.

Temporary registrations of solemnisers of religious and secular marriages are
possible for people who only wish to solemnise a specific marriage or to
solemnise marriages for a specific period of time. If a member of a religious
or secular body wishes to be registered as a solemniser they must be nominated
by the appropriate body in Ireland. In general, this will be the head office
of the religious or secular body. Each religious and secular body has a
registered nominator who is responsible for ensuring the details held in the
Register of Solemnisers is accurately recorded by the General Register Office.
For example, in the case of a Roman Catholic priest, it will be the diocesan
office in the diocese in which the marriage is to take place.

Any updates or changes to details in the Register of Solemnisers (including
temporary arrangements) must be notified to the General Register Office by the
nominator of the body.
