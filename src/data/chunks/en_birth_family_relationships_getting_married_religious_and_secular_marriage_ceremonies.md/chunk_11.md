###  Registering the marriage

How you [ register your marriage ](/en/birth-family-relationships/getting-
married/registration-of-marriage/) depends on the type of ceremony you have.
If you marry in a religious or secular ceremony, immediately after the
marriage ceremony, the Marriage Registration Form (MRF) should be signed by
you and your spouse, the 2 witnesses and the person who has solemnised the
marriage. You should return the MRF within one month to a registrar for the
marriage to be registered. It does not have to be returned to the registrar
who issued it. Some [ Civil Registration Services
](https://www2.hse.ie/services/births-deaths-and-marriages/find-a-civil-
registration-service/) have a walk-in service. You need to phone and book an
appointment for others. You will not be able to get your marriage certificate
until you return the MRF to a registrar and the marriage is civilly
registered.
