##  Is there a set retirement age?

In employment law, there is no set age for retirement. However, many employers
may have their own retirement ages. Although 65 is generally the age most
people retire at, many people continue working past this.

Retirement age is not the same as the State Pension age, which is 66.

  * If you are self-employed, there is no set retirement age. 
  * If you are an employee, your retirement age may be set out in your [ contract of employment ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/employment/employment-rights-and-conditions/contracts-of-employment/contract-of-employment/) . 

Some contracts of employment have a _mandatory retirement age_ (that is, the
age at which you must retire). The usual retirement age in a contract of
employment is 65. Many contracts allow for early retirement from age 60, or in
some cases from age 55. Most contracts also allow for early retirement on
health grounds. You can also ask to work longer than your contractual
retirement age.

In some jobs, such as An Garda Síochána and the Defence Forces, there is a
_statutory retirement age_ . This means the retirement age is set out in law.
