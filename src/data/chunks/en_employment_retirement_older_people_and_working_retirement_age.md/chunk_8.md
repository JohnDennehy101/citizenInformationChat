###  **If your request is refused**

If your employer refuses your request, they must meet with you and explain the
specific objective reasons for their decision. You can bring a colleague or
union representative to the meeting.

You should be allowed to discuss and challenge these reasons before a final
decision is made. You should also be able to appeal the final decision. Your
union representative (if you have one) can help with your appeal.
