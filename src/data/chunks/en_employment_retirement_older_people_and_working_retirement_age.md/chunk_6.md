##  Contractual retirement age

Most contracts of employment have a mandatory retirement age (the age at which
you must retire). This is usually 65.

Many employment contracts, allow for early retirement from 60 (or in some
cases, from 55). Most also allow for early retirement on health grounds.

**Can I be forced to retire?**

In some cases, your employer can force you to retire at a certain age. The
employer should discuss the intention for you to retire well in advance of any
proposed retirement date.

Employers can generally only enforce a mandatory retirement age if they can
show:

  * The age at which an employee must retire is clearly stated and applied consistently. 
  * The employer has a valid reason for having this policy, and it is objectively and reasonably justified by a _legitimate aim_ (business need). 
  * The means of achieving the aim are proportionate and necessary. 

Some possible examples of legitimate aims are:

  * Allowing employment opportunities for younger workers 
  * Health and safety concerns, for safety-critical jobs 
  * Addressing age imbalances in the workforce 
  * Succession planning 

In deciding to have a mandatory retirement age, the employer must also
consider if there is a less or non-discriminatory way of achieving the
intended aim or aims.
