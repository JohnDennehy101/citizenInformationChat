##  Can I ask to work beyond my retirement age?

The Workplace Relations Commission (WRC) has a [ code of practice on longer
working (pdf). ](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2017/si/600/made/en/pdf)
The code sets out best practice and guidance in the run up to retirement.

If you want to ask to work beyond retirement age, make your request at least 3
months before the intended retirement date.

This should be followed up with a meeting between you and your employer. Your
employer must tell you their decision as soon as possible.

If they offer you a fixed-term contract it must clearly state, the length of
the contract and the legal grounds.
