##  Litter and The Tidy Towns competition

Litter control is an important part of the national Tidy Towns competition,
which is organised by the [ Department of Rural and Community Development
](https://www.gov.ie/en/organisation/department-of-rural-and-community-
development/) . Towns that take part in the competition are rated on all
aspects of their local environment, including the amount of litter in the
area.

The Tidy Towns competition is launched each year in March or April. Judging
takes place in June, July and August and the results are announced in
September. The Tidy Towns competition is open to every village, town and city
area. If you would like to get involved and help keep your area litter-free,
you should contact your local [ Tidy Towns group
](https://www.tidytowns.ie/get-involved/find-your-local-committee/) .
