###  **Opening hours in Ireland for family doctors (GPs)**

Most GPs work Monday to Friday but their opening hours can vary. A GP that
works in an out-of-hours works during the night and on weekends.

**If your medical issue is not urgent** , you should make an appointment to
see your usual GP during their clinic hours.

**If your medical issue is urgent** and you need to see a GP outside their
clinic hours, you can contact your local GP out-of-hours service. This service
does not provide routine clinic appointments.
