##  Expert witnesses

You can be called as an "expert witness" by either side in a case about
something that is outside the ordinary knowledge of the judge or jury. For
example, you may be called as a handwriting expert or as a doctor to give an
opinion on something that is relevant to the case.

Your opinion is accepted as evidence because you are an expert on the subject
and because the court does not have the knowledge or expertise to form a
reliable opinion on the facts.

If you are called as an expert witness, you must take the oath or affirmation.
You will then be asked to explain why you are an expert in the particular
area, for example, you may outline your qualifications or work experience. You
will then be asked a series of questions that allow you to give your opinion
about certain facts. Finally, you will be cross-examined by the other side.
