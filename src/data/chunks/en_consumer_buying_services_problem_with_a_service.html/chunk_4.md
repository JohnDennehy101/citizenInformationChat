##  If you are not happy with theservice

If things go wrong with the service, it is always the supplier who should put
things right. The supplier must resolve any issue, so the service meets what
was agreed in the contract.

The supplier must correct the issue for free, within a _reasonable_ time and
without significant inconvenience to you. A reasonable time means the shortest
possible time to fix the issue.

If it is not possible or too expensive for the supplier to resolve the issue,
you have the right to either a price reduction or refund. If the issue is
minor, you can only ask for a price reduction.
