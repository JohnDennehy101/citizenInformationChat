##  Where to get more help

You can get more advice if you [ want to make a complaint ](/en/consumer/how-
to-complain/how-to-make-a-complaint/) about a service.

If your complaint cannot be resolved by the supplier of the service, you can
make a formal complaint to the relevant trade or professional body. However,
many suppliers are not members of any trade or professional body.

If you have used the service provider’s complaints procedure and the problem
is still not resolved, you can use the [ small claims procedure
](/en/justice/courts-system/small-claims-court/) (for claims less than €2,000)
or [ taking a civil case
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/justice/civil_law/taking_a_civil_case_intro.en.html)
(for claims over €2,000).

The Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC) can give you more
information on [ your rights if you have problems with a service.
