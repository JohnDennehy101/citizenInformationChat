##  How to pay exam fees

If you are taking the Leaving Certificate in a school setting, your school
will give you a form. You make the payment through a bank and the bank must
stamp the form. You then return the form to the school.

If you, your parent(s) or guardian(s) hold a current [ medical card
](/en/health/medical-cards-and-gp-visit-cards/medical-card/) you do not have
to pay the fee. Put the details of the medical card on the fee payment form
and return the form to the school.

**External students**

If you are an external student (that is, you are sitting your examinations
outside of a school setting), you can either [ apply and pay online
](https://www.examinations.ie/index.php?l=en&mc=ca&sc=ca) or get a form from
the Entries section of the State Examinations Commission (see 'Where to
apply') and pay through a bank.
