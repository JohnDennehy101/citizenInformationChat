###  **Eyesight report form**

Generally, your medical practitioner will report any eyesight issues in the
Driving Licence Medical Report Form.

However, you will need a Driving Licence Eyesight Report Form if you no longer
need glasses or contact lenses to drive (for example, if you've had laser eye
surgery).

You can [ download the eyesight report form (pdf)

(pages 1 and 2 should be printed back to back on one page). It is also
available from NDLS centres. It must be submitted within 1 month of
completion.
