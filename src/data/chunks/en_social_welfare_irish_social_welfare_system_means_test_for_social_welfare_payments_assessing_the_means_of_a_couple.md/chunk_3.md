###  Blind Pension and State Pension (Non-Contributory)

For Blind Pension and State Pension (Non-Contributory) your means are taken to
be **half** of the total means of yourself and your spouse, civil partner or
cohabitant.

In the means test, all your sources of income are added together and 50% of
the total is taken to be your means. When assessing your means from capital
your combined capital is halved and this lower amount is assessed using the
standard formula. The resulting amount is then doubled before being added to
your other sources of income.

John is employed and has €30,000 savings and his wife Mary has €10,000
savings. They also have a joint account with €10,000. Mary has applied for
Blind Pension. Her means from capital is assessed as follows:  €30,000 +
€10,000 + €10,000 = €50,000  €50,000 ÷ 2 = €25,000  €25,000 assessed using the
formula above = €5  Mary's weekly means from capital is €5  Mary and John's
means from capital as a couple is €10 (€5 x 2)  This amount (€10) is then
added to any other means of the couple (e.g. John's wages)  (At the end of the
means calculation all Mary and John's sources of income will be added together
to get the couple's total means. This figure will then be halved to get Mary's
weekly means.)
