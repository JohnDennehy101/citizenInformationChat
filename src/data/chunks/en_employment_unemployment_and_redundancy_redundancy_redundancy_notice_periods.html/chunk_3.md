##  How your employer should give you notice

Your employer should give you notice of redundancy **in writing** when they
tell you they are making you redundant.

The notice must give you the date your employment will end ( _date of
termination_ ).

Your notice period only starts when your employer gives you this notice and a
finishing date. Your notice period does not start from when your employer
tells you that you are at risk of redundancy.
