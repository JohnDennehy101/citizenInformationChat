##  How long should my notice period be?

If you are being made [ redundant ](/en/employment/unemployment-and-
redundancy/redundancy/what-is-redundancy/) , your job won’t end straight away.
By law, you are entitled to a minimum paid notice period.

Your notice period goes up depending on how long you worked for your employer
– your _period of service_ .

**Notice periods for redundancy** **Period of service** |  **Minimum notice**  
---|---  
Between 13 weeks and 2 years  |  1 week   
Between 2-5 years  |  2 weeks   
Between 5-10 years  |  4 weeks   
Between 10-15 years  |  6 weeks   
Over 15 years  |  8 weeks   
  
For example, if you have worked for your employer for 5 years and 3 months you
get 4 weeks' notice.
