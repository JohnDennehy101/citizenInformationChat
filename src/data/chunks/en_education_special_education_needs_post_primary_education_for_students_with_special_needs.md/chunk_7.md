##  State examinations

Students with specific disabilities may be exempt from part of the examination
in a particular subject. In such cases, the certificates awarded may note that
the student has not sat an element of the examination. The annotation is made
where a core area of a subject is not assessed, or where the mode of
assessment used has the same effect. For example, hearing impaired students
may be exempt from the aural component of the examination. The certificate
would note that all elements of the subject were examined except the aural
element. Similarly, students with dyslexia may have spelling and grammar
waivers in language subjects and their certificates would note this.

The Equality Tribunal ruled in 2006 that this annotation was contrary to the
Equality Acts. On appeal, the Circuit Court found that the system of exemption
and related notation is a reasonable accommodation in the context of the Equal
Status legislation, and in June 2010 the High Court confirmed this finding.
This decision has since been appealed to the Supreme Court.
