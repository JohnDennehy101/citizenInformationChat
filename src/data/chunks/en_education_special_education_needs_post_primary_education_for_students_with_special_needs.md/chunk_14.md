##  How to apply for special educational supports

If your child has special educational needs you should talk to the school
principal about what learning supports are available in the school. If you
need advice about a post-primary school which could meet your child's needs
you should contact your [ local Special Educational Needs Organiser
](https://ncse.ie/special-educational-needs-organiser-seno) \- see 'Where to
apply' below.

Schools should contact the Building Unit of the Department of Education and
Skills for information about making schools accessible. Call the main
Department telephone number for assistance - see 'Where to apply'.

Schools should contact the National Council for Special Education (NSCE) which
administers and processes applications for special educational resources using
its network of Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs) - see 'Where to
apply'.
