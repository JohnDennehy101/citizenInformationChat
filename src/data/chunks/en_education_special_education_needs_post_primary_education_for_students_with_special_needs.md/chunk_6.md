##  Special schools

There are special schools throughout the country for students with more
complex needs. These schools provide education for students from 4 to 18 years
who have complex special education needs where a mainstream school would not
be in the student's best interests. Some special schools may provide for
students in their area with a broader range of needs.

In addition, there are post-primary schools for visually impaired and hearing
impaired students in Dublin. These schools cater for both day students and
boarders. There are a small number of schools for students with physical
disabilities and a small number of special schools for students who have
behavioural and emotional difficulties.

Students usually take the [ Junior Cycle and Leaving Certificate examinations
](/en/education/state-examinations/) .

The schools make provision for students whose level of disability would make
it very difficult for them to benefit from the Junior Cycle and Leaving
Certificate programmes. In some schools for students with mild learning
disabilities, students may be offered the opportunity to take part in the
Junior Cycle curriculum.
