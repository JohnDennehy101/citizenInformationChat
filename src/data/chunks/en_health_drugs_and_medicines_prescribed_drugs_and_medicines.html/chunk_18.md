####  Reference pricing

The HSE sets one price that it will pay for each group of the generic
medicines on the approved list. This is known as the [ reference price
](https://www.sspcrs.ie/druglist/pub) .

If you have a [ medical card ](/en/health/medical-cards-and-gp-visit-
cards/medical-card/) , the HSE will pay the reference price for any generic
medicine. If you choose to buy the more expensive brand of the medicine, you
must pay the difference between the reference price and the retail price.

If you are on the [ Drugs Payment Scheme ](/en/health/drugs-and-
medicines/drugs-payment-scheme/) , the HSE will use the reference price to
calculate your monthly drugs costs. If you choose a more expensive brand of a
[ medicine that is covered ](https://www.hse.ie/eng/staff/pcrs/items/) under
the Scheme, you must pay the extra cost.

If you need a particular brand of medicine for medical reasons, your doctor
can write 'Do not Substitute' on the prescription. If you have a medical card,
you pay the prescription charge and do not have to pay the difference between
the reference price and the retail cost. If you have a Drugs Payment Scheme
Card, you pay up to the monthly threshold as normal.
