###  Discretionary Hardship Scheme

If you have a medical card and are prescribed an item that is not on the PCRS
list, your pharmacist or Local Health Office can apply for it to be paid for
by the Discretionary Hardship Scheme.

If the hardship scheme does not cover the cost of the medicine and you have to
pay for it, you may want to check with your doctor to see if there is an
alternative medicine. You can get more information about the scheme from your
pharmacist or [ Local Health Office
](https://www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/1/lho/) .
