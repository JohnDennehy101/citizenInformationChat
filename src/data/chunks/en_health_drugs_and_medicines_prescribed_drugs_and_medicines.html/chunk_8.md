###  Other providers

You may be given medicines, drugs, aids or appliances as part of your
treatment in hospital or in another healthcare facility.

GPs may give drugs and medicines directly to patients if the GP has only one
practice centre and it is three miles or more from the nearest retail
pharmacist. Doctors who give drugs and medicines under these arrangements are
sometimes called _dispensing doctors_ .

The rules about when drugs and medicines are free or subsidised are the same
regardless of who provides them.
