####  Approved drugs and medicines

Drugs and medicines must be approved and controlled before they can be sold.
The [ Health Products Regulatory Authority ](http://www.hpra.ie/) (HPRA) tests
drugs and medicines for safety, quality and efficacy and provides licenses.
HPRA approval does not mean that the drugs and medicines will be approved for
the free and subsidised schemes. There are other factors involved in the
approval process, including costs.
