###  Agency workers

An [ agency worker ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/employment/types-
of-employment/agency-workers/) (sometimes called ‘temps’ ) works for an agency
and gets placed with another person or company.

Temporary agency workers don’t have all the same employment rights as regular
workers but you must be treated the same way in basic work conditions. This
means you must be treated as if you had been directly recruited by the hirer
when it comes to working hours, rest periods, night work, annual leave, public
holidays and pay.

For some employment and equality legislation, the party who pays your wages
will normally be considered your employer.

However, under [ unfair dismissal
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/employment/unemployment-and-
redundancy/dismissal/unfair-dismissal/) legislation, your employer is the
person or company who you work for and not the agency. They are also
responsible for ensuring your safety in the workplace.
