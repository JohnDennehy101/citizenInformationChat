##  How to complain about a guarantee orwarranty

If you are having problems using a guarantee or warranty, you should first
complain to the guarantor (the retailer or the manufacturer). You can get more
advice on [ how to make a complaint ](/en/consumer/how-to-complain/how-to-
make-a-complaint/) .

If you cannot resolve the problem directly with the seller or manufacturer or
you are not happy with their response, you can take a claim against the seller
using the [ small claims procedure ](/en/justice/courts-system/small-claims-
court/) .

Use out-of-court procedures such as the [ European Consumer Centre (ECC)
Ireland ](https://www.eccireland.ie/) (for cross-border disputes only) and [
Online Dispute Resolution ](/en/consumer/how-to-complain/online-dispute-
resolution/) (for national and cross-border online disputes).
