##  Advice on guarantees and warranties

If a product or service comes with a guarantee, or you are offered a warranty
at extra cost, you should read the terms and conditions carefully to check the
following:

  * If you need to do anything to activate it. For example, you may need to fill out a registration card and send it to the manufacturer to activate a guarantee. Failure to do so may mean that the guarantee is not valid. 
  * What exactly is covered? For example, does it cover parts only, is the cost of labour included, and will you be offered a replacement while the product is being repaired? 
  * Who will be honouring the guarantee or warranty? This may be the seller, manufacturer or a third party. 
  * How do you make a claim? 
  * How long will the cover last? For example, 12 months. 
  * Are there geographical restrictions? For example, if you buy the product in a different country will the warranty cover you for servicing in Ireland. 
  * What will it actually cost for repairs under a warranty and is it worth paying extra for this additional cover? For example: 
    * Is there a certain amount that you must pay, and the balance is covered by the warranty? 
    * Would it be cheaper to repair or replace the item rather than buy an extended warranty? 
    * Is the item already covered under your home insurance? 

You have certain protections under EU Law, including that the terms of a
guarantee or warranty cannot be unfair and go against your statutory consumer
rights. These rules are set out in the [ European Communities (Unfair Terms in
Consumer Contracts) Regulations (S.I. No. 27/1995)
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1995/si/27/made/en/print) . Find out more

conditions/) .

Always put your guarantee or warranty in a safe place together with
instruction manuals or any other relevant documentation such as proof of
purchase.
