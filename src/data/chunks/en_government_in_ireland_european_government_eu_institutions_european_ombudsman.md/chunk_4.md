###  Who can complain to the European Ombudsman?

If you are a citizen of a member state of the European Union or are living in
a member state, you are entitled to make a complaint to the European

in a member state may also lodge a complaint with the European Ombudsman.

Complaints to the European Ombudsman are free of charge.
