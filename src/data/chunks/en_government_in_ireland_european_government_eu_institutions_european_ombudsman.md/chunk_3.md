Citizens and people living in the EU have a right to access any document held
by an EU institution, with some exceptions. If the institution claims that an
exception applies to a document you have requested you can apply to the
European Ombudsmen to appeal this decision and give you [ access to the
document ](https://www.ombudsman.europa.eu/en/access-to-documents) . The
Ombudsmen has a [ fast-track ](https://www.ombudsman.europa.eu/en/access-to-
documents/fast-track) in place and aims to give a decision in these cases
within 40 days.

The European Ombudsman cannot deal with complaints concerning national,
regional or local authorities of member states, even when the complaints are
about European Union law. If the European Ombudsman is unable to investigate
your complaint, they will do their best to advise you of another body that
could help. The [ European Network of Ombudsmen
](https://www.ombudsman.europa.eu/en/european-network-of-ombudsmen/about/en)
was established in 1996 to connect the European Ombudsmen with national and
regional ombudsmen and make sure that complaints are dealt with at an
appropriate level.
