##  Investigation process

Once the European Ombudsman receives your complaint they will check whether
they can investigate it. If they determine that your issue falls within their
remit then they will open an inquiry you will be informed of this by letter.

The Ombudsman will first forward the complaint to the relevant institution and
request an opinion. The EU institutions are required to supply the Ombudsman
with any information they request. The Ombudsman may inspect documents,
conduct interviews and/or carry out an inspection at the institution. They may
also ask you for more information about your complaint.

Once the Ombudsman has finished their inquiry there are three possible
outcomes:

  * No Maladministration – the Ombudsman determines that the institution acted correctly 
  * A simple issue – in many cases the institution itself acts to settle the matter during the inquiry, or the Ombudsman is able to achieve a friendly solution that satisfies both you and the institution. 
  * Maladministration – if the Ombudsman finds that the institution acted incorrectly and cannot get the parties involved to agree on a solution, then they will make an official recommendation of what the institution should do. If the institution does not accept the recommendation then the Ombudsman can make a special report to the European Parliament. The Ombudsman’s decisions are not legally binding.
