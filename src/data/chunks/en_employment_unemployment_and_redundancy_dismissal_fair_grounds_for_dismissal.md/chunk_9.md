###  Breaking the law

Your employer can dismiss you if your continued employment would mean breaking
the law.

For example, if you need a current driving licence to work, but have lost your
licence on a drunk driving charge. In this case, you cannot continue to work
without breaking the law and dismissal may be justified.

However, your employer might be expected to look at alternatives to dismissal,
depending on all the facts of the case.
