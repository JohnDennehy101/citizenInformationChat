###  Short-term absences

Dismissal related to _short-term illness_ generally happens where you have a
medical problem resulting in frequent absences for short periods. Assuming the
nature of your problem is genuine, your employer must show that:

  * There is a pattern of absence 
  * It is causing problems 
  * The problem is unlikely to get better 
  * You have been warned that dismissal is likely
