##  Can I be dismissed if I am on sick leave?

If you have been on certified sick leave from work due to an illness or
injury, it is often assumed that you cannot be dismissed fairly. However, this
is not true.

Each case will be treated on its own merits (on a case-by case basis). Issues
such as length of service, previous record and the importance of the job will
vary and will have to be taken into account. These types of claim are often
divided into short-term and long-term absences.
