##  Examples of fair grounds for dismissal

Your dismissal from your job may be ‘fair’ if your employer can prove it
results from one (or more) of the following:

  * Your capability to do the job 
  * Your competence to do the job 
  * Your qualifications for the job 
  * Your conduct (behaviour) 
  * Redundancy 
  * Breaking the law 

These fair grounds for dismissal are set out in [ Section 6 of the Unfair
Dismissals Acts
](https://www.lawreform.ie/_fileupload/RevisedActs/WithAnnotations/HTML/EN_ACT_1977_0010.htm#SEC6)
.

Your employer must also prove they followed _fair procedures_ – read about
‘Fair procedures’ below. Your employer must also prove that any allegations
you have made that you were [ unfairly dismissed
](/en/employment/unemployment-and-redundancy/dismissal/unfair-dismissal/) are
untrue.
