###  Your capability to do the job

Your ‘capability’ includes issues such as lateness, absenteeism, and
persistent absence through illness or injury, either short-term or long-term.

If lateness or absenteeism is an issue, your employer should have proof of
this allegation, such as:

  * Clocking-in records 
  * Documented absences on file that are not medically certified 

Your employer will need to show that you were made aware of the problem and
that you were warned about the consequences.
