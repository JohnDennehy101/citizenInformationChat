##  Introduction

Capital Acquisitions Tax (CAT) is a tax on gifts and inheritances.

You can get a certain amount of gifts and inheritances without paying CAT.

The amount of gifts and inheritances you can get without paying CAT depends on
your relationship to the person you get them from. Relationships are grouped
into  3 categories with different tax-free limits  . Each limit applies to the
total of all the gifts and inheritances you get from people in that category.

CAT applies to all property in Ireland. It also applies if the property is not
in Ireland but the person giving or receiving it is [ resident or ordinarily
resident in Ireland for tax purposes ](/en/money-and-tax/tax/moving-country-
