###  Relations of a deceased spouse

If you get a gift or inheritance from a relation of your deceased spouse or
civil partner, you will be assessed with the same group as your spouse or
civil partner would have been if they got the benefit from their relation.

For example, if you get a benefit from the father of your spouse or civil
partner, the group threshold would be Group C. But if you get a benefit from
the father of your spouse or civil partner and your spouse or civil partner is
deceased, then the group threshold that applies to you would be the same as
for a child who gets a benefit from a parent, Group A.
