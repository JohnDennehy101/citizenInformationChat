###  **Valuation date**

In the case of a gift, the valuation date is usually the date of the gift.

In the case of an inheritance, the valuation date is the earliest of the dates
when the inheritance:

  * Can be set aside for or given to you 
  * Is actually set aside for you 
  * Is transferred or paid over to you 

The valuation date is the date of death if:

  * Someone gave you a gift in anticipation of their death. 
  * The giver reserved the right to take back the gift but has not done so. 
  * The property passes by survivorship. This means that you had a right to the property because of the death of another person who had an interest in it. For example, if you are joint tenants and you inherit the property when the co-owner dies.
