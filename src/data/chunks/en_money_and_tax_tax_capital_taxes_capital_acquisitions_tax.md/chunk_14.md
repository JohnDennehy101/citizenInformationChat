##  Tax rate

Capital Acquisitions Tax is charged at 33% on gifts or inheritances made on or
after 5 December 2012. [ Previous rates and thresholds are listed on
revenue.ie ](https://www.revenue.ie/en/gains-gifts-and-inheritance/cat-
thresholds-rates-and-aggregation-rules/historical-cat-thresholds.aspx) .

The tax rate only applies to amounts over the group threshold.

For example, if you have received gifts from your parents with a taxable value
of €550,000, you only pay tax on the amount over the relevant group threshold
(Group A: €335,000). So, €215,000 is taxed at 33%.
