###  **How to find a work experience placement**

Finding work experience can take time, so it is a good idea to start looking
for places that might offer it as soon as possible.

You can find work experience by:

  * Asking around local businesses, such as shops or offices 
  * Seeing if your school has any links with local companies or organisations who have dedicated Transition Year programmes – your guidance councillor or Transition Year Co-ordinator may be able to assist with this 
  * Asking your family or friends if they know anyone in an industry that interests you 
  * Finding out about volunteer opportunities with local community groups or organisations – you can find different volunteer roles on the [ National Volunteering database ](https://www.i-vol.ie/advanced-search/)
  * Speaking with your local [ Youth Information Officer ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/birth-family-relationships/services-and-supports-for-children/youth-information-centres/) about any opportunities that may be available 
  * Searching online – the Careers Portal website has [ a database of available work experience placements ](https://careersportal.ie/workx/student_search.php)

You can use the [ Careers Portal work worksheet (pdf)
](https://cc.careersportal.ie/pdfs/WorkPlacementWorksheetStudentsWeb.pdf) to
help you find and prepare for work experience.
