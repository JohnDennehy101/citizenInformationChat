###  **Applying for work experience**

Some workplaces have their own dedicated Transition Year work experience
programmes and application forms.

Research the places you are thinking of applying to and speak to your guidance
councillor or Transition Year co-ordinator if you need help with the
application process or what information you need to apply.

It is useful to phone to find out to whom a letter of application should be
addressed, so that it reaches the right person and you know who to follow up
with at a later date.
