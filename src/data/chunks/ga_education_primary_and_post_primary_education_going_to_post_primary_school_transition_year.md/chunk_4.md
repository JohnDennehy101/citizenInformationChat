##  How does Transition Year work?

Each school designs its own TY programme to suit the needs and interests of
its students. Schools must design the TY programme within set [ Transition
Year guidelines for schools (pdf)
](https://curriculumonline.ie/getmedia/9154f9d9-ad71-4be8-a2f1-1ba24684a766/ty_transition_year_school_guidelines.pdf)
and include core subjects that all students take for the full year, for
example, maths, English and Irish.

Transition Year is optional and admission criteria vary from school to school.

Activities and areas of study may include:

  * Environmental studies 
  * Drama 
  * Psychology 
  * Studies in language, tourism and business 
  * Social outreach 
  * Field trips and outdoor pursuits 
  * Media and communications 

Students can sample different subjects and areas of interest. This can help
them make informed choices about the optional subjects available for the
Leaving Certificate programme.
