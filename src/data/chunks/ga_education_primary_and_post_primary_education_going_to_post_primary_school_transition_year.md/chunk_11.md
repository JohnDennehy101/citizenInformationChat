##  Parents and Transition Year

Schools are encouraged to involve parents in the decision-making process and
planning for Transition Year.

Most schools arrange sessions for parents of third-year students to explain
Transition Year and how it works. Some schools run a 'Student Introduction to
Transition Year' seminar for Junior Cycle students to prepare them for the
year ahead.

Some ways parents can help during Transition Year include:

  * Attending classes during the year as visiting speakers to talk about their work and areas of expertise 
  * Assisting with the work experience programme if they are in a position to offer placements 

Parents are also invited to contribute to evaluating the Transition Year
programme so that it can be improved the following year.
