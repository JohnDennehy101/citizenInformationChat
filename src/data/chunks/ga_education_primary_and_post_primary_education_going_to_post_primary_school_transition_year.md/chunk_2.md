##  What is Transition Year (TY)?

Transition Year (also called TY) is an optional one-year programme between [
Junior Cycle ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/education/state-
examinations/junior-cycle-exam-and-results/) and [ Senior Cycle
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/education/primary-and-post-primary-
education/going-to-post-primary-school/senior-cycle/) . Transition Year is
part of a 3-year Senior Cycle, but it is separate to the [ Leaving Certificate
programme ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/education/state-
examinations/leaving-certificate/) which lasts 2 years.

Transition Year can help students as they change from the more dependent
learning of the Junior Cycle to the more independent, self-directed learning
of the Senior Cycle. It also offers opportunities for personal, social and
academic development and experience of adult and working life.

All post-primary schools have the option of offering the Transition Year
programme to their students and most of them do offer it.
