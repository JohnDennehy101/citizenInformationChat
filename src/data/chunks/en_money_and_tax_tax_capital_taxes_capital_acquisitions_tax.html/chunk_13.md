###  Taxable value

The value of your gift or inheritance is the best price you would get for it
on the open market on the valuation date.

The taxable value is the market value minus allowable deductions.

You can deduct costs, liabilities and expenses you have paid, including:

  * Stamp duty 
  * Legal costs 
  * Liabilities and taxes owed by someone leaving an inheritance 
  * Costs of [ administering the estate ](/en/death/the-deceaseds-estate/dealing-with-the-deceaseds-estate/)
  * Funeral expenses 

If you make a payment in return for the gift or inheritance or some other
contribution in return for it, this may also be deducted. This is known as a
'consideration' and could be, for example, a part payment, an amount paid
annually to the donor or someone else, or a payment of debts of the donor.

If you do not get full ownership but instead get a benefit for a limited
period, then there are a number of [ factors used to calculate the value of a
limited interest ](https://www.revenue.ie/en/gains-gifts-and-
