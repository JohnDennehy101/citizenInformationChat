##  Tax-free limits

You do not have to pay CAT if the amount you get is below a certain limit. The
tax-free amount, or threshold, depends on your relationship to the person who
gives you the gift or inheritance.

There are 3 different groups of relationship. The groups are called A, B and
C. The limit for each group is for the total amount you got in that category
since 5 December 1991.
