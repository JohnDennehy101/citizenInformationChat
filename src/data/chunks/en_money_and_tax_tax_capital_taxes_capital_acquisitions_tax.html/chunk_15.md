##  Making a return and paying CAT

If you get a gift or inheritance, then you are responsible for paying any
Capital Acquisitions Tax that is due.

You must make a tax return if the total value of gifts and inheritances you
get in one of the groups (A, B or C) since 5 December 1991 is more than 80% of
the tax-free threshold for that group.

If you are claiming [ agricultural relief ](https://www.revenue.ie/en/gains-
gifts-and-inheritance/cat-reliefs/agricultural-relief/index.aspx) or [
business relief ](https://www.revenue.ie/en/gains-gifts-and-inheritance/cat-
reliefs/business-relief/index.aspx) , you must make a return even if the
benefit is less than 80% of the threshold.

In some circumstances, you may be required to [ submit a tax return if you are
the person giving a gift ](https://www.revenue.ie/en/gains-gifts-and-
inheritance/completing-gift-or-inheritance-tax-return-it38/filing-obligations-
disponers.aspx) .

**Pay and file deadline**

If the  valuation date  is between:

  * 1 January and 31 August, you must file your return and pay by 31 October in that year 
  * 1 September and 31 December, you must file your return and pay by 31 October in the following year 

If you pay and file your tax return online using the [ Revenue Online Service
(ROS) ](https://www.revenue.ie/en/online-services/support/ros-help/getting-
started-on-ros/about-ros/index.aspx) , the deadline for filing your return is
usually slightly later.

**Making your tax return for CAT**

To make a return online, you must first register for CAT using [ myAccount
](https://www.ros.ie/myaccount-web/home.html) . To register, log in, go to
‘Manage my record’ and select ‘Tax registrations’.

After you register, you can make your tax return online using either:

  * [ myAccount ](https://www.ros.ie/myaccount-web/home.html) – go to ‘Gifts & Inheritances’ and select ‘File CAT IT38 Return’ 
  * [ ROS ](https://www.revenue.ie/en/online-services/support/ros-help/getting-started-on-ros/about-ros/index.aspx) – Select ‘Capital Acquisitions Tax (CAT)’ from the taxes listed 

The online CAT return form is called IT38.

**Simplified tax return**

There is a simplified version of the CAT return form called IT38S that you can
use online or on paper.

To use the simplified form:

  * You must not be claiming any reliefs, exemptions or credits except for the Small Gift Exemption 
  * The benefit must not have conditions or restrictions 
  * The benefit must be from one person only and not part of a larger benefit

it38s.pdf) or [ order a copy of the form ](https://www.revenue.ie/en/online-
