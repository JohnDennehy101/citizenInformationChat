####  Inheritance to a parent from their child

When you get an inheritance from your child:

  * Group A applies if you get full ownership of the inheritance. 
  * Group B applies if you get a [ limited interest ](https://www.revenue.ie/en/gains-gifts-and-inheritance/valuation-date-value-certain-benefits/limited-interest.aspx) . 

If you get a gift from your child, Group B applies.

You may be exempt from CAT on an inheritance from your child if, in the
previous 5 years, your child took a gift or inheritance from either parent and
it was not exempt from CAT. It does not have to be the same property or of the
same value. In this case, no tax needs to be paid even if the inheritance from
the child is over the threshold.
