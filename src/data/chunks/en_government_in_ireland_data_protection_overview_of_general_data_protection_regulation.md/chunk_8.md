##  Where the GDPR applies

The GDPR applies to the processing of personal data by controllers and
processors in the EU, regardless of whether the processing takes place in the
EU or not. The GDPR also applies to the processing of personal data of
individuals in the EU by a controller or processor established outside the EU,
where those processing activities relate to offering goods or services to EU
citizens or the monitoring of their behaviour.

Non-EU organisations processing the personal data of EU citizens must appoint
a representative located in the EU.
