##  What is the GDPR?

Many organisations, both public and private, hold information about you. This
can be as simple as your contact details or may be more detailed information,
such as your online browsing history. You may have concerns about privacy, or
about the accuracy and the further use of the information by the collecting
organisation and any other organisation it decides to share that information
with.

Such concerns have led to the development of data protection laws around the
world. In the EU, this area is generally governed by the General Data
Protection Regulation (GDPR). Specific EU laws also deal with matters such as
criminal investigations. There are additional laws in each EU member state. In
Ireland, these laws include the Data Protection Acts and other regulations.

These data protection laws mean that your personal data should generally only
be stored where there is a lawful basis, such as your consent, or where there
is a legal obligation.

You have a number of [ rights under data protection laws ](/en/government-in-
ireland/data-protection/rights-under-general-data-protection-regulation/) ,
like the right to access the personal data held and the right to have it
corrected or erased in certain circumstances.
