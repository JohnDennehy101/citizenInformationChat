####  Digital age of consent

Article 8 of the GDPR directs countries to set a minimum age at which online
service providers, including social media companies, can rely on a child’s own
consent to process their personal data. In Ireland, the Data Protection Act
2018 has set the age of digital consent at 16. This means that if an
organisation is relying on consent as the legal basis (justification) for
processing a child’s personal data and the child is under 16, then consent
must be given or authorised by the child’s parents or guardians.
