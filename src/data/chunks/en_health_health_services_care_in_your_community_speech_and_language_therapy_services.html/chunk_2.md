##  What is speech and language therapy?

If you have difficulty with your communication, speech, language, fluency, or
voice, you can be assessed by a speech and language therapist. They may be
able to diagnose and treat you. Speech and language therapists can also help
you with eating, drinking and swallowing (also called Dysphagia). [ Read about

health centres, hospitals and schools. You can get speech and language therapy
services in the public health service from the Health Service Executive (HSE).
