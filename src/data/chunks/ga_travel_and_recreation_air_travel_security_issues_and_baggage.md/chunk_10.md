##  Restrictions on liquids and security check points

Since 1 September 2024, the EU has introduced temporary changes that limit the
amount of liquids in carry-on hand luggage. The maximum capacity of each
liquid is 100 ml each. Exceptions for baby food, medicines, and dietary items
still apply.

In Dublin Airport, these changes are being phased due to the installation of
new C3 scanners, with full implementation expected by October 2025. You must
be prepared to remove all liquids, aerosols and gels from your hand luggage
before screening.

The rules are slightly different depending on which terminal you are departing
from in Dublin Airport.
