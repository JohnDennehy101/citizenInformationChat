###  Garda Reserve

The Garda Reserve is an unpaid body of voluntary members and can provide extra
personnel when required. Reserve Gardaí have certain Garda powers while on
duty and perform their policing duties under the supervision of, and supported
by, regular Gardaí.

Their main role is to do local patrols and crime reduction initiatives,
targeted at specific local problem areas.

Information on the Garda Reserve is available on the [ Garda website
