###  Garda regions and districts

Ireland is divided into 4 Garda regions, each of which has a regional
Assistant Commissioner.

The 4 regions are:

  * Dublin Metropolitan Region 
  * North Western Region 
  * Eastern Region 
  * Southern Region 

Each region is divided into divisions.

A Chief Superintendent is in charge of each division. Each division is divided
into districts, each of which has a superintendent in charge. Districts are
divided into sub-districts, each normally the responsibility of a sergeant.

Each sub-district usually has only 1 Garda station. The number of Gardaí in a
station can vary from 3 to 100 Gardaí.

Each district has a superintendent in charge (also known as the District
Officer). The superintendent has specific functions such as granting of
licences for the sale of alcohol and issuing firearms certificates.
