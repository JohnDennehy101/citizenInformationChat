###  Barrister partnerships

Barristers must operate as  sole traders  and are currently not allowed to set
up "chambers" or partnerships with solicitors or other barristers. However, it
is not uncommon for two or more barristers to work together on a case. Groups
of barristers can also come together to tender for government work.

The [ Legal Services Regulation Act 2015
](https://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2015/act/65/enacted/en/html) provides
for new business models for legal practitioners, including:

  * Solicitor-barrister partnerships 
  * Barrister-barrister partnerships 
  * Multi-disciplinary practices 

These new business models have not come into operation yet.
