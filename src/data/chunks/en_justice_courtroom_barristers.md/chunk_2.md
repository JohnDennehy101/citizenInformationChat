##  Introduction

A barrister (also called "counsel") is a type of lawyer who specialises in
court advocacy and giving legal opinions. There are two levels of barrister â€“
junior and senior counsel.

Barristers generally wear white collars and a black gown in most courts. They
may also wear a wig. In certain courts, such as the family law courts and the
children's court, barristers do not wear the wig and gown.
