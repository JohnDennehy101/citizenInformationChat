##  How do I complain about a barrister?

Before 7 October 2019, complaints about barristers were made to [ The Bar of
Ireland ](https://www.lawlibrary.ie/) through the Barristers Professional
Conduct Tribunal.

Since 7 October 2019, if you have a complaint about inadequate services,
excessive costs or alleged misconduct against barristers, you can make a
complaint to the [ Legal Services Regulatory Authority (LSRA)
](/en/justice/courts-system/legal-services-regulatory-authority/) .
