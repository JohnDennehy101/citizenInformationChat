##  What does a barrister do?

Barristers have a wide range of different functions, including:

  * Providing legal advice and opinions in contentious matters (where there is a dispute ultimately being determined by someone like a judge) and non-contentious matters. In non-contentious matters, some barristers may be able to provide advice directly to a client. 
  * Writing legal documents, such as [ writs or pleadings ](/en/justice/civil-law/writs-and-pleadings/) , that must be filed in a case. 
  * Representing you in court and arguing your case before a judge, if your case goes to trial. 
  * Negotiating a settlement of your case instead of it going to trial. 
  * Acting as mediators or arbitrators in [ alternative dispute resolution ](https://www.lawlibrary.ie/find-a-mediator-arbitrator/alternative-dispute-resolution/) , where you and the other party want resolve a dispute outside of court
