##  Introduction

The Back to Work Enterprise Allowance (BTWEA) scheme encourages people getting
certain social welfare payments  to become self-employed  . If you take part
in the BTWEA scheme you can keep a percentage of your social welfare payment
for up to 2 years. BTWEA is a payment made by the Department of Social
Protection (DSP) to people aged under 66.

There is also a separate Back to Work Scheme called the [ Short-Term
Enterprise Allowance ](/en/social-welfare/social-welfare-payments-and-
work/short-term-enterprise-allowance/) , which supports people on Jobseeker's
Benefit to start their own business.
