##  Rates

**If you qualify for the Back to Work Enterprise Allowance** you can keep the
following portion of your social welfare payment, including increases for a
qualified adult and qualified children, for a maximum of 2 years:

  * 100% for the 1st year 
  * 75% for the 2nd year 

**Change of circumstances**

If your circumstances change, your rate of payment for a qualified adult or
additional qualified children may be increased or decreased, depending on your
situation. However, if your BTWEA claim is based on a previous entitlement to
One-Parent Family Payment or Carer's Allowance, you cannot claim an increase
for a qualified adult as this would not have been payable on your underlying
entitlement.

If your qualified adult finds employment, this does not affect your BTWEA.
However, if your qualified adult claims another social welfare payment in
their own right, your BTWEA payment will be reduced accordingly.
