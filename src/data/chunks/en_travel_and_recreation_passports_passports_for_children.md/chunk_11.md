###  Sole guardians

The situation is different if you are the sole guardian of a child. This can
happen if you are a single mother and the father has not arranged to [ become
a joint guardian ](/en/birth-family-relationships/cohabiting-
couples/guardianship-and-cohabiting-couples/) . It also happens if the other
parent/guardian is deceased. If you are the sole guardian you will have to
provide [ an affidavit (AFF 1) ](https://www.ireland.ie/543/Annex-F1-Sole-
Guardian-Affidavit-EN.pdf) stating that you are the sole guardian. This should
be completed in the presence of a solicitor or [ Commissioner for Oaths
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/justice/civil_law/commissioners_for_oaths.en.html)
.

If the other parent/guardian is deceased, you will **also** have to provide a
death certificate. If a death certificate is not yet available as the [
coroner ](/en/death/sudden-or-unexplained-death/coroners/) has to hold an
inquest into the death, you should provide an Interim Certificate of the Fact
of Death which is issued by the coroner.

**Babies born in the UK** : If the birth was jointly registered by both
parents in Northern Ireland or Great Britain, the father may have joint
guardianship even if the parents never married.
