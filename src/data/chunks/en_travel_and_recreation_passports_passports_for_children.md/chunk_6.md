###  Sending documents

Once the application is completed, you will be asked to print an Application
Cover Page. This will list the documents you have to send to the Passport
Service. The Passport Service recommends that you use a secure method of
postage for sending your documents. A postage label is generated as part of
your application (if you are applying in Ireland).

If you are applying outside Ireland, you should use a reliable postal service.
In some countries, the local postal services are not reliable. In this case,
you can submit your documents to your nearest Irish Embassy.

You can read more about the documents you may need to send below.

Online service.
