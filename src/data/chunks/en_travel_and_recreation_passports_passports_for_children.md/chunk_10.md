###  Joint guardians

If you are or were married to the other parent of your child, and the other
parent is still alive, both parents or guardians must give guardian consent.

If you are a [ joint guardian ](/en/birth-family-relationships/cohabiting-
couples/guardianship-and-cohabiting-couples/) of the child, both parents or
guardians must give guardian consent.

If you are **applying online** , after you complete the online form you must
print out the Child Passport Identity and Consent Form which the guardians
must sign.

If you are applying or renewing **by post** or **in person** both guardians
must sign the parental consent section (Section 7) of the passport application
form.

If you are not in touch with your child's other parent/guardian, or if that
parent/guardian refuses to give consent, you can [ apply to the District Court
for a court order ](https://www.courts.ie/passport-issues) , which will allow
the Passport Service to issue the passport without that consent.
