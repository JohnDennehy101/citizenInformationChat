##  What documents do I need?

You must submit the following with your completed application form when you
are applying for a child’s passport for the first time:

  * Four passport photographs of the child, 2 of which have been signed by a witness as per instructions provided with the application form (or a digital photo if applying online) 
  * Child's birth certificate 
  * Appropriate fee 
  * PPS number (if the child is resident in Ireland) 
  * Additional documentation to confirm the child’s Irish citizenship. The documents you need to provide depend on how the child became an Irish citizen – see below.
