##  How to apply

Usually your employer deducts the contributions directly from your pay and
will give you the tax relief due.

If your employer does not deduct the contributions, you can use [ myAccount
](https://www.ros.ie/myaccount-web/sign_in.html?execution=e1s1) to complete
and file an income tax return.

If youâ€™re self-employed, you can apply for tax relief on contributions by
using the [ Revenue Online Service (ROS) ](https://www.revenue.ie/en/online-
services/index.aspx) .

Revenue has [ a video explaining how to claim tax relief for pension
contributions ](https://www.revenue.ie/en/self-assessment-and-self-
employment/filing-your-tax-return/help-claiming-a-relief-for-pension-
contributions.aspx) .
