##  Introduction

Taxis, hackneys, and limousines are types of small public service vehicles
(SPSVs). To drive an SPSV, you need a special licence and the vehicle you are
driving must be licenced to carry passengers. SPSVs can have seating for up to
8 people.

[ The National Transport Authority (NTA) ](https://www.nationaltransport.ie/)
is the government agency that issues taxi, hackney and limousine licences, and
regulates the industry.

It is unlawful to provide SPSV services without an appropriate licence. You
