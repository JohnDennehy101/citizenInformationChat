##  How are fares calculated?

If you are using a **hackney or a limousine** , you agree a price in advance.
It is unlawful for the driver to charge you more than the agreed price.

**Taxi fares** are different. The NTA sets the maximum rates that can be
charged, and a taximeter is used to calculate the distance travelled and the
time spent in the taxi.

A taxi driver can charge you less than the amount on the meter, but you cannot
be charged more.
