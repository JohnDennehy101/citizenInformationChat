###  Can a driver refuse to take me?

SPSV drivers cannot **unreasonably** refuse a fare, so long as it is below 30
kilometres distance. They can refuse you if you cannot show that you are able
to pay the fare. They can also refuse to take you (or ask you to leave the
vehicle) if you are acting in a disorderly, abusive, or offensive manner.
