##  What are the interest rates?

The interest rates are different depending on who you get your loan from. But
they will be lower than rates for regular personal loans. This is because the
interest rates are subsidised by the Government and the loans are backed by
the European Investment Bank.

The first banks participating in the scheme are offering rates that start from
3%.
