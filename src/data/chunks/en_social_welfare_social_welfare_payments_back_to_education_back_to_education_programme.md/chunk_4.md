###  Part-Time Education Option

If you are unemployed, the Part-Time Education Option allows you to keep your
Jobseeker's Allowance, Jobseeker's Benefit or Jobseeker's Benefit (Self-
Employed) and attend a part-time day or evening course that will improve your
chances of getting a job (including [ Springboard courses
](/en/education/third-level-education/applying-to-college/springboard/) ). You
continue to get your jobseeker's payment at your usual rate. You must also
continue to be available for and actively seeking work. This means you still
need to _sign on_ at your Intreo Centre or Social Welfare Branch Office.

There are no specific eligibility criteria for the [ Part-Time Education
Option ](/en/social-welfare/back-to-education/part-time-education-option/) .
You can be any age and may be unemployed for any length of time before
starting a part-time course of education.
