###  Dignity and privacy

The [ Code of Practice for Protecting Persons Employed in Other People's Homes
](https://www.workplacerelations.ie/en/what_you_should_know/codes_practice/cop10/)
states that the employer should respect the dignity and privacy of the
employee. If you are required to live in your employerâ€™s home, the employer
should give you a private secure room with a bed. If you must share a room,
this should only be with your agreement.

Employers should make it easy for you to carry out your personal pastimes and
interests outside of working time.

Under the code, your employer should not withhold any of your personal
documents, such as your passport or visa. Similarly, the employer should not
prevent you from joining a trade union.
