##  Your wages and tax obligations

Domestic workers are also entitled to a [ minimum wage
](/en/employment/employment-rights-and-conditions/pay-and-employment/minimum-
wage/) and a [ pay slip ](/en/employment/employment-rights-and-conditions/pay-
and-employment/pay-slip/) . If you work on Sundays, you are entitled to extra
pay or paid time off work.

Domestic workers should pay tax, PRSI and the Universal Social Charge (USC) in
the same way as other employees. The employer is responsible for deducting tax
from your wages. The employer must also pay the employer’s PRSI contribution
on your behalf – see ' _Paying tax, USC and PRSI for a domestic worker_ '
below.
