The [ Code of Practice for Protecting Persons Employed in Other People's Homes
](https://www.workplacerelations.ie/en/what_you_should_know/codes_practice/cop10/)
states that domestic workers have the same employment rights and protections
as any other employee under Irish law. The employer must tell you your rights.
