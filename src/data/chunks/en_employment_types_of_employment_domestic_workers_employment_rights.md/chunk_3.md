###  Am I a domestic worker?

If the homeowner is your employer, and if they deduct tax from your wages and
pay PRSI on your behalf, then you are employed as a domestic worker.

If you only work occasionally in someoneâ€™s home as a cleaner or carer, you may
not be employed as a domestic worker. Instead, you may be either:

  * Self-employed  (in this case, you are responsible for paying your own taxes and are not covered by employment rights legislation) 
  * Employed by an agency (in this case, you are an [ agency worker ](/en/employment/types-of-employment/agency-workers/) )
