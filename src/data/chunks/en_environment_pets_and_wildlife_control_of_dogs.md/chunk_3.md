###  **Before you get a dog**

Before getting a dog, you should consider if a dog is right for you and your
home. You should ask yourself these questions:

  * Does everyone in the house agree to getting a dog? 
  * Can I afford to feed and care for a dog? 
  * Will I have time to feed, care for and exercise my dog each day? 
  * What type of dog should I get, for example, which breed would best to suit my lifestyle and home? 
  * Who will look after my dog when Iâ€™m away from home? 
  * Will my landlord let me have a dog 

It can be expensive owning and caring for a dog. You need to pay for things
like:

  * The dog 
  * Dog food 
  * Bedding, collars and accessories 
  * A dog licence 
  * Microchipping 
  * Veterinary care 
  * Vaccinations 
  * Neutering 
  * Grooming 
  * Dog training 
  * Boarding fees
