###  Do I have to get my dog microchipped?

A microchip is a tiny electronic device injected by a vet under the skin of
the dog. The microchip is coded with a unique number for each dog. It can be
scanned to find out who owns the dog. Microchips can be scanned by the vets,
animal rescue organisations and the animal welfare unit in a local authority.

You [ must get your dog microchipped by a vet
](https://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2015/si/63/made/en/print) and registered
under your name on an authorised database before they are 12 weeks old. This
also applies if a dog leaves the property where they were born before they are
12 weeks old.

Getting your dog microchipped costs approximately â‚¬25. However, some
organisations will do this for free or at a lower price, for example, the
DSPCA mobile vet clinic.
