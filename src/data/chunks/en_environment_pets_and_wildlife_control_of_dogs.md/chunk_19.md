##  Dog control penalties and fines

Local authorities can introduce bye-laws with new rules about dog control in
their area.

If you are given an on-the-spot fine, this is given immediately without a
court process. You have a limited amount of time to pay the fine. If you do
not pay the fine in time, you may be prosecuted in court.
