###  What powers does a dog warden have?

Dog wardens can:

  * Request the name and address of anyone suspected of an offence under the Control of Dogs Act 
  * Seize and detain any dog 
  * Enter any premises to seize and detain a dog, apart from your home 

You can be arrested by a Garda if you:

  * Obstruct a dog warden in the course of their work 
  * Refuse to give your name and address to a dog warden 
  * Give a false name and address to a dog warden 

A dog warden can ask you for evidence of your dog licence and if you canâ€™t
provide this, they can issue an on-the-spot fine.
