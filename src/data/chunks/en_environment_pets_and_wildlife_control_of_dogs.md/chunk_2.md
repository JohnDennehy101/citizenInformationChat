##  Owning a dog

Owning a dog is a big commitment. If you own a dog, the dog is your
responsibility. You must have a dog licence and get your dog microchipped.
There are also additional responsibilities if you have a [ restricted breed of
dog ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/environment/pets-and-
wildlife/control-of-dogs/#5a28ab) .

Your dog must be under your control, or the control of another responsible
person if it is outside your home or premises. This means that:

  * You should make sure your dog is not a nuisance to others 
  * You must follow the rules about where dogs are welcome 
  * You should keep your dog on a lead in public places 

You are responsible for any injury or damage your dog causes to people or
livestock.

From, 1 October 2024, there will be new rules for people who own, breed, sell
and import XL Bully dogs. Read more on this in [ Restricted breeds of dog in
Ireland ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/environment/pets-and-
wildlife/control-of-dogs/#5a28ab) .
