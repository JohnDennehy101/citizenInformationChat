###  Stray and lost dogs

Stray dogs are dogs that are in a public place and are not with their owner or
a responsible person who is looking after them.

You can get an on-the-spot fine if your dog is not under proper control. Stray
dogs can be seized by the dog warden or Garda√≠ and brought to a dog pound.
These dogs may be put down or re-homed if their owners do not claim them
within 5 days.

If your dog is lost, has strayed or is missing, you should [ contact your
local dog warden ](https://www.ispca.ie/useful-info/dog-warden-info/) to check
if your dog is in the local shelter or dog pound. Before you collect it, you
may have to pay a re-claim fee and produce a current dog licence.

If you have [ found a lost dog you can report it
](https://www.ispca.ie/report_found_animal) to the Irish Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ISPCA) who will be able to help.
