###  Unwanted dogs

If you have a dog that you no longer want, you should contact the [ ISPCA
](https://www.ispca.ie/) . They may be able to find it a new home. Dog
charities or pounds may also accept unwanted dogs, although you may be charged
for this. Local authorities can accept unwanted dogs and put them down if they
cannot be rehomed or transferred to an animal welfare group.
