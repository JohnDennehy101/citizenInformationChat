###  Travel insurance

Travel insurance can cover you if you become ill or have an accident while you
are on holidays or travelling.

If you are travelling within the [ EEA
](https://www2.hse.ie/services/ehic/countries-in-the-eu-and-eea.html) or
Switzerland, you should have a [ European Health Insurance Card
](http://www.ehic.ie/) which allows you to access health care services. In
general, travel insurance should supplement the services available to people
with a European Health Insurance Card.
