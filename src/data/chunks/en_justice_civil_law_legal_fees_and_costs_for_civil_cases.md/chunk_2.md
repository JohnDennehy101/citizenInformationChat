##  Information

If you are taking a civil case to court in Ireland, as soon as possible after
you have given instructions to your [ solicitor
](/en/justice/courtroom/solicitors/) , he/she must advise you in writing of
the fees you would be charged for his/her services. If it is not possible to
give you a definite sum, he/she must estimate a sum or at the very least
describe the basis upon which charges or fees will be calculated. A solicitor
must generally wait until you confirm that you accept the charges provided
before providing legal services.

If it is proposed that a [ barrister ](/en/justice/courtroom/barristers/) be
engaged, you must be provided with an estimate of his or her cost by the
solicitor. If the barrister is then engaged, he or she must provide a
similarly detailed estimate in writing of his/her charges to the solicitor,
which is then passed to you.

When it becomes clear that the legal costs are likely to be significantly
greater than those initially set out, an updated notice in writing must be
provided to you. A lawyer must provide clarification in relation to any item
included in any notice as soon as reasonably practicable after you have asked
for it.

Usually lawyers will wait until a case is concluded before requiring payment
of their fees. However, sometimes fees will be requested in advance,
especially in a case where you run a high risk of losing.
