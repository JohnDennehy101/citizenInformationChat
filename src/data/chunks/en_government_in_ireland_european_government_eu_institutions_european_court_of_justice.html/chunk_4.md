###  Preliminary rulings

To avoid differences of interpretation of EU law by national courts, the
preliminary ruling procedure allows co-operation between national courts and
the Court of Justice. If a case comes before a national court that involves an
interpretation of an EU law and there is a doubt as to how it should be
interpreted, the national court can refer the question to the Court of Justice
to decide. The Court of Justice makes a decision as to how the law should be
interpreted or applied and sends that decision to the national court. The
national court must then apply that decision to the case before it.
