###  Enforcing the law

The [ Commission ](/en/government-in-ireland/european-government/eu-
institutions/european-commission/) or a member state may commence proceedings
at the CJEU to force a member state to comply with EU law. If the CJEU decides
that the member state in question is at fault, the member state must rectify
the situation without delay.
