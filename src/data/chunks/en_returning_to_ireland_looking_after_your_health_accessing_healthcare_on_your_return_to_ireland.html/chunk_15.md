##  Nursing home costs

If you return to Ireland and need financial support for nursing home care, you
can apply for the [ Fair Deal scheme
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/health/health-services/health-
services-for-older-people/fair-deal-scheme/) . You must be ‘ordinarily
resident’ in Ireland and need long-term nursing home care.

Under Fair Deal, you make a contribution towards the cost of your care and the
HSE pays the balance. The scheme covers:

  * Approved private nursing homes 
  * Voluntary nursing homes 
  * Public nursing homes. 

You can also apply for the [ Nursing Home Loan
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/health/health-services/health-
services-for-older-people/fair-deal-scheme/#5ed1d3) as part of this scheme.
