##  Bring your medical records home with you

Before returning to Ireland, ask your doctor for a copy of your:

  * Medical records 
  * Prescriptions 
  * Immunisation records 

It will be easier to access the healthcare you need if you have all the
necessary medical documents from the country (or countries) you lived in.

If you have been seeing a consultant or specialist in a hospital abroad, ask
them to send a copy of your records to your GP (doctor) in Ireland. If you are
not registered with a GP in Ireland yet, you can have these records
transferred after you have come back and registered with one.
