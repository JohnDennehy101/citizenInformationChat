##  Can I access public healthcare after living abroad?

You can access public health services if you have been living in Ireland for
at least a year, **or** if you intend to live here for at least one year. This
is called being [ ordinarily resident
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/health/health-system/entitlement-to-
public-health-services#l2b820) in Ireland.

Your entitlement to public health services in Ireland is not based on tax
payments or social insurance contributions (PRSI).

If you are still living abroad but are visiting Ireland for a short time, [
you may be entitled to free or subsidised public health services
