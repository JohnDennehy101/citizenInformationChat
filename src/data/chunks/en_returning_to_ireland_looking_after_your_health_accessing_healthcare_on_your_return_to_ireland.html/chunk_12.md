##  Do I need private health insurance?

Private health insurance in Ireland is optional. When you are ordinarily
resident in Ireland, you can get public health services for free or at a
reduced cost, so you don’t need to pay for private healthcare if you don’t
want to.

You can choose to get private health services from individual health
professionals or healthcare companies. If you have private health insurance,
it may cover some or all private medical expenses (depending on your policy).
If you don’t have private health insurance, you will have to pay for private
health services yourself.
