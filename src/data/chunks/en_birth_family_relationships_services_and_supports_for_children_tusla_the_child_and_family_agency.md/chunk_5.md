##  Educational Welfare Service - Tusla Education Support Service (TESS)

[ TESS ](https://www.tusla.ie/services/educational-welfare-services/) has 3
strands that work together with schools, families and other services to
achieve the best educational outcomes for children and young people.

  * [ Educational Welfare Services (EWS) ](https://www.tusla.ie/tess/tess-ews/) work with children and families who have difficulties in relation to school attendance, participation and retention. 
  * The [ School Completion Programme (SCP) ](https://www.tusla.ie/tess/scp/) supports primary and secondary school children and young people who are at risk of early school leaving, or who are out of school and have not successfully transferred to an alternative learning site such as Youthreach, Community Training Centre or employment. 
  * The [ Home School Community Liaison Scheme (HSCL) ](https://www.tusla.ie/tess/hscl/) promotes partnership between parents, teachers and community family support services to improve educational outcomes for children. The scheme also supports families as their children transition from early education to primary school, from primary school to secondary school and finally from secondary school to further and higher education, training or employment.
