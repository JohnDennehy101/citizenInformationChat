##  What is mortgage repayment protection insurance?

Mortgage repayment protection insurance is a type of payment protection
insurance. It will repay your mortgage for a certain amount of time if your
income is reduced because you have an accident or are made redundant, or for
any other reason covered by the particular policy. This type of insurance is
usually optional and will typically cover payments for 12 months.

You should check with your mortgage lender, insurance broker or insurance
