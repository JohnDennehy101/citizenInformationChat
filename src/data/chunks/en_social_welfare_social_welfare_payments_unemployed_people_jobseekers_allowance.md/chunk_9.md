* Jobseeker’s Allowance for people aged under 25 is €232, only if the person is living independently and getting a state housing support such as [ Rent Supplement ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/social-welfare-payments/supplementary-welfare-schemes/rent-supplement/) , [ Rental Accommodation Scheme (RAS) ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/housing/local-authority-and-social-housing/rental-accommodation-scheme/) or [ Housing Assistance Payment (HAP ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/housing/renting-a-home/housing-assistance-payment/) ). 

Reduced personal and qualified adult rates of Jobseeker’s Allowance (JA) for
people between 18 and 24 do not apply to:

  * People with dependent children 
  * People transferring from Disability Allowance to JA 
  * People who were in the care of the Child and Family Agency during the 12 months before reaching 18. 

If you were getting an age-related reduced rate of JA and you take part in a
course of education, training or an employment support scheme the appropriate
personal rate of payment applicable to that course or scheme will apply as
long as you are aged under 25. When you complete the course you will go back
to your previous age-related JA rate.

All Back to Education Allowance (BTEA) participants aged under 25 who were
getting a reduced age-related Jobseeker’s Allowance payment, get a maximum
BTEA rate of €232 per week. Any means you have are deducted from this rate.
