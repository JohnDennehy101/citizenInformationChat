and you must not be cohabiting with another person. You can keep your
entitlement to this pension if you are divorced or your civil partnership has
been dissolved, and you would have been entitled to this pension had you
remained married or in the civil partnership.

You must also:

  * Pass a [ means test ](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/means-test-for-social-welfare-payments/means-test/) and 
  * Be [ habitually resident ](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/social-assistance-payments/habitual-residence-condition/) in the State.
