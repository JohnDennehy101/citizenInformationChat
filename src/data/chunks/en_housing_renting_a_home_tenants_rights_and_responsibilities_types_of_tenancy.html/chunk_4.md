###  What tenancies does the residential tenancies legislation cover?

Residential tenancies legislation covers private residential tenancies. A
private residential tenancy is a tenancy that is agreed privately between a
landlord and a tenant. It includes tenancies under the [ Housing Assistance
Payment (HAP) ](/en/housing/renting-a-home/help-with-renting/housing-
assistance-payment/) and the [ Rental Accommodation Scheme (RAS)
](/en/housing/local-authority-and-social-housing/rental-accommodation-scheme/)
. If you are getting [ Rent Supplement ](/en/social-welfare/supplementary-
welfare-schemes/rent-supplement/) , you are probably renting from a private
landlord, so you would be covered by the residential tenancies legislation.

Residential tenancies legislation also covers [ approved housing bodies
](/en/housing/local-authority-and-social-housing/approved-housing-bodies/)
tenancies and tenancies in student-specific accommodation. But, there are some
differences in how the legislation is applied to these tenancies, see below. .
