##  What is security of tenure?

Security of tenure is a tenant’s right to stay in rented accommodation for a
set amount of time. Generally, security of tenure applies automatically when
you have been renting for 6 months and haven’t received a valid notice of
termination from your landlord in that time. When you have security of tenure,
your landlord can only terminate your tenancy for a limited number of reasons,
see our page [ If your landlord wants you to leave ](/en/housing/renting-a-
home/tenants-rights-and-responsibilities/if-your-landlord-wants-you-to-leave/)
.

The amount of time you are entitled to stay in rented accommodation after the
first 6 months depends on when your tenancy began. This is because rules about
security of tenure have changed.

**If your tenancy was created after 10 June 2022** , you will have a tenancy
of unlimited duration. This means if you have rented somewhere for 6 months,
you have the right to stay in that accommodation indefinitely (no end date),
unless the landlord wants to terminate your tenancy for one of the allowed
reasons.

**If your tenancy was created before 10 June 2022** , you have the right to
stay in the rented accommodation for up to 6 years after you have rented for 6
months. After these 6 years, the tenancy ends and a new tenancy can begin.
Your landlord can terminate the tenancy at the end of the six-year period
without giving a reason, as allowed under the old rules. But, if the landlord
does not end your tenancy at this stage, it automatically becomes a tenancy of
unlimited duration (no end date).

**By June 2028, all tenancies will be tenancies of unlimited duration. This is
because all existing 6-year cycle tenancies will have ended by then.**
