###  Format of termination notice

As a tenant, you can terminate your tenancy (whether fixed-term or periodic)
without giving a reason, but you must give a valid notice of termination to
your landlord. In order to be valid, this notice must:

  * Be in writing 
  * Be signed by you 
  * Specify the date that you are serving it on the landlord 
  * Specify the termination date of the tenancy (you have the full 24 hours of this date to vacate possession) 
  * State that any issue about the validity of the notice can be referred to the RTB within 28 days of receipt of the notice 

You can use the RTB's [ sample notice of termination
](https://www.rtb.ie/ending-a-tenancy/notices-of-termination/sample-notices-
of-termination) .
