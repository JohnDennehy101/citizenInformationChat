###  Further Part 4 tenancy

For tenancies created before 11 June 2022, a new tenancy begins after the
first 6-year cycle of your Part 4 tenancy. This new tenancy will now be a
tenancy of unlimited duration, unless the landlord terminates it, see
‘Landlords' right to end a tenancy every 6 years’ below. However, under the
old rules, you would have a further Part 4 tenancy.

When you have a Part 4 tenancy or further Part 4 tenancy, your landlord can
only terminate your tenancy in certain circumstances. Read more about when a
landlord can terminate your tenancy in our page [ If your landlord wants you
to leave ](/en/housing/renting-a-home/tenants-rights-and-responsibilities/if-
your-landlord-wants-you-to-leave/) .

If you have a fixed-term agreement and want to leave, you do not have to give
a reason, but you must give the correct period of notice in writing – see
‘Ending your tenancy’ below.
