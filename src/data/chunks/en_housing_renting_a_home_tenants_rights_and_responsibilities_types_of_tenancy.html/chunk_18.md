###  Ending a fixed-term tenancy

If you have a fixed-term tenancy agreement or a lease, you are also subject to
the terms of this agreement. The penalties for breaking a fixed-term lease can
be considerable, even if you give the correct amount of notice. For example,
you may:

  * Lose your deposit, if you leave before the term stated in the lease 
  * Have to pay rent for the remaining time left on the lease, even if the landlord has found a replacement tenant 

However, there are some exceptions, for example:

  * If there is a break clause in your lease, you can use it to end the tenancy 
  * If you and the landlord both agree to end the tenancy sooner 
  * If the landlord has breached their obligations under the lease, and has not rectified the issue within a reasonable time, then you only need to give 28 days’ notice 
  * If the landlord’s behaviour causes imminent danger of death or serious injury, or danger to the fabric of the dwelling, then you only need to give 7 days’ notice 
  * If a private landlord has refused permission to assign or sublet
