###  **Social insurance payments**

If you have worked and paid social insurance, you may qualify for a social
insurance payment.

When you apply for a social insurance payment, the DSP will check if you have
paid enough social insurance contributions to qualify. You may be able to use
your [ social insurance contributions from abroad
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-
system/claiming-a-social-welfare-payment/social-insurance-contributions-from-
abroad/) . For short-term payments (for example, Jobseekerâ€™s Benefit) your
most recent social insurance contribution must have been paid in Ireland.

If you think you might qualify for a social welfare payment, you should apply.
