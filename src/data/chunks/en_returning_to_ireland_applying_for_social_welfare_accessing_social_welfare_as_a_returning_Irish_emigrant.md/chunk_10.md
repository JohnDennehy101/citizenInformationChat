##  How quickly will I get a social welfare payment?

You should apply for a social welfare payment as soon as you can. It can take
several weeks for the Department to make a decision on your application for a
payment.

While you are waiting, you can apply for an immediate payment of the [
Supplementary Welfare Allowance (SWA)
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/social-welfare-
payments/supplementary-welfare-schemes/supplementary-welfare-allow/) . SWA is
paid if your income is below a certain limit.
