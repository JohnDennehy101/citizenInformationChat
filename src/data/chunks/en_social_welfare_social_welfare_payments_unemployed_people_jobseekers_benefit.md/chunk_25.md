##  When to apply for Jobseeker's Benefit

You should apply for Jobseeker's Benefit the first day you become unemployed.
Jobseeker's Benefit is not paid for the first 3 days you are unemployed (the
first 3 days are any 3 days, not necessarily consecutive, in a period of 7
consecutive days).

If you are unemployed for a second time within 26 weeks of your last JB
payment, your application for Jobseeker's Benefit is not treated as a new
claim and you do not have another 3 days of non-payment. See 'Linking claims'
above.
