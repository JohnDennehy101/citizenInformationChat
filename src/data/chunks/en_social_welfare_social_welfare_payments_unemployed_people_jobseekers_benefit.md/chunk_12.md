####  **PRSI contributions**

There are a number of circumstances in which you can be awarded [ credited
contributions ](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/social-
insurance-prsi/credited-social-insurance-contributions/) . For example, pre-
entry credits are given when you start employment for the first time in your
working life. However, you can only qualify for Jobseeker's Benefit when you
have actually paid 104 Class A, H or P contributions or at least 156 Class S
contributions. Credits are also awarded while you are getting certain social
welfare payments, including Jobseeker's Benefit (provided it is for 6 days), [
Illness Benefit ](/en/social-welfare/disability-and-illness/illness-benefit/)
and, in some cases, Jobseeker's Allowance.

Contributions you have paid in other member states of the EU or EEA will be
added to your Irish contributions. If you are applying for Jobseeker's Benefit
and need the contributions paid in another EU or EEA member state to help you
qualify, then your last contribution must have been in Ireland. Read more

](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2005/act/26/enacted/en/html) , employers
must register all employees for PRSI. Read more in our page on your [
