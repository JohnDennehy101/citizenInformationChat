###  Redundancy

If you are under 55 and get a redundancy payment of more than €50,000, you are
disqualified from claiming Jobseeker's Benefit for a certain period of time.
The table below shows how long you may be disqualified for. Any period of
disqualification is subtracted from your total Jobseeker's Benefit
entitlement. So, if you are disqualified for 3 weeks (which is 18 days'
payment) your JB claim starts on day 19.

**Amount of redundancy payment** |  **Period of disqualification**  
---|---  
€50,000.01 - €55,000  |  1 week   
€55,000.01 - €60,000  |  2 weeks   
€60,000.01 - €65,000  |  3 weeks   
€65,000.01 - €70,000  |  4 weeks   
€70,000.01 - €75,000  |  5 weeks   
€75,000.01 - €80,000  |  6 weeks   
€80,000.01 - €85,000  |  7 weeks
