##  When you arrive in Ireland

When you arrive in Ireland, you should speak to an immigration officer (at
Passport Control). You may be brought to Citywest Convention Centre in Dublin.
You can apply for temporary protection under the [ EU Temporary Protection
Directive ](/en/moving-country/asylum-seekers-and-refugees/the-asylum-process-
in-ireland/temporary-protection-directive#leaf67) .

If you arrive in Rosslare Port, you can apply for temporary protection in the
reception facility in the Port.

If you have a Temporary Protection permission, it is automatically renewed
annually as long as the Temporary Protection Directive is in force. You do not
have to do anything. You can use the [ notice on the immigration serviceâ€™s
website ](https://www.irishimmigration.ie/travel-confirmation-notice/) as
proof that your permission to live in Ireland has been extended.
