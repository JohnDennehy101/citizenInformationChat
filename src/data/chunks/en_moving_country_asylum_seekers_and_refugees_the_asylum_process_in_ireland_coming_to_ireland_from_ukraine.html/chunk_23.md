The [ Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) ](/en/education/pre-school-
education-and-childcare/early-childhood-care-and-education-scheme/) programme
is a free preschool programme for all eligible children before starting
primary school. Your child must be between 2 years and 8 months in the
September that the ECCE term starts. They cannot be older than 5 years and 6
months by the end of the ECCE term in June. ECCE is normally provided for 3
hours a day, 5 days a week over the school year.

childcare/national-childcare-scheme/) has 2 types of subsidy for children who
are aged over 6 months:

  * A universal subsidy for children under 15. It is not means tested.
