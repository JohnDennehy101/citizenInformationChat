##  Social welfare

You can find out more about getting income support in our page on [ social
welfare supports for Ukrainian refugees ](/en/moving-country/ukrainian-
refugees-in-ireland/social-welfare-supports-for-ukrainian-refugees/) .

If you are getting income support and plan to leave Ireland, you should tell
your local Intreo Centre or DSP branch office before you travel.
