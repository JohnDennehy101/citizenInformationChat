###  Can I drive in Ireland?

You can drive on your Ukrainian driving licence while in Ireland under
temporary protection. You can no longer exchange your Ukrainian licence for an
Irish driving licence.

If you have already exchanged your Ukrainian driving licence for an Irish
licence, you can continue to drive on your Irish licence for one year from the
date it was issued.

If you have already exchanged your Ukrainian driving licence and you want it
returned to you, send your Irish licence to National Driver Licence Service,
PO Box 858, Southside Delivery Office, Cork. You must include a letter in
English saying you want your Ukrainian licence returned. You must also include
your Irish address and phone number.
