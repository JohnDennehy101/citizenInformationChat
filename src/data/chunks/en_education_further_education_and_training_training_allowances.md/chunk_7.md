###  **If you are getting Disability Allowance or Blind Pension**

Your [ Disability Allowance ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-
welfare/social-welfare-payments/disability-and-illness/disability-allowance/)
or [ Blind Pension ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-
welfare/social-welfare-payments/disability-and-illness/blind-persons-pension/)
is suspended but you will get a FET training allowance of the same amount. The
rules that apply to your original social welfare payment also apply to your
FET training allowance. You must inform social welfare of any changes to your
circumstances.

You will also keep any secondary benefits, such as your medical card or travel
pass.

If you have a disability, the Education and Training Board will apply flexible
sick leave arrangements if necessary.
