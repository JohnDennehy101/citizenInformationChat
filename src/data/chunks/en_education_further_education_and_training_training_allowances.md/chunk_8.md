###  **If you are getting Illness Benefit or Invalidity Pension**

You will not get an FET training allowance, but you will keep your [ Illness
Benefit ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/social-welfare-
payments/disability-and-illness/disability-benefit/) or [ Invalidity Pension
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/social-welfare-
payments/disability-and-illness/invalidity-pension/) . (However, you must get
permission from the Department of Social Protection before you to do the FET
course).

The rules that apply to your social welfare payment will continue to apply
while you are on the FET course. You will keep your secondary benefits.
