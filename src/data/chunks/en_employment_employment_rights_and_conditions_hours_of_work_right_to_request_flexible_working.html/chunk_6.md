###  **Length of service**

You have the right to request flexible working from your first day in a new
job. However, you must have 6 months of continuous service (continuous
employment) before the arrangement can start.

If you left your job and came back to the same employer within 26 weeks, this
gap does not count towards the 6-month requirement.
