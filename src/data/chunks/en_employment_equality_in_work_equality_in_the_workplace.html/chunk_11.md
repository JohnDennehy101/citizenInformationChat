##  Making a claim under equality legislation

The Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission and the Workplace Relations
Commission are separate organisations that work to ensure equality at work.

The [ Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission ](/en/justice/law-and-
rights/irish-human-rights-and-equality-commission/) is a statutory body set up
to provide information to the public on human rights and equality legislation.
In some cases you can get legal assistance if you want to bring a claim to the
Equality Tribunal. You can read more in IHRECâ€™s booklet [ Your Employment
Equality Rights Explained ](http://www.ihrec.ie/publications/list/ihrec-

redress/workplace-relations-commission/) (WRC) investigates or mediates claims
of unlawful discrimination under equality legislation.

You can bring a discrimination claim under the Employment Equality Acts 1998
to 2015 using the WRC's online complaint form.
