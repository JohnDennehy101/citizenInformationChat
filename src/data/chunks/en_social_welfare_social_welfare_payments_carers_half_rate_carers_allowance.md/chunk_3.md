###  People parenting alone

People parenting alone, who meet the qualifying criteria for Carer's
Allowance, may qualify for both One-Parent Family Payment (OFP) and half-rate
Carerâ€™s Allowance (CA). If your youngest child is aged between 7 and 15
inclusive, you must qualify for Carer's Allowance to continue to qualify for
OFP. You will also get an Increase for a Qualified Child (IQC) for any other
children in your family until they reach 18 (or 22 if in full-time education)
while you are getting CA and OFP. (See our page on [ One-Parent Family Payment
](/en/social-welfare/families-and-children/one-parent-family-payment/) for
more information on other exceptions to the age limits.)
