###  Who makes the decisions?

Decisions about a planning appeal are never made by 1 person. This is to
ensure that An Bord Plean√°la's decisions are fair and impartial.

Normally, you need a minimum of 3 board members to make decision. However, if
a case is particularly sensitive or complex, all board members are normally
involved in the decision-making process.

Members of the board, its employees and consultants are legally obliged to
declare certain interests. This is to avoid any conflict of interest arising
during the appeal process.
