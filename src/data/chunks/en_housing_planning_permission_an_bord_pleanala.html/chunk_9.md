###  **Can they dismiss an appeal?**

An Bord Pleanála can dismiss an appeal in certain circumstances. For example,
if they believe the appeal was:

  * Only meant to annoy or disturb 
  * Not serious 
  * Without any real substance 
  * Made to delay the development 
  * Made for a profit (such as money or gifts) 
  * Made by someone who can’t be identified 

An Bord Pleanála aims to make a decisions on planning appeals within 18 weeks.
However, if this is not possible, they will contact everyone involved in the
appeal to update them.

There may be different timeframes in other types of cases. More information
