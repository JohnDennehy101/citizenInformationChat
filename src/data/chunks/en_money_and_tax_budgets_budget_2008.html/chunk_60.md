###  Public health measures

From midnight 5 December 2007 the price of a pack of 20 cigarettes will
increase by 30 cent (including VAT). Other tobacco products will also increase
pro-rata from that date.

A study is to be conducted into the public health benefits of a switch to
lower alcohol beverages. Measures will be introduced in Budget 2009 in this
area.
