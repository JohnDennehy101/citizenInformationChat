###  Lighting  

Minimum energy efficiency standards for lighting will be introduced from 2009.
The standards will result in an effective ban on the sale of the most
inefficient traditional light bulbs.

Legislation will be prepared by the Department of the Environment next year
setting a general energy efficiency standard of 25 lumens per watt. As part of
preparation of the legislation, there will be consultation with all
stakeholders to ensure the measures can be effectively implemented.
