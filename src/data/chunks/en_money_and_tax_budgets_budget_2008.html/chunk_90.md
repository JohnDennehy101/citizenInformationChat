###  Car leasing

A revised scheme of capital allowances and leasing expenses for cars used for
business purposes is being introduced. Cars will be categorised by reference
to CO2 emissions with the emissions bands being broadly consistent with the
new VRT system, as follows:

  * Cars with CO2 emission levels in Category A/B/C above will benefit from capital allowances at the current car value threshold under the existing scheme of €24,000, regardless of the cost of the car. Cars in Category D/E will receive allowances of 50% of the current car value threshold or 50% of the cost of the car, if lower. Cars in Category F/G will not qualify for capital allowances. 
  * As regards leasing expenses, cars in Category A/B/C will benefit from a proportionately higher deduction than the actual leasing expenses where the cost of the car is less than €24,000. Cars in Category D/E will get 50% of the leasing expenses they would otherwise benefit from under the current scheme. Cars in Category F/G will not qualify for a deduction for leasing expenses. 

The revised scheme will come into effect in respect of cars purchased or
leased on or after 1 July 2008.
