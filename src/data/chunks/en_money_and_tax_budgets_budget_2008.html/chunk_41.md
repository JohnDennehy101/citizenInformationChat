###  Vehicle Registration Tax (VRT) Relief Scheme for Hybrid Electric and
Flexible Fuel Vehicles and VRT exemption for Electric Vehicles.

The existing 50% VRT relief scheme for series production hybrid electric
vehicles and flexible fuel vehicles expires on 31 December 2007. The scheme is
being extended in its current form from 1 January 2008 until 30 June 2008, at
which point the revised VRT scheme based on CO2 emissions will be implemented.
From 1 July 2008 the relief for series production hybrid electric and flexible
fuel cars will be adjusted to provide a relief of up to â‚¬2,500 on the VRT
payable, in addition to the benefit of the new VRT CO2 emission related
system. This relief will apply until 31 December 2010\.

Series production electric cars (i.e. cars which can be propelled solely by a
rechargeable battery) and electric/battery-assisted bicycles are being
exempted from VRT with effect from 1 January 2008.
