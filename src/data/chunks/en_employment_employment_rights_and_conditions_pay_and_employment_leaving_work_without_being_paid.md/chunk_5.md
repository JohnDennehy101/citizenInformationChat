###  Unlawful deductions

If you have left work and you have not been paid or if your pay is less than
the amount due to you, this is an unlawful deduction under the Payment of
Wages Act. The only exception to this is where the non-payment or missing
amount is due to a mistake by your employer in calculating your pay.

So if you have lost your job but your employer has not paid the wages due to
you, you can apply for compensation by making a complaint under the Payment of
Wages Act 1991.
