##  When you leave work

When your employment ends, your employer should give you:

  * The pay you are owed and [ a payslip ](/en/employment/employment-rights-and-conditions/pay-and-employment/pay-slip/) (you will usually get these on the date you are normally paid, for example the end of the month) 
  * The [ redundancy payment ](/en/employment/unemployment-and-redundancy/redundancy/redundancy-payments/) you are due (if you have been made [ redundant ](/en/employment/unemployment-and-redundancy/redundancy/right-to-redundancy-pay/) ) 
  * Pay in lieu of (instead of) your notice period if you have not worked your notice period 
  * Pay for holidays you are entitled to (if you have not taken them) 
  * Pay for public holidays (if applicable) 
  * Information about what happens to your [ pension scheme ](/en/money-and-tax/personal-finance/pensions/occupational-pensions/) (if applicable) 

Check your final payslip for any extra payments or deductions. It should be
clear in the payslip what each payment or deduction is for.

You no longer get a P45 from your employer when you leave your job. Now, when
you leave a job your employer will enter your leaving date and details of your
final pay and deductions into Revenue’s online system. You can then view your
pay details through the ‘Manage your tax’ link in [ Revenue’s myAccount
](https://www.ros.ie/myaccount-web/sign_in.html?execution=e1s1) .
