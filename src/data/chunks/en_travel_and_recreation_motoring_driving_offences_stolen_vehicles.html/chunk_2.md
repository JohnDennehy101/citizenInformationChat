##  How to report a stolen vehicle

Every day cars are stolen from their owners. A car can sometimes be stolen
because of carelessness on the part of the owner, for example, by leaving your
vehicle unlocked or unattended in public places.

If your vehicle is stolen, you should report this to the Gardaí immediately
and call your insurance company. You can find the location of your nearest
Garda Station on [ Garda.ie ](http://www.garda.ie/Stations/Default.aspx) .

Vehicles reported as stolen are entered into a central database that all Garda
stations in Ireland can access. Vehicles reported as stolen can be monitored
and tracked by the Gardaí across the country.
