##  Recognising scams

Some scams are difficult to recognise.

Be cautious of:

  * Unsolicited contacts from a person or company out of the blue 
  * Deals that seem too good to be true 
  * Requests for personal details 
  * Pressure to respond or transfer money quickly 
  * Unusual payment methods 
  * Vague contact details 
  * Misspellings or grammatical mistakes 
  * Requests to keep the offer quiet
