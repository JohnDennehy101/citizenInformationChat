##  How does organ donation work?

If you have decided to donate your organs, they will only be removed when 2
doctors, working independently, have certified that you are dead following
many strict tests.

Donating your organs does not change how your body looks or delay your funeral
arrangements.

Sometimes your organs will not be used even if you are an organ donor. There
is medical criteria and other conditions that must be met. For example your
death must take place in a hospital for a safe transplantation to go ahead.
Your body will be maintained on a life support machine (ventilator).

If you have a medical condition this does not necessarily prevent you from
becoming a donor. The final decision will be made by a healthcare professional
at the time of your death.
