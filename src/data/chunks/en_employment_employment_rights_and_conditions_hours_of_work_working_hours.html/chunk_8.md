##  What if I work more hours than set out in my contract?

If you work on a low-hour contract of employment and you regularly work more
hours than what your contract says, you can ask your employer to change the
contract terms.

You are entitled to be put in a _band of hours_ (also called _banded weekly
hours_ ). This means your contract will better reflect the number of hours you
have worked over a 12-month period.
