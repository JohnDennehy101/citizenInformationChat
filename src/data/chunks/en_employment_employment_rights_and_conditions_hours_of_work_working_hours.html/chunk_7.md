##  Information about your working hours

Usually, you can find your working hours and work patterns in your contract of
employment. You may also find your hours in an [ Employment Regulation Order
or Registered Employment Agreement ](/en/employment/employment-rights-and-
conditions/industrial-relations-and-trade-unions/employment-agreements-and-
orders/) .

If your hours of work change from week-to-week, your employer must:

  * Tell you the starting and finishing times at least 24 hours before your first day of work. 
  * Give you at least 24 hours’ notice of your working hours for each day you have to work (particularly if you do not work every day). For example, they should put up a notice in an obvious place on a day that you are working. 
  * Give you 24 hours’ notice if you have to work additional hours. However, they can ask you to work at less than 24 hours’ notice in unexpected cases, for example when they need you to cover for another employee who is off sick. 

The work must take place within the reference hours and days you were told. If
you are not given the minimum 24 hours’ notice, you can refuse to work without
any negative effects.

This is set out in [ Section 17 of the Act
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1997/en/act/pub/0020/sec0017.html#sec17) ,
which was updated by [ Section 13 of the European Union (Transparent and
Predictable Working Conditions) Regulations 2022
