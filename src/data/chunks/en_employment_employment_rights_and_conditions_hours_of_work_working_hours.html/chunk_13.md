###  Overtime

_Overtime_ means work done outside your normal working hours.

There is no legal right to pay for working extra hours and there is no
statutory levels of overtime pay. However, many employers pay employees higher
rates of pay for overtime.

You should check your [ contract of employment ](/en/employment/employment-
rights-and-conditions/contracts-of-employment/contract-of-employment/) for
confirmation on:

  * Whether you must work overtime 
  * The rates of pay for overtime (if any) 

Certain sectors of employment have higher rates of pay for overtime than for
normal hours. This is covered by [ Employment Regulation Orders and Registered
Employment Agreements ](/en/employment/employment-rights-and-
conditions/industrial-relations-and-trade-unions/employment-agreements-and-
orders/) .
