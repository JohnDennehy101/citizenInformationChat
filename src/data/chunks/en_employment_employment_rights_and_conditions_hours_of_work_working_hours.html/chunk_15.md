##  How to make a complaint

If you have a complaint about your working week, you should speak to your
employer.

If you cannot resolve the problem with your employer, you can make a complaint
to the Workplace Relations Commission using the [ online complaint form
](https://www.workplacerelations.ie/en/Complaints_Disputes/Refer_a_Dispute_Make_a_Complaint/)
.

You should make your complaint **within 6 months** of the dispute or complaint
taking place. This time limit may be extended for a further 6 months, but only
if you had a _reasonable cause_ for not bringing the complaint within the
first 6 months.
