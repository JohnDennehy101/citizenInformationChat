##  Does travelling for work count towards my working time?

Most employees cannot include the time spent travelling to and from work in
their working hours. This is set out in [ Section 8
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2000/act/5/section/8/enacted/en/html) of
the National Minimum Wage Act 2000.

However, there may be different rules for workers with no fixed place of work
(where you do not work in the same place every day).
