###  Working on Sundays

If you work on Sundays, you are entitled to a benefit, such as extra pay. This
is usually set out in your contract of employment.

If you and your employer have not made an agreement about extra pay, then your
employer must give you one (or more) of the following:

  * A reasonable allowance 
  * A reasonable pay increase 
  * Reasonable paid time off work 

What is ‘reasonable’ depends on the situation. Your employer should discuss
this with you and your trade union (if you have one).

You can read more in the Workplace Relations Commission’s [ Code of Practice
for Sunday working in the Retail Trade
