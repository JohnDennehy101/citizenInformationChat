###  Applying to be put on banded weekly hours

If you want to be put on banded hours, you must apply to your employer in
writing.

Your employer will decide which band of weekly hours applies to you, based on
the average number of hours you worked each week during the past 12 months â€“
see the table below.

Your employer must place you on a band of weekly hours **within 4 weeks** of
the date you made the request. Once you are placed on banded hours, you are
entitled to work an average of those hours for the next 12 months.
