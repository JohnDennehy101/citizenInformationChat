##  Introduction

You can pay your Local Property Tax (LPT) in one single payment, or you can
pay in equal instalments over the year. You can change to a different payment
method at any time during the year by sending a request to Revenue.

This page explains how to pay the LPT. For information on who has to pay the
LPT, how much it is and how to make a return, [ read more about the Local
Property Tax (LPT). ](/en/money-and-tax/tax/housing-taxes-and-reliefs/local-
property-tax/)

You can [ defer payment of LPT ](/en/money-and-tax/tax/housing-taxes-and-
reliefs/deferring-local-property-tax/) if you meet certain conditions.

**If you paid LPT for 2023**

If you paid LPT for 2023 with a repeating payment method, such as a direct
debit, the payment will continue in 2024 unless you choose a different way to
pay. Repeating methods include LPT deductions from your salary, pension, or
social protection payment. If you have changed banks, you may need to [ update
your direct debit ](https://www.revenue.ie/en/property/local-property-
tax/paying-your-lpt/changing-bank-details.aspx) .

If you paid LPT for 2023 with a type of payment that does not automatically
repeat, you need to choose how you want to pay LPT for 2024. You can do this
in your [ Revenue property record ](https://www.revenue.ie/en/property/local-
property-tax/lpt-liability/your-revenue-property-record.aspx) .

You should have confirmed your payment method with Revenue by:

  * 1 December 2023, if you choose to spread the payments over the year 
  * 10 January 2024, if you choose to pay in a single payment 

**If you did not pay 2023 LPT**

If your property was not liable for LPT on 1 November 2022 but is liable on 1
November 2023, you must [ submit an LPT return
](local_property_tax.en.html#l5f2b1) by 1 December 2023.
