##  Making a single payment

You can pay your LPT **in full** by:

  * **Debit/credit card** : This option is available online. Note that if you pay by debit card or credit card the payment will be processed immediately. 
  * **Annual Debit Instruction (ADI)** : Under a single debit instruction you can authorise your bank or financial institution to pay Revenue the LPT due. The full payment is taken from your bank account on a date you choose, up to 21 March 2024. Your ADI will carry forward each year unless you change your payment option online or contact Revenue. 
  * **Cash payments** : you can pay in full by cash through an approved Payment Service Provider, up to 10 January 2024. A transaction charge usually applies.
