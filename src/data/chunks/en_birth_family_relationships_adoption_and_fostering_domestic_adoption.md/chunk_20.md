###  What if the mother cannot (or will not) consent?

If a mother or guardian cannot (or will not) consent to a proposed adoption,
the adoption can only proceed by an order of the High Court.

In this case, Tusla or the adopters must apply to the Court. They must prove
that the childâ€™s parents have failed in their duty to the child, and that this
failure can be considered legally as an abandonment of their parental rights
and duties.

For this application to be made, the case must first be heard before the Board
of the Adoption Authority of Ireland. Read the rules for these hearings on the
[ Adoption Authority of Ireland's website ](https://aai.gov.ie/en/what-we-
do/domestic/adoption-orders-and-hearings.html) .
