###  You are assessed

Applicants must go through a detailed assessment, including a number of
interviews and home visits. The assessment is carried out by a Tusla social
worker or an accredited adoption agency.

If you are applying for adoption as a married couple or as a cohabiting
couple, you will be interviewed individually **and** together.

The social worker will ask you about your:

  * Previous and current relationships 
  * Motives (reasons) for adopting 
  * Expectations of the child 
  * Ability to help a child develop their knowledge and understanding of their natural background (their birth story and where they came from) 

All applicants must also have a medical examination and [ Garda vetting
](/en/employment/employment-rights-and-conditions/data-protection-at-
work/garda-vetting/) .

After you have been assessed, the social worker prepares an ‘assessment
report’ which goes before the local adoption committee. The committee will
then make a recommendation.
