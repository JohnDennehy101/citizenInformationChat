###  The ‘best interests of the child’ are considered

The Adoption Authority of Ireland always puts the best interests of the child
first. The Authority will consider:

  * The child’s age and maturity 
  * The physical, psychological and emotional needs of the child 
  * The likely effect of adoption on the child 
  * The child’s views on their proposed adoption 
  * The child’s social, intellectual and educational needs 
  * The child’s upbringing and care 
  * The child’s relationship with their parent, guardian or relative as the case may be 
  * Any other circumstances affecting the child
