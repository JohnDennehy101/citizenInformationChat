##  Standards in residential services for people with disabilities

HIQA inspects your residential service against the [ National Standards for
Residential Services for Children and Adults with Disabilities
](https://www.hiqa.ie/reports-and-publications/standard/national-standards-
residential-services-children-and-adults) to make sure it complies with the
regulations.

The standards set out what a resident, their family, a carer, and the public
can expect in a residential care setting for people with disabilities. Service
providers must make sure they meet these standards.
