###  **Other differences**

All State-funded secondary schools must follow the national curriculum for:

  * [ Junior Cycle ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/education/primary-and-post-primary-education/going-to-post-primary-school/junior-cycle/) (for students in first, second and third year) 
  * [ Senior Cycle ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/education/primary-and-post-primary-education/going-to-post-primary-school/senior-cycle/) (for students in fifth and sixth year) 

But, secondary schools can vary in the subjects they provide. For example,
some schools offer a wider choice of international languages, while others
offer a wider range of practical subjects, like engineering and construction
studies.

Some schools give students the option to skip [ Transition Year
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/education/primary-and-post-primary-
education/going-to-post-primary-school/transition-year/) (fourth year), by
going directly from third year to fifth year. In other schools, Transition
Year is compulsory, and in some schools itâ€™s not offered at all.

While all schools must teach to the Leaving Certificate (also called the
Established Leaving Certificate), some secondary schools also offer:

  * [ Leaving Certificate Applied ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/education/state-examinations/leaving-certificate-applied/)
  * [ Leaving Certificate Vocational Programme ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/education/state-examinations/leaving-certificate-vocational-programme/)
