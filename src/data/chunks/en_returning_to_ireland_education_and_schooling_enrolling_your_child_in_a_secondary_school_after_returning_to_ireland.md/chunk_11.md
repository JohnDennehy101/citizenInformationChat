##  Step 4: Apply to the school

Always apply for a school place in writing. Check if the school has an
application form. If not, write a letter of application and address it to: The
Secretary, Board of Management, name and address of school. Remember to write
the date on your application.

Schools may ask for additional documents, such as previous school reports, a
birth certificate, and an educational assessment. Schools cannot ask for a
baptismal certificate as part of your application (as set out under the [
Education (Admission to Schools) Act 2018
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2018/act/14/enacted/en) ).

Keep a copy of your completed application form or letter, and copies of any
documents you submit with the application.

If you apply to a school mid-year or after the admissions period has passed,
the school should accept your child if they have a place available.
