###  **Home-school**

You have a right to educate your child at home, rather than send them to
school. Depending on your child’s age, you may need to [ apply for
registration to home school from the Alternative Education Assessment &
Registration Service ](https://www.tusla.ie/services/family-community-
support/alternative-education-assessment-and-registration-service/home-
education/) (AEARS) in Tusla, before you begin home-schooling. The AEARS
regulates education outside of recognised schools.

You do not need a formal teaching qualification to home-school your child and
you don’t need to follow the national curriculum. However, you must give your
child a ‘certain minimum education’. See our page ‘ [ Teaching your child at
home ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/education/the-irish-education-
system/home-education/) ’ for more information.
