##  I can’t find a school place

If a school tells you that your child is on a waiting list, ask where they are
on the waiting list and how you will be informed of any changes to their place
on the list.

If you cannot find a school place for your child, contact Tusla’s [
Educational Welfare Office ](https://www.tusla.ie/get-in-touch/education-and-
welfare/#EWO) in your area.
