###  If you are made redundant

If you are made redundant, you may qualify for a statutory redundancy lump sum
payment. The statutory (that means laid down by law) lump sum is the minimum
sum that you must get. A higher payment may of course be negotiated with your
employer, either by you or by your union. You can get more information about [
redundancy ](/en/employment/unemployment-and-redundancy/redundancy/what-is-
redundancy/) on our website.
