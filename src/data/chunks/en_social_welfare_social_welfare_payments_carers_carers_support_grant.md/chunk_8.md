##  How to apply

If you are getting Carer's Allowance, Carer's Benefit or Domiciliary Care
Allowance, you do not need to apply for the Carer's Support Grant. You will
automatically get it in June.

If you are not getting one of the above payments, you should fill in a [
Carer's Support Grant application form (pdf)
](https://assets.gov.ie/46552/3089ce6fa8d74561aad4c57dbdccd7ec.pdf) for each
person you are caring for.

You can also get the application form from your local:

  * [ Intreo Centre or Social Welfare Branch Office ](https://www.gov.ie/en/directory/category/e1f4b5-intreo-offices/) , or 
  * [ Citizens Information Centre ](http://centres.citizensinformation.ie/)
