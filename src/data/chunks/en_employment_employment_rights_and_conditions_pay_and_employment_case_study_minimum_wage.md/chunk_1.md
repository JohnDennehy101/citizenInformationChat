#  Case study: Minimum wage

The [ national minimum wage ](/en/employment/employment-rights-and-
conditions/pay-and-employment/minimum-wage/) increased to €12.70 from 1
January 2024.

Sean works 39 hours per week including 3 hours on a Saturday. He is entitled
to the minimum wage of €12.70 as he is 20 years of age, (People aged 20 and
above are entitled to 100% of the minimum wage) an employee and isn't on a
training or study course.

He is paid a gross wage of €500 per week. Sean's pay includes a €20 premium
for working Saturdays. He asked his employer about the national minimum wage
and his employer gave him the following information:

  * The pay reference period is weekly 
  * Dividing the gross pay (€500) by the hours worked (39), this gives an average hourly pay of €12.82 

This is above the current national minimum wage of €12.70 per hour. Is Sean's
employer correct?
