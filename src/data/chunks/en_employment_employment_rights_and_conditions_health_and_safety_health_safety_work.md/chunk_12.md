###  Computer screens

Employers have responsibilities in relation to visual display units (VDUs),
such as computer screens. For example:

  * Checking the reflection and glare 
  * Checking the employeeâ€™s position in front of the VDU 
  * Checking the keyboard and software used 
  * Giving employees adequate breaks from the screen 

Employers must also arrange for eye tests and make a contribution towards the
cost of prescription glasses, if required.
