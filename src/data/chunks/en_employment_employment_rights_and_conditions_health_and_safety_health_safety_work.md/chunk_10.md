###  Your rights during health and safety leave

During health and safety leave, you are treated as if you are still in
employment. This means you continue to accumulate (build up) your entitlement
to annual leave. However, you are not entitled to leave for any public
holidays that happen during this time.

During health and safety leave, your employer must pay you your normal wages
for the first 21 days (3 weeks). After 3 weeks, you may be able to get [
Health and Safety Benefit ](/en/social-welfare/families-and-children/health-
safety-benefit/) , depending on your PRSI contributions.
