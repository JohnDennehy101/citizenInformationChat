###  Violence at work

The possibility of violence towards employees should be covered in the safety
statement (see ‘Employer’s responsibilities’ above). For example, the safety
statement should address risk factors such as the isolation of employees and
the presence of cash on the premises.

Employers should put safeguards in place to eliminate the risk of violence, as
far as possible. They should also give the employee appropriate means to
minimise any remaining risk (for example, by installing security glass).
