###  Risk assessment and safety statement

Every employer must carry out a workplace risk assessment to:

  * Identify any hazards in the workplace 
  * Assess the risks arising from such hazards 
  * Identify the steps to be taken to deal with any risks 

The employer must also prepare a safety statement, based on the risk
assessment. The statement should include details of people in the workforce
who are responsible for safety issues. Employees should have access to this
statement and employers should review it regularly.
