##  Bullying and harassment at work

By law, employers have a duty to prevent [ bullying ](/en/employment/equality-
in-work/bullying-at-work/) and [ harassment in the workplace
](/en/employment/equality-in-work/harassment-at-work/) .

Employers should have procedures for dealing with complaints of bullying and
harassment, and they should deal with these complaints immediately. Ignoring
complaints could leave an employer open to a possible claim by an employee for
damages or compensation.

Read the:

  * [ Code of Practice for the Prevention and Resolution of Bullying at Work (pdf) ](https://www.hsa.ie/eng/publications_and_forms/publications/codes_of_practice/code_of_practice_foremployers_and_employees_onthe_prevention_and_resolution_ofbullying_at_work.pdf)
  * [ Code of Practice on Sexual Harassment and Harassment at Work ](https://www.ihrec.ie/documents/code-of-practice-on-sexual-harassment-and-harassment-at-work-2/)

If you feel you are the victim of bullying or harassment at work, follow your
employer’s procedures (these may be set out in your employee handbook or
contract of employment).

If you cannot resolve the complaint with your employer, you can complain to
the [ Workplace Relations Commission ](/en/employment/enforcement-and-
redress/workplace-relations-commission/) – see ‘Make a complaint about health
and safety' below.
