###  Personal injury claims

You cannot claim compensation from your employer under the health and safety
legislation, but you can make a personal injury claim through the [ Injuries
Resolution Board ](/en/justice/civil-law/injuries-resolution-board/) .

The Injuries Resolution Board is an independent statutory body that assesses
personal injury claims after workplace accidents. If the Injuries Resolution
Board finds your employer is responsible for the accident, it will set the
amount of compensation they must pay you.

All claims involving workplace accidents and personal injury (except cases
involving medical negligence) must be submitted to the Injuries Resolution
Board. You cannot take your claim to court before the Injuries Resolution
Board gives you permission.
