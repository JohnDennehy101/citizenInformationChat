##  Health and safety leave during pregnancy

Employers should carry out separate risk assessments for pregnant employees.
If there are risks to an employee’s pregnancy, these risks should be removed
or the employee should be given alternative ‘risk-free’ duties.

If neither of these options are possible, the employee should be given ‘health
and safety leave’ from work. This leave can continue up to the beginning of
her maternity leave. This is set out in [ Section 18 of the Maternity
Protection Act 1994
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1994/en/act/pub/0034/sec0018.html#zza34y1994s18)
.

If a doctor certifies that night work would be unsuitable for a pregnant
employee, she must be given alternative work or health and safety leave.
