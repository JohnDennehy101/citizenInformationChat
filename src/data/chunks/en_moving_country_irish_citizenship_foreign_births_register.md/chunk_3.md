##  Who can become an Irish citizen through the Foreign Births Register?

If you were born in Ireland and you qualify to be an Irish citizen by birth,
your child is automatically an Irish citizen by birth, even if the child was
born in another country. You do not have to register their birth with the
Foreign Births Register. You can simply apply for an Irish passport for your
child. You can read more about [ Irish citizenship by birth ](/en/moving-
country/irish-citizenship/irish-citizenship-through-birth-or-descent/) .

If you were born outside Ireland, and you are not an Irish citizen by birth,
you can become an Irish citizen if:

  * One of your grandparents was born in Ireland 

or

  * One of your parents was an Irish citizen at the time of your birth but was not born in Ireland. Your parent may have claimed citizenship through the Foreign Births Register themselves, or become a citizen by naturalisation. 

In both these cases, you become an Irish citizen by registering your birth
with the Foreign Births Register.

Once a person is entered onto the Foreign Births Register they are an Irish
citizen and entitled to apply for an Irish passport.
