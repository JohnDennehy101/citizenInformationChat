##  Introduction

Millions of people around the world have Irish ancestry. The Foreign Births
Register allows the descendants of Irish people who have moved abroad to claim
Irish citizenship. If each generation registers their birth before the next
generation is born, then Irish citizenship can be passed from parent to child.

This document explains how the register works, who can apply and how to go
about making an application.

The current expected processing time is 9 months for Foreign Births Register
applications.
