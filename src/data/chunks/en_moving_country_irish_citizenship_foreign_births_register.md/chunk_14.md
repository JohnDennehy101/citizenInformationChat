##  What can I do if my application is refused?

If your application is refused and you supplied all the correct documentation,
you can appeal the decision. You will get a letter telling you that your
application has been refused, and you should write a letter of appeal within 6
weeks of the date of the refusal.

You can also ask to amend or delete an entry in the Foreign Births Register.
See ‘Further information and contacts’ below.
