###  Step 2: Documents

Check that you have the documents that you need to make an application. You
need the following documents for you (or your child if you are applying on
their behalf):

  * Original civil birth certificate (showing parent’s details) 
  * Marriage certificate or change of name document (if applicable) 
  * Certified photocopy of current state-issued identification (passport, drivers licence, national identity card) 
  * Two proofs of address (not photocopies). If you are applying on behalf of a child, you must also include a letter from the child’s school or doctor 
  * Four photographs (see ‘Step 5’ below) 
  * If you are applying on behalf of a child, but you are not the parent of the child, you must include proof of guardianship 

You must also provide documents relating to **the person you are basing your
application on** . This will be either your grandparent or parent.

**In all cases you should send the Irish citizen’s** :

  * Original civil birth certificate 
  * Original marriage certificate or change of name document (if applicable) 
  * Certified photocopy of current state-issued identification (passport, drivers licence, national identity card) or certified copy of death certificate if they are deceased 

If you are applying because your grandparent was born in Ireland, you must
also include the documents listed above for your Irish citizen parent.
