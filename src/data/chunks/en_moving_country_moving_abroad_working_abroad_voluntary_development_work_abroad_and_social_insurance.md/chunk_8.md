###  Career breaks and social insurance contributions

If you took a career break from your normal employment to work abroad and you
are not re-employed immediately when you come back to Ireland you should
contact your [ local social welfare office or Intreo centre
](http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/List-of-Social-Welfare-Local-and-Branch-
Offices-by-County.aspx) .

The general rule is that returned volunteer development workers can claim
Jobseeker's Benefit if the period of their career break has expired and there
is no work available from their previous employer. However, if your career
break has not expired, you are not entitled to claim.
