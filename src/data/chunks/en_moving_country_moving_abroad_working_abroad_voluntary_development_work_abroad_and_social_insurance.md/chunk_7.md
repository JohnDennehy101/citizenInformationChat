###  Five-year limit

VDW credits can only be awarded for a maximum of 5 years. Different periods of
work as a volunteer development worker (VDW) are added together to calculate
the 5 years. For example, if you were a VDW for 3 years, and wish to go abroad
as a VDW for another 3 years, you will only qualify for VDW credits for 2
years of your second assignment.

If your assignment abroad is more than 5 years, you are, where possible,
awarded VDW credits for the period that is most beneficial to you.
