###  PRSI contributions – paid and credited

How the scheme operates depends on the social insurance (PRSI) contributions
you paid before you go abroad:

  * If you have **104 weeks or more** of PRSI contributions paid or credited since the start of your working life, you get VDW credits for the period you spend as a volunteer development worker (up to 5 years). 
  * If you have **less than 104 weeks** of PRSI contributions paid or credited, then Comhlámh will make contributions on your behalf until you have 104 weeks contributions. After that, you get VDW credits in the normal way (for up to 5 years). 
  * If you had 2 consecutive tax years with **no paid or credited contributions** immediately before you went abroad as a volunteer development worker, Comhlámh will pay Class A contributions for the first 26 weeks of your assignment.
