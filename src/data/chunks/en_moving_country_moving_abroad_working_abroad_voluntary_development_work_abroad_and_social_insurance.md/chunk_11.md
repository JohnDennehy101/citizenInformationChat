##  How to apply for VDW credits

You can apply for credited contributions by completing [ Form VOL DEV 1 (pdf).
](http://www.welfare.ie/en/pdf/vol_dev1.pdf) Completed forms should be
returned to your sending agency, which will in turn forward it to Comhlámh.
Ensure that you quote your correct [ Personal Public Service (PPS) number)
](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/personal-public-service-
number/) when you complete the form.

Comhlámh then validates the credentials of the sending agency and verifies
that you are working overseas on _volunteer terms_ .

Following validation, Comhlámh contacts the Special Collection Section of the
Department of Social Protection and the period of your assignment is noted by
this office.
