###  Who is a volunteer development worker?

Volunteer development workers are people who are:

  * Working temporarily outside Ireland in a developing country 
  * On volunteer terms (this means that the salary or wage you get is consistent with local rates of pay in the developing country) 

The work must have been arranged by or through Irish Aid, or through another
organisation validated by [ Comhl√°mh ](https://comhlamh.org/social-services-
and-pensions/) and approved before you leave Ireland.

Members of religious orders whose work involves pastoral duties **are not**
considered to be volunteer development workers under the scheme.
