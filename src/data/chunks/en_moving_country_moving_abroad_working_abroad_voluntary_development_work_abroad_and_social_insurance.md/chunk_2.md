##  Introduction

If you are living in Ireland and have spent time working in a developing
country, you may qualify for [ credited social insurance contributions
](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/social-insurance-
prsi/credited-social-insurance-contributions/) under the Volunteer Development
Worker Scheme.

These credited social insurance contributions are called _VDW credits_ . VDW
credits are normally fully reckonable, that is, they are treated the same as
paid social insurance contributions. Therefore, when you come back to Ireland,
VDW credits can help you qualify for social welfare benefits and pensions.

In addition, some of the qualifying conditions for payments have been relaxed
for returned volunteer development workers. See ‘How do VDW credits help me
qualify for social welfare payments’ below.

[ Comhlámh ](https://comhlamh.org/social-services-and-pensions/) administers
the VDW Scheme on behalf of the Department of Social Protection. Comhlámh is a
charity that is mainly funded by [ Irish Aid ](https://www.irishaid.ie/) . It
works to promote global development.
