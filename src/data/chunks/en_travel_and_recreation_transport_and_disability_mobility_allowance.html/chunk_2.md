##  Introduction

Mobility Allowance was a means tested monthly payment payable by the Health
Service Executive (HSE) to people who are aged 16 and over and under age 66,
and who have a disability and are unable to walk or use public transport and
who would benefit from a change in surroundings; (for example, by financing
the occasional taxi journey). There is no specific legislation providing for
Mobility Allowance. Instead, this Allowance was introduced in 1979 by the
Department of Health and is payable under [ Section 61 of the Health Act, 1970
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1970/en/act/pub/0001/sec0061.html#zza1y1970s61)
.

**In 2013** , the [ Department of Health announced that the Mobility
Allowanced scheme was closed ](http://health.gov.ie/blog/press-
release/mobility-allowance-and-motorised-transport-grant/) to new applicants.
An [ alternative scheme is being devised ](http://health.gov.ie/blog/press-
release/government-decision-in-relation-to-a-travel-subsidy-for-people-with-a-
disability/) replace it. This alternative scheme will be called the Transport
Support Scheme. In the meantime, the HSE continues to make monthly payments to
people who were getting the Mobility Allowance at the time that the scheme
closed.
