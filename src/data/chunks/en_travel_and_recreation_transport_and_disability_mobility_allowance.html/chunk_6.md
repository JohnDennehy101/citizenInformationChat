####  Carerâ€™s payments

If your spouse/civil partner/cohabitant is receiving Carer's Allowance or
Carer's Benefit, the payment is ignored. Instead, your income is assessed as
being your primary payment plus any increases for qualified children, plus the
Supplementary Welfare Allowance increase for a qualified adult.

Where Carer's Allowance or Carer's Benefit is paid in respect of you to
someone who is not your spouse/civil partner/cohabitant, it is ignored and you
are assessed on your own assessable income.
