###  Assessment and examinations

Students are assessed continuously throughout the course and there is a final
examination.

Students are assessed on the completion of modules and practical activities
that allow you to integrate learning from different courses.

The final examination must be taken in:

  * English and communication 
  * Two vocational specialisms 
  * Mathematical applications 
  * Language 
  * Social education 

There are written and oral examinations in all languages. There are practical
examinations in the vocational specialisms. The written examinations usually
take place in June, at the same time as the examinations for the established
Leaving Certificate.

Since September 2022, students taking the LCA programme can choose to take the
established Leaving Certificate Mathematics and an established Leaving
Certificate Modern Language.
