###  ‘Heel prick’ test

You will also be offered ‘newborn bloodspot screening’ for your baby by the
midwife or public health nurse to see if they are at risk of a number of rare
conditions. This is also known as the 'heel prick test' and it usually takes
place when your baby is between 3 and 5 days old.

You will be asked for your consent. The test usually takes place in your home.
However, if you remain in hospital longer than 72 hours after the birth of
your baby, it may take place in the hospital.

HSE website.

After the first visit, the public health nurse may visit you again if needed.
The public health nurse is available at your local health centre and will
continue to see you and your baby at intervals over the next 3 and a half
years.
