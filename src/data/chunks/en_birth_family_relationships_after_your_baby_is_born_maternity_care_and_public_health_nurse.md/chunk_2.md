##  Introduction

Public health nurses are registered nurses with a specialist nursing
qualification. They provide nursing and midwifery care in the community.

If you have had a home birth, or domino delivery (where your care is provided
by a team of midwives during pregnancy, labour and birth), your midwife will
have already visited you. They will then hand over your care to your public
health nurse.

If you have your baby in hospital, your local public health nurse will be told
about the birth. They will arrange an appointment to visit you at home. This
home visit usually happens within 72 hours after you have been discharged from
hospital.
