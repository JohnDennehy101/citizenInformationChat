###  Children adopted abroad

Adopted children have the same rights as your biological children as long as
the adoption is recognised under Irish law.

If you intend to adopt a child while living abroad, you should contact the [
Adoption Authority of Ireland ](https://www.aai.gov.ie/en/where-to-start.html)
.

If you have already adopted a child abroad and you have not registered the
adoption in Ireland, you should apply for the adoption to be entered in the [
Register of Intercountry Adoptions ](https://aai.gov.ie/en/who-we-are/inter-
country/rica.html) .

Once it is registered in Ireland, the adoption has the same legal status as if
the adoption was made in Ireland.
