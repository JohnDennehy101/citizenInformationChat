###  Children born abroad

If you (or the other parent of your child) are an Irish citizen who was born
in Ireland, then your child is automatically an Irish citizen, no matter where
they are born. This means that you can apply for an Irish passport for your
child.

If you or your child’s other parent were not born in Ireland, but one of you
is an Irish citizen, your child can get Irish citizenship, but you must [
register your child’s birth in the Foreign Birth Register
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/moving-country/irish-
citizenship/foreign-births-register/) . Your child can apply for an Irish
passport once they are registered in the Foreign Birth Register.
