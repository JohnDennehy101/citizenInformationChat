####  Assessment

The lender must pass the completed SFS to its Arrears Support Unit (ASU) for
assessment.

The lenderâ€™s ASU must assess the completed SFS in a timely manner and examine
your case on its individual merits. The ASU must base its assessment of your
case on your full circumstances. These include your personal circumstances;
overall indebtedness; information provided in the standard financial
statement; current repayment capacity; and previous payment history.

Before completing the assessment, it may agree a temporary alternative
repayment arrangement if a delay would make your situation worse.
