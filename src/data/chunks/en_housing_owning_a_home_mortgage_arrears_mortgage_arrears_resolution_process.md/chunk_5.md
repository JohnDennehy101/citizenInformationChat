##  Communication

A mortgage arrears problem arises as soon as you fail to make a full mortgage
repayment or only make a partial mortgage repayment on the date it is due.

If the arrears remain outstanding 31 days from this date, the lender must
inform you in writing of the status of the mortgage account. This letter must
include full details of the payment(s) missed and the total amount now in
arrears. It must also explain that your arrears are now being dealt with under
the MARP; the importance of co-operating with the lender; the consequences of
non-cooperation; and the impact of missed repayments or repossession on your [
credit rating ](/en/money-and-tax/personal-finance/loans-and-credit/your-
credit-history/) .

The lender must also send you an information booklet including details on the
MARP, relevant contact points for arrears issues and details of websites with
mortgage arrears information, such as [ mabs.ie ](http://www.mabs.ie/) . (You
must also get this if you are in pre-arrears.)

For as long as you are in arrears, the lender must give you a written update
of the status of your account every 3 months.

If an [ alternative repayment arrangement ](/en/housing/owning-a-
home/mortgage-arrears/alternative-mortgage-repayment-arrangements/) has not
been set up, and you miss a third repayment (full or partial), the lender must
tell you the following in writing:

  * The potential for legal proceedings and loss of your property, and an estimate of the costs to you of such proceedings 
  * The importance of taking independent advice from [ MABS ](http://www.mabs.ie) or an appropriate alternative 
  * That even if your property is sold, you will remain liable for any outstanding debt, including any accrued interest, charges, legal, selling and other related costs.
