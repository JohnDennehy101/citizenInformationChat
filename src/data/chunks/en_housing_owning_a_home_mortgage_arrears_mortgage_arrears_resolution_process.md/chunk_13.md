####  Mortgage-to-rent option

If you have worked through the MARP with your lender and agree that you can no
longer afford to pay your mortgage loan now or in the future, the lender may
approve you for the [ national mortgage-to-rent scheme ](/en/housing/owning-a-
home/mortgage-arrears/mortgage-to-rent-scheme/) , depending on your
circumstances. Under this scheme, people who cannot pay their mortgage can
switch from owning their home to renting their home as a social housing
tenant.
