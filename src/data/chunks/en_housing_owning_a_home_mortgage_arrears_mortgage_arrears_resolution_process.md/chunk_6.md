####  Level of communication

Under the CCMA, each lender’s Board must agree a communications policy, which
ensures that:

  * The level of communications with borrowers is proportionate and not excessive. Communications must not be unnecessarily frequent. 
  * Communications are not aggressive, intimidating or harassing 
  * Borrowers get enough time to complete agreed actions (with help if needed) before any further communication 
  * Steps are taken to agree future communications 

The lender can make an unsolicited visit to your home only if other attempts
to contact you have failed and you are about to be classified as not co-
operating. You must get at least 5 business days’ notice and you can opt to
meet in the lender’s office instead. You can choose to have a third party with
you. The lender’s letter announcing the visit must explain the implications of
not co-operating.
