####  Financial information

Lenders must provide a standard financial statement to get financial
information from a borrower in arrears or in pre-arrears, so that they can
assess your financial position and identify the best course of action. All
lender must use the [ industry standard format (pdf)
](https://www.centralbank.ie/docs/default-source/Regulation/consumer-
protection/other-codes-of-conduct/36-gns-4-2-7-financial-
statement.pdf?sfvrsn=4) for every standard financial statement (SFS). The
Central Bank has a [ consumer guide (pdf)
](https://www.centralbank.ie/docs/default-source/Regulation/consumer-
protection/other-codes-of-conduct/35-gns-4-2-7-mortgage-arrears---
sfs.pdf?sfvrsn=4) to completing an SFS.

When providing the financial statement, the lender must ensure that you
understand the MARP process. It must offer to help you complete the SFS and
mention sources of independent advice, such as MABS. It must give you enough
time to assemble the information and complete the SFS, and must give you a
copy of the completed statement.

You may need to provide supporting documentation to verify the information in
the SFS.
