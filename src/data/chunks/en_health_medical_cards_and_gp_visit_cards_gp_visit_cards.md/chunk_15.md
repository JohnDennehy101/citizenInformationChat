###  Appealing your GP visit card application

If your application for a GP visit card is refused, you will receive a letter
from the HSE to let you know. The letter will also set out the reasons why
your application has been refused.

If you are not satisfied with the decision, you may have it reviewed. Your
circumstances may have changed, or you may have left out some relevant
information from the original application.

If you are not satisfied with the review, you can make an appeal to the [
Appeals Office of your HSE Area ](https://www2.hse.ie/services/schemes-
allowances/medical-cards/applying/appeal/) . You can also find the contact
details for the Appeals Office in the letter of refusal from the HSE.

The Appeals Office will conduct a reassessment of your application. This will
be conducted by HSE staff who were not involved in deciding on your original
application.
