##  Calculating Mortgage Interest Supplement

Calculating your Mortgage Interest Supplement can be difficult. The Community
Welfare Officer (CWO) decides whether you are eligible for Mortgage Interest
Supplement and calculates the amount you get.

The CWO:

  * Adds together any income taken into account in the means test 
  * Subtracts any income not taken into account 
  * Adds your remaining income and household contribution together to find your household contribution (see ‘Minimum household contribution’ above) 

The Mortgage Interest Supplement payable to you is the difference between your
actual mortgage interest and your contribution to mortgage interest, as long
as the difference between them is a reasonable amount to meet your residential
needs.

Generally, the CWO will ensure that your income after paying the interest on
your mortgage does not fall below a minimum level. This level is the
Supplementary Welfare Allowance minus €30 (or €40 for couples).
