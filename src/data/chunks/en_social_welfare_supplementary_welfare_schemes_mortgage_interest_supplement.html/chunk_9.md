###  **Employment and Mortgage Interest Supplement**

You will not qualify for Mortgage Interest Supplement if you are in full-time
employment (if you are working for 29 hours per week or more).

In the case of couples, if one of a couple is in full time employment, both
are excluded from claiming Mortgage Interest Supplement.
