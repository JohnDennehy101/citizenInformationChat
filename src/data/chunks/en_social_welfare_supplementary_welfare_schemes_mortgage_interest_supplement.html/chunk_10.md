####  **Special retention arrangements**

There are special retention arrangements that may allow you to keep a
proportion of your Mortgage Interest Supplement (for example, if you are
participating in a [ Community Employment Scheme
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/employment/unemployment-and-
redundancy/employment-support-schemes/community-employment-scheme/) or getting
[ Back to Work Enterprise Allowance
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/social-welfare-
payments-and-work/back-to-work-enterprise-allowance/) ).

Your gross household income must not exceed €317.43 per week. The below are
not taken into account in the assessment of your gross household income:

  * Back to Work Enterprise Allowance 
  * [ Working Family Payment (WFP) ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/families-and-children/working-family-payment/)
  * [ PRSI ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/social-insurance-prsi/social-insurance-classes/)
  * Any childcare allowance payable on certain training courses 

Under these special retention arrangements, you will continue to get:

  * 75% of your Mortgage Interest Supplement rate during your first year in employment 
  * 50% in the second year of employment 
  * 25% in the third and fourth years of employment 

After the fourth year you will no longer be entitled to Mortgage Interest
Supplement if you are in employment.

These retention arrangements also apply to people who have been unemployed for
12 months or more and who return to full-time employment and sign off their
social welfare payment. In these cases, gross household income must not exceed
€317.43 per week.
