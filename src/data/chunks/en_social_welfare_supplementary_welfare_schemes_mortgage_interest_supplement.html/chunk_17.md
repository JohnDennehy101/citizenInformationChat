carers-allowance/) is never taken into account.

allowance/) , the amount of Carer's Allowance above the appropriate SWA rate

personal rate of SWA) is not taken into account.

  * One of a **couple** and getting Carer's Allowance, the amount of Carer's Allowance being paid less the SWA qualified adult rate is not taken into accoun **t**
  * **Single or a lone parent** , the amount disregarded is the rate of Carer's Allowance being paid less the personal rate of SWA
