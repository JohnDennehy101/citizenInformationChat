##  Means test for Mortgage Interest Supplement

When you apply for Mortgage Interest Supplement your means will be assessed.
This will show how much of the mortgage interest you are able to pay.

A means test examines all your sources of income. However, some income is not
taken into account in the calculation of your means.

You may qualify for Mortgage Interest Supplement if your income is below a
certain amount and you meet the other conditions (see 'Mortgage Interest
Supplement rules' above).
