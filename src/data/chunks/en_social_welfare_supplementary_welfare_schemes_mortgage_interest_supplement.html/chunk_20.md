###  Maintenance and Mortgage Interest Supplement

Maintenance is assessed as additional household income and maintenance
payments up to €95.23 per week are assessed. However, from 4 June 2024,
maintenance payments for a child are not included in the means test.

The household income disregard (see above) applies to maintenance payments
above €95.23.

For example, if your only additional household income is maintenance, all of
your maintenance payment (excluding child maintenance) up to €95.23 per week
is assessed. The household income disregard of €75 applies to sums above this,
so that any maintenance between €95.23 and €170.23 is not taken into account.

25% of all maintenance over €170.23 is also not taken into account.
