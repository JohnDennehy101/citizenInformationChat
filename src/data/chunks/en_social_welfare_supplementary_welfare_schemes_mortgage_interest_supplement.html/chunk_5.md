###  **If you were getting MIS before 1 January 2014**

Your interest is assessed as your gross monthly interest less:

  * [ Mortgage interest relief ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/housing/owning-a-home/buying-a-home/mortgage-interest-relief/) , and 
  * Any mortgage allowance or [ mortgage subsidy ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/housing/owning-a-home/help-with-buying-a-home/first-home-scheme/) payable towards the interest part of your mortgage by the local authority 

You will only get assistance with the interest portion of your mortgage
repayments. You will not get help with the portion that pays off the actual
loan and house insurance.

You should contact your lender to discuss repaying the actual loan. If you
have a consolidated loan, only the interest portion of your loan that relates
to the essential purchase, repair or maintenance of your home will be taken
into account.
