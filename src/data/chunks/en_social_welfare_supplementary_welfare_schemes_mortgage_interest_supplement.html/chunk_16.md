####  **Pensioners**

There is an income disregard for people aged 65 and over. Any additional
income equal to the difference between the maximum [ State Pension
(Contributory) ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/older-
and-retired-people/state-pension-contributory/) and the SWA appropriate to
their circumstances is not taken into account. This also applies where one of
a couple is of pensionable age.
