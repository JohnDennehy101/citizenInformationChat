##  Introduction

When you apply for a driving licence or learner permit, it is issued in the
name and address you provided at that time. If you later change your name or
address, you can exchange your current licence or permit for an updated one.

You need to provide documents that prove the change. Your new licence or
permit will have the same expiry date as your original licence or permit.

There is no charge for changing your name or address (personal details). If
your driving licence is due for renewal or has been lost, stolen or damaged, a
fee will apply. If you are 70 years or over, you are exempt from paying the
fee.
