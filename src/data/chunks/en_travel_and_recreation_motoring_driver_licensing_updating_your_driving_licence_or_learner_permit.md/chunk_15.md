###  Proof of identity

You can use your [ Public Services Card (PSC) ](/en/social-welfare/irish-
social-welfare-system/public-services-card/) as proof of identity. The name
and address on your learner permit or driving licence application must match
the name and address on your PSC if you want to use your PSC as photographic
ID and proof of address. If you are an EU/EEA citizen you can also use the PSC
as proof of your residency entitlement, otherwise, you must provide a document
from the 'Proof of your residency entitlement' list below.

If you don't have a PSC, you need one document listed on the NDLS website from
each of the sections below:

  * [ Photographic ID ](https://www.ndls.ie/how-to-apply/applying-in-person.html#photo-id)
  * [ Proof of your residency entitlement ](https://www.ndls.ie/how-to-apply/applying-in-person.html#evidence-of-normal-residence)
  * [ Evidence of your PPS Number ](https://www.ndls.ie/how-to-apply/applying-in-person.html#evidence-of-ppsn)
  * [ Proof of address ](https://www.ndls.ie/how-to-apply/applying-in-person.html#evidence-of-address)

Note: Proof of address documents can be no more than 6 months old at the date
of application. Mobile phone bills and statements from store cards/catalogue
companies are not accepted. You can find a full list of [ documents that will
not be accepted ](https://www.ndls.ie/how-to-apply/applying-in-
person.html#documents-that-will-not-be-accepted) on the NDLS website.
