##  Introduction

Professional qualifications are qualification requirements that a person must
have to work in a regulated profession.

You can check if your profession is regulated in Ireland (and in other EU
member states, EEA countries and Switzerland) on the [ European Commission’s
regulated professions database ](http://ec.europa.eu/growth/tools-
databases/regprof/index.cfm) .

Some examples of regulated professions in Ireland are:

  * Electrician 
  * Teacher 
  * Architect 
  * Doctor 
  * Accountant 
  * Pharmacist 
  * Estate agent 
  * Gas installer 
  * Dental hygienist 
  * Security guard 

This page gives an overview of how professional qualifications are recognised
in Ireland and Europe. For information on academic qualifications, you can

**Coming from Ukraine**

If you are coming to Ireland from Ukraine, Quality and Qualifications Ireland
has information (in Ukrainian) about its [ academic qualifications recognition
service (pdf) ](https://www.qqi.ie/sites/default/files/2022-03/naric-guide-

recognition service (NARIC).

If you qualified as a teacher in Ukraine and have been granted [ EU Temporary
Protection ](/en/moving-country/asylum-seekers-and-refugees/the-asylum-
process-in-ireland/temporary-protection-directive/) , you can apply to work as
a teacher in Ireland under The Teaching Council’s tailored [ registration
process for teachers from Ukraine
