##  How are professional qualifications regulated in Ireland?

The Department of Education is responsible for coordinating the recognition of
professional qualifications in Ireland. It provides online information on [
regulated professions and relevant EU legislation
](http://www.pointofsinglecontact.ie/regulated%20professions%20in%20ireland/)
.

It also keeps a database of [ competent authorities
](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/d7527-professional-qualifications-
recognition/#contacts) . Competent authority means any regulatory or
professional body that can validate professional qualifications that you
received outside Ireland. You can see some examples of regulated professions
and contact details for those professions in the table below.
