##  How are professional qualifications regulated within the EU?

Each EU member state sets its own national system of education and training,
which leads to its own professional qualifications.

The EU has [ systems for recognising diplomas and training
](http://europa.eu/youreurope/citizens/work/professional-
qualifications/index_en.htm) that enable you to make full use of your training
and skills in another EU country. The basic principle is that if you are
qualified to work in a profession in your home country, you are qualified to
work in the same profession in any other EU country.

However, if the profession is regulated in the country where you wish to work,
you will need to register with the regulator for that country before you can
start work. The bodies which regulate professions may also be called competent
authorities. See ‘How are professional qualifications regulated in Ireland?’
below.

If your profession is not regulated in the country where you wish to work, you
do not need to have your qualification recognised.
