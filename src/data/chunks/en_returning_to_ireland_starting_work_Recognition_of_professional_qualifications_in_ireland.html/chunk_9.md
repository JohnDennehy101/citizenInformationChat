###  What happens after you apply?

After you apply, the competent authority has 4 months to reply. It may accept
your qualification, reject it or apply a compensation measure.

A compensation measure is where the competent authority considers that your
training is significantly different in terms of duration or content from that
in the host country. You may be asked to get additional professional
experience to complete your training, or to take a training course or an
aptitude test.
