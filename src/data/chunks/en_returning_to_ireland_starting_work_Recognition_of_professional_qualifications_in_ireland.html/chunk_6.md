##  European Professional Card (EPC)

The European Professional Card (EPC) is an electronic procedure you can use to
have your EU professional qualifications recognised in another EU country. It
is not a physical card. It is electronic proof that you have passed
administrative checks.

After you get the EPC, and before you take up employment in Ireland, you must
register with the relevant [ competent authority
](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/d7527-professional-qualifications-
recognition/#contacts) .

You can use the EPC procedure if you are a:

  * Nurse responsible for general care 
  * Pharmacist 
  * Physiotherapist 
  * Mountain guide 
  * Real estate agent 

The European Commission has published an introductory [ video
](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3if_6ZHsMM) about the EPC on its [ Your
Europe information portal
](https://europa.eu/youreurope/citizens/index_en.htm) . For more detailed
information, you can also read the [ EPC User guide (pdf)
