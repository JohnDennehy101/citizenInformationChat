###  **If there is no jury**

If there is no [ jury
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/justice/courtroom/jury/) in a case, it
is the judge who decides which party wins and which party loses.

The judge listens to the [ evidence
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/justice/evidence/) of both sides and
to the submissions of the [ barristers
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/justice/courtroom/barristers/) (or [
solicitors
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/justice/courtroom/solicitors/) ). The
judge may ask questions of any [ witness
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/justice/witnesses/) and of the
barristers (or solicitors).

The judge may give the judgment in the case at the end of the trial or they
may "reserve" the judgment. When a judgment is reserved, the judge will take
time to consider the case and then at some later stage deliver the judgment.
