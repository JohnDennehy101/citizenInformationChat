##  Judicial assistant

Judges appointed after 2011 are [ assigned a judicial assistant
](https://aji.ie/supports/judicial-assistants-researchers/) rather than a
tipstaff or crier.

Some judicial assistants are assigned to the work directly with judges of the
Supreme Court, Court of Appeal, High Court and Circuit Court.

Assistants assigned to specific judges assist the judge with:

  * Research 
  * Preparing for cases 
  * Proof-reading 
  * Communicating with the parties to a case 

They also combine the role of judicial assistant with that of the traditional
tipstaff or crier.

There are still a small number of tipstaff who usually work with judges
appointed up to 2011.
