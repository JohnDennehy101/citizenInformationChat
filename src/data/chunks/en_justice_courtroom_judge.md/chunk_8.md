###  **Experience needed to become a judge**

Judges must have at least 10 years’ experience as a barrister or solicitor
before being appointed to the District Court and at least 12 years’ experience
before being appointed to the High Court, Court of Appeal or the Supreme
Court. Usually, they have many more years of experience before they are
appointed.
