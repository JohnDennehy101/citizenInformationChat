####  Step 2: Calculate the WFP rate

To get the [ Working Family Payment (WFP) ](/en/social-welfare/families-and-
children/working-family-payment/) , Mary’s average weekly income must be under
a certain amount for her family size. The maximum income limit for a family
with 3 children is €847.

The WFP payment she can get is 60% of the difference between her average
weekly family income, and the WFP income limit for her family size.

  * The difference between €847 and €698 is €149 
  * 60% of €149 is €89.40 

So, Mary will get a WFP rate of €89.40 each week.
