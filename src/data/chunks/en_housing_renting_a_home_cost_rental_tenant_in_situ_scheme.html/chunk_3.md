###  Separate scheme for people getting HAP or on RAS

There is a separate Tenant in Situ Scheme if you are getting the [ Housing
Assistance Payment ](/en/housing/renting-a-home/help-with-renting/housing-
assistance-payment/) or are on the [ Rental Accommodation Scheme
](/en/housing/local-authority-and-social-housing/rental-accommodation-scheme/)
and have a landlord who is selling the home you are renting. With this scheme,
the local authority can buy the home from the landlord and you can continue to
rent it from the local authority. You should contact your [ local authority
](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/942f74-local-authorities/) about this
scheme.
