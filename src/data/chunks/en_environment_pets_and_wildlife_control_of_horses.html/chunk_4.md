##  How do I get a horse passport in Ireland?

You can buy a horse passport from an [ approved Passport Issuing Organisation
(PIO) ](https://www.gov.ie/en/service/066fa-equine-passports-and-
microchips/#where-to-get-the-passport) . The passport lasts for the horses
lifetime.

The passport shows the:

  * Identity of the horse 
  * Microchip number (if it has one) 
  * Unique Equine Life Number (UELN) 

The passport will also say if the horse is to be farmed for horsemeat for
human consumption. This is because the horse cannot be given certain types of
medication if it will be farmed for horsemeat.

**You should not buy a horse that does not have a passport** .
