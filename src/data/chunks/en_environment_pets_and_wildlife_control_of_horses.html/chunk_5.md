###  **When do I get a horse passport?**

If your horse was born in the Republic of Ireland, you must get its passport
either:

  * Before the 31 December in the year it was born 
  * Within 6 months of the day it is born 

For example, a horse born in May, must have a passport by 31 December of that
year. A horse born in October must have a passport within 6 months, so this
means by April of the following year.

If you are taking a foal from the holding where it was born, it must be
microchipped and have a passport.

However, you will not need a passport for the foal if it is:

  * Under 12 months old 
  * Not yet weaned 
  * Accompanied by its mother (dam or foster mare) 

If you sell or give your horse to someone else, you must give the new owner
the passport and they must register the change of ownership with the
appropriate PIO.

If your horse is over 12 months old and does not have a passport, you can
still apply for one. However, this ‘late registration’ means you will only get
a duplicate or replacement passport. So, the horse can never be sold as
horsemeat in the food chain.
