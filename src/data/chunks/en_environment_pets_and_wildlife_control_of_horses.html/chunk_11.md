###  **Inspection and offences**

You must allow the Gardaí to inspect your horse if they ask to do so. You can
also be asked to show your horse licence. The Gardaí have extensive powers to
search and arrest if they suspect cruelty to horses.

You can be arrested without a warrant for most of these offences. If you are
found guilty, you can be fined or put in prison (or both) and you can be
banned from keeping a horse for some time.

The local authority may take and deal with the horse as they see fit.
