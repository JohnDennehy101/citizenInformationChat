##  What if I move?

If you are leaving a property, contact your electricity supplier to let them
know you are moving and give them a last meter reading so that they can send
you a final bill.

When you are moving into a house that was previously occupied and still has an
electricity connection, take a meter reading when you move in. Then, contact a
service supplier to set up a new account. If you are renting, your landlord
may have to contact the electricity supplier on your behalf.

If the house has been disconnected, you need to find out how long it has been
disconnected. To do this, contact ESBN and provide your MPRN or meter number.
If the disconnection has been:

  * **Less than 6 months -** You should register as a customer with an electricity supplier who will organise reconnection to the network with ESBN 
  * **Between 6 months and 2 years -** You should register as a customer with an electricity supplier and arrange for a registered electrical contractor to check the wiring and provide a [ certificate of completion to their approved regulatory body ](https://www.esbnetworks.ie/new-connections/certification-process) . When ESBN has received a verified certificate, your supplier can then arrange for reconnection. 
  * **More than 2 years â€“** Apply to ESBN for a new connection
