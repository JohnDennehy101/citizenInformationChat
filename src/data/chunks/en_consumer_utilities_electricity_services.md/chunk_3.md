##  Getting an electricity connection

If you are moving into a property that has never been connected before, or one
that has been disconnected for more than 2 years, you need to apply to an
electricity supplier for a domestic supply agreement. The CRU keeps a list of
licensed [ energy suppliers ](https://www.cru.ie/home/customer-
care/energy/communication/#list-of-energy-suppliers) .

When you have picked a supplier, contact ESBN and give the following
information:

  * Your name and contact details 
  * The [ Meter Point Reference Number (MPRN) ](https://www.esbnetworks.ie/existing-connections/meters-and-readings/how-to-find-your-mprn) and [ Maximum Import Capacity (MIC) ](https://www.esbnetworks.ie/help-centre/help-faq/find-out-more2/what-is-maximum-import-capacity-\(mic\)) for your new home â€“ available from the builder or developer 
  * The address of your home 
  * The name of your chosen electricity supplier 

Your supplier will then contact ESBN to ask that your electricity connection
is turned on. ESBN will also arrange for your meter to be installed. The
builder's electrician will switch on the electricity supply in your home.

ESBN has more information about [ electricity connections for a new single
house ](https://www.esbnetworks.ie/new-connections) and [ electricity
