##  Switching electricity supplier

If you are not happy with your current electricity supplier, you can switch
supplier. Check if you are in a fixed term contract. If you are, you may be
charged for switching to another supplier. As there are many suppliers to
choose from, it is important to do your research to find the best option to
suit your needs.

Before you switch:

  * Check your current bill to see what your usage is, the average amount you pay and how payment is taken 
  * Find out when your contract with your current supplier ends 
  * Use a price comparison website 
  * Try to renegotiate with your current supplier 
  * Make sure you have your MPRN number (located on your current bill) and an up-to-date meter reading for the new supplier 

The new supplier will notify the old supplier that you will be changing over.
