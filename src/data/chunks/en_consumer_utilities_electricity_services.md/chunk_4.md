##  Will I need to pay a security deposit?

Your electricity supplier is allowed to charge a deposit. Each supplier has
its own deposit policy, which must be fair, transparent and reasonable. The
deposit must be returned in the bill you get after your contract ends (your
contracted period is usually 12 months). Your supplier must tell you if you
are at risk of losing your deposit and describe the steps to take to improve
your credit terms.

If you are on a low income and cannot afford to pay a deposit, check if you
are eligible for [ help ](/en/social-welfare/supplementary-welfare-
schemes/supplementary-welfare-allowance-scheme/) from your local INTREO
office.
