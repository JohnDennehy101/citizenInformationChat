##  Introduction

You can choose which private company you want to supply your home with
electricity. Suppliers offer a range of services and deals and different
options on how to pay. Many energy suppliers provide both electricity and gas.

ESB Networks (ESBN) operates and maintains the electricity network. You need
to contact ESBN if you are connecting to the electricity grid for the first
time, or if you are disconnecting completely.

But in most cases, your day-to-day electricity needs will be met by your
electricity supplier.

This page explains how to connect to an electricity service or how to switch
suppliers. You can read more about [ paying your electricity bills
