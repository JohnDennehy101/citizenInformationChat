##  How to complain

If you have a problem, first contact either:

  * Your electricity supplier for issues around billing, account problems, marketing or advertising, or changing supplier 
  * ESB Networks for problems including a faulty meter, connection costs, emergencies, outages, or connection delays 

If you cannot sort out the problem informally, you can complain in writing to
either your supplier or the network provider.

If you are not satisfied with the response from the provider, you can:

  * Contact the CRU for information and advice, and if necessary, use its [ complaint resolution service ](https://www.cru.ie/home/complaint-form/energy/log-complaint-cru/)
  * Take a claim against the company through the courts using the [ Small Claims Procedure ](/en/justice/courts-system/small-claims-court/)
