##  How are AHBs regulated and what are their responsibilities?

Approved housing bodies are regulated by 2 organisations. The Approved Housing
Bodies Regulatory Authority (AHBRA) oversees the management and performance of
AHBs, ensuring that public investment in AHB housing is protected. The
Residential Tenancies Board (RTB) ensures that the rights and responsibilities
of AHB landlords and tenants are protected.
