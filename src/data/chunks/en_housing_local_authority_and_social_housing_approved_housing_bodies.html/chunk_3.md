##  What services do AHB's provide?

There are approximately 500 approved housing bodies in Ireland. They vary in
size and in the services that they provide. As well as providing affordable
rented housing, AHBs aim to encourage and promote community engagement and
development.

AHBs get government funding from local authorities to provide affordable
rented housing. They use this funding to:

  * Build new homes 
  * Buy existing homes 
  * Lease private homes 

Some AHBs were established by existing caring organisations to provide
services to specific groups, such as older people, people with disabilities or
homeless people. Some offer non-housing services, such as group meals, social
activities and welfare advice.

Some AHBs help people who want to return to live in Ireland. For example, [
Safe-Home Ireland ](https://safehomeireland.com/housing-assistance/) helps
older Irish-born emigrants living in rented accommodation abroad, who want to
return home, but cannot afford their own accommodation.
