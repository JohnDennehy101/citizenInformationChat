####  **Registering with the AHBRA**

The AHBRA took over responsibility for the AHB register on 1 January 2022.
Previously, the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage
maintained a register of AHBs. AHBs on the old register were automatically
transferred onto the new one and were ‘deemed registered’.

These AHBs [ still need to register directly with the AHBRA,
](https://www.ahbregulator.ie/registration/deemed-registered/) as there are
additional requirements to the new register. But, they have been given an
extended timeframe to do this. The length of time a ‘deemed registered AHB’ is
given to register with AHBRA depends on the number of homes they provide or
manage. You can find this information in the [ AHBRA’s Registration Policy
(pdf) ](https://www.ahbregulator.ie/app/uploads/2022/07/REGISTRATION-
POLICY.pdf) .

The AHBRA's [ registration process is slightly different for new AHBs
](https://www.ahbregulator.ie/registration/new-ahbs/) applying to register
with them.

All AHBs should contact the AHBRA to discuss their applications before
beginning the registration process. The AHBRA can give advice about the [
registration process ](https://www.ahbregulator.ie/registration/eligibility-
registration/) , eligibility criteria, application forms and information
requirements.
