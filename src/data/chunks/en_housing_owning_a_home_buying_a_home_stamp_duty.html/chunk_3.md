##  Who pays stamp duty?

“Residential property” includes houses, apartments and any site that is bought
with a connected agreement to build residential property on it.

  * If you buy a site in connection with (or as part of) an arrangement to build a house or apartment on it, then you must pay stamp duty at the **residential** property rate on the total of the site cost and the building cost 
  * If you buy a site with no connected arrangement to build a house or apartment on it, then you must pay stamp duty at the **non-residential** property rate 

There is [ information (pdf) ](http://www.revenue.ie/en/tax-
professionals/tdm/stamp-duty/stamp-duty-manual/part-01.pdf) on revenue.ie on
how large gardens, car parking spaces and marina berths are treated for stamp
duty purposes. [ You can also read more on revenue.ie about stamp duty on
