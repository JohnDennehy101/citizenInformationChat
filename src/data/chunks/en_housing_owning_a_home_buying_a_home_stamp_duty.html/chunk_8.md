###  Residential property

In general the stamp duty rate is based on property value. However, there is
an increased stamp duty rate of 10%, if you buy 10 or more residential houses
or duplexes at a time, or cumulatively in a year, see tables below.

**Residential stamp duty rate including purchases of less than 10 houses or
duplexes in a year:**

**Property value** |  **Rate**  
---|---  
Up to €1,000,000  |  1%   
Balance  |  2%   
  
**Residential stamp duty rate when buying 10 or more houses or duplexes in a
year:**

**Number of houses/duplexes in a year** |  **Rate**  
---|---  
10 or more  |  10% on the total amount   
  
This [ increased rate applies from 20 May 2021 ](https://www.gov.ie/en/press-
release/0b75f-minister-donohoe-announces-stamp-duty-measure-for-bulk-
purchasers-for-homes/) . However, houses and duplexes bought before 20 May
2021 can be counted towards the threshold of 10 units, but the higher rate
only applies to the units bought after this. For example, if you bought 6
houses in April 2021 and 5 houses in June 2021, the April purchases mean that
you have reached the threshold of 10 houses in a year, but the higher stamp
duty rate is only charged on the houses bought in June.

This increased rate does not apply when buying apartments, and does not affect
local authorities and approved housing bodies.

You can [ claim a refund ](https://www.revenue.ie/en/property/stamp-
duty/claiming-a-stamp-duty-refund/social-housing/index.aspx) if you pay the
increased rate of stamp duty, but then decide to lease the properties to a
local authority or approved housing body for social housing. The refund is the
difference between the standard rate and the increased rate. To qualify for
this refund you must:

  * Lease the properties to the local authority or approved housing body within two years of buying them 
  * Lease the properties for at least ten years 

**Exceptions**

If you are buying your home under the [ local authority tenant purchase
](/en/housing/local-authority-and-social-housing/buying-or-inheriting-a-local-
authority-home/) scheme, a maximum amount of €100 is charged in stamp duty.

There is no stamp duty payable on certain transfers between spouses, civil
partners and cohabitants – see above.

If you paid VAT on your house, you only have to pay stamp duty on the base
price of the house – before the VAT was added. So, for example, if you paid
€454,000 (including VAT) for your new house, this is made up of the base price
of €400,000 plus 13.5% VAT (€54,000) and you only pay stamp duty on the base
price of €400,000. Read more in [ our document on Value Added Tax ](/en/money-
