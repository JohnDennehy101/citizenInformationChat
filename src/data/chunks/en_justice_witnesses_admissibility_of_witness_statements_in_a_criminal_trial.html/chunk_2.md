##  Introduction

When the Gardai investigate a crime they will ask witnesses to describe what
they saw or heard. They will write down what they say and this is called a
‘witness statement’. If the suspect is charged and brought to court, the
prosecution will rely on those witnesses to give evidence to support their
case.

Sometimes a person who made a witness statement might refuse to give evidence
in court, or what they say when they appear in court might be different from
what they said in their earlier statement. Section 16 of [ The Criminal
Justice Act 2006 (pdf)
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2006/act/26/enacted/en/pdf) regulates
what can be done in these situations.
