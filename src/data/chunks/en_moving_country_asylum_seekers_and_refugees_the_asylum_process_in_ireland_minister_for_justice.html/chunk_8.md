The Minister must notify you of their intention to revoke your declaration.
You then have 15 working days from the issue of the notification to make
representations to the Minister.

Where the Minister decides to revoke a declaration, you have 10 working days
from the sending of the notice containing the decision and the reasons for it
to appeal to the Circuit Court.
