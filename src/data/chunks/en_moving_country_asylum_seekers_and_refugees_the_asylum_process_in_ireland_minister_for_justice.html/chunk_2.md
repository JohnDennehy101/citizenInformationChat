##  Introduction

After your [ application for international protection ](/en/moving-
country/asylum-seekers-and-refugees/the-asylum-process-in-ireland/applying-
for-refugee-status-in-ireland/) has been examined, the International
Protection Office sends its recommendation to the Minister for Justice. This
is also called the ‘first instance decision’. The IPO makes one of the
following recommendations:

  * That you should be declared a [ refugee ](/en/moving-country/asylum-seekers-and-refugees/the-asylum-process-in-ireland/refugees-asylum-seekers-introduction#lad40a)
  * That you should be declared a person with [ subsidiary protection ](/en/moving-country/asylum-seekers-and-refugees/the-asylum-process-in-ireland/refugees-asylum-seekers-introduction#l50016)
  * That you should not be declared either a refugee or a person with subsidiary protection 

You can [ appeal the recommendation of the IPO ](/en/moving-country/asylum-
seekers-and-refugees/the-asylum-process-in-ireland/if-your-application-for-
refugee-status-is-refused/) if it has not granted you a refugee or subsidiary
protection declaration to the International Protection Appeals Tribunal. If
you do not appeal, or your appeal is not successful, the Minister will decide
if you should be granted [ permission to remain in Ireland ](/en/moving-
country/asylum-seekers-and-refugees/refugee-status-and-leave-to-
remain/permission-to-remain/) or not.

The Minister will usually follow the recommendation of the IPO or the
International Protection Appeals Tribunal (IPAT) to grant or refuse you a
refugee or subsidiary protection declaration. The Minister can refuse you a
refugee protection declaration at this stage if:

  * There are reasonable grounds for regarding you as a danger to the security of Ireland 
  * You have been convicted (either in Ireland or another country) of a serious crime and you constitute a danger to the community 
  * Your application for international protection was [ withdrawn ](/en/moving-country/asylum-seekers-and-refugees/the-asylum-process-in-ireland/withdrawing-from-the-asylum-process-in-ireland/)
