###  **How does the scheme work?**

When calculating your State Pension (Contributory), the Department of Social
Protection (DSP) looks at your social insurance record.

If you spent time out of work caring for someone, the DSP can add a 'Home
Caring Period' to your social insurance record. See ‘Do I qualify for the
HomeCaring Periods Scheme’ below.

You can get up to 1,040 HomeCaring Periods (equivalent to 20 years’
employment) included on your social insurance record.

You can’t qualify for this scheme and the [ Homemaker's Scheme
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-
system/social-insurance-prsi/homemakers-scheme/) at the same time, as each
scheme calculates your pension entitlement in different ways.
