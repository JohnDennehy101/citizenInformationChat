###  **Fewer than 2,080 contributions, even with HomeCaring Periods**

If your combined total of paid contributions, HomeCaring Periods, and credited
contributions is less than 2,080, you will qualify for [ a reduced rate of
pension ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/older-and-
retired-people/state-pension-contributory/#93671b) .

For example:

Mary has a combined total of 1,560 of paid contributions, made up of
HomeCaring Periods and credited contributions.

1,560 (Mary’s total contributions) ÷ 2,080 (the maximum number of
contributions) = 75%

So, Mary’s rate of State Pension (Contributory) will be 75% of the maximum
rate.
