####  **If you are in a couple**

If you are married, in a civil partnership or cohabiting and have a combined
gross household income of €90,000 or less, you will get 100% of the amount
allowable.

For each whole €1,000 of household income above €90,000, you will be required
to make a 1% contribution to the amount allowable.

For example, if you are:

  * Married, in a civil partnership or cohabiting, and 
  * Have a combined gross household income of €105,000 

You will get 85% of the amount allowable (€15,000 over the income limit of
€90,000 = 15% personal contribution to the loss).
