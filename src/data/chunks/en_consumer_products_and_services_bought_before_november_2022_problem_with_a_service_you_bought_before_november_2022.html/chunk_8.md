###  Can I withhold money if I am not happy with the service **?**

It can be tempting to withhold money to help with negotiations where you are
in dispute with a service supplier. However, withholding money could put you
in breach of your contract.

A service supplier can:

  * Use a collection agency to collect outstanding payments on their behalf 
  * Take legal action against you and you would be in a weaker position if you wanted to take your dispute further
