##  Do you have a written contract?

Contracts can be written or verbal and are made up of terms; some of which can
be _implied_ _terms_ . Implied terms are not mentioned but are automatically
part of a contract because of protections under consumer legislation.

Contracts differ in many ways and there are no hard and fast rules for what
terms should be in a consumer contract. However, terms in consumer contracts
must always be fair and made clear to you.

While a verbal agreement is as legally binding as a written contract, it is a
good idea to have a written agreement to protect you and avoid disagreements
later on.

At a minimum, the agreement should describe:

  * What services will be supplied 
  * Timings to complete the work 
  * The price and the payment schedule 
  * Any other important aspects
