###  I have been misled by the service provider

You have the right to receive accurate and truthful information about
services. A service supplier is not allowed to mislead you to convince you to
hire them.

You can cancel the contract if:

  * You were misled or deceived by claims made by the service supplier 
  * The service supplier misled you about an essential term or condition in the contract (including quotations and other promises about timescales or about the results to be achieved) 

Some examples of misleading claims include:

  * The service has uses or benefits that it does not have 
  * The service is of a particular standard or quality when it is not 
  * The service supplier has an approval, status or professional designation that they do not have 
  * You are getting a special price or benefit when they are really offering the same thing that you can get somewhere else
