###  I am not happy with the standard of work done

To avoid problems, raise any concerns that you have as the work progresses.
Where possible, be available for the trader to contact you so that they can
raise any issues that come up.

If you are not satisfied with the quality of goods or services you should:

  * Act as soon as you can â€“ a delay can indicate that you have accepted faulty services 
  * Do not attempt to repair what went wrong yourself or give it to anyone else to repair it 
  * Make sure that you have a proof of purchase (a receipt, cheque stub, credit card statement or invoice) 
  * Keep all evidence of damage caused by poor work, for example take photos 

Some service suppliers offer a warranty or guarantee for the service they
provide. This is their promise about the quality of their services and what
they will do if there are problems. Check any warranty or guarantee to see if
it covers the problem.

If you are in dispute with the service supplier about whether the work is of
poor quality, look for an independent third-party opinion.
