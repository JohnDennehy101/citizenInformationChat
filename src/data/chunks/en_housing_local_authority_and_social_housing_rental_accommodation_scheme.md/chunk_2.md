##  What is the Rental Accommodation Scheme?

If you are getting [ Rent Supplement ](/en/social-welfare/supplementary-
welfare-schemes/rent-supplement/) for a long period and you are in need of
long-term housing, you may qualify for the Rental Accommodation Scheme (RAS).
The scheme is run by local authorities.

The local authority makes the final decision about who qualifies for the
scheme. In general, people who are getting Rent Supplement for more than 18
months are considered for RAS.

The main difference between RAS and Rent Supplement is that you can get a
full-time job and can stay in the RAS scheme, with a recalculated rent.

The [ Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) ](/en/housing/renting-a-home/help-with-
renting/housing-assistance-payment/) will eventually replace RAS. However, you
cannot transfer from RAS to HAP.
