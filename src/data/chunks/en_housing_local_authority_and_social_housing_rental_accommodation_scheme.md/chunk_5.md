###  If your landlord plans to sell

Under RAS, your landlord signs a contract with the local authority to provide
housing for an agreed amount of time. However, if your landlord decides to
sell their property, they can terminate the contract.

RAS tenancies are covered by residential tenancies legislation, so your
landlord must follow the normal rules when terminating the tenancy.

Read about these rules in our page [ if your landlord wants you to leave
](/en/housing/renting-a-home/tenants-rights-and-responsibilities/if-your-
landlord-wants-you-to-leave/) .
