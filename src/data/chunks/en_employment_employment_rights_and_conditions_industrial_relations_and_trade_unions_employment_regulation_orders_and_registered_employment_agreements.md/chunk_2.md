##  What are employment agreements and orders?

Employees in a particular sector (such as construction or security), and
workers who are represented by a trade union, sometimes have their working
conditions set out in a particular _employment agreement_ or _employment
order_ .

Type of employment agreement or order  |  What it means for you   
---|---  
[ Employment Regulation Order ](https://www.workplacerelations.ie/en/what_you_should_know/hours-and-wages/employment%20regulation%20orders/) (ERO)  |  An ERO sets the minimum rates of pay and conditions for workers in a specified business sector.  The order is drawn up by a [ Joint Labour Committee ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/employment/employment-rights-and-conditions/industrial-relations-and-trade-unions/joint-labour-committees/) and signed into law by the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  Read more about EROs below.   
[ Registered Employment Agreement ](https://www.workplacerelations.ie/en/what_you_should_know/hours-and-wages/registered%20employment%20agreements/) (REA)  |  An REA is a collective agreement between a trade union and an employer. It covers the pay or employment conditions of specified workers.  An REA is registered with the Labour Court and is only binding on the parties that subscribed to it (such as the worker, employer and trade union).  Read more about REAs below.   
[ Sectoral Employment Order ](https://www.workplacerelations.ie/en/what_you_should_know/hours-and-wages/sectoral%20employment%20orders/) (SEO)  |  An SEO is made following a recommendation from the Labour Court on pay, pension or sick pay scheme for workers in a particular sector.  When the Minister signs an SEO, the Labour Courtâ€™s recommendations become law.  Read more about SEOs below.   
  
If you are covered by an employment agreement or order, the details may be
included in your [ contract of employment ](/en/employment/employment-rights-
and-conditions/contracts-of-employment/contract-of-employment/) .
