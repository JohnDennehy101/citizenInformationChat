##  Supporting someone bereaved by suicide

If you are supporting someone who has been bereaved by suicide, it is
important to be extremely sensitive to the needs of the bereaved person. Each
situation involving suicide is different and people react in different ways.

It is also important to be mindful of your own mental wellbeing while offering
support to the bereaved. The organisations listed below can help, particularly
if a time comes when you can no longer offer the level of support needed.

These organisations can offer you advice, information and support during this
very distressing time. Some organisations run support groups that can put you
in touch with other people that have been through this experience.
