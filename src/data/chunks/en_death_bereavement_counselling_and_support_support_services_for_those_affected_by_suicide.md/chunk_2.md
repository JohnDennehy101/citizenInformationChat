##  Immediate aftermath

If you are bereaved by suicide, you may experience a range of emotions
including shock, disbelief, guilt, and anger. As suicide may occur
unexpectedly or be very sudden, this makes it traumatic for those left behind.

Some people bereaved by suicide may start to have suicidal thoughts
themselves. If you or somebody you know who has been bereaved by suicide
experience this, please reach out for help to a family member or friend, or to
one of the organisations listed below.
