###  Capable of work

You must be capable of work to qualify for a jobseekerâ€™s payment. You are
considered capable of work unless you can produce medical evidence to prove
that you are not able to work. If you have spent some time incapable of work,
you must produce a final medical certificate to prove that you are now fit for
work.

If you are ill and incapable of work, you may be entitled to [ Disability
Allowance ](/en/social-welfare/disability-and-illness/disability-allowance/)
or [ Illness Benefit ](/en/social-welfare/disability-and-illness/illness-
benefit/) . If you are pregnant, you are considered to be capable of work
unless you have complications during your pregnancy or you are ill. You can

welfare/families-and-children/pregnancy-and-social-welfare-payments/) .
