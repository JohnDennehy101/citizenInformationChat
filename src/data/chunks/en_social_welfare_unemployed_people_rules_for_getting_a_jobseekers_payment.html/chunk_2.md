##  Jobseeker’s payments

[ Jobseeker’s Benefit ](/en/social-welfare/unemployed-people/jobseekers-

people/jobseekers-allowance/) are payments for people who are unemployed and
looking for work.

To get Jobseeker’s Benefit (JB), you must have enough social insurance (PRSI)
contributions. To get Jobseeker’s Allowance (JA), you must pass a means test.
You can find out more about [ the difference between JB and JA ](/en/social-

work, available for work and looking for full-time work or your payment can be
reduced or stopped.
