##  Sanctions for not meeting the jobseeker’spayment rules

You can be _refused_ a jobseeker’s payment if you do not meet all the rules
that apply to the payment. You can be _disqualified_ from a payment for a
period of time in certain circumstances. You can also have your _payment
reduced_ (and subsequently stopped altogether for a period of time) if you do
not attend meetings or participate in appropriate employment schemes, training
or work experience.
