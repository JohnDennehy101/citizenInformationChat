###  Reduction in payment

Depending on your personal profile, you may be given an appointment for a
further meeting with a DSP Case Officer. At this meeting your Case Officer
will discuss your options with you and agree your Personal Progression Plan to
prepare you to find employment. You will get ongoing advice and support to
help you meet the goals in your Personal Progression Plan. You can read about
the [ employment services the Department of Social Protection offers to
jobseekers ](/en/social-welfare/unemployed-people/employment-supports/) .

If you do not keep to the other conditions of your jobseeker’s payment, your
payment can be reduced and eventually stopped altogether.

You can be paid a _penalty rate_ of JA or JB if you do not:

  * Attend meetings requested by the DSP or 
  * Participate in an appropriate employment support scheme, work experience or training 

If you have been placed on a penalty rate and you continue not to meet the
rules, you can be disqualified from your jobseeker’s payment for up to 9
weeks. You cannot be disqualified immediately – a penalty rate must apply
first for at least 21 days.
