###  Voluntary work

You may be able to do voluntary work and continue to get a jobseekerâ€™s
payment. You must continue to satisfy the conditions of the payment, which
means that you must be available and looking for full-time work. You must also
get permission from a Deciding Officer at your Intreo Centre or Social Welfare
Branch Office. Find out more about [ voluntary work and social welfare
