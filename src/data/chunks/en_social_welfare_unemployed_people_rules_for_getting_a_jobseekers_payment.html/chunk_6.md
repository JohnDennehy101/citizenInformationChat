###  Retained firefighters and jobseeker’s payments

If you are employed as a part-time retained firefighter, you may qualify for a
jobseeker’s payment. If you are working as a part-time fire fighter, you do
not have to sign off for the days you are on call, firefighting or training.
This means that you can be paid a jobseeker’s payment for days that you are on
call, firefighting, or training.

Retained firefighters must live within 2.4 kilometres (1.5 miles) of the fire
station and commit to being ready for firefighting duties in 5 minutes. This
requirement is not considered a restriction on your availability for work, so
long as you are satisfying the conditions of the scheme. You have to be
available for full-time work and you must not restrict your search for
employment to the 2.4km limit.

If you are getting Jobseeker’s Allowance, the income you get will be assessed
in the normal way and any means will be set against your payment.

If you had a previous Jobseeker’s Benefit claim, you can requalify for JB once
you pay 13 PRSI contributions and you meet all the other conditions. The
substantial loss condition does not apply to the employment as a firefighter.
However, if you have other employment, then the substantial loss condition
applies to that other employment.
