###  Genuinely looking for work

You must also show that you are genuinely looking for work. A day is not
treated as a day of unemployment unless on that day you are genuinely seeking
suitable full-time work. If you are in part-time employment and getting a
jobseeker's payment, you must show that you are trying to get full-time
employment on the days you are not working.

You must be able to show that you are making genuine efforts to secure
employment. You need to provide examples seeking work. Steps which show that
you are genuinely seeking work may include:

  * Making oral or written applications for work 
  * Looking for information on the availability of employment from employers, advertisements, and employment agencies 
  * Taking up reasonable training opportunities 
  * Acting on the advice given by a DSP Case Officer or other placement agency, such as the Local Employment Service (LES) 
  * Taking positive, well-advised steps towards establishing yourself in self-employment, such as researching possible areas of self-employment 
  * Preparing business plans for a self-employment project 
  * Attending relevant "start your own business" courses or seeking information, advice or guidance in relation to any of these steps
