###  Rights of mothers

The child of a female prisoner can be taken into the prison to facilitate
breast feeding, until the child is 12 months of age. The child may not be
taken from its mother until the medical officer certifies that it is in a fit
condition to be removed.

Except in special circumstances, the child will not be kept in the prison
after it is 12 months old.

Before taking a child out of prison, the governor must consult with the
childâ€™s mother and the [ Child and Family Agency ](http://www.tusla.ie/) as to
the appropriate placement for the child.
