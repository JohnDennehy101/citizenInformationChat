###  Social welfare payments

To qualify for a social welfare payment, you must meet the rules for the
payment. In general, social welfare is not paid while you are in prison
because you cannot satisfy one or more of the rules. For example, to get
Jobseekerâ€™s Allowance, you must be available for work.
