###  Right to freedom of religion

You do have a right to practise your religion. The prison will provide for
basic religious needs but you do not have a right to special requirements.

When you arrive in prison, you will state your religious denomination and if
there is no service provided in the prison for your denomination, the prison
will allow a religious instructor to visit you.
