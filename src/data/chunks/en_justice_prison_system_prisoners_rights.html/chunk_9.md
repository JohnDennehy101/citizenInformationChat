###  Right to sanitation and washing facilities

You do not have an absolute right to in cell sanitation and washing
facilities. However, if it is possible, adequate sanitary and washing
facilities should be provided in your cell or room. Where this is not
possible, you must have reasonable access to sanitary and washing facilities.
