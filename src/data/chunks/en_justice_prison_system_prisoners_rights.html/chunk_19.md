###  Rights relating to searches and drug testing

You may be searched and you may only be searched by officers of the same sex.
The search must be done with due regard to your decency and self-respect and
in as appropriate a manner as possible. At no stage should you be left
completely naked.

You might have to give a hair, urine or saliva sample for the purpose of
detecting the presence or use of alcohol, a controlled drug or a medicinal
product.

A search can only be carried out for a genuine purpose, for example, to find
forbidden items. A search cannot be carried out simply to harass you.
