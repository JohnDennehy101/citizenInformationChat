###  M50

The M50 operates a barrier-free tolling scheme called eFlow. This allows all
motorists to pass through the toll at motorway speed. There are a few ways you
can pay the tolls, including using an electronic tag from eFlow or another
supplier. Charges vary depending on the method used. You cannot pay the toll
with cash at the M50, but the toll must be paid by 8pm the next day. You can
find out more about the toll scheme at [ eflow.ie
