###  Neglect

Neglect occurs when a child does not get proper care or supervision to the
extent that the child is harmed physically or developmentally. Ongoing neglect
is recognised as being extremely harmful to the development and well-being of
a child and may have serious long-term negative consequences.

Some of the features of child neglect include:

  * Children being left alone without adequate care and supervision 
  * Malnourishment, lacking food, unsuitable food or erratic feeding 
  * Failure to provide adequate care for the child’s medical and developmental needs 
  * Inadequate living conditions – unhygienic conditions, environmental issues, including lack of adequate heating and furniture 
  * Lack of adequate clothing 
  * Inattention to basic hygiene 
  * Lack of protection and exposure to danger or lack of supervision appropriate to the child’s age 
  * Persistent failure to attend school
