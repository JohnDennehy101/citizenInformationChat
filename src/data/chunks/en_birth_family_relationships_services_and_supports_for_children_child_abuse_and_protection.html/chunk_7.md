###  Sexual abuse

Sexual abuse occurs where a child is used by someone for their own or someone
else’s sexual gratification or arousal. It includes the child being involved
in sexual acts or exposing the child to sexual activity directly or through
pornography.

Examples of child sexual abuse include:

  * Any sexual act intentionally performed in the presence of a child 
  * Sexual intercourse with a child 
  * Sexual exploitation of a child including inviting, coercing or inducing a child to participate in, or to observe any sexual, indecent or obscene act 
  * Showing sexually explicit material to children, which is often a feature of the ‘grooming’ process by perpetrators of abuse 
  * Consensual sexual activity involving an adult and an underage person (in criminal law the age of consent to sexual intercourse is 17 years for both boys and girls)
