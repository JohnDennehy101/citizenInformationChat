###  Are parents informed if concerns are reported?

If you are the parent of a child being assessed following the reporting of
concerns, you should be told why and you should be given the opportunity to
respond. Concerns about your child should be explained to you.

Tusla has published information for parents in their leaflet on [ social work
assessment of child protection and welfare concerns (pdf)

work (pdf) ](https://www.tusla.ie/uploads/content/Signs_Parents_sos_leaflet_-
