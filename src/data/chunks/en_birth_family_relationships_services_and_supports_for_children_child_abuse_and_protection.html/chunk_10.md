##  What happens after a report is received by Tusla?

Tusla will consider your report, and if concerns are found after the initial
checks, further evaluation involving a detailed examination of the child and
family’s circumstances will follow. It will then take whatever action is
required to protect the child.

If no concerns are found, then the information gathered is recorded and kept
on a confidential file where it will be examined if further concerns or more
information comes to light.

If you need to report your concerns outside normal office hours (weekends and
at night) you should report your concerns to the [ Garda Síochána
](/en/justice/law-enforcement/garda-siochana-national-police-force/) .

Under the [ Protections for Persons Reporting Child Abuse Act 1998
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1998/act/49/enacted/en/html) , as long as
you report what you believe to be true and you do it in good faith you, cannot
be sued for making a false or malicious report.

If you make a report about a child, Tusla will normally acknowledge it, and
may contact you for further information, if necessary. It is understandable
that you would like to be assured that the matter is being followed up.
However, to protect the privacy of the child and family, it may not be
possible for Tusla to inform you of the progress or outcome of Tusla’s contact
with the child or family.
