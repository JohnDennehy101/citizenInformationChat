###  Conciliation Service

The Conciliation Service helps employers and their employees to resolve
disputes when they have failed to reach agreement during their own previous
negotiations.

A WRC Industrial Relations Officer acts as chairperson during meetings to
negotiate an agreement. The majority of the cases referred to conciliation are
settled. If no agreement is reached, the parties can refer the dispute to the
[ Labour Court ](https://www.labourcourt.ie/en/) .
