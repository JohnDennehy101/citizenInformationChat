##  How do you recognise child abuse?

You may have observed signs of abuse or have grounds for concern such as,
where a child has a suspicious injury or appears distressed for no obvious
reason. If you ignore what may be signs or symptoms of abuse, it could result
in ongoing harm to the child.

Alternatively, a child may make a direct or indirect disclosure. A child needs
to have someone they can trust in order to feel able to disclose abuse they
may be experiencing. They need to know that they will be believed and will get
the help they need.

The Child and Family Agency (Tusla) provides more information on the [ types
of child abuse on its website and how to recognise them
](https://www.tusla.ie/children-first/parents-and-guardians/what-are-the-
types-of-abuse-and-how-do-i-recognise-them/) . You should always inform Tusla
if you are concerned that a child may have been, is being, or is at risk of
being abused or neglected.

If you are concerned about a child but unsure whether you should report it to
Tusla, you may find it useful to contact Tusla to informally discuss your
concern.

It is not necessary for you to prove that abuse has occurred to report a
concern to the [ Child and Family Agency (Tusla) ](https://www.tusla.ie/) .
All that is required is that you have **reasonable grounds for concern** . It
is Tuslaâ€™s role to assess concerns that are reported to it.
