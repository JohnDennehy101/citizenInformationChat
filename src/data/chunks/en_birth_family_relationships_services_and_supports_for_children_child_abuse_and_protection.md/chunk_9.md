##  How do I report my concerns?

Tusla has a statutory responsibility to assess all reports of child welfare
and protection concerns. Anyone who suspects that a child is being abused, or
is at risk of abuse, has a duty to report their suspicions to Tusla. You
should report your concerns to the Tusla [ social work duty officer in the
area the child lives ](https://www.tusla.ie/children-first/contact-a-social-
worker3/) .

You can report your concerns in person, by writing or by phone. While you can
report your concerns anonymously, Tusla does not normally reveal the names of
people who report suspicions of child abuse unless they have permission to do
so.
