##  Introduction

It is everyoneâ€™s responsibility to protect children and young people and keep
them safe. It is important that families, communities and professionals can
recognise when a child or young person is being harmed and that they know what
action to take in response.

The purpose of the [ Children First Act 2015
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2015/act/36/enacted/en/print.html) and
the [ Children First: National Guidance for the Protection and Welfare of
Children (pdf)
](https://www.tusla.ie/uploads/content/Children_First_National_Guidance_2017.pdf)
is to raise awareness of child abuse and neglect, provide for mandatory
reporting by key professionals and improve child safeguarding arrangements in
organisations providing services to children.
