###  Physical abuse

Physical abuse is when someone deliberately hurts a child physically or puts
them at risk of being physically hurt. It may occur as a single incident or as
a pattern of incidents.

Examples of physical abuse include:

  * Beating, slapping, hitting or kicking 
  * Pushing, shaking or throwing 
  * Use of excessive force in handling 
  * Deliberate poisoning 
  * Fabricated/induced illness 
  * Female genital mutilation 

The Children First Act 2015 abolishes the common law defence of reasonable
chastisement in court proceedings. This defence could previously be used by a
parent or other person in authority who physically disciplined a child.
