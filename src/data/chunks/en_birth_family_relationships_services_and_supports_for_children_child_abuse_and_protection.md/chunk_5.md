###  Emotional abuse

Emotional abuse occurs where a child’s need for affection, approval and
security is not being met by the child’s parents or carer. Emotional abuse is
not easy to recognise because the effects are not easily seen. The effects of
emotional abuse on a child may be shown through the child’s behaviour,
emotional state or development.

Emotional abuse of a child may include:

  * Rejection 
  * Lack of comfort and love 
  * Lack of continuity of care (for example, frequent moves, particularly unplanned) 
  * Continuous lack of praise and encouragement 
  * Persistent criticism, sarcasm, hostility or blaming of the child 
  * Bullying 
  * Conditional parenting in which care or affection of a child depends on his or her behaviours or actions 
  * Extreme overprotectiveness 
  * Inappropriate non-physical punishment (for example, locking a child in bedroom) 
  * Ongoing family conflicts and family violence 
  * Seriously inappropriate expectations of a child relative to their age and stage of development
