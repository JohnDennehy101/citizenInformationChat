##  Visas and borders in the Schengen Area

There are no border checks between the Schengen countries. You only pass
through border checks at the external border of the Schengen Area.

The [ Visa Information System (VIS) ](https://ec.europa.eu/home-affairs/what-
we-do/policies/borders-and-visas/visa-information-system) allows Schengen
member states to share visa information. Each Schengen country has the same
rules about entry and short stay visas.

If you are not a citizen of an EEA member state (the EU plus Iceland, Norway
and Liechtenstein), you may need a [ visa to travel to Ireland ](/en/moving-
country/visas-for-ireland/visa-requirements-for-entering-ireland/) , even if
you have a Schengen visa.

If you are a non-EEA citizen and you currently live in Ireland, you may need a
Schengen visa to travel to the Schengen Area, even if you have a valid Irish
Residence Permit (IRP). You should check with the [ embassy of the country you
plan to visit. ](https://www.ireland.ie/en/dfa/embassies-in-ireland/)
