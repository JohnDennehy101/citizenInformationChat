###  Free movement of people

The Schengen Agreement does not affect the rights of EEA citizens to live and
work in other EEA countries. This is covered by EU directives and regulations
on the [ free movement of people ](/en/government-in-ireland/european-
government/european-union/freedom-of-movement-in-the-eu/) .

You should note that many countries in the EEA require their own citizens and
visitors to carry some form of identification. You should carry your passport
or national identity card as you could be asked to prove that you have a legal
right to be in the Schengen Area.
