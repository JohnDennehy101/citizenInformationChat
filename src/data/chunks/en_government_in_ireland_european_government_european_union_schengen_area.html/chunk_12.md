###  Asylum Seekers

[ Asylum seekers ](/en/moving-country/asylum-seekers-and-refugees/the-asylum-
process-in-ireland/rights-and-obligations-of-asylum-seekers-in-ireland/)
cannot move freely within the Schengen Area. This is because they must stay in
the country where they have lodged their application for international
protection. The [ Dublin III Regulations ](/en/moving-country/asylum-seekers-
and-refugees/the-asylum-process-in-ireland/dublin-convention/) set out the
rules on where a claim for international protection asylum should be made
within the European Union.
