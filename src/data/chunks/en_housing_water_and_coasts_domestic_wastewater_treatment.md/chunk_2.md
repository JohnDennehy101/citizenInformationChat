##  Introduction

Domestic waste water treatment systems, such as septic tanks, collect, treat
and discharge waste water from households that are not connected to public
sewer systems.

If you have one of these systems, you must register it. It can be inspected by
a local authority to prevent any risk to the public and the environment.
