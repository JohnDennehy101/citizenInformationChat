###  **Different types of grants**

There are 3 different waste water treatment grant schemes. One [ grant (pdf)
](https://assets.gov.ie/111081/3750f7d4-d44d-4e9c-aaec-938f33cd8cbc.pdf) is
available for people to upgrade or repair their system following an
inspection. While the other 2 grants are only available if you live in a
particular area, and are notified by your local authority that you are
eligible to apply.

Find out more about the [ criteria for each of the schemes

You cannot get a grant for the routine maintenance, servicing or de-sludging
of a treatment system.
