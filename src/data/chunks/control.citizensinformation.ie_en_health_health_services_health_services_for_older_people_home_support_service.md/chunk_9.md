###  What is the Care Needs Assessment?

When you apply, the HSE will assess your health care needs and social
circumstances. The assessment will identify the level of care that you
currently receive and what other supports you may need.

The assessment will be done by a healthcare professional such as a public
health nurse or physiotherapist.

The HSE will write to you to let you know what decision is made about the
supports you need.

If you are not satisfied with the decision, you can write to the HSE Home
Support Office in your area to state this and your reasons. You can do this
within 20 days of receiving the decision. An impartial review of the decision
will be undertaken and you will be informed of the outcome of this review.
