####  Note 3 **  
**

You pay [ PRSI ](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/social-
insurance-prsi/social-insurance/) on income from your work only, not on your
One-Parent Family Payment. If you earn less than €352 a week you do not pay
any PRSI. You only pay PRSI for the weeks you work.

**Note 4**

You pay [ income tax (PAYE) ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/money-and-
tax/tax/income-tax/how-your-tax-is-calculated/#354b71) on all your income:
that is your gross weekly income (see **Step 2** **above** ).

To calculate how much income tax you pay each week, multiply your gross weekly
income by 20% to get the gross amount of income tax payable each week.

Total gross income by 20% €_______  
**Less** Weekly Tax Credit (see below for calculation)

**Total** income tax paid each week €______

Note that in practice your OFP payment is coded in against your tax credits
and rate band by Revenue - this worksheet simply shows you how to work out how
income from work will affect your OFP.

The amount that you can earn before you start to pay the higher rate of tax
(40%) is known as your [ standard rate cut-off point
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/money-and-tax/tax/income-tax/how-your-
tax-is-calculated/#354b71) . You can see [ examples of how to calculate income
tax ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/money-and-tax/tax/income-tax/case-
study-calculating-your-income-tax-case-studies/) using these tax rates and the
standard rate cut-off point.
