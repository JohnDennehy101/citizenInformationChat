##  How much is the Rent Tax Credit?

The amount of the credit is 20% of your rent payments in the year, up to a
maximum credit of:

  * €750 for an individual 
  * €1,500 for a couple who are [ jointly assessed for tax ](../income_tax/taxation_of_married_people.en.html#l83f01)

If a smaller amount would reduce your income tax to zero, that amount is the
maximum credit you can get.

For 2022 and 2023, the credit was €500 for an individual and €1,000 for a
couple.

If a number of tenants pay the rent for a property, each individual or couple
can claim the Rent Tax Credit for the rent they pay.

You cannot claim for payments for:

  * A security deposit 
  * Repairs or maintenance 
  * Board, laundry, utilities or other services
