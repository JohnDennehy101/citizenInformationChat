##  Removal of guardianship rights

Fathers and others who have been appointed joint guardians by a court or by
statutory declaration can be removed from their position if the court is
satisfied it is in the child's best interest. The only way a mother can give
up her guardianship rights in Ireland, is if the child is placed for adoption.
