###  Temporary guardianship

Temporary guardianship can be given to allow another adult, known as the
nominated person, to care for your child or children if you become seriously
unwell or need be hospitalised. The nominated person must be a suitable person
over 18 years old.

You need to complete a [ special form to nominate a temporary guardian (pdf)
](https://www.treoir.ie/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/nomination-form.pdf) , in
which you can set out your wishes on any limitations on the temporary
guardian. The nominated person must then apply to the court if you cannot
carry out your parental role due to serious illness. Exactly what the
temporary guardian’s rights are will be set out in the District Court’s Order,
which will usually be identical to the wishes you set out in the form.

If the court appoints a guardian to a child where one or both parents are
alive, the guardian will not generally have the right to make certain major
decisions about the child unless that right is expressly granted by the court.
