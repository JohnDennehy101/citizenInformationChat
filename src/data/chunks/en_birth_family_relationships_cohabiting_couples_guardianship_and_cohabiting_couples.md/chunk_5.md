##  Testamentary guardianship

A guardian of a child (especially if you are a sole guardian) should make a
will, appointing a testamentary guardian to act on your behalf in the event of
your death. It is strongly advised that you talk this over with someone who
could act as guardian and that they give their consent to being named in your
will as testamentary guardian.

The child's surviving guardian (if there is one) will then act jointly with
the new guardian. A surviving guardian can apply to have the appointment of a
testamentary guardian revoked. Read more in our document about [ making a will
