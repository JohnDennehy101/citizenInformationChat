##  Guardianship decided by the courts

The father has automatic joint guardianship if he has lived with the child's
mother for 12 consecutive months including at least 3 months with the mother
and child following the child's birth. If the mother disputes the amount of
time spent cohabiting or does not agree to sign the statutory declaration, the
other parent must apply to the court to be appointed as a joint guardian. You
do not require legal representation to do this, you can make the application
on your own behalf. Most court applications are made to the [ District Court
](/en/justice/courts-system/district-court/) . They can also be made to the [
Circuit Court ](/en/justice/courts-system/circuit-court/) as part of an
application for [ judicial separation ](/en/birth-family-
relationships/separation-and-divorce/judicial-separation/) or [ divorce
](/en/birth-family-relationships/separation-and-divorce/divorce-decrees/) .

Even if the mother does not consent to the guardianship application, it does
not automatically mean that the court will refuse the order sought by the
other parent. The court will decide what is in the best interest of the child
and the parents.
