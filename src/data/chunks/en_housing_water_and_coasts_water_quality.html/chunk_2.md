##  Introduction

Water that is provided for your consumption – drinking, preparing food, making
ice, making drinks with water and brushing teeth is known as ‘drinking water’.

You can get drinking water from two different sources. Water from lakes,
rivers and streams (surface water) will usually have to be treated to make it
safe to drink. Water from springs and boreholes (groundwater) may have to be
treated, depending on the quality of its source.

You can read information from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) [ on
