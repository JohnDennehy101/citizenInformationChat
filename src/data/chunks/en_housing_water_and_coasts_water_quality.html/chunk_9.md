###  Monitoring of drinking water supplies

How water supplies standards are monitored depends on their size and on
whether or not they supply water to the public.

**Large supplies** (supplying more than 50 people or producing more than 10
cubic metres of water a day) and **small supplies** that provide water to the
public (such as businesses, schools or social clubs) must both meet the
standards, but only the large supplies are monitored under the Regulations.

It is up to the owner of the supply to make sure that small supplies meet the
standards. At present, over 10% of consumers in Ireland get their drinking
water from such unregulated supplies, the quality of which is not officially
monitored.

The EPAâ€™s [ drinking water reports
](http://www.epa.ie/pubs/reports/water/drinking/) show that the quality of
water in regulated water supplies is high.
