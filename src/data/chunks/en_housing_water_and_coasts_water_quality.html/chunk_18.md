###  Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)

The EPA collects information from Uisce Éireann about the monitoring of
regulated water supply schemes and produces a [ yearly report on the quality
of drinking water in Ireland ](http://www.epa.ie/pubs/reports/water/drinking/)
. It has enforcement powers in relation to the drinking water quality of
public water supplies. These powers require Uisce Éireann to notify the EPA
(as well as the HSE) where there is a potential risk to human health and to
comply with their directions.
