###  Treatment of drinking water

Most water supplies need to be treated to bring them up to the standards
required â€“ read about these standards below.

Groundwater can be of high quality but this depends on the soil and rock
formation and on the agricultural practices near the source. It may only need
precautionary disinfection.

Surface waters almost always contain impurities and must be removed by a
suitable treatment process, including coagulation, filtration and
chlorination.

Under the [ Fluoridation of Water Supplies Regulations 2007 (SI 42/2007)
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2007/en/si/0042.html) fluoride is added to
the water in all public supplies.
