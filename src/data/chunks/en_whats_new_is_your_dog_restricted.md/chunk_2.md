Do you own a dog? 🐕

If your dog is a restricted breed (or a strain or cross of one), they must be:

🐾 Kept on a short strong lead (under 2 metres)

🐾 With someone over the age of 16, who is able to control them

🐾 Muzzled when in a public place

🐾 Wearing a collar with the name and address of their owner, at all times
