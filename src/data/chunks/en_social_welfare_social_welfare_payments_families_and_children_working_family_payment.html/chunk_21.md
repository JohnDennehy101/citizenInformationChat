###  **Calculating your income for WFP**

The Department of Social Protection (DSP) calculates your assessable earnings
over a certain period of time.

Because WFP is paid over 52 weeks, the DSP tries to calculate your average
earnings over a similar period of time. Normally they will use your earnings
up to the date of your application. If you are newly in employment, your
average weekly income is calculated from when you started work with that
employer.

If your spouse, civil partner or cohabitant is self-employed, their income
over the 12-month period before you apply is used to work out their average
weekly income.

Again, to qualify, your average weekly family income must be below the WFP
income limit for your family size.

**Working Family Payment income limits from 4 January 2024**

**If you have:** |  **And your weekly family income is less than:**  
---|---  
One child  |  €645   
Two children  |  €746   
Three children  |  €847   
Four children  |  €938   
Five children  |  €1,064   
Six children  |  €1,180   
Seven children  |  €1,316   
Eight or more children  |  €1,412   
  
If you qualify for WFP, you get a minimum of €20 each week. You can use the
DSP’s [ benefit of work estimator ](https://www.gov.ie/en/service/4c93cf-
benefit-of-work-estimator/) to work out the total amount you would get working
(including any Working Family Payment). It also compares this amount to what
you are getting in jobseeker payments (including Rent Supplement).

If you are getting WFP, you may also be entitled to the [ Back to School
Clothing and Footwear Allowance ](/en/social-welfare/families-and-
children/back-to-school-clothing-and-footwear-allowance/) .
