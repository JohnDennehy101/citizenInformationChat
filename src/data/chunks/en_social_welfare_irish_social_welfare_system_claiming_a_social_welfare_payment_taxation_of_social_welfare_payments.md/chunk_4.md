###  **Example: If you are working or getting an occupational pension, and
getting a social welfare pension**

You are getting a social welfare pension and an occupational pension. Your
occupational pension is taxed through the Pay-As-You-Earn ( [ PAYE
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/employment/starting-work-and-changing-
job/starting-work/tax-and-starting-work/) ) system in the same way as a wage
or salary. This means that you get your tax credits in the normal way.

To tax your social welfare pension, your annual tax credits are reduced by the
tax liability on your social welfare pension. You pay tax on both pensions,
but it is collected from the occupational pension. For higher incomes, the
standard rate cut-off point will also be reduced. The technical term for this
is ' [ coding in ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/money-and-
tax/tax/income-tax/tax-return-non-paye-income/#f7a235) _'_ of credits.

The same arrangement applies if you have income from a job and a social
welfare payment. If your social welfare payment was not 'coded in', you would
have to pay tax as a self-employed person and in a lump sum by 31 October each
year.
