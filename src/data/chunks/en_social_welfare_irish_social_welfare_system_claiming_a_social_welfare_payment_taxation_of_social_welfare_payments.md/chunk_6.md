###  **Social security pensions from abroad**

If you have a social security pension from abroad, it is also generally
taxable in Ireland. The tax is payable annually, unless you have a source of
income that is subject to PAYE.

Certain foreign pensions that would be exempt from tax if you were resident in
the country paying the pension, are also exempt from tax in Ireland.
