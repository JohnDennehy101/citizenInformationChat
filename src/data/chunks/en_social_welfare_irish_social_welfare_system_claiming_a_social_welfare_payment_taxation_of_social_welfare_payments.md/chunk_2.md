##  Is my social welfare payment taxed?

Some social welfare payments are deemed taxable, and others are not – see
tables below.

Even if your social welfare payment is taxable, you may not actually have to
pay tax on it. This is because when you get a social welfare payment, you also
get an [ Employee Tax Credit ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/money-
and-tax/tax/income-tax-credits-and-reliefs/employment-tax-credits-and-
reliefs/) (previously called a PAYE tax credit), in addition to your normal
tax credits. Tax credits reduce the amount of tax you pay. So, if a social
welfare payment is your only source of income, you may not have to pay tax
because the amount you owe in tax is less than your tax credits.

The Employee Tax Credit is given to the person claiming the social welfare
payment and not to the [ adult dependant

system/claiming-a-social-welfare-payment/claiming-an-increase-in-your-social-
welfare-payment-for-an-adult-dependant/) , even if the Increase for a
Qualified Adult is paid directly to the dependant ( [ different rules applied
before 2014 ](https://www.revenue.ie/en/tax-professionals/tdm/income-tax-
capital-gains-tax-corporation-tax/part-05/05-05-33.pdf) ).

In general, you don’t pay [ Universal Social Charge
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/money-and-tax/tax/income-
tax/universal-social-charge/) (USC) and social insurance [ (PRSI)
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-
system/social-insurance-prsi/social-insurance/) on social welfare payments.
However, PRSI is payable on income from some employment schemes, such as
Community Employment.
