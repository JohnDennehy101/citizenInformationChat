##  How do I pay tax on my social welfare payment?

If you have a social welfare payment and another source of income, you may
have to pay tax. In this case, your taxable social welfare payment and your
other income are added together, and you are taxed on the total amount.

The Department of Social Protection does not take any tax from your social
welfare payment before it is paid to you.

Social welfare payments are taxed by reducing your tax credits and rate band.
Your non-social welfare income determines how tax due is paid.
