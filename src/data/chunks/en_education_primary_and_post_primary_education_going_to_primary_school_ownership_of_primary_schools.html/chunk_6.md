The funding for new Gaelscoileanna is now on the same basis as other new
schools. The previous arrangement continues for Gaelscoileanna that have
either permanent or provisional recognition from the Department of Education.
The previous arrangement for Gaelscoileanna meant that the Department bought
the site and paid the full building cost. Where Gaelscoileanna are in rented
accommodation and the state pays the rent.

[ Gaelscoileanna Teo ](http://www.gaelscoileanna.ie/) is a voluntary body
(supported by An Foras Teanga), which is the co-ordinating body for Irish
language schools and helps parents to set up new Gaelscoileanna.
