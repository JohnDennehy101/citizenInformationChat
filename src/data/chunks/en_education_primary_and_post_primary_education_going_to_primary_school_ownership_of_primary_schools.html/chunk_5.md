###  Cost of site - new primary schools

The State pays the full cost of the site. The patron still has the choice of
funding the site cost. If the State pays, then the State owns the school
building and leases it to the patron under a lease or a deed of trust.

If the patron pays, the patron owns the school. If the State pays, it does not
change who the patron is.

The Education Act 1998 clarifies and restates the fact that the [ board of
management ](/en/education/primary-and-post-primary-education/going-to-
primary-school/boards-of-management/) does not acquire any right over or
interest in the land or buildings of the school for which it has
responsibility.
