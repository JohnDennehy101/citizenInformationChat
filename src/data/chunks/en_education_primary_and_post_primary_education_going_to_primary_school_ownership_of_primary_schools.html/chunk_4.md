##  Funding of schools

Traditionally, the site for national schools was provided locally - either
directly by the patron or as a result of local fundraising. There was also a
local contribution to the building costs and the running costs. Changes were
made over the years as multi-denominational schools and Gaelscoileanna were
being built and did not have a 'local' funding base.

Private primary schools get no State funding.
