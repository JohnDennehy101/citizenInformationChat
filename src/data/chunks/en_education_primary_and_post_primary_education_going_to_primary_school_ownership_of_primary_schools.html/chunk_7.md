##  Running costs of schools

The State pays a direct capitation grant per student to each primary school.
The State pays the teachers' salaries. Enhanced capitation grants are paid for
children with special educational needs in special schools or who attend
special classes in mainstream schools. Capitation grants are used for the day-
to-day running of schools and for teaching materials and resources.

Primary schools also receive a grant for caretaking and secretarial services
(called the Ancillary Services Grant Scheme). A local contribution was
formerly required but has now been abolished.

Each school also receives a book grant.

Each school gets a grant towards the cost of minor works.

Some schools qualify for enhanced funding under various schemes for  tackling
disadvantage in primary schools  such as DEIS and [ Early Start
