##  The school patron

The [ Education Act 1998
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1998/en/act/pub/0051/index.html) gives a
statutory basis to the role of the patron and sets out the rules for
determining who the patron is. The patron may manage the school personally or
may appoint a board of management to act as manager. Under the Act the patron
has the power to remove the board and take over managing the school or appoint
another board.

A register of patrons is kept by the Department of Education so it is possible
for anyone to check exactly who the patron of any national school is.

In general, the patron of a school is representative of the owners and can be
an individual or a group. For example:

  * If the Catholic and Church of Ireland bishops are the patrons of the schools within the diocese, with the parish priest usually carrying out the functions on behalf of the bishop. 
  * The patron of a multi-denominational school is usually the board of trustees or the limited company [ Educate Together ](http://www.educatetogether.ie/) . 
  * Gaelscoileanna may be under the patronage of the church authorities but may opt to be under the patronage of [ Foras Pátrúnachta na Scoileanna Lán-Ghaeilge, ](http://www.foras.ie/) which is a limited company set up for the purpose.
