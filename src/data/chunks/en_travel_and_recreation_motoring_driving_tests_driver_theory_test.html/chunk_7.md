##  Preparing for the test

The questions you will be asked in your driver theory test are based on the [
Rules of the Road (pdf) ](https://www.rsa.ie/docs/default-source/road-
safety/rules-of-the-road.pdf?sfvrsn=e0334acb_0) and current road traffic
legislation.

The Driver Theory Testing Service has a bank of questions. For each test, a
random selection of questions will be used from the question bank. The test is
continually updated depending on new and revised legislation.
