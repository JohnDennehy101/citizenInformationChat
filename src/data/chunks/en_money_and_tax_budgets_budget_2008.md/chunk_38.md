###  Review of VAT on Property Transactions

A review of the current system of applying VAT on property transactions has
been carried out. Provision will be made in the Finance Bill for the
introduction of a new system for applying VAT to property transactions. The
changes are designed to simplify the rules for VAT on property, while ensuring
a more equitable treatment for taxpayers. The new rules will apply to both
commercial and residential property supplied in the course of business. The
VAT charge on sales of residential property is unchanged.

The new system will take effect from 1 July 2008.
