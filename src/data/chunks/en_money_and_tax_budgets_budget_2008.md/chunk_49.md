###  Claw-back of relief for first-time purchasers and other owner-occupiers  

An exemption from stamp duty is generally available for first-time owner-
occupying purchasers of new or second-hand dwelling houses or apartments.
There is also an exemption available for other owner-occupying purchasers of
new dwelling houses or apartments under 125 square metres. In addition,
partial relief is also available to owner-occupying purchasers of new dwelling
houses or apartments over 125 square metres. These exemptions/reliefs are
clawed-back where the purchaser rents out the dwelling house or apartment,
other than under rent-a-room arrangements, within 5 years of the date of the
deed of transfer giving effect to the purchase.  
  
This claw-back period is being reduced for all three reliefs from 5 to 2 years
for deeds of transfer executed on, or after, 5 December 2007. For deeds of
transfer executed before 5 December 2007, to the extent that a dwelling house
or apartment is rented out on or after 5 December 2007, it will not involve a
claw-back of relief where this happens in the third, fourth or fifth year of
ownership.
