###  Mortgage interest relief

The current annual ceiling on the amount of interest that can be allowed on a
mortgage is being increased with effect from 1 January 2008 for first-time
buyers from €8,000 to €10,000 for a single person and from €16,000 to €20,000
for married people. The additional relief will be available for the first
seven years for which there is an entitlement to mortgage interest relief.
