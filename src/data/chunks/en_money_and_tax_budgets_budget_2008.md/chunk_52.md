###  Increase in site to child exemption

The existing Site to Child relief from stamp duty and Capital Gains Tax
provides an exemption under both taxes on sites with a market value not
exceeding €254,000, where a parent transfers the site to a child for the
purposes of constructing the child's principal private residence. The
exemption threshold of €254,000 is being increased to €500,000. This change
will take effect in respect of disposals made on or after Budget day (5
December 2007).

Since 2007 the area of the site must be less than 1 acre (0.4047 hectare)
exclusive of the area occupied by the house itself.
