###  Vehicle Registration Tax  

The current VRT system uses engine size as the criterion to determine the VRT
rate to be applied to a car. Under the revised VRT system the CO2 emissions of
a car will replace engine size as the criterion to determine the VRT rate
payable on the car at point of registration. Lower emission cars will attract
reduced VRT rates and higher emission cars will be liable to higher rates. The
VRT rates will continue to be applied to the Open Market Selling Price of the
car. The revised VRT system will take effect on 1 July 2008.

The following Table sets out the CO2 Emission Bands and the relevant VRT rates
under the revised VRT system.
