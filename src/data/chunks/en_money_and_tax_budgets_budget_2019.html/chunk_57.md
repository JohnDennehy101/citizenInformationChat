###  Gas-propelled vehicles and refuelling equipment

Measures will be introduced to encourage the uptake of gas-propelled
commercial vehicles as an economic and environmentally friendly alternative to
diesel. This includes a new accelerated capital allowances scheme for gas-
propelled commercial vehicles and refuelling equipment.

As set out in the National Development Plan, Ireland will no longer purchase
diesel-only buses for the urban public service obligation (PSO) bus fleets
after July 2019.
