###  Supports for homeless people

The current allocation for **homeless services** will increase by €30 million,
to €146 million in 2019. This will be used to fund emergency accommodation and
help people transition from homelessness into long-term housing.

It is intended that 5,000 adults will exit homelessness in 2019.

The **Housing First initiative** and the **Family Hub programme** will
continue to be funded and rolled out in 2019.

An extra €60 million will be made available to fund additional **emergency
accommodation** and family hubs for winter 2018.
