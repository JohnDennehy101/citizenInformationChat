##  Legal status of pre-nuptial agreements

Pre-nuptial agreements have no basis in law in Ireland. As a result, they are
not strictly binding. This means that if you have a pre-nuptial agreement in
place and you end up in court following the breakdown of your marriage, the
judge is not bound by the terms of the pre-nuptial agreement.

The only provision in Irish law is under sections 113 and 113A of the [
Succession Act 1965
](http://revisedacts.lawreform.ie/eli/1965/act/27/revised/en/pdf?annotations=true)
(as amended) where a spouse or a civil partner can renounce his/her legal
right share in a pre-nuptial agreement.

Although they are not legally binding, there is nothing in Irish law which
stops a couple planning to marry from having and signing a pre-nuptial
agreement. Importantly, such agreements can serve as guides for the courts in
[ judicial separation ](/en/birth-family-relationships/separation-and-
divorce/judicial-separation/) and [ divorce ](/en/birth-family-
relationships/separation-and-divorce/divorce-decrees/) cases. If a pre-nuptial
agreement makes ‘proper provision’ for each person it is more likely to be
persuasive on the judge. Therefore, in situations where one party is likely to
inherit a significant family farm or business, it will guide the judge in the
divorce or judicial separation on what the parties’ intentions were at the
outset.
