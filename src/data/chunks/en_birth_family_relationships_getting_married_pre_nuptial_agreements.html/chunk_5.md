##  The future of pre-nuptial agreements

In April 2007, the Government published the [ Report of the Study Group on
Pre-nuptial Agreements (pdf)
](http://www.justice.ie/en/JELR/PrenupRpt.pdf/Files/PrenupRpt.pdf) . The
report recommended that pre-nuptial agreements be legislated for by way of
introducing a new Section 16(2)A of the [ Family Law Act 1995
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1995/en/act/pub/0026/index.html) and new
Section 20(3)A of the [ Family Law (Divorce) Act 1996
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1996/en/act/pub/0033/index.html) so that the
courts would be required to have regard to existing pre-nuptial agreements
when making ancillary relief orders in judicial separation and divorce
proceedings.

The report also recommended that the legislation should contain procedural
guidelines, that is, how a pre-nuptial agreement is drawn up, what is required
for it to be enforceable. It is recommended that it must be:

  * In writing, signed and witnessed 
  * Made after each party has received separate legal advice 
  * Made with full disclosure of financial information 
  * Made not less than 28 days before the marriage 

The report also recommended that pre-nuptial agreements be reviewable on
death. This is so that a court may make financial provision for a surviving
spouse who may be unfairly affected by the provisions of a pre-nuptial
agreement on the death of the other spouse in certain circumstances.

The reportâ€™s recommendations have not yet been implemented.
