##  Drafting a pre-nuptial agreement

Only pre-nuptial agreements entered into following independent legal advice
for both parties are likely to be taken into account. The court would have to
be satisfied that there had been a complete disclosure of assets before the
agreement was signed. It is also advisable for the agreement to provide for
reviews:

  * Periodically (for example, every five years) 
  * If children are born 
  * If there is a major change in circumstances (for example, assets are purchased or sold) 

The agreement should be in writing, be signed by each party and comply with
the rules of contract law.
