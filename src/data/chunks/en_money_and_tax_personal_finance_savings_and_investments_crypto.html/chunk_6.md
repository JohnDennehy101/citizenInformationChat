###  Authorisation of crypto service providers

Under MiCAR, Crypto-Asset Service Providers in the EU will have to be
authorised by a central bank. The law comes into effect on 30 December 2024
but there will be a transitional (lead-in) period of 12 months before it
applies to existing providers in Ireland.
