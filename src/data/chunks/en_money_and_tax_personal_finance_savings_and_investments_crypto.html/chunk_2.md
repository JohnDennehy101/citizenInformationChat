##  What is crypto?

The term crypto is most often used to refer to cryptocurrencies.

Standard currencies are types of money, for example, the euro, that you can
spend using physical notes and coins.

Cryptocurrency exists digitally or virtually and is transferred digitally.
Transactions are recorded and verified using a technology called blockchain.
This is known as _distributed ledger technology_ which means that it is a
record that is widely shared and is not controlled by any single person or
organisation.

Examples of cryptocurrencies include Bitcoin and Ethereum but there are many
others.
