##  Risks of crypto

The [ Central Bank of Ireland describes crypto
](https://www.centralbank.ie/consumer-hub/crypto-consumer-information) as
being more like a very high-risk speculative asset than a currency. This is
because crypto has had very big increases and decreases in value that happen
very quickly and it can be used to make purchases only in limited
circumstances.

For this reason, it recommends that you do not spend money on crypto if you
cannot afford to lose it.

There are no protections such as the [ deposit guarantee scheme.
](https://www.depositguarantee.ie/) This means you have no comeback if you
lose some or all of your money on crypto.

Crypto can be very complex, making it difficult to understand what you are
buying.

common crypto scams ](https://www.ccpc.ie/consumers/money/digital-crypto-
