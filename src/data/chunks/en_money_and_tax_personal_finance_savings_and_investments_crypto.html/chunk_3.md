##  Is crypto legal in Ireland?

Crypto is not banned in Ireland so it is legal. There are not very many laws
about crypto, so it is said to be largely unregulated.

Some  new laws are being introduced by the European Union  . These will
require the providers of crypto services to be authorised to operate in the
EU.
