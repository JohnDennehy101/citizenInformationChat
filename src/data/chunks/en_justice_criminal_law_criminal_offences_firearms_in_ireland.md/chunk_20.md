###  **Restricted or non-restricted firearms**

There are 2 different categories of firearms in Ireland â€“ _restricted_ and
_non-restricted_ .

A non-restricted firearm is a small calibre firearm that can hold no more than
5 rounds.

Additional restrictions are placed on owning and using restricted firearms
because they are considered particularly dangerous.

You can check if your firearm is restricted or listed as non-restricted under
