##  Introduction

If you own or want to own a firearm in Ireland, you must have a firearm
certificate.

The most common type of firearm is a gun. However, the following are
considered firearms under Irish law and also need a licence:

  * Crossbows 
  * Spearguns 
  * All airguns with a muzzle velocity (speed) of over 1 joule (including paintball markers) 

An [ Garda Síochána ](http://www.garda.ie/) grant firearm certificates and
they are responsible for supervising firearm use. If you want to make a
complaint or raise a concern about the use of firearms, you should contact the
Gardaí. In an emergency always call 999 or 112.

The law relating to firearms is mainly contained in the [ Firearms Act 1925
](https://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1925/act/17/enacted/en/html) .
