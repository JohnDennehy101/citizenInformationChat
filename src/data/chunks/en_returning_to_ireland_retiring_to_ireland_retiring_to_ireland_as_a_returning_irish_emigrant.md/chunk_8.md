####  EEA and Swiss nationals

[ European Economic Area (EEA) and Swiss nationals ](/en/moving-
country/moving-to-ireland/rights-of-residence-in-ireland/residence-rights-eu-
national/) can live in Ireland for up to 3 months without restriction. But if
they plan to stay more than 3 months, they must either be working or have
sickness insurance and enough money to support themselves, so they do not
become a burden on the state.
