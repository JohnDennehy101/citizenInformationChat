##  Introduction

In certain circumstances you can use a special right that means you can refuse
to hand over documents to the court or answer certain questions even if those
documents or questions are relevant to the case. This is called the _doctrine
of privilege_ .

There are two main types of privilege:

  * Private privilege 
  * Public interest privilege
