###  **Adult Caution Referral form**

When a garda believes you may be suitable for a caution, the garda fills out
an Adult Caution Referral Form.

As the offender, you are then told by the member in charge of the garda
station in plain language about the Adult Cautioning Scheme.

If you understand the adult cautioning procedure and you agree to be
considered for the Scheme, you are asked by the garda to sign Part E of the
Referral Form. This signature is witnessed by the Gardaí.

The member in charge of the Garda Station sends the Referral Form to the
Superintendent with their views and recommendations. The Superintendent then
can decide to:

  * Administer a caution 
  * Refuse a caution 

Or

  * Refer the matter to the Director of Public Prosecutions for direction 

You will be told that you can seek legal advice before agreeing or refusing a
caution under the Scheme. If the offender wants to get legal advice, they must
do so promptly.

**Giving the caution**

A Garda Superintendent or a Garda Inspector, who is acting as the
Superintendent, gives the caution.

You will be cautioned in a Garda station. You must agree in writing that:

  * You accept the caution, and 
  * You accept that the caution will be recorded and will be made known to a court if you have any subsequent conviction for any criminal offence. 

**When does the** **adult caution happen and how long does it last?**

The member in charge of the garda station arranges a suitable time and place
for the Superintendent to give the caution. When the caution is given, a copy
of the completed Adult Caution Referral Form is given to you, the offender.

The entire procedure from detecting the crime to giving the caution is carried
out as soon as possible, within days rather than months.

**Can I get a second caution?**

The idea of the caution is that it should only be applied **once** to an
offender, but it may (only in the most exceptional circumstances) be given to
someone who has previously been cautioned.

Examples of exceptional circumstances include:

  * Where the subsequent offence is a very minor one 
  * Where there has been a long gap in time since the first caution and the Superintendent believes that a second caution after such a time lapse would benefit the person 

If a Superintendent decides to give a second or subsequent caution to any
person, then the Gardaí must first get the permission of the [ Director of
Public Prosecutions ](/en/justice/law-enforcement/director-of-public-
prosecutions/) .
