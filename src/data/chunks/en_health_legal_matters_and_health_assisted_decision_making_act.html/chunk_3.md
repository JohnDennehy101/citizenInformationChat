##  What is capacity?

Capacity is your ability to understand when a decision is being made and the
nature and consequences of the decision in the context of the available
choices. You are always presumed to have capacity.

The new legislation sets out a _functional test_ for the assessment of
capacity. This means that your ability to make a decision is assessed based on
the decision that has to be made at that time. You do not lose your capacity
to make decisions in general.

The test for capacity recognises that your capacity can change over time,
meaning you might need more or less support in the future.

You lack the capacity to make a specific decision if you are unable to:

  * Understand the information relevant to the decision 
  * Retain that information long enough to make a voluntary choice 
  * Use or weigh that information as part of the process of making the decision, or 
  * Communicate your decision 

You do not lack capacity simply because you:

  * Need information to be explained to you in an appropriate way considering your circumstances 
  * Can only retain the relevant information for a short period of time 
  * Lacked capacity for a particular decision at one time but you may no longer lack capacity to make that decision, or 
  * Lack capacity for some decisions but you have capacity to make decisions on other matters
