##  Changes to current decision-making arrangements

Since 26 April 2023, applications for adults to become a [ ward of court
](http://staging.citizensinformation.ie/en/health/legal-matters-and-
health/advance-care-directives/) can no longer be made.

If you are currently an adult ward of court, or you are a ward who will turn
18 before 26 October 2025, your wardship will be reviewed by the courts and
you will be discharged from wardship within 3 years. The courts will decide
what decision support arrangement, if any, you need. An application can also
be made to court for this review to happen before then.

If you are a ward of court under 18 who is still under 18 on 26 October 2025,
your wardship will be reviewed within 6 months of turning 18.

[ Advance healthcare directives ](/en/health/legal-matters-and-health/advance-
care-directives/) and [ enduring powers of attorney ](/en/death/before-a-
death/power-of-attorney/) are already recognised in Ireland but the 2015 Act
establishes a legal framework for them.
