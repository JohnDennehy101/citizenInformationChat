##  What a part-time worker is

You are a part-time worker if you work less hours than a _comparable_ full-
time worker doing the same type of work.

A comparable full-time worker works for the same employer as you, **and
either** :

  * Does the same job in the same or similar conditions 
  * Is capable of substituting or temporarily replacing you in performing the work 
  * Does the same or similar work with only minor variations in responsibilities and working conditions 
  * Does work of equal or lower value than yours 

For example, a part-time sales assistant can compare themselves to a full-time
sales assistant who is doing the same job, in the same shop.
