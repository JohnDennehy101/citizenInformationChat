###  **USC**

The [ Universal Social Charge (USC)
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/money-and-tax/tax/income-
tax/universal-social-charge/) is tax you pay on _gross income_ (this is your
total pay before any money is deducted, including your basic salary and any
overtime, commission or bonus).

If you earn more than €13,000 a year, you pay USC on your full income.

You do not pay any USC if your total income is €13,000 or less a year.
