###  **Casual workers**

A casual worker is a part-time worker who works on a casual basis. Casual
workers are normally on standby to do work as required without fixed hours or
attendance arrangements.

You are a casual worker if you have less than 13 continuous weeksâ€™ service,
are not in regular or seasonal employment, or are casual based on a collective
agreement.
