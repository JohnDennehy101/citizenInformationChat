##  Making a complaint

If you have a complaint, you should speak to your employer directly. If you
cannot resolve your complaint informally, you can bring your complaint to the
Workplace Relations Commission (WRC) using the [ online complaint form
](https://www.workplacerelations.ie/en/e-complaint_form/) .

You must make the complaint **within 6 months** of the dispute taking place.
The time limit may be extended for a further 6 months, if there is a
_reasonable cause_ which prevented you from bringing the complaint within the
normal time limit.
