###  **Example**

Your full-time co-workers must work 39 hours a week before they get overtime
pay. Your employer can decide that part-time employees must also work 39 hours
before getting overtime pay.

If you typically work 20 hours a week, you will be paid at your normal rate
for hours worked between 20 and 39 hours. Any hours you work beyond 39 hours
will be paid at an overtime rate.

By law, employers don’t have to pay higher rates like ‘double time’ for
overtime. However, they must pay at least the normal hourly rate for overtime
hours worked.
