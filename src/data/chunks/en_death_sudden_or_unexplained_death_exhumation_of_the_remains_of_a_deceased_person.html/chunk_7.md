##  Role of the Environmental Health Officer

When the local authority receives your request for an exhumation, the
Environmental Health Officer (EHO) inspects the grave of the deceased person
and may ask the cemetery managers and the undertakers for further information
as required.

  * The EHO attends and supervises the exhumation to ensure that respect for the deceased person is maintained and that public health is protected 
  * If the remains are to be reburied in the same local authority area, the EHO also supervises the reburial 
  * If the remains are to be reburied elsewhere, the EHO will ensure that the appropriate local authority receives all the details it needs
