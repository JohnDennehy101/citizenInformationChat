###  Examples of situations where exhumation may occur include:

  * For family reasons (for example if the family of the deceased person want the remains to be moved to another burial ground) 
  * For public health reasons (for example if a cemetery is being moved) 
  * When the Minister for Justice orders an exhumation as part of a criminal investigation 

The information on this page is about families arranging an exhumation for the
purpose of reburial elsewhere.
