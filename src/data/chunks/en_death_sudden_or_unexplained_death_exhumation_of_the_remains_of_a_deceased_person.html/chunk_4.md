##  Getting an exhumation license

Exhumation licences are issued by your local authority. You should ask your
local authority for an application form and return the completed form with the
following:

  * The fee (this varies from one local authority to another) 
  * A copy of the [ death certificate ](/en/death/practical-arrangements-after-a-death/registering-a-death/) of the deceased person 

The local authority may ask for further documentation if needed.
