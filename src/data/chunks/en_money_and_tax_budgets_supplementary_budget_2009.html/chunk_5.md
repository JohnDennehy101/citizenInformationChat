###  Supplementary Welfare Allowance

The personal rate of Supplementary Welfare Allowance (SWA) will be reduced to
€100 per week for new claimants under 20 years of age (first week of May
2009).

The maximum Increase for a Qualified Adult payable to a Supplementary Welfare
Allowance claimant aged under 20 will also be reduced to €100 per week (first
week of May 2009).

However, these reduced personal and qualified adult rates of payment will not
apply where a claimant is entitled to an Increase for a Qualified Child.
