###  Further and higher education

These measures will provide 6,910 additional places for unemployed people in
the further and higher education sectors. The cost of these initiatives (and
the training costs of the redundant apprentice programme being implemented in
conjunction with D/ETE) will amount to â‚¬18.85 million in 2009 and will be
funded through reallocation of resources within the D/ES budget.
