##  What is a service statement?

You will get a Service Statement if your child is deemed to have a disability.
A Service Statement lists the services the HSE proposes to provide to meet
your childâ€™s needs.

It is prepared by a Liaison Officer and must be completed within one month of
the assessment report being completed.

When preparing the Service Statement, the Liaison Officer considers both:

  * The costs and availability of services 
  * The timescale for delivery of services 

By law, the HSE must provide the services named in the Service Statement. The
Service Statement must be clear and easily understood.
