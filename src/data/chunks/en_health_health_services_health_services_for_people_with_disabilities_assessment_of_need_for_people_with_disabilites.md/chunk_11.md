###  Who is entitled to services?

By law, the child or young person must have a ‘substantial restriction’ to be
entitled to services following an Assessment of Need.

A substantial restriction means that the child or young person has a
significant difficulty with communication, learning or mobility or
significantly disordered cognitive processes.

The child or young person must also:

  * Have a restriction that is permanent (or likely to be permanent) 
  * Need services to be provided continually 

If the applicant is a child, there must be a need for services early in life
to help their disability.
