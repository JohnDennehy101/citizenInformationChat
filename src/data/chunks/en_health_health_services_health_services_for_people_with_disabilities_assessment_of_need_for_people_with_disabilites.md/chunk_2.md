##  Introduction

An Assessment of Need is an assessment carried out by the HSE for children or
young people with a disability. The assessment identifies your child's health
needs and what health services are needed to meet your child’s needs.

You don’t have to get an Assessment of Need to access HSE services. You can
apply directly to services outside of the Assessment of Need process.

The Assessment of Need is set out in the [ Disability Act 2005
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2005/act/14/enacted/en/html) .

This page will explain who can apply for an assessment, how to apply for an
assessment, what happens after the assessment is complete and how to complain
or appeal if you are unhappy with your assessment report, Service Statement or
provision of services.
