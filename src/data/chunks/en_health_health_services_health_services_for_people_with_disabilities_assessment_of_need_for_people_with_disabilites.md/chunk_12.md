###  Who arranges delivery of health services?

After the Service Statement is complete, the Liaison Officer arranges the
delivery of services with the different service providers.

If needs other than health (for example, housing or transport) are identified,
the Assessment Officer can refer the matter to the relevant public body such
as the local housing authority or public transport service.
