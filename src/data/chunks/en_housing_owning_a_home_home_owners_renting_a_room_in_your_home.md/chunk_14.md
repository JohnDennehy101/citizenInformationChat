###  Your social welfare payments

If you are getting a means-tested [ weekly social assistance payment
](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/social-assistance-
payments/social-assistance-in-ireland/) , [ Supplementary Welfare Allowance
](/en/social-welfare/supplementary-welfare-schemes/supplementary-welfare-
allow/) or [ Working Family Payment ](/en/social-welfare/families-and-
children/working-family-payment/) , you can get up to €269.23 a week (€14,000
per year) for renting out a room in your own home without it affecting your
social welfare payment.

This also applies if you are getting the [ Living Alone Increase ](/en/social-
welfare/extra-social-welfare-benefits/living-alone-allowance/) , [ Household
Benefits Package ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-
welfare/social-welfare-payments/extra-social-welfare-benefits/household-
benefits-package/) or [ Fuel Allowance
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/social-welfare-
payments/extra-social-welfare-benefits/fuel-allowance/) . However, with Fuel
Allowance, the person renting the room from you must be getting a qualifying
social welfare payment or must qualify for Fuel Allowance in their own right.
You should check if renting a room in your home will affect any other
payments.
