##  Do I qualify for the rent-a-room relief scheme?

To qualify for rent-a room tax relief:

  * Your home must be located in Ireland. 
  * You must occupy your home as your sole residence. This means that it is your home for the greater part of the year and it is where people would normally expect to contact you. 
  * Your total rental income cannot be more than â‚¬14,000 per tax year (1 January to 31 December). This includes any money that your tenant pays for food, utilities, laundry or similar goods and services. 
  * The people you rent to must use the room on a long-term basis. This means stays of more than 28 days in a row.
