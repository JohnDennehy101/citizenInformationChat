###  **What is not covered by the rent-a-room relief scheme?**

You will not qualify for the relief if:

  * Your gross income from rent and related services is over â‚¬14,000. In this case, Revenue will treat the full rental income minus allowable expenses as part of your total income for tax purposes and this should be included in your tax return. 
  * You are renting the room in your home to your spouse, civil partner or partner, son or daughter. There is no restriction for other family members. 
  * You are an employee or office-holder in a company, and the company pays you to allow clients to use the room in your home on an occasional basis. 
  * You are renting the room to short-term guests for a period that does not exceed 28 consecutive days, for example, through an online accommodation booking site.
