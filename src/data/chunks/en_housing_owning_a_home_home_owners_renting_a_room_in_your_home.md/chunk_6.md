####  Short-term lets

The relief does not apply to short-term lets. Short-term lets are lettings
that do not exceed 28 consecutive days. The occupants must be using the room
on a long-term basis.

For example, renting a room to a student for the academic year or for a one-
month course is covered, but providing accommodation to occasional visitors
for short periods, such as through an online accommodation booking site, is
not, as this income is not considered to be rental income. This is because the
visitors use the accommodation as guests.

If you normally rent out the room for the academic year and you rent it out
for short breaks during the summer as well, you must identify the income you
get from the short rentals separately from the income that qualifies for rent-
a-room relief, when making your tax return to Revenue.
