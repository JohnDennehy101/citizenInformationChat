####  How to opt-out of rent-a-room relief

If you want to opt out of the rent-a-room relief in a particular tax year and
be taxed on the rental income instead, you must notify Revenue. You can notify
them:

  * Using MyEnquiries in [ MyAccount ](https://www.ros.ie/myaccount-web/sign_in.html?execution=e1s1)
  * By writing to [ your local tax office ](https://www.revenue.ie/en/contact-us/index.aspx)

You must contact Revenue on or before the return filing date for that tax
year. Read more on [ revenue.ie ](https://www.revenue.ie/en/personal-tax-
