##  What is rent-a-room tax relief?

Rent-a-room relief lets you earn up to â‚¬14,000 per year tax-free if you rent
out a room in your home to private tenants. You can also get the relief if you
rent out a self-contained unit, such as a basement flat or a converted garage.

You claim the rent-a-room tax relief when you make your annual tax return, see
' [ How to apply ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/housing/owning-a-
home/home-owners/renting-a-room-in-your-home/#10ea51) ' below.

If you rent out a room in your home, you have certain rights and
responsibilities. Our page on ' [ Renting out a room in your home
](/en/housing/owning-a-home/home-owners/renting-out-a-room-in-your-home/) '
has more information about this.
