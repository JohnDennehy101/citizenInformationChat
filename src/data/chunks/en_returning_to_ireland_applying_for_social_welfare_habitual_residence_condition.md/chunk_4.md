##  I’m an Irish citizen – does the HRC apply to me?

Yes, the HRC applies to anyone applying for any of the social welfare payments
listed above. Irish citizens are not exempt from the habitual residence
condition.

If you have returned permanently to Ireland, you can be regarded as being
habitually resident on your return if you can:

  * Show that your main centre of interest is now in Ireland 
  * Prove you are resuming your previous residence here (see ‘How do I satisfy the HRC?’ below) 

You do not have to be living in Ireland for a certain period of time to be
considered habitually resident. In other words, if you are an Irish citizen
and meet all the conditions set out below, you can be habitually resident from
the date you return.

If you have children or qualified adult dependants, they do not have to
satisfy the HRC unless they are applying for their own payment.
