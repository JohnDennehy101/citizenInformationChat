###  **The Department makes a decision**

The Department will review your application by considering the 5 factors
listed above. When considering these factors, they will examine:

  * Your level of contact with friends or family in Ireland while you were abroad 
  * If your family members have returned to Ireland with you, or if they remain overseas 
  * The reason for your return 
  * What arrangements you have made to stay in Ireland long-term (for example, where you will live and work) 
  * Whether you have moved your belongings back to Ireland 
  * If you have imported your car and registered it here 
  * If you have joined any local clubs or organisations
