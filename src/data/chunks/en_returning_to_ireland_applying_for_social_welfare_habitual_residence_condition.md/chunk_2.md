##  What is the habitual residence condition (HRC)?

If you want to apply for certain social welfare payments (such as Child
Benefit), you must show that you’re ‘habitually resident’ in Ireland.

The term ‘habitually resident _’_ is not defined in Irish law. In practice, it
means that you can prove a close link to Ireland, you have lived here and plan
to continue living here for the foreseeable future.

When deciding if you are habitually resident, the Department will consider the
following 5 factors:

  1. How long you have lived in Ireland or any other country 
  2. The reason you lived abroad 
  3. The nature and pattern of your employment 
  4. Your main place of interest 
  5. Your plans to live in Ireland for the foreseeable future, according to the evidence provided 

When you are habitually resident, you are said to ‘satisfy the habitual
residence condition’ (HRC).

See ‘How do I satisfy the HRC?’ below.
