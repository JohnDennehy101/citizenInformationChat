###  Use of a headlight

You should dip the headlight on your motorcycle in the following situations:

  * Meeting oncoming vehicles (for example, vehicles coming towards you from the opposite direction) 
  * In built-up areas where public lighting is provided and special speed limit areas 
  * In times of poor visibility (for example, heavy fog, snow, rain, or dust) 
  * Travelling behind another vehicle 
  * When not using your head-light would cause an inconvenience to other road users
