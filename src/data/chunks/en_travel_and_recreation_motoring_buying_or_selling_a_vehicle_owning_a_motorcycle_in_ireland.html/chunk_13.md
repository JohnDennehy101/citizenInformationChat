###  Lighting-up hours

All motorcyclists must use lights (other than stop lights) during lighting-up
hours. Lighting-up hours start half an hour after sunset and end half an hour
before sunrise. If you are using your motorcycle during the day when
visibility is poor, you must use your lights.

These rules are set down in the [ Road Traffic (Lighting of Vehicles)
Regulations, 1963 (as amended)
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1963/en/si/0189.html) . The Regulations aim
to prevent accidents and protect the lives of road users. The Garda Síochána
are responsible for enforcing the law on motorcycle lights.
