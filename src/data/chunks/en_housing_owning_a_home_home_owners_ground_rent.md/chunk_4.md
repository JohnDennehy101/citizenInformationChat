##  Can I buy out my ground rent?

If you are buying a property, you may be able to buy out the ground rent once
you’ve bought the property. This will make you the outright owner of your
property. You can buy the ground rent privately or using the [ Ground Rents
Purchase Scheme ](https://www.tailte.ie/en/registration/ground-rents/ground-
rents-purchase-scheme/) .

The amount you pay to buy out the ground rent can be:

  * Agreed with your ground landlord (consent procedure) 
  * Reached through an arbitration procedure 

If you are buying your ground rent out under the Ground Rents Purchase Scheme,
you must use the arbitration procedure to set the amount you pay. You cannot
agree the amount with the ground landlord. Tailte Éireann will do all the
legal work for a fee.

If you buy out your ground rent, Tailte Éireann will issue a Vesting
Certificate. The Vesting Certificate is a new [ title deed to your property
](/en/housing/owning-a-home/buying-a-home/property-deeds/) . You should
register this with the Land Registry, to record that your ownership of the
property has changed from leasehold to freehold.

In some circumstances it is not possible to buy out your ground rent. For
example, if it is not in the public interest, or if there is a specific clause
in a lease that prevents it. However, this is rare.

The Tailte Éireann website has an [ FAQ
](https://www.tailte.ie/en/registration/ground-rents/faq/) and more [ detailed
information ](https://www.tailte.ie/en/registration/ground-rents/) about
buying out your ground rent.
