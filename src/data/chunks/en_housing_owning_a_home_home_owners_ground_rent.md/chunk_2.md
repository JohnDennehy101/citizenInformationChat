##  What is ground rent?

There are 2 types of property ownership in Ireland:

  * Leasehold 
  * Freehold 

If you own the **leasehold interest** in a property, it means that you own the
building and not the land it is on. It also means that your ownership is for a
fixed number of years.

If you own a leasehold property, you must pay a ground rent to your _ground
landlord._ This is the person who owns the ground your property is built on.
Often the ground landlord is your local authority.

If you own the **freehold interest** in a property, it means that you own the
land and buildings. Your ownership is not limited to a fixed number of years
and you do not have to pay ground rent.
