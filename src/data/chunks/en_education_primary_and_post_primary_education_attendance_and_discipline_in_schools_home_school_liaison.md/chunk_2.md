##  What is the Home School Community Liaison Scheme?

The [ Home School Community Liaison Scheme
](https://www.gov.ie/en/service/6c72da-home-school-community-liaison-scheme-
hscl/) (HSCL) supports students with poor attendance at school and who are at
risk of leaving school early.

The Scheme is funded through the Department of Education and is managed by [
Tusla’s Educational Support Service (TESS) ](https://www.tusla.ie/tess/) .

The HSCL Scheme aims to:

  * Support parents to be a resource to their own children and become involved in their child’s education 
  * Promote co-operation between home, school and relevant community agencies in the educational interests of the child 
  * Work with parents to prepare and support them as a resource to their own children and encourage parents to become involved in their child’s education 
  * Help the child’s learning and improve their chances of staying in school 

The HSCL co-ordinator is a designated teacher in the school. The HSCL co-
ordinator can:

  * Make home visits 
  * Organise parent classes and other courses 
  * Support families as their child moves through the education system 

The coordinator works closely with the [ School Completion Programme and the
Educational Welfare Service ](/en/education/the-irish-education-
