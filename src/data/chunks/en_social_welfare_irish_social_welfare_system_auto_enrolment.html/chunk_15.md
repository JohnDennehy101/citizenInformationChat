###  **What is the maximum contribution?**

For every €3 that you contribute to your pension fund, your employer will put
in €3, and the Government will put in €1. This means that for every €3 you
contribute, €7 will be added to your account.

Both an employer’s and the Government’s contributions are capped at €80,000
gross annual salary.

This means for the first 3 years, the maximum amount an employer can
contribute is €1,200 a year. This is because 1.5% of €80,000 is €1,200. The
maximum amount the Government can contribute is €400 a year, which is 0.5% of
€80,000.

If you earn over €80,000, you can still contribute but your employer or the
Government won't match your contributions on any income over €80,000.
