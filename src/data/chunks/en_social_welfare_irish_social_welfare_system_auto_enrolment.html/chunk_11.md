###  What happens to my savings if I opt-out?

Contributions that are not refunded, including those made by your employer and
the Government, stay in your savings pot and will continue to be invested.

If you stop working or move abroad at any time before retirement, you will
stay enrolled, but you will not make additional contributions. Your existing
savings will continue to be invested.

This means you can still access a pension pot at retirement.
