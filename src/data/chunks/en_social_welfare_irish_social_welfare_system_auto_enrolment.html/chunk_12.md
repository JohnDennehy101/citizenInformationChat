###  Automatically re-enrolled after 2 years

If you leave the plan or suspend your contributions, you will be automatically
re-enrolled after 2 years if you are still eligible for the scheme. However,
if you have an alternative pension plan, you wonâ€™t be re-enrolled.

You can rejoin the plan at any time before the 2 years pass.
