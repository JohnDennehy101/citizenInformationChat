##  How much do I pay?

The amount you pay will be a set rate of your annual salary. Your employer
will match your contributions, and the Government will contribute an
additional amount. You cannot pay more or less than the set rate.

You and your employer will pay 1.5% of your annual salary in the first year.
This will increase to 6% by year 10.
