##  Who will be automatically enrolled?

You will be automatically enrolled in the new pension scheme if you are an
employee and:

  * You are age between 23 and 60 
  * You are not currently part of a pension plan 
  * You earn €20,000 or more per year 

If you previously contributed to a pension but don’t anymore, and you meet the
other conditions, you will be automatically enrolled.

If you earn less than €20,000 per year, or you are not age between 23 and 60,
you can choose to join the pension scheme if you are not already part of a
pension plan.
