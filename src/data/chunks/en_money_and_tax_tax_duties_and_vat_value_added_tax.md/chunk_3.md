##  How VAT is charged

VAT is a tax on consumer spending, so everyone who pays for goods and services
pays VAT. It is built into the cost of many commonly consumed items such as
clothing and petrol, so you don’t see what percentage of VAT you are paying.
However, when you are buying some items or services, such as electricity and
professional services, you may see the amount of VAT and the rate at which you
are being charged on your bill.

VAT is charged at every stage of sale where the cost of an item is increased.

The [ current standard rate ](https://www.revenue.ie/en/vat/vat-rates/search-
vat-rates/current-vat-rates.aspx) of VAT is 23%.

**Example**

A manufacturer sells a television to a wholesaler for €100 and charges him VAT
on that amount at 23%. Therefore, the wholesaler pays €123 for the television.
The manufacturer then pays the VAT of €23 to the government.

The wholesaler goes on to sell the television to a retailer for €200. He adds
on VAT at 23%, so the retailer pays a total of €246. The wholesaler must pay
the government the VAT of €46, but he can reclaim the €23 VAT he has already
paid to the manufacturer, leaving €23, which he pays to the government.

When the retailer comes to sell the television to a consumer, he must also add
on VAT to his selling price. He sells the television for €300, plus VAT at
23%, making a selling price of €369 for the consumer. The retailer must pay
the VAT to the government but he can claim back the €46 VAT that he paid to
the wholesaler, leaving €23 for the government.

The government has now received 23% on the price paid for the television by
the consumer (€69). The retailer, wholesaler and manufacturer only paid the
amount of VAT they charged to the next group down the line.
