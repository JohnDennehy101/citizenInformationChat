###  If you go back to education:

Generally, people in full-time education are not eligible for Rent Supplement.
Your spouse, civil partner or cohabitant can be in full-time education while
you are getting Rent Supplement.

If you are getting a [ Back to Education Allowance ](/en/social-welfare/back-
to-education/back-to-education-allowance/) or taking part in a [ Springboard
course ](/en/education/third-level-education/applying-to-college/springboard/)
, you can keep your Rent Supplement.

If you are on an approved training course [ (FET (previously F√ÅS) course
](/en/education/further-education-and-training/training-courses/) ) you can
keep or apply for Rent Supplement. If you are participating in an approved
training course, any lunch or travel allowances paid may be disregarded.

You can apply for or keep Rent Supplement while on a [ Vocational Training
Opportunities Scheme (VTOS) ](/en/education/further-education-and-
training/vocational-training-opportunities-scheme/) or [ Youthreach
](/en/education/further-education-and-training/youthreach/) .

Some people can return to education and keep their [ Disability Allowance
](/en/social-welfare/disability-and-illness/disability-allowance/) or [ One-
Parent Family Payment ](/en/social-welfare/families-and-children/one-parent-
family-payment/) but they will lose their Rent Supplement because they are in
full-time education.
