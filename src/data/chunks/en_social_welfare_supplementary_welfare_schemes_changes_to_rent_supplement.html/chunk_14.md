###  If you separate from your spouse, civil partner or cohabitant:

If your spouse or partner leaves the family home and you remain there with
your children, your Rent Supplement payment does not change (because the rent
limits for a one-parent family and a couple with children are the same).
However, if your partner has custody of your child(ren) for most of the time,
the rent limits applied for the family size can change (because the child(ren)
are no longer in the home full time).

If your former spouse or partner pays maintenance some of this can be assessed
in the means test for Rent Supplement. **Child maintenance payments are not
taken into account.** The first €95.23 per week of any other maintenance is
assessed in full (because it is considered to be a contribution towards your
housing expenses) and any amount above this is assessed under the additional
household income disregard - see ‘Additional household income disregard’
above.

If you do not have children and your partner leaves you, will be assessed as a
single person for Rent Supplement.

If you own your home as joint owners and the person who leaves the family home
applies for Rent Supplement, they may be refused because they are considered
to have an interest in the home. However, once a separation agreement is in
place and the home ownership issues have been resolved, the person who left
should be able to apply for Rent Supplement in their own right. They will need
to have their housing need assessed by the local authority in the usual way.
