##  Can I vote in a local election?

You do not have to be an Irish citizen to vote in a local election. However,
you must be ordinarily resident in Ireland to vote. You may not vote in both a
county council and a city council election.

To vote in a local election, you must:

  * Be over 18 years of age 
  * Live in the local electoral area 
  * Be on the electoral register
