###  Local election posters and signs

The [ Litter Pollution Act 1997
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1997/act/12/enacted/en/html) , as amended
by the [ Electoral (Amendment) (No. 2) Act 2009
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2009/act/9/enacted/en/html) allows people
to display election posters for a certain period. They can be displayed from
the date the Minister appoints the polling day by order, or 30 days before
polling day, whichever is shorter. They must be taken down within 7 days after
the polling day.

If an election poster is causing a hazard to motorists or pedestrians, you can
inform your local authority about these safety concerns.
