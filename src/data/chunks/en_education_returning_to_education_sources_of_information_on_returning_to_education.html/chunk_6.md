##  Can I get a qualification with adult education?

Yes, you can get a qualification with many adult education courses.

Getting a qualification is not always a goal for learners, but you can get
advice from your local ETB.

The [ National Framework of Qualifications (NFQ) ](https://www.qqi.ie/what-we-
do/the-qualifications-system/national-framework-of-qualifications) outlines
the levels of qualifications across the Irish education and training system.
It shows how you can move from informal education (starting with a part-time
course or evening class) to further education, and then to higher education.
