###  Buyer's survey fee

If you want, you can get your own independent survey of the property to
identify any defects. This survey is separate to the survey carried out by the
lending agency. There will be a fee for an independent survey and the cost can
vary considerably.

If you want to arrange an independent survey, you can find a surveyor on the
website of the [ Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland (SCSI)
](http://www.scsi.ie/) . The SCSI is the professional body for chartered
surveyors.
