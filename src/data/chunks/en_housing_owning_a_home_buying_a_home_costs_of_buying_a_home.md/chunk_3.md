##  Deposit

The amount of money that you can get as a mortgage loan is governed by Central
Bank lending limits, so you will need to pay the balance of the purchase price
as a deposit. In general, you will need a deposit of at least 10% of the
purchase price - and possibly more, depending on your situation. See [ Taking
out a mortgage ](/en/housing/owning-a-home/help-with-buying-a-home/taking-out-
a-mortgage/) for details of these rules.

If the [ mortgage is from a local authority ](/en/housing/owning-a-home/help-
with-buying-a-home/local-authority-mortgages/) , you also normally need to
have a deposit of 10% of the purchase price.

If you are a first-time buyer purchasing a newly built home or building your
own home, you may qualify for the [ Help-to-Buy (HTB) incentive
](/en/housing/owning-a-home/help-with-buying-a-home/help-to-buy-scheme/) which
can be used to help you with the deposit.
