###  Legal fees

There is no fixed rate of charges for [ legal fees
](https://www.lawsociety.ie/Public/Legal-guides/You--your-solicitor/Legal-
charges) . Solicitors can offer competitive rates for conveyancing work - the
legal work associated with buying a home. Some may charge a flat fee and some
may charge a percentage of the purchase price of the home. You can shop around
to [ find a solicitor ](https://www.lawsociety.ie/Find-a-Solicitor) who will
charge the lowest possible fee.

There may be other costs associated with the legal process, including [ Land
Registry ](/en/housing/owning-a-home/buying-a-home/property-deeds/) fees and
fees for legal searches. [ Value Added Tax ](/en/money-and-tax/tax/duties-and-
vat/value-added-tax/) must also be paid on the legal fees.

You can find more information about legal costs and the information your
solicitor must give you about these charges in the Legal Services Regulatory
Authorityâ€™s [ Guide to Legal Charges ](https://www.lsra.ie/for-consumers/your-
legal-bill-explained/) .
