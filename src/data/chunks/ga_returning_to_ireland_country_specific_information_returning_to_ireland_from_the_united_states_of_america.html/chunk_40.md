####  **What are the rules about deposits?**

You cannot be forced to make upfront payments of more than 2 month’s rent.
This includes a deposit of a month’s rent and one month’s rent in advance.

If you are getting a social welfare payment and are unable to pay the deposit,
the Department of Social Protection may be able to [ help with paying a
deposit ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/social-welfare-
payments/supplementary-welfare-schemes/additional-needs-payment/) .

You should get a receipt for any deposit you pay. You may lose your deposit if
you don’t give proper notice, cause damage to the property or leave without
paying bills or rent.
