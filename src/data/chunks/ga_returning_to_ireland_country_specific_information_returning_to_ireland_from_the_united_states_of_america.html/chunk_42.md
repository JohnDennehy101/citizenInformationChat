###  **Primary and post-primary education**

There are 2 types of primary schools in Ireland:

  * **National primary schools** (often called ‘national schools’) that are funded by the State and do not charge fees 
  * **Private primary schools** , which do charge fees 

Most children in Ireland go to a State-funded national primary school.

There are 3 types of post-primary or secondary schools:

  * **Voluntary secondary schools** are privately owned and managed, usually by religious institutions, a charitable trust, or a private charitable company 
  * **Community colleges** that are managed by the local Education and Training Board (ETB) 
  * **Community schools** that have been established by one or more private or religious patrons coming together and having ETB sponsorship or resulting from combining several voluntary secondary and ETB schools together 

Children usually start post-primary school when they are 12 or 13 years old.
Most children attend State-funded post-primary schools, which do not charge a
fee.
