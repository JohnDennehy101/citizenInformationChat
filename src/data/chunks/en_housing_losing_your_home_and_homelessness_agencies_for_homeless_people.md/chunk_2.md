##  Introduction

This page lists a number of agencies and organisations that provide services
to people who are homeless or at risk of homelessness. While they are listed
under the main type of service provided, many of these bodies provide multiple
supports to homeless people, including advice and information on other options
available to them.

A growing number of people are either homeless or at risk of losing their
homes. Most of them are in the cities. There are dedicated services for
homeless people in Dublin and Cork.
