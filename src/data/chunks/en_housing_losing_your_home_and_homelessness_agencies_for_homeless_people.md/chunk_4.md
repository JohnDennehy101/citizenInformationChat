###  Housing First

The [ Housing First Service ](https://www.housingagency.ie/housing-
information/housing-first) provides street outreach to people who are sleeping
rough and helps them to access emergency accommodation. It also works to
secure longer-term accommodation with wrap-around supports for people who are
sleeping rough or have been in emergency accommodation for a long time. These
wrap-around supports can include health supports to help with addiction or
mental health issues.
