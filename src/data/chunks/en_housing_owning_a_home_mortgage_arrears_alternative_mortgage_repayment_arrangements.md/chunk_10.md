###  Capitalising arrears and interest

This arrangement adds the arrears on to the outstanding mortgage balance. The
increased mortgage balance is then paid over the remaining term of the
mortgage. This may increase your monthly payments. This arrangement may be
combined with a term extension so that your monthly payments are less.
