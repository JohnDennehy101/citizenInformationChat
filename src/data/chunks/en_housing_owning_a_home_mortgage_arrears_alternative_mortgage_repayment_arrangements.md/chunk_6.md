##  What alternative repayment arrangements can I be offered?

Lenders may offer slightly different alternative repayment arrangements. There
are short-term and long-term alternative repayment arrangements. Short-term
arrangements have a specific duration and will expire. For example, a 6-month
interest-only arrangement. Long-term arrangements may run for the term of the
mortgage or extend its term. Below are some examples of alternative repayment
arrangements.
