If you are being offered an alternative repayment arrangement under the [
Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process (MARP) ](/en/housing/owning-a-
home/mortgage-arrears/mortgage-arrears-resolution-process/) , you must always
get:

A clear written explanation of how the alternative repayment arrangement works

  * The proposed new repayment amount 
  * The term of the arrangement 
  * The impact on the mortgage term 
  * The outstanding balance 
  * The existing arrears 
  * Information on how interest will be applied to your mortgage loan account as a result of this arrangement 
  * Information on how the arrangement will be reported to the Irish Credit Bureau and the subsequent impact on your [ credit record ](/en/money-and-tax/personal-finance/loans-and-credit/your-credit-history/)
  * Information on your right to appeal the lender’s decision, including how to submit an appeal 

You must also be told to get independent advice on the proposal. As part of

home/mortgage-arrears/mortgage-arrears-resolution-process/) , your lender will
pay €250 for a consultation with an accountant of your choice. You can find a
