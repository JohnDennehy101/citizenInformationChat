###  Split mortgages

If you are not able to pay your current mortgage payments, but your
circumstances may improve in the future, you may be offered a split mortgage.
A split mortgage arrangement splits the mortgage into 2 parts. You make agreed
repayments on the first part of the mortgage and the second part is warehoused
or set aside to be paid at a later date. Some lenders may write off part of
the warehoused loan, some add interest to the warehoused part of the mortgage
and others do not. The main aim of a split mortgage is to allow you to stay in
your family home.

If you are offered a split mortgage you should consider:

  * What percentage of any lump sum you may receive in the future must be paid towards the warehoused loan? For example, if you get an inheritance or a bonus. 
  * What happens when the loan reaches the date it is scheduled to be paid in full? Do you have to sell the property to repay the outstanding mortgage balance? Or will you keep a right of tenure, where the outstanding debt will only be recovered after your death?
