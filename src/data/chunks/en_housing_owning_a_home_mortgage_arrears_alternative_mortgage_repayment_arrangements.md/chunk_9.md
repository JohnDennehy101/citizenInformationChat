###  Extending the term of the mortgage

This means that your mortgage term is extended. So, you pay less each month
because you have spread the repayments over a longer period of time. The cost
of your credit will increase if you extend your mortgage, as it will take you
longer to pay your mortgage in full. Cost of credit is the difference between
the amount that you borrow and the total amount that you will repay, including
interest.

If you are thinking about extending your mortgage there are some things you
should consider including:

  * What age will you be when the mortgage expires? 
  * Do you have a compulsory retirement age, or can you continue to work beyond retirement age? 
  * If you retire before the mortgage has been paid off, will your pension or other income allow you to continue to pay the mortgage? 
  * Are you clear on what happens due to the revised term? While you may be paying less each month, your cost of credit will increase over the extended mortgage term.
