###  Mortgage to rent

Under the national [ mortgage-to-rent scheme ](/en/housing/owning-a-
home/mortgage-arrears/mortgage-to-rent-scheme/) , people who are having
trouble paying their mortgages to private lenders can switch from owning their
home to renting their home as social tenants. If you take up the mortgage-to-
rent option, you will no longer own your home or have any financial interest
in it.
