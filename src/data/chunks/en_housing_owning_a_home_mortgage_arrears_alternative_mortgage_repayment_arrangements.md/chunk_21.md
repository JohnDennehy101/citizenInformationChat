###  Personal Insolvency Arrangements (PIA) and bankruptcy

If you and your lender cannot come to an agreement on modifying or
restructuring your mortgage, you can also consider a [ Personal Insolvency
Arrangement (PIA) ](/en/money-and-tax/personal-finance/debt/personal-
insolvency/personal-insolvency-arrangements/) . Under a PIA, all of your
debts, including your mortgage, are assessed and an agreed plan is made to
repay your creditors. A PIA needs to be approved at a creditorsâ€™ meeting (by a
qualified majority of creditors). If you are in very serious financial
difficulties, [ bankruptcy ](/en/money-and-tax/personal-finance/debt/personal-
insolvency/what-is-bankruptcy/) may also be an option.
