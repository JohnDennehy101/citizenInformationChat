##  Alternative repayment arrangements and your mortgage

In general, you cannot be asked to change from an existing tracker mortgage to
another mortgage type. But if the lender considers that the tracker interest
rate is inappropriate and unsustainable for you, they may offer you an
arrangement where you change from a tracker mortgage to another mortgage type.
Your lender can only do this if the new arrangement is affordable and
sustainable over the long term.

The Central Bank's [ lending limits on mortgages ](/en/housing/owning-a-
home/help-with-buying-a-home/paying-for-a-home#l4e5b7) do not apply to the
restructuring of mortgages.
