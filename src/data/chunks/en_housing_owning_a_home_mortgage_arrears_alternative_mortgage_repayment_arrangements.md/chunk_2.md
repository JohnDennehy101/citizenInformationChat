##  What is an alternative repayment arrangement?

If you are having difficulty [ paying the mortgage ](/en/housing/owning-a-
home/help-with-buying-a-home/taking-out-a-mortgage/) on your home, your lender
may offer you an _alternative repayment arrangement_ . Alternative repayment
arrangements offer you different ways to pay your mortgage if you are in
financial difficulty. For example, you might only pay the interest on the
mortgage for a while, or you might extend the term of your mortgage to reduce
your repayments. These arrangements are often called a mortgage restructure.
The arrangements available from your lender may be part of the [ Mortgage
Arrears Resolution Process (MARP) ](/en/housing/owning-a-home/mortgage-
arrears/mortgage-arrears-resolution-process/) or outside it.

Your lender will look at your personal circumstances and choose an alternative
repayment arrangement that they think is appropriate and sustainable for you.
If your lender does not offer you an alternative repayment arrangement, or if
you cannot agree on one, you may need to consider other options, such as
selling the property or surrendering it to the lender.
