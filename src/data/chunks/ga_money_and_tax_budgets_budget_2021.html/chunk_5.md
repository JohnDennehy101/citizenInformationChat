##  COVID-19

The economy is expected to shrink 2.4% in 2020 and 1.7% in 2021 because of the
COVID-19 pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic has also meant that that many people
have lost their jobs or had to close their businesses. €8.5 billion will be
spent on supporting people and businesses affected by COVID-19. In summary,
this includes:

  * €1.9 billion for personal protective equipment (PPE) in the health sector and to increase COVID-19 testing capacity 
  * €3.2 billion to support people through the [ COVID Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP) ](/ga/social-welfare/unemployed-people/covid19-pandemic-unemployment-payment/) and the [ Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) ](/ga/employment/unemployment-and-redundancy/employment-wage-subsidy-scheme/)
  * €100 million to support [ businesses affected ](/ga/employment/types-of-employment/self-employment/covid-19-costas-aisghabhala-tacaiochtai-gno-maireachtala/) by COVID-19 
  * €2.1 billion for a ‘contingency reserve’ for use if needed 
  * Reducing VAT for the tourism and hospitality sectors from 13.5% to 9% 
  * €232 million to help schools make their classrooms safe for students 
  * €395 million to help transport services run at reduced capacity 

A **Recovery Fund** of €3.4 billion will be available to support the economy
where needed in response to both COVID-19 and Brexit (see 'Brexit
preparations' below).
