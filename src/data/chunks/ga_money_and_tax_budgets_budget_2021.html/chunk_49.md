###  Carbon tax

**Carbon tax** has been increased by €7.50 per tonne, from €26 per tonne to
€33.50 per tonne. This applies to auto fuels from **midnight on 13 October
2020** . The carbon tax increase will apply to all other fuels (including
household fuels) on 1 May 2021.

Carbon tax will increase by €7.50 every year until 2029 and then by €6.50 in
2030, bringing carbon tax to €100 per tonne by 2030. €100 million of the
carbon tax revenue collected will be invested in increasing the energy
efficiency of our homes, including expanding the [ Warmer Homes Scheme
](/ga/housing/housing-grants-and-schemes/grants-for-home-renovations-and-
improvements/warmer-homes-scheme/) and providing for new energy efficiency
schemes such as the **National Home Retrofit Scheme** . A new **National
Retrofit Office** will be established in the Sustainable Energy Authority of
Ireland (SEAI).
