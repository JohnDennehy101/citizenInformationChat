##  Consent for your child's passport

Your children must have their own passports, and cannot travel on the passport
of their parents or guardians. [ Not all children born in Ireland are
automatically Irish citizens ](/en/moving-country/irish-citizenship/irish-
citizenship-through-birth-or-descent/) .

A child’s passport can only be issued with the consent of each of the child’s
guardians. You can read [ more about the guardianship of children ](/en/birth-
family-relationships/cohabiting-couples/guardianship-and-cohabiting-couples/)
.

You can get more detailed guidance on [ how to apply for your child’s first
