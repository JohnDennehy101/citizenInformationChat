##  Where can I travel on my Irish passport?

All EU citizens have the [ right to enter and live in another EU member state
](/en/government-in-ireland/european-government/european-union/freedom-of-
movement-in-the-eu/) for up to 3 months. You just need a valid passport or
national identity card. EU member states cannot set additional conditions
concerning the minimum validity or duration of the identity card or passport.
This means that your passport doesn't have to be valid for, say, 6 months
before you are allowed to enter another EU state.

Irish citizens travelling to destinations outside the EU are subject to the
specific passport controls and requirements of those countries. You may need a
visa to travel to your destination, and/or a transit visa if you have to
transfer flights. Your passport may also need to be valid for a certain
period. These arrangements vary from one country to another, so [ contact the
embassy of the relevant country ](https://www.ireland.ie/en/dfa/embassies/)
before you travel for the most up-to-date information on these requirements.
