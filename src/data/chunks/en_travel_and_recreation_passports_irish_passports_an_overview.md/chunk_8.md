##  Can my application be refused?

If the Passport Service is not satisfied that you have proved your identity or
citizenship status, your application may be refused. However, the Passport
Service will normally contact you to request further documentation or
information before issuing a formal refusal.

Your passport application may be refused if:

  * Issuing you with a passport would pose a danger to national security, the security of another country, or might endanger public safety 
  * You provide false or misleading information or documents 
  * The courts have issued an order for the surrender of a child’s passport 
  * You already have been granted an Irish passport, and you have not given a valid reason for applying for a new Irish passport 

If your application for an Irish passport is refused, you have a right to
appeal the decision – see ‘Passport appeals’ below.
