##  Names and genders on Irish passports

In general, your passport is issued in the name and gender on your birth
certificate. However, you can request that your passport carry a different
name and/or gender for the following reasons:

  * **Marriage or civil partnership** : If you want to have your passport issued in your married or civil partnership name you should submit your civil marriage certificate or civil partnership certificate. 
  * **You are known by a different name to your birth certificate** : If the name you are known by is different from the name on your [ birth certificate ](/en/birth-family-relationships/after-your-baby-is-born/registering-birth-your-baby/) and this is **not due to marriage, civil partnership or adoption** , you have to supply documentary evidence that you have been using the name continually for at least 2 years. This applies even if you have received a [ Gender Recognition Certificate ](/en/birth-family-relationships/legal-recognition-of-preferred-gender/) . 
  * **You are known by the Irish version of your name** : If the name you are known by is the Irish version of your name but, you do not have proof of 2 years’ usage, proof of at least 6 months’ usage may be accepted. If the proof of 6 months’ usage is accepted, the English version of your name will also be noted on the passport. 
  * **Gender recognition** : You can apply in your preferred gender if you have received a [ Gender Recognition Certificate ](/en/birth-family-relationships/legal-recognition-of-preferred-gender/) from the Department of Social Protection. You need to submit your Gender Recognition Certificate and your birth certificate as re-issued after gender recognition. You also must supply documentary evidence that you have been using the name continually for at least 2 years. 

Documents that show proof of usage include driving licences, bank statements,
insurance, tax, and social welfare documents. You should include at least 2
documents with your application.

If the name on your passport is not exactly the same as the name on your birth
certificate, you can indicate on the application form that you also want your
birth certificate name noted on the passport. This is known as recording an
observation on your passport. It can help to avoid difficulties if you apply
for a visa or work permit abroad.

Titles such as Mr, Mrs, Ms, Dr, Rev., Sir, Lord, Lady are not entered on Irish
passports.
