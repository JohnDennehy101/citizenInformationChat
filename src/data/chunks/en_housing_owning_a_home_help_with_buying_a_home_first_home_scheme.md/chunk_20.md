  4. **Have your application assessed** : your application and documents will be reviewed by the FHS. 
  5. **Get your eligibility certificate** : if you qualify for the scheme, you will get an FHS eligibility certificate. This gives you an estimate of how much equity you can get from the FHS. Give the certificate to your mortgage lender to include in your mortgage application.
