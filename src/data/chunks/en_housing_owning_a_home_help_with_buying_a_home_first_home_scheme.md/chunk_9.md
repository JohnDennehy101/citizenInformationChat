###  5\. Your mortgage must be with a participating lender and you must have a
deposit

Your mortgage must be with a lender that is participating in the scheme.
Participating lenders currently include Bank of Ireland, Permanent TSB and
Allied Irish Bank which includes AIB, Haven Mortgages and EBS.

You must borrow the maximum amount available to you from one of these lenders.
Under Central Bank rules, the [ limit for mortgage borrowing
](/en/housing/owning-a-home/help-with-buying-a-home/paying-for-a-home#l4e5b7)
for first-time buyers is 4 times your gross annual income. If you are a non-
first-time home buyer, the limit is 3.5 times your gross annual income.

If you are getting a Macro Prudential Exception (MPE) with a participating
lender you will not qualify for the FHS. An MPE is when your lender lets you
borrow above the Central Bank limits. Lenders have flexibility to do this for
a certain percentage of the mortgages they provide.

You must have a deposit of at least 10%. If you are buying, this is 10% of the
propertyâ€™s purchase price. If you are availing of the Help to Buy Scheme, this
can contribute towards the deposit you need.

If you are building your home, this is 10% of the build cost. You can use the
equity in your site to contribute to the deposit if you are building your
home.

There is an [ eligibility calculator

Scheme website to help you see if you qualify.
