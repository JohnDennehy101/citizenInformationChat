##  What is the First Home Scheme?

The First Home Scheme (FHS) is an affordable housing scheme, which supports
you to buy a new home or to build your first home.

The FHS is a shared equity scheme. This means that the government and
participating banks pay up to 30% of the cost of your new home in return for a
stake in the home. If you want, you can buy back the stake at any time, but
you donâ€™t have to.
