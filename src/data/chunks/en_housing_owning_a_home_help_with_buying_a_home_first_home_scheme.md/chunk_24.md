###  Local authority affordable housing scheme

There is a [ Local Authority Affordable Purchase Scheme
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/housing/owning-a-home/help-with-
buying-a-home/local-authority-affordable-purchase-scheme/) , which is similar
to the First Home Scheme. With this scheme the local authority buys a stake in
your home instead of the banks. However, this scheme only applies in certain
areas.
