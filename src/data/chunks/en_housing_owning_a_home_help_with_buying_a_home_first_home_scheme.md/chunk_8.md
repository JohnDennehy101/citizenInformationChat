###  4\. Your home must be within the price limits for your area

Your new home must cost less than the price limit for your local authority
area. These limits are different depending on where you buy or build your
home. The limits are also different if you are buying a house or apartment.

The limits are linked to the average price for first-time buyers in each area.
They are reviewed regularly and changed if needed. You can find the current
limits in the table below, or on the [ FHS website
](https://www.firsthomescheme.ie/about-the-scheme/property-price-ceilings/) .
