###  Who can access the First Home Scheme?

The scheme is available nationwide for:

  * First-time buyers and certain other people who want to buy a new home 
  * People who want to build their first home on their own site, and certain other people who want to build a new home. (The scheme was extended to people building their own new homes in September 2023.) 
  * People who want to buy the home they are renting because their landlord is selling the property. This version of the FHS is known as the [ Tenant Home Purchase Scheme ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/housing/owning-a-home/help-with-buying-a-home/first-home-scheme/#9ba7dc) .
