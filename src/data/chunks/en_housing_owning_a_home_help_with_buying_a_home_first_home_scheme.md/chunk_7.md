###  3\. You must live in the property and it must be new

The scheme only applies if you are buying or building the property as your
home. You must live in it as your only place of residence.

If you are buying a property, it must be a newly-built home in a private
development.

If you are building your own home:

  * The property must be built on a site that you own or are buying 
  * The property must be a detached or semi-detached house 
  * The build must be managed by you or a contractor 

The scheme does not cover second-hand homes, unless [ your landlord is selling
the property you are renting and you want to buy it
