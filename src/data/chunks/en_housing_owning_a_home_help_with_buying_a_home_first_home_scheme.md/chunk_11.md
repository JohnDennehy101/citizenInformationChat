###  Are there any charges?

There is no charge for the First Home Scheme for the first 5 years that you
own your home. But, if you have not bought out the FHS equity share in your
home by the sixth year, a service charge will apply. This service charge is
for the maintenance of the First Home Scheme. It is a percentage of the amount
the FHS paid when you bought the home. The service charge amounts increase the
longer you stay in the scheme. They are:

  * 1.75% for years 6 to 15 
  * 2.15% for years 16 to 29 
  * 2.85% for years 30 and over 

These rates are fixed for the life of the equity facility.

You can pay the service charge annually or in monthly instalments. If you
canâ€™t afford the service charge you can pay a reduced amount, pause the
payments for a set amount of time or defer them altogether.

There is no additional cost for deferring the service charge, but it will
eventually need to be paid. For example, it will need to be paid if you want
to pay back the equity share, to sell the home or if you die.
