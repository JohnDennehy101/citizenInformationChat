##  Can I buy back the equity share in my home?

You can buy back the equity share in your home at any time. But you don’t have
to.

You can buy back the full equity share in one payment, or pay it back
partially as you can afford to. However, the minimum amount you can pay back
is 5% of the original equity amount and you can only make 2 partial payments a
year.

The equity share in your home is a percentage of the market value of your
home. So, if property prices increase, the amount you have to pay back will
increase.

For example, if you bought your property in 2022 for €300,000 and the FHS
provided equity of 10% or €30,000 and you want to buy back the equity share in
2025 when the property is valued at €350,000, you will have to pay 10% of
this, which is €35,000.
