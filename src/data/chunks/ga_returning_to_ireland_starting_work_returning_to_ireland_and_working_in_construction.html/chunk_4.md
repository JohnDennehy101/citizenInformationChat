###  **Apprenticeships**

If you are interested in a construction job, but donâ€™t have training yet, you
can do an apprenticeship in an area that interests you. An apprenticeship
involves learning on-the-job while having an employment contract and getting
paid a salary. There is also off-the-job training in an education centre.
