##  How much is the new mortgage interest tax credit?

You can get a mortgage interest tax credit on the increased interest you paid
on your mortgage in 2023 when compared with the amount you paid in 2022. The
tax credit is 20% of the increase, which is the standard income tax rate. The
credit is capped at €1,250.

For example, John has a qualifying loan on a property. On 31 December 2022,
John had an outstanding mortgage balance of €200,000. John’s loan was in place
for all of 2022 and 2023. In 2023, John paid €12,000 in interest on his
qualifying loan. In 2022, John paid €9,000 in interest on his qualifying loan.
John paid €3,000 more in mortgage interest in 2023 than in 2022. John's
Mortgage Interest Tax Credit is 20% of €3,000 = €600
