###  **Your tax**

  * You must comply with your [ Local Property Tax ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/money-and-tax/tax/housing-taxes-and-reliefs/local-property-tax/) obligations 
  * You must have paid income tax to get the Mortgage Interest Tax Credit, as the credit reduces the tax you pay 

If you don’t qualify because you haven’t paid enough income tax, you may be
able to get the [ Homeowner’s Once-Off Payment
](https://www.gov.ie/en/service/5157e-homeowners-once-off-payment/) instead.
See, ‘ [ What if I don’t qualify for the mortgage interest tax credit
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/housing/owning-a-home/buying-a-
home/mortgage-interest-relief/#64cf49) ?’ below for more information about
this payment.
