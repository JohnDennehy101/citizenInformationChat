##  What is a mortgage interest tax credit or relief?

A mortgage interest tax credit or relief is a tax relief based on the amount
of qualifying mortgage interest that you pay in a tax year for your home.

To qualify for a tax credit on mortgage interest repayments, you must have
paid interest on money that you borrowed to purchase, repair, develop or
improve your main residence.
