###  Can I ‘carry over’ annual leave to next year?

Annual leave should be taken within the leave year (see above). Depending on
your employer, you can agree to take your annual leave **within 6 months** of
the relevant leave year.

Any further carrying-over (also called _holding over_ ) of annual leave would
need to be agreed between you and your employer.
