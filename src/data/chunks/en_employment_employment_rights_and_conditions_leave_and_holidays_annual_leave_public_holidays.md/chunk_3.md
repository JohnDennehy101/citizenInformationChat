###  Annual leave and other types of leave

Annual leave is not affected by other types of _statutory leave_ (that means
leave provided for by law). Time spent on [ maternity leave
](/en/employment/employment-rights-and-conditions/leave-and-
holidays/maternity-leave/) , [ paternity leave ](/en/employment/employment-
rights-and-conditions/leave-and-holidays/paternity-leave/) , [ adoptive leave
](/en/employment/employment-rights-and-conditions/leave-and-holidays/adoptive-
leave/) , [ parental leave ](/en/employment/employment-rights-and-
conditions/leave-and-holidays/parental-leave/) , force majeure leave and the
first 13 weeks of [ carer's leave ](/en/employment/employment-rights-and-
conditions/leave-and-holidays/carers-leave/) is treated as though you have
been in employment. For example, time spent on parental leave can be used to
_accrue_ (build up) your annual leave entitlement - see â€˜Calculating your
annual leave' below.
