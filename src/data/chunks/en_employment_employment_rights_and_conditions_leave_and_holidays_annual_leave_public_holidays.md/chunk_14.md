###  Carrying over your holidays

If you are on long-term sick leave and cannot take your annual leave due to
illness, you can carry it over for up to 15 months after the end of the year
it was earned.

If you leave your job within these 15 months, you should get payment instead
of the leave you did not take due to illness.

These protections are set out in an [ amendment
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2015/act/16/section/86/enacted/en/html)
to the Workplace Relations Act 2015.
