##  What is direct provision?

Direct provision is the name used to describe the accommodation, food, money
and medical services you get while your [ international protection application
](/en/moving-country/asylum-seekers-and-refugees/the-asylum-process-in-
ireland/applying-for-refugee-status-in-ireland/) is being assessed or while
you are an asylum seeker, which means the same thing.

You might get direct provision if you have applied for international
protection and are waiting for:

  * Your first decision 
  * The [ result of an appeal ](/en/moving-country/asylum-seekers-and-refugees/the-asylum-process-in-ireland/if-your-application-for-refugee-status-is-refused/) to the International Protection Appeals Tribunal 
  * A [ judicial review ](/en/government-in-ireland/how-government-works/standards-and-accountability/judicial-review-public-decisions/) (where the High Court looks at how a decision on your application was made) 
  * A decision on whether you will be given leave to remain 
  * A deportation 

You do not have to accept direct provision. If you decide to live somewhere
else, you will not get any state assistance (for example, social welfare or
help with housing costs).

Your direct provision normally ends if the Department of Justice gives you a [
refugee ](/en/moving-country/asylum-seekers-and-refugees/the-asylum-process-
in-ireland/refugees-asylum-seekers-introduction#lad40a) , or [ subsidiary
protection ](/en/moving-country/asylum-seekers-and-refugees/the-asylum-
process-in-ireland/refugees-asylum-seekers-introduction#l50016) declaration or
[ permission to remain ](/en/moving-country/asylum-seekers-and-
refugees/refugee-status-and-leave-to-remain/permission-to-remain/) , but
sometimes you can stay in direct provision temporarily while you are looking
for your own place to live.
