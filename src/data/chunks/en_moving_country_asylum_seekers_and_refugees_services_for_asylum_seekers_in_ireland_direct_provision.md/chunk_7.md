####  DEA income test

From June 2024, the Department of Social Protection (DSP) will check that you
continue to qualify for DEA, if you are:

  * Age 18 or over **and**
  * Getting an income for 12 weeks or more 

Income includes pay from a job, self-employment and social welfare payments.

How your income can affect your DEA payment:

**Your weekly income** |  **Daily Expenses Allowance (DEA)**  
---|---  
€60 or less  |  No change to DEA   
€61 - €124  |  [ Reduced rate of DEA ](https://www.gov.ie/en/service/ba5ad9-daily-expenses-allowance/#income-assessment)  
€125 or more  |  DEA payment will stop   
  
If your DEA is reduced or stopped, it will not affect the DEA payment to your
other family members.

If you are getting a DEA and have additional income, you should email
NWCWS@welfare.ie.
