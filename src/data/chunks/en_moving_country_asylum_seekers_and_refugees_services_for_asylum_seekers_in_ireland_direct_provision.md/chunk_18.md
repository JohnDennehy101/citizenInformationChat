##  A new system to replace direct provision

The Irish Government plans to replace direct provision with a new [
International Protection Support Service
](https://www.gov.ie/en/campaigns/60714-international-protection-support-
service/) .

Under the plan, applicants for international protection will stay in a
‘reception and integration centre’ for no more than 4 months and all current
direct provision centres will close by the end of 2024.

You can read more about the plans in the [ White Paper on Ending Direct
Provision ](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/7aad0-minister-ogorman-
