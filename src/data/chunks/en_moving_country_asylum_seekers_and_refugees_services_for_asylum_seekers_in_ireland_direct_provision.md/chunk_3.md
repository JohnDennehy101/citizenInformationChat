##  What will I get in direct provision?

When you [ apply for international protection ](/en/moving-country/asylum-
seekers-and-refugees/the-asylum-process-in-ireland/applying-for-refugee-
status-in-ireland/) , also called _claiming asylum_ , the International
Protection Office (IPO) must process your application. This sometimes takes a
long time.

While you are waiting, you can get direct provision. This means that you get:

  * Somewhere to live 
  * Meals 
  * A Daily Expenses Allowance (DEA) – see ‘Social welfare payments’ below 
  * A [ medical card ](/en/health/medical-cards-and-gp-visit-cards/medical-card/)

Since January 2023, applicants for international protection who do not have
children are not prioritised for accommodation. You can read more about [ how
international protection applicants are prioritised for accommodation
](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/e202e-statistics-on-international-
protection-applicants-not-offered-accommodation/) .

When you apply for international protection, you will give your contact
details. When accommodation is available, IPAS will contact you.

If IPAS is unable to provide you with accommodation, you will get a temporary
increase of your Daily Expense Allowance (DEA).

international protection applicants.
