###  Social welfare payments

You get a weekly social welfare payment, called a [ Daily Expenses Allowance
](https://www.gov.ie/en/service/ba5ad9-daily-expenses-allowance/) (DEA), while
you are in direct provision. To get a DEA, your income must be under a certain
amount – see ‘DEA income test’ below.

**DEA rates in 2024:**

  * €38.80 for each adult 
  * €29.80 for each child 

If IPAS is unable to provide you with accommodation, you will get a temporary
increase of €75 in your Daily Expense Allowance (DEA). This means your DEA
will increase from €38.80 a week to €113.80 a week.
