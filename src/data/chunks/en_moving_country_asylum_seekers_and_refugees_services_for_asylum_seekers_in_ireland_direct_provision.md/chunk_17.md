##  Complaints about direct provision

You should first make your complaint to the manager of the reception centre
where you are living. You should talk to the manager first to see if they can
resolve your complaint. You can make a complaint in writing if you are not
satisfied.

If you are not happy with the outcome of your complaint to the reception
centre, [ you can complain
](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/e0f1a-international-protection-
accommodation-service-ipas-complaints-procedure/) to the International
Protection Accommodation Service (IPAS).

You can contact the [ Office of the Ombudsman
](https://www.ombudsman.ie/publications/information-leaflets/the-ombudsman-
and-direct/) if you are still not satisfied. The Ombudsman cannot investigate
decisions about your international protection application. You should send
your complaint within 12 months of the action or decision that you want to
complain about. Even if more than 12 months has passed, the Ombudsman may
still be able to help if there is a good reason for the delay.

If the complaint relates to a child, you should complain to the [ Ombudsman
for Childrenâ€™s Office (OCO) ](https://www.oco.ie/complaints/) .
