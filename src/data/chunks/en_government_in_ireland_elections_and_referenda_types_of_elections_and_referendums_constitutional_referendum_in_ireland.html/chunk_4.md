##  Ordinary referendum

An ordinary referendum is one that does not relate to amending [ Bunreacht na
hÉireann (the Irish Constitution) ](/en/government-in-ireland/irish-
constitution-1/constitution-introduction/) . To date no ordinary referendum
has ever been held.

An ordinary referendum would take place if the [ President ](/en/government-
in-ireland/houses-of-the-oireachtas/president-introduction-to-the-president-
of-ireland/) received a joint petition from both houses of the [ Oireachtas
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/government_in_ireland/houses_of_the_oireachtas/)
. The petition would say that a proposed Bill was of such national importance
that the people of Ireland should decide whether it became law.

The joint petition must be passed by the majority of the members of the [
Seanad ](/en/government-in-ireland/houses-of-the-oireachtas/the-seanad/) and
one-third of the members of the [ Dáil ](/en/government-in-ireland/houses-of-
the-oireachtas/dail-eireann/) . When the President receives the petition, they
must consult the [ Council of State ](https://president.ie/en/the-
president/council-of-state) . If the President agrees that the proposal is of
such national importance they will refuse to sign the Bill until a referendum
has been held.

The referendum must be held within 18 months of the President's decision not
to sign the Bill.
