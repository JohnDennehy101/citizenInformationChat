##  Results

The day after the poll, the votes for and against the referendum proposal are
counted and the Local Returning Officer reports the result to the Referendum
Returning Officer. The counting may be watched by members of the Oireachtas
and [ approved bodies ](https://www.refcom.ie/the-commission/approved-bodies/)
.

When the results from all constituencies have been counted, the Referendum
Returning Officer draws up a provisional referendum certificate. This states
the overall result of the voting and if the proposed amendment has been
approved, which requires more than 50% of the votes to be “Yes.” The
provisional certificate is published in [ Iris Oifigiúil (the State Gazette)
](http://www.irisoifigiuil.ie/) .

The voting procedure at the ordinary referendum is the same as in a
constitutional referendum except that bill is rejected by the people if:

  * The majority of the votes cast are against the Bill and 
  * Those votes make up at least one-third of the presidential electors on the register of electors. 

If a voter wants to challenge the provisional certificate, they must present a
petition to the High Court within 7 days of the publication of the provisional
certificate. If no petition is presented to the High Court, the certificate
becomes final.
