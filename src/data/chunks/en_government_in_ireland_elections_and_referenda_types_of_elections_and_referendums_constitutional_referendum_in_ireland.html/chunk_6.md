###  Work of the Electoral Commission

The Electoral Commissionâ€™s role in referendums is to prepare impartial and
unbiased information about the referendum proposal and make that information
available to the public.

It prepares statements on the main issues and distributes those statements
through television, radio and other forms of media to bring them to the
attention of the public. The role of the Commission includes ensuring that the
statements are accessible for those with a sight or hearing disability.
