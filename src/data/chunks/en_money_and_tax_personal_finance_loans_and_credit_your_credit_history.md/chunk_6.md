##  What is the Central Credit Register?

The [ Central Credit Register ](https://www.centralcreditregister.ie/)
provides credit reports to borrowers and lenders. It is a database that stores
personal and credit information on loans of â‚¬500 or more. It is operated by
the Central Bank of Ireland.

The Central Credit Register started to record loans from 30 June 2017. It
keeps a record for 5 years after the last payment for a loan is made.

The Central Credit Register does not decide whether you get a loan. Lenders
use the credit report to assess your loan application. They may also take into
consideration your income and expenses, such as rent and utilities. Different
lenders have different criteria for approving loans.

**The Irish Credit Bureau**

The Irish Credit Bureau (ICB) provided a credit rating service until 30
September 2021. It was a private organisation owned by its members, mainly
financial institutions. The ICB deleted its records after it stopped providing
the service.
