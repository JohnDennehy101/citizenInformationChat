###  What happens if you are refused a loan?

If you are refused a loan because of information in your credit report, the
lender must tell you this.

This applies to personal [ consumer credit agreements ](/en/money-and-
tax/personal-finance/debt/glossary-of-debt-terms/) for amounts between €200
and €75,000. It does not apply to mortgages.
