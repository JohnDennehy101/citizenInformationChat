####  Add a statement to your credit report

You can [ add a personal statement to your credit record to clarify it (pdf)
](https://www.centralcreditregister.ie/media/1730/3-placing-an-explanatory-
statement-on-my-credit-report-final.pdf) . This is known as an ‘explanatory
statement’.

For example, if you have had significant expenses due to relationship
breakdown, bereavement, illness or another cause, you may add these details to
your record.

The statement must be factual, relevant to the information in the credit
report, and under 200 words. It should not contain information that could
identify another individual (such as their name or workplace).

The statement is added to your credit report and it can be viewed when your
data is accessed. However, lenders do not have to take your statement into
account when assessing you for a loan.
