###  **Non-scheduled offences**

Any case that is not on the list of scheduled offences above can be heard in
the Special Criminal Court, if the DPP believes the ordinary courts would be

You can appeal a conviction or sentence by a Special Criminal Court to the [
Court of Appeal ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/justice/courts-
