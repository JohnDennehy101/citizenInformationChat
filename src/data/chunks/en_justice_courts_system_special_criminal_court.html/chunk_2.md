##  Introduction

The Special Criminal Court is different from the other criminal courts dealing
with serious crimes because it sits with 3 judges and no jury. Other serious
crimes are dealt with by a judge and a jury.

It only deals with certain criminal cases. It hears cases about paramilitary,
subversive and organised crimes, but much of its workload now involves
organised crime cases.

Since 2016, there are 2 courts dealing with matters referred to the Special
Criminal Court.

The Special Criminal Courts were set up under the [ Offences Against the State
Act 1939 ](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1939/act/13/enacted/en/html) .
