##  How the Special Criminal Court works

The [ Director of Public Prosecutions ](/en/justice/law-enforcement/director-
of-public-prosecutions/) sends cases to the Special Criminal Court when she
certifies that the ordinary courts are unable to ensure the effective
administration of justice and unable to keep public peace and order.

A panel of serving judges from the High Court, Circuit Court and District
Court are appointed to the Special Criminal Courts.

You can appeal a conviction or sentence by a Special Criminal Court to the [
Court of Appeal ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/justice/courts-
system/court-of-appeal/) .
