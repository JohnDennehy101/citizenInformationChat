##  Funeral costs

Funeral costs can vary widely depending on what you choose and depending on
whether it is a city or country funeral (rural funeral costs are generally
less expensive).

If you need financial support, you may be eligible for an [ Additional Needs
Payment ](/en/social-welfare/supplementary-welfare-schemes/additional-needs-
payment/) . This is a single payment to help with essential, once-off,
exceptional costs (which you could not reasonably cover with your weekly
income). This payment is means tested. This means you will have to give
information about how much income you have, including savings and insurance
policies that the deceased family member may have had to cover funeral costs.
