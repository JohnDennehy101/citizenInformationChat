###  How to apply for an Exceptional Needs Payment

Ideally, you should apply for funeral assistance before the funeral takes
place. If not, you should apply as soon as possible afterwards.

You will need [ Personal Public Service (PPS) numbers ](/en/social-
welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/personal-public-service-number/) for
yourself, your spouse, civil partner or cohabitant and your children.

You will also need evidence of any income or social welfare assistance you are
getting (such as a bank statement).
