###  Home burials

It is possible to bury a loved one outside an official graveyard, for example,
on family land. However, it is very difficult to do so. It is wise to sort
this out well in advance of the death, as it may be impossible to organise it
legally at short notice. You will need a visit from an Environmental Health
Inspector from the local authority's health department who must determine
whether the proposed burial site will pollute any water sources or drainage
channels and will be located down to a depth of eight feet.

You should [ contact your local authority

details.
