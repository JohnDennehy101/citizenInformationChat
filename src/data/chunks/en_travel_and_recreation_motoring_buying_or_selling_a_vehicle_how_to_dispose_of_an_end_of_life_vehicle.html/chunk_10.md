##  Offences for illegally disposing of an end-of-life vehicle

You are committing a criminal offence if you (or an authorised treatment
facility) dispose of an end-of-life vehicle illegally.

If you do not take your car to an authorised treatment facility, you can be
fined €100. If you don’t follow the rules about getting rid of your old car,
like getting a certificate that says it was destroyed, you might have to pay a
fine of €1000.
