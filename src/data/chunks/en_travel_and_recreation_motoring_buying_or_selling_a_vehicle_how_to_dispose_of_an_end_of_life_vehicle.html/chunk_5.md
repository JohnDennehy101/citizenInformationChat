##  What services must an authorised treatment facility provide?

An operator of an authorised end-of-life vehicle treatment facility must:

  * Issue the registered owner with a certificate of destruction (either electronically or in paper form) 
  * Make sure the facility is operated under an appropriate waste licence or permit 
  * Meet the minimum technical requirements for the storage, treatment and recovery of end-of-life vehicles and the storage of components containing fluids, spare parts, etc 
  * Keep records of end-of-life vehicle materials for reuse, recycling, recovery and disposal and report these records to local authorities annually 

The vehicle must be _treated_ within 10 days of being deposited at the
facility.

Treating the vehicle includes:

  * Removing the battery or batteries 
  * Removing the liquefied gas tank 
  * Removing (or neutralising) potentially explosive parts (including air bags) 
  * Removing, collecting, and storing fuel, oils, and other fluids (for example, brake fluid) 
  * Removing any parts containing mercury 

All other parts of the car should, where possible, be recycled.
