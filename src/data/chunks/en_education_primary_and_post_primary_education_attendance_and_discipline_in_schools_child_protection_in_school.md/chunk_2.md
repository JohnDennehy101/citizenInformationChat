##  What is child protection?

Schools have a general  duty of care to their students  .

The [ stay safe programme ](http://www.staysafe.ie/) assists teachers to help
children in primary school to develop their self-esteem and the necessary
skills to cope with possible threats to their personal safety both within and
outside the school.

Schools have a statutory responsibility under the [ Children First Act 2015
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2015/act/36/enacted/en/html) and must
develop specific policies and procedures on how to create a safe environment
to prevent deliberate harm or abuse to the children using their services.

Registered teachers are also _mandated persons_ under the Children First Act
2015. A _mandated person_ is a person who has ongoing contact with children
and families and because of their qualifications, training and experience is
in a key position to protect children from harm.
