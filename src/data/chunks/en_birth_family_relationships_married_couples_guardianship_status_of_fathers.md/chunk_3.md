As well as fathers, certain other people may apply to the court for
guardianship:

  * A step-parent, a civil partner or a person who has cohabited with a parent for not less than 3 years may apply to the court to become a guardian where they have co-parented the child for more than 2 years. 
  * A person who has provided for the childâ€™s day-to-day care for a continuous period of more than a year may apply for guardianship if the child has no parent or guardian who is willing or able to exercise the rights and responsibilities of guardianship. 

A father appointed as guardian by the court may be removed as guardian at a
future date whereas a father married to the mother of the child is normally
guardian for life.
