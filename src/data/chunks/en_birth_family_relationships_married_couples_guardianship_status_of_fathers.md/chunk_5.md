##  Temporary guardianship

Also a parent can [ nominate a temporary guardian (pdf)
](https://www.treoir.ie/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/nomination-form.pdf) using
a special form who can be appointed by the court if they are suffering from a
serious illness or injury which prevents them from exercising their
guardianship responsibilities in respect of their child. The scope of
temporary guardian’s rights will be set out in the District Court’s Order,
which will usually be identical to the wishes you set out in the form.

Further information on the rights and responsibilities of fathers is available
from [ Treoir ](https://www.treoir.ie/groups/father/) .
