###  The bystander test

For the offence of riot, violent disorder or affray, the _bystander test_ is
applied. This means that if a bystander was present at the scene of the event
or offence while it is being committed, they would fear for their own safety
or the safety of someone else. No one needs to actually be present for the
offence to be committed.
