##  Surrender and seizure of intoxicating liquor

The Intoxicating Liquor Acts set out the rules regarding the serving and sale
of alcohol in Ireland. You can read more about [ the law on alcohol
](/en/justice/criminal-law/criminal-offences/alcohol-and-the-law/) .

[ Section 22 of the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1994/en/act/pub/0002/sec0022.html) gives the
Gardaí the power to search a person going to an event where a barrier has been
erected. If the person insists on attending the event, the Gardaí may seize
intoxicating liquor or any disposable container or any other article which
could be used to cause injury.

This law also allows a Garda to refuse to allow someone to proceed to the
event where they refuse to surrender or give up the intoxicating liquor,
disposable container or other article concerned. The Gardaí may also require
that you to leave the area in an orderly and peaceful manner.

If you fail to comply with such a request by the Garda without lawful
authority or reasonable excuse then you will be guilty of an offence and
liable for a class D fine.
