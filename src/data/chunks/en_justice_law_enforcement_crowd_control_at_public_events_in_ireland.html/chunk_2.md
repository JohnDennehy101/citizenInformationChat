##  Introduction

Every year many concerts, festivals, public meetings and major events take
place in Ireland. Article 40 of [ Bunreacht na hEireann (the Irish
Constitution) ](/en/government-in-ireland/irish-constitution-1/constitution-
introduction/) guarantees your right to assemble or meet peacefully and
without weapons.

However, this right is limited by legislation to protect public order and
morality. The law as discussed below prevents or controls meetings that are
calculated or designed to cause a riot or breach of the peace. You can read
more about [ public order offences ](/en/justice/criminal-law/criminal-
offences/public-order-offenses-in-ireland/) .

The purpose of crowd control at public events is to maintain public peace and
order and ensure the safety of all who are gathered. Part III of the [
Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1994/act/2/enacted/en/html) gives the
Garda Síochána (Irish police force) clear and comprehensive legal powers to
deal with crowd control.
