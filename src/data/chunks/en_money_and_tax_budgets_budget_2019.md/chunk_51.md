##  Travel, tourism and sport

The **VAT rate on goods and services in the tourism sector** will increase
from to 13.5% (from January 2019).

€35m is allocated to the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport to provide
**targeted supports for the tourism sector** , including €4.5 million for
regional initiatives such as Ireland’s Hidden Heartlands and the Wild Atlantic
Way, and nearly €10 million for the further development of the greenways.

Vehicle Registration Tax (VRT) relief available for **hybrid electric
vehicles** is being extended until the end of 2019.

A 1% VRT surcharge (applied across all VRT bands) is being introduced for
diesel engine passenger vehicles registered in the State (from 1 January
2019).

The 0% benefit-in-kind rate for electric vehicles introduced in Budget 2018 is
being extended for a period of 3 years, with a cap of €50,000 on the Original
Market Value of the vehicle.

A new capital allowances scheme is announced for gas-propelled vehicles and
refuelling equipment to encourage the uptake of gas-propelled commercial
vehicles as an alternative to diesel. The use of natural gas and biogas as a
substitute for diesel is seen as a more environmentally friendly fuel for
large vehicles such as HGVs and buses.

The Dublin Airport Authority (DAA) is investing €320 million to enhance
capacity at **Dublin Airport** and €587 million will be invested in the ports
of **Dublin, Cork and Shannon Foynes** to enhance national and international

increasing participation in sport and supporting high-performance sport.
