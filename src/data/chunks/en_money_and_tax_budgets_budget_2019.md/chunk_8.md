###  Universal Social Charge (USC)

The 4.75% rate of USC will reduce to 4.5%.

The ceiling of the 2% band will increase from €19,372 to €19,874, so that the
salary of a full-time worker on the minimum wage will remain outside the
higher rates of USC.

Incomes of €13,000 or less will continue to be exempt from USC in 2019. Once
your income is over this limit, the following rates will apply (from 1 January
2019):

  * €0 to €12,012 @ 0.5% 
  * €12,012 to €19,874 @ 2% 
  * €19,874 to €70,044 @ 4.5% 
  * €70,044+ @ 8% 
  * Self-employed income over €100,000: 3% surcharge 

The weekly income threshold for the higher rate of employer’s PRSI will
increase from €376 to €386 to ensure that there is no incentive to reduce the
working hours for a full-time employee on the increased minimum wage.
