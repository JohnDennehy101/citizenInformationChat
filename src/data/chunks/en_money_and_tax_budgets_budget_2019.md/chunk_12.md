###  Tobacco products tax

From midnight on 9 October 2018, the excise duty on a packet of 20 cigarettes
will increase by 50 cent (including VAT) with a pro-rata increase on other
tobacco products. There will be an additional 25 cent on roll-your-own
tobacco.

There is an increase in the minimum excise duty on tobacco products, so that
all cigarettes sold below €11 have the same excise applied as those sold at
€11 and above.
