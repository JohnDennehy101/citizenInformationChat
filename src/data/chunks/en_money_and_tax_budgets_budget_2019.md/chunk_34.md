###  Private rented housing

The interest relief that landlords can claim against mortgages used to buy,
improve or repair a rental property has increased from 85% to 100%. (This will
be effective from 1 January 2019).

An additional €4.6 million will be provided to the **Residential Tenancies
Board (RTB)** in 2019, bringing its allocation to €11.5 million. This increase
will help the RTB to enforce rent caps and expand its programme of rental
inspections.

The **Housing Agency** will also receive additional funding of €2.8 million,
bringing its funding for 2019 to €10 million. This additional budget reflects
the Housing Agency’s expanded role in the delivery of housing supports and
services.
