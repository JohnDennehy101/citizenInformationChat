##  Student Grant Scheme

The [ Student Grant Scheme ](/en/education/third-level-education/fees-and-
supports-for-third-level-education/student-grant-scheme/) is the main
financial support scheme for students studying in Ireland and abroad. It is
also known as the SUSI grant.

Student grants are divided into:

  * Maintenance grants 
  * Fee grants 

Maintenance grants help students with their living costs. Fee grants pay
tuition fees for students who do not qualify for the [ Free Fees Scheme
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/education/third-level-education/fees-
and-supports-for-third-level-education/fees/) .

Fee grants can also pay the Student Contribution and the cost of essential
field trips.

To qualify for the grant, you must meet certain conditions.
