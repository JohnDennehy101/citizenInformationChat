###  **Means test for Teagasc maintenance grant**

The means test for the Teagasc maintenance grant has the same income limits as
the [ one for the Student Grant Scheme
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/education/third-level-education/fees-
and-supports-for-third-level-education/student-grant-scheme/#19584a) .
However, the way your reckonable income is calculated is slightly different.
So, you cannot apply to Student Universal Support Ireland (SUSI) to be means
tested for a Teagasc Student Maintenance Grant.

Similarly to SUSI, Teagasc looks at all your ’reckonable income’ when
assessing your Teagasc student grant application. Reckonable income is gross
income from all sources. Some social welfare payments and financial support
payments are excluded - see [ more details on reckonable income on the SUSI
website ](https://www.susi.ie/eligibility-criteria/income/index.html) .
