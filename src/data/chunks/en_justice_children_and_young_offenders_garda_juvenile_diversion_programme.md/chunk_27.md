###  What is in an action plan

An action plan may include:

  * An apology (verbally or in writing or both) by the child to the victim 
  * Financial or other reparation to any victim 
  * Participation by the child in a suitable sporting or recreational activity 
  * Attendance by the child at school or a place of work 
  * Participation by the child in a suitable training, educational course or a programme that does not interfere with any work or school schedule of the child 
  * The child being at home at certain times 
  * The child staying away from specific places or people (or both) 
  * Initiatives within the child’s family and community to help prevent the child committing further offences or anti-social behaviour 
  * Any other matter in the child’s best interests or would make the child more aware of the consequences of their behaviour. 

**Action plan start and review dates**

The final agreed action plan starts on the date it is signed by the
facilitator, the child (if possible) and one other person present.

The action plan is reviewed at any time within six months from the date the
plan is signed.

The conference and any action plan are reported to the Director of the
Diversion Programme. The Director then decides if they need to vary any period
of supervision.
