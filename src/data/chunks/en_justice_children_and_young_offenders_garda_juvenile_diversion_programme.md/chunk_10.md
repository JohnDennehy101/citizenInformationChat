###  **Before admission to the programme**

A Garda investigating the young person's behaviour assesses if the person is
suitable for inclusion in the programme and prepares a report.

Before the young person is considered for admission, they must:

  * Admit responsibility for their criminal or anti-social behaviour 
  * Consent to be admitted to the programme 
  * Consent to be supervised by JLO, if necessary 

Itâ€™s important to note, the final decision of whether or not a young person is
cautioned lies not with the Director of the Diversion Programme and not with
the referring Garda.
