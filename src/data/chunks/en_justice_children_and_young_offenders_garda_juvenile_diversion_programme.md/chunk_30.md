###  Schools Programme

The Gardaí run the Schools Programme to discourage young people at school
becoming involved in criminal behaviour.

Gardaí visit classrooms and run projects and trips with pupils in 5th class in
[ primary schools ](/en/education/primary-and-post-primary-education/going-to-
primary-school/starting-primary-school/) .

A programme for [ post-primary schools ](/en/education/primary-and-post-
primary-education/going-to-post-primary-school/starting-post-primary-school/)
has been developed to run alongside the [ Social, Personal and Health
Education syllabus for Junior Cycle ](/en/education/primary-and-post-primary-
education/going-to-post-primary-school/junior-cycle/) .

As well as making young people aware of the dangers of criminal behaviour, the
Schools Programme shows children the positive side of the work of the Gardaí
and encourages good relations between pupils and the Gardaí.
