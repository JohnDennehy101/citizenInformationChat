###  Mandatory retirement age

Most contracts of employment have a mandatory retirement age (the age at which
you must retire). This is usually 65. Many employment contracts, however,
allow for early retirement from 60 (or in some cases, from 55). Most also
allow for early retirement on health grounds.
