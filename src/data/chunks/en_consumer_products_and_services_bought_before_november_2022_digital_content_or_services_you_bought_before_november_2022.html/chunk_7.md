##  Faulty digital content

Before 1 November 2022, there were no explicit consumer rules on digital
content. This makes it difficult to take action against the seller if the
product is faulty or is not of the quality that you would reasonably expect.

From 1 November 2022, there are new rules which give you a right to a refund,
repair, replacement or price reduction for [ digital content or service that
is not as described or faulty ](/en/consumer/buying-digital-content-and-
services/problem-with-digital-content-or-service/) . The new rules only apply
to digital content and services bought after 1 November 2022.
