##  Mediation

Mediation is not marriage counselling. Its purpose is not to help a couple to
reconcile. Its purpose is to aid couples who have decided to separate to
resolve any disputes they may have in relation to the key issues such as
custody and access to children, maintenance and property rights. The mediator
is neutral and encourages the separating couple to co-operate with each other
in working out mutually acceptable arrangements that they will stick to. Any
separating couple can avail of mediation, whether they are married or not.
This includes same-sex couples.

Mediation normally takes up to six or seven sessions but this can vary
depending on complexity. If agreement is reached, the mediator will draw up
the terms of the agreement. It is recommended that people seek independent
legal advice before signing the agreement.

Mediation is confidential and any communication with a mediator is not
admissible if agreement is not reached and there are subsequent court
proceedings.

It is advisable for couples who opt for mediation to ensure that they obtain
legal and financial advice before attending mediation so that they know their
rights and can make informed decisions.
