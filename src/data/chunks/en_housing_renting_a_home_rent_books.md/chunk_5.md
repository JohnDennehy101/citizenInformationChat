##  What if my landlord refuses to giveme a rent book?

It is against the law for your landlord to refuse to give you a rent book or a
written receipt of the rent you have paid. If this does happen you should
inform them of their obligation to give you a rent book.

If this does not resolve the situation, you should contact [ your local
authority ](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/942f74-local-authorities/) .
They are responsible for enforcing the [ Rent Book Regulations
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1993/en/si/0146.html) .

[ Threshold ](https://threshold.ie/faq/setting-up-a-tenancy/) can also advise
you on this and help you contact your local authority.

[ The Residential Tenancies Board (RTB) ](https://www.rtb.ie/dispute-
resolution-services) also offers a dispute resolution service for landlords
and tenants. Landlords must be registered with the RTB to use the service but
tenants can use it even if their landlord has not registered the tenancy.
