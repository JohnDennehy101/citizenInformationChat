###  **Creation of Small Native Forests on farmed land â€“ NTA1**

This option is for people planting native forestry on previously farmed land.

The purpose of this option is to help contribute to Ireland's targets on a
wide range of environmental priorities, mainly climate change and
biodiversity.

You must plant an area of between 0.1 and 1 hectare. The area can be broken up
into smaller areas so long as they are not less than 0.1 hectare. For example,
you could plant the corners of fields.

The areas must be at least 20 metres in width, measured tree-to-tree. In
certain situations, 10% of a proposed area can be less than 20 metres in
width, but it cannot be less than 10 metres wide.
