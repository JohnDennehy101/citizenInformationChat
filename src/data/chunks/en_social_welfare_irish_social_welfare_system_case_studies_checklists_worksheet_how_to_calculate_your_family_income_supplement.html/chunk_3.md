###  This worksheet will help you to work out the amount of Working Family
Payment you may get (2024).

[ Working Family Payment (WFP) ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-
welfare/social-welfare-payments/families-and-children/working-family-payment/)
is a weekly tax-free payment for employees with children.

To qualify for WFP, your average total weekly family income must be below a
certain amount for your family size. WFP pays 60% of the difference between
your total family income and the income limit which applies to your family.

To find out your weekly rate of WFP, firstly calculate your total family
income. Secondly, take away your total family income from the maximum income
limit set for your family size (see table below).

The WFP rate you get is 60% of the difference between your total family income
and the income limit which applies to your family, rounded up to the nearest
euro.
