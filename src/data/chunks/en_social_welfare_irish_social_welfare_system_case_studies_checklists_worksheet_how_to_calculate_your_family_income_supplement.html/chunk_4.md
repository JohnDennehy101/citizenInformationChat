####  **Benefit of Work Estimator**

You can also use a [ benefit of work estimator
](https://www.mywelfare.ie/benefitofworkjsestimator) from the Department of
Social Protection to help you assess out the financial consequences of taking
up full-time work.

The estimator works out the total amount you would get if you take up full-
time work (including any Working Family Payment) and compares this to what you
are getting in jobseeker payments (including [ Rent Supplement
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/social-welfare-
payments/supplementary-welfare-schemes/rent-supplement/) ).
