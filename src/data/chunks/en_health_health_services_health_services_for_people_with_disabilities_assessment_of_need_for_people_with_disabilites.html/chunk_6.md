###  What happens after I send in the application?

After you send in your application, you will get a letter from the HSE
confirming they have received your application and the date when the
assessment will start. The HSE must send you this letter within 14 days of
your application.

Once the HSE receives your application in writing, they must start the
assessment within 3 months and must finish the assessment within a further 3
months. An Assessment of Need starts when the Assessment Officer arranges the
referral to the assessors, if needed.

In exceptional circumstances, the assessment may take longer than 3 months. If
there is a delay in completing the assessment, you must be told the reason and
given a timescale for when it will be completed.
