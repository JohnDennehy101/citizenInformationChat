###  What does the Assessment Officer do?

The Assessment Officer arranges for assessments to be carried out.

They will first carry out an initial review of your application. They will
then contact you for more information that will help to show the nature and
difficulty of your childâ€™s disability.

The Assessment Officer must then decide if an applicant is eligible for an
Assessment of Need within the terms of the Disability Act.

If your child is eligible for an Assessment of Need, they will refer your
child to HSE employees or other experienced professionals, known as assessors,
to carry out the assessment.
