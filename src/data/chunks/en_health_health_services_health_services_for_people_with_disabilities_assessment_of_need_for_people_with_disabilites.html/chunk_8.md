###  What do the assessors do?

The assessors decide what health needs arise from your child's disability and
what services are needed to meet those needs. The assessors do not give a
diagnosis.

The assessment must be carried out in accordance with the [ standards for the
Assessment of Need (pdf)
](https://www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/4/disability/disability-
assessment/standards-for-need-assessment.pdf) . Parents and legal guardians
will be encouraged to take part in their child’s assessment.

When the Assessment of Need is complete, the Assessment Officer writes an
assessment report.

If your child is deemed to have a disability, the assessment report will be
given to a Liaison Officer. The Liaison Officer will use the report to draw up
a Service Statement (See ‘What is a Service Statement’ below)

If your child is not deemed to have a disability, you will still get an
assessment report. You will not get a Service Statement.
