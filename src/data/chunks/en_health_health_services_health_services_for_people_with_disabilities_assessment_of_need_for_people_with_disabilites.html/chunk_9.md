##  What is an assessment report?

The assessment report provides you with information on the health needs of
your child. The report also lists the services your child needs.

If the report states your child has a disability, the following is included:

  * A statement of the nature and extent of the disability 
  * A statement of the health and education needs arising from the disability 
  * A statement of the appropriate services to meet those needs 
  * A statement of the period within which a review of the assessment should be carried out (this must be no later than a year from the date the assessment report is issued)
