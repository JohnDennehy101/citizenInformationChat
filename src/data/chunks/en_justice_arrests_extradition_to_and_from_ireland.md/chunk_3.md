##  Extradition from Ireland to non-EU Countries

You may be extradited from Ireland to countries if Ireland has extradition
agreements where certain conditions are met including:

  * **Dual criminality:** You are charged with an offence that is punishable by imprisonment in Ireland and also in the other country for at least a year. Or, you are convicted of such an offence, and a sentence of at least four months has been imposed. So, the offence must be the same in the two countries. You may not be extradited if you are going to be held in custody for the purpose of investigation. 
  * **Not a political offence** or one connected with a political offence. The definition of political offence was initially quite wide but has now been narrowed considerably. In general, it does not include terrorist type offences. 
  * The death penalty does not apply to the offence.
