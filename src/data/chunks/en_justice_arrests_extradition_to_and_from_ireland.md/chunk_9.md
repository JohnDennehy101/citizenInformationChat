###  **Who manages the European Arrest Warrant in Ireland?**

In Ireland, the Department of Justice manages the European Arrest Warrant
process as the nominated central authority.

The Director of Public Prosecutions may apply to the High Court for a European
Arrest Warrant when somebody is in another member state and faces charges or
must serve a sentence in Ireland.
