###  Process of extradition

The other country that is looking for your extradition from Ireland must apply
for your extradition to the Minister for Justice. All extradition proceedings
are then dealt with by the [ High Court ](/en/justice/courts-system/high-
court/) . The usual rules in relation to criminal trials apply to extradition
proceedings.

If you are an Irish national, you cannot be extradited unless the specific
extradition treaty or arrangement says otherwise. For example, treaties with
the United States and with Australia apply to Irish citizens or nationals.

[ Further information on extradition from Ireland to non-EU countries
](https://www.gov.ie/en/policy-information/282ce-extradition/) is available on
the Department of Justiceâ€™s website.
