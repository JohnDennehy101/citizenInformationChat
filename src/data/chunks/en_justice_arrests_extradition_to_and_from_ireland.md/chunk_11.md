###  **Political offences and extradition**

The [ Extradition (European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism) Act
1987 ](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1987/en/act/pub/0001/index.html) is
based on the [ European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism
](http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Treaties/Html/090.htm) . This
legislation restricts the circumstances in which a person can avoid
extradition on the grounds that the offence in question is a political offence
or an offence connected with a political offence.

The underlying principle of the terrorism convention was that perpetrators of
acts of terrorism should not be immune from extradition, by pleading that the
act they had committed was a political offence.

The [ Extradition (Amendment) Act 1994
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1994/en/act/pub/0006/index.html) extended the
range of offences that could not be regarded as political for extradition
purposes.
