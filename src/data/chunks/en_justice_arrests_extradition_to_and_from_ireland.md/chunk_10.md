##  Irish Legislation on extradition

[ Part II of the Extradition Act 1965
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1965/en/act/pub/0017/sec0008.html#zza17y1965s8)
provides for extradition between Ireland and countries other than the UK. This
legislation is modelled on the [ 1957 Council of Europe Convention on
Extradition ](http://conventions.coe.int/treaty/en/Treaties/Html/024.htm) to
which Ireland is a party.

Ireland is also a party to a number of international conventions which provide
special extradition arrangements in relation to specific offences - for
example, in the aviation field. The 1965 Act has been amended on a number of
occasions. In fact, Part III of the 1965 Act dealing with extradition between
Ireland and the UK was repealed by the European Arrest Warrant Act 2003.

The [ Extradition (European Union Conventions) Act 2001
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2001/en/act/pub/0049/index.html) provided for
the implementation of the [ 1995 and 1996 Conventions on Simplified
Extradition Procedure
](http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/justice_freedom_security/judicial_cooperation_in_criminal_matters/l14015a_en.htm)
between the member states of the European Union. The Act also provides that
all extradition proceedings are to be heard in the High Court.
