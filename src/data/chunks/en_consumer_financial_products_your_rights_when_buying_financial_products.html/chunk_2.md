##  What is a financial product?

When you open a bank account, take out a loan or sign up to other financial
services, you are making a contract with the financial services company.

Just like other consumer contracts, there are certain parts of the contract
that the company can set. However, [ these terms and conditions
](/en/consumer/consumer-laws/terms-and-conditions/) must not go against your
consumer rights and they must not be unfair.

Financial services companies must deal with you in a fair, clear, and
professional way.

The [ Central Bank of Ireland (Central Bank)
](https://www.centralbank.ie/home) regulates financial services providers in
Ireland.
