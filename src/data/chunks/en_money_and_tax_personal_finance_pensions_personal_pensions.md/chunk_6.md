###  Approved Retirement Funds

An Approved Retirement Fund (ARF) is a personal retirement fund where you can
keep your pension fund invested as a lump sum after retirement. You can
withdraw money from it regularly to give yourself an income. Any money that
remains in the fund after your death can be left to your next of kin. Because
an ARF invests in various assets (such as shares, property, bonds and cash),
your original investment is not guaranteed. This means there is a risk that
your fund could reduce over time.

Before 1 January 2022, if you had a guaranteed annual pension income of less
than â‚¬12,700, you had to purchase an Approved Minimum Retirement Fund (AMRF)
which had extra restrictions on withdrawing funds. Since 1 January 2022, this
requirement no longer applies and any existing AMRF automatically became an
ARF.
