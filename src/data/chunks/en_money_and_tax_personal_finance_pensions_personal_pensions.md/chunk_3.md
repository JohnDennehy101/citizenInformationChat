##  Getting a personal pension

**Retirement Annuity Contract (RAC)** is the formal name for what is commonly
called a personal pension plan and is a type of insurance contract. Various
plans are available and you can buy directly from providers or an independent
financial adviser can help you find the best option. If you are comparing
plans, check what fees will be charged and when. Also check how your
contributions will be invested and what risk there is for that type of
investment.

A **Personal Retirement Savings Account (PRSA)** is another type of personal
pension. It is like an investment account that you use to save for your
retirement. [ Read more about getting a PRSA ](/en/money-and-tax/personal-
