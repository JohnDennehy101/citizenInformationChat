##  Introduction

If you are self-employed or you have an employer who does not have an [
occupational pension ](/en/money-and-tax/personal-
finance/pensions/occupational-pensions/) scheme, you may need to arrange your
own pension, called a personal pension or private pension. Personal pensions
are managed by a life assurance or investment company.

Most personal pensions policies are insurance policies. Unlike most insurance
policies, you can get [ tax relief on pension contributions ](/en/money-and-
tax/personal-finance/pensions/tax-relief-on-pensions/) .

If you have a personal pension, you do not have to always remain in the same
pension fund. You can transfer funds accumulated with one insurer to another
fund with another insurer. There may be costs involved in doing this.
