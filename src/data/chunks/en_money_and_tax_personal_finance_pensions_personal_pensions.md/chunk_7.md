##  What happens to your pension fund after your death

If you die before retirement and have a personal pension, the accumulated
funds form part of [ your estate and its distribution ](/en/death/the-
deceaseds-estate/what-happens-the-deceaseds-estate/) . [ Capital Acquisitions
Tax (CAT) ](/en/money-and-tax/tax/capital-taxes/) may apply.

Your annuity income is usually just for your own lifetime and generally does
not go to your dependants when you die. However, there are some guaranteed
annuity products that may pay out benefits to your dependants

If you die after retirement and have invested in an ARF, the remaining funds
form part of your estate but are treated as your income in the year of death.

The tax treatment of ARFs when you die depends on who inherits the ARF.
