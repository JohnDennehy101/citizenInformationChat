##  Introduction

The [ Garda Síochána ](http://www.garda.ie/) (also commonly referred to as the
Gardaí) is the national police force in the Republic of Ireland. The name
Garda Síochána in English means 'guardians of the peace'.

The Garda Síochána has responsibility for carrying out all policing duties in
the Irish State. It also provides State security services and carries out
criminal and traffic law enforcement.

The Gardaí have many powers including the [ powers to arrest you
](/en/justice/arrests/arrests/) in some cases if they suspect you of
committing a criminal offence. They also have the [ power to search you or
your property ](/en/justice/arrests/powers-of-search/) in some cases.
Uniformed Gardaí do not routinely carry firearms.

The Minister for Justice must account to the [ Oireachtas
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/government_in_ireland/houses_of_the_oireachtas/)
(Irish parliament) for the performance of the Garda Síochána. The main
functions of the Gardaí and its organisational structure are currently set out
in the [ Garda Síochána Act 2005
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2005/en/act/pub/0020/index.html) . This
legislation will be replaced by the [ Policing, Security and Community Safety
Act 2024 ](https://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2024/act/1/enacted/en/html) .
