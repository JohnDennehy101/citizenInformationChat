###  Are there any offences relating to behaviour warnings?

When a Garda decides to issue a behaviour warning to a child, the Garda may
need the child to give their name and address for the purpose of the behaviour
warning or the written record of it.

If the child fails to give a name and address or gives a name and address that
is false or misleading, then the child is committing an offence and can be
charged and convicted in the Children Court to a [ class E fine
](/en/justice/criminal-law/criminal-trial/fines-for-criminal-offences/) .
