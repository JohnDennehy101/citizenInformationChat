##  Introduction

The Garda Síochána have the power to deal with anti-social behaviour in a
number of ways. They can:

  * Issue anti-social behaviour warnings to children 
  * Convene meetings to discuss a child’s anti-social behaviour 
  * Request a child and their parents or guardian to enter into a good behaviour contract and 
  * Apply to the courts for an anti-social behaviour order in respect of a child (commonly known as an ASBO) 

Provisions for dealing with anti-social behaviour by children aged between 12
and 18 years were introduced by Part 13 of the [ Criminal Justice Act 2006
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2006/en/act/pub/0026/index.html)

The intention of these laws is to allow the Gardaí to deal effectively with
anti-social behaviour.
