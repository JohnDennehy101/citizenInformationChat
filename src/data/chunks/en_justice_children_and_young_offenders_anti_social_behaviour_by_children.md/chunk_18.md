A good behaviour contract sets down in writing the undertakings or promises
given by the child and parents or guardian at the meeting. It is signed by
both the child and the parents or guardian.

The good behaviour contract remains in force for a maximum period of 6 months
from the date of the meeting, but it may be extended for a further 3 months at
the request of the child and the parents or guardian.
