###  Behaviour meeting with Gardaí

After giving a behaviour warning to a child, the Garda can make a report to
the garda superintendent in charge of the district, outlining the concerns
about the child’s behaviour.

The garda superintendent organises a meeting to discuss that child’s behaviour
if:

  * The superintendent is satisfied that the child has behaved in an anti-social manner and is likely to continue doing so, and 
  * The child has previously behaved in an anti-social manner but: 
    * The child has not received a warning in respect of previous anti-social behaviour, or 
    * Holding a meeting would hope to prevent further such behaviour by the child
