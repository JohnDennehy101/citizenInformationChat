###  How long does a behaviour order last?

A behaviour order issued by the Children Court stays in place for a maximum of
2 years from the date of the order.

The court has the authority, however, to change or end the order if an
application to do so is made by the child concerned, their parents or
guardian, or by a member of the Garda Síochána not below the rank of
superintendent.
