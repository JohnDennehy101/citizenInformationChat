###  What happens if a child breaks the agreement in the good behaviour
contract?

If a child behaves in breach of the agreement made in the contract, the garda
superintendent may organise another meeting to renew the contract if the child
and parents or guardian agree to do so.

If, however, the superintendent does not believe that another meeting would
help to prevent anti-social behaviour by the child concerned, the
superintendent may either:

  * Recommend that the child be admitted to the Juvenile Diversion Programme, or 
  * If satisfied that the childâ€™s participation in the Juvenile Diversion Programme would not be appropriate, apply to the [ Children Court ](/en/justice/courts-system/children-court/) for a behaviour order in respect of the child. 

The superintendent can also recommend admitting the child to the diversion
programme or applying for a behaviour order:

  * If the child or the parents or guardian refuse at the first meeting to sign a good behaviour contract, or 
  * If the superintendent decides at the start that calling a meeting would not help to prevent anti-social behaviour by the child.
