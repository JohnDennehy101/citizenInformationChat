##  How an overdraft works

Before you use an overdraft, you should apply to your bank or credit union to
make an overdraft available. This is called having an overdraft facility.

There will be a limit to the amount of the overdraft. How much of an overdraft
you get usually depends on how well you have managed your account in the past.
For example, the bank or credit union will check whether you pay your bills
regularly and pay off your credit card debt every month. If you have a bad [
credit history ](/en/money-and-tax/personal-finance/loans-and-credit/your-
credit-history/) , you may find it difficult to get an overdraft.

The bank or credit union will set a time limit for the overdraft to be fully
repaid. The overdraft is paid back to the bank when money is put into your
account. If you do not repay the overdraft in the agreed time, it can affect
your credit history and make it harder to get loans or overdrafts in future.
