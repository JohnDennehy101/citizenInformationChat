###  New funds

The **Future Ireland Fund** will have 0.8% of GDP paid annually to the fund
from 2024 to 2035 (approximately €4.3 billion in 2024). The fund is estimated
to reach around €100 billion by 2035. It will be used to meet the costs of
ageing, climate, digitalisation and other fiscal and economic challenges.

The **Infrastructure, Climate and Nature Fund** will grow by 2 billion a year
from 2024 to 2030. The €14 billion fund will allow for investment in
infrastructure and resources for capital investment in the event of economic
downturns. It will also support climate and nature-related projects (€3
billion).

The funds will both be managed by the National Treasury Management Agency
(NTMA) and will require legislation.
