###  **Rent Tax Credit**

The [ Rent Tax Credit ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/money-and-
tax/tax/housing-taxes-and-reliefs/rent-tax-credit/) for people paying for
private rented accommodation will be increased from €500 to €750 a year from
2024.

The Rent Tax Credit will be extended to parents who pay for rented
accommodation for their student children under the [ Rent-a-room scheme
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/housing/owning-a-home/home-
owners/renting-a-room-in-your-home/) and for ‘digs’. This change will be
backdated to include the 2022 and 2023 tax years.
