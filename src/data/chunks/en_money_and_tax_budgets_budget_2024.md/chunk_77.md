###  **Carbon tax**

Carbon tax will increase by the same amount in every budget until 2029. The
increase will be applied to auto fuels (petrol and auto diesel) from midnight
on Budget night (from 11 October 2023). So, the rate per tonne of carbon
dioxide emitted for petrol and diesel will go up by €7.50 from €48.50 to
€56.00 from 11 October 2023. The increase will be applied to all other fuels
from 1 May 2024.
