###  **Student contribution**

The Student Contribution will be reduced by €1,000 in the 2023/2024 academic
year for students who qualify for the Free Fees Scheme. If you have already
paid your Student Contribution, you will still benefit from the reduction and
you will get any refund due to you.

From September 2024, the income threshold to qualify for the 100% Student
Contribution will increase to €55,924.
