####  If your pay from work is reduced

You may get an increase in your One-Parent Family Payment (OFP) if your wages
are reduced. Send a current payslip (showing your reduced pay) with a letter
from your employer, confirming your new work hours and pay, to the Intreo
Centre or Social Welfare Branch Office dealing with your OFP.

If you are also getting the Working Family Payment (WFP), your WFP rate will
stay the same. However, if the number of hours you work is reduced to below 19
hours a week (38 hours a fortnight), you are no longer entitled to WFP.

If you are on the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP), you should contact your
local authority to find out if you can get a reduction in your weekly HAP rent
contribution. If you rent from a local authority or housing association you
should contact them to find out if you can get a reduction in your rent.

If you are not getting a [ medical card ](/en/health/medical-cards-and-gp-
visit-cards/medical-card/) or [ GP visit card ](/en/health/medical-cards-and-
gp-visit-cards/gp-visit-cards/) , you should find out if you now qualify.
