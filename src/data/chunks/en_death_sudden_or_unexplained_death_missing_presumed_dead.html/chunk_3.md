##  Dealing with the missing person's property

The [ Civil Law (Presumption of Death) Act 2019
](https://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2019/act/23/enacted/en/print) allows a
court to make a "presumption of death order" if it is satisfied that the
person's death is either virtually certain, or highly probable. You no longer
have to wait 7 years.

If such an order is made and not successfully appealed, it has the same status
as a death certificate.
