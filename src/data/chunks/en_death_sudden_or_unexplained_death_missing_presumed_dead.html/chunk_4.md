###  When to apply for an order

There is no minimum waiting period before an application can be made if the
applicant can provide enough evidence to satisfy the court that the person is
virtually certain to have died.

However, if the applicant can only produce evidence to satisfy the court that
it is highly probable that the missing person is dead, then they must wait one
year.
