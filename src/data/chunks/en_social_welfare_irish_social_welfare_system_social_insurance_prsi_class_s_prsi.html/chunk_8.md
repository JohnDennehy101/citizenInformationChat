##  Registering for PRSI

When you take up self-employment, you should tell Revenue that you are now
self-employed and you wish to register for self-assessment. You can register
with Revenue as [ a self-employed sole trader online
](https://www.revenue.ie/en/starting-a-business/registering-for-tax/how-to-
register-for-tax-as-a-sole-trader.aspx) .

Certain people can only register using the paper form: [ Form TR1 - Tax
Registration form for Sole Traders, Trusts and Partnerships (pdf)
](https://www.revenue.ie/en/self-assessment-and-self-
employment/documents/form-tr1.pdf) .

When you register for self-assessment with Revenue, you will automatically be
registered for PRSI purposes with the Department of Social Protection.

You can also [ register as an employer for PAYE
](https://www.revenue.ie/en/employing-people/becoming-an-employer-and-ongoing-
obligations/registration-of-employers-for-paye-purposes/index.aspx) using
Revenueâ€™s online service, if you need to do so at this stage.
