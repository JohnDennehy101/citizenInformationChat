##  FLAC phone advice appointments

FLAC also provide a small number of free legal advice phone appointments with
volunteer lawyers.

These appointments are limited and not available by request. You can be
referred for a FLAC phone advice appointment by a [ Citizens Information
Centre (CIC) ](https://centres.citizensinformation.ie/) or another FLAC
partner.

An information officer in the CIC or another FLAC partner organisation will
discuss your query with you before referral.

The appointment is a free, confidential 15-20 minute phone call that can
provide:

  * First stop assistance 
  * Basic legal information 
  * Advice, such as the next steps you need to take 
  * A referral to another appropriate service 

You cannot get a FLAC phone advice appointment if you:

  * Need ongoing legal advice and/or representation 
  * Have complex legal queries 
  * Already have a lawyer acting on your behalf 
  * Are looking for a second opinion on legal advice you already received 
  * Can afford to pay for legal advice or get legal advice from your union 
  * Are an employer 

Face-to-face FLAC advice clinics are no longer available in Citizens
Information Centres.

You can learn more about these appointments on the [ FLAC website
