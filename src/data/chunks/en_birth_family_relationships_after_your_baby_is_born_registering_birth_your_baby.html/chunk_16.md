##  Re-registration of a birth to include other legal parent

You can re-register a birth if your child was conceived before 4 May 2020 as a
result of a donor-assisted human reproduction (DAHR) procedure and the mother
is recorded as the only legal parent in the Register of Births. See ‘Parents
of a donor-conceived child’ above.
