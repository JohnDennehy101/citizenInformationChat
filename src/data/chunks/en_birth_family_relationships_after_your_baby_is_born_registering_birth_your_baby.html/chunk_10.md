####  **Baby conceived after 4 May 2020**

If the baby is conceived **after** 4 May 2020 (in a DAHR facility in Ireland
using a traceable sperm donor), the DAHR facility will give the parents a
certificate. The certificate will contain various details in relation to the
DAHR procedure and a record of the consent of the parent(s) to the parentage
of the child. This certificate will need to be submitted with an application
form to the General Register Office.
