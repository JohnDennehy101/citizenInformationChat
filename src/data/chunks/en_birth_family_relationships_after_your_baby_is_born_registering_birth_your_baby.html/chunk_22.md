###  Gender Recognition Certificates

You can apply for a [ Gender Recognition Certificate
](https://www.gov.ie/en/service/b55abf-gender-recognition-certificate/) in
order to have your preferred gender recognised by the State. This is set out
in the [ Gender Recognition Act 2015
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2015/act/25/enacted/en/html) . The Act
also provides for you to apply for a certified copy of an entry in the
Register of Gender Recognition. A certificate issued from the Register of
Gender Recognition is the same as a birth certificate and satisfies all
requirements where you are asked to provide a birth certificate.
