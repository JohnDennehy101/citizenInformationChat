##  Who can register a birth?

The parent(s) of the child usually register the birth. This is because they
are the main _qualified informants_ . For a list of other qualified
informants, see ‘If the parents cannot register the birth’ below.

From 12 August 2024, [ some parents can register the birth of their baby
online ](https://civilregistration.mywelfare.ie/WhoCanRegister) on [
MyWelfare.ie ](https://services.mywelfare.ie/) using their [ verified MyGovID
account ](/en/government-in-ireland/how-government-works/egovernment/mygovid/)
(see ‘How to register a birth’ above).

If you are attending a Civil Registration Service in person, you must bring
photo identification, for example, a passport or driving licence, and your PPS
Number to the appointment to register the birth. In some cases, you may need
to provide additional information, for example, if a mother has been married
previously. Contact the [ Civil Registration Service
](https://www2.hse.ie/services/births-deaths-and-marriages/find-a-civil-
registration-service/) to find out more.
