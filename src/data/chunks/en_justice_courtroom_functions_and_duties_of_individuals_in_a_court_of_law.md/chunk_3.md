##  The judge

The judge in an Irish courtroom usually sits on a raised platform at the top
of the court and wears a white collar and a black gown.

The judge is in charge of the courtroom and they must make sure that the trial
is fair. They settle any legal argument and direct the jury.

If there is no [ jury
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/justice/courtroom/jury/) in a case, it
is the judge who decides which party wins and which party loses. They listen
to the evidence of both sides and to the submissions of the [ barristers
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/justice/courtroom/barristers/) (or [
solicitors
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/justice/courtroom/solicitors/) ). The
judge may ask questions of any [ witness
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/justice/witnesses/) and of the
barristers (or solicitors).

If there is a jury, they usually decide the outcome of the case. The jury in a
[ criminal trial ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/justice/criminal-
law/criminal-trial/criminal-trial/) has the responsibility of deciding whether
the person accused of the crime is guilty or not guilty. If the defendant is
found guilty the judge decides the sentence.
