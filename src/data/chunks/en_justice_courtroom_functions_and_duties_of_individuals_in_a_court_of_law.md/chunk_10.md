##  Public and press

Most courtrooms are open to the public and anyone can come in and watch.

If the courtroom is not open to the public there will be a sign on the door
reading ‘ _in camera_ ’. This means that the case is heard in private and only
people who are involved in the case are allowed in. This is done to protect
the privacy of the people in court, usually in family law matters and some
criminal cases (for instance rape cases or cases in the juvenile courts).

The members of the public attending a court case may include reporters
employed by newspapers, radio, television, or legal reports companies.

Everything that is said in court is recorded digitally by a Digital Audio
Recording (DAR) box.
