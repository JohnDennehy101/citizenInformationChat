##  The jury

The jury consists of 12 members of the public who sit in a box to one side of
the judge. One of the jurors is selected as a foreman of the jury by the
members of the jury before the case starts. They act as an informal
chairperson and spokesperson for the jury.

You are entitled to be tried by jury unless the alleged offence is a minor one
or one that is being tried in the [ Special Criminal Court
](/en/justice/courts-system/special-criminal-court/) . However, a jury is not
required in every legal case. There is a jury in some civil cases such as
defamation and assault cases. However, for the majority of civil cases such as
personal injuries actions and family law cases, there is no jury - it is the [
judge ](/en/justice/courtroom/judge/) who decides the outcome.

The jurors are charged with the responsibility of deciding whether, on the
facts of the case, a person is guilty or not guilty of the offence for which
they have been charged.

The jury must reach its verdict by considering only the [ evidence
](/en/justice/evidence/evidence-introduction/) introduced in court and the
directions of the judge. The jury does not interpret the law. It follows the
directions of the judge as regards legal matters.

The jury has no role in [ sentencing ](/en/justice/criminal-law/criminal-
trial/sentence/) . This decision is left up to the judge following submissions
made by both sides.
