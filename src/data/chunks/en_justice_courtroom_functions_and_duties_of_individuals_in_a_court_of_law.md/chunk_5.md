##  Solicitors

A solicitor is a type of lawyer. A solicitor may give you legal advice about
taking or defending a case. If you are involved in a court case, your
solicitor will manage the case and represent you when dealing with the other
party. For example, your solicitor will send letters to the other side on your
behalf. Your solicitor will file all of the necessary court documents and
contact the [ witnesses ](/en/justice/witnesses/being-a-witness/) for the
case.

Solicitors do not have to wear any special clothes when in court. If there is
a barrister involved in the case, the solicitor will usually sit facing the
barrister in the bench under the [ judge ](/en/justice/courtroom/judge/) . If
the barrister needs a matter to be clarified, they can then lean over to ask
the solicitor.

If it is necessary to involve a [ barrister
](/en/justice/courtroom/barristers/) in the case, your solicitor will brief
the barrister by sending them all of the necessary documents and information.

Your solicitor may also actually represent you in court, although in the [
High Court ](/en/justice/courts-system/high-court/) and the [ Supreme Court
](/en/justice/courts-system/supreme-court/) , a barrister will usually be
engaged.
