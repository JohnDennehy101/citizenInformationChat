##  What to expect when you go to court

If you are going to court, you are not expected to know all the formalities of
the courtroom and some of these will be explained to you during the case. For
example, the judge or clerk will tell you where to sit when you arrive, and
you will be told when you can leave.

Some of the procedures in a courtroom include:

  * Standing when the judge is entering or leaving the court, or when you are speaking to the court 
  * Addressing the judge as ‘judge’ when you are speaking to them 
  * Turning off your phone or switching it to silent mode, and not taking pictures or recording videos during the case 
  * Not raising your voice or interrupting others, and only speaking when directed to do so 

You are allowed to take notes during the case if you wish, and you can ask the
judge for a break if you need one.
