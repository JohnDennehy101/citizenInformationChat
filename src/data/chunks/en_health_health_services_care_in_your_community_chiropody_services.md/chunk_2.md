##  What is chiropody and podiatry?

If you have problems with your feet or lower limbs, a chiropodist is a health
professional that can examine, diagnose and treat any diseases or
abnormalities your feet may have.

Chiropodists can also help alleviate painful symptoms and improve mobility.

Chiropodists are also often known as podiatrists.

If you need chiropody services, you may be referred to a chiropodist by your
GP or local [ public health nurse
