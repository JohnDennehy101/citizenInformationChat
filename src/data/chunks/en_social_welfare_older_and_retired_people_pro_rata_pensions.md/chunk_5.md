##  Rules to get a pro-rata pension

If you reach pension age on or after 6 April 2012 and you have a mixed
insurance record, you can get a pro-rata pension if you meet the following
conditions:

  * You have a minimum of 520 PRSI contributions (full-rate and modified-rate) 
  * You have at least 260 full-rate paid contributions since your entry into insurance 
  * Adding together a mixture of full-rate contributions and modified-rate contributions, gives you a yearly average of at least 10 from the time you first entered insurance (or 1953, whichever is later) to the end of the tax year before you reach 66. This yearly average condition does not apply if the TCA (or Aggregated Contributions Method) is used 
  * You do not qualify for a pension under EU regulations or under reciprocal arrangements with other countries (or you only qualify for a pension at a lower rate than this pro-rata pension would give you). 

If you meet all these conditions, you may qualify for a pension proportionate
to the number of contributions you paid at the full rate. For example, if you
worked for 40 years and 10 of those years were in the private sector, you
would get one-quarter of the full pension.
