###  Exceptions to pro-rata pensions

If you had a career in both the public and private sectors, you may not have a
mixed insurance record. This is because people with incomes above certain
amounts didn’t have to pay PRSI before 1 April 1974. Also, some groups (for
example, Gardaí) who now pay PRSI were previously outside the system.
