###  **Pro-rata pensions for people with pre-1953 contributions**

There is a special pro-rata pension for people with pre-1953 contributions.
This pro-rata pension was introduced in May 2000. You may qualify if you have
at least 520 full contributions, some of which must have been paid before
1953. Every 2 contributions paid before 1953 count as 3.

If you meet these conditions, you may get a pro-rata pension of half the
normal maximum rate. You can also get increases for a qualified adult and
child at half-rate.

The increase for pensioners over 80 is paid in full.
