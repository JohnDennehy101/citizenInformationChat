###  **Pro-rata pension for intermittent insurance**

Since January 2013, you can no longer apply to the Pro-rata pension for
intermittent insurance pension.

Pro-rata pensions were first arranged for people who had been in and out of
insurance, because of the operation of the income limit on contributions.

Before 1974, non-manual workers only had to pay social insurance contributions
if their income was below a certain level. From 1 April 1974, there has been
no income limit.

Many people paid social insurance for a period and then stopped paying when
their income went above the limit. They then came back into the insurance
system when the income limit was abolished in April 1974.

They would not meet the usual average requirement because they stopped paying
for a while. On 14 October 1988, arrangements were made for them to qualify
for a pro-rata pension.
