##  Pro-rata pension for mixed insurance

Pro-rata pensions were introduced because some people were excluded from the
social insurance system at particular times.

You may get a pro-rata pension if you have a mixed insurance record. This can
happen when you spend:

  * Part of your working life in the public service (where you pay modified-rate social insurance contributions), and 
  * Part of your working life in the private sector (where you pay full-rate social insurance contributions).
