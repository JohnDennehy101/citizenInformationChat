##  How your income is assessed for Supplementary Welfare Allowance

SWA is a means-tested payment.

In a means test the Department of Social Protection examines all your sources
of income. To get SWA, your income must be below a certain amount.

If you are married, in a civil partnership or cohabiting, the total income of
the couple is added together in the means test.

The main items included in the means test are:

  * **Cash income** that you or your spouse, civil partner or cohabitant may have. For example, maintenance (except child maintenance), income from employment and income from self-employment. 
  * **Capital** , for example, the value of savings, investments, shares or any property you have (but not your own home). The first â‚¬5,000 of your capital is not taken into account.
