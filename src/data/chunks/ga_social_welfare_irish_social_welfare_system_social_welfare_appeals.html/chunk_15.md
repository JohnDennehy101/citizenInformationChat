####  **Appeal to higher authorities**

If you disagree with the final decision of the Social Welfare Appeals Office,
you can request the [ Office of the Ombudsman ](/ga/government-in-ireland/how-
government-works/standards-and-accountability/office-of-the-ombudsman/) to
examine your case.

The Ombudsman can:

  * Examine complaints about the actions of the SWAO 
  * Investigate complaints about the everyday administrative activities of the SWAO. 

You may appeal to the [ High Court ](/ga/justice/courts-system/high-court/) on
a point of law or seek a judicial review in the High Court if you think that
the appeal was not fairly conducted. You should get legal advice in this
situation.
