##  What can I appeal?

You can appeal if you are unhappy about any decision of a social welfare [
deciding officer or designated person
](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/beda50-operational-guidelines-decision-
making-and-natural-justice/?referrer=https://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/Decision-
Making-and-Natural-Justice.aspx) on a payment that is covered by the Social
Welfare Appeals Office.

You can get a [ list of social welfare schemes and benefits covered by the
Social Welfare Appeals Office (pdf)
](https://assets.gov.ie/42571/5e0eb903e82c432482943283fd667a16.pdf#page=1) .

The Social Welfare Appeals Office also deals with appeals for some payments
under the [ Supplementary Welfare Allowance Scheme ](/ga/social-
welfare/supplementary-welfare-schemes/supplementary-welfare-allow/) . However,
it does not deal with some elements of the Supplementary Welfare Allowance
Scheme such as the Additional Needs Payment, allowances in kind, or any other
once off payment.
