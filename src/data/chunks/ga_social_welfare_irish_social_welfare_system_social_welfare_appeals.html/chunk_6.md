####  **Your appeal may be redirected**

In some cases, the SWAO receives an appeal and decides that the reasons for
the decision were not fully understood by you.

In these cases, the SWAO will refer your appeal to the relevant scheme area of
the Department of Social Protection and ask for the decision to be clarified
to you. You are informed of this.

If you are still not happy with the decision following the Departmentâ€™s
clarification, you can appeal the decision to the SWAO.
