##  What is a contract of employment?

If you work for an employer for a regular wage or salary, you automatically
have a ‘contract of employment’ with them. Your contract sets out the rights
and responsibilities of you and your employer.

Legally, you do not have to get your whole contract in writing. However, the
law says you must get a ‘written statement of terms of employment’ (read more
below).

Most employees have open-ended contracts of employment. This means the
contract continues until the employer or employee ends it (for example, by [
giving notice ](/en/employment/starting-work-and-changing-job/changing-
job/giving-notice/) ). Other employees have [ fixed-term or specified-purpose
contracts ](/en/employment/employment-rights-and-conditions/contracts-of-
employment/rights-of-fixed-term-workers/) , which end on a specific date or
when a particular task is completed.

The terms of your employment contract can be:

  * ‘Express’, which means they are explained to you verbally or in writing 
  * ‘Implied’, which means they have not been specified but they still apply (for example, that all employees must do their job to the best of their ability)
