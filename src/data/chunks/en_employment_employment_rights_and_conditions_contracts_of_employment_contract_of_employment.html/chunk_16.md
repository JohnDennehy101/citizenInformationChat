###  Implied terms

‘Implied terms of employment’ are terms which are not verbally agreed to or
set out in writing, but are still legally binding.

Implied terms can come from many sources, such as:

  * Legislation and caselaw (for example, it is common law that you and your employer have a duty of care towards each other and other employees) 
  * Custom and practice within the workplace (for example, a particular rate of overtime pay for employees) 
  * An obvious consequence of what is stated in the contract (for example, that you will do your work in a competent and careful manner)
