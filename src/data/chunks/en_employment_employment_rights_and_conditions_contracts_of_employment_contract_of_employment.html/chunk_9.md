###  Specific provisions

Some employers add specific provisions into contracts of employment. For
example, they may limit your ability to work in a certain sector, or with
certain suppliers or clients of a former employer, for a certain length of
time.

If you have any concerns about this, you should get legal advice before
signing the contract. You can also get legal advice after signing it.
