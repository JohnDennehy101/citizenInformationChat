##  Further information and costs

If you wish to begin judicial review proceedings, you should contact a [
solicitor ](/en/justice/courtroom/solicitors/) who will in turn brief a
barrister to draft the papers for the case. It is also possible for you to
represent yourself if you wish to keep your legal costs down.
