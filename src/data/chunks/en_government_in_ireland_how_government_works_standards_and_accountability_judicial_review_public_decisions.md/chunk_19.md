###  Statutory schemes

Statutory judicial review schemes supplement Order 84 of the Rules of the
Superior Courts with their own specific procedural rules. These statutory
schemes narrow the availability of review through such features as:

  * Time limits for an application for leave are shorter 
  * Requirements to notify the decision-maker of the leave application 
  * Higher thresholds applied by the High Court when considering whether to allow leave, for example, substantial grounds rather than arguable case. 

Examples of statutory schemes are available in our document: [ Judicial review

law/judicial-review-in-planning-and-environmental-matters/) .
