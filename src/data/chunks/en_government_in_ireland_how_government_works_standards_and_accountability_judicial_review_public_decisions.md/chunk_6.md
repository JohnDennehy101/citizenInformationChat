###  The right to be heard and impartiality

You are entitled to fair procedures in how the decision is reached. This means
that the decision-maker must not be biased and the decision-maker must give
you a fair hearing. You must be given an adequate opportunity to present your
case. You must be informed of the matter and you must be given a chance to
comment on the material put forward by the other side.
