###  Leave stage

The first step is to make an application for leave to bring judicial review
proceedings. The leave stage is used to identify and filter out, at an early
stage, claims which may be trivial or without merit. At the leave stage you
must show that you have "sufficient interest" in the matter. In other words,
you must demonstrate that you are affected in some way by the decision you are
challenging.

The application to the court is based on a statement of grounds. This
statement should set out the reasons a judicial review is sought. It should be
accompanied by an affidavit.

If leave to proceed is granted, the applicant may then bring judicial review
proceedings. A notice of motion should be prepared and, along with the court
order granting leave to proceed with the judicial review and both the
statement of grounds and the affidavit prepared for the earlier stage, served
on all persons directly affected by the application.
