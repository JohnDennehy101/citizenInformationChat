##  Introduction

Judicial review is a way for the High Court to supervise the lower courts, [
tribunals ](/en/government-in-ireland/how-government-works/tribunals-and-
investigations/tribunals-introduction/) and other administrative bodies to
ensure that they make their decisions properly and in accordance with the law.
The [ High Court ](/en/justice/courts-system/high-court/) has the power or
_jurisdiction_ called "judicial review".

Judicial review is primarily concerned with the decision-making process rather
than with the substance of the decision. There is, however, a limited scope
for review of the substance of a decision as well.

To apply for judicial review, you must show that you were affected in some way
by the decision you are challenging. You must also show that your case has
grounds.

There are 2 types of judicial review:

  * **Conventional judicial review** : Procedure governing conventional judicial review is set out in [ Order 84 of the Rules of the Superior Courts ](http://www.courts.ie/rules.nsf/8652fb610b0b37a980256db700399507/a53b0f76ffc6c5b780256d2b0046b3dc?OpenDocument) . 
  * **Statutory judicial review** : Some legislation sets out rules about how statutory reviews of decisions made under the legislation should be governed. Statutory schemes apply to such areas as asylum, pollution control, planning and the takeover of companies.
