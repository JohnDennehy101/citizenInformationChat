##  Reports of commissions ofinvestigation

A commission makes a final report on its findings to a specified Minister. The
Minister may request interim reports on the general progress of a commission's
investigation or on a particular aspect of the investigation.

The Minister must publish the commissionâ€™s final report unless the Minister
considers that the publication might prejudice any criminal proceedings that
are in progress. In such a case, the Minister may apply to the High Court for
directions.

There are provisions for people named in the report to challenge the findings
in relation to them.

You can read the full reports of the commissions in the table above.
