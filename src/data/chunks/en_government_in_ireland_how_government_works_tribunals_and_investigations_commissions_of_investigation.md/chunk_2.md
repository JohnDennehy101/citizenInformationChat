A commission of investigation is a [ type of inquiry ](/en/government-in-
ireland/how-government-works/tribunals-and-investigations/tribunals-
introduction/) into a matter of public concern. They are less expensive and
quicker than a [ tribunal of inquiry ](/en/government-in-ireland/how-
government-works/tribunals-and-investigations/tribunals-of-inquiry/) . In
certain circumstances, a tribunal of inquiry may be set up after a commission
of investigation has reported.

Commissions of investigation can be established under the [ Commissions of
Investigation Act 2004
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2004/en/act/pub/0023/index.html) .

A commission is set up by government order – this must be approved by the Dáil
and Seanad. The terms of reference are set by the Government or by an
individual Minister. These terms must be accompanied by statements setting out
the expected time and cost of an investigation.
