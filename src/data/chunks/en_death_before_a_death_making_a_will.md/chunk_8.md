###  Residuary Clauses

A _residuary clause_ , is a section in your will that sets out what to do with
any property not specifically dealt with in the will. For example, your
residuary clause could say that anything not identified in your will should be
left to your spouse.

You may leave a part of your estate to someone, but that gift (sometimes
called a _bequest_ ) could later found to be invalid. When this happens, that
part of your estate becomes part of the _residue_ of your estate, along with
other things that are not specifically mentioned in the will.
