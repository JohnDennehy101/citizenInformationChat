##  Who can read my will after I die?

After probate has been taken out on a person's will, that will then becomes a

of these documents from the Probate Office or relevant District Probate
Registry using [ Form PAS1 (doc)

process of getting authorisation to represent you and carry out the wishes set
out in your will.

The grant sets out the name and address of the executor or administrator of
the estate and the name of the solicitor acting on their behalf (if any). It
also sets out the gross value and the net value of the estate.

public, however, certain people may be able to inspect the Inland Revenue
