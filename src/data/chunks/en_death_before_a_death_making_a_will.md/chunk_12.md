##  Changing or revoking your will

If you want to change your will, you and your witnesses must sign or initial
your will in the margin of the page beside the changes. You can also change
your will in the form of a memorandum or written note that is signed by you
and your witnesses that refers clearly to the changes.

To change your will, you can also make a separate document, called a _codicil_
, which is like an update added to the end of your will. This document, again
signed by you and your witnesses, should set out clearly and accurately the
changes you want to make to your will. These changes are then legally binding.

If you plan to make a lot of changes to your will it might be easier to simply
_revoke_ or cancel your current will by making a new one. This can only be
challenged if your mental capacity when you revoked your will is called into
question.

Your will is revoked automatically in certain situations:

  * If you marry or enter into a civil partnership, your will is revoked, unless your will was made with the marriage or civil partnership clearly in mind 
  * If you make another will, the previous will you made is revoked. 
  * If you draw up a written document that is executed in accordance with the requirements for a will, your previous will shall be revoked. 
  * If you burn, tear or destroy your will, it will no longer be considered valid. Or, if you have someone else destroy it, your will shall be revoked, provided this was done in your presence, with your consent, and with the intention of revoking your will.
