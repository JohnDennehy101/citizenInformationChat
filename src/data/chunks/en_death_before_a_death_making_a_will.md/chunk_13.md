##  What happens if I die without leaving a will?

If you die without leaving a will, then your estate will be distributed in
accordance with the law of succession.

This also happens:

  * When the will is not valid because it was not made properly 
  * When a legal challenge to the validity of the will has been successful 

The law of succession also applies to assets which are not covered by a will
where there is no residuary clause

The order in which your estate is distributed in these cases is set out in the
[ Succession Act 1965
](http://revisedacts.lawreform.ie/eli/1965/act/27/revised/en/html) .

If you are survived by:

  * A spouse or civil partner but no children (or grandchildren): your spouse or civil partner gets the entire estate. 
  * A spouse or civil partner and children: your spouse/civil partner gets two-thirds of your estate and the remaining one-third is divided equally among your children. If one of your children has died, that share goes to his/her children. 
  * Children, but no spouse or civil partner: your estate is divided equally among your children (or their children). 
  * Parents, but no spouse, civil partner or children: your estate is divided equally between your parents or given entirely to one parent if only one is living. 
  * Brothers and sisters only: your estate is shared equally among them, with the children of a deceased brother or sister taking his/her share. 
  * Nieces and nephews only: your estate is divided equally among those surviving. 
  * Other relatives only: your estate is divided equally between the nearest equal relations. 
  * No relatives: your estate goes to the State.
