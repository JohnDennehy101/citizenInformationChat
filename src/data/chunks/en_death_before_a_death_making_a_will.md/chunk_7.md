##  What should my will contain?

You do not have to have your will in any set format. However, it is important
that the will has the following:

  * Your name and address. 
  * A statement that says you revoke or disown all earlier wills or codicils. 
  * The appointment of one or more _executors_ , or people who will carry out your wishes in your will after you die, along with their names and addresses. 
  * Your will should be dated and signed by you and your witnesses. This statement is called an _attestation clause_ .
