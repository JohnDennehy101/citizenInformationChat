##  Introduction

A will is a written document that sets out what you would like to happen to
your possessions after you die. A will must be signed and witnessed.

When you die, your possessions are called your _‘estate’_ . A _‘testator’_ is
a person who writes a will. If you die without leaving a will, you die
_‘intestate’_ .
