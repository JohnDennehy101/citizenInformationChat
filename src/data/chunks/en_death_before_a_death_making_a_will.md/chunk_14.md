##  Can I give my possessions away before I die?

You can give your property away before you die, but you should consider:

  * The rules on [ Capital Acquisition Tax (CAT) ](/en/money-and-tax/tax/capital-taxes/capital-acquisitions-tax/) mean that the person you are giving your possessions to might have to pay tax. CAT may also be charged on an inheritance. 
  * If a court finds that you gave away property before you died with the intention of unfairly reducing the legal right share of a spouse, civil partner or the rights of any child, the person who received the inheritance could be made to pay it back to the estate.
