###  Disputes about wills

Most wills are not disputed, but if there is a disagreement, it must be
settled in court. The court will give effect to the testatorâ€™s wishes as
expressed in the will if possible.

The testator's wishes are taken from a reading of the will as a whole, with
words and phrases given their ordinary meaning unless they are technical words
and it can be assumed the testator meant them to be taken in their technical
meaning.

Evidence outside the will, like letters or notes that refer to the will in
advance of its making, may be introduced to the court to explain more fully
the testator's intentions and to help discover the true meaning of the will.

Because wills can be disputed, it is important that you write your will in
simple, straightforward language. Statements which could have more than one
meaning should be avoided.
