##  Getting help from MABS

As soon as you realise that you have a problem with mortgage arrears or other
debt, you can start taking action to deal with it. The [ Money Advice and
Budgeting Service ](/en/money-and-tax/personal-finance/debt/mabs-service/)
(MABS) can help you to do this, either face-to-face or over the phone on the
MABS helpline.

As part of the Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process, your mortgage lender will
ask you to document your financial situation on a [ Standard Financial
Statement (pdf) ](https://www.centralbank.ie/docs/default-
source/Regulation/consumer-protection/other-codes-of-
conduct/36-gns-4-2-7-financial-statement.pdf?sfvrsn=4) . MABS can help you to
fill out this statement.

MABS also offers information and assistance to borrowers in arrears including
a Dedicated Mortgage Arrears service and a Court Mentor service for debtors
faced with court proceedings.

In addition, MABS is involved in the [ Abhaile scheme ](/en/housing/owning-a-
home/mortgage-arrears/abhaile-mortgage-arrears-support/) for people who are in
serious mortgage arrears and at risk of losing their home. This scheme
provides a range of services to help you to deal with your situation,
including financial advice, legal advice and insolvency advice. [ Read more on
