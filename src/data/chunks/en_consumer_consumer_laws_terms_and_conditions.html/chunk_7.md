####  The black list

The ‘black list’ is a list of contract terms that are always and automatically
unfair.

The ‘black list’ includes terms that:

  * Exclude liability for death or personal injury 
  * Require you to pay for products or services that were not provided 
  * Reverse a burden of proof that is on the seller 
  * Makes you cover the cost of any arbitration 
  * Gives the seller the exclusive right to interpret a term of the contract 
  * Gives exclusive jurisdiction to the courts where the seller is based (unless you are also based there)
