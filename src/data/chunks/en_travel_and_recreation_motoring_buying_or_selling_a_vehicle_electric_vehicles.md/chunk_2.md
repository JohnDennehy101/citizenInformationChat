An electric vehicle (EV) has an electric motor that is powered by a battery
which is charged by an external source of electricity.

There are 2 main types of EVs:

  * Battery electric vehicles (BEVs) –are powered by a battery only. 
  * Hybrid electric vehicles –have an engine and electric motor – one powered by a battery and the other is fuel-powered and generally uses petrol or diesel.
