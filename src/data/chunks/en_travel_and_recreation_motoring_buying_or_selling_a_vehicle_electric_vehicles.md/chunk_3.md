##  Electric vehicle grants

You may be able to get a grant from the Sustainable Energy Authority Ireland
(SEAI) if you buy a battery-powered electric vehicle (BEV) that meets specific
standards.

Since 1 July 2023, [ you can get a grant of up to €3,500 for battery-powered
electric vehicles (BEV) ](https://www.seai.ie/grants/electric-vehicle-
grants/grant-amounts/) . (Previously, the grant was €5,000).

The grant for BEVs only applies to new cars with a full price of between
€14,000 and €60,000.

Your car dealer will apply for the grant for you, and then deduct the grant
amount from the total price of your car.

The grant of €2,500 for plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEV) has been
removed.
