###  Completing the application form

It is important when completing the application form to give all the necessary
information. This will help the Small Claims Registrar to process your claim.
If no resolution can be reached, it will also make it easier to enforce a
decree or court order, if one is granted.

The application form has 3 sections:

  1. Claimant 
  2. Respondent 
  3. Claim
