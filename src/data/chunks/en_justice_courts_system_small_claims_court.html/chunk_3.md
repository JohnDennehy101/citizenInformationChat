###  Who are the parties in a claim?

If you are making the claim, you are known as the claimant. The person you are
claiming against is known as the respondent.

Both the claimant and the respondent must be living or based in Ireland. If
either party lives or is based in another EU member state, the [ European
small claims procedure ](/en/justice/courts-system/european-small-claims-
procedure/) should be used.
