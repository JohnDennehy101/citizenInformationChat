###  What happens after I submit my claim?

At this stage, the respondent can choose to do one of the following:

  * They can admit the claim 
  * They can dispute the claim 
  * They can counterclaim 
  * They might ignore the claim 

The respondent usually has 15 calendar days to reply, but this can vary
depending on the District Court office.
