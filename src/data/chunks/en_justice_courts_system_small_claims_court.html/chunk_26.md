###  Can the courtâ€™s decision be appealed?

If either you or the respondent are unhappy with the decision of the court,
you have the right to appeal to the [ Circuit Court ](/en/justice/courts-
system/circuit-court/) . An appeal application must be made to the court
within 14 days, but you can apply to have this timeframe extended.

The respondent is likely to have legal representation and the judge can award
costs against you, so it is important to carefully consider any decision to
appeal.
