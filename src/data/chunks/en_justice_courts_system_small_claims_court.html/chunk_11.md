##  Types of claims dealt with under the procedure

The procedure can be used to resolve consumer complaints and certain other
types of disputes.

You can make consumer claims about:

  * Minor damage to your property 
  * Goods or services bought for private use from someone selling them during business 
  * The non-return of a rent deposit for certain kinds of rented properties, such as a holiday home or a flat in a premises where the landlord also lives 

The small claims procedure **cannot** be used to make consumer claims for
debts, personal injuries, or breaches of leasing or hire-purchase agreements.
