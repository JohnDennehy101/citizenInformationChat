###  Respondent does not reply to the claim

If the respondent does not reply to the claim within the specified timeframe,
they are deemed to have admitted the claim. From here, the procedure is the
same as if they had consented to judgment.

You will swear an Affidavit of Debt and the respondent is issued with a Notice
to Pay. The respondent has 28 calendar days to pay, and if they do not, you
will be given a decree for the Sheriff. The Registrar will assist you with
this process.
