##  Office of the Examiner of the High Court

The Office of the Examiner of the High Court has a role in several types of
High Court proceedings, including:

  * **Administration suits** \- when the estate of a deceased person has become the subject matter of litigation. For example, where there is a dispute as to how the estate has been administered, what assets are in the estate, who is entitled to benefit from the estate and who is a creditor of the estate. The Examiner will conduct the relevant inquiries. 
  * **Mortgage suits** \- certain proceedings where the holder of certain types of mortgage is seeking to sell the underlying property. The Examiner will coordinate the sale process once an order for sale is made by the court. 
  * **Bankruptcy matters** â€“ the Examiner processes applications for bankruptcy and acts as Registrar to the court assigned to deal with bankruptcy proceedings, known as the Bankruptcy List. The Examiner also acts as a Registrar to the court assigned to deal with matters proceeding before the Examiner, known as the Examiner's List. 

The Examiner no longer has a supervisory role in the liquidation of companies,
unless the winding up order was made prior to 1 June 2015.

The role of the Examiner of the High Court should not be confused with the
role of an examiner who may be appointed by a court to assess the prospects of
survival of a company in financial difficulty.
