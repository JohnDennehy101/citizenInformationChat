##  Disclosure in summary prosecutions

In a summary prosecution, the prosecution does not generally have to give you
all the evidence, including any witness statements, beforehand, even if you
ask for them. However, you are entitled to the evidence that you clearly need
to get a fair trial.

If you apply to the court to get disclosure of certain evidence, the court
will decide if it is in the interest of justice to give them to you.

When deciding to release evidence, the prosecution must consider similar
principles.

If you ask for particular items of evidence, you or your lawyer must explain
why you need advance disclosure of these.
