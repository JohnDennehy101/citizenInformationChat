##  Disclosure if you are prosecuted on indictment

For a trial on indictment, before your trial the prosecution must give you
certain materials which set out the evidence they intend to use in the trial
against you. These documents are usually referred to as the [ Book of Evidence
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/justice/criminal-law/criminal-
trial/disclosure-in-criminal-cases/) .

**When should you get the Book of Evidence?**

When the [ Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP)
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/justice/victims-of-crime/director-of-
public-prosecutions/) agrees to send you forward for trial, the DPP must
normally give the Book of Evidence to you (or your solicitor) **within 42
days** after you first appear in the District Court.

**Book of evidence time period extension**

The DPP can apply to the District Court to extend the 42 day period and
normally the District Court will give this extension if:

  * There is a good reason for doing so and 
  * It would be in the interest of justice to do so 

The law does not set any limit on the length of the extension. There must,
however, be a good reason for giving the extension, such as, if the [ Garda
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/justice/law-enforcement/garda-
siochana-national-police-force/) investigation is complex and there are a lot
of witnesses involved in the case.

If the District Court refuses to extend the time to provide the Book of
Evidence, the court must strike out the proceedings against you for the
offence. This does not always mean that your case is over or finished. The DPP
can bring you before the court again on the same charges.

**Giving notice of your alibi**

An alibi is evidence that you were somewhere else when the criminal offence
took place.

If you plan to rely on the evidence of any alibi at your trial, you must give
notice of the alibi to the prosecution **within 14 days** of being served the
Book of Evidence.
