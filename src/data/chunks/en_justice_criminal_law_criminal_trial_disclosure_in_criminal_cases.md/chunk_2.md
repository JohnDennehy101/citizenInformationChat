##  Introduction

You can read about the process of a criminal trial on our website.

In a criminal trial the prosecution (the side accusing you) must disclose to
you all relevant evidence that it has before the trial starts. The prosecution
must share both:

  * The evidence the prosecution intends to use at your trial, and 
  * The evidence it has but does not intend to use if that evidence could help your defence. 

However, the duty to disclose is different for:

  * [ Summary prosecutions ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/justice/criminal-law/criminal-offences/classification-of-crimes-in-criminal-cases/) tried in the [ District Court ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/justice/courts-system/district-court/) before a judge without a jury, and 
  * Prosecutions on indictment, tried before a judge and jury in the [ Circuit Court ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/justice/courts-system/circuit-court/) or the [ Central Criminal Court ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/justice/courts-system/high-court/) .
