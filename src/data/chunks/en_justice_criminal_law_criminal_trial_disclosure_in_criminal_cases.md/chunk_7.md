###  Who creates the Book of Evidence?

While the Book of Evidence is gathered and served on behalf of the DPP, it is
normally the investigating Garda who puts the Book of Evidence together. Work
on the Book of Evidence starts immediately after your first appearance before
the District Court.

The Garda√≠ can take a long time to put together a book of evidence especially
if the case is complex and there are many witnesses.
