##  What are Long-Term Carers Contributions?

A new Long-Term Carers Contribution scheme was introduced in January 2024 to
help long-term carers access the State Pension (Contributory) when they reach
pension age.

Under the scheme, if you have been a full-time carer for at least 20 years
(1,040 weeks), you can get Long-Term Carers Contributions to help you qualify
for the [ State Pension (Contributory)
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/social-welfare-
payments/older-and-retired-people/state-pension-contributory/) .

A Long-Term Carers Contribution is the same as a paid contribution on your
PRSI record for each week that you provide full-time care. The contribution
makes it easier for you to qualify for the State Pension Contributory when you
reach pension age.
