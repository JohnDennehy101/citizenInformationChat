###  Temporary guardianship

A parent can nominate you to act as a _temporary guardian_ of their child if
they are unable to carry out their own guardianship duties – for example, if
they become seriously ill or injured.

The parent must [ complete a special form (pdf) ](https://www.treoir.ie/wp-
content/uploads/2018/03/nomination-form.pdf) to nominate you and they can set
out any wishes they have regarding the temporary guardianship.

You (the nominated person) must then apply to the District Court if the parent
cannot carry out their parental role due to illness or injury. Your specific
rights as a temporary guardian will be explained in the court order. This is
usually the same as the parent’s wishes, as set out in their nomination form.
