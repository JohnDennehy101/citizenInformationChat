##  I was granted access or custody, but still cannot see my grandchild

If you already have an _access order_ or a _custody order_ from the court, but
you are still not getting contact with your grandchild, you can seek an
_enforcement order_ from the court.

An enforcement order is a further legal instruction to the parents or
guardians that they must allow you to see your grandchild, at the specific
times set out in the order. The enforcement order may allow additional access
to compensate for lost time, reimbursement for any wasted expenses or require
those involved to attend a parenting programme or counselling.

If the parents or guardians refuse to comply with an access or custody order,
they can be fined up to â‚¬2,500, go to prison for up to 12 months, or both.

To apply for an enforcement order, you must [ send a completed Form 58.43
