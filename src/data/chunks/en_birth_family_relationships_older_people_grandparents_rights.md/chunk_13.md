##  Appealing the court’s decision

The District Court makes decisions about access, custody and guardianship
applications based on the child’s best interests.

If you are not satisfied with the court’s decision, you can make an appeal
**within 14 days** of the decision being made.

To make an appeal, you must complete a form called a ‘Notice of Appeal to
District Court’. This form, which is sometimes called a _Form 101.1_ , lets
you explain your reasons for appeal. [ Download the ‘Notice Of Appeal to
