##  Becoming a guardian

_Guardianship_ means you have legal responsibility for certain decisions and
to carry out duties in relation to a child's upbringing. For example,
decisions about their medical or dental treatment, or their religious or
cultural upbringing.

As a grandparent, or other relative carer, you can apply to your local
District Court for guardianship if:

  * You have provided the day-to-day care of the child for at least 12 months in a row **and**
  * There is no parent or guardian willing (or able) to carry out guardianship responsibilities in respect of the child 

You can also apply for guardianship if the child’s parents die without
appointing a guardian in their will.

A person can apply for guardianship up until a child reaches 18 years of age.

To apply for guardianship, you must complete a form called a ‘Notice of
application by an eligible person to be appointed a guardian’. This form,
which is sometimes called a _Form 58.30_ , can be submitted to [ your local
District Court ](https://www.courts.ie/content/find-us) . [ Download the
