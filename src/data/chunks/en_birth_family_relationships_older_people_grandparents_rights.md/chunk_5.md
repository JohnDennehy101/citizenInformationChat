##  Applying for custody of a grandchild

If you have _custody_ of a child, you are responsible for their day-to-day
care, accommodation and upbringing.

Any relative, including a grandparent, can apply to their [ local District
Court ](https://www.courts.ie/content/find-us) for custody of a child.

Usually, the court will only grant you custody if it has the parents’ or
guardians’ consent. However, the court can _dispense with the consent_ (decide
that the parents’ consent is not needed) if a custody order is in the child’s
best interests.

If you are granted custody of your grandchild and they are to live with you,
the court can _specify_ (give you details) of the contact, if any, that the
child must have with their parent(s).

You should get professional legal advice before making an application for
custody. See ‘Getting legal advice and other supports’ below. You can also
find more information in our page [ custody of a child ](/en/birth-family-
