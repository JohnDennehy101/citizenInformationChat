###  Getting financial support

If you are the main carer of the child, and the child is not being properly
maintained financially by either or both parents, you can apply to the
District Court for a [ maintenance order ](/en/birth-family-
relationships/separation-and-divorce/maintenance-orders-and-agreements/) .
This means that, if the court grants your application, the parent(s) must give
you money towards the care of the child.

You may also be eligible to claim the [ Guardianâ€™s Payment ](/en/social-
welfare/death-related-benefits/guardian-and-orphan-payments/) from the
Department of Social Protection.

It is not necessary to be a legally appointed guardian. You may get this
payment if the child lives with you, and you are responsible for their care.
