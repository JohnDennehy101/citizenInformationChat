##  I was granted access or custody, but my circumstances have changed

The terms set out in your _access order_ or _custody order_ do not have to
last forever.

If your circumstances change, you can apply to the court for a _variation
order_ . This means the court will update some (or all) aspects of the access
or custody order. You can also ask the court to cancel the original access or
custody order altogether.

To apply for a variation order, you must [ send a completed Form 58.21 (docx)
