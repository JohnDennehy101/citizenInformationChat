##  After the transition period

The Withdrawal Agreement guarantees certain rights for people living outside
their countries of origin. The following people can continue to work or study
in their host country with the same conditions as before:

  * EU citizens lawfully working in the UK before the end of the transition period 
  * UK nationals lawfully working in an EU member state before the end of the transition period 
  * Their relevant family members living in the host country 

They will keep all their workers' rights based on EU law. For example, they
will keep:

  * The right to take up and pursue work in the same way as nationals of the host state 
  * The right to unemployment assistance under the same conditions as the nationals of the host state 
  * The right to social and tax advantages 
  * The right to join a union 
  * Housing rights 
  * The right for their children to access education
