##  How the Minister decides on your application

The International Protection Act sets out what the Minister should consider
when making a decision to grant or refuse permission to remain.

  * The nature of your connection to Ireland 
  * Humanitarian considerations 
  * Your character and conduct both in Ireland and abroad, including criminal convictions 
  * National security and public order 
  * Any other considerations of the common good 

The Minister must also consider if there is a risk that returning you to
another country could lead you to suffer harm. In particular, the Minister
will consider if you are at risk of [ torture, degrading treatment
](/en/moving-country/asylum-seekers-and-refugees/the-asylum-process-in-
ireland/refugees-asylum-seekers-introduction#l5c4cf) or of facing the death
penalty.

The Minister uses the information you gave during your application for
international protection to make a decision. You can send further information
if you want to.

If the Minister decides to grant you leave to remain, you will get a letter
that says you have been granted permission to remain in the State under
Section 49 of the International Protection Act. You must [ register with your
local immigration registration office ](/en/moving-country/moving-to-
ireland/rights-of-residence-in-ireland/registration-of-non-eea-nationals-in-
ireland/) . You will get a [ Stamp 4 permission
](https://www.irishimmigration.ie/registering-your-immigration-
permission/information-on-registering/immigration-permission-stamps/) , which
allows you to work without an employment permit.
