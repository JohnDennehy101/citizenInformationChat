##  Decisions and appeals

If you have appealed the IPOâ€™s recommendation that you should not be granted
refugee or subsidiary protection status, you may get a decision on your
permission to remain application before your appeal is heard.

If you get permission to remain, you can choose to withdraw your appeal. You
do not have to withdraw your appeal. You can register and get a Stamp 4 Irish
Residence Permit and wait for the outcome of your international protection
appeal. You will continue to be considered as an international protection
applicant, and you can only work if you apply for [ Labour Market Access
Permission ](https://www.irishimmigration.ie/my-situation-has-changed-since-i-
arrived-in-ireland/labour-market-access-permission/) .

You cannot appeal a refusal of your permission to remain application. But if
your international protection appeal is refused, you will get a Permission to
Remain Review Form to complete. You can use this form to tell the Minister
about any changes in your circumstances since the Minister refused to grant
you permission to remain.

You should consult with your solicitor about what to do if your permission to
remain is refused. Your solicitor may suggest making an application for a [
judicial review ](/en/government-in-ireland/how-government-works/standards-
and-accountability/judicial-review-public-decisions/) of the decision. This
involves going to court to argue that the decision making process was flawed.

You may also [ voluntarily return ](https://ireland.iom.int/return-and-
reintegration) to your own country.

If you have been refused permission to remain and decide not to return
voluntarily to your own country, the Minister may issue a [ deportation order
](https://www.irishimmigration.ie/my-situation-has-changed-since-i-arrived-in-
ireland/spouse-civil-partner-of-irish-national-scheme/repatriation-division/)
