##  How to apply for Injury Benefit

You should apply for Injury Benefit within 6 weeks of becoming unfit for work.
If you apply after 6 weeks, you may not get the payment.

To apply, you need to get:

  1. An Injury Benefit claim form (IB1) from your doctor 
  2. A medical certificate (Certificate of Incapacity for Work) from your doctor 

If your doctor submits your medical certificate online, you will get a receipt
for your records. If your doctor cannot complete the medical certificate
online, they will give you a paper copy.

A medical certificate must be sent every week for as long as you are unfit to
work.

You can send your completed form (and medical certificate if not submitted
online) by Freepost to the Injury Benefit Section – see ‘Where to apply’
below.
