##  What is Injury Benefit?

Injury Benefit is one of the benefits you can get under the [ Occupational
Injuries Benefit Scheme ](/en/social-welfare/disability-and-
illness/occupational-injuries-benefit-overview/) . It is a weekly payment. You
can get it if you are unfit for work due to:

  * An accident at work 
  * An accident while travelling directly to or from work (on an unbroken journey) 
  * An occupational disease. This is a disease you get from the work that you do. The Department Social Protection (DSP) has a [ list of Prescribed Occupational Diseases ](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/dfb66f-operational-guidelines-injury-benefit/#prescribed-diseases) . 

To get Injury Benefit, you must be unfit for work for more than 3 days as a
result of the accident or disease. The 3 days do not include Sundays and paid
holiday leave.

If you are unfit for work for 3 days or less, you can get a declaration that
you had an occupational accident. It is important to get this declaration in
case your injury or disease causes illness or disability at a later date. It
safeguards your future rights to benefits under the Occupational Injuries
Benefit Scheme.

[ Injury Benefit is taxable ](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-
system/claiming-a-social-welfare-payment/taxation-of-social-welfare-payments/)
but you are unlikely to pay tax if it is your only income.
