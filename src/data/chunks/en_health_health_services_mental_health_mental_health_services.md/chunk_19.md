###  Residential units

**High-support group home** : This is a home for people who do not need to be
in hospital and who can live in the community but who require 24-hour nursing
care and support for a variety of reasons. Some people may spend a period of
time in a high support residence and then move on into a medium or low support
residence.

**Medium-support group home:** This is a home for people who are fairly
independent in most areas of their everyday living skills but who require some
assistance or support in certain areas, for example, managing finances or
cooking skills. For this reason, the home is staffed, usually by day only, by
either a nurse or a trained care staff.

**Low-support group home:** These residential units are for individuals who
are independent in most, if not all, areas of their everyday living skills.
The overall upkeep and management of the group home is co-ordinated by the
hospital management. The residents may have a community psychiatric nurse or
supervisor who will check on them as required.
