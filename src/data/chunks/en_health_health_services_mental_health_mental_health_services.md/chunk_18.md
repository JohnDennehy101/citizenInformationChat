###  **In-patient services**

In-patient services are usually medical and nursing care provided in a
hospital.

If you are admitted to hospital, you are assessed and treated in an area
called an acute admission ward. After treatment, most patients will be
discharged home for follow-up care by the out-patients clinic or day hospital.
Some patients may be transferred from an admission unit to a continuing care
ward or a rehabilitation ward according to their needs.

Sometimes it may be necessary to care for and treat a patient in a safe and
restricted environment. This is usually a small unit within a hospital setting
staffed by highly trained psychiatric nurses. The unit is locked and the
environment is secure.
