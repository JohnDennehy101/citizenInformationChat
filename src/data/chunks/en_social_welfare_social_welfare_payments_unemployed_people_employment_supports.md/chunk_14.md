##  Jobseeker’s payments and activation

If you are getting a Jobseeker’s payment, you may have to participate in an
activation programme. ‘Activation’ means the Department of Social Protection
works with you to support you back into employment.

You are expected to fully engage and use the supports offered to you during
the activation process. This can include education or training schemes, or
employment support schemes, to help you back into the workplace.

People who do not engage with the activation process can have their
jobseeker’s payment reduced, and subsequently [ be disqualified from their
payment ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/unemployed-
people/rules-for-getting-a-jobseekers-payment/#ef21b9) for up to 9 weeks.

However, if you are over 62, [ you may not have to engage with the activation
process ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/unemployed-
people/older-jobseekers/) .
