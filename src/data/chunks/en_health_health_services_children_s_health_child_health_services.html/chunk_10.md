##  Hospital charges for children

From 21 September 2022 in-patient services are free for children aged under 16
in all public hospitals.

If your child is admitted to a public hospital for treatment of health issues
found at child and school health checks, they do not have to pay the usual in-
patient public [ hospital charges ](/en/health/health-services/gp-and-
hospital-services/hospital-charges/) .

There are a number of [ children's hospitals
](https://www.hse.ie/eng/about/who/acute-hospitals-division/hospital-
groups/childrens-hospital-group/) in Ireland. Children’s hospitals provide in-
patient services, out-patient services, day care, accident and emergency
services and specialist services for children. Entitlement to [ hospital
services ](/en/health/health-services/gp-and-hospital-services/hospital-
services-introduction/) is the same in children’s hospitals as in public and
voluntary hospitals.
