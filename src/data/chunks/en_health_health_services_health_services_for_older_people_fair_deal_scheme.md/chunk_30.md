##  Nursing Home Loan

The Nursing Home Loan is an optional element of the Fair Deal scheme. It is an
option if the person in nursing home care has assets including land and
property.

If you are approved for the Nursing Home Loan, the contribution based on your
assets (land or property) can be postponed. This means the HSE will pay the
money to the nursing home for you, and it will be collected after your death
or after the sale of all or part of your asset.

In certain circumstances the payment may be deferred for a longer period, for
example, [ if a spouse or partner or your former carer is still living in your
home ](https://www2.hse.ie/services/schemes-allowances/fair-deal-
scheme/nursing-home-loan/#deferring-repayment-of-the-nursing-home-loan) .

Repayment of the loan is made to [ the Revenue Commissioners
](https://www.revenue.ie/en/life-events-and-personal-circumstances/nursing-
