###  Applying for the Nursing Home Loan

If you want to apply for the Nursing Home Loan, see Part 5 of the [ Fair Deal
application form (pdf)
](https://assets.hse.ie/media/documents/HSE_Nursing_Homes_Support_Scheme_Application_form_and_support_information.pdf)
for information and application details. You can apply for the Nursing Home
Loan when you first apply for Fair Deal or at any stage while resident in the
nursing home.

To apply for the Nursing Home Loan, you must provide written consent to having
a Charging Order registered against your asset. If you are part of a couple,
your spouse or partner must also provide written consent. The Charging Order
is a simple type of mortgage which secures the money loaned by the HSE.

After you consent, the HSE is responsible for making the Charging Order,
registering it against your asset and making Nursing Home Loan payments on
your behalf. You will not need to do anything (although the HSE may need to
check with you about the information in your application).

If a person does not have the capacity to consent to the Nursing Home Loan and
the Charging Order, only one of the following can apply for them:

  * A care representative (a person appointed by Circuit Court) 
  * A Ward of Court (a person appointed by Office of Ward of Courts) 
  * A holder of a registered enduring power of attorney (chosen to act on behalf of another person) 

See 'How to apply for someone else as a specified person?' below.

You can apply for the optional nursing home loan and if you are approved, you
do not have to avail if you change your mind.
