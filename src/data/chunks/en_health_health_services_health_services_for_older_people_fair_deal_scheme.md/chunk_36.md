####  Appeals

When the HSE writes to you about the outcome of your Care Needs and Financial
Assessments, it will outline the appeals process and give you details of your
local Appeals Office.

For example, if your Care Needs Assessment finds that you do not need long-
term nursing home care, you can appeal the decision to your local Appeals
Office.
