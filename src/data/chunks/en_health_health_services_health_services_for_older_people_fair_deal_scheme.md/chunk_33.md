###  Who is a specified person?

If you are helping someone with reduced decision-making capacity to apply for
Fair Deal, you need to be a specified person. A specified person may apply on
behalf of a person needing care if they are unable to apply themselves.

A specified person is:

**First priority**

**A.** Your [ decision-making representative ](/en/health/legal-matters-and-
health/decision-making-representative-order/) (a person appointed by the
Circuit Court)

**B.** A person appointed under an [ enduring power of attorney
](/en/death/before-a-death/power-of-attorney#l73f44) who is not restricted
from applying for the scheme

**C.** Your Committee, if you are a [ ward of court ](/en/health/legal-
matters-and-health/wards-of-court/)

**Lesser priority**

**D.** Your spouse or partner

**E.** A child of yours who is 18 or over

**F.** A registered medical practitioner, nurse or social worker

If you had a care representative, they are now called a decision-making
representative (DMR). They can still act on your behalf.
