####  Reviews

Any Care Needs Assessment can be reviewed six months after a previous
assessment or earlier if one of the following apply:

  * The HSE believes there has been a material (significant) change in your health or circumstances 
  * A registered medical practitioner states that there has been a material change in your health or circumstances since your most recent care needs assessment 

Your [ local Nursing Home Support Office ](https://www2.hse.ie/services/fair-
deal-scheme/contact-a-nursing-homes-support-office.html) carries out the
review. Contact them if you want to have your Care Needs or Financial
Assessment reviewed.

After the HSE decides, they will write to you with the decision and the
reasons for it within 10 working days.
