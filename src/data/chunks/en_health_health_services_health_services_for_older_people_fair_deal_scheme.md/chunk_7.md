###  Moving from hospital care to long-term care

If you are in hospital, but no longer need acute care, then you can be charged
for long-term care in that hospital. If you are waiting to move to long-term
care, then you should apply for Fair Deal as soon as you can.

In a limited number of cases, the HSE may pay for your care in a private
nursing home while your application for Fair Deal is being processed. This is
known as Transitional Care Funding.
