###  Payment of your contribution

If you select a public or voluntary nursing home, you pay the contribution to
the HSE, and the HSE will then pay the nursing home.

If you select a private nursing home, you pay your contribution to the nursing
home and the HSE pays the rest.

Financial support will only be paid if the nursing home is identified as being
appropriate to your needs.
