###  Step 3: Complete a Financial Assessment

The Financial Assessment works out how much you can pay towards your nursing
home care. The HSE will pay the remaining balance of the weekly cost of your
care.

For example, if the total weekly cost of your care is €1,000 and your weekly
contribution is €300, the HSE will pay €700. This payment by the HSE is called
State support.

The Financial Assessment looks at all of your income and assets.

If you are part of a couple, the assessment will be based on half of your
combined income and assets.

A couple is either:

  * A married couple living together 
  * An opposite or same-sex couple living together as life partners for at least three years 

It does not include relatives who live together, or two adults living together
but not as life partners.
