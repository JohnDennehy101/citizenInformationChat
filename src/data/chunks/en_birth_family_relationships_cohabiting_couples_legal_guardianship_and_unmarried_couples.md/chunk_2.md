##  Introduction

If you are a guardian of a child in Ireland, you have a legal responsibility
to maintain and properly care for the child. You also have the right to make
decisions about the child's religious upbringing, their education, consent to
medical treatment and their general welfare.

You can apply for guardianship up until a child reaches 18 years of age.
Guardianship ends when a child turns 18 unless a guardian dies or is removed
before that.

Guardianship can be:

  * Automatic guardianship 
  * Guardianship by agreement 
  * Testamentary guardianship 
  * Guardianship decided by the court 

The rights of parents to guardianship are set out in Section 6 of the [
Guardianship of Infants Act, 1964
