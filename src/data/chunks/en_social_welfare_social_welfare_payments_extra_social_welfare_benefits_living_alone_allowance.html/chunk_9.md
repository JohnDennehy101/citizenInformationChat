  * Live alone during the day but stay with relatives or friends at night or if you live alone during the week but have a relative to stay at the weekend (the living alone condition is satisfied as long as the relative has a permanent home address elsewhere) 
  * Live alone but occasionally take in paying guests (for example, during a local festival) - but if you run a bed and breakfast business (even for part of the year) you will not qualify
