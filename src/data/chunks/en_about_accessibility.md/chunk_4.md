##  Compliance status

Citizensinformation.ie is partially conformant with WCAG 2.1 level AA.
Partially conformant means that some parts of the content do not fully conform
to the accessibility standard. The items listed below are noted, and we have a
plan in place to ensure these comply very soon:

  * The cookie banner and pop up modal window that allow you to accept or reject cookies on our website are not fully accessible. We are working to ensure that they are accessible. 
  * Some tables on our website are not fully accessible. We are working to fix these and ensure they are accessible to people using screen readers. 
  * Interactive Controls pose challenges for screen reader users. We have plans to improve this. 
  * The maps within our Centres pages are inaccessible to keyboard users. 
  * Our custom keyboard focus outline does not meet colour contrast requirements so can be difficult to see for users with low vision. 
  * Our main navigation on some pages can pose challenges for users of assistive technology. 
  * Some of our pages’ heading structure is not correctly conveyed to users of assistive technology. 
  * Our ‘skip to main content’ links are inaccessible to keyboard users. 

If any of our content is not easily accessible, please contact us directly
(see the details below).
