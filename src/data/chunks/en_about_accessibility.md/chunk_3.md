##  Measures to support accessibility

CIB takes the following measures to ensure accessibility of
citizensinformation.ie:

  * Include accessibility in our internal policies 
  * Publish HTML webpages as standard, reducing the use of printed materials and PDFs as much as possible. If PDFs do need to be used, we will ensure that theyhave a high standard of accessibility. 
  * We have recently engaged with an external accessibility partner, and carried out a full independent accessibility audit of citizensinformation.ie. This is to assess our conformance with the [ Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 level AA ](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/) . We are reviewing and implementing the findings of the audit. We have a continual Service Improvement plan in place with our accessibility partner, and have a roadmap in place to ensure all our other websites are audited, to achieve a high standard of accessibility.
