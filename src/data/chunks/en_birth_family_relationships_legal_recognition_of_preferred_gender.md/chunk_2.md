##  Introduction

Since September 2015, trans people in Ireland can apply to have their
preferred gender legally recognised by the State. This is set out in the [
Gender Recognition Act 2015
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2015/act/25/enacted/en/html) .

Anyone over 18 can apply to change their gender. You can also apply if you are
aged 16 or 17, but the process is slightly different and may take longer. If
you are under 16, it is not possible to change your gender that is recognised
by the State.

When you legally change your gender, you are given a gender recognition
certificate. This certificate can also state your new name, if you have chosen
to change it. Read about legally [ changing your name by deed poll
](/en/birth-family-relationships/problems-in-marriages-and-other-
relationships/changing-your-name/) .

Once you have a gender recognition certificate, you can then apply for a
revised birth certificate.

Legal recognition of your new gender is not retrospective. This means that any
rights, responsibilities and consequences of actions by you before the date of
recognition remain unaffected. In other words, your preferred gender will
start to be legally recognised from the date of recognition, and not before.
