##  Getting a revised birth certificate

When you get your gender recognition certificate, you can then apply for a
revised birth certificate if you are registered in either:

  * The Register of Births 
  * The Adopted Children Register 
  * The Register of Intercountry adoptions 
  * The Foreign Births Register
