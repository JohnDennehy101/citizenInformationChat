###  Reversal of gender recognition certificate

Where you hold a gender recognition certificate and you want to revert to your
original gender, Section 15 of the Gender Recognition Act 2015 allows you to
apply to revoke your certificate in a similar process as your initial
application for legal recognition of your preferred gender. There is a similar
but more detailed revocation process for those between 16 and 18.

Under Section 14 of the Act, a gender recognition certificate can also be
revoked where information is received that would have led to the refusal of
the certificate, had it been received prior to it being issued.
