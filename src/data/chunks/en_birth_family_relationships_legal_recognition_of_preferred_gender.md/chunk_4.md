##  Changing your gender at age 16 or 17

The process for changing your gender depends on your age.

If you are aged 16 or 17, you can ask an adult (normally your parent or
guardian - also referred to as next friend of the child) to apply for a
**gender recognition certificate** on your behalf.

First, they will need to apply to the Circuit Family Court to exempt you from
the over-18 age restriction. The Court can grant the exemption if you have:

  1. The consent of a parent or guardian 
  2. A [ form from your medical practitioner ](https://www.courts.ie/content/certificate-medical-practitioner-s-124-gender-recognition-act-2015-application-gender) certifying that, in their professional medical opinion, you have the maturity and understanding to make this decision for yourself. They must also certify that you have transitioned (or are currently transitioning) into your preferred gender. 
  3. A [ form from a psychiatrist or endocrinologist ](https://www.courts.ie/content/certificate-endocrinologist-or-psychiatrist-section-124-gender-recognition-act-2015-%E2%80%94) certifying that they agree with the medical practitioner. 

If the court grants the exemption, you or the adult can apply for a gender
recognition certificate on your behalf. See _Applying for a gender recognition
certificate_ below for details.

**Note:** In November 2019, the Department of Social Protection [ published a
report ](https://www.gov.ie/pdf/69547/?page=1) proposing a [ simplified path
to legal gender recognition ](https://www.gov.ie/en/press-
release/43aef0-minister-doherty-publishes-her-report-on-the-review-of-the-
gender-re/) for people aged 16 to 17. The report was published after a [
review of the Gender Recognition Act 2015 (pdf)
