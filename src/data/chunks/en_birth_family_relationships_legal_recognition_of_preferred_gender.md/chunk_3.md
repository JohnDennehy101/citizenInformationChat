###  Before 2015

In 2007, the High Court ruled that Ireland was in breach of the European
Convention on Human Rights in not having a process to legally recognise the
acquired gender of transgender people.

As a result, a Gender Recognition Advisory Group was set up. The group advised
on the legislation required to allow transgender people have their preferred
gender legally recognised.
