##  In which court will my case be heard?

Whether your case is heard in the [ District Court ](/en/justice/courts-
system/district-court/) , the [ Circuit Court ](/en/justice/courts-
system/circuit-court/) or the [ High Court ](/en/justice/courts-system/high-
court/) will depend on the value of your case, that is, how much you claim the
defendant should pay you.

If you have been injured in an accident, the value of your case will be
assessed by your legal representatives based on doctors' reports about the
nature and extent of your injuries and the prognosis for the future.

The District Court has power to award up to €15,000 in damages. The Circuit
Court has power to award up to €75,000 in damages. The High Court has
unlimited power to award damages.

It is important to note that, if your case is heard in Circuit Court and you
are awarded less than €15,000 in damages, or in the High Court and you are
awarded less than €75,000 in damages, you may be penalised in costs.

This means that even though you have won your case, you may be obliged to pay
the extra costs incurred by both sides by having the case heard in the higher
court.
