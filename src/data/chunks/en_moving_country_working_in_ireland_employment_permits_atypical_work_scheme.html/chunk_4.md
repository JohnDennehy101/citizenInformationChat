##  Atypical Scheme for crew members of fishingfleets

From 31 December 2022, you can no longer apply for the Atypical Working Scheme
if you are a crewmember of an Irish-registered fishing boat. This is because
an employment permit scheme for crew members is planned to begin in 2023.

Instead of applying for the Scheme, you can get a Stamp 4 immigration
permission. If you have a Stamp 4 immigration permission, you can work without
an employment permit.

You can get a Stamp 4 immigration permission if you hold:

  * A valid Irish Residence Permit (IRP) card which expires on or after 1 January 2023 
  * A letter of permission to work on a fishing crew issued under the Scheme on or after 3 October 2022 

If your permission to work under the Atypical Working Scheme expired on or
before 31 December 2022 and you have not renewed this, you cannot get a Stamp
4 immigration permission.

To get a Stamp 4 immigration permission, you should make an appointment with
your local immigration office.

You can read more about how to get a Stamp 4 immigration permission on the [
Irish Immigration Service website ](https://www.irishimmigration.ie/sea-
