##  Redress scheme for cohabiting couples

If you have been living with your partner and your relationship ends, you may
be able to avail of the [ Redress scheme for cohabiting couples ](/en/birth-
family-relationships/problems-in-marriages-and-other-relationships/redress-
scheme-for-cohabiting-couples/) . The aim of the redress scheme is to protect
a financially dependent member of the couple if the long-term cohabiting
relationship ends (either through death or separation).

Under the redress scheme, cohabiting couples can get similar orders from the
court as are available to married couples when they separate or divorce if the
court is satisfied that one of you was financially dependent on the other.

To apply for court orders under the redress scheme, you must be a qualified
cohabitant. This means you must have been:

  * Living together in an intimate and committed relationship for at least 5 years, or 
  * Living together in an intimate and committed relationship for 2 years if you have had a child with your partner 

The rules of the scheme are set out in the [ Civil Partnership and Certain
Rights and Obligations of Cohabitants Act 2010
](https://www.lawreform.ie/_fileupload/RevisedActs/WithAnnotations/HTML/en_act_2010_0024.htm)
.

In certain circumstances, if your partner dies when you are still in a
relationship together, you can apply to the court for a portion of their
estate, but it is not necessary to prove that you were financially dependent
on them. You must apply within 6 months after the probate or administration is
first granted. A gift or inheritance taken on foot of a court order under Part
15 of the Civil Partnerships and Certain Rights and Obligations of Cohabitants
Act 2010, is exempt from Capital Acquisitions Tax (CAT) including a benefit
from the net estate of your deceased partner.
