##  Main legal differences between marriage and living together

Many couples decide that they do not want to get married for many different
reasons. But if you decide to live together, it is important to understand how
this might impact you if your relationship breaks down or ends through death.
The following table outlines some of the main differences.

****

|  **Married couples** |  **Couples living together**  
---|---|---  
**Property and the family home** |  The family home of a married couple is protected in legislation. One spouse or civil partner cannot sell, mortgage, lease or transfer the family/shared home without the consent of the other spouse or civil partner.  If your spouse or civil partner dies, you do not have to pay Capital Acquisitions Tax on any inheritance you receive from them.  |  If you are living with your partner in _their_ house, they do not need your written consent before they can sell or lease the house.  Even if you are joint tenants (you both co-own the property in equal shares), if you are not married and your partner dies, you (the surviving joint tenant of the property) may be liable for Capital Acquisition Tax as a result of becoming full owner of the property through survivorship.   
**Children and guardianship** |  Married parents are automatically joint guardians of their children and have equal rights in relation to their children. Neither separation nor divorce changes this.  |  All mothers, whether they are married or not married, have automatic guardianship to their children. A father who is not married to the mother of his child does not have automatic guardianship rights.   
**Children and financial responsibility** |  Both parents are responsible for financially supporting their children.   
**Inheritance** |  If you are married or in a civil partnership, your surviving partner has the right to a share of your estate (your possessions) when you die, no matter what you have said in your will.  Spouses and civil partners are not liable for Capital Acquisitions Tax (CAT) on inheritances from each other.  |  If you have been living together with your partner and you die without a will, your partner has no automatic right to any share of your estate no matter how long you have been together.  Even if your partner has provided for you in their will, you will be treated as strangers for Capital Acquisitions Tax purposes in terms of your inheritance. Cohabiting partners pay tax at 33% on gifts/inheritance over â‚¬16,250.   
**Inheritance and children** |  Children (no age restrictions) have the same inheritance rights from their parents' whether their parents are married or not.   
**Pensions for surviving spouses or partners** |  If your spouse or civil partner dies, you may qualify for a Widow's, Widower's or Surviving Civil Partner's (Contributory) Pension.  |  You cannot qualify for a Widow's, Widower's or Surviving Civil Partner's Pension no matter how long you have been together.
