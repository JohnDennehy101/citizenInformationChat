###  **Aged Under 66**

If you become ill and are unable to work before you are 66, you can apply for
[ Illness Benefit ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-
welfare/social-welfare-payments/disability-and-illness/disability-benefit/) .
Contact your GP for an application form.

Illness Benefit is based on [ PRSI contributions
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-
system/social-insurance-prsi/social-insurance/) . If you do not qualify
because you do not have enough PRSI contributions or because you are self-
employed, you may be eligible for a weekly [ Supplementary Welfare Allowance
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/social-welfare-
payments/supplementary-welfare-schemes/supplementary-welfare-allow/) .

If your illness or disability arises from a work-related accident or illness,
you may qualify for [ Occupational Injuries Benefit
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/social-welfare-
payments/disability-and-illness/injury-benefit/) .
