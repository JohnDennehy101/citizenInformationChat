###  **Help with home care**

If you need support to continue living at home, you may get help from the [
Community Care Services ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/health/health-
services/care-in-your-community/community-care-services/) section of the HSE.

You may also be able to get the [ Home Support Service
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/health/health-services/health-
services-for-older-people/home-support-service/) , to help you continue living
in your own home. This was previously called the ‘Home Care Package Scheme’.

[ Public health nurses ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/health/health-
services/care-in-your-community/public-health-nurses/) can give you nurse care
if you live at home.

If you pay for a carer to look after a family member (either directly or
through an agency), you may qualify for [ tax relief on the costs of employing
a carer ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/money-and-tax/tax/tax-credits-
and-reliefs-for-people-with-disabilities/tax-relief-for-employing-a-home-
carer/) .
