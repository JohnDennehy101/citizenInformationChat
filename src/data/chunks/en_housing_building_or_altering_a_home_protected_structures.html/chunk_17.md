###  **How is a structure removed from the RPS?**

If a structure is to be deleted from the list, the same process must be
followed. Details of the structure proposed for deletion must be displayed in
public and any comments or objections must be taken into account by the
elected members of the planning authority when making their decision.

The process to add or delete a structure from the RPS is set-out in the [
Planning and Development Act 2000
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2000/en/act/pub/0030/sec0057.html) .
