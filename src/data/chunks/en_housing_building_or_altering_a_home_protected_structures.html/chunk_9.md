####  **How do I apply for a** **Built Heritage Investment Scheme grant?**

Funding is allocated to the Built Heritage Investment Scheme each year and the
local authorities manage it. You apply to your local authority for the grant
by the deadline, which is usually the end of January each year.

In March, the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage publishes [
the list of projects
](https://www.gov.ie/pdf/?file=https://assets.gov.ie/287926/6b2bb0a8-c690-4596-87db-514225aa4f85.pdf#page=null)
that get funding for the year.

If you miss the deadline for applying, you will need to wait till next year.
However, a small amount of emergency funding for urgent conservation repairs
to historic structures may be available outside the annual grant cycle. For
example, you might get this for time-sensitive repairs to a structure that has
been severely damaged by a storm. These applications will be considered by the
Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage on a case-by-case basis.

If you have questions about the grant or need help applying, the Department of
Housing, Local Government and Heritage has additional information in their [
Guidance Booklet for Applicants

and their [ Guidance Circular for Local Authorities
](https://www.gov.ie/pdf/?file=https://assets.gov.ie/275226/aec3034e-7d6d-4f41-b75f-65f8dad8e982.pdf#page=null)
. You can also contact your local authority if you have questions about the
scheme.

**You can only apply for one BHIS grant per historic structure. You cannot get
funding under the Historic Structures Fund and the Built Heritage Scheme in
the same year.**
