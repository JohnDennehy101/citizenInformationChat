###  **What is the Built Heritage Investment Scheme?**

The Built Heritage Investment Scheme (BHIS) provides grants to help repair and
conserve structures that are protected under the Planning and Development
Acts. It also helps to conserve structures in Architectural Conservation
Areas.

The BHIS is aimed at privately owned properties that need repair and
conservation. Projects that incorporate a traditional skills training element
may also be supported by this fund.
