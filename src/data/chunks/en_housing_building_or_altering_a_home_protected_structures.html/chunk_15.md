###  **Assessing if a structure is of special interest**

A planning authority decides if a structure should be included in the Record
of Protected Structures (RPS) by identifying characteristics of special
interest under the following headings:

  * Architectural 
  * Historical 
  * Archaeological 
  * Artistic 
  * Cultural 
  * Scientific 
  * Technical 
  * Social 

The assessment process should be impartial and objective.
