###  **What is the Historic Structures Fund?**

If you own a protected structure and it needs urgent repairs, you may be able
to get a grant under the Historic Structures Fund (HSF).

The Historic Structures Fund can also be used to care for historic structures
and buildings in public ownership, and to improve recreational infrastructure
and public access to these heritage sites.
