##  Introduction

Under EU law bank charges for financial transactions should be the same within
EU member states and between EU states.

The basic principle is that the charges for financial transactions must be the
same, for payments of the same value, whether the payment is national or
cross-border. You cannot be charged extra fees (for example, annual fees or
once-off charges) for using your card in other EU member states.
