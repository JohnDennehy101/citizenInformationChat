###  Guardian's Payment (Contributory)

If either parent or step-parent had worked at any time and paid PRSI for 26
weeks, the orphan is entitled to the Guardian's Payment (Contributory). This
may be paid for an orphan living in the State or abroad and is not means
tested. Payment is made to the orphan's guardian up to the child's 18th
birthday or 22nd birthday if they are in full-time education.
