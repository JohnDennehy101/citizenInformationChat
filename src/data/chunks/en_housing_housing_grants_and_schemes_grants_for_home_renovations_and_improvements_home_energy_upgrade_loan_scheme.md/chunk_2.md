##  What is the Home Energy Upgrade Loan?

The Home Energy Upgrade Loan is a low-interest loan for homeowners who want to
make their property more energy efficient.

You must use the loan for home energy upgrades that are also funded by a [
home energy upgrade grant ](https://www.seai.ie/grants/home-energy-
grants/home-energy-upgrade-loan/) from the Sustainable Energy Authority of
Ireland (SEAI).

You can get the loan for the home you live in, or a property you rent out.

The loan can be drawn down before you start the work. This removes some of the
upfront financial barriers to getting the upgrade works done.

Loans are available until 31 December 2026 or until the funding runs out.

If you can't afford to make your home more energy efficient, you may qualify
for a free energy upgrade with the [ SEAI Warmer Homes Scheme
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/housing/housing-grants-and-
schemes/grants-for-home-renovations-and-improvements/warmer-homes-scheme/) .
