##  What work is covered by the loan?

You must be getting one of these SEAI home energy upgrade grants to get the
loan:

  * [ Better Energy Homes Grant ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/housing/housing-grants-and-schemes/grants-for-home-renovations-and-improvements/better-energy-homes-scheme/)
  * [ National Home Energy Upgrade Scheme ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/housing/housing-grants-and-schemes/grants-for-home-renovations-and-improvements/grants-for-a-home-energy-upgrade/)
  * [ Community Grant Scheme ](https://www.seai.ie/grants/community-grants/overview/)

The loans can be used for:

  * A deep retrofit of your home. This means upgrading many parts of your home’s structure and energy systems. 
  * 1 or 2 upgrades that will significantly improve the energy performance of your home. 

The work might include:

  * Insulating your home 
  * Installing a heat pump 
  * Upgrading your heating controls 
  * Installing solar power with solar panels 

**You cannot get the loan to install only solar panels** .

However, you can get funding for solar panels as part of a deep retrofit to
your home under the SEAI’s [ National Home Energy Upgrade Scheme
](http://national%20home%20energy%20upgrade%20scheme/%22%20/t%20%22_blank) or
[ Community Grant Scheme ](https://www.seai.ie/grants/community-
grants/overview/) .

If you are just getting a couple of upgrades with the [ Better Energy Homes
Scheme ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/housing/housing-grants-and-
schemes/grants-for-home-renovations-and-improvements/better-energy-homes-
scheme/) , the loan will not cover solar panels. However, 25% of the amount
you borrow can be used for other changes to your home, that could include the
cost of your solar panels.
