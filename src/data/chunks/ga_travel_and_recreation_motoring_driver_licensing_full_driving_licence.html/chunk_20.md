###  **Disqualification threshold**

If you get 12 penalty points in a 3-year period, you are disqualified from
driving for 6 months.

If you have a learner permit, you are disqualified if you have 7 penalty
points. This lower threshold also applies for the first 2 years of your first
full driving licence. More information is available on the [ Road Safety
Authority website ](https://www.rsa.ie/services/licensed-drivers/penalty-
points/how-it-works) .
