###  **Identification**

In most cases, a [ Public Service Card (PSC)
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-
system/public-services-card/) is used to verify your details to process your
application.

If you donâ€™t have a PSC, you will need to submit the following 4 pieces of
documentary evidence:

  1. Photo ID 
  2. Evidence of your address 
  3. Evidence of your PPS number 
  4. Evidence of your normal residence 

You can read more about the types of documents the NDLS will accept as
evidence regarding each of these criteria [ in their guidance notes (pdf)
