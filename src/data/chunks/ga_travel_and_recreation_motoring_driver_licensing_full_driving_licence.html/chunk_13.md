###  **Eyesight report form**

Generally, your medical practitioner will report any eyesight issues in the
Driving Licence Medical Report Form.

But you will need a Driving Licence Eyesight Report Form if you no longer need
glasses or contact lenses to drive (for example if you've had laser eye
surgery).

You can [ download the eyesight report form (pdf)
](http://www.ndls.ie/images/Documents/DrivingLicence/155076_NDLS_Eyesight_Rep_V9_Online_FA_BD_PDFX.pdf)
(pages 1 and 2 should be printed back to back on one page). It is also
available from NDLS centres. You must send it within 1 month of completion.
