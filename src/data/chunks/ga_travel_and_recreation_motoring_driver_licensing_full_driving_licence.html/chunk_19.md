###  **Novice plates**

You must display N-plates on your vehicle when driving for 2 years from the
date your first licence was issued. Motorcycle riders must wear an N-tabard.
The novice period only applies once. So, if you get a licence to drive a
different category of vehicle, you don't have to display N-plates again. More
information is available on the [ Road Safety Authority website
](http://www.rsa.ie/en/RSA/Licensed-Drivers/Driving-licence/Novice-Plates-
Introduction/) .
