##  Property you personally use

The house you live in is not included in the means test, unless you are
getting an income from it.

If you are getting Jobseeker’s Allowance, you can get up to €269.23 a week
(€14,000 per year) for [ renting out a room in your own home
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/housing/owning-a-home/home-
owners/renting-out-a-room-in-your-home/#403a9f) without it affecting your
payment. This does not apply if you are renting to an employee or an immediate
family member. If you get any rental income over €14,000 per year, it will be
assessed.
