##  Cash income

The means test assesses all cash income that you expect to get in the next 12
months. If it is not possible to estimate your income over the next 12 months,
it is usually based on the income you received in the previous year.

Cash income that is assessed includes:

  * [ Income from self-employment ](/en/social-welfare/unemployed-people/self-employed-and-unemployment/)
  * [ Income from employment ](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/means-test-for-social-welfare-payments/work-and-jobseekers-allowance/)
  * [ Farm income ](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/60bc41-operational-guidelines-for-social-welfare-investigators-on-the-asses/?referrer=https://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/Farm-Means---Assessment-of-Income-from-Farming.aspx)
  * Income from a social security pension from another country 
  * [ Income from maintenance ](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/means-test-for-social-welfare-payments/maintenance-and-social-welfare-payments/) , for example, if you are separated. 

Most social welfare payments are not taken into account. The maintenance grant
provided under the [ Student Grant Scheme ](/en/education/third-level-
education/fees-and-supports-for-third-level-education/student-grant-scheme/)
is also not taken into account as means.
