###  Couples

If your spouse, civil partner or cohabitant is getting their own social
welfare payment in their own right (except Child Benefit, Disablement Pension,
[ guardian's payments ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-
welfare/social-welfare-payments/death-related-benefits/guardian-and-orphan-
payments/) , [ Supplementary Welfare Allowance
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/social-welfare-
payments/supplementary-welfare-schemes/supplementary-welfare-allow/) , [
Domiciliary Care Allowance ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-
welfare/social-welfare-payments/disability-and-illness/domiciliary-care-
allowance/) or [ half-rate Carer's Allowance
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/social-welfare-
payments/carers/half-rate-carers-allowance/) ), or if they are on a [ Further
Education and Training (FET)
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/education/further-education-and-
training/training-courses/) or VTOS course and getting a payment, you
**cannot** get an Increase for a Qualified Adult for them.

This means that the maximum you can be paid is the maximum Jobseeker’s
Allowance payment for a single person, plus a half-rate allowance for each
qualified child. Your spouse, civil partner or cohabitant will also get a
half-rate payment for each qualified child with their payment.

Only half (50%) of your combined means are taken into account in the means
test for your Jobseeker’s Allowance – this means **your combined means are
halved** . The other half will be taken into account in the means test for
your partner's payment, if your partner is getting a means-tested payment.
