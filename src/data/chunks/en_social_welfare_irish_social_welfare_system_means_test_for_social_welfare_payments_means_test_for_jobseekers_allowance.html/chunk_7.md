##  Total means

To find your total means, the DSP adds your means from the sources above
together (for example, cash income, employment, capital, benefit and
privilege).

They will deduct (take away) your total household means from the maximum
payment for your situation (see below) to find how much Jobseekerâ€™s Allowance
you can get.
