##  Do I have to pay Residential Zoned Land Tax?

If land is included on the final RZLT map and you are the owner of it on the
liability date, you must pay RZLT unless it is [ property that is excluded
](https://www.revenue.ie/en/property/residential-zoned-land/due-date-excluded-
properties.aspx) .

RZLT does not apply to existing residential properties. If your property is
liable for [ Local Property Tax ](/en/money-and-tax/tax/housing-taxes-and-
reliefs/local-property-tax/) , it is a residential property and you do not
have to pay RZLT for it.

If your residential property has a garden or yard that is larger than 0.4047
hectares (1 acre) and is included on the RZLT map, you have to register for
RZLT but you do not have to pay the tax.
