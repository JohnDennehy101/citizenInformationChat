##  What is the Residential Zoned Land Tax?

A new Residential Zoned Land Tax (RZLT) will be charged each year on land
that:

  * Is zoned for residential use and 
  * Has access to necessary services such as water supply, roads and lighting 

If your property is liable for [ Local Property Tax ](/en/money-and-
tax/tax/housing-taxes-and-reliefs/local-property-tax/) , it is a residential
property and you do not have to pay RZLT for it.
