##  How do I check if land is liable for Residential Zoned Land Tax?

Land that is liable for RZLT is shown on a map.

RZLT maps are published each year by local authorities. [ For 2025, draft maps
were published on 1 February 2024
](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/fbad0-residential-zoned-land-tax/#how-
will-you-be-able-to-view-your-councils-annual-draft-map) . You could make a
submission about land that should be added or removed, up to 1 April 2024.

The final map for 2025 will be published on 31 January 2025.

If your residential property is shown on the map, you do not have to make a
submission to remove it if the property is liable to [ Local Property Tax
](/en/money-and-tax/tax/housing-taxes-and-reliefs/local-property-tax/) because
this means that it will not be liable for RZLT.

If you are a landowner and you make a submission, you can appeal the decision
of a local authority if you do not agree with it.
