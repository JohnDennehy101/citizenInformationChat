##  Jobs and Pensions service

If you are [ starting work ](/en/employment/starting-work-and-changing-
job/starting-work/tax-and-starting-work/) , the [ Jobs and Pensions online
service ](https://www.revenue.ie/en/online-services/services/paye-
services/add-job-pension.aspx) in myAccount allows you to register your first
job or private pension with Revenue. It is also available in ROS.

When you register your job or pension, Revenue will provide you with a [ Tax
Credit Certificate ](how_your_tax_is_calculated.en.html#l11dac) that shows
your rate of tax and tax credits. Revenue will provide your new employer or
pension provider with a Revenue Payroll Notification so that they know how
much tax to deduct from your wages or pension.

When you finish work with an employer, they will let Revenue know that the
employment has ended (you can also use the Jobs and Pensions service to do
this yourself). Your new employer should then register your next job â€“ you
only use the service to register your first job in Ireland.

Revenue has information on [ how to access the Jobs and Pensions service

pension.aspx) .
