##  How to qualify for an apprenticeship

To be eligible for an apprenticeship, you must be at least 16 years of age and
have a minimum of grade D in 5 subjects in the Junior Cycle or equivalent
exam. However, higher educational qualifications and other requirements may be
required by employers.

If you don't have these qualifications, you may still register as an
apprentice with an employer if you:

  * Complete an approved preparatory training course followed by an assessment interview. 
  * Are over 18 years of age and have at least 3 years of relevant work experience, in which case you will also be asked to do an assessment interview. 

You will be asked to pass a colour-vision test for some apprenticeships.

You can find the qualifications needed in the programme information for each [
