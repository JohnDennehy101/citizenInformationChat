###  Law on having personal details up-to-date on your licence

You must always carry your driving licence or learner permit with you when
driving. You are not required by law to change your licence or permit if you
change your name or address. However, it is advisable.

When driving, you are required to show evidence of your licence or permit if
requested by An Garda Síochána, so your licence or permit should contain up-
to-date information.
