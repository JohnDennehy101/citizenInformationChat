####  Deposit account

A deposit account allows you to build up savings and you can earn interest on
this money. Deposit accounts are offered by banks and credit unions. They are
sometimes called savings accounts.

For some accounts, you make deposits at regular times, usually monthly, and
these are called regular savings accounts.

Before you open a deposit account, you should know what rate of interest you
can earn on your savings. If you earn interest on savings, you may have to pay
a tax on the interest called [ Deposit Interest Retention Tax (DIRT)
](/en/money-and-tax/tax/tax-on-savings-and-investments/deposit-interest-
retention-tax/) .

You should also find out how you can access your money if you need it. Some
deposit accounts may have restrictions on how soon or how often you can
withdraw money.

A deposit account is not your only option â€“ you can save money in other ways,
for example, through [ State Savings ](https://www.statesavings.ie/) .
