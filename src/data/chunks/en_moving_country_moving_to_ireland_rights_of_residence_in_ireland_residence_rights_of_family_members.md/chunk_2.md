##  Introduction

If you move to Ireland you may be able to bring your Non-EEA family members to
live with you. Your right to have your family join you in Ireland depends on:

  * Your residence status in Ireland 
  * Your family relationship with the person 

In some cases, you have a legal right to be joined by your family. But in many
situations, you must show that you have the income to support them and satisfy
eligibility criteria. The information on this page is mostly about spouses,
partners and dependent children.
