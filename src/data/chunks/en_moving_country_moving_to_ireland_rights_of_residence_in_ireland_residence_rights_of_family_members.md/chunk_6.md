###  Parents of Irish citizen children

Parents of Irish citizen children can apply for residence. If the parent is
outside of Ireland, they may need a visa to come to Ireland.

To qualify for residence you must be the biological parent of an Irish citizen
child (and named on the child’s birth certificate) and you must be involved in
the child’s upbringing. The child must live in Ireland and be under 18.

If you already live in Ireland and have a valid immigration permission (for
example, you are in Ireland with a student visa or an employment permit), or
you have entered Ireland on a ‘D Reside Parent of an Irish citizen child’
visa, you should go to your local registration office with your child and
bring the following documents:

  * Your passport 
  * Your Irish Residence Permit (IRP) 
  * Your child’s Irish passport 
  * Your child’s birth certificate 
  * Proof of your address 
  * Proof of your child’s address 

If you are in Ireland and do not have immigration permission, or you came to
Ireland on a short stay visa, you must [ complete an application form

child-application-form.pdf) and post it with supporting documents to the
address noted in the form.
