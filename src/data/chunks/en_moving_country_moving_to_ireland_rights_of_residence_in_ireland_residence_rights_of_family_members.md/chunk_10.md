###  Qualifying and permitted family members

In EU law, there are 2 types of family member who can apply for a residence
card: qualifying family members and permitted family members.

The following are **qualifying family members** :

  * Your spouse or civil partner 
  * Your child or the child of your spouse under the age of 21 
  * Your grandchild or your spouseâ€™s grandchild under the age of 21 
  * Your dependent parent, or dependent parent of your spouse 
  * Your dependent grandparent, or the dependent grandparent of your spouse 
  * Other direct, dependent descendants or direct, dependent relatives in the ascending line (for example, great grandparents or great grandchildren) of either you or your spouse 

Children over 21 are generally considered qualifying family members if they
are in education, or are dependent on you due to an illness or disability. You
will have to show that your parents or grandparents (or the parents or
grandparents of your spouse) were dependent on you before they came to
Ireland.

**Permitted family members** include:

  * Your partner 
  * Any relative who is part of your household that is not a qualifying family member 
  * Any relative who needs your personal care because of illness or disability
