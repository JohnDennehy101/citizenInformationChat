##  Mistakes or errors on the summons

The court rarely dismisses a case because of an error or omission in a
summons. Differences between the facts on the summons and the facts presented
to the court by the prosecuting Garda about the time and place of the
incident, do not normally prevent the case from being prosecuted. In fact, the
District Court can amend a defective summons under [ Rule 38 of the District
Court Rules ](https://www.courts.ie/rules/miscellaneous-matters-si-
no-687-2005) .

However, a fundamental mistake on the summons, such as not including the
location of the District Court, or the identity of the District Court Clerk to
whom the complaint was made, means proceedings will not go ahead.
