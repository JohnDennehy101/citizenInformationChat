##  Introduction

A summons in criminal matters is a legal document that means you must attend
court on a particular date and time to answer a criminal accusation. Summonses
are also used in some private prosecutions.

Summonses are usually issued for less serious cases, where it is not
considered necessary to arrest you to guarantee that you appear in court. For
example, you will get a summons for most [ motoring offences ](/en/travel-and-
