###  Summons issued following applications from the Gardaí and other bodies

Under the Courts (No. 3) Act 1986 summons are issued by the District Court
following applications from the Attorney General, the Director of Public
Prosecutions, a member of the Garda Síochána or any other person statutorily
authorised to prosecute offences. This is the administrative procedure usually
used by the Gardaí to issue summons.
