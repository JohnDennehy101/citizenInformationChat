##  Service of the summons

There are [ certain rules ](https://www.courts.ie/rules/service-summons) about
how a summons can be served. They can be served by:

  * Personal delivery: by handing a copy of the summons to you, or by leaving it at your last known address or your place of work, or with your spouse, child or another relative 
  * Postal delivery: by registered post to your last or most usual place of residence or to your place of business or employment 

A summons must be served at least 7 days before the court date if it is served
by personal delivery, or 21 days before the court date if it is served by
postal delivery.

If a summons has not been correctly served, you are not obliged to appear in
court in response to it. However, if you come to court, the case against you
can proceed. In other words, any mistake in how the summons was served is
corrected by your appearance in court.
