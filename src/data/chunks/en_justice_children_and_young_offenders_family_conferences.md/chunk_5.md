##  Action plan

During the meeting, the child and their family meet privately to draft an
action plan that is designed to make amends and to help the child stay out of
trouble. The draft action plan is then discussed by the full group at the
meeting and agreed. If the group cannot agree on an action plan the court may
write their own or resume the court proceedings.

The agreed action plan is submitted to court for approval. The court can amend
the plan. If the court approves the plan it may be supervised by a probation
officer.

The court will set a date no more than 6 months later to review if the child
has completed the action plan. If the court rules that the plan is not
completed the court can deal with the case in some other way, for example [
detention ](/en/justice/children-and-young-offenders/detention-of-children/)
or [ community sanctions ](/en/justice/children-and-young-offenders/community-
sanctions-for-young-offenders/) . If the court is satisfied that the child has
completed the plan, it may dismiss the charge against the child.
