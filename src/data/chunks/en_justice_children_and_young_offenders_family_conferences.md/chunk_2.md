##  Introduction

When a [ child is charged with an offence ](/en/justice/children-and-young-
offenders/children-and-the-criminal-justice-system-in-ireland/) , the court
can order that a family conference be held. A family conference is a meeting
run by [ Young Persons Probation ](/en/justice/probation-and-welfare-
services/probation-service/) . The meeting includes the child charged with the
offence, members of the child’s family, the victim(s) and other relevant
people. At the meeting, everyone will talk about the offence and its effect on
the victim, the community and on the child’s family. The goal is to come up
with a plan that will help the child avoid getting into trouble in the future.

The legislation governing family conferences is the [ Children Act, 2001-2021
