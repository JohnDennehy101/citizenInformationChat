###  Compensation for victims of crime in other EU member states

If you are injured as a result of a crime while visiting another EU member
state, you may be entitled for compensation in the state where the incident
took place.

The European Commission [ provides an online portal
](https://e-justice.europa.eu/content_compensation-67-en.do) , which sets out
the compensation schemes available in EU member states. You should contact the
Criminal Injuries Compensation Tribunal for help with making your claim for
compensation (see ‘Where to apply’ below for contact details).

The Tribunal can help you get the application form that you need to make your
claim. It can also translate the form and your answers if the state you are
applying to does not accept applications in English. If you wish, the Tribunal
will also receive correspondence about your claim from the other member state
and pass it on to you.
