##  Compensation by court order

In some criminal cases, the court may decide that an offender must pay
compensation to you.

This may be one of several conditions that the court has imposed on the
offender so that they can avoid a [ prison sentence ](/en/justice/criminal-
law/criminal-trial/sentence/) . The court may ask the [ Probation Service
](/en/justice/probation-and-welfare-services/probation-service/) to supervise
the payment of the compensation.

Alternatively, [ you may bring a civil case ](/en/justice/civil-law/taking-
and-appealing-a-civil-case/) against the offender seeking a court order for
damages for any injury and loss caused.

You can seek compensation under both court order and by the Criminal Injuries
Compensation Scheme. However, you cannot be doubly compensated for any losses
you have suffered. If an application is made for a court order, the processing
of any application under the Scheme may be suspended until the outcome of the
court proceedings is known.
