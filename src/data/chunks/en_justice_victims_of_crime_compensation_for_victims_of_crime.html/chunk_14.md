###  2\. Personal injuries with long-term effects

In cases where longer term injuries have been experienced, you can, in
addition to the type of compensation listed at 1 above, also be paid for your:

  * Estimated future loss of earnings (if your injury restricts or fully prevents your future working) 
  * Estimated future medical expenses 
  * Estimated future expenses as a result of any disability suffered (such as future care or special equipment required) 
  * Estimated future loss of earning potential 

Typically, the Tribunal will only make such awards on provision of various
specialist reports, including an actuarial assessment.
