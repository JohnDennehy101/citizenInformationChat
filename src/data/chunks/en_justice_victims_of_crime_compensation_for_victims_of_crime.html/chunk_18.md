###  How is compensation paid?

Usually, it is paid in a single payment. However, there are exceptions:

  * The Tribunal may make an initial payment, typically in respect of vouched medical expenses, and postpone the final award until it becomes clearer what the long-term effect of an injury is likely to be. 
  * If you are under 18 years old, the Tribunal may invest the money until you become an adult. 
  * If you are no longer able to manage your affairs, the Tribunal may have the money placed in a trust for your benefit.
