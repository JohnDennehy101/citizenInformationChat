###  3\. Death of the victim due to criminal injury

Dependents can be paid for the:

  * Actual loss of earnings and expenses that may have been incurred before the death 
  * Future loss of support or maintenance for anyone who was dependent on the victim 
  * Costs of funeral and burial expenses 

In fatal cases, the Scheme also provides that an award (the maximum amount of
which cannot currently exceed €35,000) may be made under the Civil Liability
Act, 1961 in respect of mental distress experienced by dependents.

To avail of such compensation, applicants must declare all dependents as
defined in the 1961 Act and, for any dependent who wishes to waive their
entitlement to compensation, provide either a signed waiver (for those over
18) or an original birth certificate. The Tribunal will consider all
dependents in determining how to allocate the €35,000.
