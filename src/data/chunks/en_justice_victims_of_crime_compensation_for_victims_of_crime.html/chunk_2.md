##  Am I entitled to compensation?

As a victim of crime, you may be entitled to compensation under the [ Scheme
of Compensation for Personal Injuries Criminally Inflicted
](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/90be4-terms-and-conditions-of-the-
criminal-injuries-compensation-scheme/) (also known as “the Criminal Injuries
Compensation Scheme”).

The Scheme also provides for the dependents of a victim of a fatal criminal
injury to receive compensation. The Scheme is funded by the [ Department of
Justice ](https://www.gov.ie/en/organisation/department-of-justice/) and
administered by the [ Criminal Injuries Compensation Tribunal
](https://www.gov.ie/en/campaigns/0bff8-criminal-injuries-compensation-
scheme/) .

This page outlines the process of claiming compensation under the Criminal
Injuries Compensation Scheme. You can also seek compensation through the
courts. See ‘Compensation by court order’ below.
