##  What do I need to take the test?

Before applying to take a driving test, you need to make sure you are eligible
to be tested. To undergo driver testing in Ireland, you must:

  * **Complete all mandatory training** . For car tests, this means you will need to have completed all 12 [ Essential Driver Training (EDT) ](https://www.rsa.ie/en/RSA/Learner-Drivers/Driver-Training/Car-Training-EDT/) sessions with an RSA Approved Driving Instructor (ADI). You can [ access details of ADIs ](http://www.rsa.ie/en/RSA/Learner-Drivers/Finding-an-instructor/Find-an-instructor/) located across the country. Similarly, to sit a motorcycle test, you will need to have completed all the [ Initial Basic Training (IBT) ](https://www.rsa.ie/en/RSA/Learner-Drivers/Motorcyclists/Initial-basic-training-IBT-for-motorcyclists/) modules appropriate to [ the category of motorcycle ](https://www.rsa.ie/road-safety/road-users/motorcyclists/motorcycle) you wish to drive. You can read detailed information on these requirements in the RSA’s [ ‘Learning to Drive’ ](https://www.rsa.ie/services/learner-drivers/resources/documents) handbook. 
  * **Hold a learner permit** . You must hold [ a learner permit ](/en/travel-and-recreation/motoring/driver-licensing/learner-driving-permits-for-cars-and-work-vehicles/) appropriate to [ the category of vehicle ](/en/travel-and-recreation/motoring/driver-licensing/categories-of-motor-vehicles-and-minimum-age-of-drivers-in-ireland/) you wish to drive. In the case of cars, motorcycles and work vehicles, you generally cannot take a driving test [ for at least 6 months ](https://www.rsa.ie/en/RSA/Learner-Drivers/Safe-Driving1/6-Month-Rule/) after getting your first learner permit. However, there are [ exceptions to this rule ](https://www.rsa.ie/help-support/online-support-centre/details/learner-permits-driving-licences/learner-permits/reduced-edt---who-can-apply-and-how-to-apply) , notably for people who hold a full licence in a country (jurisdiction) with which Ireland does not have [ a licence exchange agreement ](https://www.rsa.ie/docs/default-source/services/s1.8-learner-driver-resources/reduced-edt-information-booklet.pdf?sfvrsn=db5fc51e_0) . 
  * **Have access to a representative vehicle** . The law requires that any person attending for a driving test presents with a vehicle that is representative of the [ Licensing Category ](https://www.rsa.ie/services/learner-drivers/faq/faqs-for-motorcycle-learner-drivers) in which they wish to attain a licence to drive. The RSA has published information on [ representative vehicles for the driving test (PDF) ](https://www.rsa.ie/docs/default-source/services/s1.5-driving-test/representative-vehicles-for-your-driving-test.pdf?sfvrsn=be90ac81_3) . Your vehicle must also be in order. Your vehicle must be roadworthy, displaying valid L-plates front and rear, valid insurance and motor tax discs, and valid original [ NCT disc ](/en/travel-and-recreation/vehicle-standards/national-car-test/) if applicable. You can get detailed information on vehicle requirements in RSA’s [ ‘Checklist for Your Driving Test’ ](https://www.rsa.ie/docs/default-source/services/s1.5-driving-test/checklist-for-your-driving-test.pdf?sfvrsn=3757eef2_7) publication.
