##  Apprenticeship fees

Generally, an apprentice does not pay fees. However, apprentices pay a pro-
rata registration fee (student contribution) if their off-the-job training
takes place within a college such as an Institute of Technology or
Technological University. The registration fee is generally based on the
amount of time the apprentice spends in the college. You can find information
about the pro-rata registration fee on apprenticeship.ie.
