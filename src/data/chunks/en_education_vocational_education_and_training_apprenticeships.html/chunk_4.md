###  **Craft apprenticeships**

A craft apprenticeship will generally last for 4 years, during which time you
will spend 3 different periods in off-the-job training.

Generally, you will start the first off-the-job training phase in an [
Education and Training Board (ETB) ](http://www.etbi.ie/etbs/directory-of-
etbs/) . Later, your off-the-job training will be in a Technological
University or [ Institute of Technology ](http://www.thea.ie/about-thea/) .

The skills you develop will be assessed through on-the-job competence testing
as well as off-the-job modular assessment and examinations. If you complete
these assessments successfully, you will be awarded an Advanced Certificate â€“
craft (level 6 on the [ National Framework of Qualifications
](http://www.qqi.ie/Articles/Pages/National-Framework-of-
Qualifications-\(NFQ\).aspx) ).

Craft apprenticeships include carpentry, plumbing, motor mechanics and
electrical apprenticeships.
