##  Apprenticeship wages and allowances

Rates of apprenticeship wages and allowances can vary depending on the type of
apprenticeship and the industry you have chosen:

  * **Apprenticeships developed before 2016** : While you are training on the job, your employer will pay you a recommended apprenticeship wage. The ETB pay a weekly allowance equivalent to that wage while you are training off the job. In some cases, the ETB will contribute to your travel and accommodation costs. You can get information about [ off-the-job training payments and allowances for craft apprentices ](https://apprenticeship.ie/news-events/news/off-the-job-training-payments-allowances-for-craft-apprentices) . 
  * **Apprenticeships developed from 2016** : Your employer will pay you for the duration of the apprenticeship. The rate of pay is agreed between you and your employer. 

**Annual leave:** Your [ statutory holiday entitlements
](/en/employment/employment-rights-and-conditions/leave-and-holidays/annual-
leave/) continue to accrue during the off-the-job phases, but must be taken
during the on-the-job phases at times agreed with your employer.

**Apprentices who have children:** [ Working Family Payment (WFP)
](/en/social-welfare/families-and-children/working-family-payment/) is a
weekly tax-free payment for employees with children. If you are an apprentice
and you have at least one child you may qualify for WFP, if you meet the
conditions for WFP.
