##  What is an apprenticeship?

An apprenticeship is how people are trained in a craft trade or profession.
You can get training in a traditional craft apprenticeship such as plumbing or
carpentry or a new apprenticeship such as accounting technician – see ‘Types
of apprenticeships’ below.

An apprenticeship programme provides on-the-job training with an employer
along with off-the-job training in an education centre. An apprenticeship can
last 2 to 4 years, during which time you will spend some time in off-the-job
training.

When you complete an apprenticeship programme, you will get a recognised
qualification at Level 5 or above on the NFQ framework.

You can start an apprenticeship from age 16 to 18 years depending on the
apprenticeship programme. There is no upper age limit.
