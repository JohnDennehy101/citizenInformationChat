##  Introduction

The new National Home Energy Upgrade Scheme provides grants to upgrade the
energy efficiency of your home. When the work is completed your home should
have an energy efficiency rating of B2 or above.

The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) administers the grants and
a private company manages the work for you. These companies are called [ One
Stop Shops ](https://www.seai.ie/grants/home-energy-grants/one-stop-shop/) ,
and the scheme is also known as the One Stop Shop Service.

The SEAI also provides [ individual energy upgrade grants
](/ga/housing/housing-grants-and-schemes/grants-for-home-renovations-and-
improvements/better-energy-homes-scheme/) , if you only want to do certain
home energy upgrades, and would prefer to manage the process yourself. There
is also a [ free home energy upgrade scheme ](/ga/housing/housing-grants-and-
schemes/grants-for-home-renovations-and-improvements/warmer-homes-scheme/) for
people on low incomes.
