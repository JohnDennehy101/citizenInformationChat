##  What is the presumption of paternity in family law?

In family law, _presumption of paternity_ means that children of parents who
are married are believed to be the children of the husband.

This means if the parents are married, the husband does not have to prove he
is the father of any children born in the marriage. This is unless there is
proof that he is not the father.

If a child is born more than 10 months after a couple separated, the
presumption that the husband is the father does not apply.
