##  Introduction

_Paternity_ simply means being the father of a child. Paternity and parentage
are not the same thing in legal terms.

  * Paternity is a statement, acknowledgement or proof of being a childâ€™s father. It is specifically about fatherhood or the status of being a father. 
  * Parentage is confirmation of a person being a child's mother or father. It is about parenthood or the status of being a parent.
