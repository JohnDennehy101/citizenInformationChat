###  If the alleged father disputes paternity

If the alleged father disputes that he is the father, he may agree to a
medical paternity test.

If he doesn't agree to this, the court (usually the [ District Court
](/en/justice/courts-system/district-court/) ) may direct that the alleged
father does a paternity test.

Where someone refuses to give a sample for a paternity test, the court can
draw whatever conclusion from the refusal. For example:

  * If the alleged father refuses to give a sample, the court may decide he is afraid the test will show he is the father. 
  * If the mother refuses to give a sample, the court may decide she is afraid the test will prove the named man is not the father.
