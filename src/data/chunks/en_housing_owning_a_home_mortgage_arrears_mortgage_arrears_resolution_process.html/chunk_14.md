##  Appeals and complaints

The appeals process is separate from the MARP. However, if you are refused an
alternative repayment arrangement, or you reject the arrangement being
offered, you must get 3 months before the lender can start repossession
proceedings – see 'Repossession proceedings' below. Even though you are now
outside the MARP, you can appeal the decision to the lender’s Appeals Board
under the CCMA if:

  * You are not willing to accept the alternative repayment arrangement being offered 
  * You are not offered an alternative arrangement 
  * You are classified as not co-operating 

The lender must allow you a reasonable period to consider submitting an
appeal. This must be at least 20 business days from the date you receive
notification of the ASU’s decision.

The Appeals Board is made up of 3 of the lender’s senior personnel who have
not yet been involved in your case. At least one member of the Appeals Board
must be independent of the management team and must not be involved in lending
matters.

There must be a written procedure for handling appeals, to include:

  * Only written appeals will be considered 
  * Appeals will be acknowledged in writing within 5 business days of being received 
  * The lender must give you the name of one or more people who will be your point of contact in relation to the complaint until the Appeals Board has ruled on it 

The appeal must be decided within 40 business days of being received. The
lender must write to you within 5 business days of this, to tell you the
decision of the Appeals Board and explain the terms of any offer being made.
The lender must also inform you of your right to refer the matter to the [
Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman ](https://www.fspo.ie/) and must
give you the Ombudsman’s contact details.

The lender must give you written updates on the progress of the appeal at
least every 20 business days.
