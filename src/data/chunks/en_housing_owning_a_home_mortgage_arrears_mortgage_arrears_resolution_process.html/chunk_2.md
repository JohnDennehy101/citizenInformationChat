##  Introduction

The Central Bank's [ Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears (CCMA) (pdf)
](https://www.centralbank.ie/docs/default-source/Regulation/consumer-
protection/other-codes-of-conduct/24-gns-4-2-7-2013-ccma.pdf?sfvrsn=4) sets
out the framework that lenders must use when dealing with borrowers in
mortgage arrears or in pre-arrears. It requires lenders to handle all such
cases sympathetically and positively, with the objective of helping people to
meet their mortgage obligations. The Central Bank has [ information explaining
the CCMA and how it works ](https://www.centralbank.ie/consumer-
hub/explainers/how-does-the-central-bank-protect-me-if-i-cant-pay-my-mortgage)
.

Under the CCMA, lenders must operate a Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process
(MARP) when dealing with arrears and pre-arrears customers. MARP and the other
CCMA protections must be followed even if your lender sells your mortgage to
an unregulated firm, as these protections remain with the loan.

The CCMA contains a detailed definition of what constitutes 'not co-operating'
with the lender and strong provisions on what happens if you are declared 'not
co-operating' – which can include immediate commencement of repossession
proceedings.

The 4 steps of the MARP are covered in detail below. They are:

  1. Communication 
  2. Financial information 
  3. Assessment 
  4. Resolution 

There is also an appeals process under the CCMA, but this is outside the MARP.
If these steps have been exhausted and the lender intends to repossess your
home, they must then follow the CCMA rules governing repossession proceedings
– see ‘Repossession’ below.
