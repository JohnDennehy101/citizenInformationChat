##  Resolution

When the assessment is complete, the lender must explore all options for [
alternative repayment arrangements ](/en/housing/owning-a-home/mortgage-
arrears/alternative-mortgage-repayment-arrangements/) .

These options may include:

  * Paying interest only, or interest and part of the capital, for a period 
  * Permanently or temporarily reducing the interest rate 
  * Deferring repayments (or part) for a period 
  * Extending the mortgage term 
  * Changing the type of mortgage 
  * Adding arrears and interest to the principal 
  * Equity participation (reduction of principal, with transfer of part of your equity) 
  * Warehousing part of the mortgage (including through a split mortgage) 
  * Reducing the principal 
  * A "deferred interest" or other voluntary scheme 

The lender may require you to change from an existing tracker mortgage to
another mortgage type if it concludes that none of the options that include
keeping your tracker are appropriate or sustainable for you. It may offer you
an alternative arrangement that requires you to change from your tracker
mortgage if you can afford the alternative arrangement and it is sustainable.
