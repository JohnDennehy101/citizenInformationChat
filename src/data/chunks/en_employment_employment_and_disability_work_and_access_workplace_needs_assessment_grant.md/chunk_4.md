##  Why do I need a workplace needs assessment?

A workplace needs assessment helps identify necessary adjustments to remove
barriers you may face while doing your job or returning to work.

The assessment can cover working at a business premises, at home, or from a
remote working location.

You must get a specialist to do the assessment.
