###  **Appeals**

Work and Access is an administrative scheme, so you have no right to appeal a
particular decision on your application.

If you are unhappy with the decision, you can ask to have your case reviewed
by another DSP officer who was not involved in the original decision.

Write to the Department of Social Protection within 21 days of the decision,
explaining why you think the decision is wrong and provide any proof you have
to support your argument.
