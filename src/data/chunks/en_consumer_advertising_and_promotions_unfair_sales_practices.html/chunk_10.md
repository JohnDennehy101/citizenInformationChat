##  Rules on aggressive practices

Consumer law bans traders from using aggressive commercial practices. A
practice is aggressive if harassment, coercion, or _undue influence_
(exploiting a position of power) is used and this is likely to:

  * Impair your freedom of choice 
  * Affect your buying decisions 

Aggressive commercial practices include:

  * Sales tactics that try to intimidate or coerce you 
  * The use of threatening or abusive language or behaviour 
  * Practices that try to take advantage of vulnerable consumers 
  * Imposing difficult or unreasonable non-contractual barriers when you want to end the contract or switch to another product or trader 
  * Threats to take legal action when the trader has no basis for such action
