##  Complain about sales practices

You can get advice and further help in our section on [ how to complain
](/en/consumer/how-to-complain/how-to-make-a-complaint/) .

If you believe that a trader has used unfair, misleading or aggressive or
blacklisted sales practices, you can report this to the CCPC. If the complaint
is about a financial service, you can report it to the Central Bank.

Both the CCPC and the Central Bank can use this information to inform their
compliance and enforcement roles. However, they do not intervene in individual
complaints.

You have the right to seek _redress_ if you have been treated unfairly. The
right to redress means the right to correct a situation if your consumer
rights have been breached.

There are different redress options open to you, includig taking legal action
against the trader.
