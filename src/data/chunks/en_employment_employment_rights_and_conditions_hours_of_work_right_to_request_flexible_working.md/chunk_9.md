###  **Extra information**

Your employer can also ask you for extra information they need to consider
your request.

They can ask for details of the person needing care (for example your child,
spouse, parent and so on).

For a child, they can ask for a copy of their birth certificate or certificate
of placement.

For someone needing significant care for a medical reason, they can ask for
details of:

  * Your relationship to the person 
  * The nature of the care needed 
  * Relevant evidence such as a medical certificate signed by a medical practitioner or other evidence your employer may reasonably require
