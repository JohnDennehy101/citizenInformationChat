###  **Notice of termination of your flexible work arrangement**

Before giving you a notice of termination, your employer must:

  * Tell you in writing of the proposal to end your arrangement 
  * Detail the reasons for termination 
  * Allow you 7 days after you get notice to make representations regarding the proposal 
  * Consider, objectively and fairly, any representations you make before making a final decision 

When you ‘make a representation’, you can mention any facts or reasons why you
think the arrangement should continue.

If your employer still decides to end your arrangement, they must give you a
written notice of termination. This must include the reasons for ending it and
the date you must return to your original working arrangement.

The return date must be at least 4 weeks from the date of the termination
notice (unless the arrangement's original end date is less than 4 weeks away).
