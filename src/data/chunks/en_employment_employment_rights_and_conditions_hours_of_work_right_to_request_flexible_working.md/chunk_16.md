##  Changing your flexible working arrangement

You and your employer have the option to change the arrangement after it has
been approved, either before or after it begins.

Changes to your flexible working must be agreed in writing. They could
include:

  * Postponing the arrangement and agreeing on a new start date 
  * Shortening or changing the length of the arrangement 
  * Changes details of the arrangement in a way you both agree to
