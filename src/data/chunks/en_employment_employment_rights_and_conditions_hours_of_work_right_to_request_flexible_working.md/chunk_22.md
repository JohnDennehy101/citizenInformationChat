##  Asking to return to your previous working arrangement

You can ask to return sooner to your original working arrangement. You should
do this in writing, setting out your reasons and the proposed new date.

Your employer must respond within 4 weeks, considering business needs and the
reasons for your request.

If your employer agrees for you to return sooner, they can suggest a different
date for returning to the original working arrangement.
