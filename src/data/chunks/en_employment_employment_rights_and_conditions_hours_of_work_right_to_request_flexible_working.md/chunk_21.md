###  **Termination for abuse of the arrangement**

You must use the flexible working arrangement for the reasons it was approved
in your request.

Your employer can terminate the arrangement (see process above) if they have
reasonable grounds to believe you are not using it for those reasons.

They must give you notice and allow you 7 days to make representations before
terminating the arrangement.
