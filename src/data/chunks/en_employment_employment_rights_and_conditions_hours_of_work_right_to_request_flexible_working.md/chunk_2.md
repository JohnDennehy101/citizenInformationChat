##  Introduction

Since 7 March 2024, you have a new right to request a flexible working
arrangement if you are a parent or carer.

You can request flexible working from your first day in a new job but you must
have 6 months of continuous service before the arrangement can start.

See ‘Who has the right to request flexible working?’ below.

This page summarises the duties and responsibilities set out in the [ WRC’s
Code of Practice

set out in the legislation.
