###  **Reasons your employer can terminate** **your** **arrangement**

Your employer may want to end the flexible working arrangement because of:

  * Seasonal changes in workload 
  * Unavailability of someone to do your job 
  * The nature of your job responsibilities 
  * The number of employees in the workplace 
  * Overlapping flexible working arrangements of employees 
  * Any other factors affecting the operation of their business 

Employers should make sure their reasons for termination are fair, objective,
and reasonable.
