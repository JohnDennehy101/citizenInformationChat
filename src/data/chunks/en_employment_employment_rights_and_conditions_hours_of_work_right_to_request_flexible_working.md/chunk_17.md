###  **If you get sick before starting the new arrangement**

Tell your employer if you get sick before your new arrangement begins and you
can no longer take care of the person covered under the flexible working
arrangement.

You should tell them in writing and include a medical certificate or other
proof that you cannot provide care for the person because you are sick.
