###  **What your employer should consider**

Your employer should consider your flexible working request based on:

  * Their own needs (the business needs) 
  * Your needs and reasons for the request 
  * The WRC Code of Practice 

Employers can also consider the guidance for remote working requests set out
in [ part 2 of the WRC Code of Practice
