##  Duties of the defence counsel

The defence counsel is the barrister who presents your case to the court. The
main duty of the defence counsel is to defend you whether or not they think or
believe you are guilty.

If you are the accused in a [ criminal trial ](/en/justice/criminal-
law/criminal-trial/criminal-trial/) , your defence counsel must behave
according to the following rules:

  * The defence counsel must prioritise a criminal case over all other matters. 
  * The defence counsel must be properly briefed – that is, they must have received all the relevant information relating to your case in adequate time before a trial begins. 
  * The decision whether or not to give [ evidence ](/en/justice/evidence/) is your decision and not your counsel's. 
  * The defence counsel has a duty to stay with you even if you are not accepting their advice. 
  * The defence counsel should always be present during the trial. However, if they have to leave due to unforeseen circumstances, they must make sure that you are not left unrepresented, and they must obtain the consent of your solicitor to be absent. 
  * Where there are 2 defence counsel, neither may leave the trial except temporarily and for good reason. 
  * The defence counsel cannot withdraw from your case because of any conduct or remarks made by the trial judge, unless it is in your best interests. 
  * If you are in custody, the defence counsel must get the court’s permission before withdrawing. 
  * If you flee, your legal representation may withdraw from the case. 
  * If you are [ convicted ](/en/justice/criminal-law/criminal-trial/sentence/) , the defence counsel has a duty to see you and to appear for you in any appeal unless they have advised against the appeal.
