##  Help with paying for legal representation

If you have been accused of a crime and cannot afford legal representation,
you may apply to get [ criminal legal aid ](/en/justice/legal-aid-and-
advice/criminal-legal-aid/) from the State.

You apply for criminal legal aid in court. If a judge grants you legal aid,
you will be issued with a [ legal aid certificate ](/en/justice/legal-aid-and-
advice/criminal-legal-aid-certificates/) to cover any costs associated with
preparing your defence and going to court.

You can read more about criminal legal aid on the websites of the [ Department
of Justice ](https://www.gov.ie/ga/foilsiuchan/63e826-criminal-legal-
aidadvice/) , [ the Law Society ](https://www.lawsociety.ie/Public/Legal-
guides/Legal-aid/Criminal-legal-aid) , and the [ Legal Aid Board
](https://www.legalaidboard.ie/en/our-services/criminal-legal-aid/) (which
does not provide criminal legal aid).
