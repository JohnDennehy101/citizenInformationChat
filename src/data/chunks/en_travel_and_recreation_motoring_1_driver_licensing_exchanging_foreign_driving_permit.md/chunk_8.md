###  Ukrainian licence

You can drive on your Ukrainian driving licence while in Ireland under
temporary protection. You can no longer exchange it for an Irish driving
licence. If you have already exchanged your Ukrainian driving licence for an
Irish licence, you can request to have it returned to you, or continue to
drive on your Irish licence for one year from the date it was issued.
