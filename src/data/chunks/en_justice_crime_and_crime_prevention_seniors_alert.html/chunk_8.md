###  What groups can register as providers of the scheme?

Community, voluntary and not-for-profit organisations can apply to register
with Pobal for the scheme. They must have a recognised structure and be able
to show that they can manage the grants. They must also have a record of
working with older people in the community.

A group will not be able to register if there is an existing group operating
the scheme in the area.
