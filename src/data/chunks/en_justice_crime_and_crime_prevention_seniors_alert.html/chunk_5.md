##  What type of equipment can I get?

Funding is available to buy and install monitored personal alarms, which can
be worn as a pendant or around your wrist like a watch. These alarms connect
to a national helpline through a base unit installed in your home.

When the alarm is activated, it automatically rings the helpline, which is
open 24 hours a day all year round. A helpline operator talks to you in your
home and decides whether to alert a local volunteer responder or, if
necessary, the emergency services.

Equipment supplied under the scheme remains the property of the registered
group and must be returned to the group if no longer needed.
