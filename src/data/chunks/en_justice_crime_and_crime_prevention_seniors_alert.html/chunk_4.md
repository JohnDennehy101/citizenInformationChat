###  Costs

All equipment and installation under the scheme is free. The alarm monitoring
service is free for the first year. After the first year, you will be asked to
pay the annual monitoring fee.

The annual monitoring fee will vary by service provider and the type of alarm
or pendant supplied. Your local group can tell you about the cost in advance.

If there is no suitable landline available in your home and a mobile signal is
used to connect to the equipment, you may have to pay a fee for mobile SIM
rental.
