###  How do I get the equipment?

You must contact a community or voluntary group registered in your area.

The registered community or voluntary group will:

  * Assess your eligibility for the scheme and complete the application form with you 
  * Identify the equipment required and get quotations from suppliers 
  * Submit the application and supporting documentation to Pobal 

You will be asked to confirm that you understand the purpose and use of the
equipment and that you will be responsible for the annual monitoring fee after
the first year.
