####  **Did you get a letter requesting you to attend an oral hearing?**

In some cases, the Appeals Officer may wish to talk with you before they make
a decision. In this case, you will be invited to attend an oral hearing.

Don't worry - an oral hearing is a good opportunity for the Appeals Officer to
get to know your case in more detail. You can bring a representative, for
example a friend or trade union official, to the hearing with you for support
or assistance.
