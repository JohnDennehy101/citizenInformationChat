####  **You will be given a decision on your case**

If you attended an oral hearing, you should get a decision on your case within
2 or 3 weeks.

The Appeals Officer will write to both you and the Department of Social
Protection to tell you their decision and the reasons for it. If your appeal
is not successful, the Appeals Officer will explain why.
