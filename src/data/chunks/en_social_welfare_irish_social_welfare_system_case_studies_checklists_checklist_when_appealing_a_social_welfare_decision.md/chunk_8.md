####  **Why do you not agree with the Department of Social Protection's
decision?**

In your appeal you must:

  * State why you think the decision was not correct 
  * Include copies of any evidence and documents you want to be considered (you should keep your original documents) 
  * Enclose a copy of the letter you got from the Deciding Officer or Designated Person that informed you of the decision 

You should arrange your documents in date order and if using photocopies of
original documents, make sure they are legible.
