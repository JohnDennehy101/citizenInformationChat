####  **If your appeal is unsuccessful**

Generally, an Appeals Officer's decision is final.

However, a decision can be revised in the following circumstances:

  * An Appeals Officer may revise their decision if new evidence or facts, or any relevant change of circumstances, comes to light after a decision is made 
  * The Chief Appeals Officer may revise an Appeals Officerâ€™s decision if a mistake was made in relation to the law or facts of the case 

In either case, you must submit a written statement explaining why you are
seeking a review.

You may also seek a judicial review of the Appeals Officer's decision in the
Courts, but only on a point of law.

The [ Office of the Ombudsman
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/government-in-ireland/how-government-
works/standards-and-accountability/office-of-the-ombudsman/) can also examine
complaints about the actions and everyday administrative activities of the
Social Welfare Appeals Office.
