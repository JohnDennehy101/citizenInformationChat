####  **Did you take note of the date, time and location of the hearing?**

Be sure to arrive on time to your hearing. Appeal hearings are non-
confrontational. The Appeals Officer is there to listen to your point of view
and will make a fair decision.

If you cannot make the oral hearing, contact the Social Welfare Appeals Office
as soon as possible so a change of date can be arranged.
