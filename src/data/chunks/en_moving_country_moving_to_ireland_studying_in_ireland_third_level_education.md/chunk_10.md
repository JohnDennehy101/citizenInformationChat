###  Recognition of qualifications from other countries

If you have taken your secondary school exams under another system in another
country, you will need to check whether your qualifications will be sufficient
to secure a place in the Irish third-level course of your choice. You can do
this through the [ Qualifications Recognition Service
](http://qsearch.qqi.ie/WebPart/Search?searchtype=recognitions) . You should
then contact the college directly to confirm this before making your
application.
