###  English language requirements

English is the language of instruction at all third-level colleges in Ireland
(some colleges also instruct in the Irish language) so you will need to show
that you are proficient in the language before you will be accepted on a
course. Collegesâ€™ requirements differ but generally they look for an
acceptable English language proficiency test, for example the [ TOEFL
](http://www.ets.org/toefl/) or equivalent. You may be able to take English
courses at the college of your choice, but if these are not available there
are a number of private English language colleges around the country.
