**Non-EEA students**

Non-EEA nationals coming to study in Ireland must be enrolled in an eligible
full-time course listed on the [ Interim List of Eligible Programmes (ILEP)
](https://www.irishimmigration.ie/coming-to-study-in-ireland/frequently-asked-
questions-for-students/) for student immigration purposes. You can find out
more in our document on [ the immigration rules for non-EEA students.
](/en/moving-country/moving-to-ireland/studying-in-ireland/immigration-nonEEA-
students/)

If you are travelling from a country that requires a visa to enter Ireland,
you need to apply for a [ student visa ](/en/moving-country/visas-for-
ireland/student-visas/) . If you are not required to have a visa to enter
Ireland, you do not need a student visa to study in Ireland but you should
have your letter of offer of a place at the school, or educational institution
and your other documentation ready for inspection at immigration.

All non-EEA students must [ register with their local immigration officer to
get permission to remain in Ireland. ](/en/moving-country/moving-to-
ireland/rights-of-residence-in-ireland/registration-of-non-eea-nationals-in-
ireland/) The website of the Immigration Service Delivery (ISD) has details of
what evidence is required. Non-EEA students coming to Ireland for the first
time may not get permission to remain in Ireland if they have their children
with them, or intend their children to join them later on. [ There is more
information about the children of non-EEA students on the ISD website (pdf).
