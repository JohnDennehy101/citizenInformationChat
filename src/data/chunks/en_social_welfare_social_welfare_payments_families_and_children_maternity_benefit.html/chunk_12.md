###  Stillbirth

From 16 September 2024, if your baby has a gestational age of not less than 23
weeks (or if your baby weighs not less than 400 grams), and they show no sign
of life at birth, this is called a [ stillbirth ](/en/birth-family-
relationships/miscarriage-and-stillbirth/bereavement-and-childbirth/) .

If you have a stillbirth you are entitled to 26 weeks of [ maternity leave
](/en/employment/employment-rights-and-conditions/leave-and-
holidays/maternity-leave/) .

You are also entitled to 26 weeks of Maternity Benefit, provided you meet the
social insurance (PRSI) contributions.

To apply for Maternity Benefit following a stillbirth, you need to send a
letter from your doctor with the Maternity Benefit application form,
confirming the expected date of birth, the actual date of birth, the number of
weeks gestation and the birth weight of the baby.
