###  Going back to work

You can do voluntary work, public representative work (for example, a
councillor or TD) and courses of education while you are getting Maternity
Benefit. However, your payment will be stopped if you engage in insurable
(paid) employment.

If you intend to return to employment earlier than you stated on your
application form, you must notify the Maternity Benefit Section at least 2
weeks before your new 'return to work date'.
