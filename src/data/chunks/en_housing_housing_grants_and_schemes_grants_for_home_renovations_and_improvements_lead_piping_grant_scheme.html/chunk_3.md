##  Can I get a grant to replace my lead pipes?

To qualify for the [ Domestic Lead Remediation Grant
](https://www.gov.ie/en/service/6e885-domestic-lead-remediation-grant-scheme/)
, the lead pipes and fittings being replaced must be part of a system that
carries water for preparing food or drinks, or for direct human consumption.

You must live in the property as your normal place of residence. If you rent
the property, you must have the ownerâ€™s permission to get the work done. You
will not qualify for the grant if the property is:

  * A private holiday home 
  * A commercial property, for example, a short-term holiday home or self-catering property 
  * Owned by a local authority, approved housing body or the Health Service Executive 

There was previously a means test for the grant, but this was scrapped on 1
December 2022.
