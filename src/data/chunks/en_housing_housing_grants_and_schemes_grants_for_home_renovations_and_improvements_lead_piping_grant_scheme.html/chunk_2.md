##  Introduction

[ Lead in drinking water ](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/d70c0-lead-in-
drinking-water/?referrer=http://www.housing.gov.ie/water/water-quality/lead-
drinking-water) is a danger to peopleâ€™s health, especially for young children,
pregnant women and babies fed on formula. The World Health Organisation (WHO)
and the Health Service Executive (HSE) advise that there is no safe level of
lead in drinking water. Lead was commonly used in plumbing systems in Ireland
up to and including the 1970s, so some people may still be getting water
through these systems. The most effective way to reduce your exposure to lead
in drinking water is to replace lead piping.

A grant is available to help people with the cost of replacing lead piping in
their homes. The Domestic Lead Remediation Grant Scheme was introduced in 2016
and was updated by the [ Housing (Domestic Lead Remediation Grant) Regulations
2022. ](https://assets.gov.ie/237467/2a7a5d03-bf81-4527-a726-c5c81d79dc2d.pdf)
The Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage has general
information about the scheme in their [ customer leaflet
