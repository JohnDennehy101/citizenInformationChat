##  Introduction

When you apply for Jobseeker's Allowance, your [ means ](/en/social-
welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/means-test-for-social-welfare-
payments/means-test/) are assessed to see whether you will qualify. If you are
24 years of age or under and you are living with a parent or a step-parent in
the family home, your parents' income is also taken into account. The
Department of Social Protection call this an assessment of the _benefit and
privilege_ you get from living with your parents.

This means, while you may have no income, your parents' income can affect your
social welfare payment. If however your only means are from the benefit of
your parents' income and those means are **less** than the personal rate of
Jobseeker's Allowance, the minimum weekly payment you are entitled to is â‚¬40.

Some people may still refer to _benefit and privilege_ as 'board and
lodgings'.
