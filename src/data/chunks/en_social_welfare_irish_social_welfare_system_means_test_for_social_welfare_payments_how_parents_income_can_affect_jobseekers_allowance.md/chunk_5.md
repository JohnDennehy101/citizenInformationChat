##  An example showing how to calculate benefit and privilege

Example 1

A one-parent family with 4 children. Two of the children are still in school,
one child in an apprenticeship and the claimant (The claimant is 24 years of
age and applying for Jobseeker's Allowance).

Parent’s net weekly income €590  
Less deductions from net income ***** €630  
Total -€40

***** Less weekly mortgage repayments of €100 and weekly disregard for
children of €60 (€30 x 2 children) and one-parent standard weekly allowance of
€470 (€100 + €60 + €470 = €630).

In this case, parental income of €590 is less than the total amount of
deductions, which is €630. Therefore, parental income is assessed as NIL and
will not affect the Jobseeker's Allowance claim.

Example 2

If we take the same situation of a one-parent family with 4 children. Two of
the children are still in school, one child in an apprenticeship and the
fourth is the claimant (who is 24 years of age and applying for Jobseeker's
Allowance). If we increase the parent's income to €800 per week, benefit and
privilege is calculated as follows:

Parent’s net weekly income €800  
Less deductions from net income* €630  
Total €170

***** Less weekly mortgage repayments of €100 and weekly disregard for
children of €60 (€30 x 2 children) and one-parent standard weekly allowance of
€470 (€100 + €60 + €470 = €630).

34% of the above total of €170 = €58 (rounded up from €57.80)

Maximum weekly Jobseeker's Allowance payment €141.70 less €58 = €83.70 (see
'Note' below)

**Amount of Jobseeker's Allowance payable to claimant = €83.70**

**Note:** People under 25 get an age-related rate of Jobseeker's Allowance.
More information on the JA rates for people under 25 can be found in our page
