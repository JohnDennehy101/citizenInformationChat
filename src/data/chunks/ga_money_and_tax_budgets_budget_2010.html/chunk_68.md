###  Student grants and scholarships

From January 2010 the rates of student grants and scholarships will be reduced
by 5%. It will apply to all existing and new grant-holders.

From 2010 people in receipt of the Back to Education Allowance and the VTOS
allowances for those pursuing a Post-Leaving Certificate course will not be
eligible for student support grants but they will not have to pay the student
service charge or college fees. This will apply to all new grant-holders in
2010 onwards.

Support under the Millennium Partnership Fund is being withdrawn saving â‚¬2m.
