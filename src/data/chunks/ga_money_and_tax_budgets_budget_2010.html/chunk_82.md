###  Salaries

Public service salaries will be reduced as follows:

**Salaries less than €125,00 per year**

  * 5% on the first €30,000 of salary 
  * 7.5% on the next €40,000 of salary 
  * 10% on the next €55,000 of salary 

This produces overall reductions in salaries ranging from 5% to just under 8%
for salaries up to €125,000.

**Salaries more than €125,00 per year**

  * 8% on salaries of up to €165,000 
  * 12% on salaries up to €200,000 
  * 15% on salaries of €200,000 or more. 

These reductions are in line with the recommendations of a recent report of
the Review Body on Higher Remuneration.

The salaries of Ministers and Secretaries General of Government departments
will be reduced by 15%. The Taoiseach’s salary will be reduced by 20%.

There will be further reductions in fees paid by State bodies for professional
services. There will also be savings from general reductions in grants and
grants-in-aid paid by departments.
