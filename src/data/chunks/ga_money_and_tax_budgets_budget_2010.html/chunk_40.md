###  Capital programme

Multi-annual funding for the mental health capital programme is to be provided
from the sale of HSE assets. In 2010 the HSE will invest an initial sum of €43
million in the programme.

The mental health capital programme will provide a range of facilities across
the entire spectrum of mental healthcare facilities including acute
psychiatric units, child and adolescent units, day hospitals, community
nursing units and high support hostels, and will provide the infrastructure
necessary to enable its transformation into a patient-centred, flexible and
community-based mental health service, where the need for hospital admission
is reduced, whilst still providing in-patient care when appropriate.

Provision for continued funding of the programme will be made in the 2011
Estimates and subsequent years, in the light of the previous year’s programme
of asset sales.
