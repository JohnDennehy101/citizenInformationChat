##  What is the Free Travel Scheme?

The [ Free Travel Scheme ](https://www.gov.ie/en/service/9bba61-free-travel-
scheme/) allows you to travel, free of charge, on public transport and some
private bus and ferry services.

Everyone aged 66 and over, living permanently in Ireland, can get the Free
Travel Scheme.

People with disabilities and carers aged under 66 may also qualify for Free
Travel.

If you qualify for Free Travel and you are married, in a civil partnership or
cohabiting, your partner may travel with you for free if you meet certain
criteria (see ‘Spouses, civil partners and cohabitants’ below).

If you can’t travel alone for medical reasons, you may get Free Travel for a
companion. This allows a person aged over 16 to travel with you for free.
