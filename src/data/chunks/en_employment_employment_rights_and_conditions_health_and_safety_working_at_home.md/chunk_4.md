##  Can I continue to work from home?

You do not have a right to work from home. Once the new legislation is
commenced you will have a legal right to request remote working but it will be
up to your employer to agree to the request.

**Check what your contract says**

Your employment rights are primarily set out in your [ contract of employment
](/en/employment/employment-rights-and-conditions/contracts-of-
employment/contract-of-employment/) . Some employees may have already written
into their contract of employment that they can work from home for a number of
hours or days per week. Those entitlements will remain the same.
