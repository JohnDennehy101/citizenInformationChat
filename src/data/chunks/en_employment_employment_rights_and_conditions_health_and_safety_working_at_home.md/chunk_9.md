##  Remote working hubs

Remote working hubs are offices where you can book a desk and work remotely,
alongside other people. Itâ€™s also called hot-desking. You might prefer to work
in a hub if your own home is not suitable for work.

You can register for hot-desk working days with [ connectedhubs.ie
