##  E-working and tax relief

If you are working from home, you may be eligible for tax relief on expenses
like light, heat, telephone and broadband.

**If your employer pays you an allowance** towards these expenses, you can get
up to €3.20 per day without paying any tax, PRSI or USC on it. If your
employer pays more than €3.20 per day to cover expenses, you pay tax, PRSI and
USC as normal on the amount above €3.20.

**If your employer does not pay you an allowance** for your expenses, you can
claim for tax relief at the end of the year. You will get money back from the
taxes you paid. Since January 2022, you can claim remote working relief for
30% of the cost of heating, electricity and broadband for days spent working
from home.
