##  Employee responsibilities

If you are working from home, you have a responsibility to take reasonable
care of yourself and other people who may be affected by the work you are
doing.

You must:

  * Cooperate with your employer and follow their instructions 
  * Protect yourself and others from harm during your work. For example, you must take care of your equipment and report any problems immediately to your employer 
  * Report injuries to your employer immediately 
  * Follow any procedures put in place by your employer, for example, around checking in regularly 
  * Make sure you manage your own working time (see 'right to disconnect' below) 

You should:

  * Agree on temporary remote working arrangements with your employer, including regular communication with them 
  * Identify the work to be done at home with your employer 
  * Identify the equipment you need to set up a safe workspace at home and agree this with your employer 
  * Identify a suitable safe space within your home for home working 
  * Agree on plans and contacts to be used in the event of an emergency 
  * Ensure you have a suitable workspace – See [ good positioning at your workstation (pdf) ](https://www.besmart.ie/fs/doc/handout_cutout_for_web.pdf)

You have a **right to disconnect** from work outside of your usual working
hours. This means you have the right to switch off and not respond immediately
to work-related emails, calls or messages outside of usual work times.
Similarly, you should respect your colleagues’ right to disconnect from their
work too. Read about [ the Code of Practice on the Right to Disconnect (pdf)
](https://www.workplacerelations.ie/en/what_you_should_know/codes_practice/code-
of-practice-for-employers-and-employees-on-the-right-to-disconnect.pdf) in the
WRC handbook.

People working from home may feel reluctant to tell their employer that they
are unwell. It is important to note that if you are feeling unwell the normal
[ sick leave rules ](/en/employment/employment-rights-and-conditions/leave-
and-holidays/sick-leave-and-sick-pay/) still apply.
