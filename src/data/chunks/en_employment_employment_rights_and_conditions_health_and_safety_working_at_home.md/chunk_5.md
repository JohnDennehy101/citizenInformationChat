##  Employers' duties

Employers have specific duties to ensure the [ safety, health and welfare at
work ](/en/employment/employment-rights-and-conditions/health-and-
safety/health-safety-work/) of all their employees. These duties include the
employeeâ€™s workspace if employees work from home. Key duties include:

  * Managing and conducting all work activities to ensure, as far as reasonably practicable, the safety, health and welfare of employees 
  * Providing safe work that is planned, organised, and maintained 
  * Assessing risks and implementing appropriate control measures 
  * Providing safe equipment including personal protective equipment, where necessary 
  * Giving information, instruction, training and supervision about safety and health to employees 
  * Having plans in place for emergencies 

If employees have a disability, are young workers or are pregnant, employers
need to ensure that the tasks and working conditions do not adversely affect
their health. You can get more information on [ sensitive risk groups
](https://www.hsa.ie/eng/Workplace_Health/Sensitive_Risk_Groups/) .

Your employer should check with you to ensure:

  * You are aware of any specific risks when working from home 
  * The work activity and the temporary workspace are suitable 
  * You have suitable equipment to do the work. For example, your employer should make sure that the applications and systems you need are installed on your computer 
  * There is a pre-arranged means of contact
