###  The right to disconnect from work

As well as making sure your employee takes adequate breaks, you should also
respect their right to disconnect from work outside of normal working hours.

The [ Code of Practice on the Right to Disconnect (pdf)
](https://www.workplacerelations.ie/en/what_you_should_know/codes_practice/code-
of-practice-for-employers-and-employees-on-the-right-to-disconnect.pdf) is
effective since 1 April 2021 and applies to all employees, including people
working from home. Developed by the WRC, the Code of Practice provides
guidance on an employee’s right to disengage from work outside normal working
hours.

Under the code, the right to disconnect has the following main elements:

  * A right not to have to routinely work outside normal working hours 
  * A right not to be penalised for refusing to work outside normal hours 
  * A duty to respect another person’s right to disconnect, for example by not routinely emailing or calling outside normal working hours 

As an employer, you are encouraged to develop a ‘Right to Disconnect Policy’.
Consult your employees when developing this policy, and make sure they
understand what their normal working hours are.

Check that the policy factors in health and safety legislation, as well as
your employees’ terms and conditions of employment. You should communicate
this policy to all employees, unions and any other employee representatives.

You can find a [ template of a ‘Right to Disconnect Policy’ (pdf)
](https://www.workplacerelations.ie/en/what_you_should_know/codes_practice/code-
of-practice-for-employers-and-employees-on-the-right-to-disconnect.pdf) on
page 11 of the WRC handbook.

While failure to follow the code is not an offence, it can be used as evidence
in a case taken to the Labour Court or WRC under employment legislation.
