###  Equipment and your workspace at home

If your employer provides equipment, for example, a laptop, mouse, keyboard
and headset it must be in good condition and suitable for the activity. If you
already have suitable equipment at home, it can be used temporarily.

Employers must check that your temporary home workspace is suitable for the
work. This includes things like safe access to the space, essential equipment,
that the space is big enough and free of clutter, there is adequate lighting,
ventilation and heat, and that electrical sockets, plugs and cords are in good
condition.

ergonomics on the HSA website.

Employers need to communicate regularly with employees and ensure that
employees are taking adequate breaks.

Employers should also:

  * Keep in contact with employees 
  * Give regular updates to each employee 
  * Have emergency contacts and procedures in place 
  * Ensure employees take adequate breaks – see our document on [ rest periods and breaks. ](/en/employment/employment-rights-and-conditions/hours-of-work/work-breaks-and-rest-periods/)

Even though you are working from home you should have the same access to
training and promotion opportunities as comparable colleagues working in the
office.
