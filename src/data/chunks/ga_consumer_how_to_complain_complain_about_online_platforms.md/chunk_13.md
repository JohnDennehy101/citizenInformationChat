##  Concerns about targeted ads

Online platforms must:

  * Mark ads so you know you are seeing an ad 
  * Give you information on who is presenting the ad and who paid for it (if different) 
  * Give you reasons you were targeted for an ad and information on how you can change these settings 

Ads must not target certain personal data, including race, ethnic origin,
political opinion, membership in a trade union, religious or philosophical
beliefs, health data, your sex life, or sexual orientation.
