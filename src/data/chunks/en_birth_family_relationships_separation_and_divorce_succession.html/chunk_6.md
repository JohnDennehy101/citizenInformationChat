##  Can I apply for a share of my former spouse’s estate?

As a divorced spouse, or a civil partner whose civil partnership has been
dissolved, you can apply to the court for a share of your former spouse’s
estate if:

  * You apply within 6 months of the [ Grant of Probate or Administration ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/death/the-deceaseds-estate/dealing-with-the-deceaseds-estate/)
  * You have not remarried 

Your application will only be successful if the court finds that you were not
properly provided for in the divorce or dissolution. Often during divorce or
dissolution proceedings, the court will make an order which bars you from
making this type of application.
