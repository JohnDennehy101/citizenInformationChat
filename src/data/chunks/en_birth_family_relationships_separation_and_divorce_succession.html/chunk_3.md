##  Succession rights after a separation

When you legally separate from your spouse or civil partner, you can choose to
give up your succession rights.

If you and your spouse have a formal [ separation agreement
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/birth-family-relationships/separation-
and-divorce/separation-agreement/) , you may have already given up your
succession rights.

If the court granted you a decree of [ judicial separation
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/birth-family-relationships/separation-
and-divorce/judicial-separation/) , it may have made an order to say your
succession rights have ended.

The court will only renounce (give up) your succession rights if it is
satisfied that you will be properly provided for.
