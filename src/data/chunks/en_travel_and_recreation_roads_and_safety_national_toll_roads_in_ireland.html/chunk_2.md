##  Introduction

Toll roads are roads that drivers must pay to use.

Many major new road developments are funded through _public private
partnerships_ . This means that the funding for the building **and**
maintenance of the road comes from the Irish State and private businesses.

These private businesses charge money for vehicles to use the roads they have
helped to build, and the charging is carried out through tolling.

[ Transport Infrastructure Ireland (TII) ](http://www.tii.ie/) oversees the
implementation of tolling in Ireland. TII is responsible for planning,
supervising constructing and maintaining all national roads.

TII can charge and collect tolls from vehicles under the [ Roads Act 1993
](http://revisedacts.lawreform.ie/eli/1993/act/14/revised/en/html) . For a new
toll charge to be introduced, bye-laws must be introduced.

The registered owner of a vehicle is legally responsible for paying the toll,
which means that you may be fined or prosecuted for not paying a toll, even if
you were not driving the vehicle.
