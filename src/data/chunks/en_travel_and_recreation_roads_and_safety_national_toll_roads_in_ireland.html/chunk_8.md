###  Electronic tolling (eTolls)

Electronic tolling uses a small electronic tag that is placed in the vehicle
and is detected each time your vehicle passes through the toll. The toll is
then debited against the customer's account. The electronic tolling system
automatically recognises the correct toll for the class of vehicle you are
driving.

There are several companies providing electronic tags to motorists. All these
providers use the same system, which means you only need one tag for all
tolling facilities. Information on suppliers of electronic tags and the
different types of tag accounts is available at [ etoll.ie
