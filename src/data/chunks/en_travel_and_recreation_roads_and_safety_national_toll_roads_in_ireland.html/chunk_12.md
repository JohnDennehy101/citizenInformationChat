###  Criminal procedure

You can be charged with an offence for not paying your toll or not obeying the
instruction of a person authorised to manage and operate a toll road. The
penalty on [ summary conviction ](/en/justice/criminal-law/criminal-
trial/fines-for-criminal-offences/) is a fine of up to â‚¬5,000 or a term of
imprisonment of up to 6 months, or both.

On the M50, the bye-laws set out penalties for those who fail, refuse or
neglect to pay toll fees. The penalty charge will increase after a certain
number of days if you do not pay. You can [ get more information about these
charges from TII ](https://www.tii.ie/roads-tolling/tolling-information/toll-
