##  New toll road schemes

Each time a toll scheme is proposed for a road, TII must:

  * Publish a public notice informing citizens in the area about the proposed road 
  * Produce a _Draft Toll Scheme_ that must be available for one month 
  * Serve a notice to the local authorities in the area where the toll road will be located 

Objections to the scheme must be made in writing on or before the specified
date.

The Draft Toll Scheme for a particular road and its accompanying _Explanatory
Statement_ will be prepared under the statutory provisions of the [ Roads Act
1993 ](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1993/en/act/pub/0014/index.html) , as
amended by the [ Planning and Development Act 2000
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2000/en/act/pub/0030/index.html) .

If objections to the Draft Toll Scheme are received and not withdrawn, TII
will arrange an oral hearing. The report and recommendations of the person
appointed to hold the hearing will be considered by the Board of TII before
deciding whether to adopt the Draft Toll Scheme.

TII may adopt the Draft Toll Scheme with or without modifications or may
refuse to adopt it.

The decision of TII on the Toll Scheme proposal will be published.
