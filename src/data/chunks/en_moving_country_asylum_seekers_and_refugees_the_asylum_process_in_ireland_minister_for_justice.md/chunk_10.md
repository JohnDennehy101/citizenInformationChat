###  Detentions under the International Protection Act

You can be arrested and detained pending deportation where an immigration
officer or a member of An Garda Síochána, with reasonable cause, suspects that
you have a deportation order and you:

  * Have failed to comply with any provision of the order or with a requirement 
  * Intend to leave the State and enter another state illegally 
  * Have destroyed identity documents or is in possession of forged identity documents 
  * Intend to avoid deportation 

For the purposes of making an arrest, the officer may enter (using reasonable
force if necessary) and search any premises where the person is or where the
officer suspects the person is. If it is a place where people live, the
officer cannot enter without consent unless you are ordinarily resident there
or the officer has reasonable grounds for believing you are there.
