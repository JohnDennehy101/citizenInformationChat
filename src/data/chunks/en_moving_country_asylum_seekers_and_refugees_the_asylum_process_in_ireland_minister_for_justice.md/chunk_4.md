###  If the IPO or IPAT recommends you should be granted international
protection

If the IPO (or IPAT) recommend that you be declared a refugee or that you
should be granted subsidiary protection, the Minister usually issues a
decision based on this recommendation. The Minister can still refuse to grant
you a refugee declaration if:

  * There are reasonable grounds for regarding you as a danger to the security of Ireland 
  * You have been convicted (either in Ireland or another country) of a serious crime and you constitute a danger to the community 
  * Your application for international protection was [ withdrawn ](/en/moving-country/asylum-seekers-and-refugees/the-asylum-process-in-ireland/withdrawing-from-the-asylum-process-in-ireland/)

If the Minister refuses your application for these reasons, you cannot appeal
this decision to IPAT. You may be able to apply to the High Court for a
judicial review of the decision. You should get legal advice about this.

When you get a decision from the Minister that declares you are a refugee or
have subsidiary protection, you must [ register and get an Irish Residence
Permit ](/en/moving-country/moving-to-ireland/rights-of-residence-in-
ireland/registration-of-non-eea-nationals-in-ireland/) . You can read about
the [ rights you have as a person with refugee or subsidiary protection status

remain/your-rights-when-you-get-international-protection/) .
