###  If the IPO or IPAT recommends you should not be granted international
protection

If you do not appeal the decision, the Minister will then examine your
application to see if you should be granted [ permission to remain
](/en/moving-country/asylum-seekers-and-refugees/refugee-status-and-leave-to-
remain/permission-to-remain/) . The Minister also advises you of your right to
voluntarily return to the country you came from. If you decide to [
voluntarily return ](https://www.irishimmigration.ie/my-situation-has-changed-
since-i-arrived-in-ireland/voluntary-returns/) , you will be helped to do
this.

If you are not granted refugee status and you are granted subsidiary
protection instead, you can appeal if you want to. If you declared a refugee
following the appeal, your subsidiary protection status will be removed.

If you did not appeal, or your appeal was not granted, and the Minister
decides to not grant you permission to remain, the Minister may then make a
deportation order.
