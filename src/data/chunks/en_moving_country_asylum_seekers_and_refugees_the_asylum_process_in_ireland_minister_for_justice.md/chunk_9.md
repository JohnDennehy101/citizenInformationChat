##  Deportation orders

If the Minister for Justice has refused to give you a refugee or subsidiary
protection declaration or permission to remain, the Minister may make a
deportation order against you.

The notice of the [ deportation order ](https://www.irishimmigration.ie/my-
situation-has-changed-since-i-arrived-in-ireland/spouse-civil-partner-of-
irish-national-scheme/repatriation-division/) may require you to leave the
State within a specified period and to present yourself to a member of the
Garda Síochána or immigration officer at a date, time and place as specified
in the order.

Before making a deportation order, the Minister will notify you of their
intention to make the order. When notified you can make representations to the
Minister. The notification normally offers you the option to voluntarily leave
the State before a deportation order is made.

However, if you have been convicted of a serious crime or you are considered a
threat to national security, you cannot leave voluntarily. This means you will
be given a deportation order without an option to leave voluntarily and you
cannot later return to Ireland.
