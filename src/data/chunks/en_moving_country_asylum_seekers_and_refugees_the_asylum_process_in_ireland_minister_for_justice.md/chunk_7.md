###  Revoking a subsidiary protection declaration

The Minister for Justice can also revoke a subsidiary protection declaration
given to a person where:

  * The circumstances that led to you being eligible for subsidiary protection have ceased to exist or have changed so that international protection is no longer required 
  * Were given a refugee declaration on the basis of information furnished which was false or misleading 

Some acts disqualify you from subsidiary protection and can be used by the
Minister to revoke a declaration:

  * You have committed a crime against peace, a war crime or a crime against humanity 
  * You have committed a serious crime 
  * You are guilty of acts contrary to the purposes and principles of the United Nations 
  * You pose a danger to the community or the security of the State
