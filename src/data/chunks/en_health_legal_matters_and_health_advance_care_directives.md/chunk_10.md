##  How to make an Advance Healthcare Directive

Advance Healthcare Directives are free to make, change and cancel. You can
make one if you are aged 18 or over. You can make it at any time in your adult
life and not just if you have received a diagnosis which may later affect your
capacity.

When you make an Advance Healthcare Directive it must:

  * Be made in writing 
  * Signed in the presence of 2 witnesses 
  * Signed by your Designated Healthcare Representative (if you have one â€“ see below) 

You can make an Advance Healthcare Directive yourself or you can use the
Decision Support Service's [ Advance Healthcare Directive template form and
guide (pdf)
](https://decisionsupportservice.ie/sites/default/files/2023-12/Advance%20Healthcare%20Directive%20INTERACTIVE%20FINAL.pdf)
.

It is recommended that you let the people closest to you know about your AHD
and give a copy of it to your GP and any other healthcare professional who may
be treating you. All healthcare professionals must check if you have an AHD if
you lack the capacity to make a treatment decision.
