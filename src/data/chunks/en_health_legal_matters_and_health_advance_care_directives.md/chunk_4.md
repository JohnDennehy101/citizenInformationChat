##  Changes to Advance Healthcare Directives in 2023

The [ Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 ](/en/health/legal-matters-
and-health/assisted-decision-making-act/) sets out a system of supports for
adults who have difficulties with decision-making capacity. Advance Healthcare
Directives were already recognised in Ireland but the Act establishes a legal
framework for them since 26 April 2023.

As part of the Act, the Decision Support Service has been set up to support
the introduction of these changes.
