###  What does a Designated Healthcare Representative do?

Your Designated Healthcare Representative must make a record of any decision
made that relates to your Advance Healthcare Directive if you lose the
capacity (ability) to make certain healthcare and treatment decisions. They
have to do no later than 7 days after the decision is made.

Your Designated Healthcare Representative must provide a copy of this record
to you if you later regain capacity. The Decision Support Service can also
request a copy of this record.

The Decision Support Service can send someone to talk to you or your
Designated Healthcare Representative. For example it can send out a general or
special visitor if it receives a complaint about your Designated Healthcare
Representative, or wants to check that the agreement is working the way that
it should.
