###  How to change or end your Advance Healthcare Directive

You can cancel or end your Advance Healthcare Directive at any time, for free
if you have the capacity to do so.

If you are ending your Advance Healthcare Directive, you have to do this in
writing.

If you are changing your Advance Healthcare Directive, you have to:

  * Do this in writing 
  * Sign it on front of 2 witnesses 
  * Get it signed by your Designated Healthcare Representative if you have one 

You should review and, if necessary, update your AHD regularly so that it
reflects your wishes, especially after any major medical treatment or
diagnosis to make sure it reflects your medical history.
