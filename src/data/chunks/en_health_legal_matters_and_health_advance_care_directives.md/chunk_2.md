##  What is an Advance Healthcare Directive?

You can make a written statement about the type of medical or surgical
treatment you want or do not want, if in the future, you are unable to make
these decisions. This is called an Advance Healthcare Directive (AHD).

An AHD is only used if you lose capacity and you can no longer communicate
your wishes yourself. It lets your family, carers and healthcare professionals
know your wishes about your medical and surgical treatment if you are unable
to make or communicate those decisions yourself.

For example, you may not want to be resuscitated if your heart stops beating,
or you may not want to be kept alive with the use of a ventilator. It is
sometimes known as a living will, advance statement, advance decision or
advance refusal.

An Advance Healthcare Directive tells healthcare professionals how to care for
you according to your specific wishes, when you can’t accurately tell them
yourself. Advance Healthcare Directives also give clarity to your family about
the care you wish for.

You do not have to make an Advance Healthcare Directive if you don’t want to.
