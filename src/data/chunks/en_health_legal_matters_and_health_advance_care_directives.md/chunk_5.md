##  Role of the Designated Healthcare Representative

You can appoint someone you know and trust to act on your behalf if you lose
the ability to make certain decisions. This person will be your Designated
Healthcare Representative.

Based on the information in your Advance Healthcare Directive, they have the
power to:

  * Advise on and interpret your wishes, as set out in your AHD, to the healthcare professionals treating you 
  * Agree to, or refuse treatment on your behalf 

They can only do this if you do not have the ability to make healthcare
treatment decisions.

You can read the [ Code of Practice for the guidance of Designated Healthcare
Representatives ](https://decisionsupportservice.ie/resources/codes-
practice/code-practice-designated-healthcare-representatives) .
