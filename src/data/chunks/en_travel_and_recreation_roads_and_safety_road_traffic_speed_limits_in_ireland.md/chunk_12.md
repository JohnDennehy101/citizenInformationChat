###  Exceptions to speed limits

Speed limits do not apply in Ireland to ambulances, fire brigade services or
Garda vehicles being used during duty.

More information about speed limits is available in the [ Rules of the Road
(pdf) ](https://www.rsa.ie/docs/default-source/road-safety/rules-of-the-
road.pdf?sfvrsn=e0334acb_0) .

It is an offence for anyone to use a speed meter detector in any vehicle in
Ireland under the [ Road Traffic (Speed Meter Detectors) Regulations, 1991
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1991/en/si/0050.html) . Under this
legislation, importing, fitting and supplying speed meter detectors and
jammers is also an offence.

The Gardai are empowered to seize this equipment if it is found in your
vehicle or in your possession under the Customs Consolidation Act 1876.
