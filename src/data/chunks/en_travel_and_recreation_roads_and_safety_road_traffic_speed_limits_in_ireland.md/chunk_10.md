###  Special speed limits (30 km/h or 60 km/h.)

Special speed limits are sometimes applied to designated roads and zones
(mainly, for example, on roads outside built-up areas, around schools, etc.).
Special speed limits are generally for 30 km/h or 60 km/h. [ Local authorities
](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/942f74-local-authorities/) in Ireland can
introduce bye-laws to set special speed limits in designated areas. A member
of the public can [ object to and appeal an existing speed limit
](https://www.speedlimits.ie/appeals) contained within a Local Authorityâ€™s
current special speed limit bye-laws. You can get more information about speed
limit bye-laws and appeals on [ speedlimits.ie ](https://www.speedlimits.ie/)
