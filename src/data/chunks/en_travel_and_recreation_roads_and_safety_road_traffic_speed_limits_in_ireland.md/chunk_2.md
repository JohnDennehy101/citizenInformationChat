##  Introduction

The [ Department of Transport ](https://www.gov.ie/en/organisation/department-
of-transport/) sets national speed limits. There are 5 different types of
speed limits and different limits apply to different types of roads throughout
the country. If you are coming to Ireland for the first time or you are
learning to drive, it is important for you to be aware of the speed limit on
the roads.

Speed limits are expressed through distinctive road signs throughout the
country that state the limit in each area. These signs are found on every
motorway, major roads, and minor roads throughout Ireland. They consist of a
circular sign with a white background and a red border. The speed limit in
kilometres is shown in the centre of the sign in black numerals (i.e. 30
kilometres per hour, 60, 80, etc.). Road distances and speed limits in Ireland
are measured in kilometres. You can read more in the [ guidelines for setting
and managing speed limits in Ireland (pdf)
