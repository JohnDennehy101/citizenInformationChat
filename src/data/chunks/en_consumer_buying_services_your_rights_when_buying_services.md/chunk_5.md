##  What you can expect from the service

If you have a contract for a service, consumer law sets out the minimum
standards that apply to the service. Services must be _in conformity_ with the
contract you made. In conformity means the service is as you expect it would
be according to the contract you made with the trader.

Services must:

  * Work as the trader said they would 
  * Match any advertisement and any verbal or written information you got 
  * Meet the terms of the contract, where the service is supplied with goods or digital elements 

The trader must:

  * Provide the service in line with the contract 
  * Have the required skills to carry out the service 
  * Supply the service with reasonable care and attention 
  * Only use materials that are fit for purpose and match any descriptions you got 
  * Charge you a reasonable price, where the price is not agreed beforehand (for example, it was based on an estimate or quote) 
  * Comply with all applicable laws 

If a trader tells you they will provide a higher standard of care and skill
than can be reasonably expected, or if they are subject to a standard set by a
professional body or a code of practice, they will be held to that higher
standard.
