##  Before you buy

You have a legal right to certain information before you buy a service,
including:

  * The traderâ€™s business name, address and phone number 
  * Details about the service (if not already clear) 
  * Total price, or how it will be calculated 
  * Length of the contract (if applicable) 
  * Any extra charges, for example, delivery charges 
  * Your right to cancel (where it applies) 

The information must be clear, easy to understand and given to you before you
buy. You have additional rights to information [ if you buy online
](/en/consumer/shopping/shopping-online/) or [ from your doorstep
](/en/consumer/shopping/buying-from-a-doorstep-seller/) .

Traders must not make claims that would distort your buying decisions. A
seller who makes a false or misleading claim about a service is committing an
offence and can be prosecuted.
