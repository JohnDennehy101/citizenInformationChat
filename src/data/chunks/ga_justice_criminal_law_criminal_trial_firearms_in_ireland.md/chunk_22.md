###  **Deactivated firearms**

A deactivated firearm is not capable of being fired. There are certain
regulations you must follow for a firearm to be considered deactivated,
including:

  * Complying with minimum standards 
  * An accompanying certificate from an appropriate authority 
  * The firearm being appropriately marked 

If the firearm was deactivated before 8 April 2016, less strict requirements
apply.

Once deactivated, you can seek an authorisation to keep the firearm.
