###  **How do I prove I am competent to use a firearm?**

If it is your first time applying for a firearm certificate, you must show you
are competent to use a firearm. You can prove this by:

  * Attending a firearms training course 
  * Joining an authorised rifle or pistol club or range 

[ An Garda Síochána ](https://control.citizensinformation.ie/en/justice/law-
enforcement/garda-siochana-national-police-force/) may ask for more
information or clarification before issuing your certificate.
