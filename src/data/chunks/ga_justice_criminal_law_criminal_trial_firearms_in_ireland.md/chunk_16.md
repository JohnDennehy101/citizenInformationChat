###  **Safely storing a firearm**

If you have or use firearms, you must meet the detailed requirements [ set out
in legislation ](https://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2009/si/307/made/en) for
storing them safely.

This storage depends on the type and number of firearms you hold. The usual
requirements are that firearms are stored within structurally solid buildings
or in purpose-built cabinets or gun rooms.

You should never store guns in easy-to-access locations or in unattended
vehicles.

When you apply for a firearm certificate, a member of An Garda Síochána may
inspect your proposed secure place of storage.
