###  **Firearm** **training certificate**

From the age of 14, you can apply for a [ firearm training certificate (pdf)
](https://www.garda.ie/en/about-us/online-services/firearms-
licensing/fca1_firearm_certificate_application-copy.pdf) . If you only have a
firearm training certificate, you cannot own a gun.

With a firearm training certificate, however, you can use a non-restricted
firearm when hunting or target shooting if:

  * You are being supervised by someone over 18 years 
  * This supervisor holds a firearm certificate for that specific firearm 

You can only do target shooting with your firearms training certificate at an
authorised shooting range or at an authorised shooting rifle or pistol club.

If you fail to use a firearm in line with a firearms training certificate,
your certificate could be withdrawn and/or you could be charged with a
criminal offence.
