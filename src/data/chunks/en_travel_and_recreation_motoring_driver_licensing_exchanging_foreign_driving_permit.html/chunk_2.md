##  Introduction

You can exchange a driving licence issued by an [ EU member state
](/en/government-in-ireland/european-government/european-union/european-
union/) or an EEA member state (Norway, Liechtenstein, and Iceland) for an
Irish driving licence.

You can also exchange a driving licence issued by certain recognised states
for an Irish driving licence. See ‘Recognised states below’.

You can drive on your Ukrainian driving licence while in Ireland under
temporary protection. You can no longer exchange your Ukrainian licence for an
Irish licence. Read more in our page on [ coming to Ireland from Ukraine
](/en/moving-country/asylum-seekers-and-refugees/the-asylum-process-in-
ireland/coming-to-ireland-from-ukraine#l1cd8a) .

If your driving licence was issued by a country that is not recognised for
driving licence exchange, you cannot exchange your licence for an Irish
licence. You must go through the full driver licensing procedure starting with
the [ driver theory test ](/en/travel-and-recreation/motoring/driving-
tests/driver-theory-test/) . However, when you have your learner permit, you
will only need to take 6 essential driver training (EDT) lessons instead of
the usual 12 lessons.
