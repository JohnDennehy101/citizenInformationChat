##  What counts as full-time care?

If you meet the qualifying conditions above, you can get a ‘HomeCaring Period’
added to your social insurance record for **each week** you cared full-time
for:

  * A child (or children) aged under 12, including children who were adopted or fostered 
  * A child (or children) aged 12 or over who needed an increased level of care 
  * An adult who needed an increased level of care 

You are automatically considered to have been a full-time home carer of
someone if you got [ Carer’s Allowance
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/carers/carers-
allowance/) , [ Carer’s Benefit
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/carers/carers-benefit/)
, or [ Domiciliary Care Allowance
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/disability-and-
illness/domiciliary-care-allowance/) for them.

The person you care for must not have been getting full time assistance within
their own residence from someone other than you for the week in question.

Only one person can get a HomeCaring Period on their social insurance record
for helping a particular person at a time.
