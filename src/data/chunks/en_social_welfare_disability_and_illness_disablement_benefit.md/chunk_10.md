###  Declaring an occupational injury

All work accidents or occupational diseases may not result immediately in
illness or disablement. If you are not immediately incapacitated but wish to
**safeguard your future right to Disablement Benefit** , you should notify
your employer about the accident or disease and apply for a declaration that
your accident or disease was an occupational one. This should be done without
delay. Declaration forms are available from the Injury Benefit Section of the
Department of Social Protection (see 'Where to apply' below).

If your disablement occurs at a later stage, you should claim within 3 months
of becoming aware of it.
