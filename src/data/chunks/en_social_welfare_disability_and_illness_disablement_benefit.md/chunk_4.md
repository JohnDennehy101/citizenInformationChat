###  Constant Attendance Allowance

This allowance can be paid weekly as an increase to Disablement Pension if you
are so seriously disabled as to need someone (a relative or some other person)
to help you daily at home to attend to your personal needs for a period of at
least 6 months. You must be getting a Disablement Pension of 50% or over.
Entitlement to Constant Attendance Allowance is based on the recommendation of
the Department of Social Protection's medical advisor. You will not get the
allowance during any period you are in a hospital or similar institution.
Constant Attendance Allowance is not payable outside the EU.
