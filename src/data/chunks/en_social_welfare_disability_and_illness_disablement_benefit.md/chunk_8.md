###  Loss of physical or mental faculty

The extent of your disablement is assessed by a Department of Social
Protection Medical Assessor. The Medical Assessor determines the extent of
your loss of faculty resulting from your occupational accident or disease.
'Loss of faculty' means your inability to enjoy a normal lifestyle because of
the loss, or partial loss, of your ordinary physical or mental abilities as a
result of your occupational injury or disease. In assessing the degree of loss
of faculty, account is taken of how your current physical and mental condition
compares to your pre-accident state of health, and how you compare with a
healthy person of the same age and sex.

Examples of assessments are as follows:

**Injury** |  **Disablement**  
---|---  
Loss of both hands  |  100%   
Loss of one eye  |  40%   
Loss of thumb  |  30%   
Loss of 2 fingers of one hand  |  20%   
Loss of index finger  |  14%
