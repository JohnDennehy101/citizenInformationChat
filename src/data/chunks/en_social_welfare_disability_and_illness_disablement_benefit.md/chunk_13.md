###  Disablement Benefit

Your payment depends on the degree of your disablement, which is medically
assessed. For assessments of less than 20%, Disablement Benefit will normally
be a lump sum (gratuity). The size of the lump sum will vary depending on the
degree of disablement and how long you are expected to be disabled. For
assessments of 20% upwards, a pension is payable.
