###  PRSI contributions

In order to qualify for Disablement Benefit, you must have been in employment
on or after 1 May 1967, that was insurable at PRSI Class A, B, D, J or M, at
the time that you sustained the accident or disease.

(Under the Occupational Injuries Scheme, [ civil servants ](/en/government-in-
ireland/how-government-works/national-government/the-civil-service/) insured
at PRSI Class B are not eligible for Disablement Benefit for the first 26
weeks after the date of the accident. This is because, for this 26-week
period, civil servants continue to be paid by their parent Department. After
this 26-week period, a civil servant is paid half their salary and half-rate
Disablement Benefit).
