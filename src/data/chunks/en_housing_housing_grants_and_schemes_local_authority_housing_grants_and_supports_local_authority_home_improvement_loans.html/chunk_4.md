###  Income test

You only need to satisfy this income test if you need the loan to improve your
home because it is overcrowded and you are not covered by one of the other
criteria above.

You qualify if:

  * You are a single-income household and your gross income before tax in the last income tax year was €40,000 or less 
  * You are a two-income household and your income is €100,000 or less after this calculation. Multiply the gross income (before tax) of the higher earner in the last income tax year by 2.5 and add the gross income of the other earner in the last income tax year.
