The time limits for summary offences do not apply to an [ indictable offence
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/justice/criminal-law/criminal-
offences/classification-of-crimes-in-criminal-cases/) . There is no time limit
for the start of legal proceedings for an indictable offence unless specific
legislation provides one.

But if there is an excessively long delay in prosecuting an offence, the judge
may decide not to hear the case. In making this decision, the judge considers
if the delay has reduced your chances of a fair trial. For example, if the
delay means that key [ witnesses
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/justice/witnesses/types-of-witnesses/)
are no longer available to give evidence or if the delay could have affected
their memory of what happened.

An indictable offence can be tried in the District Court (summarily) or it can
be tried by a judge and jury in the Circuit Court or the [ Central Criminal
Court ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/justice/courts-system/high-
court/) ). This is set out in [ Section 7 of the Criminal Justice Act 1951
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1951/en/act/pub/0002/sec0007.html) (as
amended by [ Section 177 of the Criminal Justice Act 2006
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2006/en/act/pub/0026/sec0177.html) ).
