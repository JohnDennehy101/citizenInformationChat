###  Summons issued for non-payment of fixed charge fines

When you are issued with a fixed charge notice for a [ road traffic offence
](/en/travel-and-recreation/motoring/driving-offences/driving-offences/) and
you fail to pay the fine within the time allowed, a summons is automatically
issued and sent to you by ordinary post. The Garda does not have to apply for
a summons to be issued in this process, because the summons is triggered by
non-payment of the fixed charge fine.
