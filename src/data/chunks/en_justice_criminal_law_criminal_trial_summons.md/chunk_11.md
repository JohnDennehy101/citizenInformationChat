##  Adjournments

If you do not appear in court on the date stated in the summons, the District
Court can either:

  * Go ahead with the hearing in your absence, or 
  * Decide to adjourn the matter 

If the matter is adjourned, you will be notified of a new date for the
hearing. If you donâ€™t turn up in court on the adjourned date, and the judge is
satisfied you were given reasonable notice of the adjourned hearing, the court
can:

  * Issue a warrant for your arrest to bring you to court, or 
  * Go ahead with the hearing in your absence
