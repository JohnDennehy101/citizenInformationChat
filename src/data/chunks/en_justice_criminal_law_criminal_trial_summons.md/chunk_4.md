###  Summons issued following complaints from private individuals

Summons issued under the Petty Sessions (Ireland) Act 1851 are used in private
prosecutions, for example, where people are having difficulty with their
neighbours.

The complainant goes before a District Court judge and makes the complaint
either orally or in writing. The judge decides if the complainant needs to
make the complaint under oath.

The complainant should provide the following information:

  * The name and address of the alleged offender 
  * The name and address of the complainant 
  * The basic facts of the alleged offence, including when it is alleged to have taken place 
  * The piece of legislation which applies to the offence, if possible 

The judge reviews this information and decides if it justifies a summons. If
the judge issues a summons the alleged offender will have to appear at a
sitting of the court. This process is rarely used by the Garda√≠.
