##  Time limit to apply for a social welfare payment

To get a social welfare payment, you must apply to the Department of Social
Protection (DSP) for that payment. In general, you must complete an
application form (claim form) within a certain time limit.

The time limit to apply varies, depending on which payment youâ€™re applying
for. In general, the time limits are quite short for short-term payments and
are longer for long-term pensions.

The DSP considers the day it get your application as the day you applied.
