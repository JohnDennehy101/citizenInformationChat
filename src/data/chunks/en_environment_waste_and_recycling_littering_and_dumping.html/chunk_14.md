###  Plastic bags

Shops that supply plastic bags must charge customers a levy on each shopping
bag. This is to encourage people to use reusable bags. Revenue generated from
the levy goes into the [ Circular Economy Fund
](https://www.localgov.ie/services/waste-management/littering-and-illegal-
dumping) .

The charge is 22 cent per bag and this must be itemised on any invoice, till
receipt or docket you receive. Reusable shopping bags are exempt from the
levy, as long as the retailer charges at least 70 cent for the bag.

To make a complaint about a retailer who is not charging for plastic bags, you
should contact the Environmental Awareness Officer of your [ local authority
](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/942f74-local-authorities/) . Find out more
