###  **Deportation**

If you are being deported to Ireland, you can get [ consular assistance
](https://www.ireland.ie/en/dfa/overseas-travel/assistance-
abroad/deportation/) from the [ local Irish embassy or consulate
](https://www.ireland.ie/en/dfa/embassies/) .

Make sure to ask for a copy of your deportation papers before your return. You
may need these when applying for social welfare payments and other services.
You will also need photo ID, ideally a passport.

If the Irish embassy or consulate gives you an emergency travel document, make
sure to request a copy of it, as passport control will keep your travel
document when you arrive in Ireland.
