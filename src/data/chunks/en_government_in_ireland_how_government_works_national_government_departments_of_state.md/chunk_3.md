##  What do government ministers do?

The minister is responsible for their department and the Taoiseach can remove
a minister at any time. Ministers are part of the Government and sit at
cabinet meetings, where decisions about government policy and proposals for
new Government bills are decided.

The minister may suggest and propose new or amended [ legislation
](/en/government-in-ireland/houses-of-the-oireachtas/legislation/) to the
Government relating to matters that arise in their department.

Ministers also have a power to make _Statutory Instruments_ which are also
known as delegated or [ secondary legislation ](/en/government-in-
ireland/houses-of-the-oireachtas/legislation#l5055d) . A Minister may only
make a Statutory Instrument if they are permitted to do so in primary
legislation. For example, the Immigration Act 2004 gives the Minister for
Justice the power to make an order adding or removing a country from the list
of countries whose citizens need a visa to enter Ireland.
