##  Introduction

This page is a guide to some of the practical concerns you may have when
someone close to you dies. It answers questions you may have on accessing
money, getting help with funeral expenses, dealing with your loved one’s
estate, and other practical issues you may be worried about.

Bereavement can be overwhelming and you may be going through many different
emotions. Don’t be afraid to ask for help if you need it. You will find a list
of organisations that can support you and your family at the end of this page.
