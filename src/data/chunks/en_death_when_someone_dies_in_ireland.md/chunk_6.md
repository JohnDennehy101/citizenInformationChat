###  Funeral costs

In some cases, a funeral may be partially or fully paid for in advance, or the
funeral costs are covered by an insurance policy. Otherwise, the person who
arranges the funeral must pay the funeral director for the cost of the
funeral. This can be repaid from the deceasedâ€™s estate (the money and property
the person left behind).

If you have difficulty paying for the funeral you can [ apply for help from
the Department of Social Protection ](/en/social-welfare/supplementary-
welfare-schemes/additional-needs-payment/) .
