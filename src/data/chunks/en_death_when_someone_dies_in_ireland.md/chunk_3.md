##  Registering a death

Every death in Ireland must be [ recorded and registered
](/en/death/practical-arrangements-after-a-death/registering-a-death/) at a
civil registration office. You should register the death as soon as possible.
It must be registered within 3 months. You need a death notification form,
which you can get from the doctor who attended the person. Normally, a close
family relative registers the death. If there are no relatives available to do
this, the death can be registered by anyone who has knowledge of the death.

If the death was sudden or unexplained, the [ coroner ](/en/death/sudden-or-
unexplained-death/coroners/) may be appointed to [ hold an inquest
](/en/death/sudden-or-unexplained-death/inquests-and-inquest-reports/) about
the circumstances surrounding the death. A [ post-mortem examination
](/en/death/sudden-or-unexplained-death/postmortems/) may be carried out to
establish the cause of death.
