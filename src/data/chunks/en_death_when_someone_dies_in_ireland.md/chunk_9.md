##  Legal issues

You must get a legal document to give you the authority to administer the
deceased person’s estate. This is a legal order called a [ Grant of
Representation ](/en/death/the-deceaseds-estate/dealing-with-the-deceaseds-
estate#l4c8af) .

If the deceased person left a will, the person who deals with the estate is
called the deceased person’s executor. The executor needs to take out probate.
Taking out probate means having the [ Probate Office
](https://www.courts.ie/probate) or the appropriate District Probate Registry
certify that:

  * The will is valid 
  * All legal, financial and tax matters are in order 

Wills only take effect when the Probate Office accepts that the will is valid.
The Probate Office may make some enquiries before making its decision, for
example, it may ask for a sworn affidavit from one or both witnesses

If there is no will, the person who deals with the deceased person’s estate is
called an ‘administrator’. An administrator may also be appointed if there is
a will but:

  * No executor has been appointed 
  * The appointed person cannot act as executor 
  * The executor cannot or will not carry out their duties 

The administrator needs to take out a [ Letter of Administration
](/en/death/the-deceaseds-estate/dealing-with-the-deceaseds-estate#l56c52) (or
a Letter of Administration with Will Annexed if there is a will).
