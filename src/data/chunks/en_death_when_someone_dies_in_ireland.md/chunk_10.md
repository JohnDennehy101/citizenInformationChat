##  Help and support

Talking to someone you trust about your feelings of loss can be a great
support at this time. But sometimes family and friends may be unable to help.
If this is the case, bereavement counselling may help.

Bereavement counselling helps you to explore, understand and work through
feelings of grief. Often, just getting reassurance can help.
