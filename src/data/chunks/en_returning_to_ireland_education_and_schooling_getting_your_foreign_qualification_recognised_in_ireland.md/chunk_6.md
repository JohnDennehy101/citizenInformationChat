###  **Non-EU students**

If you are a non-EU student, contact the admissions office of the college
where you want to study to ask if you should apply directly to them or through
the CAO.

It is very important to check the application procedure for your course, as
you may not be able to make changes after you submit your application. You
should make your enquiries well before the CAO closing date of 1 February in
the year your course starts, preferably not later than the previous 15
December.

requirements ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/education/third-level-
