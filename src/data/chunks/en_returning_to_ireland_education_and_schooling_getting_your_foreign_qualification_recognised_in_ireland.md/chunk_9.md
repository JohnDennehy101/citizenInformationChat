##  The National Framework of Qualifications (NFQ)

The [ National Framework of Qualifications (NFQ) ](https://www.qqi.ie/what-we-
do/the-qualifications-system/national-framework-of-qualifications) is a system
of 10 levels that allow you to compare different types of qualifications
available in Ireland.

Qualifications on the framework include:

  * Junior Cycle (NFQ Levels 1, 2, and 3) 
  * Leaving Certificate (NFQ Levels 4 and 5) 
  * Advanced Certificate / Higher Certificate (NFQ Level 6) 
  * Ordinary Bachelor Degree (NFQ Level 7) 
  * Honours Bachelor Degree / Higher Diploma (NFQ Level 8) 
  * Masters Degree / Postgraduate Diploma (NFQ Level 9) 
  * Doctoral Degree (NFQ Level 10) 

The NFQ helps you to make choices and consider what options are available for
your further studies. The NFQ can also help you explain what qualifications
you hold or are studying for. This is important when you are considering
further learning or when you are applying for a job at home or abroad.

For example, a Bachelor Honours Degree from Australia is comparable to an
Honours Bachelor Degree in Ireland at NFQ Level 8. A Master Craftsmanâ€™s
Diploma (Meisterbrief pre-December 2012) from Germany is comparable to an
Advanced Certificate in Ireland at NFQ Level 6.
