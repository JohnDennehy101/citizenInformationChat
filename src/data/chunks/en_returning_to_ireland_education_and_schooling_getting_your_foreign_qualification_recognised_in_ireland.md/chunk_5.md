##  Can I apply to college in Ireland if I have a non-Irish qualification?

If you are an EU student and you want to study an undergraduate course in
Ireland, you should apply through the [ Central Applications Office (CAO)
](http://www.cao.ie/) . The CAO manages a centralised application system for
most full-time undergraduate courses in Ireland. In general, you do not apply
to the college directly for your place.

For postgraduate courses, you generally apply directly to the university or
college. Contact the admissions office of the institution you want to attend
for more information.
