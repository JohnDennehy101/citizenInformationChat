##  How do I get my academic qualification recognised in Ireland?

You can compare your foreign qualification to an Irish qualification of a
similar type on the [ NARIC website
](https://qsearch.qqi.ie/WebPart/Search?searchtype=recognitions) . NARIC
compares academic qualifications based on the Irish National Framework of
Qualifications (NFQ). The NFQ is a system of 10 levels used to describe
qualifications in the Irish education and training system.

To compare your qualification:

  1. Search for your foreign qualification on the [ NARIC database ](http://qsearch.qqi.ie/WebPart/Search?searchtype=recognitions)
  2. Download a comparability statement 

The comparability statement will help you, your employer, or education
provider to understand your qualification in relation to the Irish education
system.

If your qualification is not listed on the NARIC database, NARIC may be able
to give you a generic comparability statement for your foreign qualification.
