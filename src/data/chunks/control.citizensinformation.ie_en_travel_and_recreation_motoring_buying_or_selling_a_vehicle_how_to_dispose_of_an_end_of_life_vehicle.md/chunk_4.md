##  Where can I bring my end-of-life vehicle?

You **must** leave an end-of-life vehicle at an [ authorised treatment
facility ](https://www.elves.ie/en) .

Each vehicle manufacturer or importer must have a national collection system
in place. It must be with at least one treatment facility in every city and
council area.

These facilities provide a free take-back service for vehicles of that
producerâ€™s brand. Independent treatment facilities are also available.

If you leave an end-of-life vehicle at an unauthorised facility, you will not
get a certificate of destruction. You may remain recorded as registered owner
of the vehicle on the National Vehicle File.

Authorised treatment facilities are not responsible for transporting your
vehicle. You will have to arrange to bring the ELV to the facility yourself.

When you have left your vehicle at an authorised treatment facility, the owner
or operator of the facility will:

  * Issue you (if you are the registered owner) with a **certificate of destruction**
  * Forward the details of the certificate of destruction to the National Vehicle and Driver File. These records are kept by the Department of Transport
