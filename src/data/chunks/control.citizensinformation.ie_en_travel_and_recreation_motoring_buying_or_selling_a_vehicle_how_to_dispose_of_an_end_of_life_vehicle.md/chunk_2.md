##  Introduction

An end-of-life vehicle (ELV) is a car or light commercial vehicle (of less
than 3.5 tonnes) which is due to be disposed of or scrapped. So, when a car
gets old and can't be used anymore, it becomes an ELV. It's important to
recycle and dispose of ELVs properly so they don't harm the environment.

You must dispose of an end-of-life vehicle using licensed _authorised
treatment facilities_ (ATFs) _._ These are also called _permitted scrapyards_
. End of life vehicles contain hazardous materials that can damage the
environment. They can pose a risk to public health if not disposed of in a
safe manner. For example, vehicles that contain lead acid batteries,
lubricating oil, coolant, brake fluid, and catalytic convertors.

To make sure that old cars are disposed of in a proper way, there is a
compliance scheme (ELVES) in place. This is to help improve standards in
disposing of end of life vehicles.

You are committing a criminal offence if you (or an authorised treatment
facility) dispose of an end-of-life vehicle illegally.

There is no charge for disposing of an ELV at an authorised treatment
facility. When you have given your vehicle to an ATF, you should get a
certificate of destruction.

If you (or an authorised treatment facility) dispose of an end-of-life vehicle
illegally, you are committing a criminal offence.
