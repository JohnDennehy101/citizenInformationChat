##  Introduction

Employees can avail of certain share options from their company that may be
exempt from income tax.

There are 3 main ways in which an employee can benefit from shares in the
company:

  * Approved Profit-Sharing Schemes 
  * Share Options 
  * Key Employee Engagement Programme (KEEP) 

Generally, gains arising from various share schemes are subject to the
Universal Social Charge (USC) and Pay Related Social Insurance (PRSI). Gains
from share options on the KEEP programme are instead subject to [ Capital
Gains Tax ](/en/money-and-tax/tax/capital-taxes/capital-gains-tax/) .
