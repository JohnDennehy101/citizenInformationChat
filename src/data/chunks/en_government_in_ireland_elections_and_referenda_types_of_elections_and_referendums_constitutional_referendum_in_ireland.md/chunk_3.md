##  Constitutional referendum

[ Article 46 of the Constitution
](https://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/cons/en/html#part15) sets out the rules
for how the Constitution can be amended. [ Article 47
](https://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/cons/en/html#part16) sets out the basic
rules for referendums. A body of legislation, including a series of Referendum
Acts, governs how they operate.

For a constitutional referendum, a Bill is first introduced in the [ Dáil
](/en/government-in-ireland/houses-of-the-oireachtas/dail-eireann/) , setting
out the wording of the proposed amendment. If both the Dáil and the [ Seanad
](/en/government-in-ireland/houses-of-the-oireachtas/the-seanad/) pass the
Bill, the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage makes an order
specifying the polling day for the referendum.
