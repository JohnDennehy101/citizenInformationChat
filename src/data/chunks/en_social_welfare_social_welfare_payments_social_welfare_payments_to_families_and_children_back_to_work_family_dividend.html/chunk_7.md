##  Rate of Back to Work Family Dividend

The Back to Work Family Dividend (BTWFD) is based on the rate of [ Increase
for a Qualified Child (IQC) ](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-
system/claiming-a-social-welfare-payment/claiming-and-increase-in-your-
payment-for-a-child-dependant/) you were getting with your social welfare
payment. It is paid for each child (up to a limit of 4 children).

If you were getting a reduced IQC with your payment, you will get the same
reduced amount BTWFD in your first year, and then half of that amount in the
second year.

From January 2024, the full BTWFD is €46 for a child aged under 12 and €54 for
a child aged 12 and over. In the second year, it is reduced to €23 for a child
aged under 12 and €27 for a child aged 12 and over.
