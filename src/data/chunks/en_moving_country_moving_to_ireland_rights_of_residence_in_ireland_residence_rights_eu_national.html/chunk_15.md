###  Step 3: Register with immigration

Immigration Service Delivery (ISD) may send your non-EEA family member a
letter inviting them to register and get a temporary [ Irish Residence Permit
](/en/moving-country/moving-to-ireland/rights-of-residence-in-
ireland/registration-of-non-eea-nationals-in-ireland/) while they are waiting
for the application to be fully processed. This applies only to qualifying
family members and only if they have sent enough documentation to prove their
relationship with you and that you have a right to reside in Ireland (because
you are working here for example).
