##  Residence rights of family members

If you have the right to reside in Ireland based on one of the categories
described above, then your family has the right to reside in Ireland with you.

If your family members are also EEA, Swiss or UK citizens, then you do not
have to make an application for them to join you here in Ireland. They do not
have to register with Immigration Service Delivery (the Irish immigration
authorities).

If your family members are not EEA, Swiss or UK citizens, they must apply for
residence.
