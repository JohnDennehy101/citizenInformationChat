###  **Income from maintenance**

Maintenance payments for you are assessed in the means test. However, child
maintenance payments are not included.

If you are getting maintenance from more than one person, all the payments are
added together and the total is assessed. However, only half of your income
from maintenance is assessed as means.

If you have housing costs, your rent or mortgage repayment up to a maximum of
â‚¬95.23 per week can be offset against maintenance payments. Half the balance
is then assessed as means. You must provide proof of rent or mortgage
payments.
