####  **Death of a spouse, partner or civil partner**

If you applied for the One-Parent Family Payment because you are parenting
alone following the death of your spouse, partner or civil partner, you may
get OFP for 2 years from the date of death. You cannot be paid OFP after your
youngest child reaches 18 even if it is less than 2 years after the date of
death.
