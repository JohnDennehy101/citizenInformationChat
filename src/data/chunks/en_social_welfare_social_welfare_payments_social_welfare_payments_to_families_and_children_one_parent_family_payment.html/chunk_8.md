####  **Carer’s Allowance**

If you are getting OFP and providing full-time care and attention to one of
your children or for an adult (such as a sibling or a parent), you can keep
your OFP and also claim [ half-rate Carer’s Allowance ](/en/social-
welfare/carers/half-rate-carers-allowance/) , until your youngest child’s
turns 16. You must meet the conditions for both schemes.

You will also get an [ Increase for a Qualified Child (IQC) ](/en/social-
welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/claiming-a-social-welfare-
payment/claiming-and-increase-in-your-payment-for-a-child-dependant/) for any
other children in the family until they reach 18 (or 22 if in full-time
education) as long as you are getting Carer’s Allowance and OFP.
