###  Foreign language assistants scheme  

This scheme allows for language assistants from France, Germany, Spain,
Austria, Italy and Belgium/Wallonia-Brussels to be assigned to post-primary
schools and colleges in Ireland. Their fluency can help students understand
and speak a foreign language and give them a better understanding of the way
of life and customs of other countries. In the same way Irish students of
French, German, Italian and Spanish can apply to work as English language
assistants in the countries listed above. You can find details of the [
