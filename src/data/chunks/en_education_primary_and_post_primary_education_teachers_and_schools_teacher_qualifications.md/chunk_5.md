###  Post-primary teachers

Post-primary teachers are normally required to teach at least 1 subject which
they have studied to degree level. Post-primary teachers do not need to have a
qualification in the Irish language unless they are employed by a Gaeltacht
school or a school where Irish is the medium of instruction.

Qualification is usually achieved by gaining a primary degree from a [
recognised third-level institution
](https://www.gov.ie/en/collection/6f762-employing-a-teacher/) . This degree
must include at least 1 subject from the [ post-primary schoolsâ€™ curriculum
](https://www.curriculumonline.ie/Senior-cycle/Curriculum/) for the Leaving
Certificate Programme. The Teaching Council is the professional standards body
for teaching. The Council promotes and regulates the profession. The primary
degree is followed by a postgraduate qualification in education such as the
Professional Masters in Education (PME).
