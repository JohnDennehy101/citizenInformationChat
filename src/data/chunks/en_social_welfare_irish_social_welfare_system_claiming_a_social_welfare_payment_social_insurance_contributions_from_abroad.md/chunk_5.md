###  **Qualifying for social welfare payments**

If you have worked in Ireland and in one or more EU states, your social
insurance contributions from each EU state may be added to your Irish social
insurance contributions to help you qualify for one of the social welfare
payments listed below. In the case of some payments (for example, Jobseeker's
Benefit, Illness Benefit and Maternity Benefit) your last social insurance
contribution must be paid in Ireland.
