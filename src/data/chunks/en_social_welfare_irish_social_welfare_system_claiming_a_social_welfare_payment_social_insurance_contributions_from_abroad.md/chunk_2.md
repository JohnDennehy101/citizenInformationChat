##  Introduction

Ireland has social security arrangements with other countries that allow you
to combine social insurance contributions that you have paid in Ireland with
social insurance contributions that you have paid in another country. This can
help you to qualify for a [ social insurance payment ](/en/social-
welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/social-insurance-prsi/social-insurance/)
in Ireland or in a country with whom Ireland has a social security
arrangement.

The social security arrangements that Ireland has with other countries can be
divided broadly into 2 groups:

  * European Union (EU) regulations 
  * Bilateral social security agreements
