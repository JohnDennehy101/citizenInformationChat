####  **Step 2**

The following formula is then applied:

  
(A x B)/C

  * A = the notional rate of pension (see **step 1** to calculate the notional rate of pension) 
  * B = the number of Irish contributions 
  * C = the total number of contributions (Irish + non-Irish) 

**Note:**

In the agreements with Austria, Australia, Canada, Quebec and UK, (as under EU
legislation), where there are less than 52 contributions paid in the other
country and a pension is not awarded by that country, the Irish pension is
awarded on the sum of the 2 insurance records without the application of the
pro-rata rule.
