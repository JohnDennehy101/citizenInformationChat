##  How to apply

When you are filling in or completing an application for an Irish social
insurance payment, a section on the application form asks you whether you have
ever been employed in an EU country other than Ireland. In the case of long-
term payments, you will be asked if you have ever been employed in an EU
country or a country with whom Ireland has a bilateral social security
agreement.

You will be asked for the following information:

  * The country where you worked 
  * The name and address of your employer there 
  * The dates you worked there 
  * Your Social Security Number there 

The Department of Social Protection will then request your social insurance
contribution history records from the other member state or foreign
institution directly.
