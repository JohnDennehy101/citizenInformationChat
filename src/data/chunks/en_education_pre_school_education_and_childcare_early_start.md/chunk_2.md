##  What is the Early Start Pre-School Programme?

The Early Start Pre-School Programme is a one-year pre-school programme
offered in selected schools in some disadvantaged areas.

Early Start is for children aged between 3 and 5 years who are at risk of not
reaching their potential in school.

A child may either be enrolled in Early Start or in the [ Early Childhood Care
and Education (ECCE) Scheme ](/en/education/pre-school-education-and-
childcare/early-childhood-care-and-education-scheme/) . They cannot be
enrolled in both schemes at the same time.

You can get [ a list of the schools in the Early Start Programme

Department of Education website.
