##  Paying water charges

All commercial premises must pay their water charges, unless a personal
hardship waiver applies. If you do not pay, Irish Water can take you to the
District Court to recover the charges from you. Alternatively, it can
disconnect or restrict your water supply. However, this is rarely done because
of implications for health and safety.

Payments are now collected by Irish Water (previously the local authorities).
[ You can pay your water charges bill in a number of ways.

**Group water schemes** are responsible for monitoring themselves. Commercial
members of group schemes who do not pay their share of the maintenance costs
must be dealt with by the group and its trustees. It is up to the members and
trustees of group schemes to decide who should pay what and the grounds on
which charges can be waived or reduced.

If you are in a private group scheme and you are finding it difficult to make
your payments, you should discuss this with the trustees of the group.
