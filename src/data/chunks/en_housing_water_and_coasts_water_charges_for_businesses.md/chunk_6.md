##  Businesses in group water schemes

Commercial premises (like farms or other rural businesses) that are members of
[ group water schemes ](/en/housing/water-and-coasts/water-charges-for-group-
schemes/) have to pay for the water they use for running their businesses.
They get a _standard domestic allowance_ to cover their domestic water usage.
In most cases, this usage is monitored by a water meter. The _standard
domestic allowance_ is deducted from the total usage to determine how much
water was used by the business.

If the business owner is in a public group water scheme, the local authority
will charge the business according to their usage at the set commercial rate.
If the business owner is in a private group water scheme, the group may charge
them according to their usage. Alternatively they can agree a fixed rate with
other group members.
