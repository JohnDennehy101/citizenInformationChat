This flat-rate charge is paid to Irish Water. The rate is calculated by
estimating how much water (and wastewater) your business uses. The volume of
water and wastewater will differ, depending on the type of business and the
number of employees. For example, a newsagent will be charged less than a
hairdresser because it uses less water. There is no minimum charge set down in
legislation. The rates were previously set by each local authority and
reviewed each year.
