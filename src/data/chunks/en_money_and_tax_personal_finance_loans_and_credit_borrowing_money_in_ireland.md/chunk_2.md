##  Introduction

There are different types of loans for different circumstances. It is
important to get the right loan for your needs. Loans are also known as
credit.

When choosing a loan, you should take into account the:

  * Amount 
  * Cost 
  * Time for repayment (also known as the term) 

Some loans are for specific purposes, for example, a mortgage for a house,
hire purchase for a car or in-store credit for other purchases. Some types of
credit are more flexible, for example, an overdraft or credit card.

There can be a very big difference in the cost of different types of loans.
When you decide which type is best for your needs, you can save money by
shopping around with different providers.

Generally, banks, building societies and other credit institutions charge for
the use of borrowed money. This payment is called [ interest ](/en/money-and-
tax/personal-finance/savings-and-investments/interest-on-loans-and-savings/)
and it is calculated on the amount of money you borrow and the length of time
that you borrow it. You may also have to pay fees to cover administrative
expenses on your loan.

If you have [ difficulty paying off a loan ](/en/money-and-tax/personal-
finance/debt/dealing-with-debt/) the Money Advice and Budgeting Service ( [
MABS ](/en/money-and-tax/personal-finance/debt/mabs-service/) ) may be able to
