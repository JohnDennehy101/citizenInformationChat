##  Personal Contract Plans (PCPs)

This is a type of hire purchase agreement offered by car dealers as a way to
pay for a car. In a PCP contract, you pay a deposit and continue to make
regular instalments, usually over 3 years. There is usually a large lump sum
payment at the end of the contract.

At the end of the contract you can either:

  * Pay the final lump sum and keep the car or 
  * Return the car to the seller 

You do not own the car until the final payment is made. If you return the car,
you can take out a new PCP on another car.

There may be rules about using the car, such as mileage limits and
requirements to service the car.

PCPs can seem very attractive because they usually have very low monthly
repayments but they can be complex compared to other types of car finance. It
is important to understand all the terms and conditions before you sign up for
a PCP. You can [ find out more about PCPs from the CCPC
