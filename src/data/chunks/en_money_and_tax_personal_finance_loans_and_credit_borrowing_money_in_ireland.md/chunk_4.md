##  Your credit history

If you have ever used credit, you have a credit history. This is information
about loans you have had and your repayment history. A credit institution can
refuse to give you a loan if you have not complied with the terms and
conditions of previous loans. The Central Credit Register provides credit
reports to borrowers and lenders. It is operated by the Central Bank of
Ireland. [ Read more about credit reports and your credit history ](/en/money-
