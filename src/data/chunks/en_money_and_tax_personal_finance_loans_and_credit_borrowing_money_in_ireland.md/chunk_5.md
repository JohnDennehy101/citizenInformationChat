##  Overdrafts

An [ overdraft ](/en/money-and-tax/personal-finance/loans-and-
credit/overdrafts/) is a way of borrowing on your bank account. Overdrafts are
given on your current account so that, when your account balance is zero, you
can still spend up to an agreed limit. Overdrafts usually have a higher
interest rate than personal loans but are flexible and can be useful for
short-term credit and relatively small amounts.
