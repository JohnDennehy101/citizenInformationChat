##  Mortgages and top-up mortgages

A [ mortgage ](/en/housing/owning-a-home/help-with-buying-a-home/taking-out-a-
mortgage/) is a long-term loan to finance a property purchase and is usually
secured on your home. A top-up mortgage is a way of extending your mortgage to
[ consolidate your debts
](https://www.ccpc.ie/consumers/money/loans/consolidating-debts/) or to pay
for a car or other large purchase.

Although APRs are low, this type of loan may cost you a lot more in the long
run if you pay it back over a longer term. Both mortgages and top-up mortgages
are secured on your home so it is very important that you keep up repayments
as otherwise your home may be at risk.

The CCPC has a [ mortgage comparison tool
](https://www.ccpc.ie/consumers/money-tools/mortgage-comparisons/) that shows
the interest rate, monthly repayments and total amount to repay for different
mortgages that are available.
