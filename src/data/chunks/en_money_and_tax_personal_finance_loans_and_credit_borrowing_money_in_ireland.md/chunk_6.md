##  Credit cards

A [ credit card ](https://www.ccpc.ie/consumers/money/credit-cards) allows you
to borrow a limited amount to pay for goods and services. There is no interest
charged on borrowings if you pay your full bill within a set number of days.

Credit cards are flexible and can be used to pay for items and services that
you may buy online or by phone. Credit cards are accepted to pay for goods and
services or to get cash.

They are not suitable for long-term borrowing because the interest rates are
high.

The CCPC has a [ credit card comparison tool
](https://www.ccpc.ie/consumers/money-tools/credit-card-comparisons/) that
shows the interest rates charged for different credit cards that are
available.
