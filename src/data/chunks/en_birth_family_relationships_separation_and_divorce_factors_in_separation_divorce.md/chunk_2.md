##  Introduction

In Ireland, you can legally end a marriage in three ways – a separation
agreement, judicial separation and divorce. You can also legally end a civil
partnership using a process called _dissolution_ .

In order to be granted a judicial separation, divorce or dissolution, you must
apply to the courts. The court will look at a range of factors when
considering your application, such as your income and standard of living.

Depending on your situation, the court can make _ancillary orders_ impacting
different aspects of your life. For example, these can relate to the custody
of your children and ownership of the family home.

This page outlines the most common ancillary orders in cases of separation,
divorce and dissolution. It also looks at the main factors considered by the
court when making these orders.

[ Separation agreements ](/en/birth-family-relationships/separation-and-
divorce/separation-agreement/) are instead negotiated through your solicitor
and your spouse’s solicitor, and do not need to go through the courts.
