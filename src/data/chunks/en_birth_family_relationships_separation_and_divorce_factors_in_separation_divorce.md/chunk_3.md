##  Ancillary orders

An _ancillary order_ (sometimes called an _ancillary relief_ ) is an order
made by the court to make sure that spouses and dependants (such as children)
are properly provided for following the breakdown of the marriage.

The family law courts can make a range of ancillary orders when granting a
judicial separation, divorce or dissolution.

Most ancillary court orders relate to:

  * Custody of children and access to children 
  * [ Maintenance ](/en/birth-family-relationships/separation-and-divorce/maintenance-orders-and-agreements/) payments and lump sum payments

  * Occupation of the family home or shared home 
  * Ownership of property and assets, such as shares 
  * [ Pension rights ](/en/birth-family-relationships/separation-and-divorce/sep-divorce-pensions/)
