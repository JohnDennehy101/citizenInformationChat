###  Health and safety leave after maternity leave

When an employee returns to work after maternity leave, any risk to her
because she has recently given birth (or because she is breastfeeding), should
be removed. If this is not possible, the employee should be moved to
alternative ‘risk-free’ work. If a move is not possible, she should be given
health and safety leave.

If a doctor certifies that night work is unsuitable after the birth,
alternative work should be provided. If alternative work cannot be provided,
the employee should be given health and safety leave.
