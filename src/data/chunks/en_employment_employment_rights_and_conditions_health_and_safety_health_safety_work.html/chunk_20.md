###  Protecting your health and safety rights

By law, you cannot be [ victimised ](/en/employment/enforcement-and-
redress/victimisation-at-work/) for taking action to access your rights under
health and safety legislation.

For example, your employer cannot penalise you for making a complaint to the
HSA about health and safety at work. Penalising could be dismissing you,
taking disciplinary action, or treating you less favourably than other
employees.
