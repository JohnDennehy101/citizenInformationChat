###  Social welfare payments

If you have an accident at work, you can apply for [ Injury Benefit
](/en/social-welfare/disability-and-illness/injury-benefit/) . This is a
weekly payment from the Department of Social Protection (DSP) for people who
are unfit for work due to an accident at work, or due to an occupational
disease.

You can also claim certain medical costs that are not paid by the HSE or
covered by the DSPâ€™s [ Treatment Benefit Scheme ](/en/social-
welfare/disability-and-illness/treatment-benefit-scheme/) . This is set out
under the [ Medical Care Scheme ](/en/social-welfare/disability-and-
illness/medical-care-scheme/) .

Read more about these payments in our page on the [ Occupational Injuries
Benefit Scheme ](/en/social-welfare/disability-and-illness/occupational-
injuries-benefit-overview/) .
