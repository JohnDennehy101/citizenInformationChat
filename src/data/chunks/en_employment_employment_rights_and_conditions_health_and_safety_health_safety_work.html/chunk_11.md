##  Protective equipment and other safety measures

Employers should tell employees about any risks that require wearing
protective equipment (such as protective clothing, headgear, footwear, eyewear
or gloves).

The employer should give employees the protective equipment (free of charge if
it is intended for use at the workplace only). They should also provide
training on how to use the equipment, where necessary.

Usually, employees are given their own personal equipment, rather than
equipment to share. Employees have a duty to take reasonable care for their
own safety and to use any protective equipment provided.
