###  Making an appeal

When you get the Review Notice of Determination, you will also get information
on your right to seek an independent appeal of this decision within 60 days. A
member of an independent panel of appeals officers carry out the appeal.

The decision of the appeals officer is final. However, this may be appealed to
the High Court, by either you, or the Appeals Office, on a point of law. This
must be done within 28 days.
