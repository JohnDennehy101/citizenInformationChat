###  Signing a legal waiver for payments

If you decide to accept a general or work-related payment under the scheme,
you will have to sign a legal waiver.

By signing the legal waiver, you agree that you will not take any further
action against the state related to your experience.

Signing a waiver will not stop you from discussing the payment you have
received from the scheme, if that is your wish.

To help you to decide if you want to take the payment and sign the waiver, you
can get financial support of â‚¬500 (ex VAT) for independent legal advice.

You have to pay for legal advice but the Payment Scheme Office will reimburse
you by bank transfer if you send them a copy of an invoice or receipt from a
solicitor for the advice.
