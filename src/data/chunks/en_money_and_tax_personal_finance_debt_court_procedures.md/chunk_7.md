##  District Court procedure

In general, the legal proceedings must be started in the [ District Court
](/en/justice/courts-system/district-court/) area where you live or where the
contract was made.

District Court proceedings are started when the creditor issues a claim notice
to you. This notice states the creditor’s claim – for example, that you owe
them €5,000 for goods bought on a specific date. [ Read more about the process
of issuing a claim notice ](/en/justice/civil-law/civil-summons-in-
ireland#l62caf) .

The notice gives you 2 options. You can:

  * Pay the amount claimed within 10 days and avoid a court appearance or 
  * Dispute the claim by providing the claimant with a completed [ appearance and defence form ](https://www.courts.ie/acc/alfresco/28a0f379-5c16-47f4-a8d7-7b89ddfb16e0/Appearance and defence - general No. 42.01.docx/file) within 28 days 
  * The [ claim notice must be served ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/justice/civil-law/district-court-procedures/#068405) on you. The creditor must provide proof that the notice of claim form was served within the legal time limit. This can be done either by: 
  * Oral evidence to the court or 
  * A [ statutory declaration of service ](https://www.courts.ie/content/endorsement-service-registered-post) , which must be lodged with the District Court Clerk at least 4 days before the court hearing. 

If you do not respond that you intend to defend the proceedings, there is no
hearing and the creditor gets a judgment that you owe the money. In this case,
the creditor files the following documents with the District Court Clerk:

  * An affidavit or statutory declaration of service of the claim notice. An _affidavit_ is a written statement that is sworn to be true by the person signing it. 
  * A certificate of no appearance or defence. 
  * An affidavit of debt verifying the creditor’s claim. 
  * A District Court decree. 

These are then checked and, if all documents are in order, the judge of the
District Court issues the judgment. The judgment is for the amount owed plus
the costs involved in the proceedings.

Having got the judgment, the creditor is then entitled to [ enforce the
judgment ](/en/money-and-tax/personal-finance/debt/enforcement-of-debt-
judgments/) . Interest on the amount of the judgment (but not the costs) is
charged from the day the judgment is given.
