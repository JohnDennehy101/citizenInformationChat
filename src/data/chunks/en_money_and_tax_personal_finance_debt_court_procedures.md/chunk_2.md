##  Introduction

If you owe money to someone, you are their debtor. The person (or group of
people or company) you owe money to is your creditor. They are entitled to ask
you to pay your debts but they are not entitled to harass or intimidate you to
pay.

If you fail to pay a debt, your creditor is likely to go to court to get a
judgment that you owe the debt.

If the creditor gets a judgment against you, they can use different ways to
get the money from you. This is called [ enforcing a judgment ](/en/money-and-
tax/personal-finance/debt/enforcement-of-debt-judgments/) .

If a judgment order is made against you, you usually have to pay your
creditorâ€™s costs in taking the case. These costs are added to the amount of
the judgment and can be enforced against you as part of the enforcement of the
judgment.
