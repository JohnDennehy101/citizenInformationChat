###  Initial notice

If the matter at issue is covered by [ consumer credit legislation
](/en/money-and-tax/personal-finance/loans-and-credit/borrowing-money-in-
ireland/) , then the person you owe the money to (the creditor) must issue a
notice to you at least 10 days before they take legal action. This notice must
include:

  * Details of the agreement 
  * The name and address of the creditor or owner 
  * Your name and address 
  * The term of the agreement to be enforced and 
  * A statement of the action the creditor intends to take to enforce the agreement, including how and when they intend to take this action 

If the consumer credit legislation does not apply, then it is the usual
practice for creditors to send a 7-day demand letter to you before starting
legal proceedings. This, however, is not always a legal requirement.
