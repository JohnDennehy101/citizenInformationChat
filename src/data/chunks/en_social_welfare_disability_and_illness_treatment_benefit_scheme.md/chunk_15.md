###  EU regulations and Treatment Benefit

If you were previously insurably employed in a country covered by EU
Regulations and you do not qualify on your Irish PRSI record, your social
insurance record in the other EU country may be used to help you qualify for
Treatment Benefit. You must have paid at least one reckonable PRSI
contribution (Classes A, E, H, P and S) since your return to Ireland.
