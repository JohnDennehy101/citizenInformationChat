##  Optical Benefit

The Treatment Benefit Scheme entitles you to a free eyesight test, once every
2 years. However, sight tests for VDUs and [ driving licences ](/en/travel-
and-recreation/motoring/driver-licensing/full-driving-licence/) are not
covered under the scheme.

You can get a [ set payment
](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/600f9e-treatment-benefit-fees-payable/) ,
once every 2 years, towards either one pair each of reading and distance
spectacles, one pair of bifocal or varifocals **or** one pair of contact
lenses (including disposables). Cost will vary depending on the frames you
choose. Basic frames are free.

The examination is provided by [ opticians

](http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/Ophthalmologists-list-page-for-the-website-
