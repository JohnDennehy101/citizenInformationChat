###  Under this scheme, the DSP pays the full cost of an oral examination once
a calendar year.

A payment of €42 towards either a scale and polish or - if clinically
necessary - periodontal treatment, is also available once a calendar year. If
the cost of either cleaning or periodontal treatment is more than €42, you
must pay the balance - capped at €15 for a scale and polish. There is no cap
on the balance charged for periodontal treatment.

Treatment is provided by private dentists who are on the DSP's panel. [ Lists
of dentists on the panel are available from the DSP
](http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/dentists.aspx) . Most dentists are on the
panel, so you should not have any difficulty finding one. The dentist will be
able to check your eligibility and make a claim for you. The claim form will
require details such as your [ Personal Public Service Number (PPS number)
](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/personal-public-service-
number/) , date of birth and signature. If you are a dependent spouse or civil
partner, you should give the PPS number of the insured person, who will also
be required to sign the claim form.
