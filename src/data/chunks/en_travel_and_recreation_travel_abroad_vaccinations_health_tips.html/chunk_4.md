##  When should I start thinking about the vaccines I need?

Start the process of vaccination well before you plan to travel. Some
vaccinations take time to become effective so give yourself at least 8 weeks
to protect yourself fully. An early start to the process is particularly
important if you plan to travel with children. The BCG vaccination against
tuberculosis (TB), for example, should be given at least 3 months before your
child travels.

Certain vaccinations are compulsory. In these cases, you will need to show an
[ International Certificate of Vaccination
](https://apps.who.int/iris/handle/10665/226681) (record of your vaccines) to
gain access to the country in question.

Other vaccinations are recommended, and the decision is left to your own
discretion, however, it makes sense to do everything you can to guard against
illness and disease while you are away.

You will not need vaccinations to visit any European country, unless you have
visited a non-European country shortly beforehand.
