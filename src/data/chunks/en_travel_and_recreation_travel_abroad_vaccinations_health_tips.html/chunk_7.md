##  When you return

If you feel ill following your return to Ireland, make sure that you see a
doctor as soon as possible. Give full details of the countries you visited; in
case this should be relevant.

**Notifiable infectious diseases**

The law in Ireland makes special provisions regarding the reporting of
infectious diseases to the national [ Health Protection Surveillance Centre
](http://www.hpsc.ie/) . As soon as a medical practitioner in Ireland becomes
aware of, or suspects that a person they are attending is suffering from, or
is the carrier of an infectious disease, they are required to transmit a
written or electronic notification to a Medical Officer of Health.

Notification of infectious diseases is necessary to control infectious
diseases. Ireland's Health Protection Surveillance Centre works in partnership
with health service providers and organisations in other countries to ensure
that up-to-date information is available to contribute to the effective
control of infectious diseases.
