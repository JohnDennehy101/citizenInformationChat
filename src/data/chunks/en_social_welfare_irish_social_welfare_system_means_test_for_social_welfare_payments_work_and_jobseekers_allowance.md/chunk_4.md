###  Part 1: Find out if you have an entitlement to Jobseeker’s Allowance

First, you must find out if you have an entitlement to Jobseeker’s Allowance.

To do this take your **assessable weekly earnings** and deduct €20 per day for
each day you have worked up to a maximum of €60 (3 days). Next get 60% of the
balance. This amount is your **weekly means from work** .

Assessable weekly earnings - €20 per day = total x 60% = weekly means from
work.

You then work out what the maximum Jobseeker’s Allowance payment for your
situation would be. You get this by adding together the maximum payment for
yourself plus any increases for a qualified adult and any qualified children.
If your weekly means are less than this figure then your daily means are
calculated to find the **actual** amount of Jobseeker’s Allowance you will
get.

**If your weekly means _from all sources_ are greater ** than the maximum
Jobseeker’s Allowance payment for your situation then you will **not** get
Jobseeker’s Allowance.
