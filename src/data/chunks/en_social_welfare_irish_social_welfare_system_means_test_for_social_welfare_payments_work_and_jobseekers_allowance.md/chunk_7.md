###  Part 2: Calculate how work will affect your Jobseeker’s Allowance

If you are entitled to Jobseeker’s Allowance, you then calculate how work will
affect your payment.

**1\. Calculate your average daily earnings**  
To calculate your average daily earnings get your total **weekly assessable
earnings** from employment and divide by the number of days you worked that
week (including Sunday).

Total weekly earnings ÷ number of days worked = average daily earnings.

**2\. Next calculate your daily means from work  
** To calculate your daily means from work, you must first disregard any
income not taken into account. €20 is not taken into account for days worked.
Next get 60% of the balance. This is assessed as your daily means from work.

Average daily earnings - €20 = total x 60% = daily means from work.

**3\. Finally, find your weekly means from work  
** To find your weekly means from work, multiply your daily means by the
number of days worked.

Daily means from work x number of days worked = **weekly means from work** .

Remember that this figure must be halved if your spouse, civil partner or
cohabitant is getting a social welfare payment in their own right (see above
for details).
