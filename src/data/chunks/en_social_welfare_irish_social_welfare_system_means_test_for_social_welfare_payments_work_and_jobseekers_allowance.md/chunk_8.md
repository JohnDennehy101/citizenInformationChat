###  **Sunday work**

Since 20 February 2013 work on Sunday is included so:

  1. You include your earnings from Sunday when working out your assessable weekly earnings and when you are checking to see whether your assessable weekly earnings are over the limit 
  2. You include Sunday when calculating your average daily earnings and when calculating your daily means or weekly means from work 

**Public holidays**

If you work part-time, your employer must pay you for the [ public holidays
](/en/employment/employment-rights-and-conditions/leave-and-holidays/public-
holidays/) which you don’t work, as long as, you have worked at least 40 hours
in the 5 weeks immediately before the week of the public holiday. If you are
paid for a public holiday (whether you work on that day or not) this is
counted as a day of work. If you are claiming a jobseeker’s payment for a
period which includes a public holiday and you do not qualify for a payment
from your employer, then you can qualify for a jobseeker’s payment for that
day.

If you get paid for a public holiday and don't work that day, it will be
included in the number of days worked to find your weekly means from work.
Depending on your means, you can continue to get Jobseeker’s Allowance for the
other days you do not work. If you work more than 3 days in a week you do not
qualify for JA for that week.
