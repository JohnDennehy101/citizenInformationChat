####  What happens if my partner is getting a social welfare payment?

If your spouse, civil partner or cohabitant has a social welfare payment in
their own right (except Child Benefit, Disablement Pension, [ guardian's
payments ](/en/social-welfare/death-related-benefits/guardian-and-orphan-
payments/) , [ Supplementary Welfare Allowance ](/en/social-
welfare/supplementary-welfare-schemes/supplementary-welfare-allow/) , [
Domiciliary Care Allowance ](/en/social-welfare/disability-and-
illness/domiciliary-care-allowance/) and [ half-rate Carer's Allowance
](/en/social-welfare/carers/half-rate-carers-allowance/) ) or is on a FET or
VTOS course and getting a payment in their own right you **cannot** claim an
Increase for a Qualified Adult for them.

This means that the maximum you can be paid is the maximum Jobseeker’s
Allowance payment for a single person plus a half-rate allowance for each
qualified child. (Your spouse, civil partner or cohabitant will get a half-
rate payment for each qualified child with their payment.)

In addition only 50% of your combined means are taken into account in the
means test for your Jobseeker’s Allowance - in other words **your combined
means are halved** . (The other half will be taken into account in the means
test for your partner's payment if your partner is getting a means-tested
payment.)

However, if you are claiming Jobseeker's Allowance and your spouse or partner
is getting one of the social welfare payments listed below, the total amount
paid cannot be more than would be payable if only one of you was claiming and
the other was an adult dependant.

  * Jobseeker's Allowance 
  * Farm Assist 
  * Illness Benefit 
  * Disablement Pension (when paid with Injury Benefit or Incapacity Supplement) 
  * Injury Benefit 
  * Invalidity Pension 
  * State Pension (Non-Contributory) 
  * State Pension (Contributory) 
  * State Pension (Transition) 
  * Jobseeker's Benefit
