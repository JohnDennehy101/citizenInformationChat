###  All other employment permits

Your spouse or de facto partner, and dependent children can apply to come to
Ireland at the end of a 12 month waiting period. You must be earning enough
money to support your family. If you have children, the levels of income that
are used for qualifying for [ Working Family Payment ](/en/social-
welfare/families-and-children/working-family-payment/) are used to determine
if you have the required salary.

If you have no children, then you must earn at least â‚¬30,000 per year for your
spouse or partner to join you in Ireland.
