##  Introduction

If you have moved to Ireland to work with an employment permit, your family
can apply to join you.

For [ Critical Skills Employment Permit holders ](/en/moving-country/working-
in-ireland/employment-permits/green-card-permits/) and doctors with a Stamp
1H, family members can join you in Ireland immediately. For [ General
Employment Permits ](/en/moving-country/working-in-ireland/employment-
permits/work-permits/) and [ other employment permits ](/en/moving-
country/working-in-ireland/employment-permits/overview-employment-permits/) ,
your family can apply to join you after one year.

Family member means spouse or de facto partner, and dependent children. A de
facto partner is a person you are in a committed relationship with that is
like a marriage, but you are not married to each other.

Other family members may be allowed to join you in Ireland in limited
situations.

In most cases, you must be able to show that you can support your family.

If your family are granted a visa (if they need one) to enter Ireland, they
may still need their own employment permit to work.
