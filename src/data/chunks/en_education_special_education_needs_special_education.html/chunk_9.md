###  **Individual education plans**

The [ EPSEN Act 2004
](https://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2004/act/30/section/3/enacted/en/html)
says each child with a special educational need should have an individual
education plan. However, the relevant section of the Act has yet to be
commenced, so there is currently no legal entitlement for students to have
these plans. Some teachers may use their own form of individual education plan
when teaching students with special educational needs.

National Council for Special Education (NCSE).
