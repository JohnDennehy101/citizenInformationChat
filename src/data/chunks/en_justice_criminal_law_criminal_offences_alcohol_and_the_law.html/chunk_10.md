##  Drinking outdoors

Drinking outdoors is not prohibited in general. However, many city and county
councils have bye-laws that forbid drinking in some or all public places.

The Gardaí can confiscate alcohol if you are drinking in public and behaving
in a way that could cause worry for safety. They can also confiscate alcohol
if it is being drunk by a person under 18, or where they have cause to believe
that it will be consumed by a person under 18.

It is an [ offence to consume alcohol bought in a closed container (like a
bottle or can) within 100 metres

of the off-licence where it was sold. The law does not forbid a pub from
delivering drinks to people’s homes, or allowing customers to bring drinks
home.

It is also an [ offence to be so drunk in a public place

that you could reasonably be assumed to be a danger to yourself or to anyone
around you.
