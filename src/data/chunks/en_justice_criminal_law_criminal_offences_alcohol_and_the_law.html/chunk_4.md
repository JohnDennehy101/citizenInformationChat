###  Types of alcohol licences

There are a number of types of licences with different conditions attached.

An _Ordinary Publicans On Licence_ allows the licence holder to sell alcoholic
drinks on the premises during regular opening hours. A new application for
this licence must be lodged with the [ Circuit Court ](/en/justice/courts-
system/circuit-court/) .

A _Special Exemption Order_ allows the licence holder to serve alcoholic
drinks outside of ordinary opening hours. The latest time that alcohol can be
served for drinking on the premises is 2:30am. Applications for this exemption
must be lodged at the local [ District Court ](/en/justice/courts-
system/district-court/) .

A _Public Music and Singing License and/or Public Dancing Licence_ is required
if the venue has live music or the venue is operating as a nightclub or disco.
This licence is granted by the local District Court.

A _Restaurant Certificate_ entitles pubs that serve a substantial meal (one
that costs more than €9) to serve alcohol one hour after normal opening hours
if it accompanies that meal. A _Limited Restaurant Certificate_ allows a
limited part of a pub to have the same exemption.

A _Wine Retailer’s On Licence_ is for ‘refreshment houses’ and allows for the
sale of wine, sherry and other liquors containing less than 23% alcohol.

An _Occasional Licence_ is used for events that take place in a venue or
premises that normally does not serve alcohol. It can only be granted to the
holder of an existing licence. This licence is applied for at the local
District Court.
