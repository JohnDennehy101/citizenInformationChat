##  How does the GP out-of-hours service work?

You must make an appointment to use the GP out-of-hours service. There is no
drop-in facility.

The out-of-hours service is available at night and on weekends.

If you phone your GP outside normal working hours, you will usually get a
recorded message with the contact details for your local GP out-of-hours
service. The Health Service Executive (HSE) website also provides [ a list of
phone numbers for the out-of-hours service.

When you ring the GP out-of-hours service, you will first speak to a nurse
about your (or your childâ€™s) symptoms. The nurse will clinically assess
whether you need:

  * Nursing advice over the phone 
  * An appointment with a GP 
  * A house call 
  * A referral to the Emergency Department (A & E) 
  * Or an ambulance 

If the nurse decides that you need to see the out-of-hours doctor (GP), they
will give you an appointment.
