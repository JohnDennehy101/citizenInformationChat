##  How to qualify for the One-Parent Family Payment

To qualify for the One-Parent Family Payment (OFP) you must:

  * Be aged under 66 
  * Be the parent, step-parent, adoptive parent or legal guardian of a child under a certain age (see ‘Age limit for a child’ below) 
  * Be the main carer of at least one child under the age limit. The child must live with you. OFP is not paid if the parents have joint equal custody of a child or children. 
  * Pass a means test. A means test looks at any income you have (see ‘How your income is assessed for the One-Parent Family Payment’ below) 
  * Live in Ireland and meet the [ habitual residence condition ](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/social-assistance-payments/habitual-residence-condition/) (read about [ exemptions from the habitual residency condition ](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/social-assistance-payments/habitual-residence-condition/) ) 
  * Not be living with a spouse, civil partner or [ cohabiting ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/birth-family-relationships/cohabiting-couples/rights-of-cohabiting-couples/#e6e823)

If you are **separated** , **divorced** or **your civil partnership is
