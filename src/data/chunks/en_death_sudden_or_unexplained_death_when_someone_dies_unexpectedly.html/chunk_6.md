##  Inquests

If a death cannot be explained by a postmortem examination, an [ inquest
](/en/death/sudden-or-unexplained-death/inquests-and-inquest-reports/) must be
held to establish the facts of the death, such as where and how the death
occurred. Where an inquest is to be held, the Coroner is usually able to allow
[ burial ](/en/death/practical-arrangements-after-a-death/burials-and-burial-
grounds/) or [ cremation ](/en/death/practical-arrangements-after-a-
death/cremations/) once the postmortem examination of the body has been
completed.

For some deaths, inquests are legally required. In other cases, the holding of
an inquest is at the discretion of the Coroner and the family can make their
views known to the Coroner, if they so wish.

The inquest will not take place until at least 6 weeks after the death. It is
a public enquiry, presided over by the Coroner (and in some cases involving a
jury) into the cause of the death. Witnesses may be required to attend the
inquest to give evidence regarding the circumstances and cause of the death.
The family are entitled to attend the inquest, but they are not legally
obliged to be there.

When a jury is present at an inquest, it is the jury rather than the Coroner
who delivers the verdict. Nobody is found guilty or innocent at an inquest and
no criminal or civil liability is determined.
