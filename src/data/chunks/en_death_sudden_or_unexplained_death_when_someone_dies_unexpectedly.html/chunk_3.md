##  Identification of the body

If the Coroner decides a postmortem examination is needed, then a family
member may be asked to formally identify the body. They are required to go to
the mortuary and identify the body to a Garda who is acting on behalf of the
Coroner. The Garda√≠ may require more information about the circumstances
surrounding the death.

Identification may sometimes be confirmed by a photograph or other means. In
such cases a family member is not required to view the body.

Where a Coroner has ordered a postmortem examination, the permission of the
family is not necessary.
