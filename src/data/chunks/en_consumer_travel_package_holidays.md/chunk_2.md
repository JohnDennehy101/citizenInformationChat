##  Booking a package holiday

Travel organisers must give you information about the type of holiday you are
buying. Travel organisers can be a tour operator or an offline travel agency.

Your travel organiser must tell you up front if you are buying a package
holiday **or** a linked travel arrangement â€“ explained below. To check what
type of holiday you have booked, read the information you got before you
booked or call your travel organiser.
