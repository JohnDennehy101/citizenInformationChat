###  Making a complaint when you get home

If you are not satisfied that the complaint has been dealt with properly when
you return from the holiday, you must complain in writing to the travel
organiser. You must do this **within 28 days** from the end of the holiday.

If the travel organiser does not respond within a reasonable time, you should
send a second letter of complaint. If you are still not happy with your travel
organiser's response, you can get advice from the [ Competition and Consumer
Protection Commission (CCPC) ](http://www.ccpc.ie) .

The CCPC has specific powers to oversee the enforcement of Irish law covering
package holidays and to identify legal breaches (that is, misleading
advertising and or inaccurate brochures). The CCPC cannot bring proceedings on
your behalf.

If the organiser refuses to offer any compensation, you can use:

  * The [ small claims court ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/justice/courts-system/small-claims-court/) (for travel organisers based in Ireland and claims up to €2,000) 
  * The [ European small claims procedure ](/en/justice/courts-system/european-small-claims-procedure/) (for travel organisers based elsewhere in the EU/EEA and claims up to €5,000) 
  * [ Arbitration ](https://www.ciarb.ie/services/arbitration.233.html) through the Travel Scheme. Arbitration is where parties agree to refer their dispute to an independent third party for resolution. You can find out more about the Travel Scheme on the [ website of the Chartered Institute of Arbitrators – Ireland Branch (CIArb) ](https://www.ciarb.ie/adr-schemes/itaa.314.html) . 
  * Use out-of-court procedures such as the [ European Consumer Centre (ECC) Ireland ](https://eur03.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eccireland.ie%2F&data=05%7C02%7CSimone.Hughes%40ciboard.ie%7Ccc0c4285e1b64a78b43408dc62ac8591%7Cbb4e61ce39a3414abb5d6a0290c95fd9%7C0%7C0%7C638493740312917735%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=QRHyoM57V02UsOoXcW%2BdxE78lLq5yl0yWoWe4gBjdvo%3D&reserved=0) (for cross-border disputes only) and [ Online Dispute Resolution ](/en/consumer/how-to-complain/online-dispute-resolution/) (for national and cross-border online disputes).
