##  Types of package holidays

Package holidays can be ready-made **or** customised packages. A package
holiday is sold at a total or inclusive price, must last for more than 24
hours, or include an overnight stay. It does not matter if you are asked to
pay separately for different parts of the package (such as, the flight or
transport), your holiday is still a ‘package holiday’.
