###  Rights if something goes wrong while on your holiday

If something goes wrong with your holiday, the travel organiser must put the
problem right. If significant parts of the holiday are not as agreed, you must
be offered suitable alternative arrangements. For example, if the
accommodation you agreed on and booked is no longer available, you must be
offered an alternative that is of the same quality.

If the travel organiser does not provide solutions (also known as _remedies)_
within a reasonable period, they should refund you for any necessary expenses
you had to pay. You are also entitled to a price reduction or, if you prefer,
to end the contract. You may be entitled to compensation for inconvenience.
