##  What are linked travel arrangements?

Linked travel arrangements (LTAs) are not considered a package holiday and
different rules apply - see ‘Rules for your travel contract and your rights’
below. In fact, you have fewer rights with LTAs.

With an LTA, you buy 2 or more travel services from different companies under
separate contracts but which are linked. For example, you book a flight on a
website and you are then invited, through a targeted link, to book a hotel on
a different website.

You make a linked travel arrangement if you:

  1. Book and complete buying one travel service on one website 
  2. Are invited, through a targeted link, to ‘click through’ and to book a second service on another website 
  3. Conclude the second contract on the second website within 24 hours of the first booking 

When the second booking is made:

  * You **must** be told you are not booking a package and, therefore, you can claim insolvency protection only (protection that will cover you if your travel organiser goes out of business) 
  * The second company must tell the first company that you have finished booking the second service
