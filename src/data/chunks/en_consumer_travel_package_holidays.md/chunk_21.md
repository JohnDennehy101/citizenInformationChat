###  If the travel organiser cancels the holiday

If the travel organiser cancels the package holiday or changes a term of the
contract, including the price or type of accommodation, they must give you the
option of **one** of the following:

  * A replacement holiday of the same or better quality 
  * A lower grade holiday, with a refund of the difference in price 
  * A full refund within 14 days 

The travel organiser has the right to cancel the package due to factors out of
their control. Examples include an act of God, or where they didnâ€™t get the
number of people they needed for the package holiday.
