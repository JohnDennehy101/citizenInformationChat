###  Right to transfer your contract

You can transfer your holiday to another person once you give the travel
organiser reasonable written notice (at least seven days) before the start of
the package. You and the person you transfer the package holiday to are
responsible for paying the balance of money due to the travel organiser. You
are also responsible for any other costs the organiser has to pay to carry out
the transfer.
