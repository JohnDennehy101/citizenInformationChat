###  Rights for linked travel arrangements

A linked travel arrangement (LTA) is not considered a travel package, and your
rights are limited if travelling using these arrangements.

You are only protected if the provider of the **first** service goes out of
business. In this case, you are entitled to your money back and the cost of
bringing you home if necessary (repatriation). This is sometimes called
_insolvency protection_ .

When you make the second booking under an LTA, you must be told that:

  * You are not booking a package 
  * Your rights are limited to claiming insolvency protection
