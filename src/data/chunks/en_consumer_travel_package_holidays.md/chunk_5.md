###  Customised packages

A customised package (sometimes called a dynamic packages) is where you choose
the different parts of your holiday â€“ therefore, it is not a ready-made
holiday. You buy the customised package online through a website, or offline
from a travel agent or call centre. All the parts you buy must relate to the
same trip or holiday.

A customised package must include either:

  * A single contract for all services 

or

  * Separate contracts with different travel service providers, where: 
    * All of the contracts are bought from a single point of sale 
    * All services are selected before you agree to pay 
    * There is a total or inclusive price
