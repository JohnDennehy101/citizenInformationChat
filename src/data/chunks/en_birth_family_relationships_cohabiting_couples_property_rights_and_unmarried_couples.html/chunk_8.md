##  Local authority housing

Cohabiting couples can apply for local authority housing (also called _social
housing_ ). Local authority housing is generally allocated based on your need
for housing and whether you can afford to pay for your own accommodation.

You and your partner can apply for the allocation of a house to be held in
joint tenancy (see above).

If you move in to a local authority house where your partner is already the
sole tenant, you can apply for joint tenancy **after 2 years** .
