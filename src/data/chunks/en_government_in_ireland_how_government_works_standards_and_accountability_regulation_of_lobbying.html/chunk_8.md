##  How to register

Since 1 September 2015, if you are carrying on lobbying activities you must
register at [ lobbying.ie ](https://www.lobbying.ie/) . You are not required
to register before you begin lobbying. If you start lobbying between:

  * 1 September and 31 December, you must register by 21 January

  * 1 May and 31 August, you must register by 21 September 

You must provide the following information when registering:

  * Your name, if you are lobbying in a personal capacity, or the name of your company or organisation 
  * The address (or principal address) at which you carry on business or (if there is no such address) the address at which you normally live 
  * Your business or main activities 
  * Any e-mail address, telephone number or website address relating to your business or main activities 
  * Any registration number issued to you by the Companies Registration Office 

You must also make returns about your lobbying activities during each of the
above periods within 21 days of the end of the period. You have to provide the
following:

  * Where the lobbying was carried out on behalf of someone else, information about that person 
  * The designated public officials who were lobbied and the public body by which they are employed or in which they hold any office or other position

If there has been no lobbying activity during the period, your return must

indicates that you have permanently ceased to carry on lobbying activities.
