##  Introduction

Lobbying involves making views known to politicians and public servants about
laws, policies and practices as well as potentially seeking to have those
laws, policies and practices changed. Lobbying takes many different forms. You
may make your views known as a private citizen on issues that directly affect
you, or you may present views on issues that affect other groups of people.
You may lobby in person, get someone else to lobby on your behalf or lobby
through writing.

The [ Regulation of Lobbying Act 2015
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2015/act/5/enacted/en/html) provides that
people who are lobbying must register with the [ Standards in Public Office
Commission ](http://www.sipo.gov.ie/en/) . They must also provide information
about their lobbying activities. It also provides a code of conduct for
lobbying activities and introduces a “cooling-off” period during which some
former officials may not do any lobbying.

You can access the [ Register of Lobbying
](https://www.lobbying.ie/app/Organisation/Search?currentPage=0&pageSize=10&queryText=&subjectMatters=&subjectMatterAreas=&lobbyingActivities=&period=&returnDateFrom=&returnDateTo=&client=)
on [ lobbying.ie ](https://www.lobbying.ie/) .

There is no charge to register as a lobbyist or to view the Register of
Lobbying.
