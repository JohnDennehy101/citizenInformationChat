####  **Financial matters**

In a marriage, there is a legal responsibility on both spouses to maintain
each other and any children in accordance with their means. This means that
any settlement agreed or imposed by the court should include a [ maintenance
agreement ](/en/birth-family-relationships/separation-and-divorce/maintenance-
orders-and-agreements/) . The issue of what happens to the [ family home
](/en/birth-family-relationships/separation-and-divorce/family-and-shared-
home/) also arises.

Separation or divorce may have tax implications. It is important to understand
the [ different taxation options available ](/en/money-and-tax/tax/income-tax-
credits-and-reliefs/separation-divorce-and-tax-reliefs/) and [ how maintenance
payments affect taxation ](/en/money-and-tax/tax/income-tax-credits-and-
reliefs/maintenance-and-tax/) . You may need to get specialist tax advice
before entering into arrangements that have [ capital gains tax implications
](/en/money-and-tax/tax/capital-taxes/capital-taxes-following-separation-or-
divorce/) .
