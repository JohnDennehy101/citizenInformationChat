##  Cohabiting relationships

The [ rights of cohabiting couples ](/en/birth-family-
relationships/cohabiting-couples/rights-of-cohabiting-couples/) are in general
not recognised in Irish law. If the relationship breaks down, this has
important implications for such things as [ property ownership ](/en/birth-
family-relationships/problems-in-marriages-and-other-relationships/property-
rights-and-the-breakdown-of-a-cohabiting-relationship/) . There is a [ redress
scheme for cohabiting couples ](/en/birth-family-relationships/problems-in-
marriages-and-other-relationships/redress-scheme-for-cohabiting-couples/) who
have been in a long-term relationship or who have had children.
