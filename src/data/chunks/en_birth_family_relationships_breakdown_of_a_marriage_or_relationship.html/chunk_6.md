##  Civil partnerships

The [ options available to those in civil partnerships ](/en/birth-family-
relationships/separation-and-divorce/getting-a-dissolution/) where there is a
breakdown in the relationship are similar to those available to married
couples. The courts are able to grant a [ decree of nullity of civil
partnership ](/en/birth-family-relationships/civil-partnerships/nullity-of-
civil-partnership/) in broadly the same way as decrees of nullity of marriage
are granted. The courts are also able to [ dissolve civil partnerships
](/en/birth-family-relationships/separation-and-divorce/getting-a-
dissolution/) in a similar way to the granting of divorce, but the rules
governing the dissolution of civil partnerships are different.
