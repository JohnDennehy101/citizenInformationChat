##  Taking legal action

If your engagement has ended and you want to take legal action, you must do it
within 3 years.

Such cases are usually heard in the [ Circuit Court ](/en/justice/courts-
system/circuit-court/) . However, if very valuable property is involved, you
may ask that it be heard in the [ High Court. ](/en/justice/courts-
system/high-court/)

If you want to take legal action regarding significant gifts from a third
party or expenses related to wedding preparations, you can go to the [
District Court ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/justice/courts-
system/district-court/) if the amount of compensation is less than â‚¬15,000.
