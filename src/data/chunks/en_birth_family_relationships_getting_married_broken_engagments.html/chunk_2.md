##  Introduction

Most couples get engaged before they get married.

If the engagement is broken (called off) and there is a dispute between the
couple over property or finances, the [ Family Law Act 1981
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1981/en/act/pub/0022/index.html) allows them
to take legal action against each other. The Act also allows an involved third
party (such as a family member) to take legal action.

Before the Family Law Act 1981 came into effect, an engagement was considered
a legally binding contract. This meant that, if the engagement was broken
without a lawful reason, the person responsible for breaking off the
engagement (breaking the contract) could be sued for damages for breach of
promise. Since the 1981 Act, you cannot take legal action for breach of
promise following a broken engagement.
