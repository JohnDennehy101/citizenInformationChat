###  **Proof of course and change of circumstances**

You must provide a certificate from the school or college confirming your
registration, commencement, and attendance at the course. You must give this
information to the Department of Social Protection (DSP) before your BTEA
payment can start.

During the academic year, you may be asked to prove that you are still taking
part in the course.

If you change from a jobseeker's payment to BTEA, you do not need to [ sign on
