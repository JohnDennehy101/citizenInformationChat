allowance-bte1/) . You can also get a copy of the form from your local Intreo
centre.

Your qualifying payment determines [ where you should send your application
form for BTEA ](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/5afe0f-operational-
guidelines-back-to-education-allowance/#appendix-1) .

For example, if you are getting a jobseeker's payment, Farm Assist or a One-
Parent Family payment, you should return your application form to [ your local
Intreo Centre ](http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/List-of-Social-Welfare-Local-
and-Branch-Offices-by-County.aspx) .

But, if you are getting Illness Benefit, you should send your application form
to the Illness Benefit section of the DSP.
