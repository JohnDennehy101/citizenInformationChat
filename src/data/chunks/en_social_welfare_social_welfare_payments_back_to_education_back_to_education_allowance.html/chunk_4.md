##  Study options for BTEA

There are 2 study options available under the BTEA scheme:

  * Further Level Education option 
  * Higher Level Education option 

Your course must lead to a [ Quality and Qualifications Ireland (QQI)
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/education/third-level-
education/colleges-and-qualifications/fet-qualifications/) accreditation
(including FETAC or HETAC awards), or equivalent. You must also progress in
educational qualifications.

For example, if you already have a Level 6 qualification on the National
Framework of Qualifications, the course you attend must be for at least a
Level 7 qualification. This progression rule has been relaxed for people
applying for Further Education Level courses at Levels 5 and 6 in limited
circumstances.

For example, if you already hold a Level 5 or 6 qualification, your Employment
Personal Advisor or Job Coach may recommend a course at the same or lesser
level if:

  * You have worked for at least 3 years and paid PRSI contributions 
  * You got your previous qualification 3 or more years ago and it is no longer relevant in the current job market 
  * The proposed course will let you progress your career, and it meets future skills needs or local demand 
  * The proposed course lasts no more than 24 months
