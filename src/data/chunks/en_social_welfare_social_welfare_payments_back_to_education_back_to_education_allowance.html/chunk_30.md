To apply for BTEA, you must:

  * Complete the [ Back to Education Allowance application form (BTE1) (pdf) ](https://www.gov.ie/en/form/92351d-back-to-education-allowance-bte1/)
  * Be recommended for BTEA by a DSP Employment Personal Advisor or Job Coach (if you are a jobseeker making a new BTEA claim) 
  * Get written confirmation that you are registered as a full-time day student from the college registrar or admission officer
