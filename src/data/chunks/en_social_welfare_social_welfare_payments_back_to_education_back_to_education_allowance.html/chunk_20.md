####  **Change of circumstances**

If your circumstances change (for example, if you stop attending your course
or start working part-time), you must tell the DSP immediately.

Any change of circumstance may affect:

  * Whether you are eligible for your qualifying payment, or 
  * The value of your BTEA payment
