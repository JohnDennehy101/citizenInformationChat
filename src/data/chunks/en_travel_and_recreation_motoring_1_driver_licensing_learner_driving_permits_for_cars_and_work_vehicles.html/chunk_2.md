##  Introduction

A learner permit is a document issued by the [ National Driver Licensing
Service (NDLS) ](https://www.ndls.ie/index.php) . It allows you to learn to
drive on public roads in Ireland and you must always have it with you when you
are driving.

cases, you cannot take a driving test until you have had your first learner
permit for [ at least 6 months ](https://www.rsa.ie/en/RSA/Learner-
