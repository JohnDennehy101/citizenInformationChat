###  **Rules**

While driving with a learner permit, you must:

  * Always be accompanied by someone with a current driving licence for the same category of drawing vehicle plus trailer (and they must have had their driving licence for at least 2 years). 
  * Always display L plates to the front and rear of the vehicle you are driving. The plate should show a red L on a white background and should be at least 15cm high with a border of at least 2cm. 

While driving with a learner permit, you must not:

  * Drive on a motorway 
  * Act as an accompanying driver for that category 
  * Carry other people for reward or payment 

The drink driving limit for drivers with trailers with learner permits or full
driving licences is 20mg per 100ml of blood. Further information on [ drink
driving limits ](https://www.drinkdriversdestroylives.ie/drink-driving-fast-
facts/) is available from the RSA.

Finally, remember that the maximum speed limit for a vehicle towing a trailer
is 80km/h, and this also applies on roads where the posted road sign speed
limit is higher. As always drivers are subject to the lowest posted speed sign
so it will not always be possible to travel at 80km/h.

Read the [ rules of the road ](https://www.rsa.ie/services/learner-
drivers/resources/rules-of-the-road) for more information.
