###  **Supporting documents**

If you (and your spouse, civil partner, or cohabitant) were born and married
in Ireland, you donâ€™t need to send your birth or marriage certificates. The
DSP already has access to this information.

However, if the marriage, civil partnership, or birth took place outside of
Ireland, you must provide an original copy of the birth certificates or
marriage certificate. The DSP does not accept photocopies.

If you are claiming an increase for a qualified child who is aged 18-22 and in
full-time education, you should also provide a letter from their college
confirming their attendance.
