##  Cross-border workers

If you are [ resident ](/en/money-and-tax/tax/moving-country-and-taxation/tax-
residence-and-domicile-in-ireland/) in Ireland and commute daily or weekly to
your place of work in another country where you pay tax, then you may qualify
for Trans-border Workers Relief. This reduces your tax in Ireland to take
account of the tax that you have paid abroad. It does this by reducing the tax
you pay in Ireland on your total income so that it is in proportion to the
amount of income from Irish sources.

For example, take the case where your total income was €50,000, of which
€5,000 was earned in Ireland and the remainder (€45,000) was earned and taxed
abroad.

The proportion of your total income that is Irish income is 1/10 (5,000
divided by 50,000).

Your Irish income tax liability is calculated as usual on the full amount of
your income, €50,000.

But under Trans-border Workers Relief, this amount of tax is then divided by
ten to give the tax that you have to pay in Ireland.

There are certain conditions on the duration and place of employment. [ More
