##  Working from home

You may be able to claim tax relief on additional costs of working from home,
including electricity, heating and broadband.

Your employer can pay you a contribution towards these costs or you can make a
claim for tax relief during the year or after the end of the year. [ Read more

The cost of items you buy, such as office equipment, is not eligible for
Remote Working Relief.

If your employer provides you with equipment for business use, it is not taxed
as a benefit-in-kind.
