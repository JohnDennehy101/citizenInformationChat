###  Paying PRSI contributions when youâ€™re sick

You do not pay PRSI contributions if your employer does not pay you when you
are sick. But, if you are getting [ Illness Benefit ](/en/social-
welfare/disability-and-illness/illness-benefit/) , [ Injury Benefit
](/en/social-welfare/disability-and-illness/injury-benefit/) and [ Invalidity
Pension ](/en/social-welfare/disability-and-illness/invalidity-pension/) , you
can get [ credited contributions ](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-
system/social-insurance-prsi/credited-social-insurance-contributions/) .

If your employer pays you when you are sick, you will continue paying PRSI.
Read about your entitlements to [ sick leave and sick pay
](/en/employment/employment-rights-and-conditions/leave-and-holidays/sick-
leave-and-sick-pay/) .

Your employer may continue to pay you while you are out sick if you give them
any Illness Benefit you get from the DSP. In this case, your employer only
pays a PRSI contribution on the amount of sick pay, minus the amount of
Illness Benefit.

If your employer pays you when you are sick and allows you to keep your
Illness Benefit, your employer pays a PRSI contribution on the full amount of
the sick pay, ignoring the Illness Benefit payment.
