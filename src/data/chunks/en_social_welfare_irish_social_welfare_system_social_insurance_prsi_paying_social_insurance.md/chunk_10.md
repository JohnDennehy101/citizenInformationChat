###  Example: Working temporarily in the EU

For example, if you are employed in Ireland and your employer sends you to
work temporarily in another [ EU state
](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/3df362-operational-guidelines-prsi-prsi-
special-collection-system/#scheme-of-posted-workers) , you will continue to
pay PRSI under the Irish system for 24 months.

If you are going to work in Europe for a short time, you need an [ A1
Certificate ](https://www.gov.ie/en/service/c65bb-a1-certificates-social-
insurance-in-europe/) (formerly E101 Form) to show where you will pay your
social insurance. Your employer (or you, if you are self-employed) should
apply for an A1 Certificate at least 4 weeks before you start work in another
EU country. You can apply on the [ Welfare Partners platform
](https://www.welfarepartners.ie/Account/Login) .
