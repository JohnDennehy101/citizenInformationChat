##  Where can I see my PRSI record?

Your employer deducts your PRSI contribution from your wages. By law, you are
entitled to inspect the PRSI record kept by your employer about you. You can
also get a statement of your record from your employer every 3 months.

You can access your [ Employment Detail Summary ](/en/employment/employment-
rights-and-conditions/pay-and-employment/employment-detail-summary/) online
through [ Revenue’s myAccount service ](https://www.ros.ie/myaccount-
web/sign_in.html?execution=e1s1) . This has details of your pay, as well as
the PRSI, [ income tax ](/en/money-and-tax/tax/income-tax/how-your-tax-is-
calculated/) , and [ Universal Social Charge (USC) ](/en/money-and-
tax/tax/income-tax/universal-social-charge/) that has been deducted by your
employer and paid to Revenue over the year.

You can also request a copy of your complete [ PRSI record online at
MyWelfare.ie ](https://services.mywelfare.ie/en/topics/statements-refunds-and-
repayments/contribution-statement/) . If you have difficulty using this online
facility, you can contact the PRSI Records customer service team for
assistance (see ‘More information’ below).
