##  If PRSI contributions are unpaid or incorrect

If your employer does not make the correct PRSI contribution, they will be
held responsible for the cost of the entire contribution, and any arrears that
may be due. Unpaid PRSI can be recovered in court as a debt to the State.

If your employer does not make PRSI contributions on your behalf, they may
need to repay the DSP certain social welfare payments, which you may have
received illegally while working for them. These benefits include:

  * Illness Benefit 
  * Jobseeker's Benefit 
  * Jobseeker's Allowance 
  * Pre-Retirement Allowance 
  * Invalidity Pension 
  * Working Family Payment 

Your employer may also be responsible for:

  * Any benefit you have lost because they didnâ€™t pay PRSI contributions on your behalf 
  * The repayment of social welfare assistance paid to you in lieu of lost benefit
