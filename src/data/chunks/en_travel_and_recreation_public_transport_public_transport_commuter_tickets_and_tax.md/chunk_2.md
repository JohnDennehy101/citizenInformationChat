##  Introduction

The Taxsaver Commuter Ticket Scheme reduces the cost of using public
transport. Employers can make PRSI savings of up to 10.75%. Employees can save
between 28.5% and 52% of travel costs due to tax, PRSI and USC savings. The
ticket covers [ bus ](/en/travel-and-recreation/public-transport/bus-services-
in-ireland/) , [ rail ](/en/travel-and-recreation/public-transport/rail-
services-in-ireland/) , and the [ Luas tram system ](/en/travel-and-
recreation/public-transport/luas/) .

You can talk to your employer about participating in the scheme. Your employer
will then apply and buy your ticket. Employees cannot apply for the scheme or
buy the ticket themselves.

The Taxsaver scheme is run (in conjunction with the [ Revenue Commissioners
](http://www.revenue.ie/) ) by:

  * Dublin Bus 
  * Bus Éireann 
  * Luas 
  * Irish Rail 
  * Approved transport providers 

Employees can get tickets as part of their salary package (salary sacrifice)
instead of an annual cash bonus or as a benefit-in-kind.

Taxsaver tickets are not subject to tax, PRSI or USC. Employees must only pay
tax, PRSI, and USC on the ‘money’ portion of their salary. Employer PRSI is
also calculated on the ‘money’ portion of the employee's salary.
