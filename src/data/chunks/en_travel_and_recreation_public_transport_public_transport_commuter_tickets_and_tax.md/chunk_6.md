###  Contract between employer and employee

Employees who want to join the TaxSaver scheme [ select the ticket
](https://www.taxsaver.ie/Ticket-Types/) type they need. Employers and
employees then sign a contract setting out the terms of the Taxsaver scheme.
The Taxsaver contract (between the employer and employee) must be agreed upon
and signed before the employer applies for a Taxsaver ticket. Both parties
must review the conditions of the contract. For example, the contract should
state what happens if an employee leaves the company before the ticket expiry
date.

A signed Taxsaver contract usually lasts for 12 months. If, for example, an
employee goes on holiday during that time, they cannot return the ticket, or
get a refund for the time spent away and reclaim the ticket upon returning.

If an employee returns a ticket to an employer before the 12 months is up,
they can rejoin the scheme again after the 12-months have expired. However,
the company may get a refund for the portion of the year not used by the
employee.

Tickets are strictly non-transferable and cannot be exchanged for cash
benefits.

Once a contract between the employer and employee has been signed, the
employer applies the tax conditions set out below and applies to the relevant
transport provider.
