###  Taxsaver payment options

Employees can participate in the scheme in one of 3 ways:

**Salary sacrifice**

Employees can get TaxSaver commuter tickets as part of their basic salary
package by choosing salary sacrifice.

**Example of salary sacrifice**

If the annual cost of a bus and rail ticket is €1,800 and an employee earns
€30,000 per annum: Instead of buying the ticket for €1,800, the employee can
agree to a ‘salary sacrifice’. So, their salary is reduced by €1,800 a year,
or €34.62 per week, to cover the cost of the annual ticket (€1,800 divided by
52 weeks).

The employee will not be charged tax, PRSI, or USC on the portion of salary
they sacrificed (€1,800). Instead, they only pay tax, PRSI and USC on €28,200.
(€30,000 minus €1,800).

The employer will claim an expense for salary paid to employees.

If an assumed 10.75% rate applies, the employer PRSI would be €3,031.5.
(10.75% of €28,200).

The employer will pay and claim €28,200 salary (plus employer PRSI) using
salary sacrifice. This comes to €3,031.5 (this is where the employer saves),
plus a deduction of €1,800 (the cost of the ticket).

The cost of the ticket is now regarded as an allowable expense for Section 118
(5A) of the Tax Consolidation Act 1997 as amended by [ Section 8 of the
Finance Act 2005
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2005/en/act/pub/0005/sec0008.html#parti-
chapii-sec8) .

**Example without salary sacrifice**

The employer will pay €30,000 in salary and claim an expense of €30,000 (plus
the employer PRSI). The employer PRSI would be €3,225. (10.75% of €30,000).

**Cash Bonus**

As an alternative to salary sacrifice, an employer can offer employees
TaxSaver commuter tickets instead of a cash bonus. As cash bonuses are taxed
and commuter tickets are not, tickets provide better value to employees than
cash bonuses.

**Benefits-in-kind**

A third way for employers and employees to benefit from the scheme is for
employers to offer employees TaxSaver commuter tickets as a benefit-in-kind.
For example, instead of a parking space at work, or as an incentive for an
employee to stay with the company.
