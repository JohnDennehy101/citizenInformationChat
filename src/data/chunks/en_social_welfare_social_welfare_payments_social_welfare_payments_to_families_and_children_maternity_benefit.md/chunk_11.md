####  Getting your extra Maternity Benefit

Before the end of the first 26 weeks of Maternity Benefit, you must send the
DSP a letter from the hospital confirming the actual date of birth and the
number of weeksâ€™ gestation at which your baby was born. You must send this
information to get your full entitlement.

The following example shows how the extra Maternity Benefit works.

**Example - baby is born in week 30**

You may have planned to start your maternity leave and Maternity Benefit at
week 37 of your pregnancy, 2 weeks before the end of the week when your baby
was due.

If your baby is born in week 30 of your pregnancy (approximately 7 weeks
before you planned to start Maternity Benefit) you still claim Maternity
Benefit for the standard 26 weeks from the date of birth. However, you can
claim an extra 7 weeks at the end of the 26 weeks, so your Maternity Benefit
will last until your baby is approximately 33 weeks old.
