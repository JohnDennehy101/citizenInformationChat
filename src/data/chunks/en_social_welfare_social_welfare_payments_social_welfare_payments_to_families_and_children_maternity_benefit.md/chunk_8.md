##  How long is Maternity Benefit paid?

Maternity Benefit is paid for 26 weeks (156 days). Sunday is not counted.

At least 2 weeks and not more than 16 weeks of leave must be taken before the
end of the week in which your baby is due.

To make sure that you take the minimum 2-week maternity leave before the birth
of your baby, you must start your maternity leave on the Monday before the
week in which your baby is due. For example, if your due date is Wednesday 16
October 2024, the latest date for the start of your maternity leave is Monday
7 October 2024.

You can take a further 16 weeks of unpaid [ maternity leave
](/en/employment/employment-rights-and-conditions/leave-and-
holidays/maternity-leave/) immediately after your 26 weeksâ€™ paid Maternity
Benefit. This period is not covered by Maternity Benefit but you will be
entitled to a [ credited social insurance contribution ](/en/social-
welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/social-insurance-prsi/credited-social-
insurance-contributions/) for each week of unpaid leave you take (up to the
maximum of 16).
