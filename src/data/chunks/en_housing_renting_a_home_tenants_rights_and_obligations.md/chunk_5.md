##  Your rights as a tenant in student-specific accommodation

Student-specific accommodation (SSA) is housing that is:

  * Built or designated for students 
  * Used solely to provide residential accommodation to students during the academic term 

Tenants in student-specific accommodation are protected in residential
tenancies legislation. They have most of the same rights as private tenants.
For example, you can access the RTB’s dispute resolution process and your
tenancy or licence arrangement must be registered with the RTB. However, there
are some differences:

  * You do not have [ security of tenure ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/housing/renting-a-home/tenants-rights-and-responsibilities/types-of-tenancy/#384575) . This came in under the [ Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2019 (pdf) ](https://data.oireachtas.ie/ie/oireachtas/act/2019/14/eng/enacted/a1419.pdf) . 
  * You cannot be forced to pay for student-specific accommodation during the summer when you don’t need it. Your tenancy or licence arrangement should not be more than 41 weeks, unless you ask for longer. If your landlord does not comply with the 41-week rule you should contact to the RTB, who can sanction your landlord. This rule came in under the [ Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2024 ](https://data.oireachtas.ie/ie/oireachtas/act/2024/22/eng/enacted/a2224.pdf) and applies to tenancies and licence arrangements in student-specific accommodation created from 20 July 2024. 
  * You only need to give your landlord 28 days’ notice when ending a tenancy. You can give your landlord more notice if you want and your [ landlord must give you more. ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/housing/renting-a-home/tenants-rights-and-responsibilities/if-your-landlord-wants-you-to-leave/#6a8d36) This came in under the [ Residential Tenancies (No. 2) Act 2021 ](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2021/act/17/enacted/en/html) . 
  * You can terminate your fixed-term tenancy any time between 1 May and 1 October each year for any reason. But, outside of these dates, the existing rules about ending a fixed-term tenancy apply and you can only terminate your tenancy for specific reasons. This rule came in under the [ Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2024 ](http://residential%20tenancies%20\(amendment\)%20act%202024/) .
