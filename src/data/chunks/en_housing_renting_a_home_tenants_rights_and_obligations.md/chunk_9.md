###  Other charges and payments

The owner (your landlord) is responsible for paying the [ Local Property Tax
](/en/money-and-tax/tax/housing-taxes-and-reliefs/local-property-tax/) to
Revenue. There may be an agreement that you will pay this amount, but your
liability will be to the landlord and not to Revenue.

The terms of your letting agreement will detail if you have to pay for
services such as heating, electricity, gas or TV connections. In practice, if
you are renting a house, you will probably pay for all these charges.

**Multi-unit developments**

In some multi-unit developments, such as apartment complexes, the heating may
be operated centrally and you may not have to pay separately for it. In some
complexes, cable TV may be supplied. In most complexes, bin collection is
organised by the [ management company ](/en/housing/owning-a-home/home-
owners/management-companies-for-apartment-blocks/) and you may not have to pay
charges for this.

There are annual charges in multi-unit developments to pay for:

  * Routine maintenance 
  * Insurance and repair of common areas 
  * Provision of common services 
  * A sinking fund for non-routine refurbishment and maintenance expenses 

Your landlord may pass these charges on to you if this is agreed, but if they
are not paid, the ownersâ€™ management company will pursue the owner for them.
