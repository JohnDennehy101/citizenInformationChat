##  Security of tenure

Security of tenure is a tenant’s right to stay in rented accommodation for a
set amount of time. Generally, security of tenure applies automatically when
you have been renting for 6 months and haven’t received a valid notice of
termination from your landlord in that time. When you have security of tenure,
your landlord can only terminate your tenancy for a limited number of reasons,
see our page ‘ [ If your landlord wants you to leave ](/en/housing/renting-a-
home/tenants-rights-and-responsibilities/if-your-landlord-wants-you-to-leave/)
’.

The amount of time you are entitled to stay in rented accommodation after the
first 6 months depends on when your tenancy began.

**If your tenancy was created after 10 June 2022** , you have a tenancy of
unlimited duration. This means if you have rented somewhere for 6 months, you
have the right to stay in that accommodation indefinitely (no end date),
unless the landlord wants to terminate your tenancy for one of the allowed
reasons.

**If your tenancy was created before 10 June 2022** , you have the right to
stay in your rented accommodation for up to 6 years after you have rented for
6 months. At the end of these 6 years, your landlord can end your tenancy
without giving a reason, as allowed under the old rules. But, if the landlord
does not end your tenancy at this stage, it automatically becomes a tenancy of
unlimited duration and has no end date.
