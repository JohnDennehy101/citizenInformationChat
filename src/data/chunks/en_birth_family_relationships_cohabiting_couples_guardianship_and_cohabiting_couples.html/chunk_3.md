##  Automatic guardianship

Married parents of a child, including an adopted child, have automatic
guardianship of their children. This means they do not have to apply to court
for guardianship. They are joint guardians. This applies whether the couple
marry before or after the child's birth. Separation or divorce does not change
this automatic right.

If the biological parents of a child marry each other after the birth, then
the father automatically becomes a joint guardian of the child. There is,
therefore, no need to apply for guardianship rights nor is there any need for
the father to adopt the child.

For children born to parents that are not married to each other, only the
mother has an automatic right to guardianship. Even if a father's name is
registered on the child's birth certificate, this does not give him any
guardianship rights in respect of the child.

However, an unmarried parent will automatically be a guardian if they have
lived with the child's mother for 12 months in a row, including at least 3
months with the mother and child following the child's birth.
