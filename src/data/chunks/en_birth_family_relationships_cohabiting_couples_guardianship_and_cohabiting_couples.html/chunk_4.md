##  Guardianship by agreement

If the mother agrees, the father can become a joint guardian if both parents
sign a _statutory declaration_ . The [ statutory declaration (SI 210 of 2020)
(pdf) ](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2020/si/210/made/en/pdf) must be
signed in the presence of a [ Notary Public
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/justice/civil-law/notaries-public/) ,
[ Peace Commissioner ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/justice/civil-
law/peace-commissioners/) or a [ Commissioner for Oaths
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/justice/civil-law/commissioners-for-
oaths/) or a registrar of a [ civil registration service
](https://www2.hse.ie/services/births-deaths-and-marriages/contact-a-civil-
registration-service.html) .

This declaration states the names of the parents of the child, that they are
unmarried and that they agree that the father should be appointed as a joint
guardian. If there is more than one child, a separate statutory declaration
form should be completed for every child.

SI 210 of 2020 also provides a [ statutory declaration form (pdf)

second parent to become joint guardians by agreement of a child born as a
result of a donor-assisted human reproduction procedure.
