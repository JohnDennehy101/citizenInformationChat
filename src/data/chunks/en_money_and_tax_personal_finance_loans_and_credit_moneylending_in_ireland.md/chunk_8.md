##  Interest rates

A loan from a moneylender will usually have a higher interest rate [
](/en/money-and-tax/personal-finance/savings-and-investments/interest-on-
loans-and-savings/) than a loan from a credit union or a bank.

As with all loans, you should look at the total cost of the loan. That is, the
amount of extra money you will have to pay back that is over and above the
amount of the original loan.

For high cost credit agreements made since 14 November 2022, there is a
maximum term and maximum rate of interest allowed for a loan. Loans can be for
a maximum term of 52 weeks.

The maximum interest rate is:

  * 48% per year or 
  * 1% per week 

If the credit is provided as a running account, it can be for more than 52
weeks and the maximum interest is 2.83% per month.

Moneylenders are not allowed to charge any extra interest or charges above
what they are licensed to charge and what they have stated they will charge at
the start of the loan.

Moneylenders are not allowed to offer you top-up loans or a second loan to pay
off the first loan, as this would place you further in debt. They are also not
allowed to take an amount from the overall loan and treat it as a first
repayment.
