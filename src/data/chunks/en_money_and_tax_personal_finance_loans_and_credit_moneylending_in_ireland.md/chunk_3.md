##  Borrowing from a licensed moneylender

Moneylenders must have a licence to offer moneylending services in Ireland.
The [ Central Bank of Ireland regulates moneylenders
](http://www.centralbank.ie/regulation/industry-sectors/money-
lenders/Pages/default.aspx) . It is responsible for issuing moneylending
licences and it sets the rules that moneylenders must follow.

Since November 2022, the legal term for licensed moneylenders is _high cost
credit providers_ and their loans are called _high cost credit_ .

You should only borrow from a moneylender that is licensed. This protects you
and your money from predatory lenders or bogus websites. If you are not sure
whether a moneylender is licensed, you should [ check the Central Bankâ€™s
Register of High Cost Credit Providers
