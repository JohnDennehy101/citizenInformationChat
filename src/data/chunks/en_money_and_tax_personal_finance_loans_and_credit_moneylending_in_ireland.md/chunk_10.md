##  How to make a complaint about a moneylender

If you have a complaint about a moneylender, you should first discuss your
complaint with the lender.

If, after following their complaints process, you are still not satisfied with
the response, you can refer the complaint to the [ Financial Services and
Pensions Ombudsman (FSPO) ](https://www.fspo.ie/) . The FSPO is an
independent, statutory body that can investigate your complaint.
