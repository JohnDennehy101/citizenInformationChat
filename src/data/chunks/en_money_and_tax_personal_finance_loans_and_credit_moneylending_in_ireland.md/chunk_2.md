##  Introduction

A moneylending loan is a type of loan that is for a short time and at a high
cost. Using a moneylender is one of the most expensive ways to borrow money.

Moneylending loans are generally:

  * For small amounts compared to other types of loans 
  * For a short length of time (called the _term_ of the loan) 
  * At a high rate of interest compared with other loans available 

There are [ other types of loans available ](/en/money-and-tax/personal-
finance/loans-and-credit/borrowing-money-in-ireland/) that are cheaper. Banks
and credit unions, for example, are not moneylenders.
