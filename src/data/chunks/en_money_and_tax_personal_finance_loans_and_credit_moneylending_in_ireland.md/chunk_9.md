##  If you fall behind on repayments

If you are struggling to pay back a loan, you should contact the lender as
soon as you can.

If you cannot sort out the problem directly with the lender, you can get help
by contacting MABS (the [ Money Advice and Budgeting Service ](/en/money-and-
tax/personal-finance/debt/mabs-service/) ). MABS is a free and confidential
service for people with debt or money management problems.

The lender can take legal action against you, if you do not pay instalments
due under the lending agreement. They must:

  * Give you 21 daysâ€™ written notice that they will take legal action 
  * Give an estimate of the legal costs you may have to pay 
  * Give you 21 days to pay the instalments before legal action can begin 

If you repeatedly miss repayments during the term of the loan, the lender may
get permission from the courts to start legal action immediately, without
waiting 21 days.
