###  Categories of vehicle

When applying to take a theory test, you will be asked to indicate the
category of vehicle you wish to be tested for. The [ categories of test
](/en/travel-and-recreation/motoring/driver-licensing/categories-of-motor-
vehicles-and-minimum-age-of-drivers-in-ireland/) are:

  * A – motorcycles and mopeds (Driving licence categories AM, A1, A2, A), 
  * B – cars, tractors and work vehicles (Driving licence categories B, BE, W) 
  * C – vans and trucks over 3,500kg (Driving licence categories C, C1, CE, C1E) 
  * D – buses (Driving licence categories D, D1, DE, D1E) 
  * CD – trucks and buses (Driving licence categories C, C1, CE, C1E, D, D1, DE, D1E) 
  * TMT – truck module (must have passed D test) 
  * BMT – bus module (must have passed C test) 

Categories A, B, C and D tests are available in Irish. If you want to complete
your test in the Irish language, you must indicate that when booking your
test.

If you already have a driving licence for a particular category and you want
to get a driving licence for a different category for which a different theory
test is required, you have to pass the theory test for that category before
you can [ apply for a learner permit ](/en/travel-and-
recreation/motoring/driver-licensing/learner-driving-permits-for-cars-and-
work-vehicles/) .

For example, if you have a driving licence for a car (category B) and you want
to get a driving licence for a van or truck (category C1), you must pass the
category C theory test and then apply for a category C1 learner permit.

If you pass a category C or D theory test, there is an option to sit a TMT or
BMT module test to get the other category (D or C as appropriate) provided
this is done within 2 years of the first test.
