###  Identification

The RSA has published a [ list of acceptable forms of identification
](https://theorytest.ie/book-your-theory-test/driver-theory-test-car-or-bike/)
you must show on the day of your theory test to be able to take the exam.
Failure to produce the correct identification will result in you not being
able to test and you will lose your test fee.

While you can legally take a driver theory test at any age, [ your pass
certificate ](https://www.rsa.ie/services/learner-drivers/the-driving-
test/after-you-pass-your-test) is only valid for 2 years, and you cannot get a
learner permit to drive any kind of vehicle in a public place in Ireland until
you are at least 16 years of age.
