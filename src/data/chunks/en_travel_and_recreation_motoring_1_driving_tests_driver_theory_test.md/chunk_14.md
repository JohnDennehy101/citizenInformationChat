###  Appealing your result

If you are unhappy with the result of your theory test, you have the right to
appeal this decision.

To appeal, you should speak to the driver theory test supervisor before
leaving the test centre. You can also fill out an appeal form, which is
available at every test centre. You can also phone the candidate services team
to request a rescore of you driver theory test by calling 0818 606 106.

You must make your appeal within 10 working days of your test. When your
appeal is received, your test will be re-marked and you will receive the
result within 5 to 10 working days. The fee for appealing is â‚¬15 which is
refunded if successful.

If the original marking was incorrect, you will be issued with your new theory
test certificate. You can read more about the [ Driver Theory Test Customer
Charter ](https://theorytest.ie/general-information/policy-and-customer-
