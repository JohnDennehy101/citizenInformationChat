##  Not guilty by reason of insanity

A person will be considered legally insane if they were suffering from a
mental disorder at the time of the offence and, as a result,

  * Did not understand what he or she was doing or 
  * Did not know what he or she was doing was wrong or 
  * Was unable to not commit the crime 

If someone is considered to have actually committed the offence but was insane
at the time, the verdict may be not guilty by reason of insanity. This
decision is made by a jury where the case is tried by a jury. Where there is
no jury, the decision is made by a judge. If this verdict is reached, the
judge may order that the person be committed to a psychiatric hospital or unit
in broadly the same way as applies in the case of being unfit to be tried.
