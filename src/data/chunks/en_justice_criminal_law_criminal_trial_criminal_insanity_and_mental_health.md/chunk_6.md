##  Mental Health Review Board

The [ Mental Health (Criminal Law) Review Board's
](http://www.mhclrb.ie/index.php) main function is to review the detention of
those found not guilty by reason of insanity or unfit to be tried, who have
been detained in a designated centre by order of a court. At present, the only
designated centre is the Central Mental Hospital. The Review Board also has
responsibility for people who have been convicted of offences and who become
mentally ill while serving their sentences. The Review Board must have regard
to the welfare and safety of the person whose detention it reviews and to the
public interest. It may assign a legal representative to the person unless the
person proposes to engage one.

The Board is composed of a legally qualified chairperson and a number of other
people, at least one of whom must be a consultant psychiatrist. It is obliged
to review each detention at least once every 6 months.
