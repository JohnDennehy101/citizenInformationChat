##  Pregnancy and the COVID-19 vaccine

If you have not had any COVID-19 vaccines, you can get your first round of
COVID-19 vaccination or first booster at any stage of your pregnancy.

If you had a booster dose during your current pregnancy, then a second booster
dose is not needed.

If you had a booster dose before this pregnancy, you can get your second
booster at or after 16 weeks of your pregnancy.

pregnancy, you can [ read the HSEâ€™s information booklet (pdf)
