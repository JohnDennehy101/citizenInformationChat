##  COVID-19 and pregnancy

If you are pregnant and think you may have been exposed to COVID-19, contact
your GP. Most women who test positive and have mild symptoms can safely self-
isolate at home (7 days). Routine antenatal or ultrasound appointments should
be postponed until after the period of self-isolation.

Pregnant women who have COVID-19 should only attend the hospital if in need of
urgent medical or obstetric care. It is important to phone the hospital before
going to make sure you are seen at the right place by the right medical team.

If you are booked to have a home birth and you are worried about COVID-19,
contact your self-employed community midwife or the maternity hospital where
you are booked for antenatal care.

Check with your local hospital about [ antenatal classes ](/en/birth-family-
relationships/before-your-baby-is-born/antenatal-classes/) as many have moved
online.
