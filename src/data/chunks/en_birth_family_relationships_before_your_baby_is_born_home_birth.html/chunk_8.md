##  How to apply

If you wish to have a home birth, you need to decide this as early as possible
in your pregnancy.

Contact a HSE Designated Midwifery Officer or a Self-Employed Community
Midwife (SECM) in the [ National Home Birth Service
](https://www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/3/maternity/homebirth-services.html) to
discuss your eligibility and find out more. Since June 2022, a temporary
suspension of the home birth service in the Midwest is in place pending the
outcome of an external review of the service.
