##  Introduction

You do not need to be resident in Ireland to get married here. However, you
may need a visa to come to Ireland if you are not a citizen of the UK,
Switzerland, or a country in the European Economic Area (the EU plus Norway,
Iceland, and Lichtenstein).

If you are an EEA, Swiss, or UK citizen, you can come to Ireland to get
married without a visa or immigration permission.

This page is a guide for non-EEA, Swiss, or UK citizens coming to Ireland to
marry their Irish citizen partner.
