###  Choosing a contractor

Before choosing a contractor from the [ SEAI's registered list
](https://hes.seai.ie/GrantProcess/ContractorSearch.aspx) , the SEAI
recommends that you:

  * Ask friends, family, and neighbours who have done building work recently, for advice and recommendations on contractors 
  * Get a number of quotes and compare them 
  * Request and check the contractorâ€™s references 
  * Formalise the relationship with your chosen contractor by drawing up a contract detailing the required works, prices, timescales, payment terms and warranties. The SEAI have [ a sample contract on their website ](https://www.seai.ie/publications/Model-Contract.pdf) .
