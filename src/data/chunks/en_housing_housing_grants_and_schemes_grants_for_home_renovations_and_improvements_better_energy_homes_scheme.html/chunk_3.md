###  How do I find out if my home would benefit from energy-saving work?

You can get a [ Building Energy Rating (BER) ](/en/housing/owning-a-home/home-
owners/getting-a-building-energy-rating-for-your-home/) done in advance of any
work. A BER assessor will rate the energy efficiency of your property and
provide you with a report, which identifies areas that could be improved to
increase its energy efficiency. [ The SEAI has information on their website
about the BER and how it works. ](https://www.seai.ie/home-energy/building-
energy-rating-ber/)
