  * Be the owner of a property built and occupied before 2021 for heat pumps and renewable systems such as, solar thermal and solar PV grants

  * Use newly fitted materials and products 
  * Have work done that meets the required standards 
  * Get a BER **after** the works are done using a [ BER assessor from SEAI’s National Register ](https://ndber.seai.ie/Pass/assessors/search.aspx)

These grants are available for homeowners, private landlords and [ owners’
management companies (OMCs)
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/housing/owning-a-home/home-
owners/management-companies-for-apartment-blocks/#lf7c65) . OMCs manage the
common areas in multi-unit developments and are made up of the owners of the
properties in the development. OMCs should contact the SEAI at [
info@betterenergyhomes.ie ](mailto:info@betterenergyhomes.ie) for advice
before applying.

**Note:** If your property was built before 1940, you may need to ask a
conservation architect for advice before applying. This is because modern
insulation methods covered by the grant may not be appropriate for your older
building. The SEAI has [ useful information about insulating older homes
