###  Social insurance classes

Social insurance contributions are divided into different categories, known as
classes or rates of contribution. The class and rate of contribution you pay
is determined by the nature of your work. For example, a person employed in a
supermarket earning less than €38 per week will be insured under Class J. If
that person earned over €38, they would probably be insured under Class A.
Most employees pay Class A PRSI.
