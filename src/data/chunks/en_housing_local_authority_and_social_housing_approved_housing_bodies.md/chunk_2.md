##  What is an approved housing body (AHB)?

Approved housing bodies (AHBs) are independent, not-for-profit organisations.
They provide affordable rented housing for people who cannot afford to pay
private sector rents or buy their own homes. Some AHBs provide housing
specifically for particular groups of people, such as older people or homeless
people. AHBs are also known as housing associations.

The term AHB also includes housing co-operatives. Housing co-operatives are
housing organisations that are controlled by their tenants. The tenants or
members of these co-operatives share responsibility for the management and
upkeep of their homes.

AHB's are known as _approved housing bodies_ because they are _approved_ under
the [ Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1992
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1992/act/18/section/6/enacted/en/html) .
This allows them to access assistance from local authorities to provide
housing.
