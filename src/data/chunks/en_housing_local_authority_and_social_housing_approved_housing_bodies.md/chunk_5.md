###  **Completing the social housing application form**

If you want to be considered for housing provided by an AHB, make sure you
tick the box marked **'approved housing body (AHB)' in the ‘Housing
Requirements’** section of the social housing application form.

Your [ local authority ](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/942f74-local-
authorities/) will be able to tell you if there are approved housing bodies in
your area. In most cases, the local authority will refer you to an AHB if an
appropriate home comes up. A very small number of AHBs may accept direct
applications.

If you need help filling out the social housing application form, you can
contact your [ local Citizens Information Centre
](https://centres.citizensinformation.ie/) or your local authority for help.
