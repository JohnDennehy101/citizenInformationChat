###  Residential Tenancies Board (RTB)

The Residential Tenancies Board (RTB) is responsible for regulating the rental
sector. It maintains a [ national register of tenancies
](https://www.rtb.ie/check/index.html) and provides a [ dispute resolution
service for tenants and landlords ](/en/housing/renting-a-home/resolving-
disputes/disputes-between-landlords-and-tenants/) .

AHBâ€™s have the same [ rights and obligations ](/en/housing/renting-a-
home/landlords-rights-and-responsibilities/landlords-rights-and-obligations/)
as private landlords. For example, they must [ register their tenancies
](/en/housing/renting-a-home/landlords-rights-and-
responsibilities/registering-a-tenancy/) every year with the RTB. AHB tenants
have the same [ rights and obligations ](/en/housing/renting-a-home/tenants-
rights-and-responsibilities/tenants-rights-and-obligations/) as private
tenants, with some exceptions.

The [ Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2015
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2015/act/42/enacted/en/html) brought AHB
tenancies under the remit of the RTB and means that these tenancies are
covered by residential tenancies legislation.
