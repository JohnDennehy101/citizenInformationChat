###  Secular ceremony

Secular ceremonies are legally recognised in Ireland if they are carried out
by a registered secular solemniser. Secular ceremonies are performed by bodies
that have a viewpoint that does not include anything religious or spiritual.
Humanist ceremonies are the most common type of secular ceremony in Ireland.

If you wish to get married by secular ceremony you should contact the
authorities of the secular body concerned for advice on how to proceed.
