##  Dáil bye-elections

When a TD (a [ member of the Dáil ](/en/government-in-ireland/houses-of-the-
oireachtas/dail-eireann/) ) dies or resigns, the Dáil (one of the houses of
Parliament in Ireland) passes a resolution directing the returning officer of
the TD's constituency to hold an election to fill the vacancy. The Dáil issues
a writ to the returning officer. A writ is a type of legal order.

The Dáil must issue the writ within 6 months of the death or retirement of the
TD. If it does not, then the Ceann Comhairle must direct the Clerk of the Dáil
to issue the writ. The law governing the issuing of writs in bye-elections is
the [ Electoral (Amendment) Act 2011
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2011/en/act/pub/0014/index.html) .

The procedure for nominating candidates, voting and the conduct of the count
in Dáil bye-elections is the same as for a [ general election
](/en/government-in-ireland/elections-and-referenda/voting/voting-procedure-
in-a-general-election/) .

A person who is currently a member of Dáil Eireann cannot be a candidate in a
Dáil bye-election.
