##  Rules

You can apply for a driving licence if you have passed the driving test for
that category of vehicle in the last 2 years. If your Certificate of
Competency (the document that proves that you passed the driving test) is over
2 years old, you will have to take the driving test again.

You must bring your driving licence with you when driving.
