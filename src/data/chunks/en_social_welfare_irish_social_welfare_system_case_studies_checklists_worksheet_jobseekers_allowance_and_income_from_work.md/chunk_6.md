###  Step 3: Average daily earnings

Now that you know you are entitled to a JA payment, you can start to calculate
the rate of your JA payment.

Calculate your average daily earnings: to do this get your total weekly
assessable earnings from employment and divide by the number of days you
worked that week.

Total weekly earnings ÷ number of days worked = average daily earnings.

**Example**  
---  
Jim works 3 days each week (Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday) and gets €150 per
week.  €150 ÷ 3 = €50  Average daily earnings = €50
