###  Step 4: Daily means from work

Calculate your daily means from work.

To do this, you must disregard any income not taken into account. Income not
taken into account is €20 for days worked. Next get 60% of the balance. This
is assessed as your daily means.

Average daily earnings - €20 = total x 60% = daily means from work.

**Example**  
---  
Jim works 3 days (Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday) and gets €50 per day. His
average daily earnings are €50 (see Step 3).  €50 - €20 = €30  Get 60% of
total (€30 in this example) = €18  Daily means from work = €18
