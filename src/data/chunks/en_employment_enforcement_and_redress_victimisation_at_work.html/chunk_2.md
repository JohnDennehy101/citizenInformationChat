##  Introduction

Victimisation is where you are treated unfairly by your employer because of
some action you have taken to access your legal employment rights.

As a worker, you have strong employment rights, and you cannot be punished by
your employer for seeking to avail of those rights.

You are protected from victimisation under various employment legislation.
Some legislation uses the word penalisation, other legislation refers to it as
_victimisation_ .
