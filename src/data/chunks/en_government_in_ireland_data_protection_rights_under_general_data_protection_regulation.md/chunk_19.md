###  Garda records

You can ask An Garda Síochána for a copy of any personal data that it has
about you. When you make an access request to the Gardaí, you are generally
entitled to:

  * Get a copy of the personal data being kept about you 
  * Be told why the data is being kept 
  * Be told the identity of anyone that the Gardaí has shared the data with 
  * Be told how the Gardaí obtained the data (unless this would be against public interest, for example, cause a risk of harm to someone else) 

You can make a request for your personal data using the [ Garda Síochána
subject access request form (pdf) ](https://www.garda.ie/en/about-us/online-
services/data-protection-foi-police-certificates/an-garda-
siochana-f20-october-2019-.pdf) . Post the completed form to the address on
the form or email it to [ DataProtection@Garda.ie
](mailto:DataProtection@Garda.ie) .

The Gardaí can refuse your request for personal data and withhold that
information in the following situations:

  * Your request for data would identify someone else. This also applies to the Gardaí's obligation to give you details of the source of the information. If the source of the information identifies somebody else, the Gardaí can withhold it 
  * They have to refuse so as to prevent, detect or investigate crime, or to arrest or prosecute offenders 
  * There are existing or expected legal proceedings or claims
