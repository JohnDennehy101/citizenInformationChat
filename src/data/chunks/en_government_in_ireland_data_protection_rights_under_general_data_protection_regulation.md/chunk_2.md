##  Data protection terms

You have a fundamental right of access to your personal data from data
controllers under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

**Personal data** is information that relates to you, or can identify you,
either by itself or together with other available information. Personal data
can include your name, address, contact details, an identification number, IP
address, CCTV footage, access cards, audio-visual or audio recordings of you,
and location data.

Under data protection law, if an organisation or company is holding or using
your personal data, you are known as a **data subject** .

The organisation or company holding or using that data, is known as a **data
controller** . However, the data controller can allow another person,
organisation or company, known as a **data processor** , to process your
personal data on its behalf.

Doing anything with your personal data, including storing it, is known as
**processing** .
