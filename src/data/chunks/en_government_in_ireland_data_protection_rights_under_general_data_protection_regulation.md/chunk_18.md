###  Medical records

Your medical records are your personal information and you are entitled to
access them.

If you are a patient in a public or publicly-funded hospital, or have a
medical card or GP visit card, you can seek access in the following ways:

  * Make an access request under data protection law. 
  * Make an access request under the [ Freedom of Information Act ](/en/government-in-ireland/how-government-works/standards-and-accountability/freedom-of-information/) . 
  * Write to the service provider or Health Service Executive and ask for your records. 

You may have to provide information to help them locate your file, including
your date of birth, current and previous addresses, the contacts you had with
specific services and approximate dates

Under data protection law, you can be refused access to your medical records
if disclosure would give rise to serious harm to your physical or mental
health. You can read [ more about access to medical records
