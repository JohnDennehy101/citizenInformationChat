###  What can I do if I am unhappy with the outcome of an access request?

If you are unhappy with the way your access request was processed, you can
make a complaint to the [ Data Protection Commission (DPC)
](https://www.dataprotection.ie/) .

The DPC is Irelandâ€™s independent authority with responsibility for upholding
the right of people in the EU to have their personal data protected. It
monitors compliance with GDPR and other data protection legislation and deals
with complaints in relation to data protection breaches. The [ DPC website
](https://www.dataprotection.ie/) contains helpful explanations of data
protection law.

You may be unhappy with the way your request was handled because:

  * There was no response or a delayed response to your access request 
  * The response to the request was incomplete 
  * You believe the data controller wrongly relied on exemptions to not share your personal data with you
