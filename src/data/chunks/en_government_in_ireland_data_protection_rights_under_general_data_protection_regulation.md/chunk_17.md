###  Children’s personal data

Children have the same data protection rights as adults and can make access
requests. However, they are given specific protection with regard to their
personal data. This is because they may be less aware of the risks and
consequences of sharing their personal data. Also, they may be less aware of
the safeguards available and their rights in relation to how their personal
information is processed.

Parents and guardians may also be able to make access requests or exercise any
other data protection right on behalf of their children. If a request is made
by a parent or guardian, the data controller must consider the nature and
circumstances of the request, including the age, capacity and views of the
child and the child’s best interests.
