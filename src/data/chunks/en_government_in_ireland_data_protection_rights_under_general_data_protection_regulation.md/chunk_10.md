###  Costs

There is generally no fee for making an access request.

The main exception to this is where your access request is considered
‘manifestly unfounded or excessive’. For example, if you continue to make the
same access request even though it has already been dealt with. If a data
controller can prove that your request is manifestly unfounded or excessive,
they can charge a reasonable fee for the administrative costs of providing the
information requested.

They may also charge a fee based on administrative costs if you ask for
additional copies of the information.
