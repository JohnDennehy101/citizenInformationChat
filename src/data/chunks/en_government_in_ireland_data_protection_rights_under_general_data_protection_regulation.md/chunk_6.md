###  Make your request in writing

Ask as soon as possible and in writing. This can either be by letter or email.
Seeking your personal data is known as _making an access request_ or a _data
subject access request_ . You should state in the letter or email that it is
an access request. This means that both you and the data controller will have
a record of the request and its content if an issue arises later. Some large
companies allow you to automatically download your personal information
directly through their website.
