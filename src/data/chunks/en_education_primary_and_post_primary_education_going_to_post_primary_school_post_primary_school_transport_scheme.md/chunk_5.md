###  Changes from 2012

The schoolâ€™s _Catchment Boundary Area_ was used up to 2012-2013 to determine
the eligibility of post-primary pupils for school transport. Under this
system, pupils living more than 4.8 kilometres from the post-primary school
catering for the catchment area where they live are fully eligible for school
transport to their school. Pupils who became eligible for transport under this
arrangement continue to be eligible so long as their circumstances remain the
same, for example where they continue to reside at the same address and attend
the same school.

Since September 2012, pupils who start post-primary school will not be
assessed under the catchment area system. They must be living 4.8 km or more
from the nearest post-primary education centre, having regard to ethos and
language, in order to qualify for transport.

There are also changes for pupils with medical cards - see 'Rates' below.
