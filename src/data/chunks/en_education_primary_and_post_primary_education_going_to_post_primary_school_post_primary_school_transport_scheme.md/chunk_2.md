##  What is the school transport scheme?

The Department of Education provides subsidised school transport for post-
primary pupils who live more than 4.8 kilometres away from the appropriate
school.

Bus Éireann runs the school bus service and the Department of Education
decides the annual fares. The Department and Bus Éireann decide what is the
relevant school, considering:

  * Ethos 
  * Language 
  * The shortest traversable route from the child’s home. 

The service is only provided where there are at least 10 eligible pupils in an
area that can be economically serviced by a bus route. Even when a pupil meets
the age and distance criteria for school transport, there is no legal
entitlement to transport.

**Applications for school transport services 2024-2025 are now open** . **The
closing date for on-time applications is 26 April 2024.**

You can submit your application on the [ Bus Éireann
](https://www.buseireann.ie/inner.php?id=256) website (see ‘How to apply for
the School Transport Scheme’ below).
