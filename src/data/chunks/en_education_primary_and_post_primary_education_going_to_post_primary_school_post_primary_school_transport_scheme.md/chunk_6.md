###  Transport arrangements

Parents must arrange to bring their child to the nearest pick-up point on the
bus route. Generally, bus routes are organised so that no pupil has more than
3.2 kilometres to travel to a pick-up point.

There is provision for parents to pay for the bus service to be extended to a
closer point, where this is feasible from the point of view of time and where
it would not result in a major disruption to other pupils using the service.

Pupils attending a recognised post-primary school that is not the post-primary
school for their area can use the service if there is room on the bus,
provided they live at least 4.8 kilometres from the school in question.

Pupils may be given transport to enable them to attend the nearest all-Irish
post-primary school or a post-primary school for their particular ethos if
they live at least 4.8 kilometres or more from that school.
