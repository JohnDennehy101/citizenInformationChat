##  Planning to adapt your home

Before making changes to your home you should meet with an [ occupational
therapist ](/en/health/health-services/care-in-your-community/occupational-
therapy-services/) (OT) who will assess your daily living needs and suggest
changes to your home. You can contact an OT through the [ community care
](/en/health/health-services/care-in-your-community/community-care-services/)
section of [ your Local Health Office
](http://www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/1/LHO/) .

Alternatively, you can hire an OT privately, as there can be a waiting list
for the public OT service. The [ Association of Occupational Therapists of
Ireland ](http://www.aoti.ie/) (AOTI) maintains a [ list of OTs in private
practice ](https://www.aoti.ie/) . If you get a grant for the adaptations, you
may be able to get back some of the costs of hiring the OT.

Other health professionals, such as [ public health nurses
](/en/health/health-services/care-in-your-community/public-health-nurses/) and
[ physiotherapists ](/en/health/health-services/care-in-your-
community/physiotherapy-services/) , can also advise you on specialised
equipment and home adaptations, based on both your short-term and long-term
needs.

A Healthy Age Friendly Homes Coordinator can also provide information and
advice on things like:

  * Living independently 
  * Adapting your home 
  * Moving to a new home that is more suitable to your needs 

This initiative is being piloted in a number of local authorities. See [
Healthy Age Friendly Homes Programme
](https://agefriendlyireland.ie/category/healthy-age-friendly-homes-
programme/introduction/) for more information.

If you need to add a structure or an extra room, you may need to apply for [
planning permission ](/en/housing/planning-permission/planning-permission-for-
altering-a-house/) .
