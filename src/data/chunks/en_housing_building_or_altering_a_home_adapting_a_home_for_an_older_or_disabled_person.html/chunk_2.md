##  How can I adapt my home?

As you get older, you may need to adapt your home so you can continue to live
there. You may also need to adapt your home if you or a family member has a
disability.

Some common changes that can help make your home more suitable for someone
with a disability or limited mobility include:

  * Widening doorways and passageways 
  * Moving light switches, door handles and doorbells to convenient heights 
  * Installing grab rails for support 
  * Adapting bathroom facilities (for example, removing a bath and installing a level access shower) 
  * Moving bathrooms or bedrooms to the ground floor 
  * Installing ramps so you don't need to use steps 
  * Making sure that the entrances to the house, such as paths or drives have a firm, level surface 
  * Installing a stairlift or through-floor lift 
  * Getting specialised furniture, like an adjustable bed or high-support chairs 
  * Installing alert devices for someone who is deaf or hard of hearing 

In case of a fire or other emergencies, exits should always be accessible and
you should not rely only on mechanical means (such as a lift) to get out.
