###  Right to privacy

You have a limited right to privacy. For example, you may not to be stripped,
searched or bathed in the presence of another prisoner. In addition, you have
the right to be exposed to the public view as little as possible while being
removed from or to prison. However, you may be photographed. Your right to
privacy may be limited for security reasons.

Your telephone calls can be monitored and recorded, except for calls you make
to your solicitor or calls you make to counselling services (for example, the
Samaritans). A prison officer will open a check any letters you want to send,
except for letters to your solicitor or to certain organisations, like the
Parole Board, the Minister for Justice and the European Court of Human Rights.
