####  Contributory pensions

You can get [ State Pension (Contributory) ](/en/social-welfare/older-and-
retired-people/state-pension-contributory/) while you are in prison.

You can continue to get the personal rate of [ Widow’s, Widower’s or Surviving
Civil Partners (Contributory) Pension
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/death-related-
benefits/widowed-persons-contrib-pension/) while in prison or in legal
custody, if you were getting it before going to prison or being detained. The
increase for a qualified child may be paid to another person during this time.

[ Invalidity Pension ](/en/social-welfare/disability-and-illness/invalidity-
pension/) is not payable because you must be permanently incapable of work due
to an illness or disability and for no other reason. However, if you were
getting Invalidity Pension before going into prison, you can resume your IP
when you are released. You do not need to reapply. You will need to provide
the Invalidity section with their release papers.
