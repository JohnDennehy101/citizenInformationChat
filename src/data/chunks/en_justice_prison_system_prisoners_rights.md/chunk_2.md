##  Introduction

The Irish Prison Service, the body responsible for the day-to-day operation of
Irish prisons, must respect the rights and entitlements of all those committed
to its custody by the courts.

Ireland has also agreed to follow the terms of 4 international treaties which
set out standards for the treatment of prisoners. These are:

  * [ European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) ](https://www.echr.coe.int/documents/d/echr/convention_ENG)
  * [ European Convention for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment ](http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/Commun/QueVoulezVous.asp?NT=126&CM=8&DF=29/06/2015&CL=ENG)
  * [ International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) ](http://www.ohchr.org/EN/ProfessionalInterest/Pages/CCPR.aspx)
  * [ Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CAT) ](http://www.ohchr.org/en/hrbodies/cat/pages/catindex.aspx)

Further guidance is provided by the Council of Europe’s [ European Prison
Rules ](http://www.coe.int/t/dghl/standardsetting/prisons/default_en.asp)
which set out basic standards for the treatment of prisoners.

The main source of prisoners’ rights is the [ Prison Rules 2007
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2007/en/si/0252.html) to [ 2020
](https://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2020/si/250/made/en/print) .
