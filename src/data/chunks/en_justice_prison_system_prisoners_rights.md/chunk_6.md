##  Right to vote and freedom of association

If you want to vote but you are in prison, you should fill out the [ PV6
application form (pdf)
](https://www.waterfordcouncil.ie/media/forms/register/PV6.pdf) . This is an
application for a postal vote for registered voters detained in prison.

If you happen to be on parole or temporary release at the time of an election,
you are free to vote where you are registered. However, you have no right to
temporary release in order to vote at the ballot box. If you are on [ remand
](/en/justice/arrests/detention-after-arrest/) , your rights are the same as
if you were a convicted prisoner.

The [ Electoral (Amendment) Act 2006
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2006/en/act/pub/0033/index.html) enables
prisoners to vote by post.
