###  How long does SAFE registration take?

SAFE registration takes about 15 minutes to complete. It is important that you
attend for your appointment. It will help to avoid any potential difficulty
with access to social welfare payments in the future. During this appointment
your photograph will be taken and your signature recorded for your new Public
Services Card, which will be posted to your home address. You will also be
asked to provide answers to some security questions.

You must bring certain documents to your appointment to prove your identity
and address. You should also bring the letter confirming your appointment and,
if you have one, your mobile phone. Having your mobile phone with you means
that your number can be verified by the Department. You will need phone
verification to access [ public services online ](https://www.mygovid.ie/) .
If you currently have a Social Services Card (a swipe card used to collect
social welfare payments), bring that with you too.

You must prove your identify to receive a social welfare payment or benefit.
If you comply with the SAFE registration process when requested, you are
considered to have authenticated your identity. If you do not comply with the
SAFE registration process, your social welfare payments (including Child
Benefit) and/or your social welfare entitlements (such as Free Travel) may be
suspended.
