---|---  
Irish citizens born in Northern Ireland and UK citizens  |  Current passport, or your birth certificate and current driving licence*   
Irish citizens via naturalisation or Foreign Birth Registration  |  Current Irish passport or Certificate of Naturalisation or Foreign Birth Registration Certificate, and Irish or UK driving licence or Irish learner driver permit, and your adoption certificate (if applicable)   
EU citizens (other than Irish and UK)  |  Current passport or national identity card

*If you are an Irish citizen or UK citizen and do not have a passport or driving licence as identification, you may still be issued with a Public Services Card. Additional information which can be verified to confirm your identity may be gathered at your appointment interview. 

For Irish citizens born in Ireland, birth details can be verified online in
most cases with the General Register Office. However, in some cases, it is not
possible to locate the birth registration, so you may need to return with a
copy of your birth certificate.
