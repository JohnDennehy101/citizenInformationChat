###  OFP and Working Family Payment

If you are working and getting [ Working Family Payment (WFP) ](/en/social-
welfare/families-and-children/working-family-payment/) in addition to OFP,
your WFP will be automatically reviewed when your OFP ends. In most cases this
will lead to an increase in your WFP.

You may also qualify for the [ Back to Work Family Dividend (BTWFD)
](/en/social-welfare/families-and-children/back-to-work-family-dividend/) .
This payment allows parents getting One-Parent Family Payment or a jobseekerâ€™s
payment to keep the full [ Increase for a Qualified Child ](/en/social-
welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/claiming-a-social-welfare-
payment/claiming-and-increase-in-your-payment-for-a-child-dependant/) for the
first year of employment or self-employment and half that amount in the second
year. BTWFD can be paid as well as WFP and it will have no impact on your
entitlement to WFP.

If you have a general question about Working Family Payment, you can call the
WFP section at (043) 334 0053 or e-mail [ WFPSupport@welfare.ie
