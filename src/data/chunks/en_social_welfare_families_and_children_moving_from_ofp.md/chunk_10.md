###  OFP and employment schemes

If you are on an [ employment scheme ](/en/employment/unemployment-and-
redundancy/employment-support-schemes/schemes-to-support-employment/) (such as
Community Employment) when your entitlement to OFP ends, you can continue on
the scheme until it finishes and get a payment. Department of Social
Protection (DSP) staff will arrange this for you.
