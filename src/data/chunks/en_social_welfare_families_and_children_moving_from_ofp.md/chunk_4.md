###  Jobseeker’s Transitional payment

Most people who no longer qualify for a One-Parent Family Payment because
their youngest child is aged 7 will transfer to the Jobseeker’s Transitional
payment (called JST).

JST is paid to people who are not cohabiting and whose youngest child is aged
between 7 and 13. It aims to support you into the workforce while also
acknowledging that you are caring for young children. You can take part in a
course of education and get JST. You can get more information in our document
on the [ Jobseeker’s Transitional payment ](/en/social-welfare/unemployed-
people/jobseekers-transitional-payment/) .
