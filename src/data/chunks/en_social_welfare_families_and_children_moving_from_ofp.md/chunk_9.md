###  OFP and return to education

If you are taking part in a recognised education course when your entitlement
to OFP ends you can finish your course and get a payment. The payment you
qualify for depends on your circumstances.

If you are in education and your OFP ends because your youngest child has
reached the age limit you can move to the Jobseekerâ€™s Transitional payment
(JST) and continue your course. You can claim JST and a student grant at the
same time and the grant will not be assessed as means for JST. However, you
should note that you cannot claim [ Rent Supplement ](/en/social-
welfare/supplementary-welfare-schemes/rent-supplement/) if you are getting a
student grant or if you are in full-time education. (Entitlement to HAP is not
affected by this rule.)

It is important to remember that your entitlement to JST will end when your
youngest child reaches the age of 14. If you have not finished your course
when your youngest child reaches the age of 14 you will have to either
transfer to the [ Back to Education Allowance ](/en/social-welfare/back-to-
education/back-to-education-allowance/) to complete your course or opt to
remain in receipt of your student grant.
