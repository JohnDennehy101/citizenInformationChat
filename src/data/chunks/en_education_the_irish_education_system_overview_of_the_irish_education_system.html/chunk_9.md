##  Further and adult education

After post-primary school many students move on to further education or third
level (see third-level education below). The [ National Framework of
Qualifications (NFQ) ](https://www.qqi.ie/what-we-do/the-qualifications-
system/national-framework-of-qualifications) has 10 levels of education and
allows you to compare the different standards and levels of education
available to you across the education system.
