###  Senior Cycle and examinations

Children can have a 2 or 3-year Senior Cycle. The Senior Cycle is 3 years, if
you opt to include [ Transition Year ](/en/education/primary-and-post-primary-
education/going-to-post-primary-school/transition-year/) .

The Transition year allows students to experience a wide range of educational
instruction and work experience.

During their final 2 years in the [ Senior Cycle ](/en/education/primary-and-
post-primary-education/going-to-post-primary-school/senior-cycle/) , students
take one of 3 programmes, each leading to a State examination:

  * Established Leaving Certificate 
  * Leaving Certificate Vocational Programme 
  * Leaving Certificate Applied 

The [ established Leaving Certificate ](/en/education/state-
examinations/leaving-certificate/) is the main basis on which students are
allocated places in universities, institutes of technology and colleges of
education.

The [ Leaving Certificate Vocational Programme ](/en/education/state-
examinations/leaving-certificate-vocational-programme/) has elements of the
established Leaving Certificate but concentrates on technical subjects and
includes additional modules with a vocational focus.

The [ Leaving Certificate Applied Programme ](/en/education/state-
examinations/leaving-certificate-applied/) aims to prepare students for adult
and working life through relevant learning experiences. It is for students who
wish to follow a practical or vocational programme. It is not recognised for
direct entry to third-level courses but it can enable students to take [ Post-
Leaving Certificate courses ](/en/education/further-education-and-
training/post-leaving-certificate-courses/) .
