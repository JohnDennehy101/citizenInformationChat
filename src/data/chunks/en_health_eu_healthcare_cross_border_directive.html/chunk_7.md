###  Prior authorisation

If the treatment involves an overnight stay in hospital then it will need to
be authorised in advance by the HSE. For other treatment it is advisable to
check whether prior authorisation is required by contacting the National
Contact Point.

The [ application form for prior authorisation (pdf)
](http://www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/1/schemes/cbd/appreimbursement/HSE_CBD_Application_for_Prior_Authorisation_.pdf)
must be completed by you and by the medical professional who is referring you
for treatment abroad. Completed applications take 15 to 20 working days to
process and you will be notified of the decision by letter.

Prior authorisation is also required for healthcare that involves:

  * Highly specialised and cost-intensive medical infrastructure or equipment 
  * Treatments presenting a particular risk for the patient or the population 
  * A healthcare provider that could give rise to serious and specific concerns relating to the quality or safety of the care
