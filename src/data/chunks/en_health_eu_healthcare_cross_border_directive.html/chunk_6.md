###  Referral to healthcare abroad

In the same way that you would be referred to public health services in
Ireland, you must be referred to the health service you require abroad. This
may be, for example, by your GP (family doctor) or public hospital consultant.
In the case of some community-based services the appropriate referral could be
by a Health Service Executive (HSE) professional such as a public health
nurse, community dentist or HSE orthodontist.

The referral letter should specify the healthcare required, the health
professional abroad you are being referred to and their clinic, hospital or
other location. You, or the person referring you, should be satisfied that the
healthcare provider abroad is qualified and suitable. If you wish to access
information on services or service providers abroad please contact the [
National Contact Point for the other EU/EEA State.
](https://europa.eu/youreurope/citizens/health/planned-healthcare/get-more-
info/index_en.htm)

Make sure that the service you are seeking to access abroad is covered by the
Cross-Border Healthcare Directive. Your referring clinician can advise you
about this but if you are in doubt you can contact the [ National Contact
Point in Ireland ](http://www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/1/schemes/cbd/contact/)
to check.
