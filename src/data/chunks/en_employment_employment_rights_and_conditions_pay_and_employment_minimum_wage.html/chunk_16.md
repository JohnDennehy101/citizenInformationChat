##  Living wage for all

A national living wage will replace the national minimum wage from 2026. The
living wage will be set at 60% of the median wage in any given year.

The national minimum wage will remain in place until the 60% living wage is
fully phased in. The national minimum wage will increase over the years as
usual.
