##  What counts as pay?

For the minimum wage, your gross wage (your total pay before any money is
deducted, such as tax or pension contributions) includes:

  * Your normal basic pay 
  * Any shift premium 
  * Any fee, bonus or commission 
  * Service charges given through the payroll 
  * Zero Hours payments 

If you get **food** (known as board) or **accommodation** (known as lodgings)
**from your employer** , the following amounts are included in the minimum
wage calculation:

  * Board rates: €1.14 an hour 
  * Lodging rates: €30 a week or €4.28 a day 

Employers must pay a minimum wage to work experience placements, work trials,
internships and any other employment practice involving unpaid work or working
for room and board.
