##  How to make a complaint

If you are not getting the minimum wage, you should speak with your employer
first.

If you cannot resolve the problem with your employer, you can complete the [
online complaint form
](https://www.workplacerelations.ie/en/complaints_disputes/refer_a_dispute_make_a_complaint/)
on [ workplacerelations.ie
](https://www.workplacerelations.ie/en/Complaints_Disputes/Refer_a_Dispute_Make_a_Complaint/)
.

This form gives you 2 options, you can:

  1. Request an investigation by an inspector from the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC). The inspector will investigate your claim that the minimum wage is not being paid. 
  2. Refer a dispute to a WRC adjudicator. However, you can only do this after asking your employer for a statement outlining the calculation of the average hourly pay. You must refer the dispute within 6 months of getting the statement. If necessary, the time limit can be extended to a maximum of 12 months. Where your employer has not given you the statement, the time starts from the date they should have (that is, within 4 weeks of the request). 

You cannot refer a complaint about the same dispute to both an adjudicator and
an inspector. This is set out in the National Minimum Wage Act.
