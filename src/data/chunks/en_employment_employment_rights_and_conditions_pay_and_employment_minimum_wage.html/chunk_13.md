###  Victimisation

If you ask your employer to pay the minimum wage, you are protected by law
from [ victimisation ](/en/employment/enforcement-and-redress/victimisation-
at-work/) or dismissal.

If you are dismissed for asking for the minimum wage, you can bring a claim
for [ unfair dismissal ](/en/employment/unemployment-and-
redundancy/dismissal/unfair-dismissal/) . You can do this no matter how long
you have worked for your employer or how many hours you work each week.

If you are due an increase under the National Minimum Wage Act, your employer
may try to cut your working hours to avoid an increase in the overall cost of
your pay. However, they cannot do this without also reducing your duties or
the amount of work.
