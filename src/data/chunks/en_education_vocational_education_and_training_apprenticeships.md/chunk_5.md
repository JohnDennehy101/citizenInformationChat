###  **New apprenticeships in other industries**

New apprenticeships introduced since 2016 lead to an award between Levels 5-10
on the National Framework of Qualifications. Each apprenticeship programme is
between 2 and 4 years.

There are a number of models of on-the-job and off-the-job training, as well
as different models of delivery and different target groups (including people
already in employment).

Industry-led groups (consortia), work with education and training providers
and other partners, to oversee the development and roll-out of new
apprenticeships.
