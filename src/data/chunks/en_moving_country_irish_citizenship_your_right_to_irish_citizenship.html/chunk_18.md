##  Citizenship by Irish descent or Irish associations

The Minster for Justice can waive some of the conditions of becoming an Irish
citizen where the applicant is of Irish descent or association.

This is at the discretion of the Minister. Irish descent or association means
that you are related by blood or adoption to an Irish citizen, or to someone
entitled to be an Irish citizen. If you are considering making an application
based on Irish descent or association, you should note the following:

  * You should have a reasonable period of legal residence in Ireland (at least 3 years) to show that you have a connection to Ireland. 
  * Applications based on descent from an Irish citizen going further back than a great-grandparent are generally refused. 
  * Applications based on being the parent or grandparent of an Irish citizen (by ‘ascent’), or a sibling, or other relative of an Irish citizen are generally refused. 
  * Applications based on Irish descent or associations can take up to 30 months to process.
