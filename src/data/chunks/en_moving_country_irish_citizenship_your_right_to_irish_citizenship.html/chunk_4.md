###  Irish citizenship in the Constitution of Ireland

The Constitution of Ireland is the basic law of the State and was adopted in
1937. It replaced the [ Constitution of the Irish Free State
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1922/act/1/enacted/en/print.html) .

The Constitution of the Irish Free State granted citizenship to anyone living
in the territory of the Irish Free State who:

  * At the time of the enacting of the constitution lived in the territory of the Irish Free State 

and

  * Was born in Ireland, or was the son or daughter of someone who was born in Ireland or 
  * Lived in Ireland for 7 years or more 

It did not give citizenship rights to anyone born after the enacting of the
Constitution of the Irish Free State. Instead, it said that this would be set
out in law.

When this was replaced by the [ Constitution of Ireland
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/cons/en/html) , anyone who was granted
citizenship of the Irish Free State under the provisions of the previous
Constitution became a citizen of Ireland. [ Article 9 of the Irish
Constitution ](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/cons/en/html#part2) says
that the future “acquisition and loss” of Irish citizenship would be done in
accordance with law.

The [ 19th Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1998/ca/19/enacted/en/print.html) was
passed following the Good Friday Agreement in 1998. This put the right to
citizenship by birth in the Constitution.

The [ 27th Amendment of the Irish Constitution
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2011/ca/29/enacted/en/html) was passed by
referendum in 2004. This removed the automatic right to citizenship by birth
for anyone born in Ireland after 1 January 2005 and gave authority back to the
Oireachtas (the Irish parliament) to decide on laws about citizenship by
birth.
