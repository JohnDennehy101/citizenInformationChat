##  Northern Ireland and Irish Citizenship

The Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956 gave people born in Northern
Ireland the right to claim Irish citizenship if they chose to do so.

The [ Good Friday Agreement ](/en/government-in-ireland/ireland-and-the-
uk/good-friday-agreement/) , which was signed between the Irish and British
governments in 1998, confirmed that people born in Northern Ireland could
choose to be either British or Irish citizens.

Since 1 January 2005, if you are born in Northern Ireland, you can claim Irish
citizenship if your parent (or parents) are either British or Irish citizens,
or one of them has lived on the island of Ireland for at least 3 out of the 4
years immediately before your birth.
