##  What happens if my application is not successful?

If your application is not successful, you can appeal the decision with the
local authority. You should write to them within 3 weeks of the decision,
giving the reasons why you are appealing.

Your appeal will be reviewed by someone in the local authority who was not
involved in assessing your application. The local authority will contact you
with the outcome of this review. This can take up to 6 weeks.
