###  Step 3 – Send contractor and payment information

  * Send information about the contractor to the local authority, for example, their tax reference number. 
  * Send your bank details to the local authority, so they know where to pay the grant. 
  * Send invoices for the completed work to the local authority. 
  * Get tax clearance from Revenue if the approved grant is over €10,000.
