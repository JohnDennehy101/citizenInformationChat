The grant does not cover completely demolishing a property and rebuilding a
new one.

It also does not cover work to make your home more energy efficient which is
already covered by an [ SEAI grant ](/en/housing/housing-grants-and-
schemes/grants-for-home-renovations-and-improvements/better-energy-homes-
scheme/) . You can apply to the SEAI for a grant for this work as well as
getting the Vacant Property Refurbishment Grant.

The Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage has published a
useful [ Bringing Back Homes
