##  What is the Vacant Property Refurbishment Grant?

The Vacant Property Refurbishment Grant provides funding so you can refurbish
vacant and derelict homes.

It can also be used to renovate vacant and derelict properties that have not
been used as residential properties before. However, this only applies if the
non-residential properties were used for commercial or public use before and
now have the correct planning permission.

You can get the grant if you are refurbishing the vacant property so you can
live there, or so you can rent the property out.

You can get a grant of up to €50,000 to renovate a vacant property and up to
€70,000, if the property is derelict. You can get more if you are living on an
off-shore island. And, there is an [ additional grant for expert conservation
advice ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/housing/housing-grants-and-
schemes/local-authority-housing-grants-and-supports/vacant-property-
refurbishment-grant/#22a660) if you are refurbishing a vacant traditional
farmhouse.

The Vacant Property Refurbishment Grant is funded by the Department of
Housing, Local Government and Heritage through the Croí Cónaithe (Towns) Fund
and you apply to your local authority.
