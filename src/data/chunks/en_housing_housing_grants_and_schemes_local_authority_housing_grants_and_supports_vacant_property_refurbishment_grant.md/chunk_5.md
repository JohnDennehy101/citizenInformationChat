##  How much is the Vacant Property Refurbishment Grant?

You can get up to €50,000 to renovate a vacant property and up to €70,000 if
the property is derelict. The grant is inclusive of the VAT cost of the works.

The grant amounts increased on 1 May 2023. If you applied for the grant before
the 1 May 2023 and you haven’t got your grant yet, the new grant amounts can
be applied. The [ FAQs about the grant

can get up to €84,000 to renovate a derelict building or up to €60,000 for a
vacant property. The limits for how much you can get for each type of work are
also increased by 20% if you live on one of these islands.

You can apply to the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) for the [
Better Energy Homes Grant Scheme ](/en/housing/housing-grants-and-
schemes/grants-for-home-renovations-and-improvements/better-energy-homes-
scheme/) . This grant helps improve the energy efficiency of your home, by
helping with the cost of insulating your home or installing a heat pump or
solar panels. Work covered by the SEAI scheme is not covered by the Vacant
Property Refurbishment Grant.

**The grant must be approved before any work begins.**
