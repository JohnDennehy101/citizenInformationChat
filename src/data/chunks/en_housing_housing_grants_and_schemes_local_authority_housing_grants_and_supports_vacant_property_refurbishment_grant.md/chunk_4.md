##  Do I qualify for the Vacant Property Refurbishment Grant?

To qualify for the Vacant Property Refurbishment Grant, you must meet the
following criteria:

  * The property must have been vacant for 2 years or more. You will not qualify if the property has been left unreasonably or purposely vacant so you can get the grant. 
  * The property must have been built before 2008. (Before 1 May 2023, only homes built before 1993 qualified.) 
  * You must own the property or be in the process of buying it. 
  * You must live in the property as your principal private residence when the work is completed or make it available for rent. If you are going to rent the property when the work is done, you must [ register the tenancy ](/en/housing/renting-a-home/landlords-rights-and-responsibilities/registering-a-tenancy/) with the Residential Tenancies Board. 
  * You must have tax clearance from Revenue and your tax affairs must be in order. 
  * You must have paid your [ Local Property Tax ](/en/money-and-tax/tax/housing-taxes-and-reliefs/local-property-tax/) , if applicable.

You can only get the grant twice. You can get one grant to refurbish a home to
live in, and another for a home you are going to rent out.
