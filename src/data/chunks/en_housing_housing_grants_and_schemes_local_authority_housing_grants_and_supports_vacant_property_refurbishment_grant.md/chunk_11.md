###  Step 4 â€“ Work is checked and charge document is signed

The local authority will send someone to your property to check that the work
has been completed as described and in-line with the costs.

If the local authority is happy with the work, they will ask you to sign a
charge document. The charge document gives the local authority rights over the
property as security for the grant. This is to ensure that you meet the
requirements of living in the property or renting it out for at least 5 years.

The charge placed on your property lasts for 10 years and is the same as the
grant amount you received. The local authority will register this charge
against the property with the [ Land Registry or Registry of Deeds
](/en/housing/owning-a-home/buying-a-home/property-deeds/) .
