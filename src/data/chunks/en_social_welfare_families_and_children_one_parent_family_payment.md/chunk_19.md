##  Education and training

You can keep your One-Parent Family Payment (OFP) if you are in education.

You may have the option to transfer to the [ Back to Education Allowance
(BTEA) ](/en/social-welfare/back-to-education/back-to-education-allowance/) or
to stay on your current payment and apply for a student grant. You need to
find out which option is of greatest benefit to you.

You cannot get BTEA and a student grant together. Find out more about [ social
welfare payments and student grants ](/en/social-welfare/back-to-
education/social-welfare-payments-and-the-student-grant/) .
