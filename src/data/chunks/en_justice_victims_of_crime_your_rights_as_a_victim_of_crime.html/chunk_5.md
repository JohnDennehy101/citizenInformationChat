###  What if I am a victim of crime abroad?

If you are a victim of crime while visiting another country, you should
contact a local [ Irish embassy or consulate for support ](/en/moving-
country/moving-abroad/leaving-ireland/diplomatic-supports/) . Depending on the
[ nature of the crime ](https://www.ireland.ie/en/dfa/overseas-
travel/assistance-abroad/victim-of-crime/) , you should also contact the local
police. A local Irish embassy or consulate can assist you in dealing with the
local police if necessary.

If you have since returned to Ireland, you can report the crime to An Garda
Síochána who will [ forward ](https://www.garda.ie/en/victim-
services/reporting-a-crime-faqs/) this to the appropriate police service.
