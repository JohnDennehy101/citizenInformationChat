###  What happens when I report a crime?

When you are reporting a crime, making a statement and being interviewed, you
have the right to bring a person of your choice with you for support. You can
also have a [ legal representative (solicitor) ](/en/justice/civil-
law/representation-in-court/) with you.

However, the Gardaí can ask you to pick a different support person or legal
representative if they think this is in your best interest, or if they think
the person you picked could interfere with the investigation.

After you have reported a crime, you have the right to get a written
acknowledgment of what you have reported. You will usually have the right to a
copy of any statement that you made to the Gardaí. You can get this by asking
the local [ Garda Victim Service Office ](https://www.garda.ie/en/victim-
services/garda-victim-service/) .

Even if you don’t report the crime, you are entitled to access [ support
services for victims of crime ](/en/justice/victims-of-crime/support-services-
for-victims-of-crime/) and to get information about these services.
