##  What are my rights while the crime is being investigated?

As part of the investigation, you may need to be interviewed and, depending on
the nature of the crime, medically examined. Any necessary interviews and
examinations should be kept to a minimum.

You can request information about significant developments in the
investigation, such as the arresting and charging of a suspect, and the Garda√≠
are obliged to provide this information.

However, you are not entitled to get any information that could:

  * Interfere with the investigation 
  * Endanger another person, or the security of the State 
  * Prejudice ongoing or future criminal proceedings 

If any property is taken from you as part of the investigation, you should get
it back without delay, if possible. However, if it has to be used as [
evidence ](/en/justice/evidence/evidence-introduction/) in a [ criminal trial
](/en/justice/criminal-law/criminal-trial/criminal-trial/) , you might not get
it back until the court case is finished.
