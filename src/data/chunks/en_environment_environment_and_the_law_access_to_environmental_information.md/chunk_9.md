###  **What can I do if I am refused access to information?**

The public authority must notify you of the refusal of your request generally
within 1 month. If you do not get a response within this time you can assume
that your request has been refused.

There are reasons when you can be legally refused access to environmental
information. However, if a public authority refuses your request for
information or has not dealt with your request appropriately, you can seek an
internal review of the decision made by the public authority.

If you require an internal review, you must request it within 1 month of
getting the decision.

If you are not satisfied with the outcome of the internal review you can
appeal to the [ Commissioner for Environmental Information (CEI)
](https://www.ocei.ie/) . You must appeal within 1 month of getting the
reviewed decision from the public authority. The CEI may extend the time limit
if he/she believes it is reasonable to do so.

Public authorities must comply with the CEI's decisions and if necessary the
CEI can apply to the High Court to have a decision upheld. The CEI's [
decisions are published on ocei.gov.ie ](https://www.ocei.ie/decisions/) .

You (or any other person affected by the CEIâ€™s decision) can [ appeal to the
High Court ](/en/environment/environment-and-the-law/judicial-review-in-
planning-and-environmental-matters/) on a point of law arising from that
decision. The CEI publishes further information on how to appeal.

See 'How to apply' below for more details on requesting an internal review or
making an appeal.
