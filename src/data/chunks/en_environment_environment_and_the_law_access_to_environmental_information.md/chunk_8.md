###  **Can I be refused access to environmental information?**

You may be refused access to some types of information. For example, you may
be refused information about the location of an endangered species if
disclosure of this information could put the species at risk. You may also be
refused access to draft or incomplete documents, internal communication (such
as internal emails) or material that is commercially sensitive. Further
details on exemptions are available in the [ guidance notes (pdf)
](https://assets.gov.ie/76998/4d6c5e83-b377-493e-92c6-c76de9d2e0d8.pdf) . In
general, you cannot be refused information about emissions into the
environment.

A request for information using the AIE Regulations can be refused if the
information is required to be made available under any other statutory
provision - for example, where a planning authority is required to publish the
information or make a planning file available.
