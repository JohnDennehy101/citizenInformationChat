##  Introduction

You have the right to obtain certain environmental information from a public
authority.

To get access to environmental information you can use [ Freedom of
Information (FOI) ](/en/government-in-ireland/how-government-works/standards-
and-accountability/freedom-of-information/) legislation or the [ European
Communities (Access to Information on the Environment) Regulations 2007 to
2018 (AIE Regulations) ](https://www.gov.ie/en/organisation-
information/1e52cb-access-to-information-on-the-environment-aie/#aie-
legislation) . These Regulations give effect in Ireland to the [ AIE Directive
](http://eur-
lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2003:041:0026:0032:EN:PDF) ,
which was adopted to give effect to the Access to Information pillar of the [
Aarhus Convention ](/en/environment/environment-and-the-law/aarhus-
convention/) .

As well as giving you the right to access environmental information, the AIE
Regulations also oblige public authorities to be proactive in disseminating
environmental information to the public. Public authorities must inform the
public of their rights and provide information and guidance on exercising
those rights. They must also make reasonable efforts to maintain environmental
information and have it in a form that is accessible and can be reproduced.

You can read the [ guidance notes (pdf)
](https://assets.gov.ie/76998/4d6c5e83-b377-493e-92c6-c76de9d2e0d8.pdf) on the
implementation of the AIE Regulations public authorities must have regard to.
