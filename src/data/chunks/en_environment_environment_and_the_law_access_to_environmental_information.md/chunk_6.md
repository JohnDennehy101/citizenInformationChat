###  How will my request be handled?

The public authority must respond to your request as soon as possible and
generally within 1 month of having received it. It should offer assistance to
enable you to make a request, particularly if you have literacy difficulties
or a disability.

If the request is complex or a large volume of information is required, the
authority must write to you within a month and inform you of its difficulties
processing your request. It must also give you a date by which it will
respond, which must be not more than 2 months after it got your original
request.

The AIE Regulations require public authorities to designate information
officers to maintain registers or lists of the environmental information held,
or else provide an information point to indicate clearly where such
information can be found. Public authorities must also register and process
all requests for the environmental information that they hold.
