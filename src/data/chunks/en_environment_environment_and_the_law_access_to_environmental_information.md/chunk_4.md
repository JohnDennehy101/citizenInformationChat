###  **What is a public authority?**

A public authority is any body or organisation that has a role in public
administration and that possesses environmental information. The definition of
public authorities under the AIE Regulations is broader than under FOI
legislation. This means if an authority is not covered by FOI, you may still
be able to get access to environmental information using the AIE Regulations.
Public authorities, for the purposes of AIE Regulations, include [ government
departments ](https://www.gov.ie/en/organisations/#departments) , [ local
authorities ](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/942f74-local-authorities/) ,
commercial and non-commercial State agencies and regulatory bodies. The
President and certain other offices are now excluded from the definition of
“public authority” for AIE purposes.

If a body or organisation denies your request for environmental information on
the basis that it is not a public authority, you can query this decision,
following the steps outlined below - see ‘What can I do if I am refused access
to information?’.
