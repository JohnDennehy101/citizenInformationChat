###  **CCMA and tracker mortgages**

If you are in arrears or pre-arrears, your lender must not make you change
from an existing tracker mortgage to another type of mortgage as part of an
alternative arrangement. However, this may be allowed if none of the options
that would allow you to keep the tracker interest rate are appropriate and
sustainable for you.

You should get independent financial or legal advice if you have a tracker
mortgage and your lender is offering you an alternative repayment arrangement
that means you will have to change to another mortgage type.
