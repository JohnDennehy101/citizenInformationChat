##  What protections do I have if I am struggling to pay my mortgage?

Lending institutions like banks and building societies must follow certain
rules when dealing with you if you are struggling to pay your mortgage.

The [ Central Bank's Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears (CCMA)
](https://www.centralbank.ie/docs/default-source/Regulation/consumer-
protection/other-codes-of-conduct/24-gns-4-2-7-2013-ccma.pdf) applies if you
are in difficulty on a mortgage on your primary residence.

Local authorities must follow similar rules if you are struggling to repay a
local authority home loan.

The [ Consumer Protection Code 2012 ](https://www.centralbank.ie/docs/default-
source/regulation/consumer-protection/other-codes-of-conduct/4-gns-4-2-7-cp-
code-2012.pdf) applies to other types of loans, such as credit cards, personal
loans or buy-to-let mortgages.

[ The Money Advice and Budgeting Service (MABS) also has information on
engaging with your lender ](https://mabs.ie/mortgage-arrears/engaging-with-
