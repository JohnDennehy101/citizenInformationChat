###  **What are the CCMA rules lenders must follow?**

The CCMA sets out the framework that lenders must use when dealing with
borrowers in mortgage arrears or pre-arrears. Lenders must handle these cases
sympathetically and positively, with the goal of helping people to meet their
mortgage obligations.

Under the CCMA, lenders must have:

  * A [ **Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process (MARP)** ](/en/housing/owning-a-home/mortgage-arrears/mortgage-arrears-resolution-process/) . This must be used when dealing with customers in arrears and pre-arrears. 
  * An **Arrears Support Unit** (ASU) to assess arrears and pre-arrears cases 
  * An internal **Appeals Board** to consider appeals
