##  What rules apply if my mortgage is sold?

Since 21 January 2019, if your lender sells your mortgage to another company,
[ the new company must be regulated by the Central Bank
](https://www.oireachtas.ie/en/bills/bill/2018/21/) . So, the protections of
the CCMA and Consumer Protection Code continue to apply to your mortgage.

However, before this the rules were different. From 2015 to 21 January 2019,
if an unregulated firm bought your mortgage loan [ they had to appoint a
credit servicing firm to act on their behalf.
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2015/act/21/enacted/en/html) Credit
servicing firms were regulated by the Central Bank and needed to adhere to the
CCMA and Consumer Protection Code, just like the original lender.

Before 2015, if your lender sold your mortgage to a third-party firm who was
not regulated by the Central Bank, you could lose the protections under the
CCMA and Consumer Protection Code.
