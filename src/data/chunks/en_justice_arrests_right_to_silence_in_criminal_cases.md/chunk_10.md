###  **When failure or refusal to provide information may not be used**

If no other [ evidence ](/en/justice/evidence/evidence-introduction/) is put
to the court or jury, then they cannot convict you on your failure or refusal
to answer questions alone.

It can only be used in connection with other evidence presented to the court
or jury in the case which supports your guilt. For example, your failure to
answer questions about why you were in a particular place can be used along
with other evidence connecting you to a crime committed in that place.

  * Your refusal or failure to provide information cannot be used in court: 
  * If the Garda did not inform you in ordinary, clear, understandable language what the effect of a failure or refusal might be, and 
  * You were not given a reasonable opportunity to consult a solicitor. 

The questioning must be recorded electronically or you must consent in writing
to it not being recorded.
