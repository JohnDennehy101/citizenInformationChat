##  Your right to silence in Garda custody

If you are arrested and brought to a Garda station, the arresting Garda must
inform you of your general right to remain silent during questioning. This is
done by way of a caution which states:

“You are not obliged to say anything unless you wish to do so but anything you
say may be taken down in writing and may be used in evidence”.

The constitutional right to silence will not extend to not answering police
questions such as your name, address, your date of birth or nationality unless
this information is self-incriminating in some way.
