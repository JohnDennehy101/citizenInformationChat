##  Introduction

If you are arrested in Ireland, the Irish Constitution (or Bunreacht na
h√âireann) provides:

  * A protection against self-incrimination (making a statement that might now or later expose you to criminal proceedings) 
  * A guarantee that everyone accused of a criminal offence is innocent until proven guilty 

The protection against self-incrimination and the right to silence are
associated with the presumption of innocence.

When you are charged with a criminal offence, the responsibility of proving
your guilt lies with the prosecution. No responsibility generally lies with
you, (the accused) to prove your innocence.

There are two exceptions to this rule:

  * Where a particular law requires you to prove or give evidence of something relating to the possible offence. For example, if you are charged with possession of drugs and the prosecution proves that you actually had the drugs. It is then a legal requirement for you to prove that you did not know that they were drugs. Otherwise, you may be convicted. 
  * Where you offer a defence of insanity or diminished responsibility (this is where you are charged with murder but suggest that you were suffering from a mental disorder but were not legally insane). It is then up to you to prove your insanity or diminished responsibility.
