##  Can inferences be drawn from your silence?

An inference is where someone reaches a logical conclusion based on the facts
before them, for example, if you are seen running away from a crime scene,
someone might infer that you may have been involved in a crime.

Inferences can be drawn from your silence in certain circumstances in any
proceedings against you for an arrestable offence under the Criminal Justice
Act 1984 as amended by Part 4 of the [ Criminal Justice Act 2007
](https://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2007/act/29/enacted/en/html) .

An arrestable offence is an offence for which a person can be imprisoned for 5
years or more.

Circumstances in which inferences can be drawn include:

  * **If you fail or refuse to account or explain for something** : Inferences can be drawn, if at any time before being charged or when you are charged, or when informed by a Garda that you may be prosecuted for the offence, you fail or refuse to account for any object, substance or mark on your person, clothing or in your possession or in any place in which you were when questioned by a Garda. 
  * **If you fail or refuse to account for your presence at a location** : Inferences can be drawn if you fail or refuse to account for your presence at a particular place around the time the offence was committed. The Garda has to have a reasonable belief that the presence of the object, substance or mark, or your presence at the place, has a relevance to your involvement in the offence which is believed to have been committed. 
  * **If you fail to mention a certain fact** : Inferences may also be drawn if you fail to mention any fact which you then rely on in your defence during the proceedings and which, in the circumstances existing at the time, you could reasonably have been expected to mention when being questioned or charged. 

It is not an offence to fail or refuse to answer such questions but the court
or jury can take into consideration (when deciding on your guilt or innocence)
the fact that you had failed or refused to answer the questions when asked by
the Garda√≠.
