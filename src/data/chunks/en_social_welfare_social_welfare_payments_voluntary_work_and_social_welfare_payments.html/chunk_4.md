##  Carer’s payments and volunteering

To qualify for a carer’s payment you must be providing full-time care. If you
are getting Carer’s Allowance or Carer’s Benefit, you can do a maximum of 18.5
hours per week of voluntary work. Before you start working as a volunteer, you
must get permission from the [ Carer’s Allowance ](/en/social-
welfare/carers/carers-allowance/) or [ Carer’s Benefit ](/en/social-
welfare/carers/carers-benefit/) section in the Department of Social
Protection.
