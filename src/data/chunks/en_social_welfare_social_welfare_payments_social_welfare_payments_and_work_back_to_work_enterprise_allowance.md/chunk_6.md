###  Extra benefits

You can keep your extra (or secondary) benefits for as long as you are getting
the BTWEA. Extra benefits include:

  * [ Fuel Allowance ](/en/social-welfare/extra-social-welfare-benefits/fuel-allowance/)
  * [ Medical card ](/en/health/medical-cards-and-gp-visit-cards/medical-card/)
  * [ Back to School Clothing and Footwear Allowance ](/en/social-welfare/families-and-children/back-to-school-clothing-and-footwear-allowance/)
  * [ Rent Supplement ](/en/social-welfare/supplementary-welfare-schemes/rent-supplement/)

However, if you are getting Rent Supplement, you can only keep it if you are
deemed eligible for the [ Rental Accommodation Scheme ](/en/housing/local-
authority-and-social-housing/rental-accommodation-scheme/) . Your Rent
Supplement may be affected if your earnings go up while you are on the BTWEA
scheme. You should check with the [ DSP's representative ](/en/social-
welfare/supplementary-welfare-schemes/community-welfare-services-and-
payments/) to see how your Rent Supplement may be affected by your
participation in the BTWEA scheme.

**When you are getting the BTWEA**

The Back to Work Enterprise Allowance is paid directly into your bank or
building society account each week. The allowance  cannot be paid  into a
mortgage account.

**You do not have to pay tax, PRSI or Universal Social Charge** on the Back to
Work Enterprise Allowance but you may have to pay tax, PRSI and Universal
Social Charge on any income you get from self-employment.

You must contact the DSP immediately if your self-employment ends or you take
up employment.
