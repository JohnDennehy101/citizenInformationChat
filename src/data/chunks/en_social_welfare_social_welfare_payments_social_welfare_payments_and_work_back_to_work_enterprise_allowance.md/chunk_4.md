###  Help with starting a business

In addition to income support (your weekly payment), you can also get
financial support with the costs of setting up your business. These supports
are provided under a scheme called the [ Enterprise Support Grant (ESG)
](https://www.gov.ie/en/service/52fb76-enterprise-support-grant/) .

You can only get the ESG if you have been approved for the BTWEA. The business
plan you submit as part of your application for the scheme must set out the
rationale and requirement for financial support. The ESG can pay a total of
€2,500 in any 24-month period. You must be able to make a matching
contribution of at least 10% to access grant support. You need to provide
documentary evidence of the costs (quotations from at least 2 suppliers or, if
a single supplier, the reasons for choosing a single supplier).
