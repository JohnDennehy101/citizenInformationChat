##  What does the European Parliament do?

The European Parliament has 3 roles:

  * It debates **legislation** . It can pass or reject laws, and it can also make amendments (but not in all cases). Laws must also be passed by the Council of the EU in order to become law. If the law is about EU budgets, the Parliament can only advise on it â€“ it does not have the power to reject the law. You can read more about [ how EU laws are made ](/en/government-in-ireland/european-government/eu-law/how-eu-law-works/) . 
  * It **supervises** EU institutions and budgets. The president of the EU Commission must be approved by Parliament, and the Commission must answer written or oral questions during Question Time. 
  * It establishes an EU **budget** (along with the Council of the EU). 

Unlike most national parliaments, the European Parliament cannot initiate
legislation. The European Commission is the only EU institution with the power
to initiate (or start) new laws. The Parliament can ask the Commission to
initiate laws.
