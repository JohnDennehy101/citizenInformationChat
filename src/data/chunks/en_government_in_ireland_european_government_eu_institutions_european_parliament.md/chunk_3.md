##  The President and MEPs

The Parliament elects its own president, along with 14 vice-presidents for a
term of 2.5 years. The president represents the Parliament to other EU
institutions.

The number of MEPs for each member state is loosely based on the population of
the member state. No country can have fewer than 6 MEPs or more than 96 MEPs.
Ireland has 13 MEPs.

MEPs join groups, or can sit as independent MEPs. For a group to be
recognised, it must have at least 25 MEPs representing at least one quarter of
EU member states.
