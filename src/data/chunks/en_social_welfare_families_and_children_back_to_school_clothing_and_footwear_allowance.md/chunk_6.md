[ Foster children ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/birth-family-
relationships/adoption-and-fostering/fostering/) do not qualify for the BSCFA.
This is because foster parents get a [ Foster Care Allowance

and-fostering/fostering/#60a83b) , which includes help with the cost of
clothing and footwear for the child.
