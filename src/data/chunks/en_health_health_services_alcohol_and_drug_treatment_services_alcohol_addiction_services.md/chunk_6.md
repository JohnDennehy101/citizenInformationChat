###  Residential programmes

Residential treatment takes you away from your usual environment and access to
alcohol or drugs. Treatment is provided on an in-patient basis in a specialist
facility. Programmes will generally have a small number of participants. Talk
to your GP or local addiction service about your options and appropriate
referral to residential treatment.
