Addiction services that are provided by the HSE are public services and out-
patient services are free of charge.

There may be a charge for residential programmes. However, these charges are
often on a sliding scale and your ability to cover the fees should not be a
barrier to you accessing the service. A medical card may cover stays in
selected drug treatment centres. If you have health insurance, contact your
insurer to find out if treatment costs are covered.
