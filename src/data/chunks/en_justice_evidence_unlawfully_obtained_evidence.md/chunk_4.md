###  Evidence collected in breach of your constitutional rights

Evidence that is collected in a "deliberate and conscious" breach of your
constitutional rights cannot be presented in court, except in exceptional
circumstances. "Deliberate and conscious" means that the Gardaí or officers
involved knew that the evidence was collected in breach of your constitutional
rights.

For example, if Gardaí found evidence when searching your home, knowing they
didn’t have a valid search warrant, they would have collected this evidence in
breach of your constitutional rights.

However, evidence obtained inadvertently in breach of your constitutional
rights may be allowed in court. However, the prosecution must prove that
mistake made was inadvertent.

For example, if Gardaí found evidence when searching your home, not knowing
that there was a minor defect in the search warrant, then this evidence may
possibly be allowed.
