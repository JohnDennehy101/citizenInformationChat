###  Getting copies of archives

[ Copies of the archives ](https://www.nationalarchives.ie/visit-us/obtain-
copies-of-archives/) are available at the National Archives. These are
generally in the form of photocopies, copies from microforms (small-scale
images of the original document) or copies from digital images.

You are not able to make copies of the archives yourself, although if you ask
for permission from the Archivist on Duty you may be able to take digital
photographs for your personal use. You can order copies in the Reading Room by
e-mail or through the post. You can collect them or have them posted to your
address. The National Archive provides a [ summary of the fees
](https://www.nationalarchives.ie/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Summary-of-
fees.pdf) for copies on their website.
