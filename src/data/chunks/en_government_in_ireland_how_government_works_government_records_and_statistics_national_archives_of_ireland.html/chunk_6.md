###  In person

Documents cannot be removed from the National Archives building, but you can
inspect them in the Reading Room. The Reading Room is open to all members of
the public, although you will need to apply for a Reader’s Ticket when you
arrive.

Currently it is necessary to book a time in advance. Reader's tickets are free
and last for three years. You can apply for a Reader’s Ticket on your first
visit. You should bring:

  * A photo ID, such as a driver’s license or passport 
  * Proof of your address, such as a utility bill 

In order to look at the archives you will have to sign the ‘Rules for Readers’
which are written to provide a comfortable working environment for readers and
to keep the archives safe.

If are interested in an archive that is held in off-site storage you should [
order it in advance ](https://www.nationalarchives.ie/visit-us/ordering-
archives-in-advance/) . You will need to know the correct reference code and
place the order at least 3 days before your visit. You cannot advance order
archives that are held onsite.
