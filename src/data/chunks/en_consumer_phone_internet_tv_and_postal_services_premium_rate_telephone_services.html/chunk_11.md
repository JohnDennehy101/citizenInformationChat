###  Advertising of premium rate services

Advertisements for premium rate phone services on TV, print media and radio
and online must meet standards to protect consumers.

For example:

  * A premium rate service can’t be promoted as being "free" 
  * A product or service can’t be described as "free" if you can only get it by using a premium rate service
