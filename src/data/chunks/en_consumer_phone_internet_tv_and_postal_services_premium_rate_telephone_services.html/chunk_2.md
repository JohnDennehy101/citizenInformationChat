##  What are premium rate services?

Premium rate phone services (sometimes called _Information Services_ ) have a
unique ‘15’ prefix, for example, 1530 or 1515.

Premium rate means the numbers cost more to call or text than other numbers.

Examples of premium rate phone services include:

  * TV voting 
  * Charity donations 
  * Quizzes and competitions 
  * Advice and entertainment services 
  * Ringtones and wallpapers 

There are also premium rate SMS services (known as PSMS) and these have a
5-digit Short Code beginning with the number 5.

Premium rate phone services in Ireland are regulated by [ ComReg (Commission
for Communications Regulation) ](http://www.comreg.ie/) .
