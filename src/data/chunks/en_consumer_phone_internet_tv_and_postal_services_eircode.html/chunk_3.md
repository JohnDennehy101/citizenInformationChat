##  How do I use an Eircode?

The Eircode should be placed at the end of the normal address, just below the
county.

For international post to an Irish address, the Eircode should go between the
county and country details.

It is not mandatory to use the Eircode. However, many businesses ask you for
your Eircode, especially for delivering goods or services to your address.
