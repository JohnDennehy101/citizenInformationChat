##  Rules

To claim an Increase for a Qualified Adult (IQA) you must be getting a social
welfare personal payment.

The [ habitual residence condition ](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-
system/social-assistance-payments/habitual-residence-condition/) does not
apply to increases for qualified dependents (spouses, civil partners,
cohabitants or children). This means that dependents do not have to satisfy
the habitual residence condition in their own right. For example, the
qualified dependant may be an asylum seeker if the normal conditions are met.

An IQA is not normally payable on behalf of a spouse or civil partner who is
absent from the State or in prison. However Jobseeker's Benefit claimants can
claim an IQA for an adult dependent living in another EEA state if the
dependent adult meets the criteria. You can find more information about [

welfare-payments/) .
