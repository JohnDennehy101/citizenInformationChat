###  How your Increase for a Qualified Adult is paid

If you qualify for an increase in your social welfare payment for an adult
dependant it will be paid directly to you as part of your main payment.
However, if you both consent, you can have the Increase for a Qualified Adult
paid directly to your adult dependant.

In some cases, if there are difficulties in the home, (for example, gambling
or alcohol abuse) an adult dependant can have more than just the Increase for
a Qualified Adult paid directly to him or her without your consent. [ This
generally happens as a result of an investigation by a Social Welfare
Inspector ](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/aa4d0f-operational-guidelines-
separate-payments/) .

If you apply for the State Pension (Contributory) or State Pension (Non-
Contributory) the Increase for a Qualified Adult will automatically be paid
directly to your adult dependant. However, your adult dependant may choose to
have it paid with your payment instead.

If you are currently getting a State Pension (Contributory) and wish to apply
for an Increase for a Qualified Adult for your spouse, civil partner or
cohabitant you should fill in [ form SPCQA1(pdf)
