##  Employing workers on your farm

**Before hiring workers for your farm**

Before you hire anyone to work on your farm, you need to be clear about why
you are employing them. You also need to be sure that your business needs
additional labour and that you can afford to pay for them.

Teagasc has a guide that gives advice on the hiring process: [ Teagasc Farm
Labour Manual – Best Practice in Recruiting and Managing Employees
](https://www.teagasc.ie/media/website/publications/2017/Teagasc-Farm-Labour-
Combined-Book.pdf) .

**Being an employer**

If you are employing people to work on your farm, you must know [ your
responsibilities as an employer
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/employment/employment-rights-and-
conditions/employment-rights-and-duties/employer-obligations/) and make sure
your workers get their basic [ employment rights
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/employment/employment-rights-and-
conditions/pay-and-employment/minimum-wage/) .

For example, you must:

  * Pay at least the [ minimum wage ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/employment/employment-rights-and-conditions/pay-and-employment/minimum-wage/) and provide your workers with payslips 
  * Make sure your workers get a written statement with the terms and conditions of their employment 
  * Make sure your workers get the correct breaks, rest periods and annual leave 
  * Ensure your workers’ [ safety, health and welfare at work ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/employment/employment-rights-and-conditions/health-and-safety/health-safety-work/) , as far as is reasonably practicable 
  * Keep records of the wages you’ve paid, working hours and other information 
  * Deduct the correct amount of tax, PRSI and Universal Social Charge from your employees’ wages and send it to Revenue 

If you employ someone aged between 14 and 18, they are considered a ‘young
worker’ and have specific rights and protections. You can [ find out more
