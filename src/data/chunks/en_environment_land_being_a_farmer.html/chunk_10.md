##  Taxation for farmers

You are taxed on the profits you make from your farm business and on any other
income you have. Farm profit is the income you earn from farming less your
allowable farming expenses. You are responsible for keeping records and for
assessing the amount of tax due each year.

If you are farming as an individual, you have to pay income tax on your
profits. If you are farming through a company, you have to pay [ Corporation
Tax ](https://www.revenue.ie/en/companies-and-charities/corporation-tax-for-
companies/corporation-tax-payment-and-filing/index.aspx) (CT) on your profits.

You must pay and file your income or corporation tax return each year before
the deadline using the Revenue Online Service (ROS).
