###  **Getting a herd number**

If you are going to keep animals on your farm, you may need a herd number.
These are issued by your [ Regional Veterinary Office (RVO)
](https://www.gov.ie/en/organisation-information/9dc27-contact-us/#regional-
offices) and help to manage diseases in animals.

You also need a herd number to qualify for many of the [ farming grants and
schemes ](/en/environment/land/farming-grants-and-schemes/) . However, scheme
entitlements do not automatically transfer when you change the name on a herd
number. You need to transfer any entitlements separately.

You will need a herd number if you have:

  * Cows 
  * Sheep 
  * Goats 

To qualify for a herd number, [ you must meet certain criteria
](https://www.gov.ie/en/service/f90f21-application-for-a-flockherd-
number/#what-you-must-do) . For example, you must be over 18 and your land
must be properly fenced.

Getting a herd number means you are responsible for the care of the animals
under that herd number. You are seen as the herd keeper; though you do not
have to own animals or land to have a herd number.
