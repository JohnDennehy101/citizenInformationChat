##  Farm inheritance

There are different steps involved in inheriting a farm.

You can transfer your farm while you are alive, or you can arrange to have it
transferred after you die. To do this, you will need to [ make a will
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/death/before-a-death/making-a-will/) .

If you don’t make a will, your assets will be shared out following the
standard rules. These rules state:

  * Your spouse gets two thirds of your assets 
  * Your children get a third 

This may not suit you if for example, you are planning to transfer your farm
to a child.
