##  Starting out in farming

Farming is a varied career and lifestyle. As well as it being your job, you
may also be a business owner, employer and caretaker of the land. And you may
have to work unsociable hours, depending on the type of farming you do.

If you are starting out farming, you may be:

  * [ Inheriting a farm ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/environment/land/farm-succession-planning/#2a56cb) from a relative 
  * Buying a farm 
  * Working on someone elseâ€™s farm 

If you are in school and thinking about a career in farming, you should talk
to your school guidance counsellor about courses.

You can also contact [ Teagasc ](https://www.teagasc.ie/) or the universities
that offer farming courses to find out about farming courses and
apprenticeships.

You could also consider working on a farm as a seasonal worker, for example,
during the summer holidays. This is a great way to get experience on a farm to
see if you enjoy it, before you sign up to a course or apprenticeship.
