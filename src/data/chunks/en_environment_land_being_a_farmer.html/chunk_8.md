##  Social welfare supports for farmers

There are some social welfare payments for farmers that you may be able to get
depending on your situation:

  * [ Farm Assist ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/farming-and-fishing/farm-assist/) – a means-tested social welfare payment for farmers with a low income 
  * The [ Rural Social Scheme ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/farming-and-fishing/rural-social-scheme/) for low-income farmers, fishermen and fisherwomen. This scheme gives you a ‘top-up’ payment on your social welfare payment in return for providing services that benefit your community. 

**Other social welfare supports**

You may also qualify for other social welfare supports which are not
specifically for farmers, such as:

  * [ Fuel Allowance ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/extra-social-welfare-benefits/fuel-allowance/)
  * [ Back to School Clothing and Footwear Allowance ](http://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/social_welfare_payments_to_families_and_children/back_to_school_clothing_and_footwear_allowance.html)
