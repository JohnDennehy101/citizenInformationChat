###  Special care order

The High Court can grant a special care order or an interim special care order
when a child needs special care and protection and is unlikely to get it
unless such an order is made.

The court may make a special care order if:

  * The child is at least 11 years old 
  * The child's behaviour poses a real and substantial risk to their own health, safety, development or welfare, and 
  * The child needs special care and protection which they are unlikely to get without such an order 

A special care order means that the child is committed to Tusla's care. It
authorises Tusla to provide appropriate care, education and treatment and, if
necessary, to detain the child in a special care unit. The order will
initially be for a period of up to 3 months but may be extended.

An interim special care order may be made before the normal procedure for a
special care order is complete. If an interim special care order is made, the
child may be placed in a special care unit for up to 28 days.
