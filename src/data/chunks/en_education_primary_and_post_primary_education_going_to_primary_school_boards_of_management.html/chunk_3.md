##  Why does a school have a board of management?

Under the Education Act 1998, the patron of the school must, where it can,
appoint a board of management.

The composition of the board of management should be agreed between school
patrons, national associations of parents, school management organisations,
teacher representatives and the Minister for Education.

The board is appointed by the patron. When the patron appoints a board it must
comply with Ministerial directions about gender balance. The board must also
follow the [ Governance Manual for Primary Schools
](https://www.gov.ie/pdf/?file=https://assets.gov.ie/34186/31f98d651a6147ef91d781fa3805ccc7.pdf)
.

If the patron decides that it is not able to appoint a board, they must give
reasons to the parents, teachers, staff and the Minister but they cannot be
forced to appoint one.
