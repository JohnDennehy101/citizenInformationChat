##  Introduction

Each minister of the Government is responsible for running and managing the
department they have been allocated. There are 18 government departments. As
well as the Cabinet minister assigned to the department, The Taoiseach may
also appoint junior ministers, or Ministers of State to help run departments.

Each department employs a large number of [ civil servants ](/en/government-
in-ireland/how-government-works/national-government/the-civil-service/) ,
including a Secretary General, who remain in their positions regardless of
changes in the Government. These officials advise and assist the minister in
the running of the department.
