##  The current law on hate speech in Ireland

The [ Prohibition of Incitement to Hatred Act 1989
](https://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1989/act/19/enacted/en/print.html) sets
out the law on hate speech.

It says that it is an offence to communicate threatening, abusive or insulting
material that is intended, or likely to, “stir up” hatred against a group of
people because of their race, colour, nationality, religion, ethnic or
national origins, membership of the travelling community or sexual
orientation.

The communication can be spoken, in writing, broadcast or part of a recording.

If the person did not intend to stir up hatred, they can defend a charge by
proving that they did not know the content of the material, and had no reason
to suspect that the material was threatening, abusive or insulting.
