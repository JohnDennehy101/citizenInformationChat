##  Proposed changes to the law

New proposed laws on hate speech have been published and are currently being [
debated in the Oireachtas ](/en/government-in-ireland/houses-of-the-
oireachtas/legislation/) . The [ Criminal Justice (Incitement to Violence or
Hatred and Hate Offences) Bill 2022
](https://www.oireachtas.ie/en/bills/bill/2022/105/) will (if enacted):

  * Create new laws to deal with hate crimes 
  * Expand the protected characteristics to include gender (including gender identity and expression) and disability 
  * Make it an offence to deny or trivialise genocide 

A hate crime is any criminal offence which is perceived by the victim, or any
other person, to have been motivated by prejudice based on a personâ€™s age,
disability race, colour, nationality, ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation,
or gender. Ireland does not currently have specific laws that deal with hate
crimes.

The new law will replace the Prohibition of Incitement to Hatred Act 1989.
