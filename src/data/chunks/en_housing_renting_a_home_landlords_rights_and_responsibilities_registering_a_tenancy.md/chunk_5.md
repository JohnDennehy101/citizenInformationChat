##  What information do I need to register a tenancy?

The tenant must give their details to the landlord, including their [ Personal
Public Service number (PPS number) ](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-
system/personal-public-service-number/) so the landlord can register the
tenancy.

Private landlords and approved housing bodies must provide the following
information when registering:

  * The address of the rented home 
  * The name, address and PPS number of the landlord (or registered number, if a company) 
  * The approved housing body (AHB) number, if a housing association 
  * The name and PPS number of each tenant 
  * A description of the property (for example, a 2-reception, 3-bedroom semi-detached house) 
  * The date the tenancy started 
  * The rent and how often it is paid 
  * The local authority area the property is in 
  * The term of the lease if it is a fixed-term lease 
  * If it is a sub-letting 
  * The [ Building Energy Rating (BER) ](/en/housing/owning-a-home/home-owners/getting-a-building-energy-rating-for-your-home/) if applicable 
  * Details of any management company or authorised agent 

The RTB website has [ a checklist of the information you need to provide when
registering a tenancy ](https://www.rtb.ie/register-a-tenancy/how-to-register-
a-tenancy) .

The RTB needs additional information when registering student-specific
accommodation, so it uses a slightly different process. For more information
about registering student-specific accommodation see the [ RTBâ€™s website
](https://www.rtb.ie/registration-and-compliance/registrations/student-
specific-accommodation) .
