###  Exemptions from annual registration fees

There is no fee if you have to register a new tenancy for rented accommodation
that has already been registered in the last 12 months. This only applies if
you register the new tenancy within a month of the start of the tenancy.

Before annual registration, tenancies were registered each time a new tenancy
began. For example, when new tenants moved in under a new lease. An ongoing
tenancy was also re-registered after 6 years. This is known as a ‘ [ Further
Part 4 ](/en/housing/renting-a-home/types-of-tenancy#lef263) ’ tenancy.

There is a temporary exemption from annual registration fees for landlords who
have ‘Further Part 4’ tenancies. This means they do not have to pay annual
registration fees for the time remaining on their ‘Further Part 4’ tenancy.
So, if there are 3 years left on a ‘Further Part 4’ tenancy, the landlord does
not have to pay annual registration fees for those 3 years. The tenancy must
still be registered annually.

This temporary annual registration fee waiver is set out in the [ Residential
Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2021
