##  Making a complaint about a PSP and getting compensation

Anyone can make a complaint against a licensed PSP about [ improper conduct
](https://www.psr.ie/consumers-information/investigation-of-complaints/) ,
which happened when the PSP was providing a property service. These complaints
should be made in writing to the PSRA.

There are [ minimum standards (pdf) ](https://www.psr.ie/wp-
content/uploads/2022/03/SI-Minimum-Standards-Regulation-Plain-English-
Guide.pdf) and a [ Code of Practice (pdf) ](https://www.psr.ie/wp-
content/uploads/2022/04/PSPs-Code-of-Practice.pdf) which outline how PSP’s
should behave when delivering their services. These are used when
investigating complaints.

Information about [ how complaints are investigated
](https://www.psr.ie/consumers-information/investigation-of-complaints/) , and
how to use the [ complaint form (pdf) ](https://www.psr.ie/wp-
content/uploads/2023/01/PSRA-Complaint-Form-0123.pdf) is available on the [
PRSA website ](http://www.psr.ie/) .

The PRSA manages a [ compensation fund ](https://www.psr.ie/consumers-
information/compensation-fund/) , which is funded by the property services
sector. This fund provides compensation to people who have used a licensed PSP
and have incurred losses because of the dishonesty of a licensed PSP.

To make a claim for compensation, the PSP must have had a valid licence when
the property service was provided.

For more information, read the [ PSRA’s guide to making a claim

Claims-03-21.pdf) .
