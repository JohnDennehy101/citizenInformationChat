##  What is a PSRA licence?

A PSRA licence is a licence granted by the PSRA to a Property Service Provider
(PSP). All PSPs must have a PSRA licence. A PSP can only provide the service
or services that they have a licence for. The PSRA keeps and publishes a
register of all licensed property services providers.

The register lists certain details about the PSP, such as their:

  * Name 
  * Number 
  * Licence type 
  * Location 

There are 4 different licence types:

  * **Type A** \- The auction of property other than land (for example, fine art, antiques, animals) 
  * **Type B** \- The purchase or sale (by auction or private treaty) of land (including buildings) 
  * **Type C** \- The letting of land (including buildings) 
  * **Type D** \- Property management services 

PSPs can apply for their licences online at [ prsalicences.ie
](https://www.psralicences.ie/ILAS) . Licences are valid for 1 year and must
be renewed annually.

The PRSA has published a [ Guide to becoming a licensed property services
provider (pdf) ](https://www.psr.ie/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Guide-to-
becoming-a-PSP.pdf) to help PSPs understand the requirements of being licensed
and how to complete the application forms.

**How do I know if a PSP is licensed?**

You can check if a PSP is licensed by the PSRA by:

  * Checking the [ Register of Licensed Property Service Providers ](https://www.psr.ie/psra-registers/register-of-licensed-property-services-providers/)
  * Asking to see the property services provider's PSRA licence card 
  * Looking for the PSRA business licence, which must be on display in the PSPâ€™s office or at an auction 

Using a licensed PSP gives you consumer protection. It is illegal to provide a
property service without a licence. PSPs trading without one can be:

  * Sanctioned 
  * Fined 
  * Imprisoned 

If you think a PSP is providing a property service without a licence, you
should report this to the PRSA at info@psr.ie.
