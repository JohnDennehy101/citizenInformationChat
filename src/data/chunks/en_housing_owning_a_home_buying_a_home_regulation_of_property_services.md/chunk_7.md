##  What is the Commercial Leases Register?

The PSRA maintains and publishes the [ Commercial Leases Register
](https://www.propertypriceregister.ie/website/npsra/pprweb-com.nsf/page/ppr-
home-en) , which contains information about all commercial leases entered into
since 1 January 2010. Commercial leases include:

  * Office leases 
  * Retail leases 
  * Industrial leases 
  * Most agricultural or land leases 

Almost all leases where stamp duty is paid to the Revenue Commissioners are
commercial leases.

If you are a tenant (person, company, organisation or public body) of a
commercial lease, you must make a Commercial Lease Return to the PSRA when
starting a new lease. This is a statutory requirement. A Commercial Lease
Return can be made free of charge using a [ Commercial Lease Return Form
](https://www.propertypriceregister.ie/Website/NPSRA/pprweb-com.nsf/PSRA-
CL117?OpenPage) .

The purpose of the Commercial Leases Register is to provide transparency in
the commercial rental market. It may be helpful if you are about to begin a
commercial lease, because it lets you view the cost of similar leases.

The PSRA have a [ fact sheet on the Commercial Lease Return Form (pdf)

You can also contact the Commercial Leases Unit of the PSRA on
commlease@prsa.ie for more information about making a return.
