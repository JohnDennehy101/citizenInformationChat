###  Payments for dependants

If you have dependants, your Parent’s Benefit rate is compared to the rate of
Illness Benefit (including increases for dependants) that would be paid to you
if you were absent from work through illness. The higher of the 2 rates is
paid to you.

Although the Illness Benefit rate begins from a lower personal base amount
(€232 is the maximum Illness Benefit personal rate), it takes into account
extra payments for your family. This is why, depending on the circumstances of
your spouse, civil partner or cohabitant and how many children you have, you
may get a higher rate of Illness Benefit.

If your adult dependant (your spouse or partner) is getting a social welfare
payment you will not get an [ Increase for a Qualified Adult (IQA)
](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/claiming-a-social-welfare-
payment/claiming-an-increase-in-your-social-welfare-payment-for-an-adult-
dependant/) but you may get a half-rate [ Increase for a Qualified Child (IQC)
](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/claiming-a-social-welfare-
payment/claiming-and-increase-in-your-payment-for-a-child-dependant/) .

You will qualify for a full-rate IQA and a full-rate IQC, if your adult
dependant is unemployed and signing on for credits or is earning under €100.01
per week.

If your adult dependant is earning between €100.01 and €310 per week you will
get a tapered rate of IQA and a full-rate IQC. If your adult dependant is
earning between €310.01 and €400 per week you will not get an IQA but you will
get half rate IQC. If your adult dependant earns over €400 per week you will
not get an IQA or IQC.
