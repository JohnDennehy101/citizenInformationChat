###  Insurance from employment in another country

If you had insurable employment in a country covered by EU Regulations and you
have paid at least one full rate PRSI contribution in Ireland, you may combine
your insurance record in that country with your Irish PRSI contributions to
help you qualify for Parentâ€™s Benefit.

More information is available in our document about [ combining your social
insurance contributions from abroad ](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-
