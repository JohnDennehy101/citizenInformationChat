###  Leave certification

You must declare that your parent’s leave dates have been approved by your
employer when you apply for Parent’s Benefit. The Department of Social
Protection (DSP) may contact your employer asking them to confirm the dates.

If you are self-employed, you self-certify your leave and declare that you
will not engage in any employment during your parent’s leave.

If you are applying for Parent’s Benefit for an adopted child, you need a [
certificate of placement for the child
](https://www.tusla.ie/services/alternative-care/adoption-services/) . If the
adoption is an intercountry adoption and took place outside the State, you
need a declaration of eligibility and suitability and confirmation of the day
of placement or expected day of placement in writing.

If you decide not to take parent’s leave, you cannot get Parent’s Benefit. You
should tell the Parent’s Benefit section of the Department about any changes
to your parent’s leave arrangements.
