####  Can a landlord and tenant agree a shorter notice period?

You and your landlord can agree a shorter notice period than the minimum
periods set out above, but you can only do so when the landlord decides to
terminate the tenancy. It is illegal to agree a shorter notice period at the
start of the tenancy.

You and your landlord can also agree a longer notice period, but the maximum
is 70 days when the tenancy has lasted less than 6 months.
