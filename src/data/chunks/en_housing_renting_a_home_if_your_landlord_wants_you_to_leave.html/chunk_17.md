###  If your landlord wants to change the use of the property

If your landlord wants to change the use of the property the landlord must
include a statement setting out the nature of the change in writing, with the
notice of termination. The notice must confirm that any necessary planning
permission has been received. The RTBâ€™s [ sample notice of termination due to
change of use (docx)
](https://www.rtb.ie/images/uploads/old/Registration/Notice_of_Termination_-
_Change_of_use_0212-23.docx) contains the required information.

If the landlord ends your tenancy because they are changing its use, and the
property then becomes available for rent again, the landlord must offer it
back to you. This must be done within 12 months of the expiry of the tenants
notice period.
