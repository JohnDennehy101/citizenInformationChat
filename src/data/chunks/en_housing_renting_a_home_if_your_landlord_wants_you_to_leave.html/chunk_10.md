###  Requirement to offer property back to the tenant

If your landlord ends your tenancy for one of the below reasons and the
property then becomes available to rent again, the landlord must offer the
property back to you within 12 months of the expiry of your notice period.

They must do this if they ended your tenancy because they:

  * Planned to sell the property within 9 months 
  * Needed the property for their own use or for an immediate family member 
  * Planned to change the use of the property 
  * Planned to refurbish the property substantially 

Your landlord must make every reasonable effort to get your contact details,
so they can offer the property back to you. This includes contacting the RTB
to ask for them. The RTB may have your contact details to give to the landlord
or they may contact you to get them. The RTB will only pass your details to
the landlord if you have given your consent to do this.

When your landlord contacts you to offer to re-let the property to you, you
have 7 days to accept or reject this offer.

[ The RTB website has a step-by-step guide to this procedure
