##  Notice of termination

If your landlord wants you to leave, they must serve you with a valid written
notice of termination. The notice can be posted to you, be given to you in
person or be left for you at your address. Emails and text messages do not
qualify as valid notices of termination. If it appears that you are not living
in the property, the landlord can affix the notice to the outside of the
property.

Your landlord must also send a copy of the notice of termination to the
Residential Tenancies Board (RTB). This must be done at the same time as it is
sent to you. It can be emailed to [ NoticeofTermination@rtb.ie
](mailto:NoticeofTermination@rtb.ie) or posted to the RTB along with the [ RTB
Notice of Termination Return Form (pdf)
](https://www.rtb.ie/images/uploads/forms/RTB_Notice_of_Termination_Return_Form_Nov_2022.pdf)
.

If this is not done, the notice of termination is invalid. The RTB recommends
that landlords use certified post when posting the notice of termination to
the tenant and the RTB, and that they keep proof of this.

When the RTB receives the notice of termination it will:

  * Write to you and your landlord about the RTB services and outline your rights and responsibilities under residential tenancies legislation 
  * Ask for your contact details in case the landlord needs them to offer the property back to you. This will only be done with your consent 

This requirement is in place since 6 July 2022, when it was brought in under
the Regulation of Providers of Building Works and Miscellaneous Provisions Act
2022.
