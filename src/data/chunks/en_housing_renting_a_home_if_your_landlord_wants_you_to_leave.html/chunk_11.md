###  **Restriction on terminating tenancies when selling multiple properties**

A landlord cannot terminate a tenancy of more than 6 months if they intend to
sell 10 or more dwellings in a development within a 6-month period, unless:

  * They can show that the market value with a sitting tenant is over 20% below the market value with vacant possession, and 
  * Preventing them from terminating the tenancy would be unduly onerous on them or would cause them undue hardship 

This provision is often called the ‘Tyrrelstown’ amendment and it is provided
for under [ Section 40 of the Planning and Development (Housing) and
Residential Tenancies Act 2016
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2016/act/17/enacted/en/print#sec40) .
