####  Not keeping your tenant obligations

If you are not keeping your obligations, your landlord must send you a warning
notice before they can issue a notice of termination. The warning notice must
outline what obligations have been broken and give you a reasonable amount of
time to fix the issue. This warning notice does not need to be copied to the
RTB. If you do not resolve the issue, the landlord only needs to give you 28
days’ notice of termination. This applies to all tenancies, regardless of the
length of the tenancy.

However, if your behaviour is seriously anti-social or threatens the fabric of
the property, the landlord only needs to give you 7 days’ notice and does not
have to give you a warning notice. [ Section 17 (1) (a) and (b) of the 2004
Act
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2004/act/27/section/17/enacted/en/html#sec17)
sets out the type of seriously anti-social behaviour for which a 7-day notice
may be allowed.
