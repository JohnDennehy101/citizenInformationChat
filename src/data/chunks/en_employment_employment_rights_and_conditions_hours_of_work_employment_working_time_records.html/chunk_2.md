##  Introduction

Your employer must keep detailed records of the hours you work each day and
week. They must also keep a record of any leave, rest periods and breaks you
take.

However, some employers are exempt from recording rest periods – see
‘Exemptions’ below.

Employers can record your working time electronically (for example, using a
clock-in system), or using an [ OWT1 form (doc)
](https://www.workplacerelations.ie/en/Publications_Forms/Form_OWT1.doc) (or
similar).

An inspector from the [ Workplace Relations Commission
](/en/employment/enforcement-and-redress/enforcement-employment-rights-
legislation/) can get full access to these records.
