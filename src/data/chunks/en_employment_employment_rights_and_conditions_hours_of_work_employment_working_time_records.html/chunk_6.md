##  If you cannot take your break or rest period

If you are unable to take a break or rest period in your job, you must **tell
your employer, in writing, within one week** . You must include the reason why
you did not take the break.

Your employer must:

  * Look at the reasons why you were unable to take your break 
  * Examine any health and safety issues that have (or might have) arisen relating to you and your job 
  * Allow you to take the rest break that you were due as soon as possible 

If you do not take your break when this is offered, you are at fault and your
employer is not obliged to offer you another break.
