##  Exemptions from keeping records of rest periods

Your employer does not have to record your breaks and rest periods if they use
electronic record-keeping (such as clock-in facilities) or manual record-
keeping (such as the OWT1 form).

However, they must meet one of the following criteria:

  * They tell you in writing about [ your entitlement to breaks and rest periods ](/en/employment/employment-rights-and-conditions/hours-of-work/work-breaks-and-rest-periods/)
  * They tell you the terms of your [ collective agreement or employment regulation order ](/en/employment/employment-rights-and-conditions/industrial-relations-and-trade-unions/employment-agreements-and-orders/)
  * They have a written procedure on how you must let your employer know if you are unable to take a rest period or break. You must include the reason why you could not take the rest break. 

Your employer must keep:

  * Written evidence they have told you of your entitlement to rest breaks 
  * Written evidence they have told you that, if any rest breaks are not taken, you must let them know in writing 
  * Records of all notifications sent by you in relation to your working time.
