##  What is a Police Certificate?

A Police Certificate is an official statement about you issued by [ An Garda
Síochána ](/en/justice/law-enforcement/garda-siochana-national-police-force/)
.

It is used by people who have lived in Ireland and want to work or study
abroad. It is required by some foreign authorities.

A Police Certificate states your:

  * Name 
  * Address 
  * Date of birth 
  * Criminal record in Ireland (this does not include [ adult cautions ](/en/justice/law-enforcement/adult-cautioning-scheme/) ) 

A Police Certificate is normally valid for 1 year.

You should also note that the Irish [ spent convictions legislation
](/en/justice/criminal-law/spent-convictions/) cannot be used to prevent
disclosure when you are required to disclose information about your criminal
convictions to another state.
