##  What to expect from An Garda Síochána

The Gardaí will assess the level of risk and determine the best course of
action. There are different types of missing person cases and the Gardaí may
involve other agencies, such as the HSE, Mountain Rescue teams or Civil
Defence where necessary,

You should expect your report to be fully investigated. The investigation
starts when you first make your missing person report.

The Gardaí may issue a press release with details of the missing person if
they believe this will assist in their enquiries. Where a child is missing and
abduction is suspected, the Gardaí may issue a Child Rescue Alert.
