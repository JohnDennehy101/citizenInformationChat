###  **What should I include in my appeal?**

Your appeal must include:

  * Your name and address 
  * The name and address of a planning agent, if you are using one 
  * Details about the planning application so An Bord Pleanála can identify the right application. For example: 
    * A copy of the planning authority decision 
    * The name of the planning authority and the planning register reference number 
  * Your grounds for appealing and any supporting material and arguments. These must relate to planning issues only. The Board cannot take other issues into consideration. 
  * The correct fee 
  * The acknowledgement from the planning authority that confirms you made a submission or observations on the application, if you are a third-party applicant. This can be a copy of the acknowledgement. 

If you do not submit all the documentation or you have not met all the
criteria for an appeal, your appeal will be considered [ invalid
](https://www.pleanala.ie/en-IE/Invalid-planning-appeals) and will not be
considered by An Bord Pleanála.
