####  Child Benefit

Over 2 years the rates of payments of Child Benefit will be standardised for
all children.

Child Benefit will be maintained at €140 per month for each of the first 2
children. The rates for the third and subsequent children will be standardised
at €140 per child per month over the next 2 years.

The rate for the third child will be €148 and for the fourth and each
subsequent child will be €160. (January 2012)

The additional monthly payment for twins and triplets will be maintained but
the grant of €635 paid at birth, at 4 years of age and at 12 years of age for
these multiple births will cease. (January 2012)
