####  Mortgage interest relief (MIR)

Mortgage interest relief will no longer be available to house purchasers who
purchase after the end of 2012 and will be fully abolished from 2018, as
previously announced.

First time buyers in 2012 will get mortgage interest relief at 25% for the
first two years, 22.5% for years 3 and 4 and 20% for years 6 and 7. For first
time buyers the upper thresholds for tax relief are €20,000 for people who are
married, in a civil partnership or widowed and €10,000 for people who are
unmarried and not in a civil partnership.

Non-first time buyers in 2012 will get mortgage interest relief at 15%. The
upper thresholds for non-first-time buyers for tax relief are €6,000 for
people who are married, in a civil partnership or widowed and €3,000 for
people who are unmarried and not in a civil partnership.

The rate of mortgage interest relief will be increased to 30% for first time
buyers who took out their first mortgage between 2004 and 2008.
