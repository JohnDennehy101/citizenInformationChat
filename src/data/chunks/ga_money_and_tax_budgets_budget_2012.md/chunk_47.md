####  Carer's Allowance

New applicants for Carer’s Allowance, who are not living with the person for
whom they are providing care, will not be entitled to the Household Benefits
package. The person receiving care may be entitled to the Household Benefits
package in their own right. (April 2012)

Carer’s Allowance weekly rates of payment will not change. The half-rate
Carer’s Allowance will continue to be paid to people who are full-time carers
and who are getting another welfare payment. The extra payment for caring for
more than one person is retained. Carers will continue to get the annual
Respite Care Grant of €1,700 for each care recipient.
