####  Qualified Child Increases

If a person claiming Invalidity Pension, Carer's Benefit, State Pension
(Contributory or Transition) or Incapacity Supplement has a spouse or partner
with income of over €400 a week, payment of the half-rate qualified child
increase will be discontinued. This will apply to new claimants and is in line
with current arrangements for Jobseeker's Benefit, Illness Benefit and Injury
Benefit. (July 2012)

Payment of 2 qualified child increases where the person is on a Community
Employment Scheme _and_ One Parent Family Payment, Deserted Wife’s
Allowance/Benefit or Widow(er)’s Pensions will cease for new and existing
recipients.
