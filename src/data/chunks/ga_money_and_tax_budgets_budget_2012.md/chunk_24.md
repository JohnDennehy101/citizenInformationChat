####  Personal Retirement Savings Accounts (PRSAs)

The provisions which apply to ARFs will also apply on the same basis to
'vested' PRSAs, where the assets are retained in the PRSA rather than being
transferred to an ARF. This includes an increased deemed distribution
percentage of 6% for vested PRSAs with assets in excess of â‚¬2 million. Further
details will be published in the Finance Bill. (31 December 2012 and future
years)
