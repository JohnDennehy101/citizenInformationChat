###  **Cork, Galway and Limerick**

Cork, Galway and Limerick run their own city-wide bike sharing schemes. Bikes
are available for rent at docking stations around the city. An annual
subscription costs €10 with 3-day passes for €3. The first 30 minutes of your
bike ride is free and hourly charges apply afterwards.

See [ bikeshare.ie ](https://www.bikeshare.ie/) for more details on where to
find the bikes and how to sign up for the bike share scheme.
