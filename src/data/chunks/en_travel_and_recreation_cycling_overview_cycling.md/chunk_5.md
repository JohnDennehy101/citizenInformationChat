##  Bike sharing schemes

If you donâ€™t bring a bike on your journey, you can combine public transport
with bike hire at your destination. A bike sharing scheme allows you to use
bikes affordably and take or leave them at various docking stations across a
city.

Ireland has many private bike hire companies with information available
locally. There are 5 major bike share schemes.
