###  Local authority housing

Local authorities provide social housing for older people in the same way as
they do for everyone else. However, they generally take age into account when
prioritising applications for housing.

Some local authorities also provide specific housing for older people. This
housing is usually accessible and may provide additional supports so people
can continue to live independently. This type of accommodation is often called
supported accommodation. Each local authority has a specific waiting list for
this type of accommodation.

The local authority allocates housing in accordance with its own housing
allocation scheme. Contact your local authority for information about their
housing allocation scheme and any specific accommodation for older people in
your area.
