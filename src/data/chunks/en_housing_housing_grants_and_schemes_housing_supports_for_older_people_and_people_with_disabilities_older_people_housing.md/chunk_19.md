###  Security measures for older people

The [ Seniors Alert Scheme ](/en/justice/crime-and-crime-prevention/seniors-
alert/) provides funding for a free personal monitored alarm. A personal
monitored alarm is an alarm that connects you to a national helpline, which is
open 24 hours a day. You wear the alarm around your wrist or neck and when you
press the button it automatically rings the helpline where someone can send
help to you.

You can get the grant if you are:

  * Aged 65 or over 
  * Living alone, or only with other older people 
  * Unable to buy the equipment yourself 

After the first year, you need to pay an annual monitoring fee.  

This scheme is managed by Pobal who provide funding to community and voluntary
organisations to install the personal alarms. If you are eligible for the
Seniors Alert Scheme, you should contact the group registered to operate the
scheme in your area. Pobal publishes a list of [ registered organisations on
its website ](https://www.pobal.ie/programmes/seniors-alert-scheme-sas/) .
