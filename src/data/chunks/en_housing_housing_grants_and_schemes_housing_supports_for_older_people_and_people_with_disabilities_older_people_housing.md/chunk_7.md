##  Housing supports for older people

If your home becomes unsuitable, perhaps because you have become sick or less
mobile, you may start thinking about different housing options and supports.
You may consider:

  * Adapting your home so itâ€™s more accessible 
  * Getting supports so you can stay in your home 
  * Moving to a more suitable home 
  * Moving to a nursing home
