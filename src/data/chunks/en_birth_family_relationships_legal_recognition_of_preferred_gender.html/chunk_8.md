###  If you have changed your name

If you want your gender recognition certificate to be issued in your new name
(a different name to that on your birth certificate), you must provide details
of the forename and surname you wish to use.

**Please note:** The current GRC 1 form states ‘If you wish to have a name
other than that on your original birth certificate shown on the Gender
Recognition Certificate, we require evidence of “use and repute” over two
years or a Deed Poll for a change of name which has been enrolled in the High
Court.’ This form is currently being reviewed. In the meantime, it is **no
longer a requirement** to provide proof that you have used this new name for
over 2 years, or a [ deed poll for a change of name. ](/en/birth-family-
