##  Coding in

In some cases, income from other sources can be _coded in_ against your tax
credits and [ standard rate cut-off point ](/en/money-and-tax/tax/income-
tax/how-your-tax-is-calculated/) . Coding in means that Revenue will reduce
both your tax credits and your standard rate cut-off point to match the tax
due on your other income. This means that the tax due on your other income is
collected under PAYE. This happens with [ taxation of social welfare payments
](../../../social_welfare/irish_social_welfare_system/claiming_a_social_welfare_payment/taxation_of_social_welfare_payments.en.html#l7096a)
, for example.
