You may be [ required to file online ](https://www.revenue.ie/en/starting-a-business/registering-for-tax/mandatory-electronic-payment-of-taxes-and-filing-of-tax-returns.aspx) but you can [ apply to be excluded from the requirement to file online ](https://www.revenue.ie/en/starting-a-business/registering-for-tax/exclusion-from-mandatory-electronic-filing.aspx) . 
  * Fill out the [ paper Form 11 (pdf) ](http://www.revenue.ie/en/self-assessment-and-self-employment/documents/form11.pdf) and send it to Revenue. 

Revenue also provide [ a guide to self-assessment on their website
](http://www.revenue.ie/en/self-assessment-and-self-employment/guide-to-self-
assessment/index.aspx) and information and video guides on [ filing your tax
return ](https://www.revenue.ie/en/self-assessment-and-self-employment/filing-
your-tax-return/index.aspx) .

If you use ROS to make your tax return online, it will calculate your self-
assessment based on the information you provide. You can choose to accept this
calculation or input your own self-assessment.

If you use the paper Form 11, it includes a self-assessment section which you
(or your agent) must complete and sign. If you file the paper tax return
early, before 31 August, Revenue will complete the self-assessment section on
your behalf.
