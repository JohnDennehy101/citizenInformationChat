###  Can I earn non-PAYE income without having to use self-assessment?

If you are a PAYE taxpayer and you also have non-PAYE income, you do not have
to use self-assessment if that income is:

  * Net taxable income of under €5,000 (after losses, capital allowances and other reliefs) and 
  * Coded in against PAYE tax credits (see below) or fully taxed at source and 
  * Gross income of less than €30,000 

Although you are not a chargeable person for self-assessment, you still have
to inform Revenue of this income. See below for [ How to make a tax return if
you do not have to use self-assessment

comply-with-your-tax-obligations/#f0ee0f) .
