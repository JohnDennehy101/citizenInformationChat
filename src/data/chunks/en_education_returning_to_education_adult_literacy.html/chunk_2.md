##  What is literacy?

Literacy is more than just reading and writing. Literacy skills include:

  * Listening 
  * Speaking 
  * Using numbers 
  * Using everyday technology 

We all need literacy skills to communicate, access services, and make informed
choices. Literacy skills help us to enjoy a good quality of life within our
families, in our communities, and at work.
