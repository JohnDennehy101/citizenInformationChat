##  Junior Cycle subjects

There are many [ Junior Cycle subjects
](https://www.curriculumonline.ie/Junior-cycle/) , but all subjects are not
offered in every school.

All students must study Irish (unless you have an [ exemption from studying
Irish) ](/en/education/the-irish-education-system/exemption-from-irish/) ,
English, Maths and History. Depending on your school, other subjects may also
be compulsory.

English, Irish and Maths are studied at either ordinary or higher level. All
other subjects are studied at common level. The classroom-based assessments in
second and third year are also set at common level.
