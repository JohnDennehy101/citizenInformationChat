###  The Junior Certificate School Programme

The [ Junior Certificate School Programme (JCSP)
](https://www.curriculumonline.ie/junior-cycle/junior-cycle-subjects/the-
junior-certificate-school-programme/) is designed to help young people who are
at risk of leaving school early and who would benefit from special support
when they are working towards the Junior Cycle exams.

Students taking the Junior Cycle exams study the normal Junior Cycle syllabus.
All students participating in the Junior Certificate School Programme must be
entered for the Junior Cycle exams. All JCSP students are entitled to a
profile - this is an individualised record of their achievement.
