##  The laws on safety belts

The law in Ireland requires the following vehicles to have seat belts:

  * Passenger vehicles that accommodate fewer than 8 people (excluding the driver) 
  * Passenger vehicles that accommodate more than 8 passengers and have a gross vehicle weight of less than 3,500 kg 
  * Goods vehicles that have a gross vehicle weight of less than 3,500 kg 

All buses transporting children must be fitted with the appropriate seat belts
or restraint systems for the number of children being transported. This does
not apply to general public bus services. Passengers in buses fitted with seat
belts must be informed of the requirement to wear them.

Under the [ Road Traffic (Construction, Equipment and Use of Vehicles)
(Amendment) Regulations 1971
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1971/en/si/0096.html) , the [ Road Traffic
(Construction, Equipment and Use of Vehicles) (Amendment) Regulations 1991

European Communities (Compulsory Use of Safety Belts and Child Restraint
Systems in Motor Vehicles
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2006/en/si/0240.html) ), the majority of
people travelling in motor vehicles in Ireland are required to wear a seat
belt or child restraint at all times.
