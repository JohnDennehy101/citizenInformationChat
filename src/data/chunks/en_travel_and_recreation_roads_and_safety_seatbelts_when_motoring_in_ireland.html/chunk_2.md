##  Introduction

Each year in Ireland, many people are hurt, seriously injured, or killed on
our roads. Some of these injuries and deaths could have been prevented if
drivers and passengers had been adequately restrained by [ seat belts or child
restraint systems ](https://www.rsa.ie/road-safety/road-users/vehicle-
components/vehicle-components/seatbelts-and-child-restraints) .

If seat belts are fitted, they must be worn by both drivers and passengers.
The driver is responsible for ensuring that passengers under 17 are suitably
restrained.

This page provides an overview of the law regarding the wearing of seat belts
and child restraints in motor vehicles. It also provides information on groups
of people exempted under the law.
