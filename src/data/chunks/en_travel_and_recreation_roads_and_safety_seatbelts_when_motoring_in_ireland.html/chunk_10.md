##  Fines and penalty points

You can be fined €120 if you do not wear a seat belt. You must either pay this
fine within 28 days or face an increased fine of €180 payable within 56 days
of the offence. Three penalty points will be added to your licence if you
choose to pay the fine and not to go to court. However, if you are convicted
in court for not wearing a seatbelt, five penalty points will be added to your
licence and you will be fined €2,000.
