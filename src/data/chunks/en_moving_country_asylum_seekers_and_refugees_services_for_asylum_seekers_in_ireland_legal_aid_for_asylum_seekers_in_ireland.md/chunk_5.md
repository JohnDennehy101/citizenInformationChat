##  How much do I pay towards my legal costs?

To qualify for legal services, your income (less certain allowances) must be
below a set amount. You can read more about the general means assessment for [
civil legal aid and advice
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/justice/legal-aid-and-advice/civil-
legal-advice-and-legal-aid/) .

If your only income is the [ Daily Expenses Allowance ](/en/moving-
country/asylum-seekers-and-refugees/services-for-asylum-seekers-in-
ireland/direct-provision/) and you have less than €4000 in savings and assets,
you will be asked to pay a contribution of €10 for legal aid to help with your
claim for asylum or subsidiary protection. If you can’t pay this, you can
request that the fee is waived on hardship grounds.
