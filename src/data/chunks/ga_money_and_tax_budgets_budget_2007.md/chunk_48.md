###  Extension of stamp duty relief for farm consolidation

Stamp duty relief for exchanges of farmland between two farmers for the
purposes of consolidating each farmerâ€™s holdings was introduced on 1 July 2005
for a period of two years. The relief is being extended for a further two
years to 30 June 2009. The relief will also be extended to qualifying
exchanges of land where only one farmer is consolidating his/her holding. In
such cases both farmers can qualify for relief, provided both farmers meet all
other conditions of the relief.
