###  Environment (Farming / Rural Economy)

Additional funding for the Bio Heat scheme of grants (for commercial wood
burning boilers), to cover the installation of other technologies such as
solar panels in commercial premises and for buildings in the non-commercial
sector such as community centres and sports.  
  
There are also a number of tax measures in the environment area.  
  
A package of rural development measures was agreed as part of Towards 2016.
This package will involve a doubling of Government support for farming in the
next rural development period compared to the present one.  
  
New schemes of aid for re-structuring in the food processing sector underpin
the adaptation of the agriculture and food sector to the realities in EU and
world farming.  
  
Forestry premiums have increased by 15%, REPS payments have increased by 17%.  
  
There will be substantial support for on-farm investment to help meet the
requirements of the Nitrates Directive, reflecting the important role that
farmers play in protecting the environment.  
  
There are also a number of tax measures and improvements in tax reliefs.  
  
Some of these measures will require EU state-aid approval before they are
implemented.
