###  Doctors

Medical doctors in Ireland are regulated by the [ Medical Council
](https://www.medicalcouncil.ie/) .

The Medical Council can investigate [ complaints
](https://www.medicalcouncil.ie/complaints/) about a doctor’s fitness to
practise medicine. If the complaint is serious and raises concerns over a
doctor’s fitness to practise, the Council can restrict the doctor’s
registration. This could remove their right to practice medicine in Ireland.
The Medical Council has more information about [ making a complaint about a
doctor (pdf) ](https://www.medicalcouncil.ie/Public-Information/Making-a-
Complaint-/Making-a-complaint-about-a-doctor.pdf) .
