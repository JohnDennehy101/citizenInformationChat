##  Capacity to marry

For your marriage to be legally valid in Ireland, you must both have the
capacity to marry each other. This means you and your future spouse must meet
all of the following requirements at the time the marriage takes place. You
must:

  * Be over 18 years of age. This is the case even if either person lives in Ireland but you marry outside of Ireland. Even if you are not ordinarily resident in the State, you must be over 18 years of age to marry someone in Ireland. 
  * Freely consent to the marriage. This means you cannot be forced to marry someone. 
  * Observe the necessary marriage formalities. For example, you must have contacted the [ Civil Registration Service ](https://www2.hse.ie/services/births-deaths-and-marriages/contact-a-civil-registration-service.html) and, unless exempted, given the marriage Registrar 3 months' [ notice of your intention to marry ](/en/birth-family-relationships/getting-married/notification-requirements-for-marriage/) , and been issued with a Marriage Registration Form. If your civil partnership was registered in Ireland, you do not have to give the 3 months' notice. 
  * Be either single, widowed, [ divorced ](/en/birth-family-relationships/separation-and-divorce/divorce-decrees/) , a former civil partner of a civil partnership that ended through death or [ dissolution ](/en/birth-family-relationships/separation-and-divorce/getting-a-dissolution/) , or have had a [ civil annulment of a marriage ](/en/birth-family-relationships/problems-in-marriages-and-other-relationships/nullity-of-marriage/) or civil partnership or a valid foreign divorce or dissolution. (If you are marrying your civil partner you do not need to have your civil partnership dissolved before marrying. It will be automatically dissolved when you marry.) 
  * Have the mental capacity to understand the nature of marriage 
  * Not be related by blood or marriage to a degree that legally prohibits you from marrying each other. If you are related to your proposed spouse by blood or by marriage, you should [ contact a solicitor ](http://www.lawsociety.ie/Pages/Find-a-Firm/) to ensure that you do not fall within the prohibited degree of relationship. (See 'If you are related by blood or marriage' below.) 

If you do not meet even one of the above requirements, then any subsequent
marriage ceremony is legally void (invalid).
