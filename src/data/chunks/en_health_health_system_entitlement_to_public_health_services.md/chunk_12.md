###  **How to apply for a medical card if you are from another EU country**

You can complete and submit a [ medical card application form
](https://assets.hse.ie/media/documents/Medical_Card_Application_Form_-
_English.pdf) and the relevant S form.

You will get an [ S form
](https://europa.eu/youreurope/citizens/work/unemployment-and-benefits/social-
security-forms/index_en.htm) in your country to confirm that you are part of a
health insurance scheme in another EU/EEA country or Switzerland. If your
country confirms that you are entitled to healthcare in Ireland, you do not
need to complete a financial assessment for a [ medical card
](/en/health/medical-cards-and-gp-visit-cards/medical-card/) form.

See the [ medical card assessment guidelines (pdf)
](https://www.hse.ie/eng/staff/pcrs/medical-card-and-gp-visit-card-assessment-
guidelines.pdf) for more information about entitlement under EU Regulations.
