##  What is ordinary residence?

If you are coming to live in Ireland or returning here to live, you must
satisfy the Health Service Executive (HSE) that you are ordinarily resident â€“
that you have been living in Ireland for at least a year or you intend to live
here for at least one year.

To check that you are ordinarily resident the HSE may ask for:

  * Proof of property purchase or rental, including evidence that the property is your principal residence (for example, proof of rent from the local authority) 
  * A letter or statement from a financial institution (for example a bank statement or credit union statement) 
  * A current utility bill (such as a gas, electricity or phone bill) 
  * A current car or home insurance policy in your name 
  * An official document from a government department (for example, a notice of assessment from Revenue or proof of rent from the Housing Assistance Payment Scheme) 

The above documents must be dated within the last 12 months.

Any person, regardless of nationality, who is accepted by the HSE as being
ordinarily resident in Ireland is entitled to either full eligibility
(Category 1, [ medical card ](/en/health/medical-cards-and-gp-visit-
cards/medical-card/) holders) or limited eligibility (Category 2) for health
services.
