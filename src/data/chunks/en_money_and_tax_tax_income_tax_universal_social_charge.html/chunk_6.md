###  Redundancy payments

[ Statutory redundancy payments ](/en/employment/unemployment-and-
redundancy/redundancy/redundancy-payments/) are exempt from the charge.
Statutory redundancy payments amount to 2 weeks’ pay per year of service plus
a bonus week, subject to a maximum payment of €600 per week. In addition,
redundancy payments above the statutory redundancy amount are exempt from the
Universal Social Charge, up to certain limits. These limits are up to €10,160
plus €765 per complete year of service in excess of the statutory redundancy.
This basic exemption can be further increased by up to €10,000 if the person
is not a member of an occupational pension scheme.

The Universal Social Charge is charged on liable income after the statutory
exemptions above, and after any additional deduction for [ Standard Capital
Superannuation Benefit (SCSB) ](/en/employment/retirement/income-tax-in-
retirement/retirement-lump-sum-taxation/) .
