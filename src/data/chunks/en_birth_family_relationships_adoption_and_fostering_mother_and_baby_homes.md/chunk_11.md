##  Dignified burial

The [ Institutional Burials Act 2022
](https://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2022/act/18/enacted/en/html) was signed
into law on 13 July 2022. The Act provides for the excavation, exhumation and,
where possible, identification of remains (where possible) where there have
been inappropriate burials at the sites of former mother and baby homes.

Any remains exhumed will be re-interred and given a dignified and respectful
burial.

In March 2023, the [ Office of Director of Authorised Intervention
](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/8fdcb-legislation/) was established to
lead and manage an intervention (under the Act) at the site of the former
Mother and Baby Institution at Tuam, Co Galway.
