##  Why do I need a BER certificate?

Your BER certificate will tell you the energy efficiency rating of your home.

All new homes must have a BER certificate.

You also need to have a BER certificate if you are:

  * Selling your home 
  * Renting your property 

The owner of the home is responsible for getting the BER.

If you are selling or renting your property all advertisements for the
property must show the property's BER. The SEAI has [ more information about
these legal requirements ](https://www.seai.ie/home-energy/building-energy-
