###  **How is your BER calculated?**

A BER assesses the amount of energy your home uses for things such as:

  * Heating the hot water 
  * Heating the rooms 
  * Ventilation 
  * Lighting 

It does not include the electricity used for running appliances such as
cookers, fridges or washing machines.

The BER calculation is based on the building and does not consider the number
of people living in the home. This makes it easier for potential buyers or
renters to compare homes.
