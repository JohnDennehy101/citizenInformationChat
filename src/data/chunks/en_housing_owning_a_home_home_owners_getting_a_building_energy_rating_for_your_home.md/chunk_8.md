](https://ndber.seai.ie/pass/ber/search.aspx) . You need one of the following
to check the register:

  * The Meter Point Reference Number (MPRN) of the home. You can find this on the top of your electricity bill. 
  * An existing BER number. You can find this on the BER certificate and advisory report. 

If the property has a BER, the register will show the property's:

  * BER certificate 
  * BER advisory report 
  * BER expiry date
