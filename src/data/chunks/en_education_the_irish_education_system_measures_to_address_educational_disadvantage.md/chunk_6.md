###  **School Completion Programme**

The [ School Completion Programme ](https://www.tusla.ie/services/educational-
welfare-services/scp/) is aimed at children in primary and post-primary school
who are at risk of leaving school early, or who are out of school and havenâ€™t
transferred to another learning site (for example, [ Youthreach
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/education/further-education-and-
training/youthreach/) ).

  * Achieve a qualification at an equivalent level to the Leaving Certificate, or 
  * Achieve a suitable level of education that lets them continue into further education, training or employment 

The programme is funded [ by Tusla Education Support Services (TESS)
