##  What is the Public Sector Equality and Human Rights Duty?

All public bodies in Ireland have a legal obligation to promote equality,
prevent discrimination and protect the human rights of:

  * Their employees 
  * Their customers 
  * Their service users 
  * Anyone affected by their service 

The Public Sector Equality and Human Rights Duty applies to the whole
organisation. It is an ongoing responsibility that should be part of the
public bodyâ€™s strategic plan.

To fulfill their legal obligations, public bodies must:

  1. Assess the human rights and equality issues it believes are relevant to its functions 
  2. Address these issues, and describe how it plans to address these issues in its strategic plan 
  3. Report on developments and progress
