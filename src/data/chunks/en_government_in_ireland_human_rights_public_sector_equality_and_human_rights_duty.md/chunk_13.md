###  Charter of Fundamental Rights

The [ Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union ](/en/government-in-
ireland/european-government/eu-law/charter-of-fundamental-rights/) brings
together the most important personal freedoms and rights enjoyed by citizens
of the EU into one legally binding document. The Charter was declared in 2000,
and came into force in December 2009 along with the Treaty of Lisbon.

The Charter has the same legal power as an EU Treaty. This means that it is
superior to Irish domestic law. However, it only applies when Irish bodies
(particularly the Irish Government) are implementing European Union law.
