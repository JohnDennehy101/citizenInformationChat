.

If it believes that a public body is failing to perform its functions in line
with the Public Sector Equality and Human Rights Duty, it can either:

  * Invite the public body to carry out a review or 
  * Prepare and implement an action plan for that public body to comply with its legal obligations 

It can take either or both of the above steps.
