###  Assess

The Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission (IHREC) recommends that public
bodies should consider the following when they are carrying out the
assessment:

  * What equality and human rights legislation is most relevant to the functions and purpose of your organisation? 
  * How does your organisation measure its impact? 
  * What does your organisation know about its service users, with reference to the 9 protected grounds in equality law? 
  * What initiatives do you already have in place to support human rights and equality? 
  * What human rights and equality issues need to be prioritised for action?
