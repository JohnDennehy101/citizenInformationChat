##  The law and what bodies it applies to

The Duty is set out in section 42 of the Irish Human Rights and Equality
Commission Act 2014. It says that a public body must, in the performance of
its functions, have regard to the need to:

  * Eliminate discrimination 
  * Promote equality of opportunity and treatment of its staff and the persons to whom it provides services 
  * Protect the human rights of its members 

The Duty applies across all functions of the public body. For example, it
applies to the hiring of staff, procurement of services, corporate services,
awarding grants and providing services.
