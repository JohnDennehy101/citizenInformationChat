##  How the Children Court works

The purpose of the Children Court is to separate court cases involving
children from those which involve adults.

In Dublin, a separate Children Court venue in Smithfield hears youth justice
cases.

Outside of Dublin, Children Court cases are often held in the [ District Court
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/justice/courts-system/district-court/)
on different days or at different times to when adult cases are heard.

Judges who sit in the Children Court may be asked to do special training by
the President of the District Court. The Children Court operates to ensure
that the best interests of the child are taken into account.
