###  **A parent’s role in the Children Court**

A child's parents or guardian must attend the Children Court when their child
is in the Children Court unless excused.

If a parent or guardian does not attend, the judge can issue a [ bench warrant
](/en/justice/legal-terms-explained/) for them. This means the Gardaí can
arrest the child’s parents or guardian to ensure they are brought before the
judge.
