##  If a child pleads guilty to a serious offence

If a serious offence would normally be dealt with by a higher court, but a
child pleads guilty in the Children Court before the judge has sent the case
to the higher court, then the judge can only send the child to the higher
court for sentencing.

However, before this can happen the child must sign a plea of guilty, and the
court must be satisfied that the child understands the seriousness of the
offence and the allegations against them. The [ Director of Public
Prosecutions ](http://www.dppireland.ie/) must also consent to the childâ€™s
guilty plea.
