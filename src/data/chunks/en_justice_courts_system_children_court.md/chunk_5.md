###  **Children aged under 14 years**

If a child under the age of 14 is charged with a criminal offence, the [
Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) ](/en/justice/law-enforcement/director-
of-public-prosecutions/) must give their consent for the child to be tried.

A judge can dismiss a case against a child under the age of 14, if they have
considered the childâ€™s age and level of maturity and are satisfied that the
child did not fully understand what was involved when carrying out the
offence.
