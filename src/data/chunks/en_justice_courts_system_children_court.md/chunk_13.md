Under the [ Irish Constitution ](/en/government-in-ireland/irish-
constitution-1/constitution-introduction/) a child has a right to be tried
before a jury for non-minor offences. The judge asks the child if they want to
have their case heard:

  * In the Children Court (if the judge is willing to hear the non-minor offence in the Children Court), or 
  * Before a [ judge ](/en/justice/courtroom/judge/) and [ jury ](/en/justice/courtroom/jury/) in the higher courts 

The child can ask a parent or guardian to help with this decision.
