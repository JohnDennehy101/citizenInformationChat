##  What types of cases are heard in the Children Court?

The Children Court has the power to deal with most criminal offences committed
by children. Hearings for all minor offences are held in the Children Court,
as are most serious, indictable offences. Indictable offences are crimes so
serious that the charges must normally be heard before a jury in the higher
courts.
