##  Introduction

If you owe money and you are not able to keep up with the repayments, the debt
can become a problem. If you are in this situation you may find yourself:

  * Missing payments and getting letters from creditors 
  * Borrowing money to pay bills and catch up with arrears 
  * Making promises to pay unreasonable amounts 
  * Facing legal action 

It is important to take action to deal with your debts and stop the situation
getting worse. For example, if you donâ€™t start getting your debts under
control, your creditors could go to court and eventually [ repossess your home

happen even if you have no mortgage on your home or your mortgage payments are
up to date.
