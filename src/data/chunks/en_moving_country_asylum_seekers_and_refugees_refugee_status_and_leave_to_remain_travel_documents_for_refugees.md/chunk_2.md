##  Introduction

A travel document allows people living in Ireland who cannot get a passport to
travel outside Ireland. People who have been declared a refugee are entitled
to a 1951 Convention Travel Document.

You may also be able to get a travel document if you have subsidiary
protection status, and you cannot get a national passport from your country of
nationality.

You should note that travel documents take 26 weeks or more to process.

You may also need a visa to enter other countries. You should check always
with the embassy of the country where you to plan to travel before you go
there.
