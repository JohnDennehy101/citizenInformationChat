##  How often must tenancies be registered?

**Landlords are responsible for registering tenancies** . New tenancies must
be registered by the landlord within a month of the start of the tenancy.
After that, landlords must re-register the tenancy every year that the same
tenancy continues. This must be done within a month of the date of when the
tenancy first began.

For example, if a new tenancy begins on 4 July 2024, the landlord must
register the tenancy by 3 August 2024 (within one month of the tenancy start
date). If the tenancy continues for the next 12 months, the landlord must
register the tenancy again by 3 August 2025, and then every year by 3 August
while the tenancy continues.

Annual registration has applied since 4 April 2022. The RTB will remind
landlords when their tenancy is due for annual registration, if they have up-
to-date contact information for the landlord.
