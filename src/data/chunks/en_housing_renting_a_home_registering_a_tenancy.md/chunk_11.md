###  Late fees

If you are late registering a tenancy, late fees apply for each month that the
registration is late.

**Late fees resumed since 1 March 2024**

Late fees were paused for a period because there were issues registering
tenancies using the new annual registration system. The charging of late fees
restarted on 1 March 2024.

Late fees will not be applied for the period when annual registration late
fees were initially introduced and then paused.
