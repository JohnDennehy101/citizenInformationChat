###  Registration fees for approved housing bodies (AHBs)

The standard fee for registering an AHB tenancy is €20 a year. This rate
applies if the tenancy is registered within a month of the start of the
tenancy. There is a late fee of €5 per month for each month that the
registration is late.

If you are registering up to 10 AHB tenancies in the same building you can pay
a combined fee of €85, if you register them on time.
