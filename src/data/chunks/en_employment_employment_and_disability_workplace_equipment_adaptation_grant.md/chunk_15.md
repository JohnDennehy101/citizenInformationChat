###  **Sourcing the adaptations**

Employers are responsible for sourcing the necessary adaptations themselves.
Once the application is fully approved, the employer can procure and purchase
the approved adaptation and then request reimbursement from the Department of
Social Protection.

There is no pre-approved list of providers.
