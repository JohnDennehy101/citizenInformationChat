##  What is the Workplace Adaptation Grant?

necessary changes to their workplace for an employee or future employee with a
disability.

The grant of up to €25,000 covers modifications to equipment, technology and
the business or remote working premises (note that adaptations to the
employees home should be covered under the [ Housing Adaptation Grant
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/housing/housing-grants-and-
schemes/housing-supports-for-older-people-and-people-with-
disabilities/housing-adaptation-grant-for-people-with-disability/) , even if
it is the employee’s primary workplace).
