##  Pregnancy and Illness Benefit

If you are pregnant and claiming Illness Benefit, you will continue to be paid
Illness Benefit if you have an illness which meets the criteria for the
payment. You cannot use pregnancy itself as a medical reason to claim Illness
Benefit. However, medical complications arising from your pregnancy can
satisfy the medical criteria for Illness Benefit.

You must continue to send in medical certificates to qualify for Illness
Benefit.

When your baby is born you may qualify for an increase in your Illness Benefit
for a child dependant. You should contact the Illness Benefit section to find
out if you qualify.

**Pregnant and on sick leave from work**

If you are on sick leave from work and getting Illness Benefit immediately
before you are due to start your maternity leave, you will transfer from
Illness Benefit to Maternity Benefit when your maternity leave starts, if you
satisfy the social insurance contributions.

The social insurance contributions for Maternity Benefit and Illness Benefit
are not the same. Therefore, if you are in employment but on sick leave and
not getting Illness Benefit, you may still qualify for Maternity Benefit if
you satisfy social insurance contributions.
