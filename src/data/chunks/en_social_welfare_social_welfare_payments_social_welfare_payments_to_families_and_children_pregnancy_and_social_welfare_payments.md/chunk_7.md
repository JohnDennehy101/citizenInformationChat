##  Pregnancy and employment schemes

If you are taking part in an employment scheme you have the full range of
statutory employment rights including [ maternity leave
](/en/employment/employment-rights-and-conditions/leave-and-
holidays/maternity-leave/) .

If you become pregnant while on [ an employment scheme
](/en/employment/unemployment-and-redundancy/employment-support-
schemes/schemes-to-support-employment/) (Community Employment, Rural Social
Scheme, Tús and Gateway schemes) you are entitled to take 26 weeks’ maternity
leave including an additional 16 weeks of optional unpaid leave. If possible,
you will be supported to complete your 52 weeks of paid work on the same or
another project when you finish your maternity leave.

You should discuss with your sponsor the payment you qualify for while you are
on maternity leave. You may qualify for Maternity Benefit if you have enough
PRSI contributions. Otherwise, if your spouse or partner is getting a social
welfare payment, you may get a qualified adult increase on their payment.
