##  Getting married for immigrationpurposes

If a couple is getting married solely for an immigration advantage, this is
known as a ‘marriage of convenience’. A ‘marriage of convenience’ is a
marriage where at least one of you:

  * is a foreign national at the time of entry into the marriage, and 
  * enters into the marriage only for the purpose of securing an immigration advantage for one or both of the parties to the marriage 

A marriage Registrar has the right to investigate and decide whether an
intended marriage would be a marriage of convenience for immigration purposes.
If, following investigation, the Superintendent Registrar decides that a
proposed marriage is a marriage of convenience, then they will not issue a
Marriage Registration Form, which is necessary to get married. This means the
marriage may not proceed. The decision may be appealed to the Circuit Court.

If you meet the requirements outlined above, you should then consider how you
wish to marry. There are different types of [ legally-binding marriage
ceremonies in Ireland ](/en/birth-family-relationships/getting-
married/different-legal-ways-of-getting-married/) , including religious,
secular and [ civil marriage ceremonies ](/en/birth-family-
relationships/getting-married/civil-marriage-ceremony/) . If you are marrying
through a [ religious or secular ceremony ](/en/birth-family-
relationships/getting-married/religious-and-secular-marriage-ceremonies/) ,
you should discuss their requirements with the celebrant of your marriage.
