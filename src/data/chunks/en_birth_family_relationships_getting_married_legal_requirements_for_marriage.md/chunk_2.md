##  Introduction

Marriage is a legally binding contract that affects you and your partner (and,
to a certain extent, your children) for all of your lives. There are certain
rules and regulations about who you can and cannot marry, and in what
circumstances.

This page explains the legal requirements for getting married in Ireland. It
also sets out the different impediments (obstacles) to marriage in Ireland,
such as being a blood relative or marrying for immigration reasons.
