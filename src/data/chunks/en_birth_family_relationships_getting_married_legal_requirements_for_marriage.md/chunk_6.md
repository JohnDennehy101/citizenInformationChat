##  If you are related by blood ormarriage

Certain people related by blood or marriage cannot get married. A couple who
fall within these 'prohibited degrees of relationship' cannot marry. These
prohibitions are based on:

  * _Consanguinity_ – a blood relationship including half blood (half blood means having one parent in common, for example, a half-brother) 
  * _Affinity_ – relationship by marriage 

The prohibited degrees apply to a wide range of family relationships,
including marital and non-marital children.

You can marry your deceased spouse's sister or brother. This also applies if
your marriage ends due to a divorce rather than a death.

There is no legal restriction on the marriage of first cousins.
