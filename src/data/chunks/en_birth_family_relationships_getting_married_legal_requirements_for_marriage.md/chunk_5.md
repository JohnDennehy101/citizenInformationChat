###  If your civil partnership was dissolved abroad

If you had a legal dissolution of your civil partnership or equivalent legal
relationship granted outside Ireland, it will be recognised under Irish law if
the Minister of Justice made an order recognising an equivalent legal
relationship in the country where the dissolution was granted.
