##  Traveller education

Traveller children have the same rights to education as settled children. They
are also subject to the same rules on [ school attendance
](/en/education/primary-and-post-primary-education/attendance-and-discipline-
in-schools/school-attendance/) .

A Traveller child can access additional learning [ supports in primary school
](/en/education/special-education-needs/special-needs-education-primary-
schools/) and [ supports in post-primary school ](/en/education/special-
education-needs/post-primary-education-for-students-with-special-needs/) if
there is an identified educational need.

Travellers were formally recognised as a distinct ethnic group within the
Irish State in March 2017. The [ National Traveller and Roma Inclusion
Strategy 2017-2021(pdf)
](https://assets.gov.ie/43310/d7d54fbff0f4418982856e7dddaf78c1.pdf) is a
cross-Departmental initiative to improve the lives of the Traveller and Roma
communities in Ireland. The Department of Education, Tusla and Traveller
Representative Groups collaborate on education related measures proposed in
the strategy, to improve Traveller engagement with education.
