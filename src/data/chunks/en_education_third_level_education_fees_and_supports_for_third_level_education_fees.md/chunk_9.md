###  EU fees

If you do not qualify for free fees, you may still be eligible for _EU fee
rates_ . EU fee rates are set by each individual third-level educational
institution. You should contact the one you are interested in to find out
about the EU fee rate and whether you qualify.

Some examples of when people might qualify for an EU fee rate include:

  * You originally qualified for free fees and are now **repeating a year** that you failed. 
  * You do not fulfil any of the nationality and immigration status criteria listed above but have been **tax resident** for a number of years in an EEA member state or Switzerland (however, as the third-level institutions are autonomous bodies, this is at the discretion of the institution concerned) 

An Irish, EU, EEA or Swiss student who has spent at least 5 years in primary
school or second-level school in Ireland can avail of EU fee rates.

If you do not qualify for EU fees, you can be charged non-EU fees. Each third-
level educational institution sets its own fee rates. You should contact the
ones you are interested in to find out more about their fees (see 'Where to
apply' below).
