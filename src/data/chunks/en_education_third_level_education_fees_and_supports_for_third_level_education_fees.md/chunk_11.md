###  Student grants

Student grants provide financial support to eligible students. Student grants
are divided into:

  * Maintenance grants 
  * Fee grants 

A maintenance grant is a contribution towards your living costs.

A fee grant can cover:

  * All or part of your tuition fees (if you do not qualify for the Free Fees Scheme) 
  * All or part of the student contribution 
  * Costs of essential field trips 

If you have qualified for a maintenance grant, you will generally qualify for
a fee grant.

If you do not qualify for a maintenance grant, but your familyâ€™s reckonable
income is below certain limits, you may qualify for a partial fee grant. This
means that you will either be exempt from 50% of the student contribution, or
exempt from 50% of any tuition fees and all of the student contribution.
