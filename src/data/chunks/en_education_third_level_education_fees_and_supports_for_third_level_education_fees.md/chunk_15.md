##  How do I apply for free fees?

There is no separate application for the Free Fees Initiative. Your
eligibility will be assessed based on the information you give when applying
for a college place (see ‘Free fees’ above).

For information about fees, contact your chosen [ third-level educational
institution ](http://hea.ie/higher-education-institutions/?v=l) .
