##  Introduction

There is a lot of EU legislation about environmental issues. Some of the main
areas include:

  * [ Nature and biodiversity ](/en/environment/pets-and-wildlife/protection-of-nature-and-biodiversity/)
  * Integrated pollution control 
  * [ Waste management ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/environment/waste-and-recycling/)
  * [ Air pollution ](/en/environment/pollution/air-pollution/)
  * [ Water pollution ](/en/housing/water-and-coasts/water-quality/)
  * [ Noise pollution ](/en/environment/pollution/noise-regulations/)
  * [ Environmental impact assessment ](/en/environment/climate-change/environmental-impact-assessment/)
  * Genetically modified organisms 

A lot of [ EU legislation to protect the environment ](http://eur-
lex.europa.eu/summary/chapter/environment.html?root_default=SUM_1_CODED=20) is
quite technical, and sets out detailed technical and scientific standards
which EU member states, like Ireland, must follow.

This type of legislation often states that EU member states must provide
information to the European Commission outlining:

  * How they are implementing the rules 
  * How effective the rules have been 

As well as this, there are several international conventions on environmental
protection. Generally, these are approved by the EU and then implemented
through EU legislation.
