##  How do I access environmental information?

You have the right to get certain environmental information from a public
authority.

To get access to environmental information, you can use:

  * [ Freedom of Information (FOI) ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/government-in-ireland/how-government-works/standards-and-accountability/freedom-of-information/) legislation 
  * The [ European Communities (Access to Information on the Environment) Regulations 2007 to 2018 (AIE Regulations) ](https://www.gov.ie/en/organisation-information/1e52cb-access-to-information-on-the-environment-aie/#aie-legislation)

These Regulations give effect in Ireland to the [ AIE Directive ](http://eur-
lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2003:041:0026:0032:EN:PDF) .
This directive was adopted to support the Access to Information pillar of the
[ Aarhus Convention
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/environment/environment-and-the-
law/aarhus-convention/) .

As well as giving you the right to access environmental information, the AIE
Regulations also require public authorities to be proactive about providing
environmental information to the public.

Public authorities must inform the public of their rights and provide
information and guidance on exercising those rights. They must also make
reasonable efforts to maintain environmental information and have it in a form
that is accessible and can be reproduced.

You can read the [ guidance notes (pdf)
](https://assets.gov.ie/76998/4d6c5e83-b377-493e-92c6-c76de9d2e0d8.pdf) on the
implementation of the AIE Regulations public authorities must have regard to.
