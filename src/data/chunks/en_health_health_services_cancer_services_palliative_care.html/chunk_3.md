##  Types of palliative care

There are different types of palliative care available, depending on your
needs.

You may be given palliative care in:

  * Your own home, by home-care nurses working with your family doctor and a specialist palliative care team if needed 
  * A hospice, which is a specialist palliative care unit 
  * A general hospital by a specialist palliative care team 
  * A community hospital or nursing home, by home-care nurses working with your family doctor and specialist palliative care teams if needed 

Access to palliative care is decided by the HSE on the basis of need. The
availability of palliative care varies across the different counties in
Ireland.

You can find palliative care services available in each county on the [ Irish
Association for Palliative Care services directory
](http://www.iapc.ie/directory/) .
