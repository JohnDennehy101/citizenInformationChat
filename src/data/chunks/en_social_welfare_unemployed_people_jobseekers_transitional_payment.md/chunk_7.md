####  Income from work

If you are working, the first €165 of your gross weekly earnings is
disregarded (or not taken into account). Half (50%) of the balance is assessed
as means.

If you are self-employed, your net profit (your gross income minus expenses)
is assessed in full. The €165 disregard does not apply, and 100% of your
income is assessed as means.

**Work and Jobseeker's Transitional Payment example** _Example_ Niamh is
working and earns €350 per week and has 1 child.  The maximum JST payment
possible is €232 personal rate plus an Increase for a Qualified Child under 12
years of age of €46 = €278  Earnings of €350 – €165 disregard = €185  50% of
€185 = €92.50 = Niamh’s assessable earnings  JST maximum payment of €278 -
assessable earnings of €92.50 = €185.50  Niamh will be paid JST of €185.50

work at least 38 hours per fortnight.
