##  How much domestic violence leave is available?

You have a right to 5 days of domestic violence leave in any consecutive 12
months. This is the _statutory entitlement_ (that means the legal minimum).
Your employer can give you more than the statutory entitlement and they may
give you additional paid or unpaid special leave if needed.

If you work part-time, you are entitled to domestic violence leave on a _pro-
rata basis_ . This means, for example, if you work 50% of a normal working
week, you are entitled to 2.5 daysâ€™ leave.

The leave does not need to be taken all at once. It can be taken as single or
multiple days. An absence for part of a day is counted as one day.
