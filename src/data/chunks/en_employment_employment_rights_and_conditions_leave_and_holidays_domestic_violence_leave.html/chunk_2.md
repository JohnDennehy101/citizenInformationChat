##  What is domestic violence leave?

If you are experiencing domestic violence and abuse, you may need to take time
off work for urgent and essential matters relating to your situation.

This could be for medical visits, legal proceedings, counselling, looking for
alternative accommodation or accessing domestic violence services. It might
not be possible to do these things outside your work hours or you may need to
keep them hidden from your abuser.

From 27 November 2023, you have a legal right to **5 days of paid domestic
violence leave** if you need to take time off work because of the abuse.

You do not need to be working in your job for a certain amount of time to
qualify.

You do not have to give your employer notice to take the leave in emergency
circumstances. However, you should give notice if you are able to.

The domestic violence can be ongoing or have occurred in the past.

The entitlement to domestic violence leave comes from the [ Work Life Balance
and Miscellaneous Provisions Act 2023.
