##  Confidentiality

Your employer should treat any information you disclose about domestic
violence with the utmost sensitivity and confidentiality.

They should only share the information with those who need it for safety plans
or administering domestic violence leave. Ideally, your employer should get
your written permission before sharing any information.

Sharing information does not always mean breaking confidentiality. Your
employer can find ways to share details without revealing your identity or the
fact that you disclosed domestic violence.
