###  Pay and File system

Under self-assessment there is a common date for the payment of tax and filing
of tax returns. This is 31 October each year. This system, which is known as [
Pay and File ](http://www.revenue.ie/en/business/self-assessment.html) allows
you (or an agent) to file your return and pay the balance of tax outstanding
for the previous year at the same time. Under this system you must:

  * Pay preliminary tax for the current tax year on or before 31 October each year. The deadline for people who pay and file online using the Revenue Online Service (ROS) is usually slightly later. In 2024, the extended deadline is 14 November 2024. 
  * Make your tax return after the end of the tax year but not later than the following 31 October. 
  * Pay any balance of tax due for the previous tax year on or before 31 October. 

For example, by 31 October 2024 you must:

  * Pay your preliminary tax for 2024 
  * File your 2023 self-assessment tax return 
  * Pay any income tax balance for 2023
