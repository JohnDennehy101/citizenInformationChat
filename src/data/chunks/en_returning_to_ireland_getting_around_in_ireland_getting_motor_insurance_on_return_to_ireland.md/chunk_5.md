##  Can I use my previous no claims bonus when I return to Ireland?

A no claims bonus (also known as no claims discount) is a percentage discount
on car insurance given to drivers who do not have any claims on their record.
You can build up a no claims bonus over the years and it will lower the cost
of your car insurance.
