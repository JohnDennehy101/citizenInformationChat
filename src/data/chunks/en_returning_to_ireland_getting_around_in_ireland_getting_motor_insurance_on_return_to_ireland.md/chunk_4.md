###  **Your insurance premium**

An insurance premium is the monthly or annual payment you make to an insurance
company to keep your policy active.

The cost of your premium is determined by the level of risk an insurer
considers you to pose as a driver. In some cases, an insurer may impose an
extra charge to a standard premium to reflect any additional risk assumed.
This is referred to as a ‘loading.’
