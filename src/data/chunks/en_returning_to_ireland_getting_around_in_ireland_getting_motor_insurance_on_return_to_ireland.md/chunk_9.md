##  What can I do if I am refused motor insurance?

If you cannot get motor insurance from any insurer in Ireland, you can use the
[ Declined Cases Agreement ](https://www.insuranceireland.eu/consumer-
information/general-non-life-insurance/declined-cases-agreement) . Under the
Agreement, if you are refused quotations from at least 3 insurers, you can
email the Declined Cases Committee at declined@insuranceireland.eu, and they
will get an insurance quote for you.

You must provide the 3 refusals in writing (letter or email) to the Declined
Cases Committee. An insurance provider must give you a reason for a refusal if
you ask for one.

If you would like to make a formal complaint against a motor insurance
provider that operates in Ireland, you can read about how to do so from the [
Competition and Consumer Protection Commission
](https://www.ccpc.ie/consumers/how-to-complain/complaints-about-financial-
services-providers/) . Insurance Ireland has more information on [ what to do
if you are refused motor insurance cover
