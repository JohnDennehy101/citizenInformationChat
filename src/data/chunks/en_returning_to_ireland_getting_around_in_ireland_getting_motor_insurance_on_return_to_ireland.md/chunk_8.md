##  Do insurers take my driving history abroad into account?

Each motor insurer will consider several factors when giving you a car
insurance quote, including your claims history and where you were driving.

Insurers will take overseas driving experience into account as long as you can
provide proof of claims-free driving experience abroad. In general, motor
insurers will take your no claims history into account from the EEA, the UK,
Switzerland, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, Canada, South Africa, and the USA.
Some insurers may accept your no claims history from other countries.

When buying car insurance in Ireland, you may be asked for proof of your
driving history and no claims record. Make sure you have the following
documents:

  * A no claims discount statement 
  * An additional letter or other official document from your last insurer stating the circumstances of your insurance cover (dates and type of cover) and your no claims driving history 
  * Records of your previous driving experience in Ireland if you have any 

Before you return to Ireland, make sure your current insurer can give you
these documents and can arrange translation if necessary.
