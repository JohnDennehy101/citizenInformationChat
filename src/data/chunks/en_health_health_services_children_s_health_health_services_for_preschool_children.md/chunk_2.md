##  Introduction

The [ Health Service Executive ](/en/health/health-system/health-service-
executive/) (HSE) provides health services for pre-school children. Every
child up to the age of 5 years old will have free health and development
checks. This is to make sure they are healthy and developing normally.

The visits and health checks are an opportunity for you to talk about how you
are getting on. You can ask any questions or talk about any concerns you have
about yourself or your baby.

Checks might take place at home, at a GP surgery or at your [ local health
centre ](https://www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/2/healthcentres/) .
