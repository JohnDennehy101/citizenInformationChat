##  What is Jobseeker's Allowance?

Jobseeker's Allowance is a payment to people who are unemployed. If you are
unemployed, you can apply for Jobseeker’s Allowance (JA) or [ Jobseeker's
Benefit (JB) ](/en/social-welfare/unemployed-people/jobseekers-benefit/) .

You can apply for JA, if you have been on JB and your payment has ended. You
can also apply for JA, if you are only entitled to a reduced rate of JB and
would be better off on JA (this is known as [ Optional JA
](jobseekers_benefit.en.html#part7) .)

Jobseeker’s Allowance is a means-tested payment, so your income must be below
a certain amount to get JA.

If you are parenting alone, you can apply for the [ Jobseeker’s Transitional
payment (JST) ](/en/social-welfare/unemployed-people/jobseekers-transitional-
payment/) . It provides support to lone parents who have young children aged
between 7 and 13.
