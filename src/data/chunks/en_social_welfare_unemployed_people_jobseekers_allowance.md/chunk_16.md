##  How to apply for Jobseeker's Allowance

You should apply for Jobseeker's Allowance the first day you become
unemployed. It is important to apply on the first day you become unemployed
because you will not get paid for the first 3 days of your claim.

If you [ make a late claim ](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-
system/claiming-a-social-welfare-payment/making-a-late-claim/) , it may be
backdated if you provide good evidence for the delay.

More information is available in our document about [ signing on for the first
time ](/en/social-welfare/unemployed-people/signing-on/) .

If you think you have been wrongly refused Jobseeker's Allowance you can [
appeal the decision to the Social Welfare Appeals Office ](/en/social-
welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/social-welfare-appeals/) .
