####  **Adult dependants**

You may get an Increase for a Qualified Adult (IQA) for an _adult dependant_
(this is usually your spouse or partner).

You can claim an increase for your partner if they started their CE scheme
before 1 January 2023 or they they are taking part [ TÃºs
](/en/employment/unemployment-and-redundancy/employment-support-schemes/tus/)
. The means test will assess their income from the scheme in the same way as
income from a job where they pay PRSI.

If your partner started a CE scheme in 2023, you cannot claim an increase in
your payment for them. It will include full rate increases for your child
dependants. Half of your joint income will be assessed in the means test.

If your spouse, civil partner or cohabitant is getting a social welfare
payment in his or her own right (with some exceptions) or is on a Further
Education and Training (FET) course or VTOS course and getting an allowance
you will not get an IQA, but you will get a half-rate increase for any
qualified children.

If you live with a person aged 16 or over who is caring for your child
dependant, you may be able to get an IQA for them. To apply for this IQA, you
must be single, widowed, divorced, separated, a former civil partner or not
living with your civil partner.
