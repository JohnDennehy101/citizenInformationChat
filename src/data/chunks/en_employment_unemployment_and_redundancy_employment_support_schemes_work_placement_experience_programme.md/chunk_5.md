###  **Other schemes that count towards the qualifying period**

The qualifying period can also include time spent on schemes such as the
following:

  * [ Community Employment Scheme (CE) ](/en/employment/unemployment-and-redundancy/employment-support-schemes/community-employment-scheme/)
  * [ TÃºs ](/en/employment/unemployment-and-redundancy/employment-support-schemes/tus/)

  * [ Solas Training Programmes ](https://www.solas.ie/)

You must transfer to a Jobseekers payment before you can take up the
placement.

If you spent time in prison, this may count towards the 156-day qualifying
period, as long as you are entitled to a qualifying social welfare payment.
