###  **Training and development**

When you start, you agree on a learning and development plan with the host
organisation. This will detail the skills and experience that you will have
the opportunity to learn. You are expected to complete 60 hours of training
that is provided by your organisation or on part-time education and training
courses. 20 of the 60 hours should be accredited or sector specific training.

Your host organisation will nominate someone to support and mentor you. At the
end of your placement, you will be given a reference stating your work
experience and the skills and learning you have gained.

You can get a [ Training Support Grant
](http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/Training-Support-Grant.aspx) of up to â‚¬1,000
if needed. The grant is available regardless of whether you availed of the
grant before.
