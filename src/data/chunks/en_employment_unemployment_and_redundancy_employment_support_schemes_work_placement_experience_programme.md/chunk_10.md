##  How does WPEP work?

The DSP will provide a case officer, who will contact you and your host
organisation throughout your placement. The placement will be monitored with
monthly reporting to make sure that it continues to meet the [ scheme
guidelines ](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/98f23-operational-guidelines-
work-placement-experience-programme/) .
