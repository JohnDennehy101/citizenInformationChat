###  **Situations where no qualifying period is needed**

No qualifying period is needed if you are getting a qualifying DSP payment and
your Employment Personal Advisor recognises that you face challenges entering
the job market. Challenges might include:

  * Having a disability or dealing with mental health issues 
  * Belonging to the Travelling or Roma community 
  * Being a refugee or migrant 
  * Losing your job later in your career as an older person 
  * Taking time out of work for caring responsibilities (not receiving Carerâ€™s Allowance and must be on an eligible payment) 
  * Having spent time in prison
