####  Getting a refund

  * You can get a refund of the full cost of the ticket for the parts of your journey you have not made. You can also get a refund for the parts of the journey you have already made (if you are not going to continue to your destination). You can also get a free ticket to take you back to the first point of your departure, as soon as possible.
