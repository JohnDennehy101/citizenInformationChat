###  Your right to access and a ticket

You have the right to get a ticket, book a seat and use transport services in
the same way as other passengers. You should not be discriminated against or
charged extra.

You can only be refused travel if the service cannot be provided safely. For
example, due to the layout of the train, the boarding points, or the type of
seats or luggage racks.

In most cases, if the train company refuses you a ticket or a reservation, or
requires you to bring a helper, they must immediately tell you why. If you ask
for written confirmation, they must send it to you within 5 working days.
