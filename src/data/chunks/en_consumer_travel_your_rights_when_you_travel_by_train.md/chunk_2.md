##  What are my rights when travelling by rail?

You have passenger rights when you travel on most trains in the EU.

These cover delays, cancellations, lost luggage and injury.

_Travel operators_ must:

  * Give you information about your rights and what help you are entitled to 
  * Treat you and other passengers fairly and equally 
  * Resolve issues caused by delays or cancellations 

Travel operators include transport companies (which run trains) and companies
that operate terminals such as train stations.
