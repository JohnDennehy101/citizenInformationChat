###  Family home (married couples)

A _family home_ primarily means a home in which a married couple ordinarily
lives. Some family homes are held in the sole name of just one spouse.
However, many family homes are held in the names of both spouses as a [ joint
tenancy ](/en/birth-family-relationships/cohabiting-couples/property-rights-
cohabiting-couples/) as this is often a condition of the mortgage used to buy
the house.
