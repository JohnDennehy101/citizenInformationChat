##  Protection of the family or shared home

There are laws to prevent one spouse or civil partner from selling,
mortgaging, leasing or transferring the family or shared home without the
agreement of the other spouse or civil partner. This is particularly important
when the home is held in the name of only one spouse or civil partner.

However, the courts can remove the need for the other person's agreement if it
thinks that the withholding of consent is unreasonable. You can also apply to
the courts for an order to restrain the other spouse or civil partner from
doing anything that might reduce your or their interest in the shared home, or
make it unsuitable to live in.

You can inform the [ Property Registration Authority ](http://www.prai.ie/)
that you are the spouse or civil partner of a property owner. A notice to that
effect will then be registered. There is no charge for such a registration.
There is no requirement to do this and if you donâ€™t, it does not affect your
rights as a spouse or civil partner.

There is no stamp duty or registry fees payable on the transfer of a family
home or shared home from the name of one person in marriage or civil
partnership to a joint tenancy.
