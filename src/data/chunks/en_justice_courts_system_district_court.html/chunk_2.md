##  Introduction

The District Court is the lowest court in the Irish court system. It is
regulated by the President of the District Court and up to 71 District Court
judges.

The District Court is organised on a regional basis. There are 23 District
Court Districts, as well as the Dublin Metropolitan District. Each District is
divided into [ District Court areas ](https://www.courts.ie/content/map-
district-court-areas) and has one or more judges permanently assigned to it.

The District Court is a court of local and limited jurisdiction. This means it
can only make orders or decisions on certain types of civil and criminal
cases.
