##  Barristers

Barristers, also known as Counsel, generally operate from the Law Library.
They cannot advertise or solicit clients and do not generally have direct
access to the public. They take their instructions from solicitors.

They provide legal advice of a specialist nature and generally represent the
client in court.

There is a distinction between Junior and Senior Counsel. Many junior
barristers consider becoming a Senior Counsel after about 15 years of
practice. Senior Counsel are barristers with greater experience or expertise.
They tend to do less drafting of court documents and spend more time giving
advice and conducting cases in the higher courts.
