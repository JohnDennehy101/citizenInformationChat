##  Information a solicitor needs

You need to be well-prepared before you start to instruct a solicitor to make
sure you get the best outcome. For example, if you have been involved in an
accident that caused personal injury, the solicitor will need to know:

  * All the facts surrounding the accident 
  * All of the injuries you suffered as a result of the accident 
  * All of the expenses which the accident caused you to incur 

**Factual information**

If your accident occurred in the workplace, you will need to explain:

  * What you were doing at the time of the accident 
  * Who was in charge when the accident took place 
  * Who witnessed the accident 

If your accident was a road traffic accident, you will need to describe
clearly:

  * Where you were coming from or going to 
  * What the weather conditions were like 
  * What was the sequence of events leading up to the accident 
  * Whether you were wearing a seat-belt at the time of the accident 
  * What markings and signs were on the road 
  * Who was the investigating Garda 
  * What were the names and addresses of any witnesses 

**Personal injury details**

When describing your injuries, start with your sensations and feelings at the
time of and immediately after the accident. Then explain whether, when and how
you went to hospital.

Describe all injuries that you suffered, whether they were physical,
psychological or emotional, and all the symptoms, including sleep-loss and
nightmares. List all of the doctors, hospitals, physiotherapists and
counsellors (if any) that you attended after the accident.

If you already had injuries before the accident, you must inform your
solicitor of the details. Describe all of the treatments and medications you
received as a result of the accident and outline what your doctor thinks might
be the long-term effects of your injuries.

**Expenses**

Calculate any loss of earnings because you could not go to work and keep a
record of medical expenses like medication costs and doctors' bills. You
should also include related expenses such as bus and taxi-fares if you are
unable to drive as a result of the accident.

**Other types of claim**

Other types of claims need similar attention to detail in describing what
exactly happened. In a defamation case, it will be necessary to relate how
your reputation or good name has suffered. In a land case, a detailed
description of the history of the land in question and how the dispute arose
will be necessary.
