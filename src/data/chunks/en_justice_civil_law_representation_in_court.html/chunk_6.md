##  How to contact a solicitor

People normally choose a particular solicitor because of a personal
recommendation, because the solicitor's office is in their area or because
they saw an advertisement.

It is usual to first telephone for an appointment with a solicitor. In some
family situations, it may be necessary to consider separate legal
representation for each spouse or partner.

The Law Society is the educational, representative and regulatory body of the
solicitors' profession in Ireland.
