###  **Social housing for older people**

Some local authorities provide accommodation specifically for older people.
This type of community accommodation (called ‘sheltered’ housing) may have
extra security features, such as wardens and security cameras. You may also
get on-site meals and nursing care (though it is not a nursing home).

Each local authority allocates housing in accordance with its own housing
allocation scheme, so you will need to [ contact your local authority
](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/942f74-local-authorities/) to find out if
this type of accommodation is available in the area you want to live.

The age limit for this type of accommodation can also vary from one local
authority to another.
