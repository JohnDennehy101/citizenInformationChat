###  **Help with paying rent**

Depending on your circumstances when you return to Ireland, you may qualify
for [ rent supports ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/housing/renting-a-
home/help-with-renting/) . However, you cannot apply for these supports
immediately when you arrive.

For example, to qualify for the [ Housing Assistance Payment (HAP)
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/housing/renting-a-home/help-with-
renting/housing-assistance-payment/) , you must already be on your local
authority’s social housing list (see ‘Social housing’ above). Similarly, you
must be living in rented accommodation for at least 6 months (183 days) of the
last 12 months to be eligible for [ Rent Supplement
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/social-welfare-
payments/supplementary-welfare-schemes/rent-supplement/) .
