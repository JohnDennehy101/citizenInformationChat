##  Emergency accommodation

If you will be homeless when you return to Ireland, you may be able to access
emergency accommodation. This is for people who are homeless and includes
hostels, B&Bs, hotels, and family hubs.

If you need emergency accommodation, contact [ your local authority
](https://www.housing.gov.ie/local-government/administration/local-
authorities/local-authorities) . You will be assessed by a Housing Officer who
will confirm your emergency housing needs. Your emergency accommodation may
vary depending on which local authority you go to, and whether you need
housing as an individual or a family.
