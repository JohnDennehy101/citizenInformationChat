###  PRSI

Employee PRSI did not apply to the subsidy or to top-up payments by the
employer (employees are set to PRSI class J9).

Employers PRSI did not apply to the subsidy and was reduced from 10.5% to 0.5%
on the top-up payment within the thresholds set out by Revenue (see ‘Level of
subsidy and income thresholds’ above). However, if the wage subsidy plus any
top-up payments exceeded the thresholds, the employee was longer eligible for
any subsidy and the employee returned to PRSI class A1.

[ Section 4.4.3 of Revenue’s FAQ (pdf) ](https://www.revenue.ie/en/employing-
people/documents/pmod-topics/guidance-on-operation-of-temporary-covid-wage-
subsidy-scheme.pdf) shows the impact that top-up payments had on the subsidy
and PRSI class.

Employees continued to be [ covered by social insurance ](/en/social-
welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/social-insurance-prsi/social-insurance/)
while their employer was getting a subsidy. Their PRSI entitlements was not
broken and they continued to get insurable weeks or [ credited social
insurance contributions. ](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-
