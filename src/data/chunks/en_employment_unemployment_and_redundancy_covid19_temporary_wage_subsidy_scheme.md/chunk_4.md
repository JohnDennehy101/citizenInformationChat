###  People getting social welfare and other payments

People aged over 66 who were getting a State pension were eligible for the
Temporary COVID-19 Wage Subsidy scheme and could keep their pension payment.

People getting a Working Family Payment were also eligible for the scheme,
provided all other eligibility criteria were met – see ‘Rates’ below.

If you re-hired employees who were previously laid off, the employee could
qualify for the Subsidy scheme if their DSP claim had ceased. Revenue shared
data with DSP. The employer did not have to cease the employment for an
employee to be able to receive COVID-19 Pandemic Unemployment Payment.
However, if an employee was receiving both COVID-19 Pandemic Unemployment
Payment and the wage subsidy scheme, DSP ceased their COVID-19 Pandemic
Unemployment payment.

An employee who was receiving a TWSS payment and whose work was reduced to 3
days or less per week, could apply for [ Short Time Work Support
](https://www.gov.ie/en/service/c20e1b-short-time-work-support/) which is a
form of [ Jobseeker’s Benefit ](/en/social-welfare/unemployed-
people/jobseekers-benefit/) .

The Temporary COVID-19 Wage Subsidy Scheme applied both to employers that top
up employees’ wages and those that were not in a position to do so.
