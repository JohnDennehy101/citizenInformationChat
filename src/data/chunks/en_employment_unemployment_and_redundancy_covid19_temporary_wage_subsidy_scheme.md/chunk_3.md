##  Who qualified for the Temporary COVID-19 Wage Subsidy Scheme?

**The TWSS closed on 31 August 2020 and no new applications can be accepted
from that date.**

The Scheme was available to employers from all sectors (except for the public
service and non-commercial semi-state sector) who had lost **a minimum of 25%
of turnover because of the COVID-19 pandemic** . Employers had to make a
declaration to Revenue confirming this.

The scheme was available for employers who keep staff on their payroll during
the pandemic. Employees could be:

  * Temporarily not working (laid off) or 
  * On reduced hours and/or reduced pay 

To qualify for the scheme, you must have:

  * Self-declared to Revenue that you experienced significant negative economic disruption due to COVID-19, with a minimum of 25% decline in turnover (between 14 March 2020 and 30 June 2020) 
  * Been unable to pay normal wages and normal outgoings fully 
  * Kept your employees on your payroll 

Employees must have been on your payroll on 29 February 2020, and you must
have made payroll submission on their behalf to Revenue in the period from 1
February 2020 to 31 March 2020.

Employers could not operate the scheme for employees who were making a claim
for duplicate support from the DSP (such as the [ COVID-19 Pandemic
Unemployment Payment ](/en/social-welfare/unemployed-people/covid19-pandemic-
unemployment-payment/) ). However **if your employee was already getting a
payment from the DSP** such as a carers or disability payment, you could
operate the scheme on their behalf.
