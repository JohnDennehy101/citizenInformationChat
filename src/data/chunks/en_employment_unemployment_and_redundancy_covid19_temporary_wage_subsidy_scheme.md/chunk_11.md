###  Levels of subsidy from 4 May 2020 to 31 August 2020

From 4 May 2020, the subsidy payment moved to a system based on the previous
weekly average take home pay for each employee. The previous weekly average
take home pay was based on an employee’s pay in January and February 2020.

On 4 May 2020 Revenue informed all eligible employers of the maximum personal
subsidy amount in respect of each individual employee on its payroll based on
the employee’s Average Revenue Net Weekly Pay.

**Income thresholds** |  **Level of subsidy payment**  
---|---  
Previous average take home pay **below €412** per week  |  85% of the weekly average take home pay   
Previous average take home pay **between €412 and €500** per week  |  Flat rate subsidy of €350 per week   
Previous average take home pay **between €500 and €586** per week  |  70% of the weekly average take home pay, up to a maximum of €410   
Previous average take home pay **between €586 and €960** per week  |  Subsidy is subject to ‘tapering’. That means the level of subsidy is calculated by reference to the amount of any additional (‘top up’) payments made by the employer and its effect on the weekly average take home pay.  Subsidy levels are as follows: 

  * Flat rate subsidy of €350 per week, where the employer pays a top up payment **up to 60% of the employee’s previous weekly take home pay**
  * Flat rate subsidy of €205 per week, where the employer pays a top up payment **between 60% and 80% of the employee’s previous weekly take home pay**
  * No subsidy is payable, where the employer pays a top up payment **above 80% of the employee’s previous weekly take home pay**

Tapering is calculated by subtracting the gross 'top up' paid by the employer
from the employee’s previous average take home pay.  
Previous average take home pay **above €960** per week  |  Employee’s whose average take home pay has fallen below €960 can now avail of the scheme, subject to the tapering rules (see above).  No subsidy applies for employee’s whose current pay is more than €960. This is the case regardless of the level of any reduction in pay.   
  
As normal business resumed and the employer’s contribution to the employee’s
pay increased, TWSS payments reduced through tapering – see table above. When
an employer payed normal pre-COVID wages, no subsidy was due.
