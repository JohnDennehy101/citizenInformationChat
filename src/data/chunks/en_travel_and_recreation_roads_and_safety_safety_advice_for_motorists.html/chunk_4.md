##  Crime prevention

Taking some basic precautions can help you avoid becoming a victim of crime
while driving.

  * Always lock your doors and keep your windows closed. 
  * Make sure your handbag and any valuables are kept out of sight. 
  * Carry all luggage or shopping in the boot and leave the back seat empty. 
  * Never leave jackets or coats hanging in the back seat as these can be stolen while your car is stopped in traffic. 
  * Use your horn if someone approaches your windows or a car seems to be trying to make you stop. 
  * Know your route in advance. You should carry a map or use a GPS and avoid having to ask for directions. On longer journeys, tell someone your route and when you expect to reach your destination. 
  * If you think you are being followed, drive into the car park of the nearest Garda station, or if that isnâ€™t possible, drive to a busy public place, for example, a garage forecourt. 
  * Never give lifts to strangers.
