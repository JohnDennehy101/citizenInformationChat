##  Introduction

There are rules that telecommunication providers must follow to treat you
fairly before, during, and after you sign up to a service. Telecommunications
services include phone, internet and TV.

If things go wrong, first complain directly to the service provider. If you
are not satisfied with their response, you can complain to the [ Commission
for Communications Regulation (ComReg) ](https://www.comreg.ie/queries-
complaints/) .

ComReg is a statutory body that regulates the electronic communications sector
(ECS) and the postal sector in Ireland. ECS includes telecommunications, radio
communications, broadcasting transmission and premium rate services.
