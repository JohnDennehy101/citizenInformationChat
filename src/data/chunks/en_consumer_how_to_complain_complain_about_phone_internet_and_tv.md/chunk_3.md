##  Complain to the service provider

If you are not happy with the service you are getting, first contact your
service provider to complain. It is important to act quickly as there can be
very tight timeframes within which complaints can be made.

You should follow the complaint process set out in the provider's Code of
Practice - see ‘How your complaint will be dealt with’ below.

It is a good idea to keep notes of:

  * What happened, including dates and times of conversations 
  * The name of the person you spoke to 
  * What was agreed
