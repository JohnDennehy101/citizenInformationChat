##  How your complaint will be dealt with

ECS service providers must have a code of practice for handling complaints. It
must be available on the home page of their website and it must be easy to
find.

Providers must have:

  * A freephone number, landline, mobile number or a number that is free to all consumers 
  * An electronic way to contact them, for example an email address or an online complaint form 
  * A postal address you can write to 

Under the Code providers must:

  * Only transfer you to another section if the call will cost no more than the cost of a call to a landline number or mobile number 
  * Acknowledge your complaint within 2 working days and include a link to the code of practice 
  * Give you a unique reference number for your complaint 
  * Respond or resolve your complaint within 10 working days 
  * Tell you the timeframe it will be resolved by, if itâ€™s not possible to meet the 10-day deadline 
  * Give you information on how you can escalate the complaint 
  * Have a process in place to record and track your complaint 
  * Give you details about how you can get a refund (if applicable)
