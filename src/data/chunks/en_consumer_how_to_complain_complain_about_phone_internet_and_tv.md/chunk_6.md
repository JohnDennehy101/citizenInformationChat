##  Take your complaint further

If the problem is not resolved, or you are not happy with the response from
the provider, you can contact ComRegâ€™s Consumer Care team for more advice.

The Consumer Care Team can help you with queries about service or contract
issues. If needed, they may be able to escalate the complaint for you to your
service provider.

There is no charge for making a complaint to ComReg.
