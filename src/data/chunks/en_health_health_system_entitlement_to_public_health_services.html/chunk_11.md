###  Posted workers

If you are a posted worker, it means you are employed in one EU member state
and sent by your employer to work in another EU member state for a limited
time.

If you are a posted worker, working in Ireland, you can get a [ medical card
](/en/health/medical-cards-and-gp-visit-cards/medical-card/) if you provide an
E106 form from your country.

Your dependants may also qualify for the medical card if they are not working
in Ireland.
