  * [ Child health services ](/en/health/health-services/children-s-health/child-health-services/) are available to all children 
  * People who have contracted Hepatitis C through blood transfusion and have a [ Health Amendment Act Card ](/en/health/health-services/blood-and-organ-donation/hepatitis-c-and-health-amendment-act-cards/)
