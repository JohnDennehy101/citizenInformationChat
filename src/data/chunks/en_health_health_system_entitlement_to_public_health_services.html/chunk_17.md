##  Public health services for people arriving from Ukraine

If you are [ coming to Ireland from Ukraine ](/en/moving-country/asylum-
seekers-and-refugees/the-asylum-process-in-ireland/coming-to-ireland-from-
ukraine/) under the Temporary Protection Directive you can get the same public
healthcare services as people who live in Ireland.

You are also entitled to a [ medical card ](/en/health/medical-cards-and-gp-
visit-cards/medical-card/) . A medical card allows you to visit a doctor for
free, access other health services and get medicines at a reduced price.
Children aged over 16 must apply for a medical card separately.

You should apply for your medical card using a special [ medical card
application form (pdf) ](https://www.hse.ie/eng/services/healthcare-in-
ireland/medical-card-form-mc1-u-form-ukrainian.pdf) for people from Ukraine.
You can email your completed form to [ PCRS.Applications@HSE.ie
](mailto:PCRS.Applications@HSE.ie) or by post to the address on the form.

You need:

  * Your name, current address and date of birth. 
  * Your [ Personal Public Service (PPS) number ](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/personal-public-service-number/) . 
  * Your doctor’s (GP’s) address, stamp and signature. If you do not know any GPs, one will be assigned to you and your family. 

If you do not speak English, you can ask for an interpreter.

You read about health care services in Ireland in Ukrainian and Russian on the
[ HSE website. ](https://www2.hse.ie/services/healthcare-in-ireland/ukrainian-
refugees.html)
