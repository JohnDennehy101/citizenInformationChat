###  If you are a dependant

If you are living in Ireland and you are the dependant of a pensioner entitled
under EU Regulations, or you are the dependant of a person who is working in
another country covered by the Regulations, you may be eligible for a [
medical card ](/en/health/medical-cards-and-gp-visit-cards/medical-card/) .

You must not be subject to Irish social security legislation (in the case of
child dependants this rule applies to the spouse or person looking after
them).
