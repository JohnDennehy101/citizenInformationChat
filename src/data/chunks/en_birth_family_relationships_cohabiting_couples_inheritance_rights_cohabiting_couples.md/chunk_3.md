##  Rules

If you are married or in a civil partnership, the [ Succession Act 1965
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1965/en/act/pub/0027/index.html) gives your
surviving spouse/civil partner a legal right to a share of your estate (your
possessions) when you die, no matter what you have said in your will.

This does not apply to cohabiting couples. If you are in a cohabiting
relationship and you die without a will, your partner has no automatic right
to any share of your estate no matter how long you have been together. Items
which were jointly owned by cohabitants will automatically pass though to the
surviving cohabitant and not form part of the deceasedâ€™s estate. However, [
Capital Acquisitions Tax ](/en/money-and-tax/tax/capital-taxes/capital-
acquisitions-tax/) may be payable.

If you are or have been married or in a civil partnership, your spouse or
civil partner may be legally entitled to a share of your estate even though
you are now separated from him or her.

Many people are not aware of these issues. It is very important to know your
rights if you are cohabiting.
