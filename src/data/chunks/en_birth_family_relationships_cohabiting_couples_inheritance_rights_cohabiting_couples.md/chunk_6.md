###  Qualified cohabitant

In order to apply for redress you must be a qualified cohabitant, that is, you
must have been:

  * Living with the person for at least 5 years in an intimate and committed relationship or 
  * Living with the person for 2 years in an intimate and committed relationship if you have had a dependent child with your partner 

If you do qualify to apply under the redress scheme, you still may not be
entitled to any provision or share of your partner’s estate if they die. Much
will depend on the financial relationship between you and your partner, each
partner’s financial circumstances, whether your partner was still married or
had children and the size of the estate your partner leaves.
