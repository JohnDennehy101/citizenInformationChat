[ Making a will ](/en/death/before-a-death/making-a-will/)

can ensure that proper arrangements are made for your partner and dependants
and that your property is distributed in the way you wish after you die,
subject to certain rights of spouses/civil partners and children. Tax planning

pay. A solicitor can help you draft a will or you can draft one yourself.
