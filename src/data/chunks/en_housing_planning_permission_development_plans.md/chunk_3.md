###  How long does a development plan last?

A development plan lasts for 6 years. Local authorities must begin work on a
new development plan 4 years after the start date of the last plan.

The [ Planning and Development Bill 2023
](https://www.oireachtas.ie/en/bills/bill/2023/81/) intends to extend the life
of development plans from 6 years to 10 years, with a review after 5 years.
This suggested timeframe will line-up with when Census data is available to
allow for a more strategic approach to planning. The Planning and Development
Bill needs to be passed for this change to come in.
