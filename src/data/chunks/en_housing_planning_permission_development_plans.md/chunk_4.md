##  Do national plans influence local development plans?

Local development plans must be compatible with national and regional planning
strategies, including:

  * The [ National Planning Framework ](https://npf.ie/) , which sets out the national strategy for developments. 
  * The Regional Spatial and Economic Strategies, which detail plans for the 3 regional areas in Ireland 
  * The [ National Climate Action Plan ](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/79659-climate-action-plan-2024/) , which sets out how we will meet our greenhouse gas emission targets 

Each development plan is examined by the [ Office of the Planning Regulator
](https://www.opr.ie/) to ensure that it does not go against any national or
regional strategies.

Development plans must also have an [ environmental report
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/environment/climate-
change/environmental-impact-assessment/#l6a79a) that highlights any
significant environmental effect the plan may have.
