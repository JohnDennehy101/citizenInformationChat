###  If you inherit or are given money:

The income limits for the Supplementary Welfare Allowance Scheme (under which
Rent Supplement is paid) are lower than those for other social welfare
payments. If, for example, you inherit €15,000 this may have no effect on your
main payment (because you can have up to €20,000 capital for the majority of [
means-tested social welfare payments ](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-
welfare-system/means-test-for-social-welfare-payments/means-test/) and €50,000
for Disability Allowance) but it may affect your Rent Supplement (because any
capital over €5,000 is assessed).
