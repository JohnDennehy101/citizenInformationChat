###  If you have to leave your current accommodation:

If there is a good reason why you have to leave your current accommodation
(for example, your landlord is not willing to renew your lease), you can make
an application for Rent Supplement for a new address.

However, you will have to apply again and fill out new application forms for
yourself and your new landlord. There may be a gap in payment while your new
application is processed.

If you qualified for Rent Supplement based on housing need (that is, you are
on a local authority housing list) and you are moving to a new local authority
area, you will have to make a fresh application with the new local authority.

[ Special provisions apply if you are at risk of becoming homeless.
