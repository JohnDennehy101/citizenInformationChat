###  If your children spend some time with one parent and some time with
another:

If you have shared custody or guardianship of a child and that child stays
with you overnight for part of the week, you should check with your local
Community Welfare Officer (CWO) to find out what level of Rent Supplement can
be provided. Each Rent Supplement claim is examined with regard to all of the
circumstances of the case.

If you are not the primary carer and are looking for accommodation to provide
for your children the DSP will take the following into consideration when
processing your Rent Supplement claim:

  * Your family composition and size 
  * Whether any court orders or agreements exist indicating whether joint custody arrangements or access arrangements are in place 
  * Where you live in relation to the primary carer 
  * Whether the child is living with you temporarily as part of an access agreement 
  * Any evidence of a history of continued parental support for the child such as transfer of property to the primary carer, evidence of financial support and other supports such as attending parent-teacher meetings and collecting child from school 
  * Any evidence indicating whether you availed of overnight access to the child(ren) before your application for Rent Supplement 
  * Any evidence from any social worker or medical reports 
  * Whether any letters of consent from the primary carer exist or are required 
  * The content of any Housing Needs Assessment from your local authority
