###  If you marry or start to live with a new partner:

If someone comes to live with you as a spouse, civil partner or cohabitant you
will be treated as a couple and you will be expected to pay a minimum
household contribution of â‚¬40 towards your rent. You do not have to make a new
application for Rent Supplement. However your existing claim will be reviewed
and any income that your spouse, civil partner or cohabitant has from work or
from a social welfare payment will be taken into account. If the person is
working full-time you will no longer be entitled to Rent Supplement.
