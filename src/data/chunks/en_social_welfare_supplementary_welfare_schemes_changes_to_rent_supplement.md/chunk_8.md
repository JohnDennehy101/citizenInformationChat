###  If you go onto an employment scheme:

The following table shows how income from various schemes is treated.

**Scheme** |  **Effect on Rent Supplement**  
---|---  
Work Placement Programme  |  The Work Placement Programme is also considered to be a work-experience programme. There is no additional allowance and it therefore will not affect your Rent Supplement.   
Community Employment Schemes, Rural Social Scheme, Tús  |  You continue to be entitled to claim Rent Supplement if you were claiming it when you started the scheme but your payment may be reduced. The additional household income disregard applies to your payment   
Working Family Payment and Part-time Job Incentive Scheme  |  You can retain Rent Supplement while on these schemes (provided you do not work more than 30 hours a week) and you can apply for Rent Supplement while you are on them. The additional household income disregard applies. See also ‘If you get full-time work’ above for exceptions.
