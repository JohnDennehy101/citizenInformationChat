###  If your landlord raises the rent:

Rent Supplement is not normally paid where the rent payable to the landlord is
over the limits. However, under certain circumstances the CWO can pay Rent
Supplement where the rent is above the relevant limit; this might apply where
there are special housing needs or on a very short-term basis until the tenant
is in a position to reassume responsibility for his/her rent.

If your landlord increases the rent above the rent limit you should contact
your local CWO. Whenever possible, the DSP will support you to stay in your
home.
