###  If you go to hospital or prison:

If you go to hospital for a short stay, or if you are in prison or remanded in
custody for less than 13 weeks, you can continue to get your Rent Supplement.
If the period is longer than 13 weeks, you may no longer qualify or your
family’s payment may be amended. In this case, you should contact your local
CWO - see ‘How to apply’ below.
