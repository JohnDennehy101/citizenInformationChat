##  Introduction

If your circumstances change while you are getting [ Rent Supplement
](/en/social-welfare/supplementary-welfare-schemes/rent-supplement/) you may
have your payment increased or reduced or you may no longer be eligible for
it. The amount of Rent Supplement you get depends on various factors –
including your income, savings, earnings, household composition and the
current local rent limits.

Your [ Rent Supplement payment is calculated ](/en/social-
welfare/supplementary-welfare-schemes/calculating-rent-supplement/) to ensure
that your income is not less than the [ basic Supplementary Welfare Allowance
(SWA) rate for your circumstances ](/en/social-welfare/supplementary-welfare-
schemes/supplementary-welfare-allow/) (for example, €230 for a single person
over 24 and €384 for a couple) minus a minimum contribution of €30 (or €40 for
a couple). If your income increases above this amount, your Rent Supplement
payment may be reduced.

Your Rent Supplement claim is reviewed regularly (generally every 6 months).
When your claim is reviewed you will be asked to fill out a Rent Supplement
Review Form. You should return the form as soon as possible to the officer
dealing with your claim to make sure that there is no delay to your payment.

You should always tell the Department of Social Protection (DSP) immediately
(see ‘How to apply’ below) if there are any changes to your means. You should
also inform the DSP if there are changes to the means of other members of your
household, or to the number of people living in your household.

This document outlines what happens to your Rent Supplement payment in some
common situations.
