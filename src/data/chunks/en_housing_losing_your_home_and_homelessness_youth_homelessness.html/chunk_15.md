###  **Drop-in services for young homeless people**

Many organisations also run drop-in centres during the day, where you can get
food, advice and support.

For example:

  * Focus Ireland has a [ Youth Extension Service ](https://www.focusireland.ie/get-help/extension/) that provides a safe meeting space. It also has shower and laundry facilities, as well as a youth health clinic. 
  * The Peter McVerry Trust runs a [ Youth Caf√© ](https://pmvtrust.ie/services/prevention/youth-cafe/) on Berkeley St, Dublin 7 which offers food, internet access, laundry and shower facilities.
