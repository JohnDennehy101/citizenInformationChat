##  How to qualify for the Part-Time Education Option

There are no specific eligibility criteria for the PTEO. You can be any age
and may be unemployed for any length of time before starting a part-time
course of education.

It is not the same as the [ Back to Education Allowance ](/en/social-
welfare/back-to-education/back-to-education-allowance/) or the [ Education,
Training and Development Option ](/en/social-welfare/back-to-
education/education-training-and-development-option/) .
