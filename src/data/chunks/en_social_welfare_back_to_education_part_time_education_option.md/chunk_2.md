##  Introduction

The Part-Time Education Option (PTEO) allows you to keep your [ Jobseeker’s
Allowance (JA) ](/en/social-welfare/unemployed-people/jobseekers-allowance/)
or [ Jobseeker’s Benefit (JB) ](/en/social-welfare/unemployed-
people/jobseekers-benefit/) or [ Jobseeker's Benefit (Self-Employed) (JBSE)
](/en/social-welfare/unemployed-people/jobseekers-benefit-self-employed/) and
attend a part-time day or evening course of education or training.

You must continue to meet the conditions for Jobseeker’s Benefit, Jobseeker's
Benefit (Self-Employed) or Jobseeker’s Allowance. This means that you must be
able to show that you are still actively looking for full-time work, willing
to take up work and that the course is likely to improve your chances of
getting a job. If you are offered work while on the course you will be
expected to accept the job offer.
