###  **Do you have to stop your car for a Garda?**

The Garda√≠ have a common law power to stop motorists at random in order to
detect and prevent crime. This can be used, for example, to stop cars near
pubs to identify drunk drivers or to check cars passing through an area where
a lot of crime had been committed.

You must also stop your vehicle when required to do so by a Garda under [
Section 109 of the Road Traffic Act 1961
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1961/en/act/pub/0024/sec0109.html#zza24y1961s109)
. They can stop you if they are inspecting vehicle tax, insurance
certificates, driving licenses and road worthiness of vehicles.
