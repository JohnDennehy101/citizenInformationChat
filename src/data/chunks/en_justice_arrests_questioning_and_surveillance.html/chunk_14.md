###  **Ministerâ€™s authorisation for surveillance**

The interception of phone calls and opening of postal letters and packages can
also be authorised by the [ Minister for Justice
](http://www.justice.ie/en/JELR/Pages/Our_ministers) . Only the Garda
Commissioner can apply to the Minister to authorise this in relation to
criminal offences.

If the offence is in relation to state security, the Garda Commissioner and
the Chief of Staff of the Defence Forces (Army) can apply for authorisation.

A judge of the [ High Court
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/justice/arrests/arrests/) is
responsible for monitoring the operation of any interception of phone calls or
packages to ensure the intercepts are only confined to those authorised by the
Minister.
