###  **Right not to be stalked or harassed**

Everyone in Ireland enjoys a general freedom to observe the movements of
others and, indeed, to observe the property of others. While this is true, the
manner of such observations cannot be such as to cause alarm or distress to
another person.

[ Section 10 of the Non-fatal Offences Against the Persons Act 1997
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1997/en/act/pub/0026/sec0010.html#zza26y1997s10)

You have a legal protection from being _stalked_ or harassed. However, this
protection does not prevent lawful surveillance by the Garda√≠ conducted in an
appropriate manner.
