###  **Can the gardaí listen to my phone calls and search my post?**

It is a criminal offence for anyone to intercept a telephone call, letter or
package addressed to someone else, if they don’t have legal authorisation to
do so.

The Gardaí have the power to use technology to keep people under surveillance.
These powers are under the [ Interception of Postal Packets and
Telecommunications Messages (Regulation) Act 1993
](https://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1993/act/10/enacted/en/print) .
