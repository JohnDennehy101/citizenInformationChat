###  Assessment of children in school

An assessment gathers information about how your child learns and what they
learn. The assessment can show how your child is progressing and developing.

Schools must regularly evaluate students and periodically report the results
of the evaluation to students and their parents.

Children's learning and achievements are assessed in primary schools using a
variety of tests and other methods.

All Irish primary schools must carry out three [ standardised tests of
students in English and Mathematics ](https://s3-eu-

during primary school. They are tested:

  * At the end of first class or at the beginning of second class and 
  * At the end of fourth class 
  * At the beginning of sixth class 

The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment has published [ Assessment
in the Primary School Curriculum: Guidelines for Schools (pdf)
](https://www.ncca.ie/media/1351/assessment-guidelines.pdf) . It has also
published [ explanatory leaflets for parents about the standardised tests
](https://www.ncca.ie/en/primary/resources-for-parents#) .

Students will not be tested in special schools, if the school principal
considers that a studentâ€™s disability prevents them from attempting the test.
