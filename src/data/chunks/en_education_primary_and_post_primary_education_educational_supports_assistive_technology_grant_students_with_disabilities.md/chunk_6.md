##  How to apply for the Assistive Technology Grant

Your school should apply for special equipment to the [ Special Needs
Education Organiser (SENO) ](https://ncse.ie/seno-contact-information) with
responsibility for that school. The SENO will apply to the Department of
Education for the Assistive Technology Grant. Medical reports and assessments
may be required.

You will find a [ contact list of SENOs ](https://ncse.ie/for-parents/ncse-
school-information-map) and [ an application form ](http://ncse.ie/wp-

Technology.final_.23.02.15.doc) on the website of the National Council for
Special Education.

Applications for students with visual or hearing impairment should be made to
the [ Visiting Teacher Service for Children with Sensory Impairment
](https://ncse.ie/visiting-teachers) . The Visiting Teacher Service will then
advise the SENO.
