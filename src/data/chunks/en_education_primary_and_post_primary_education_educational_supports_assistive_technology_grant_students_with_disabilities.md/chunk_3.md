##  Help to buy assistive technology

Schools can get an Assistive Technology Grant from the Department of Education

To get a grant, a student must have a physical disability or a general
learning disability that makes ordinary communication through speech and
writing impossible.

The assistive technology grant is for equipment that is essential for the
student to access the school curriculum.

Some examples of assistive technology used include laptop or tablet computers
with modified software, joysticks, keyboards, touch pads, tapes, braille
equipment and audiology equipment.

Not covered by the grant are telephones, smart phones, iphones, ipods,
televisions, plasma screen TVâ€™s, internet access or phone connectivity
charges.

Schools must wait for approval before buying equipment. When the equipment has
been bought, the school should send the full receipts and invoices with claims
for payment. Copies of these should be kept in the school accounts.
Applications can also be made for approved equipment repair.
