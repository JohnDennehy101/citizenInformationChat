##  Can I take my assistive technology home from school?

Usually the equipment provided under the grant is kept in the school. However,
the Board of Management can give permission for a student to use the equipment
at home.

The equipment remains the property of the school and will usually be passed on
to another student or to another school, when the school no longer needs it.

The Board of Management of the school is responsible for insurance,
maintenance, repair and service charges. One teacher should be given the
responsibility for managing the equipment and making sure that it is used
effectively in the school.
