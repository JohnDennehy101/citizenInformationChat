####  3\. Special summons

A [ special summons ](https://www.courts.ie/content/originating-summons-
appearance#_ftn3) is used for cases that involve pure issues of law or very
specific issues of fact.

For example, a special summons will be issued to commence a claim relating to
the [ administration of the estate of a deceased person ](/en/death/the-
deceaseds-estate/dealing-with-the-deceaseds-estate/) . Like summary
proceedings, this is a fast-track procedure where the judge decides the case
by reading affidavits submitted by both sides.
