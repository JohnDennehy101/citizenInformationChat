##  Originating summons

Usually proceedings in the High Court are commenced by an originating summons.

After the summons has been prepared by your barrister, your [ solicitor
](/en/justice/civil-law/representation-in-court/) takes it to the [ Central
Office ](https://www.courts.ie/content/central-office-high-court) to be
_issued_ \- this involves paying the stamp duty. After the stamp duty has been
paid, the summons is stamped and it is ready to be served on the defendant.
There is more information on service below.
