####  2\. Summary summons

A [ summary summons ](https://www.courts.ie/content/originating-summons-
appearance#_mon4) is used when the amount of the plaintiff's claim is easily
quantifiable and the defendant does not have any valid defence.

For example, a summary summons may be used where the plaintiff claims that
they lent the defendant a specific amount of money that has not been repaid.
It is a fast-track procedure where the judge decides the case after reading [
affidavits ](/en/justice/witnesses/affidavit/) submitted by both sides.

However, if it becomes clear to the judge that the defendant has a stateable
defence to the claim, the judge may order that the case be dealt with as
_plenary proceedings_ . This means that pleadings will be exchanged and the
matter may go to trial.
