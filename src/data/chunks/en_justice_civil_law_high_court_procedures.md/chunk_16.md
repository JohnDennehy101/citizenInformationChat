###  The defence contents

The document starts with the title of the proceedings and the record number.

It is up to the defendant to admit or deny the allegations that the plaintiff
has made in their statement of claim. It is also up to the defendant to state
any specific defence that they are relying on. For example, if the defendant
is claiming that the plaintiff's claim has been brought outside of the
permitted [ time limits ](/en/justice/civil-law/taking-and-appealing-a-civil-
case/) , then the defendant should specifically plead that fact in the
defence.

If the plaintiff has made a specific allegation and the defendant fails to
deny that allegation in the defence, it will be assumed that the defendant is
admitting that the allegation is true. For example, if the plaintiff has
claimed in the statement of claim that they were involved in a road traffic
accident and the defence fails to deny that the road traffic accident
occurred, then it is assumed that the defendant is admitting that the road
traffic accident happened. It is not then necessary for the plaintiff to prove
to the judge that the accident occurred.

On the other hand, when the defendant specifically denies a claim that the
plaintiff has made, they are putting the plaintiff _on proof_ of the
allegation. This means that the plaintiff must prove that the claim is true.
For example, if the defence specifically denies that the road traffic accident
occurred, the plaintiff must prove it by introducing evidence in court.
