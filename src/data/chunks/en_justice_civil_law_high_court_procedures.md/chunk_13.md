##  Statement of claim

If the case has been commenced by a plenary summons and the defendant has
entered an appearance, then the next step is for the plaintiff to serve a [
statement of claim ](https://www.courts.ie/content/indorsements-
pleadings#weds5) on the defendant.

The plaintiff has an initial period of 8 weeks to deliver the statement of
claim after the defendant has entered an appearance. If the plaintiff fails to
deliver the statement of claim within the required time, the defendant can
apply to the court to dismiss the action for want of prosecution. The
defendant generally must give the plaintiff 28 days’ notice that they intend
to make such an application before they actually do so. Further information on
such applications can be found in Order 27 of the Rules of the Superior
Courts.

It is not necessary to serve the statement of claim personally on the
defendant – it may be sent by registered post.

The purpose of the statement of claim is to show the defendant the case that
is being made against them and which they have to meet at the trial of the
action.
