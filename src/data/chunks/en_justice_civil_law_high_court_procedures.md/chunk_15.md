##  Delivering the defence

The defendant must deliver a [ defence
](https://www.courts.ie/content/indorsements-pleadings#weds6) to the plaintiff
and they must generally deliver the defence within 8 weeks of receiving the
statement of claim.

If the defendant fails to deliver the defence within the required time, the
defendant can apply to the court to judgment in default of defence. This means
judgment can be given without the need for a full trial. The plaintiff
generally must give the defendant 28 daysâ€™ notice that they intend to make
such an application before they actually do so. Further information on such
applications can be found in Order 27 of the Rules of the Superior Courts.

When they receive the statement of claim, the defendant may decide that not
only have they done nothing wrong and the claim should not have been brought
against them, but that they have a claim against the plaintiff. In those
circumstances, they may wish to include a _counterclaim_ with their defence.
