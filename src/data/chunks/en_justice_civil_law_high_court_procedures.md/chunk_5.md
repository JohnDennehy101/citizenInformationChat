####  1\. Plenary summons

A [ plenary summons ](https://www.courts.ie/content/originating-summons-
appearance#_ftn1) is used to commence proceedings where there is a real
dispute between the parties and/or the amount of the plaintiff's claim is not
specific or easy to calculate.

For example, a plenary summons may be used where the plaintiff claims that
their property was damaged due to the defendant's negligence.

When a plenary summons is issued, the next step is for the parties to exchange
pleadings (see statement of claim and delivering the defence below).
Eventually, the case will be given a date for a trial and there may be
evidence given by witnesses.
