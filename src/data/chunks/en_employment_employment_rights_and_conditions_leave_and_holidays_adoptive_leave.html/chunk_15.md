##  Returning to work after adoptive leave

By law, you have the right to return to the same job with the same contract of
employment. If this would be too difficult for your employer to arrange, they
must provide suitable alternative work on terms that are not ‘less favourable’
than in your previous job.

You have the same rights to return to work as with [ maternity leave
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/employment/employment-rights-and-
conditions/leave-and-holidays/maternity-leave/) , and you must also give 4
weeks’ notice of your intention to return.

If the business where you work is sold while you are on adoptive leave or
additional adoptive leave, your rights on returning to work stay the same
under the new employer.

The law protects you against [ penalisation
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/employment/enforcement-and-
redress/victimisation-at-work/) and [ unfair dismissal
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/employment/unemployment-and-
redundancy/dismissal/unfair-dismissal/) . If you have a dispute with your
employer over adoptive rights, you can complain to the Workplace Relations
Commission – see below.
