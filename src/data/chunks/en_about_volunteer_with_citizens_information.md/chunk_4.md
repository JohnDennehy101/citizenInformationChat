##  If I volunteer with Citizens Information, what will I do?

Citizens Information have a fantastic range of rewarding volunteer roles,
which can vary between local Citizens Information Centres. The main areas you
can expect to volunteer in are:

  * Providing information, advice and client support 
  * Administrative support 
  * Reception and customer service 

You will be asked to commit to either a full day or two half days per week.
Each CIS decides the minimum hours per week required. You will:

  * Work as part of a team with staff and other volunteers 
  * Address a wide range of inquiries from the public 
  * Participate in ongoing training in the main areas of services and entitlements 
  * Develop the expertise to find the right answers and share that information 
  * Take part in regular quality reviews, where the manager sits in with you while you deliver information to the public 
  * Use online systems and databases, so a certain level of computer literacy may be required
