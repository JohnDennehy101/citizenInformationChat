###  Volunteer Board Director

Each Citizens Information Service is managed by a Board of Directors, who are
also volunteers. The overall function of the board is to provide oversight of
the delivery of the Citizens Information Service in accordance with a Service
Level Agreement (SLA) with the funder, the Citizens Information Board (CIB).

High standards of corporate governance in CIS voluntary boards are critical to
ensuring a positive contribution to the delivery of information, advice and
advocacy services.
