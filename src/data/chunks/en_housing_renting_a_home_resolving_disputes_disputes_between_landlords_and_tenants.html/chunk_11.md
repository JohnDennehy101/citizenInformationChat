###  Enforcement of determination orders

The District Court is responsible for the enforcement of RTB determination
orders (previously this work was done by the Circuit Court). If any of the
parties do not comply with a determination order, they can be reported to the
RTB, which can apply for a District Court Order directing them to comply. You
can also apply to the District Court directly if you are affected by someone's
failure to comply with an order. Read more about [ enforcement of orders
