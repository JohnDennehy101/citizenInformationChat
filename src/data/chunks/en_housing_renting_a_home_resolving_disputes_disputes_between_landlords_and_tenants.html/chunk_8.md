###  Mediation

Mediation means that an impartial mediator helps the parties come to an
agreement together. Mediation can only go ahead if the RTB thinks it is the
most appropriate way to resolve the dispute and if both parties agree to it.
You can opt for face-to-face mediation or telephone mediation.

  * In telephone mediation, the mediator contacts each side individually in a series of telephone calls. You will not have to speak to the other person involved in the dispute. 
  * In face-to-face mediation, the mediator arranges a private hearing, where each party can state their case 

You do not need evidence for the mediation process. You submit a [ Mediation
Position Statement (pdf)
](https://www.rtb.ie/images/uploads/forms/Mediation_Position_Statement_\(English\).pdf)
outlining:

  * What you hope to get from the mediation process 
  * The issues you feel have prevented the issue from being resolved so far 

You can also send documents that highlight these issues. The mediator uses
your statement and documents to understand what is important to you in the
dispute.

The mediator aims to help both sides to reach a resolution that is acceptable
to everyone. A report of the mediation is sent to each side, along with
letters accepting or rejecting the proposed agreement. There is a cooling-off
period of 10 days, after which the parties must return either the acceptance
letter or the rejection letter to the RTB. If both accept the mediation
agreement, it becomes a legally binding determination order of the RTB. The
RTB does not publish the outcome of mediated cases. Find out more about the [
