###  Time limits for referring disputes to the RTB

Certain types of dispute should be referred to the RTB within a set timeframe.
You must refer:

  * Disputes about rent to the RTB within 28 days of the tenancy ending 
  * Disputes about [ notices of termination ](/en/housing/renting-a-home/tenants-rights-and-responsibilities/if-your-landlord-wants-you-to-leave/) to the RTB within 90 days of receiving the notice, as long as you have kept your [ tenant’s obligations ](/en/housing/renting-a-home/tenants-rights-and-responsibilities/tenants-rights-and-obligations/) . If you have broken these obligations the notice period is 28 days. 
  * Disputes about [ rent increases ](/en/housing/renting-a-home/landlords-rights-and-responsibilities/rent-increases-in-private-rented-housing/) to the RTB either: 
    * Before the rent increase is due to take effect (you must get at least 90 days’ notice of a rent increase) 
    * Within 28 days of receiving formal notice of the new rent (whichever is later) 

The RTB may extend these limits in exceptional circumstances.
