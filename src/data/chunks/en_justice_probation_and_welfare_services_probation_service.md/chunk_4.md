###  **Pre-sanction report (or probation report)**

If a pre-sanction report is requested, you will be assessed to see if you are
suitable for a non-prison sentence.

This report will include detailed information about you, including:

  * Personal and family circumstances 
  * Your attitude towards the crime you have committed 
  * Whether you accept responsibility for your actions 
  * Whether you are an alcoholic or drug addict 
  * Information that shows you are committed to improving your behaviour (for example, attending a drug treatment clinic) 
  * Anything in your life that might indicate a risk of reoffending 

The report may also suggest conditions for a non-prison sentence. For example,
that you should move away from a residential area where you were getting into
trouble or that you must attend treatment for an addiction.
