###  **Community service**

If the court decides that you can serve your sentence in the community rather
than in prison, they may grant a **community service order** . This allows you
to do unpaid work in the community instead of going to prison.

To be eligible for [ community service
](http://www.probation.ie/EN/PB/WebPages/WP16000055) , you must be 16 or over
and your sentence must be 12 months or less.

The judge will tell you:

  * How many hours of work you must complete (between 40 and 240 hours) 
  * The prison sentence that will be imposed if you do not complete the work 

The Probation Service organises the work placement and is responsible for
informing the court if you do not complete the work.
