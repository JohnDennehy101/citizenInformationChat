##  Assessing offenders for the courts

If you are in court for a criminal offence and you plead guilty or are found
guilty, the [ judge
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/justice/courtroom/judge/) can ask the
Probation Service to complete an assessment report before deciding on your [
sentence ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/justice/criminal-
law/criminal-trial/types-of-sentences/) .

There are [ 2 types of assessment reports
](http://www.probation.ie/EN/PB/WebPages/WP16000033) :

  * Pre-sanction report (also known as a probation report) 
  * Community service report 

The judge can request one, or both, of these reports. The case is adjourned
until the report is ready to be presented to the court.

The Probation Service can only make a recommendation in its report. The judge
will [ decide how to proceed with the case
](http://probation.ie/en/PB/Pages/WP16000087) .

Generally, assessment reports are completed within 8 weeks for adults and
within 4 weeks for young people.
