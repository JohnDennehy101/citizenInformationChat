####  Labour market activation

€10 million is allocated to the Springboard initiative to provide part-time
higher education opportunities for unemployed people.

€20 million has been allocated for a new Labour Market Activation Fund which
will be specifically targeted at the long-term unemployed and will deliver
over 6,500 education and training places in 2012.

Training and further education programmes provided through the new further
education and training authority (SOLAS) and the VECs will focus actively on
helping unemployed people to return to the labour force. Both SOLAS and the
VECs will liaise closely with the National Employment and Entitlements Service
in the Department of Social Protection.
