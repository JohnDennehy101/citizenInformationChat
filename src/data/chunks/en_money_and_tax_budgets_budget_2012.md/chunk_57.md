####  Changes to contributory State pensions

Currently a person with an average of 20 - 47 PRSI contributions per year over
their working life receives a weekly State pension of â‚¬4.50 less than a person
with a yearly average of 48 or more PRSI contributions. A lower pension will
be payable to new applicants for State pension who have a yearly average of
less than 48 PRSI contributions. (September 2012)

Currently, late claims for certain contributory pensions can be backdated on a
reducing scale for up to 5 years. This backdating period will be reduced to a
maximum of 6 months. This applies to State Pension (Contributory and
Transition), Surviving Civil Partner's Contributory Pension and Widow(er)'s
Contributory Pension. (April 2012)
