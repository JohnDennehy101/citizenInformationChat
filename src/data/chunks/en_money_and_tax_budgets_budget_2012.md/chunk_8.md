###  Value-Added Tax (VAT)

The standard rate of VAT will be increased from 21% to 23% from 1 January
2012\. This only affects goods which are already liable to the 21% rate.

The rate of VAT will be reduced from 21% to 13.5% on district heating, for
example, where heating is supplied from a central source to a number of
business premises within a building. This brings this form of heating in line
with other energy suppliers.

Open farms will be liable to charge VAT at 9% on admission fees from 1 January
2012.
