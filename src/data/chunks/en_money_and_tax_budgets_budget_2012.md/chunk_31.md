####  Measures to incentivise timely farm transfers

Full retirement relief from CGT for intra-family transfers will be maintained
for individuals aged 55 to 66. An upper limit of €3m on retirement relief is
introduced for business and farming assets disposed of within the family
(where the individual transferring the assets is aged over 66 years). This
will incentivise earlier transfer of farms.

(The current unlimited amount applies for a transitional period of 2 years for
individuals currently aged 66 or who reach that age before 31 December 2013.)

The current upper limit of €750,000 for assets transferred outside the family
for individuals aged between 55 and 66 years will be maintained. The upper
limit for retirement relief for business and farming assets transferred
outside the family is reduced from €750,000 to €500,000 for individuals aged
over 66 years.

(The current upper limit of €750,000 applies for a transitional period of 2
years for individuals currently aged 66 or who reach that age before 31
December 2013.)

Full details of these measures will be set out in the Finance Bill.
