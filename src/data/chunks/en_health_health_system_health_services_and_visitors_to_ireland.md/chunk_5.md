##  Visitors from the EU/EEA and Switzerland

If you are visiting Ireland, you can use a valid [ European Health Insurance
Card ](/en/travel-and-recreation/travel-abroad/european-health-insurance-
card/) issued by your home country to access healthcare.

If you have an EHIC, you can get necessary medical treatment in Ireland free
of charge. EHIC only covers public healthcare, not private. You should bring
your European Health Insurance Card with you when you are travelling to
Ireland.

Certain categories of people, such as posted workers, are eligible for medical
cards under EU rules â€“ see the further information section on [ medical cards
](/en/health/medical-cards-and-gp-visit-cards/medical-card/) .
