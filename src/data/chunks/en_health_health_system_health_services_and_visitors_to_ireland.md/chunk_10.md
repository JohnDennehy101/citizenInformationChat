##  People who are not entitled to free or subsidised health services

If you are not ordinarily resident in Ireland and you are not entitled to
health care under any of the circumstances described above, you may have to
pay the full cost for any services provided. In cases of hardship, the HSE may
provide urgent necessary treatment at a reduced charge or without charge.
