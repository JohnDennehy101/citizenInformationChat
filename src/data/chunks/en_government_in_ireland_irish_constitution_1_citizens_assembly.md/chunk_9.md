##  How the Assembly works

Each Assembly agrees its own rules and procedures for how it will carry out
its business. The Government and the Oireachtas agree Terms of Reference
before a Citizensâ€™ Assembly starts, which are guidelines that help define the
work of the Assembly.

The Assembly may invite and accept submissions from people who are interested
in any of the issues being discussed, such as expert advisory groups.

When the Assembly finishes considering each issue, it develops a series of
draft recommendations and votes on each. It then reports to the [ Houses of
the Oireachtas ](/en/government-in-ireland/houses-of-the-oireachtas/dail-
eireann/) and makes recommendations. The next step for the Government is to
provide a response to each recommendation and arrange for a debate in the
Oireachtas.

If the Government accepts a recommendation that the Constitution should be
amended, its response in the Oireachtas will include a timeframe for the
holding of a referendum.
