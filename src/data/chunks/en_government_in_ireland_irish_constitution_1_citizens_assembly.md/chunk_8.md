##  Members of the Citizens' Assembly

A Citizensâ€™ Assembly is typically made up of 99 randomly selected members of
the public and one appointed chairperson.

Before 2022, members of the Citizens' Assembly were selected at random from
the electoral register.

Since 2022, any adult resident in the State is eligible to become a member of
a Citizens' Assembly. This includes people who are not Irish citizens and who
are not enrolled on the electoral register.

Invitations are sent to randomly-selected households. From those who reply
agreeing to take part, members are selected to reflect Irish society in terms
of age, gender, social class and regional spread.
