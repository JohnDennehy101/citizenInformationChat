###  **Employment rights, unequal treatment and discrimination claims**

You can use the mediation service if you feel your employment rights have been
violated. The option of using the mediation service is available to you on the
[ WRC online complaint form
](https://www.workplacerelations.ie/en/complaints_disputes/refer_a_dispute_make_a_complaint/)
. Both parties can arrive at a solution through agreement rather than through
an investigation or hearing or formal decision.

In certain cases, you may be offered the Early Resolution Service (ERS) which
is part of the Mediation Service. If both parties are agreeable, a
representative from the ERS contacts them by phone to resolve the dispute
through mediation.

Members of the public can also use mediation to get help with cases related to
unequal treatment or discrimination in public services.
