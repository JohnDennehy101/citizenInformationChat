###  **In-person mediation**

Sometimes talks about a complaint are more suited to a face-to-face process.

The WRC provides in-person mediation in:

  * Equality cases 
  * More complex employment rights cases like [ unfair dismissal ](https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&cx=006414847141085406041:ntchszasfve&q=https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/employment/unemployment-and-redundancy/dismissal/unfair-dismissal/&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwjMibrYn_CAAxV7VEEAHbi6Ar0QFnoECAIQAg&usg=AOvVaw1h4z2Q82FYUwe8TjRuvG6U)
  * Cases where the parties agree in-person meetings are more appropriate 

Face-to-face mediation involves a series of meetings that take place on the
same day.

The mediator talks separately with each party. This allows the mediator to:

  * Discuss the issues confidentially with each side 
  * Explore possible solutions without prejudice to anybodyâ€™s position. This means without negatively affecting either side 

The mediator may later invite the parties to meet, for a discussion
facilitated by the mediator.

All information shared in both separate and joint talks is confidential and
will not be shared with the other party unless this is agreed.
