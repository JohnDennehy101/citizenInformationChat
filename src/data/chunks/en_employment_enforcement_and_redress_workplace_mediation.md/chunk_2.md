##  What is workplace mediation?

Workplace mediation is a voluntary process that aims to resolve workplace
disputes and disagreements, particularly between individuals or small groups.

The [ Workplace Relations Commission
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/employment/enforcement-and-
redress/workplace-relations-commission/) provides a [ Mediation Service
](https://www.workplacerelations.ie/en/what-we-
do/industrial%20relations/mediation_services/) . It is a confidential service
that gives employees and employers in dispute, a chance to work with a
mediator to find a mutually agreed solution to the problem.

A mediator is a trained professional who will not make any decisions, but help
both parties understand each other.

Workplace mediation is voluntary and both sides must agree to participate and
to work towards a solution to the problem.

If no agreed solution is reached, other ways of resolving the issues have to
be used, such as [ formal adjudication
](https://www.workplacerelations.ie/en/what-we-do/employment-rights-
information/adjudication_services/) .
