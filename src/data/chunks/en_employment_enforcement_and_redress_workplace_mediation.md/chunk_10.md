###  **Telephone mediation**

The WRC can decide if the issue is suitable for telephone mediation.

The mediator contacts the employer to see if they are willing to engage. If
they agree, the mediator consults with the parties separately by telephone or
email to try and help them reach a resolution.

Conversations are confidential and the parties decide what the mediator can
and cannot share with the other side.
