##  How is my application to the Community Welfare Service assessed?

Your application for financial support will be examined by a Community Welfare
Officer. The CWO will look at all your sources of income and your expenses.
They will then decide if you qualify for a payment.

A payment can be a once off payment or a regular supplement.

The CWO may want to meet with you to help them decide if you should get a
payment.

A CWO can refer you to other state agencies and voluntary organisations
depending on your needs. For example, you may be referred to the [ Money
Advice and Budgeting Service (MABS) ](/en/money-and-tax/personal-
finance/debt/mabs-service/) .
