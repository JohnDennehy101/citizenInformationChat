###  Appealing a decision

If you are unhappy with a decision made by a CWO, you may appeal it.

You can appeal a CWO’s decision on a weekly [ Supplementary Welfare Allowance
](/en/social-welfare/supplementary-welfare-schemes/supplementary-welfare-
allow/) , Mortgage or [ Rent Supplement ](/en/social-welfare/supplementary-
welfare-schemes/rent-supplement/) to the Social Welfare Appeals Office.

Other payments such as the [ Additional Needs Payments ](/en/social-
welfare/supplementary-welfare-schemes/additional-needs-payment/) cannot be
appealed to the Social Welfare Appeals Office, but you can request the CWO’s
decision be reviewed by another DSP officer.

There is no charge for getting a decision reviewed or making an appeal.
