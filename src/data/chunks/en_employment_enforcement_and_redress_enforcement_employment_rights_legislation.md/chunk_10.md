###  Compliance notices

If an inspector finds that you have breached employment legislation, you can
receive a [ compliance notice

. The notice sets out how you should fix the issue. It is an offence not to
comply with a compliance notice.

days. You may make a further appeal to the Labour Court if you are not
satisfied with the actions taken by the [ Circuit Court ](/en/justice/courts-
system/circuit-court/) .

can still face other consequesnces on top of the compliance notice:

  * Employees can take action against you in relation to any alleged breach of employment law 
  * You can be prosecuted for an offence under employment laws 

Compliance notices may be used in relation to breaches of the legislation
