###  Breaches involving unpaid wages

In a case relating to an employee's unpaid wages, you may receive a letter
requesting evidence that you as the employer are complying with the law.

If you do not respond or your response is inadequate, the Inspection Services
will make a second inspection.

You will receive a warning that any further or new breaches discovered mean
you will be prosecuted.

Where breaches of the Protection of Young Persons (Employment) Act 1996 are
found these are referred for prosecution after a first inspection.
