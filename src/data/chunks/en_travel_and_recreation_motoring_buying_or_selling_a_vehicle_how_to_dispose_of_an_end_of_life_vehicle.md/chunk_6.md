##  How much does disposing an end-of-life vehicle cost?

You cannot be charged for leaving an end-of-life vehicle at an authorised
treatment facility, if:

  * You are the registered owner of that vehicle and 
  * The **vehicle is intact**

If important parts of your car are gone (like the engine, gearbox or
transmission), or there is waste inside your car, **you might be charged.**
