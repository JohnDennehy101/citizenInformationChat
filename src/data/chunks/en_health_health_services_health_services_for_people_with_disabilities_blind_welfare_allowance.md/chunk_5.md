###  **Means testing your income**

When you apply for the Blind Welfare Allowance, the HSE will financially
assess your income and your partner's income. You must provide information on
and proof of:

  * Payments you get 
  * Property you own 
  * Investments 
  * Government welfare or education schemes 

The HSE will also ask you to list children aged under 24 who are dependent on
you.
