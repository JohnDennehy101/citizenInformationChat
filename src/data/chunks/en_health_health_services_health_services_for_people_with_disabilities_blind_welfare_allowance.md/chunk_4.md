###  **Certification of your level of vision**

If you do not get the [ Blind Pension
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/social-welfare-
payments/disability-and-illness/blind-persons-pension/) you will need one of
the following items to show the HSE your level of vision to qualify for Blind
Welfare Allowance:

  * An ophthalmic assessment report from an eye specialist, for example, a consultant ophthalmologist or an orthoptist. 
  * A letter from [ Vision Ireland ](https://vi.ie/) . If you have been using their services and they have your medical reports. 

To qualify for Blind Welfare Allowance, your vision must have "best vision
equal to or less than 6/60 in the better eye or if the field of vision is
limited, the widest diameter of vision subtending an angle of not greater than
20 degrees".
