##  Introduction

The judge in an Irish courtroom usually sits on a raised platform at the top
of the court and wears white collars and a black gown.

In the past, judges in Ireland were referred to as "My Lord", or "His
Lordship". Now, they are addressed as "Judge" or referred to as "The Court".
The only exception to this is in the case of the Chief Justice and Presidents
of the various lower courts, who are addressed by their titles.
