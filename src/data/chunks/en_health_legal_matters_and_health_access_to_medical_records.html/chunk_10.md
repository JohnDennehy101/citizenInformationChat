##  Data protection to access your medical information

You are entitled to find out if there is information about you held on record,
to access those records and to have them corrected if they are inaccurate.
This applies to public and private healthcare providers. Data held must be
accurate and up to date. The rules on data protection are set by the [ General
Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) ](/en/government-in-ireland/data-
protection/overview-of-general-data-protection-regulation/) .

There may be situations where giving you the information on your records is
likely to cause serious harm to your physical or mental health. In this case,
you will not be given information

When you or somebody you know dies, GDPR laws do not apply to the personal
data. You can read about how to access a deceased personâ€™s records below.

Find information on the [ Data Protection Commission website
](https://www.dataprotection.ie/) about [ accessing your personal information

The Commission also deals with [ complaints in relation to data protection
