##  How to access somebody elseâ€™s medical records

You can use FOI to access the medical information of:

  * Your child if you are the parent or guardian 
  * An adult you care for if they are unable to exercise their rights 

The head of the public body will only grant access to the records if they
consider it is in the best interests of your child or person you care for.
