###  Determination orders

When a mediated agreement is reached, or the adjudicator or Tribunal make a
decision, the RTB issues a determination order. A determination order gives
the outcome of the case and details the conditions that each party must meet,
and by when. The RTB publishes all determination orders. Determination orders
are enforced through the District Court. You can appeal a Tribunal decision to
the High Court, but only on a point of law.

If a determination order states that a tenancy should end between 30 October
2022 and 31 March 2023, the tenancy termination date will be postponed until
April at the earliest. This is because an eviction ban was in place at this
time.
