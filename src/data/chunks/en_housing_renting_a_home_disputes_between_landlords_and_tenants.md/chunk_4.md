##  RTB's dispute resolution service

[ The Residential Tenancies Board (RTB) ](https://www.rtb.ie/) offers a
dispute resolution service to landlords and tenants. Most of the process is
online, with the majority of hearings held virtually and mediation often
completed by phone. Any agreement reached with its help, or adjudicated by it,
is legally binding. Landlords, tenants or other people who have been directly
affected, such as neighbours, can begin the process. **Landlords must be
registered with the RTB to use the service but tenants can use it even if
their landlord has not registered the tenancy.**

The service covers disputes about deposits, lease terms, termination of
tenancies, rent arrears, market rents, complaints by neighbours, breaches of
statutory obligations by either landlord or tenant and any other matters
related to the tenancy. It can also deal with disputes about terms of a lease
or other tenancy agreements that are not specified in the Residential
Tenancies Act 2004. **You do not need legal representation when taking a case
to the RTB.**

Since, 27 October 2022 the default process for dispute resolution is
mediation. This means that the RTB now prioritises resolving disputes through
its mediation service.
