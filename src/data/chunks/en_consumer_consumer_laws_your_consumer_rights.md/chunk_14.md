##  Breaches of consumer law

The [ Consumer Rights Act 2022
](https://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2022/act/37/enacted/en/html) strengthens
the enforcement powers of consumer protection agencies like the Competition
and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC) and the Commission for
Communications Regulation (ComReg).

The CCPC can take action against traders who do not give you the remedies or
refunds you are entitled to or who use misleading or aggressive practices.

Companies can be fined by the Courts following enforcement action taken by the
CCPC.
