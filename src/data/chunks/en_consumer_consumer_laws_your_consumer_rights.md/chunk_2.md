##  Introduction

When you buy something in Ireland or the EU, you have strong rights.

The laws are designed to:

  * Make you feel confident when shopping in stores or online 
  * Make sure you have enough information to make informed decisions (based on facts) 
  * Provide redress options if things go wrong 

By law, sellers or suppliers (known as ‘traders’) must treat you fairly, for
example, by making sure products and services are safe and of a high standard.
