###  **Sick leave within your first 13 weeks of employment**

If you are sick within the first 13 weeks of employment, you are not entitled
to statutory sick pay. You may still be entitled to Illness Benefit.

If you are off work sick and getting Illness Benefit when the 13-week
requirement is met, you cannot use statutory sick days during that period of
sick leave.
