###  What is normal daily pay?

Your normal daily pay includes any regular bonus or allowance which does not
change from week to week (but excludes overtime or commission).

If your **pay changes from week to week** (for example, because of regular
bonus payments or allowance), your sick pay is the average of your pay over
the 13 weeks before you are on sick leave.

**Remember that sick pay is capped at a maximum of â‚¬110 a day** .
