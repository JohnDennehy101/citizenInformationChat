##  If my employer already has a sick pay scheme

Your employer may offer you more generous sick pay arrangements under its own
scheme. If so, your sick leave will be dealt with under that scheme.

That scheme must be more favourable, when viewed as a whole, than the
statutory sick pay scheme if it is to apply.
