##  Having problems getting sick pay

If you do not get the sick pay you are due, contact your employer to try to
resolve the issue informally first.

If you cannot resolve the issue directly with your employer, you can make a
formal complaint to the [ Workplace Relations Commission (WRC)
](https://www.workplacerelations.ie/en/contact_us/contact-details/) .
