##  What is the Statutory Sick Pay scheme (SSP)?

The Statutory Sick Pay (SSP) is the legal minimum sick pay.

The entitlement to paid sick leave is expected to be phased in as follows:

  * 2024 - 5 days covered 
  * 2025 - 7 days covered 
  * 2026 - 10 days covered 

The Government is currently reviewing ESRI research on the impact of statutory
sick leave before deciding on any further increases.

Sick days can be taken as consecutive days or non-consecutive days.

The sick pay year is the calendar year, so it runs from 1 January to 31
December.

You can get sick pay of 70% of your normal weekly pay, up to a maximum €110 a
day – see more about how your sick pay is calculated below.

The rules on the SSP are set out in the [ Sick Leave Act 2022
](https://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2022/act/24/enacted/en/html) . **The
entitlement to sick pay started on 1 January 2023** .
