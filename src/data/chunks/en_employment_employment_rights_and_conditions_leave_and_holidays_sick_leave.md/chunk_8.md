##  Do I need a medical cert to get sick pay?

Under the sick leave legislation, you must be certified by a medical
practitioner as unable to work to qualify for statutory sick pay. You should
be certified from day 1 of your sick leave.

You have a right to SSP from the first day you are off sick. Your employer
cannot apply ‘waiting days’ before you get statutory sick pay.
