##  One-Parent Family Payment

[ One-Parent Family Payment (OFP) ](/en/social-welfare/families-and-
children/one-parent-family-payment/) is not paid to a person who is in a
relationship and living with that person whether they are of the opposite or
of the same sex. To qualify for OFP, you must be widowed, separated, divorced,
unmarried, have a dissolved civil partnership, or be a prisonerâ€™s spouse or
civil partner. You must not be cohabiting. Cohabiting is when a couple in a
relationship live together, but they are not married or in a civil
partnership.

If you separate, divorce or dissolve your civil partnership, you must live
apart for at least 3 months before making a claim for One-Parent Family
Payment. If you are cohabiting and your relationship breaks down, you can
apply without having to wait 3 months.
