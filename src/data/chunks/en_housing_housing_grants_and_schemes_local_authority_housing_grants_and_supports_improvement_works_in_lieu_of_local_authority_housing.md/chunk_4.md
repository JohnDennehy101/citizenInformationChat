##  How much does it cost?

The local authority will organise and pay for the work. You will pay a charge
to the local authority for the works based on how much you can afford. The
charge will last for a maximum of 15 years. If you have paid for the full cost
of the works during the 15-year period, the charge will stop. If you sell your
home during the 15 years, or before you have repaid the cost of the works, you
will have to make a repayment to the local authority.
