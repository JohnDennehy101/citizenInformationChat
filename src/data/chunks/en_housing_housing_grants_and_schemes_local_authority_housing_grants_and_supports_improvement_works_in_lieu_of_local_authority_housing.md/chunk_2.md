##  What is the Improvement Work in Lieu of Local Authority Housing Scheme?

The Improvement Work in Lieu of Local Authority Housing Scheme (IWILS) allows
your local authority to improve privately owned accommodation, which is
unsuitable for you, instead of providing you with local authority housing.

For example, if are on the social housing waiting list and you decide to move
into a privately owned home, the local authority may pay to extend or improve
the home, so you can live there. If the home is suitable for you when the work
is complete, your housing needs will have been met and you will be removed
from the social housing waiting list.

The [ Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1992
](https://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1992/act/18/section/5/enacted/en/html)
sets-out the main rules of this scheme.
