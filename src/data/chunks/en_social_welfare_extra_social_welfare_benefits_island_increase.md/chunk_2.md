##  Introduction

People living on islands can face extra expenses travelling to the mainland to
avail of services. If you are getting one of the social welfare payments
listed below and living on certain islands off the coast of Ireland you can
get an increase in your social welfare payment (sometimes referred to as an
Island Allowance). The purpose of the increase is to compensate for the
additional costs of living on an island off the coast of Ireland.

People getting certain pensions from another EU state are entitled to an
increase for living on a specified island.
