##  What is the process for buying back the equity share?

If you want to buy back some or all of the FHS equity share in your home, you
must get your home valued. The valuation must be completed by an FHS Approved
Valuer and you will pay for this. You can find a list of FHS Approved Valuers
on the FHS customer portal. The valuation is valid for 12 months.

You send this valuation report to the FHS and ask them for a ‘redemption
quote’. The redemption quote will tell you how much it will cost you to pay
off some or all of the FHS equity in your home.

This redemption quote is based on the valuation you get. If you built your own
home, the value of your site is discounted from the property value when the
redemption payment is calculated.

You must provide a number of supporting documents when you pay this off. The [
First Home Scheme website ](https://www.firsthomescheme.ie/faqs/redeeming-
your-equity-share/) has information on what you need.
