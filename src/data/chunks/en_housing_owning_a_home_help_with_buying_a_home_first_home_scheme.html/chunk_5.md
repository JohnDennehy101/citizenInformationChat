building a new home**

**You are a first-time buyer if** :

  * You have not previously bought or built a property to live in. 
  * You do not own or have an interest in any property in Ireland or abroad. 

You will not qualify as a first-time buyer if you have owned a home abroad or
have previously inherited a home.

you no longer have a financial interest in it because** :

If you are buying or building the property with someone else, they must also
be a first-time buyer or fresh start applicant.
