##  How much funding can I get and are there any costs?

The First Home Scheme is a shared equity scheme. This means you get funds from
the scheme in return for a percentage ownership of the property. You can buy
back this percentage if and when you want. If you do then you will fully own
the home.

You can get up to 30% of the market value of your new property with the First
Home Scheme. This is reduced to 20% if you are also getting the [ Help to Buy
Scheme ](/en/housing/owning-a-home/help-with-buying-a-home/help-to-buy-
scheme/) . The minimum amount you can get is 2.5% of the property purchase
price, or â‚¬10,000, whichever is higher.
