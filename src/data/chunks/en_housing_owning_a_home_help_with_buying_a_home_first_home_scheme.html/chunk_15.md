###  What if I add value to my home?

If you make a material change to your home that increases its market value,
this increase will not be taken into account when valuing your property. For
example, if you extend your home, the increase in the value of the home this
brings will be excluded from the valuation. The [ First Home Scheme website
has more information about what is considered a material change
](https://www.firsthomescheme.ie/faqs/redeeming-your-equity-share/) .
