##  What is the Tenant Home Purchase Scheme?

The Tenant Home Purchase Scheme is an extension of the First Home Scheme. It
expands the FHS so you qualify if your landlord is selling the property you
are renting and you want to buy it.

The Tenant Home Purchase Scheme is slightly different to the FHS because you
can buy a second-hand home (your rental home) and the FHS is only available
for new homes. This also means you will not qualify for the [ Help to Buy
Scheme ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/housing/owning-a-home/help-
with-buying-a-home/help-to-buy-scheme/) , which only applies to new homes.

You must have a [ valid notice of termination
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/housing/renting-a-home/if-your-
landlord-wants-you-to-leave/#8cf07e) to qualify for the Tenant Home Purchase
Scheme. You must send a copy of this and your mortgage approval in principle
when you apply.

Apart from these minor differences, all the other requirements and
qualification criteria for the FHS apply to the Tenant Home Purchase Scheme.

You apply for the Tenant Home Purchase Scheme online on the [ First Home
Scheme website ](https://application.firsthomescheme.ie/main) .
