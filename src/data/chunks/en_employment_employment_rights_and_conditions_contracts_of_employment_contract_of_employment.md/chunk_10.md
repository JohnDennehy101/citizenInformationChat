###  Parallel employment

Your employer cannot restrict you from taking up additional employment outside
your work for that employer (unless they have objective grounds, see below).

Your employer can only restrict you from taking up parallel employment if this
is proportionate and based on objective reasons. The reasons could include:

  * Health and safety 
  * To protect business confidentiality 
  * To avoid conflicts of interest 
  * To comply with statutory or regulatory obligations and professional standards 

You must get details of any restriction and the objectives reasons for the
restriction, either in your contract of employment or a written statement.
