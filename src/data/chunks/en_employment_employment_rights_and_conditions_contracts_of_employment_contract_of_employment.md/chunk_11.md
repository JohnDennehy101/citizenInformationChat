###  Probationary period

Your contract can include a ‘probationary period’.

From 1 August 2022, probation periods can’t be more than 6 months. In
exceptional circumstanced your probation can be extended for up to a further 6
months (up to a maximum of 12 months in total).

The probation can be extended where it in your interests or where you have
been on extended leave, such as sick leave, during your probation. It can also
be extended where it is justified by the nature of the work, for example
public service employment.

  * The contract of employment is in writing and 
  * The probation or training lasts for one year or less and is specified in the contract 

However, the Unfair Dismissals Acts will apply if you are dismissed due to:

  * Trade union membership or activity 
  * Pregnancy-related matters 
  * Entitlements under maternity protection, parental leave, adoptive leave, parent’s leave, paternity leave, force majeure leave or carer’s leave legislation
