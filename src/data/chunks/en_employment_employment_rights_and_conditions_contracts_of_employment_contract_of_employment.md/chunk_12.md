####  If you are dismissed during probation

If you are being dismissed during a probation period due to misconduct, you
have a right to [ ‘natural justice’, which means due process and fair
procedures ](/en/government-in-ireland/irish-constitution-1/constitution-
fundamental-rights/) . However, this right does not generally apply to a
dismissal for poor performance, particularly where your contract expressly
allows for dismissal for poor performance during probation.

You may be able to take a claim for ‘wrongful dismissal’ during your probation
period if you have less than 12 months service. _Wrongful dismissal_ happens
when an employer does not meet an implied or an express term in your contract
of employment, or does not give you adequate notice. You can sue the employer
for breach of your contract in the [ civil courts ](/en/justice/civil-
law/taking-and-appealing-a-civil-case/) .
