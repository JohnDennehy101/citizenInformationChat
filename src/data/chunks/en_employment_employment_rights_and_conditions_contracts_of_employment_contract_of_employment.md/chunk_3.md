##  Written statement of terms of employment

**Within the first 5 days** of starting a job, your employer must give you
part of your ‘written statement of terms of employment’. This written
statement must include the core terms of employment (such as how your pay is
calculated).

**Within 1 month** of starting the job, your employer must give you the
remaining terms of your employment in writing (such as your entitlement to
annual leave).

If you are required to work outside the State for at least one month, you must
be given a written statement of the terms and conditions of employment,
**before you leave the country** . This must include the country or countries
you will work in, the duration of the work, the currency you will be paid in,
and any other benefits for working abroad.
