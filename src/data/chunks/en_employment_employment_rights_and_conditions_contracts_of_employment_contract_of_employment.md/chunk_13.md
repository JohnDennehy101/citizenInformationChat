###  Changes to your contract of employment

If there is a change in employment law (such as an increase to Parentâ€™s
leave), this automatically changes the terms in your contract of employment.

Any other changes to your contract (changes not set out in law), must be
agreed between you and your employer. This means your employer cannot change
the terms of your contract without your consent.
