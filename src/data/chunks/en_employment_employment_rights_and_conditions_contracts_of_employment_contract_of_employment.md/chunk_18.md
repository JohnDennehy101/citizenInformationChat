##  How to make a complaint

If your employer does not give you written details of your terms of
employment, you should speak to them about this directly.

If you cannot resolve your complaint informally, you can complain to the
Workplace Relations Commission (WRC) [ using their online complaint form
](https://www.workplacerelations.ie/en/e-complaint_form/) . You must have at
least one monthâ€™s continuous service with the employer before you can complain
to the WRC.
