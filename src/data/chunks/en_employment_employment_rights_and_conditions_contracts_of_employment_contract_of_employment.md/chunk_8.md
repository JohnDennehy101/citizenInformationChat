###  Disciplinary and grievance procedures

Employers must have written grievance and disciplinary procedures, as set out
in the Workplace Relation Commission (WRC) [ Code of Practice: Grievance and
Disciplinary Procedures
](https://www.workplacerelations.ie/en/what_you_should_know/codes_practice/cop3/)
. Your employer must give you a copy of these procedures at the start of your
employment.

Within 28 days of starting work, your employer must also give you **written
details** of the procedures to be followed before you can be dismissed. This
is set out in the [ Unfair Dismissals Acts 1977â€“2015
](http://www.lawreform.ie/_fileupload/RevisedActs/WithAnnotations/HTML/EN_ACT_1977_0010.htm)
.
