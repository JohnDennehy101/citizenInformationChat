##  Review process for current wards of court

If you are an adult ward of court, the court will review your case to see if
you still need help making decisions on your own. The review will give you:

  * An opportunity to be heard by the wardship court when your cases are being reviewed 
  * Access to representation and legal aid 
  * A functional assessment of capacity using the new guiding principles that the court will apply 

If the wardship court declares that the ward lacks capacity, even with the
assistance of co-decision-maker, this declaration will be kept under review
afterwards by the Circuit Court.
