###  Buying a house

Property cannot be bought on behalf of a ward as a pure investment.

A property may be bought on behalf of the ward if they

  * Have sufficient means 
  * Are able to reside in the community 
  * Do not have adequate or suitable accommodation elsewhere 

If the ward is in residential care and their dependants need to be housed,
property can be bought in the name of the ward for their benefit.
