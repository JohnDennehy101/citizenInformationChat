###  Resuming own affairs

An application by a Ward to be discharged from Wardship must be made to the
Registrar of Wards of Court in writing by the Ward or by a solicitor on their
behalf. The application should be based on medical evidence to the effect that
the Ward is now sound of mind and capable of managing their own affairs.
