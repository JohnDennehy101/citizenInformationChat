###  The role of the Committee

When a person was made a ward of court, the High Court appointed somebody
appropriate to act on their behalf – this person or persons is known as the
“committee”. The committee’s powers come from the court. The Committee can
only do what the court authorises them to do. [ The Office of Wards of Court
](https://www.courts.ie/content/office-wards-court) must be kept informed of
all actions taken on behalf of the Ward.

The Committee is one of the people who may make the application to court to
have the Ward’s capacity reviewed. This will lead to the person being
discharged from wardship. The role of the Committee will then end and a new
decision-making-arrangement will be put in place. For instance, the Committee
may be appointed by the former ward as a decision-making assistant or co-
decision-maker. The wardship court may also appoint a former Committee as [ a
decision-making representative
](https://decisionsupportservice.ie/services/decision-supporters/decision-
