##  What is constructive dismissal?

Constructive dismissal is where your employerâ€™s action or inaction makes the
situation in work so intolerable you feel you have no choice but to resign
from your job.

You make a claim for constructive dismissal under the Unfair Dismissals Act.

You should only resign as a last resort after using all other available
options to resolve the problem. You should use your company's complaints or
grievance procedure before you resign and claim you were constructively
dismissed.

To be successful in a constructive dismissal claim, **you will have to prove**
that your resignation was justified (you had good reasons to leave).

This is different to an [ unfair dismissal ](/en/employment/unemployment-and-
redundancy/dismissal/unfair-dismissal/) case, where your employer must prove [
fair grounds for your dismissal ](/en/employment/unemployment-and-
redundancy/dismissal/fair-grounds-for-dismissal/) .

If your claim for constructive dismissal is successful, you may be:

  * Compensated for your loss of earnings caused by the dismissal 
  * Placed back in your job under reinstatement 
  * Placed back in your job under re-engagement
