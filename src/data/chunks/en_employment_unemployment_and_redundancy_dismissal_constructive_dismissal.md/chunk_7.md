###  If you have to resign

If you cannot resolve the issue with your employer and you feel you have no
choice but to resign, you may claim you were constructively dismissed.

You must have 12 months' continuous service with your employer to bring a
claim for constructive dismissal. However, in certain cases the requirement of
12 monthâ€™s service [ does not apply
](https://www.workplacerelations.ie/en/what_you_should_know/ending%20the%20employment%20relationship/dismissal/)
.

You must bring your claim within 6 months from the date your job ended. This
time limit may be extended to 12 months where there are exceptional
circumstances that prevented you from making a claim within 6 months.
