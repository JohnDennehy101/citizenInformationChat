##  Reasons for claiming a constructive dismissal

You can claim constructive dismissal if you can show that your employerâ€™s
action:

  * Is an actual breach of your contract of employment or is serious enough for you to resign 
  * Shows that they no longer intend to be bound by one or more of the essential terms of the contract 
  * Was unreasonable (see examples below) 

Behaviour by your colleagues that goes unchecked by your employer can also be
taken into account in a constructive dismissal claim.
