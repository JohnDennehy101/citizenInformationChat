###  Before you resign

If you feel you are being forced to leave your job because of your employer's
actions, you should raise this with your employer as soon as possible. Give
your employer an opportunity to discuss the issue and try to resolve it.

Before you resign, you should:

  * Use your companyâ€™s complaints or [ grievance procedure ](https://www.workplacerelations.ie/en/what_you_should_know/codes_practice/cop3/)
  * Use any outside industrial relations procedures available to you (for example using a trade union or [ mediation ](/en/employment/enforcement-and-redress/workplace-mediation/) ) 
  * Look for detailed advice as this is a complex area of law, it can be difficult to prove constructive dismissal
