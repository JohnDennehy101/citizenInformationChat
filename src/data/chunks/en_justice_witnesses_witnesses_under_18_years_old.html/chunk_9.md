##  Video recording of statements

In certain situations, a video recording of a witness statement can be
admitted as evidence. This is only allowed if the victim, or any other witness
giving evidence, is under 18 years old, and the accused is charged with a
sexual offence, child trafficking or child pornography.

In these cases a video recording of the child’s statement can be admitted so
they don’t have to give evidence in person in open court. [ Section 16 of the
Criminal Evidence Act 1992
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1992/en/act/pub/0012/sec0016.html) sets out
the rules for videotaping children’s statements.

There are a number of rules about videotaped statements and their
admissibility in court including:

  * The video recording must be relevant 
  * The child witness must be available to be cross-examined by the defence after the video is played at the trial (cross-examination may be by [ video link ](/en/justice/witnesses/remote-hearings-and-video-link-evidence/) and using an intermediary) 
  * The prosecution must serve notice that it plans to admit a videotaped interview in evidence and must give the accused a reasonable opportunity to view the videotape 
  * An edited version of the videotape may be played to the court, but this can only happen if the accused agrees to it and the judge allows it 

Ultimately, the judge decides whether a videotape can be admitted in evidence.
The judge considers whether admitting the videotape will be unfair to the
accused.
