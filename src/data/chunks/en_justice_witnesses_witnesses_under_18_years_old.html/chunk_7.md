##  Giving evidence by video-link

In cases involving a sexual or violent offence, witnesses who are under 18
years of age may be allowed to give evidence by video-link, unless there is a
good reason why they should not. [ Section 13 of the Criminal Evidence Act
1992 ](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1992/en/act/pub/0012/sec0013.html) , as
amended, sets out the rules for how evidence can be given by video-link.

To do this you sit in a private room and give your evidence by live video-
link. Someone from the court will stay with you to give you any help you may
need. A television monitor in the court shows your image, and you have a
television monitor in your room, which show you what is happening in the
courtroom. This means that you do not have to go into the courtroom or see the
accused.

When you give evidence by live video-link, the judge and the barristers do not
wear wigs or gowns in court. The judge can decide to let an intermediary (for
example, a social worker) ask the questions. The questions should be asked in
a way that is appropriate for the age and mental ability of the witness.
