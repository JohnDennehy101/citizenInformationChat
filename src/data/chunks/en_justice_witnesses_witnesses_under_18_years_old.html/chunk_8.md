##  Giving evidence from behind a screen

In certain circumstances, a physical screen or partition can be positioned in
the courtroom, so the witness can their give evidence in the court without
having to see the accused when doing so. This option is available at the
judgeâ€™s discretion if the witness is under 18 and the proceedings are about a
sexual or violent offence. This is done to protect the witness from secondary
or repeat victimisation.
