##  Introduction

There are 2 types of referendum in Ireland – a constitutional referendum and
an ordinary referendum.

**Constitutional referendum**

[ Bunreacht na hÉireann
](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/d5bd8c-constitution-of-
ireland/?referrer=http://www.taoiseach.gov.ie/eng/Historical_Information/The_Constitution/)
is the basic law or [ Constitution ](/en/government-in-ireland/irish-
constitution-1/constitution-introduction/) of Ireland. It was enacted in 1937
and has been amended several times.

The Constitution can only be amended if the proposed amendment has been
approved by the people of Ireland in a referendum. This gives the people the
opportunity to decide whether or not the law will change.

As of 2021, 38 constitutional referendums had been held and 32 have been
approved. They are [ listed on taoiseach.gov.ie

**Ordinary referendum**

An ordinary referendum does not relate to amending the Constitution. An
ordinary referendum would be held if the President decided that a Bill
contained a proposal of such national importance that the will of the people
should decide its outcome.
