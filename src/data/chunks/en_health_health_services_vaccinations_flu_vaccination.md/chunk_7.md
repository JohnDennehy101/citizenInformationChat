##  When to get the flu vaccine

The flu vaccine is usually available from early October until late April every
year.

It will protect you against the most common strains of flu going around each
winter. As strains of flu change every year, you should get a new flu vaccine
every flu season.

When you get the flu vaccine, your immune system will start to produce
antibodies. Then, if you come into contact with the flu virus, these
antibodies will fight it and stop you from getting sick.

The flu vaccine does not contain live viruses â€“ this means it cannot give you
flu.
