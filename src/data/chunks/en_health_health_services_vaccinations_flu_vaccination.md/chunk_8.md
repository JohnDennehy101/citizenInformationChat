##  Flu vaccine during pregnancy

If you are pregnant, you should get the flu vaccine as soon as possible. This
is because pregnant people are more at risk of complications from flu.

If you are pregnant through two flu seasons (for example, your pregnancy goes
from the end of one flu season to the beginning of another), you may need to
get two flu vaccines (one in each flu season). [ Read more about the flu
