##  Personal searches

A Garda can ask you to stop at any time. In certain circumstances, such as
when you are driving, you must stop if asked to by a garda. A Garda can search
you, without your consent, if the Garda has reasonable suspicion that you have
committed certain offences. This includes people under the age of 18. The
Garda should tell you why you are being searched.
