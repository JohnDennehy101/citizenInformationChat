###  **If your child’s time at school is reduced by the school**

Your child should attend the full school day and the full school week.
Sometimes a school will use a _reduced school day_ for a child, for example,
to help a child back into a school routine. However, a reduced school day
should only be put in place in limited circumstances and for a set period of
time.

A _reduced school day_ is when the school decides that:

  * A student arrives to school after the usual starting time or leaves before the end of the school day 
  * A student may not attend the full 5 days each week 

The Department of Education has introduced [ guidelines on the use of reduced
school days ](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/63545-the-use-of-reduced-
school-days/) . The guidelines recommend that a student should not be on a
reduced school day for more than 6 weeks and there should be a plan to support
the student’s return to a full-time school day.

**From 1 January 2022** , if the school is restricting your child’s full
attendance at school, the school must notify the [ Tusla Education Support
Service (TESS) ](https://www.tusla.ie/) that your child’s school day is
reduced. Schools must also review the circumstances for any child currently on
reduced school days before the start date of the guidelines.

If your child’s school day is reduced the school must ensure that:

  * The reduced school day or week is necessary and lasts only as long as necessary 
  * You (or the student if they are over 18) consent to the reduced school day or week. If you don’t consent and the school implements the reduction anyway it is the same as [ being suspended from school ](/en/education/primary-and-post-primary-education/attendance-and-discipline-in-schools/school-discipline#l284dd) . 

If you have any concerns about the use of reduced school days for your child,
you can contact the [ Tusla Education Support Service ](https://www.tusla.ie/)
for advice.
