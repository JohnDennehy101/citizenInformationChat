##  Introduction

If you lose or leave your job, you have certain rights and entitlements
including the right to be paid for days you have worked.

If you have not been paid the right amount or if you are still owed some
wages, you have legal rights.

This page can help you take steps to get paid the money you are owed after
leaving a job.
