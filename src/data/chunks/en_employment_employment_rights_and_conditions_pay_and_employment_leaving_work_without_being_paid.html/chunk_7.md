##  Make a complaint about non-payment of wages

If you cannot resolve the issue directly with your employer, you can make a
formal complaint about non-payment of wages to the [ Workplace Relations
Commission ](/en/employment/enforcement-and-redress/workplace-relations-
commission/) . You should apply using the [ online complaint form
](https://www.workplacerelations.ie/en/Complaints_Disputes/Refer_a_Dispute_Make_a_Complaint/)
.

You must make a complaint within 6 months of the date of the deduction - this
is the date your wages were due to be paid. The time limit may be extended for
up to a further 6 months, if there was reasonable cause for the delay.

Further information is available in this [ explanatory booklet on the Payment
of Wages Act 1991 (pdf)
