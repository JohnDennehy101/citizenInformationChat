##  If you think your final pay is wrong

If you think your final pay is wrong, try speaking informally to your former
employer. Ask them to explain anything you do not understand on your payslip,
or why you have not been paid.

If you disagree with your employer's calculations, explain what you think the
correct amount is. Ask them to pay the money you are owed as soon as possible.

If you cannot resolve the problem informally, you can make a formal complaint
â€“ see below.
