###  When can you have an abortion?

You can have an abortion **up to 12 weeks of pregnancy** (that is, no more
than 84 days since the first day of your last period). You will need to begin
the process earlier than this.

After 12 weeks, you can only have an abortion in [ exceptional circumstances
](https://www2.hse.ie/conditions/abortion/methods/after-12-weeks/) , if the
pregnancy:

  * Puts your life at risk 
  * Risks serious harm to your health 
  * Is likely to lead to the death of the foetus before birth or within 28 days of birth because of a problem with its development 

The earlier an abortion is carried out, the simpler and safer it will be.
