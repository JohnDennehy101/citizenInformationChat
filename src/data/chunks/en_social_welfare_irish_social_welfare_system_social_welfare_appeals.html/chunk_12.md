####  **When the SWAO receives your appeal**

The Social Welfare Appeals Office (SWAO) will:

  * Send you a letter to let you know that they have received your appeal. 
  * Notify the Department of Social Protection of the appeal. The Department must then send any relevant documents to the SWAO. 

When the Department receives notice of an appeal, it reviews the original
decision to decide whether it should be revised in your favour.
