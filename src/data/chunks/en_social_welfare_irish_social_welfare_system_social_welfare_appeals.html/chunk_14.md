###  If you don't agree with the Appeals Officer's decision

If you think there was a mistake made in relation to the law or the facts of
the case, you can appeal to the Chief Appeals Officer. You will need to send
them a written request for a revised decision and include the new evidence.

You should state the grounds on which you are seeking a revised decision and
why you believe a mistake has been made regarding the law or the facts.
