####  **Priority**

In general, appeals are dealt with in the order in which they have been
received. However, Supplementary Welfare Allowance appeals (including [ Rent
Supplement ](/en/social-welfare/supplementary-welfare-schemes/rent-
supplement/) ) are prioritised.

The Appeals Officer may decide your appeal based on written evidence. This is
called deciding the appeal _summarily_ .
