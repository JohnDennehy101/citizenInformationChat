###  Documents

When you are abroad, you may need to use Irish documents, for example, a birth
certificate, either for personal or business reasons. You may be asked to have
them authenticated by the Department of Foreign Affairs. Authenticating a
document means verifying that a signature, seal or stamp on a document is
genuine. Another type of authentication is an [ apostille stamp
](http://www.notarypublic.ie/apostille-and-legalisation/) which is an
international certification. It authenticates or legally certifies a document
and it may be required by countries that have acceded to the [ Hague
Convention ](http://www.hcch.net/index_en.php) .

Since 16 February 2019, EU citizens moving to another EU country no longer
need to get a stamp to prove that their [ public documents
](https://beta.e-justice.europa.eu/551/EN/public_documents) are authentic.
This means that birth, death, marriage and civil partnership certificates
issued by the [ General Register Office (GRO)
](https://www.gov.ie/en/campaigns/af7893-general-register-office/) and the [
certificate of freedom to marry ](/en/birth-family-relationships/getting-
married/getting-married-abroad/) issued by the Department of Foreign Affairs
are accepted by authorities in other EU states as authentic.

To reduce the need for translation within the EU, multilingual standard forms
are also available on request from the GRO for birth, death, marriage and
civil partnership certificates.
