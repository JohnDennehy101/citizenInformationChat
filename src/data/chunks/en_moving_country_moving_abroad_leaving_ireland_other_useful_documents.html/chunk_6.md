###  Fingerprints

If you are planning to travel to a country for which you need a visa, you may
be asked to provide fingerprints as part of your visa application. To get a
certificate of your fingerprints you should contact your local Garda station
to find out which Garda stations provide this service. It involves taking your
fingerprints and giving you a card with a set of your fingerprints and stamped
by the Garda station.
