##  Documents to bring with you

It is always highly recommended that you bring your passport with you, even if
you are [ travelling to the UK ](/en/government-in-ireland/ireland-and-the-
uk/common-travel-area-between-ireland-and-the-uk/) and your passport is not a
requirement for travel. In fact, given Ireland is not a member of the [
Schengen Agreement, ](/en/government-in-ireland/european-government/european-
union/schengen-area/) you will find that you are required to carry your
passport when travelling to most other countries. If you need information
about [ applying for an Irish passport ](/en/travel-and-
recreation/passports/applying-for-or-renewing-an-irish-passport/) you can find
this information elsewhere on this site.

In addition to your passport, other useful documents include:

  * Your birth certificate 
  * Your [ driving licence ](/en/travel-and-recreation/motoring/driver-licensing/full-driving-licence/) and/or [ international driving permit ](/en/travel-and-recreation/motoring/driver-licensing/international-driving-permit/)
  * Your student card 
  * Any visas or work permits you may need 
  * [ European Health Insurance Card ](/en/travel-and-recreation/travel-abroad/european-health-insurance-card/) and/or other documents relating to health insurance 
  * Your curriculum vitae 
  * Any relevant certificates from education or training courses you have completed 
  * References for work 
  * Emergency contact information 
  * Contact names and numbers of your family/friends/next-of-kin in Ireland 

Before you travel, it can be useful to make photocopies of the most important
of these documents. Carry the photocopies separately so that you will have
some form of identification in the event that they are stolen.

If you are going to remote areas where you will be far from an Irish embassy,
leave two passport photographs and two signatures, ideally on a passport
application form, with friends in Ireland or near an Irish embassy. If your
passport is lost or stolen this could speed up the process of replacing it.

If you are travelling in countries where there are a lot of restrictions, it
can be useful to bring a number of passport photographs with you, for use on
additional visas and permits.
