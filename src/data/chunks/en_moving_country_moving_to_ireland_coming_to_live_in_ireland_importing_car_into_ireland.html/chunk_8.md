###  VRT and registration

You have to register your vehicle in Ireland within 30 days. You have to pay
Vehicle Registration Tax unless the vehicle is exempt.

You register the vehicle at a National Car Test (NCT) centre. You have to [
book an appointment online ](https://www.ncts.ie/1195) or by phoning
01-4135975. Before taking your vehicle for registration you must register the
[ certificate of conformity ](https://www.revenue.ie/en/online-
services/services/vehicle-services/electronic-certificate-conformity.aspx)
with Revenue.

When you go to register you should have the following documents:

  * A completed Vehicle Purchase Details [ VRTVPD2 form ](https://www.revenue.ie/en/importing-vehicles-duty-free-allowances/documents/vrt/form-vrtvpd2.pdf) if it is a vehicle for private (non- commercial) use 
  * The vehicle logbook (also called a V5C) 
  * A certificate of conformity (for new vehicles) 
  * An invoice with the date of purchase clearly shown 
  * Proof of your name and address 
  * Proof of your identity 
  * Proof of your PPS number 
  * An exemption certificate issued by Revenue if you are claiming an exemption from VRT 

If the vehicle was imported from Northern Ireland and your invoice is dated
more than 30 days before your appointment, you must have details of where the
vehicle was stored. If the vehicle was imported to Northern Ireland from the
EU, you must have the shipping details that show the date the vehicle arrived.
If the vehicle was imported from Great Britain, or another non-EU country, you
need the ‘single administrative number’ and the date it was issued by customs
at the point of entry.

You can buy your registration plates at the test centre and pay the VRT that
is due.

registering your imported vehicle ](https://www.ncts.ie/vrt-home/vrt-faq/) .
