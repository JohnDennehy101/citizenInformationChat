##  Types of vehicles

There are many different types of motorised vehicle. For the purposes of
Vehicle Registration a _vehicle_ is:

  * Designed for road use 
  * Powered by mechanical or electrical means (or a combination of both) 

The following are types of mechanically propelled vehicles and their VRT
categories:

Other types of vehicles may be classified as mechanically propelled for VRT,
depending on certain factors.

Ebikes or battery powered scooters are mechanically propelled if they can move
without you pedalling or scooting them. If the power only works after you have
got the scooter or bike moving by cycling or scooting it, it is not classed as
mechanically propelled.
