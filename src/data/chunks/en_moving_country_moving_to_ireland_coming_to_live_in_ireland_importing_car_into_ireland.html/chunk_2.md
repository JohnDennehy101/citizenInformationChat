##  Introduction

If you are moving to Ireland, you may decide to bring your vehicle with you.
You must register the vehicle in Ireland and you may have to pay additional
charges and taxes. You can find more information on our page about [ bringing
your vehicle to Ireland ](/en/returning-to-ireland/planning-your-journey-
home/bringing-your-vehicle-back-to-ireland/) .

If you live in Ireland and decide to buy a car from another country, you
should check all the extra costs that are involved in registering and taxing
the vehicle in Ireland.

This page guides you on the steps involved to bringing a vehicle and
registering it in Ireland if you are doing it for yourself, rather than using
a car dealer.
