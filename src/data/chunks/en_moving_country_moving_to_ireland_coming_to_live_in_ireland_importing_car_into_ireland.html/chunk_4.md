##  Importing a vehicle from the UK

If you decide to buy a new or used car from the United Kingdom (UK) directly
(not through a dealer in Ireland), you must arrange to pay the additional
charges yourself.

You must pay:

  * A customs duty if the vehicle is arriving from Great Britain, and not Northern Ireland (see ‘Customs declarations and duties’ below). 
  * VRT when the vehicle is registered (unless it is exempt) 
  * VAT on all new cars, and on used cars imported from Great Britain (including vehicles imported to Northern Ireland from Great Britain). 

If you are buying a vehicle from Northern Ireland which was previously
registered in Great Britain, you should make sure that you get documents to
show that customs duties were paid on arrival into Northern Ireland.
