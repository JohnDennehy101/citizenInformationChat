###  Customs declarations and duties

Under the trade agreement between the UK and the EU, items that have their
origin in the UK can be exported to the EU (including Ireland) without customs
duties or tariffs. But the rules on country of origin are complicated and mean
that even new vehicles bought from Great Britain may be liable to customs
charges if, for example, the vehicle was imported into Great Britain from
another country before being sold.

Northern Ireland continues to be treated as part of the EU under the trade
agreement. This means vehicles imported from Great Britain to Northern Ireland
have to go through customs and may have customs duties applied to them.

If you import a vehicle from Great Britain, you must make a customs
declaration.

  * **If the vehicle’s country of origin is the UK** , you do not have to pay customs duty if it is a new vehicle. Customs charges apply to all used vehicles imported from Great Britain. 
  * **If the vehicle’s country of origin is the EU or a third country** (for example Japan or USA), you have to pay customs duty 

If you buy a vehicle from Northern Ireland, you do not have to make a customs
declaration. But you must have proof that a customs declaration was made when
the vehicle arrived in Northern Ireland from Great Britain (if applicable).
