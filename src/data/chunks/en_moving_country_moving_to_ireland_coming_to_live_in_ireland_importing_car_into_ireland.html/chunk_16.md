##  Vehicle Registration Tax

Vehicle Registration Tax (VRT) is a tax you must pay when you first register
your vehicle in Ireland. If you have imported a vehicle, you must pay VRT and
get the vehicle's registration certificate showing that you have paid VRT. If
you delay in registering your vehicle or paying Vehicle Registration Tax you
have to pay a penalty. Your vehicle could be also be seized.

You must register the car and pay the VRT at a National Car Testing Service
(NCTS) centre. The inspector examines your car to make sure that you are
paying the correct VRT. In the case of cars and small vans, the amount of VRT
payable is based on a percentage of the recommended retail price, which
includes all taxes. This price is known as the Open Market Selling Price
(OMSP). You can get an estimate of the VRT due from the [ Revenue Vehicle
Registration Online Enquiry System
