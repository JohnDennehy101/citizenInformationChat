##  Importing a vehicle from outside the EU

If you are importing a car from outside the EU you have to:

  * Pay a customs duty 
  * Register the vehicle 
  * Pay VRT unless you are exempt 
  * Pay VAT unless the vehicle is exempt 
  * Pay [ motor tax ](/en/travel-and-recreation/motoring/motor-tax-and-insurance/motor-tax-rates/)
  * Get [ motor insurance ](/en/travel-and-recreation/motoring/motor-tax-and-insurance/motor-insurance/)

The customs charge must be paid when the vehicle enters the EU (including
Ireland) or Northern Ireland.

If the vehicle is 4 years or older, you must have it [ tested by the National
Car Testing Service ](/en/travel-and-recreation/vehicle-standards/national-
car-test/) . If the vehicle has a current EU Roadworthiness Certificate, you
can have the time remaining on the certificate recognised in Ireland. This
means you will not have to take an NCT, until your certificate expires.
