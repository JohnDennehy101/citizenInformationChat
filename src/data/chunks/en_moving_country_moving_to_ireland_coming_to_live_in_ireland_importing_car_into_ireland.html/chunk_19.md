##  Exemptions from VRT

There are different reliefs and exemptions from VRT. Even if you do not have
to pay VRT, you must still register your vehicle when you come to Ireland. You
can find information on [ VRT reliefs and exemptions
](https://www.revenue.ie/en/importing-vehicles-duty-free-allowances/guide-to-
vrt/reliefs-and-exemptions/index.aspx) , and [ VRT reduction for certain
electrical vehicles ](https://www.revenue.ie/en/vrt/guide-to-vrt/calculating-
vrt/electric-hybrid-vehicles.aspx) for certain electric vehicles, on Revenueâ€™s
website.

**Transferring residence:** If you are moving to live in Ireland, when you
apply for a VRT exemption, you must meet certain requirements as regards your
vehicle and your residency both here and abroad. You can find information
about when to apply for exemption, the evidence you need and the application
forms in the Revenue leaflet, [ Transfer of Residence
](https://www.revenue.ie/en/importing-vehicles-duty-free-allowances/guide-to-
vrt/reliefs-and-exemptions/transfer-of-residence.aspx) .

**Temporary exemptions:** In certain cases foreign-registered vehicles may be
imported into Ireland temporarily by a non-resident without the requirement to
pay VRT or register the vehicle. You can find information about [ Foreign
Registered Vehicles Temporary Exemptions
](https://www.revenue.ie/en/importing-vehicles-duty-free-allowances/guide-to-
vrt/reliefs-and-exemptions/temporary-exemption.aspx) on the Revenue website.

If you are moving to Ireland and are among those exempt from paying VRT you
cannot sell your vehicle for more than 12 months after the vehicle is
registered. If you are required to pay VRT, then you can sell your vehicle
here in Ireland when you wish, once it has been registered.

If you have a query about VRT exemptions, appeals or transfer of residence, [
