###  Vehicle registration plates

When you register and pay the VRT, a registration number will be assigned to
your car. You must display the registration number within 3 days. You are
committing an offence if you fail to display the new registration number and
you can be fined by An Garda Síochána. You can get [ vehicle registration

numbers/) from the NCTS centre or any motor accessories dealer.
