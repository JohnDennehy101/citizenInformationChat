##  Can I be searched by a Customs officer?

Travellers can only be searched by Customs officers if an officer has reason
to suspect that:

  * They are carrying prohibited or uncustomed goods (uncustomed goods are goods that are imported, which are more than the traveller's allowance and not declared to Customs). 
  * They are carrying drugs on their person. 

If a Customs officer suspects that the person is carrying uncustomed or
prohibited goods, they must go before a superior officer of the Customs and
Excise service who will decide if there are sufficient grounds to search.

In practice, most searches made by Customs officers are because the officer
suspects the person is carrying drugs. If you are to be searched on suspicion
of carrying drugs:

  * You must understand the reason for the search. If Customs officers need to search a child or a person with a disability, it must be done in the presence of a parent or guardian. 
  * You can only be searched by an officer of the same sex 
  * Nobody of the opposite sex can be present if you have to remove clothing for the search (other than a hat, coat jacket, gloves, or similar articles of clothing) unless another person is needed because of your violent conduct 
  * You have the right to request that the search be carried out by a medical practitioner 
  * The search must be conducted in a room that the public does not have free access to. Windows must be screened, and doors secured to ensure complete privacy. 

If Customs officers find controlled drugs, you may be prosecuted. You may be
arrested or proceeded against later by summons.

If you refuse to be searched, you can be arrested without a warrant by the
Customs officer and may be prosecuted. If you are arrested by Customs
officers, you will be taken to the nearest police station to be charged with
an offence.

Customs officers keep records of all the searches that they conduct.

Additionally, anybody who is detained by Customs officers has the right to:

  * Access a solicitor 
  * Access a doctor 
  * Inform a relative or third party about their situation 

If you feel you have been unfairly treated by Customs officers, you can make a
complaint - see ‘Complaints about customs searches’ below.
