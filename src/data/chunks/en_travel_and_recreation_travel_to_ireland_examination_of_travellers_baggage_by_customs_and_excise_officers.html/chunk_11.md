##  Complaints about customs searches

If you feel that Customs officers have treated you unfairly, you should
complain to the Collector or other local manager. If you are unhappy with the
response, you can ask to have your complaint referred to the Customer Service
Manager in the relevant Region or District. Revenue has published a leaflet
(CS4) on their [ complaint and review procedures (pdf)
](https://www.revenue.ie/en/corporate/documents/customer-service/cs4.pdf) .
