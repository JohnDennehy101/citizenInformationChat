##  Subsidiary protection

Subsidiary protection is a type of international protection.

If you do not qualify as a refugee, you may be granted subsidiary protection
if there is a risk that you would suffer serious harm if returned to your own
country.

The risk of harm is not based on who you are, but because there is a general
risk of harm in the country. This could be, for example, because the country
is at war.
