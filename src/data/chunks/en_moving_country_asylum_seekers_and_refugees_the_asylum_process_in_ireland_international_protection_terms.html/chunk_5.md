###  Well-founded fear of persecution

A ‘well-founded’ fear means that the fear is based on what the person feels,
and also evidence of persecution or harm (or threats of persecution or harm).

There is no complete definition of what ‘persecution’ means. The persecution
must be a serious violation of a person’s human rights, or it may be a number
of less serious violations, which when taken together amount to a serious
violation of a person’s human rights.

Serious violations include acts of violence against the person. They may also
include legal, administrative or judicial acts that are discriminatory.
