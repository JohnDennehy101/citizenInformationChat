##  Asylum seeker

An asylum seeker is a person who has left their country and is seeking
protection in another country. Asylum seekers are also called international
protection applicants.

Seeking asylum is a human right. When you ask for asylum at the border of a
country, that countryâ€™s authorities must examine your application. If you ask
for asylum in Ireland, you must [ make an application for international
protection ](/en/moving-country/asylum-seekers-and-refugees/the-asylum-
process-in-ireland/applying-for-refugee-status-in-ireland/) . While you are
waiting for a decision on your application, the Irish State gives you [
accommodation, food and medical care ](/en/moving-country/asylum-seekers-and-
refugees/services-for-asylum-seekers-in-ireland/direct-provision/) . You are
entitled to [ legal aid ](/en/moving-country/asylum-seekers-and-
refugees/services-for-asylum-seekers-in-ireland/legal-aid-for-asylum-seekers-
in-ireland/) to help you with your application and appeals (if needed).

When your application has been processed, you may be either:

  * Declared a refugee 
  * Granted subsidiary protection status 
  * Granted permission to remain for humanitarian reasons 
  * Refused international protection 

You can [ appeal a refusal ](/en/moving-country/asylum-seekers-and-
refugees/the-asylum-process-in-ireland/if-your-application-for-refugee-status-
is-refused/) to the International Protection Appeals Tribunal.
