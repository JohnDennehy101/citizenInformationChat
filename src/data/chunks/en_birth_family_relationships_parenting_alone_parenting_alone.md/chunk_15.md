###  Temporary guardianship

If you are parenting alone, temporary guardianship allows you to nominate
another adult for a brief period to care for your child should you become
seriously ill and unable to care for your child.

You need to complete a [ special form to nominate a temporary guardian (pdf)
](https://www.treoir.ie/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/nomination-form.pdf) , in
which you can set out your wishes on any limitations on the temporary
guardian. The nominated person must then apply to the District Court if you
cannot carry out your parental role due to serious illness.
