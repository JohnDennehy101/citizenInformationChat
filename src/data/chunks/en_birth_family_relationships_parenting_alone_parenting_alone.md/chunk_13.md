##  Taxation

The [ Single Person Child Carer Credit (SPCCC) ](/en/money-and-tax/tax/income-
tax-credits-and-reliefs/single-person-child-carer-tax-credit/) is a tax credit
for people who are caring for children on their own. It came into effect on 1
January 2014. It replaced the One-Parent Family Tax Credit.

If you are widowed or a surviving civil partner, you can claim an increased
personal tax credit. The amount of the tax credit depends on whether or not
you have dependent children and when your spouse or civil partner died. You
can find out more about [ tax in the year of death and the years following a
death ](/en/money-and-tax/tax/income-tax-credits-and-reliefs/income-tax-
credits-and-reliefs-following-a-death/) .

The Revenue Commissioners have information on the [ tax treatment of widowed
people and surviving civil partners ](https://www.revenue.ie/en/life-events-
and-personal-circumstances/death-and-bereavement/widowed-person-or-surviving-
civil-partner/index.aspx) . Surviving civil partners are treated the same as
widows or widowers for tax purposes.
