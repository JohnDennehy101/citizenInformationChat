##  What is noise pollution?

Noise pollution can come from different sources, and can be broadly defined as
noise which:

  * Is considered a nuisance 
  * Is dangerous to human health 
  * Could damage property 
  * Could damage the environment 

There are no universal noise standard laws that apply in Ireland but your
local authority may refer to particular noise standards.

Noise pollution is outlined in the [ Environmental Protection Agency Act 1992
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1992/en/act/pub/0007/index.html) .
