###  Decision support agreements

The [ Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2015/act/64/enacted/en/html) provides
laws to support decision-making by adults who have difficulty in making
decisions without help. The Act also provides a statutory framework for
Advance Healthcare Directives.

If you have a [ decision support arrangement ](/en/health/legal-matters-and-
health/decision-support-arrangements/) , your decision supporter can help you
make decisions on certain matters.

An [ enduring power of attorney ](/en/death/before-a-death/power-of-attorney/)
also does not give the attorney the power to make decisions of this nature on
behalf of the person granting the power.
