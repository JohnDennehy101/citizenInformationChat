##  Giving consent

If you are an adult with capacity, there is no doubt about the need for [
consent ](/en/health/legal-matters-and-health/assisted-decision-making-
act#l26a1c) but what exactly constitutes informed consent is not totally
clear.

You may give a general consent – for example, you may tell your doctor to do
what they consider best. You may give implied consent by not specifically
ruling out certain procedures.

Your implied consent may arise out of necessity – for example, if unexpected
complications arise during an operation.

If you are seriously ill and not in a position to give or withhold consent,
the doctor may carry out what would be considered usual procedures arising
from necessity.

Sometimes doctors may consult with your family or nearest relatives but they
really have no legal right to give or withhold consent.
