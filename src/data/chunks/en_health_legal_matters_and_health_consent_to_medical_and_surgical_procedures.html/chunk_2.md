##  Introduction

As a general rule, medical or surgical procedures may not be carried out
without the informed consent of the patient.

Informed consent can be given where the patient has enough information to be
able to understand what is proposed and the potential risks and benefits. The
patient must have the capacity to make the decision and must be free to do so
without threat or pressure from others.

There are specific laws about consent in relation to the [ rights of
psychiatric patients ](/en/health/health-services/mental-health/rights-of-
psychiatric-patients/) .
