###  Unemployed

To get a jobseeker’s payment you must be unemployed for at least 4 days out of
7. This means that you can work for up to 3 days in a 7-day period and still
qualify for a jobseeker’s payment for the days you are not working. You can
also take up to [ 2 weeks’ holiday in a year ](/en/social-welfare/irish-
social-welfare-system/claiming-a-social-welfare-payment/going-abroad-and-
social-welfare-payments/) and continue to get your payment.

If you work 36 hours or more in a week, you will be treated as being in full-
time employment. However, people who work a lower number of hours (perhaps as
low as 30 hours, depending on the job) in a week may also be treated as being
in full-time employment. People in full-time employment do not qualify for a
jobseeker’s payment.
