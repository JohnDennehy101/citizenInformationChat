###  Part-time work

If you can only find part-time work or if your employer reduces your days at
work to 3 days a week or less, you may get a jobseeker’s payment for the other
days. You must meet the other conditions that apply to the payment, for
example, you must continue to look for full-time work. In the case of
Jobseeker’s Allowance, any income from work is assessed in the means test.
