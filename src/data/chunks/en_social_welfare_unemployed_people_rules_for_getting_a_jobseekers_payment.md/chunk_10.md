###  Available for work

You are considered available for work if:

  * You state that you are available for work 
  * You do all that is asked to show compliance with this availability condition 
  * There is no evidence you are not available for work 

The Department of Social Protection considers that you are available for work
if you are prepared to accept any offers of suitable employment immediately.
In addition, the employment must be suitable, having regard to your age, sex,
physique, education, normal occupation, where you live, rate of pay offered
and your family circumstances.

However, you can be regarded as not being available for work and therefore not
entitled to a jobseeker’s payment if you put unreasonable restrictions on the
following:

  * The nature of the employment 
  * The hours of work 
  * The rate of pay 
  * The duration of the employment 
  * The location of the employment 

If a Deciding Officer thinks that you have placed unreasonable restrictions,
you will be interviewed and given the opportunity to respond. Note that if you
refuse a suitable offer of work, you can be disqualified from a jobseeker’s
payment.

For example, you are considered unavailable for work in the following
circumstances:

  * You are looking for a particular type of work only. 
  * You state that you are looking for part-time work only. However, if you cannot get suitable full-time employment, you can still accept part-time work. 
  * You are only available during hours which are not typical of the employment you are looking for, for example, looking for clerical office work in evenings only. 
  * You are unwilling to take up an offer of reasonable short-time employment, for example, relief work or employment under a short-term contract. 
  * You move to a location where your prospects of getting suitable employment are significantly reduced. However, the reasons for the move will be taken into account. 
  * You are placing unreasonable restrictions on the distance which you are willing to travel to find work. However, access to public and private transport is taken into account. 
  * You may also be asked about your responsibilities at home, for example, who is looking after your child dependents. This question must be asked all applicants. 

If you are looking after a sick or older person and are not available for work
you may be entitled to a [ carer’s payment ](/en/social-
welfare/carers/payments-to-carers/) .
