###  On strike

If you are on strike, you are not considered unemployed and will not get a
jobseeker’s payment. However, if you are out of work as a result of a strike
(for example, you have been laid off because of the strike), you may get a
jobseeker’s payment. You may get a jobseeker’s payment if you are "not
participating in or directly interested in the trade dispute which caused the
stoppage at work". If you are on strike, your family may get [ basic
Supplementary Welfare Allowance ](/en/social-welfare/supplementary-welfare-
schemes/supplementary-welfare-allow/) .
