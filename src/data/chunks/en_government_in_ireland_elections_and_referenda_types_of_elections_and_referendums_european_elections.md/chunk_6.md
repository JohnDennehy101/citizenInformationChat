##  How are MEPs replaced?

There are no by-elections for the European Parliament. If an MEP dies or
resigns, the vacancy is filled from a replacement list. Before the close of
European election nominations, each registered political party or independent
candidate may submit a list of up to 6 replacement candidates to the returning
officer.

If an MEP dies or resigns, the person who is at the top of his or her
replacement list and is willing to become an MEP fills the vacancy.
