####  Jobseeker's Allowance (JA)

If you have used up your entitlement to JB or you are not entitled to JB
because you do not have enough PRSI contributions, you can apply for [
Jobseeker's Allowance (JA) ](/en/social-welfare/unemployed-people/jobseekers-
allowance/) if you are under 66. You must, among other things, be unemployed,
be capable of, available for and actively seeking work and pass a means test.

In general, if you have a reasonable level of pension from a former employer,
you are unlikely to qualify for JA.
