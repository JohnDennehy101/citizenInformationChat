###  Credits

You get [ social insurance credits ](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-
system/social-insurance-prsi/credited-social-insurance-contributions/) while
getting Jobseeker's Benefit and Jobseeker's Allowance. So, if you are getting
one of these benefits up to age 65 or 66, you do not need to do anything else
to maintain your social insurance record.

If you do not qualify for Jobseeker's Allowance because you do not pass the
means test, you can sign on for credits. Usually, you are allowed sign on once
a month.

If you do not qualify for Jobseeker's Benefit or Jobseeker's Allowance because
you are considered to be unavailable for work, you may not be able to sign on
for credits either. If this is the case or if, for example, you want to spend
all or part of your retirement abroad, you can become a voluntary contributor
to social insurance. You should apply to the Department of Social Protection
to become [ a voluntary contributor ](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-
system/social-insurance-prsi/voluntary-prsi-contributions/) within a year of
retirement.
