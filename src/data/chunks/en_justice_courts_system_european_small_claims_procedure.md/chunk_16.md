###  Defendant admits the claim

The defendant admits the claim and agrees to pay you the amount claimed by one
of the following methods:

  * Immediate payment to the preferred bank account indicated on your initial claim form 
  * A deferred lump sum, payable on a specified date 
  * Instalment payments at intervals to be agreed with you 

The Registrar will state the defendantâ€™s preferred option and seek your
consent to resolve the matter in this way.

The defendant may also admit the claim but the dispute the amount claimed for.
The Registrar will inform you of this and attempt to negotiate a solution
between you and the defendant. If this fails, the claim is referred to the
District Court for judgment.
