####  Jurisdiction section

In the _Jurisdiction_ section, you must indicate the legal grounds which you
believe the District Court has to deal with this claim. The possible grounds
are listed and you choose the most relevant option.

For example, you may choose ‘domicile of the consumer’ because the District
Court is in Ireland, which is your permanent home.
