##  Enforcing your judgment

Enforcing a judgment is governed by the law of the EU member state where the
judgment will be enforced. If the defendant is based in another EU member
state, the judgment will be enforced there.

The rules for enforcing a judgment may be different in each country. You can
find [ information about enforcement procedures
](https://e-justice.europa.eu/42/EN/small_claims) in other EU member states on
the European e-Justice Portal.

To enforce the judgment, you must:

  * Provide an original copy of the judgment and the certificate of judgment to the court in the member state 
  * Provide a translation of these documents into the member state's official language 

You are not required to provide any security, bond or deposit on the grounds
that you are a foreign national or are not living in that member state.

If the judgment conflicts with an earlier judgment made on the same matter,
the defendant can request that the court refuse to enforce the judgment. This
must not have been previously raised during the procedure, and the earlier
judgment must have been given in the member state, or was capable of being
recognised there.
