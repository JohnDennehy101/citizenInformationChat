###  What is not covered by the procedure?

The procedure does not apply to:

  * Revenue, customs or administrative matters 
  * Social security 
  * The liability of the State 
  * The status or legal capacity of an individual 
  * Violations of privacy or personality rights, including defamation 
  * Employment law 
  * Bankruptcy, debt settlement agreements (know as compositions), and similar proceedings 
  * Arbitration 
  * Property tenancies 
  * Property rights arising from marriage, maintenance obligations, or wills and successions 

The procedure does not cover Denmark, so you would need to use a national
procedure for Denmark if making a claim against somebody living there.
