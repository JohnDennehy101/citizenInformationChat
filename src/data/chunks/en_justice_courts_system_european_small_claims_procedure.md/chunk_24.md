##  How much does it cost to make a claim?

The fee for the European small claims procedure is â‚¬25. You can pay by:

  * Cheque 
  * Postal order 
  * Bank draft 

You may have to pay for the translation of your documents if they are in a
language the defendant does not understand.

If you win, you can claim for such additional costs. If you lose, however, you
may have to pay for any translation or other costs incurred by the defendant.
