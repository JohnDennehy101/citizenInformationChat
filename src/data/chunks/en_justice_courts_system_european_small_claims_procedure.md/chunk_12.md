##  Types of claims dealt with under the procedure

The procedure applies to cross-border cases, so you and the party you have a
dispute with must live in separate EU countries. You can make claims against
an organisation, another business, or a customer.

The procedure can be used in most types of civil or commercial claims, such as
claims for:

  * Payment of money 
  * Damages arising from an accident 
  * Delivery of goods or other moveable property 
  * Fulfilment of a contract 
  * Prevention of an illegal act
