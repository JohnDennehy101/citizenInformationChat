###  When is the judgment given?

The District Court will usually give its judgment within 30 days of receiving
one of the following:

  * The defendant’s response to the claim. 
  * Your response to a counterclaim (if one has been made). 
  * Either party’s response to a request for further information (if such a request has been made). 

The court may hold an oral hearing at the request of either party, or if it
decides that it cannot form a judgment based on the written submissions
received. This is done by video conference. The court will give its judgment
within 30 days of holding the oral hearing.

If either or both parties do not reply within 30 days, the court still gives
its judgment.

Either party can request that the court issue a certificate concerning the
judgment. The court issues this using the relevant form.
