##  What is the European small claims procedure?

The European small claims procedure provides an inexpensive way for someone to
pursue a cross-border claim without employing a [ solicitor
](/en/justice/courtroom/solicitors/) .

It is an alternative to options that may exist under the national laws of EU
member states. It is available in all EU member states except Denmark.

In Ireland, the service is facilitated by the local [ District Court
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/justice/courts-system/district-court/)
offices. To use the service, the claim cannot exceed â‚¬5,000.

The procedure was established under [ EU Regulation No. 861/2007 ](http://eur-
lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?qid=1466676798480&uri=URISERV:l16028) and
implemented in Ireland by [ SI 533 of 2008
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2008/en/si/0533.html) .
