##  The Multi-Party Agreement

The Multi-Party Agreement is an agreement between the British Government, the
Irish Government and most of the political parties in Northern Ireland. It
sets out the support of the signing parties to the terms of the British-Irish
Agreement and goes on to provide the framework for various political
institutions. It is broken into three strands:

  * Strand 1: Democratic Institutions in Northern Ireland 
  * Strand 2: North-South Institutions 
  * Strand 3: British-Irish Institutions 

It also deals with issues such as human rights, policing, decommissioning and
the release of prisoners – see ‘Other areas covered’ below.
