The Good Friday Agreement placed a renewed emphasis on human rights, in
particular, the European Convention on Human Rights which to that point had
not been [ legislated for in Ireland
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2003/act/20/enacted/en/print.html) or the
[ UK ](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1998/42/contents) . Both countries
subsequently incorporated the Convention into national law and established
human rights bodies, such as the forerunner to the current [ Irish Human
Rights and Equality Commission ](https://www.ihrec.ie/) and the [ Northern
Ireland Human Rights Commission ](http://www.nihrc.org/about-us) .

The signatory parties to the Good Friday Agreement also re-acknowledged their
commitment to decommissioning of weapons, a process which had already begun.
In addition, the British Government committed to reducing the number and role
of the Armed Forces in Northern Ireland in an attempt to return to a
normalised society. As part of this process, various security installations
were taken down.

An independent commission was also set up to report on policing arrangements
in Northern Ireland. This ultimately led to the establishment of the [ Police
Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) ](https://www.psni.police.uk/) , as a
successor to the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC), and its supervisory body,
the Northern Ireland Policing Board.

The Good Friday Agreement also committed both governments to the early release
of many prisoners associated with the Troubles on the condition that the
groups they were affiliated with stayed in a ceasefire.
