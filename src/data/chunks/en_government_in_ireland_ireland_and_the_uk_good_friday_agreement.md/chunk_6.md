###  Strand 2: North-South Institutions

The Good Friday Agreement provided for the establishment of a [ North South
Ministerial Council ](https://www.northsouthministerialcouncil.org/) where
ministers from both Ireland and Northern Ireland discuss matters of relevance
to the whole of the island.

Meetings of the Ministerial Council take different forms. It can meet as a
plenary body involving all the ministers from both jurisdictions or on a
smaller basis involving only the ministers with responsibility for a
particular policy area.

In [ 6 areas common policies
](https://www.northsouthministerialcouncil.org/areas-of-cooperation) are
agreed by the Ministerial Council, which then must be separately implemented
in each jurisdiction. These areas are:

  * Agriculture 
  * Education 
  * Environment 
  * Health 
  * Tourism 
  * Transport 

In 6 other areas, there are [ joint implementation bodies
](https://www.northsouthministerialcouncil.org/north-south-implementation-
bodies) , which operate on an all-island basis:

  * Waterways Ireland 
  * Food Safety Promotion Board 
  * Trade and Business Development Body (InterTradeIreland) 
  * Special EU Programmes Body 
  * The Language Body (consisting of Foras na Gaeilge and the Ulster Scots Agency) 
  * Foyle, Carlingford and Irish Lights Commission 

The [ North-South Inter-Parliamentary Association
](https://www.oireachtas.ie/en/inter-parliamentary-work/northsouth/) has also
been set up to facilitate discussion between [ DÃ¡il Eireann ](/en/government-
in-ireland/houses-of-the-oireachtas/dail-eireann/) and [ Seanad
](/en/government-in-ireland/houses-of-the-oireachtas/the-seanad/) members from
Ireland and MLAs from Northern Ireland.
