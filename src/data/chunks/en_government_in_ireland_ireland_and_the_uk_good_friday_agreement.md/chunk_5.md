###  Strand 1: Democratic Institutions in Northern Ireland

The Assembly and the [ Executive ](https://www.northernireland.gov.uk/) are
the main institutions of devolved government in Northern Ireland.

The [ Assembly ](http://www.niassembly.gov.uk/) is a democratically-elected
body consisting of 90 Members of the Legislative Assembly (MLAs). It sits in
Stormont. Initially, there were 108 members (6 MLAs per constituency) but this
has now been reduced to [ 5 MLAs per constituency
](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/nia/2016/29) . MLAs are elected using the [
Proportional Representation (Single Transferable Vote) ](/en/government-in-
ireland/elections-and-referenda/voting/proportional-representation/) system.

Some votes in the Assembly require cross-community support, meaning that
either

  * 50% of both designated unionists and designated nationalists must vote in favour, or 
  * 60% of those voting vote in favour, including 40% of both designated unionists and designated nationalists. 

The Executive is composed of a First Minister and Deputy First Minister and up
to ten other Ministers. It is answerable to the Assembly and is composed of
people elected to the Assembly. The First Minister is nominated by the party
with the most MLAs and the Deputy First Minister is nominated by the party
with the second-most MLAs. The Minister for Justice is elected using the
cross-community support procedure and the other Ministers are allocated using
a system which grants entitlements to ministerial roles based on the number of
seats won by political parties (the dâ€™Hondt system). Ministers must comply
with a code of conduct set out in the Good Friday Agreement at all times.

The Assembly and Executive can make laws and take decisions in the areas of
health, agriculture, finance, education, infrastructure and justice.
