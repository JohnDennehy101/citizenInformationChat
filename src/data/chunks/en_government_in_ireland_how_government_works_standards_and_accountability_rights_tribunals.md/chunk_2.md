##  Introduction

There are many tribunals in Ireland that make binding decisions about people's
rights but are not a court of law. A rights tribunal acts like a court but is
not part of the courts system. It interprets and applies the law to make
binding decisions on disputes between different parties.

Rights tribunals are established by an Act of the Oireachtas. Their purpose is
to provide a quick, informal and inexpensive alternative to the courts system
in a specific area of law (for example, employment law). Rights tribunals deal
with a wide range of disputes.
