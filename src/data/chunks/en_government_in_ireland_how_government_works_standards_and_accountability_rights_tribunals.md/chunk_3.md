##  How rights tribunals are set up

The [ legislation ](/en/government-in-ireland/houses-of-the-
oireachtas/legislation/) establishing the tribunal sets out how many members
will sit on it and if they will be lawyers, civil servants or representatives
of industry. It also sets out the powers of the tribunal and the procedures
that will be applied.

The legislation also states how a decision of the rights tribunal can be
appealed. In some cases there might be a special appeals process set out in
the legislation. For example, appeals from the Workplace Relations Commission
are made to the Labour Court.

The legislation may also state that there is no appeal to the court except by
way of [ judicial review ](/en/government-in-ireland/how-government-
works/standards-and-accountability/judicial-review-public-decisions/) in the
High Court. This means that the court will not substitute its own verdict for
the decision made by the tribunal, but will ensure that the decision was made
fairly. If the decision of the tribunal was made without following fair
procedures, it may be set aside (cancelled) by the High Court.

The State pays the cost of running a rights tribunal. Parties appearing before
a rights tribunal generally have to pay for their own legal representation.
