###  How can I make a complaint?

If you have a complaint about your parental leave entitlement, you should
first discuss this with your employer.

If you cannot resolve the issue informally, either you or the employer can
refer the complaint to the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC) **within 6
months** of the dispute or complaint occurring. The time limit can be extended
for a further 6 months, but only if there is a reasonable cause for the delay.

You can submit your complaint using [ the WRCâ€™s online complaint form
](https://www.workplacerelations.ie/en/complaints_disputes/refer_a_dispute_make_a_complaint/)
.
