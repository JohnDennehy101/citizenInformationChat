##  How much parental leave can I take?

You can take **up to 26 weeks parental leave** for each eligible child. This
is set out in the [ Parental Leave (Amendment) Act 2019

If you have more than one child, parental leave is limited to 26 weeks in a
12-month period. This can be longer if your employer agrees.
