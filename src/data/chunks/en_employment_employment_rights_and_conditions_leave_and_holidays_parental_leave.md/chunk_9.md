##  Do I have to take all my parental leave at the same time?

You are entitled to 26 weeks parental leave for each eligible child. You can
take this leave as either:

  * One continuous period of leave 
  * 2 separate blocks of at least 6 weeks each (there must be a gap of at least 10 weeks between the 2 periods of parental leave per child). 

You can break your parental leave into working days or hours (or a combination
of both) if your employer agrees to this. For example, you can ask to take one
day of parental leave a week until the entire 26-week allowance is used up.
