###  Can my employer postpone my parental leave?

Your employer can postpone your parental leave for up to 6 months. They must
do this before signing the confirmation document. After that, your leave
cannot be postponed without further written agreement.

Reasons for postponement can include:

  * Lack of cover while you are on leave 
  * The fact that other employees are already on parental leave. 

Normally parental leave may only be postponed once. However, your leave may be
postponed twice if the reason is seasonal variations in the volume of work.
