##  Returning to work after parental leave

You are entitled to return to your job after taking parental leave, unless it
is not reasonably practicable for your employer to allow you to return to the
same job.

If this is the case, you must be offered a suitably alternative job within the
business. The alternative job cannot have less favourable conditions compared
with your previous job, for example, it must have the same (or better) pay
conditions. You are also entitled to any improvements in pay or other
conditions which occurred while you were on parental leave.

Parents who take parental leave are protected from [ unfair dismissal
