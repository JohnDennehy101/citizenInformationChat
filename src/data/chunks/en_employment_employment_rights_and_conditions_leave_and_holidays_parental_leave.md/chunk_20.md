###  Can I ask for more flexible working arrangements?

When you return to work after taking parental leave, you can request changes
to your working hours or patterns. This is usually proposed for a set period
of time. Your employer must consider your request and give you a response
within 4 weeks. Your employer does not have to agree to your request.
