###  Can I share my unpaid parental leave with my partner?

Both parents have an equal, separate entitlement to parental leave. This means
you are both entitled to 26 weeks leave.

If you both work for the same employer and your employer agrees, you can
transfer 14 weeks of your parental leave entitlement to the other parent.
