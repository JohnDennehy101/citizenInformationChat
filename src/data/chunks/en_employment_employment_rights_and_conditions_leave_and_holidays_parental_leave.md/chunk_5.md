###  Age limits for children

You can take parental leave for each child up until their 12th birthday.

If you adopted your child between the age of 10 and 12, you can take parental
leave for them for up to 2 years after the date of the adoption order.

If your child has a disability or a long-term illness, you can take parental
leave until they are 16 years of age.

An extension of parental leave may be allowed if illness or another incapacity
stopped you from taking the leave before your child reached the age limit.
