##  Introduction

[ The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) ](/en/government-in-
ireland/data-protection/overview-of-general-data-protection-regulation/) came
into force across the EU on 25 May 2018.

The [ Data Protection Act 2018
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2018/act/7/enacted/en/html) , which was
signed into law on 24 May 2018, gave further effect to the GDPR in areas where
member states have flexibility (for example, the digital age of consent).

The GDPR very significantly increases the obligations and responsibilities for
organisations and businesses in how they collect, use and protect personal
data. Organisations and businesses are required to be fully transparent about
how they are using and safeguarding personal data, and to be able to
demonstrate accountability for their data processing activities.
