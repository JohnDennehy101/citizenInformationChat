###  European Data Protection Board

The GDPR introduced a new European data protection supervisory authority. The
[ European Data Protection Board (EDPB) ](https://edpb.europa.eu/about-
edpb/about-edpb_en) is responsible for ensuring the GDPR is applied
consistently across The European Union. It will issue guidelines and
recommendations on the application of the Regulation. It will also advise the
EU Commission on the application of the Regulation and any updates that may be
required.

The EDPB is made up of the head of one supervisory authority of each member
state and a European Data Protection supervisor or their representatives.
