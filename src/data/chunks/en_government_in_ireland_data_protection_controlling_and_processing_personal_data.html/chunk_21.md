###  Lesser breaches

Under the GDPR, organisations in breach of the Regulation can be fined up to
2% of their annual global turnover or â‚¬10 million, whichever is greater, for
lesser breaches. Some examples of lesser breaches include: not having records
in order, not notifying the supervisory authority and data subject about a
breach or not conducting an impact assessment.
