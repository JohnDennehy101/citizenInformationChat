##  Opening a bank account

You can open a [ basic bank account ](/en/money-and-tax/personal-
finance/banking/standard-bank-account/) if you do not have the ID and proof of
address that you need to open a current account. The Irish Banking Culture
Board has a [ Guide to Basic Bank Accounts
](https://www.irishbankingcultureboard.ie/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/basic-
bank-account-guide_UKRAINIAN_high.pdf) in Ukrainian.

Many banks have made it easier to open a bank account if you have arrived in
Ireland from Ukraine.

An Post (the Irish postal service) has [ current accounts
](https://www.anpost.com/Ukraine-Current-Account-Support) . You need photo ID
(you can use expired ID), your temporary permission letter and your PPS
number. You need proof of address:

  * A signed letter from the person you are staying with along with a household bill in their name 
  * A letter on headed paper if you are staying in temporary accommodation provided by the Irish state.
