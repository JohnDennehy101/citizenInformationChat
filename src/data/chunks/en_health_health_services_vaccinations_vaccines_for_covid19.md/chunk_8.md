####  Booking your child’s COVID-19 vaccine or booster

There are different places to get your child vaccinated, depending on their
age. [ Check the HSE website to see where to get your child’s COVID-19 booster
or vaccine. ](https://www2.hse.ie/screening-and-
vaccinations/covid-19-vaccine/get-the-vaccine/children/#if-your-child-
recently-had-a-covid-19-infection)

If you have more than one child getting a vaccine or booster dose, book an
appointment for each child. Your vaccination centre will have separate
appointment slots and walk-in clinics for different age groups.

If your child recently had COVID-19, you must delay getting the COVID-19
vaccine. You can [ check the length of wait between having COVID-19 and
booking your child's next vaccine or booster as this depends on their age
](https://www2.hse.ie/screening-and-vaccinations/covid-19-vaccine/get-the-
vaccine/children/#if-your-child-recently-had-a-covid-19-infection) .
