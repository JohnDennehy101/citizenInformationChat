###  Which COVID-19 vaccine dose or booster dose should I get?

Many of the vaccines are given in [ 2 or 3 separate doses
](https://www2.hse.ie/screening-and-vaccinations/covid-19-vaccine/vaccine-
types/#doses-and-immunity) , a few weeks apart. This is called the first round
of vaccination. You can get a booster dose after your first round of
vaccinations are complete.
