###  Main payments

If you were living with or dependent on the deceased, any current benefits or
payments you are getting may change, or you may be able to claim additional
benefits. Depending on your income and circumstances you may be entitled to a
social welfare payment in your own right, for example:

A [ Widow's, Widower's or Surviving Civil Partner's Contributory Pension
](/en/social-welfare/death-related-benefits/widowed-persons-contrib-pension/)
and related social welfare benefits may be payable if either you or your
deceased spouse or civil partner has enough PRSI contributions.

A [ Widow's, Widower's or Surviving Civil Partner's (Non-Contributory) Pension
](/en/social-welfare/death-related-benefits/widowed-persons-non-contrib-
pension/) is paid to widowed people or surviving civil partners without
dependent children, who do not qualify for a contributory pension and who pass
a means test.

A [ Guardian's payment ](/en/social-welfare/death-related-benefits/guardian-
and-orphan-payments/) is paid to the child's guardian up to the child's 18th
birthday or 22nd birthday if he or she is in full-time education.

A [ One-Parent Family Payment ](/en/social-welfare/families-and-children/one-
parent-family-payment/) can be paid to you if you are parenting alone as a
result of the death of your spouse, civil partner or cohabitant. If you also
qualify for a Widow's, Widower's or Surviving Civil Partner's Contributory
Pension you will have to choose which payment is of most benefit to you
because you cannot get both.

If a person dies because of an accident at work or occupational disease, [
Death Benefit under the Occupational Injuries Scheme ](/en/social-
welfare/death-related-benefits/death-benefits-under-oib/) may be paid to their
surviving spouse or civil partner.
