###  Exceptions to the hearsay rule

Not all out-of-court statements are hearsay. For example, if an accused claims
that they cannot speak, you can give evidence that you saw and heard them say
"I want an ice-cream". This evidence is not being introduced to prove that the
accused wanted an ice-cream, but to prove that they can speak. For that
reason, it is admissible.

The most important exception to the hearsay rule is admission or confession
evidence. Generally, it is assumed that someone would not make a statement
against their own interests, so the statement must be true. This means that
you can give evidence that the accused said to you on the day the victim died,
"I did it. I killed him". Normally, this would be hearsay evidence as it is an
out-of-court statement and it has been introduced to prove that the accused
killed the deceased. However, because confessions are an exception to the
hearsay rule, that evidence can be admitted in court.
