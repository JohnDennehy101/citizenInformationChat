###  1\. Report the problem to the customer service desk of your airline

If your luggage does not arrive at the airport (or it is damaged or
destroyed). Report the problem to the customer service desk of your airline.
Check if the airline uses an online tracking system for luggage. Do this at
the airport baggage claims hall.
