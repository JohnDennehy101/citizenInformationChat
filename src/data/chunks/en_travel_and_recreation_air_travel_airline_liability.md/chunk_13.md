###  2\. Complete a Property Irregularity Report (PIR)

You should complete a Property Irregularity Report (PIR). The PIR will include
details of your flight (for example, the airline, date, flight number and
time), your luggage, your name, and your address. You will be given a copy of
the PIR which you should keep, and the airline will keep the other copy.
