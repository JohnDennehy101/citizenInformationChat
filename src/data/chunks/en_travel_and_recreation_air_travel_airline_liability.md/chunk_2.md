##  International laws for air travel

Airlines have many responsibilities to their passengers, cargo, and luggage.
International laws provide a worldwide system of standards and rules for air
travel. These laws provide minimum liability limits for the carriage of
passengers, cargo and luggage in the event of death, injury, damage, delay or
loss. These laws were first agreed upon and introduced worldwide in 1929.
