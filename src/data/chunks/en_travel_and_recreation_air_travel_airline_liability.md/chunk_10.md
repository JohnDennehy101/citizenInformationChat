###  Travelling with non-EU airlines

The liability limits in various countries around the world can vary, this is
due to the complex nature of laws governing airline liability. In countries
that are covered by the Montreal Convention, the liability limits are the same
as for EU airlines. Whether you would be entitled to an advance payment in
case of an injury or death (and how much), depends on the law of the country.

You should get adequate travel insurance before your journey. Check the
liability limits for the airline you are travelling with beforehand.
