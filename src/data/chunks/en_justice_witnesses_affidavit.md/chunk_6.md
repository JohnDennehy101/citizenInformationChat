###  Submitting the affidavit to court

Once the affidavit has been sworn, it can then be submitted as evidence to the
court.

To do this, you lodge the affidavit with the appropriate court office and pay
the relevant fee (see ‘Affidavit fees’ below). You then send a duplicate copy
of the affidavit to the other party in the case.
