##  Swearing by video-conference

It is possible to swear affidavits for use in the Circuit Court, High Court,
Court of Appeal or Supreme Court by video-conference where the witness cannot
attend in person with the Commissioner for Oaths or practising solicitor who
is to verify the affidavit.

It may not be practicable for example due to health issues, which affect the
ability to meet in person. The reason for the inability to meet must be set
out in the affidavit.

When swearing an affidavit by video-conference:

  * The Commissioner for Oaths or practising solicitor must have a copy of the affidavit itself, any documents being attached to it (exhibits), and an identification document for the witness 
  * Both the witness and the Commissioner for Oaths or practising solicitor must be able to see and hear one another 
  * The Commissioner for Oaths or practising solicitor must confirm that an appropriate religious text is available to the witness 
  * The witness must go through every page to be included in the affidavit and make the necessary oath 
  * The _jurat_ will state that the affidavit was made by video-conference 

The affidavit is then sent to the Commissioner for Oaths or practising
solicitor who confirms compliance and countersigns the affidavit.

When swearing an affidavit in person or by video-conference, the steps
involved should be explained to you by the Commissioner for Oaths or
practising solicitor.
