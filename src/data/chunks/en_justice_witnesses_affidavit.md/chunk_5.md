##  Swearing an affidavit

When your affidavit is ready, you should go to an independent [ Commissioner
for Oaths ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/justice/civil-
law/commissioners-for-oaths/) or practising [ solicitor
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/justice/courtroom/solicitors/) who
will verify the affidavit.

Before you swear the oath, they will check that you have read the affidavit
and fully understand its contents.

You will be asked to raise an appropriate religious text to your beliefs, such
as the Bible, and to repeat the words of the oath. If you do not want to swear
an oath on the Bible, you can make an affirmation. You then sign the
affidavit.

The Commissioner for Oaths will verify that the affidavit was properly sworn
by completing and signing a _jurat_ on the affidavit.
