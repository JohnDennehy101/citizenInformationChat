##  Introduction

An affidavit is a sworn written statement from a [ witness
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/justice/witnesses/being-a-witness/) in
a case. It is a document that sets out the [ evidence
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/justice/evidence/evidence-
introduction/) that the witness wants to give. The witness who swears an
affidavit is known as a deponent.

Affidavits are sometimes written and prepared by a [ solicitor
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/justice/courtroom/solicitors/) or a [
barrister
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/justice/courtroom/barristers/) after
they get all the necessary information from the witness.

It is possible to swear affidavits for use in the [ Circuit Court
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/justice/courts-system/circuit-court/)
, [ High Court ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/justice/courts-
system/high-court/) , [ Court of Appeal
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/justice/courts-system/court-of-
appeal/) or [ Supreme Court
