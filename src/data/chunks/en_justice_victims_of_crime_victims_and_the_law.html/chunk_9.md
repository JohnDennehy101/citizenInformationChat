The [ Domestic Violence Act 2018
](https://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2018/act/6/enacted/en/html) consolidates
previous domestic violence legislation. It provides protection where there is
a violent family member.

  * [ Barring orders ](/en/birth-family-relationships/problems-in-marriages-and-other-relationships/barring-safety-and-protection-orders#l59761)

**A safety order** prohibits the violent person from further violence or
threats of violence. It does not oblige the person to leave the family home.
If the person does not live with you, it prohibits them from watching or being
near your home, or communicating with you (including electronic
communication).

**A barring order** requires the violent person to leave the family home. The
order also prohibits the person from further violence or threats of violence,
and from watching or being near your home or communicating with you (including
electronic communication).

There are [ other orders that can be put in place ](/en/birth-family-
relationships/problems-in-marriages-and-other-relationships/barring-safety-
and-protection-orders/) which are temporary.
