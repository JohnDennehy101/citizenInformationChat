###  Bail Act 1997

The [ Bail Act 1997
](https://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1997/act/16/enacted/en/html) tightened
up the [ bail ](/en/justice/arrests/bail-and-surety/) regime. A court can
refuse bail to a person charged with a serious offence if it is likely that
the person may commit another serious offence while they are on bail. In
addition, the Act requires a court to impose consecutive sentences when an
offence is committed on bail.

If [ An Garda Síochána ](/en/justice/law-enforcement/garda-siochana-national-
police-force/) suspects that somebody has or is about to breach a bail-bond,
and if they believe that person may pose a threat to a victim or witness
involved in the case, the Gardaí can arrest the person without a warrant.
