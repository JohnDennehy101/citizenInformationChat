###  Marking system for examination grades

The examination scale has 8 grades, the highest grade is Grade 1 and the
lowest grade is Grade 8.

The 8-point grading scale replaced the 14-point scale at both Higher and
Ordinary levels in 2017.

Marks between 100% and 30% are divided into seven grade bands (1-7). Each band
is 10% wide.

The scheme means that the Common Points Scale used by the CAO to determine
entry into higher education institutions was also revised in 2017. You can
read more on the Department of Educationâ€™s [ Transition website
