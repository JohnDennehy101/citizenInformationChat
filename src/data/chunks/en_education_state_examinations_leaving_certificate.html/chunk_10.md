##  Getting a copy of your old Leaving Certificate results

You may be asked for evidence that you have completed State examinations when
you apply for a job or for further education. It is always useful to have a
copy of your results as well as the original Certificate, especially if you
plan to work or study outside Ireland.

The State Examinations Commission can give you a certified [ statement of your
results ](https://www.examinations.ie/statement-of-results/) .
