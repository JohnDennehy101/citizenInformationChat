####  Supports for home-buyers

An income tax rebate, the Help-to-Buy incentive, is being introduced to help
first-time buyers of newly built homes to fund the deposit required under the
Central Bank’s rules. It also applies to once-off self-build homes. It will
consist of a rebate of income tax paid over the previous 4 years.

To qualify for the scheme, applicants must take out a mortgage of at least 80%
of the purchase price (or, for a self-build, 80% of the valuation approved by
the mortgage provider).

For new homes costing up to €400,000, a rebate of up to 5% of the purchase
price will be available. For homes costing between €400,000 and €600,000, the
maximum relief will be €20,000.

No relief will be available for homes costing more than €600,000.

This incentive will run until the end of 2019. It is intended to apply with
effect from 19 July 2016.
