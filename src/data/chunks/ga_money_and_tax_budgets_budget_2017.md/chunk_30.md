####  Supports for homeless people

The current allocation for **** homelessness **** services **** is increased
by approximately €28 million, to €98 million.

It is intended that there will be 3,000 exits from emergency accommodation in
2017 and that hotels will only be used in limited circumstances by mid-2017.

Through the expanded **Housing First** programme, it is intended that 300
people will move from homelessness into supported tenancies in Dublin and
other major urban areas.

These measures will be supported by increased funding in the areas of mental
health and addiction from the Department of Health and by additional supports
for children and families from the Department of Children, Equality,
Disability, Integration and Youth .
