##  Who can become a foster carer?

In June 2022, there were nearly 4,000 foster carers on the panel of approved
foster carers in Ireland. Any person or family can apply to Tusla to be
assessed as a foster parent or foster family. Foster carers are a diverse
group and may be single, married, in a same-sex relationship, employed,
unemployed, renting, retired, or have a disability. They may also be from
different cultures, ethnic or religious backgrounds.

A foster carer must be able to provide adequate and appropriate accommodation
for the foster child. Tusla assigns a social worker to carry out an assessment
of suitability. These assessments include meeting all members of the family
(particularly the foster parents) over a number of months. References, Garda
vetting and a willingness to attend training and ongoing learning support will
also be required as part of this process. Find out more about [ what is
