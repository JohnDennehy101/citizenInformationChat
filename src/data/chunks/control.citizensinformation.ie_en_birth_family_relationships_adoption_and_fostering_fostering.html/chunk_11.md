###  Long-term foster care

Long-term foster care involves a child being cared for by a foster family for
a number of years and may continue until the child reaches adulthood.

If foster parents, including relative foster parents, have been caring for a
child for a continuous period of at least 5 years, they may apply to the court
for an order. The order may, subject to conditions, give the foster parents
broadly the same rights as parents to make decisions about their children. For
example, they will be able to give consent for medical and psychiatric
examinations, treatment and assessments, and apply for a passport. The foster
parents must get consent from Tusla, and may also need the consent of the
parents or guardians. This is set out under Section 4 of the [ Child Care
(Amendment) Act 2007.

After a period of time, if it becomes clear that it will not be possible for
the child to be returned to their birth parents or family, it may be decided
that the childâ€™s best interests would be served by being [ adopted by the
foster parents ](https://www.tusla.ie/services/birth-information-and-tracing-
