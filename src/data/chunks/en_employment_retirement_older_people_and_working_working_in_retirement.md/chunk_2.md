##  Can I get a new job after I retire?

In general, people over the age of 65 can be employed or self-employed.

Some jobs have a _statutory upper age limit_ , for example, members of the
Garda Síochána must retire by 60. Even if you were subject to a statutory
retirement age in your previous job, you can take up a different job or self-
employment when you retire.

If you have taken early retirement, you can take up another job or become
self-employed. Many people over the "normal" retirement age of 65 continue
working past this age.

Before you decide to work in retirement, you should read about the possible
impact on your pension, social welfare payments, and tax obligations.
