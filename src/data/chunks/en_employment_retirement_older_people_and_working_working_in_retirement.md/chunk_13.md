####  Part-time or low-paid work

If you take up part-time work or low-paid work, you are still in the PRSI
system but you may not have to pay anything. If you earn less than €352 a
week, you don't have to pay PRSI. If you earn over €38, your employer has to
pay and you have full cover.

Once you step over the €352 limit, you must pay PRSI on all your income from
work. A [ PRSI credit ](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/social-
insurance-prsi/paying-social-insurance/) reduces the amount of PRSI payable
for people earning between €352.01 and €424 per week. The credit is tapered
and the amount of the credit depends on your earnings.
