##  Impact on your private sector pension

If you are getting an [ occupational pension ](/en/money-and-tax/personal-
finance/pensions/occupational-pensions/) , you can work or be self-employed.
Working or being self-employed does not usually affect private pension
schemes.

If you are employed, you may be able to continue contributing to an employment
pension scheme. While most occupational pension schemes do not accept
contributions over the age of 65, some do. You can get tax relief on your
pension contributions up to age 70.
