###  If you are over 70

You do not have to pay PRSI contributions after the age of 70, whether or not
you are employed or self-employed.

If you do not have enough contributions at age 70, you cannot add to them
after that. Unlike some occupational pension arrangements, you cannot
retrospectively pay PRSI contributions.

If you are over 70 and in employment, your employer pays a small PRSI
contribution to cover you for occupational injuries. This is called [ Class J
social insurance ](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/social-
insurance-prsi/social-insurance-classes/) .
