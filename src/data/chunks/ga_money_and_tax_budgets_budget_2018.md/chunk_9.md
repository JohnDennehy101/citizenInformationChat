####  Benefit in Kind on Electric Vehicles

A 0% benefit-in-kind (BIK) rate is being introduced for electric vehicles for
a period of 1 year. This will allow for a comprehensive review of benefit in
kind on vehicles which will inform decisions for the next Budget. Electricity
used in the workplace for charging vehicles will also be exempt from benefit-
in-kind (1 January 2018 to 31 December 2018).
