###  Income tax

The **standard rate income tax band** for all earners is increasing by €750.
This means, for example, an increase from €33,800 to €34,550 for single
individuals and from €42,800 to €43,550 for married one-earner couples
(January 2018).

The **Home Carer Tax Credit** will increase from €1,100 to €1,200 (January
2018).

The **Earned Income Tax Credit** will increase from €950 to €1,150. This is
relevant for taxpayers earning self-employed trading or professional income in
certain cases and for business owner/managers who are ineligible for a PAYE
credit on their salary income (January 2018).

**Mortgage interest relief** is being extended for remaining recipients (owner
occupiers who took out qualifying mortgages between 2004 and 2012) on a
tapered basis. 75% of the existing 2017 relief will be continued into 2018,
50% into 2019 and 25% into 2020. The relief will cease entirely from 2021\.
