####  Housing tax reliefs

**Mortgage Interest Relief** , which only applies to mortgages taken out by 31
December 2012, was due to end on 31 December 2017. It will now be retained, on
a tapered basis, for remaining recipients â€“ owner occupiers who took out
qualifying mortgages between 2004 and 2012. 75% of the existing 2017 relief
will be continued into 2018, 50% into 2019 and 25% into 2020. The relief will
cease entirely from 2021.

A gradual reduction in **Rent Tax Relief** was announced in Budget 2011. From
2018 onwards, this relief will no longer be available.
