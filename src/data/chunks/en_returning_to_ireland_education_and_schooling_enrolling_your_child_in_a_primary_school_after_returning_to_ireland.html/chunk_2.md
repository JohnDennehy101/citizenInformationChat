##  Introduction

If you are returning to Ireland with young children, you may want to enrol
them in primary school. Primary school is like ‘elementary school’ in other
countries. To enrol, your child must be at least 4 years old at the start of
the school year (September).

Generally, children start primary school in junior infants when they are 4 or
5. They continue in primary school for 8 years, and then move onto [ post-
primary school ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/returning-to-
ireland/education-and-schooling/enrolling-your-child-in-a-secondary-school-
after-returning-to-ireland/) (also called 'secondary school').

**Primary school class** |  **Average starting age range**  
---|---  
Junior infants  |  4-5   
Senior infants  |  5-6   
First class  |  6-7   
Second class  |  7-8   
Third class  |  8-9   
Fourth class  |  9-10

All children in Ireland are entitled to free primary education. Most children
attend public schools that are funded by the State.

You may be able to access pre-school education through the [ Early Childhood
Care and Education (ECCE) Scheme
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/education/pre-school-education-and-
childcare/early-childhood-care-and-education-scheme/) .
