##  Step 1: Choose a school type

Depending on where your family settles in Ireland, you may have a choice of
primary schools nearby. The schools may be public (funded by the State) or
private (fee-paying).

While all State-funded schools must follow the [ national curriculum
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/education/primary-and-post-primary-
education/going-to-primary-school/primary-school-curriculum/) , each schoolâ€™s
[ board of management or patron decides how it is run
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/education/primary-and-post-primary-
education/going-to-primary-school/ownership-of-primary-schools/) . A school
can have a particular:

  * Religious ethos (for example, Catholic or multi-denominational) 
  * Language of instruction (English or Irish) 
  * Gender (all girls, all boys, or mixed) 

Other differences can include:

  * Whether students must wear a uniform 
  * The availability of extra-curricular activities
