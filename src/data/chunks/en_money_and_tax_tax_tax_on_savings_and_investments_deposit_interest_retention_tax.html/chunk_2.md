##  Introduction

If you save an amount of money (a deposit), you may get paid an annual rate of
interest on it by your bank or financial service provider.

The interest you get is taxable. The tax is called Deposit Interest Retention
Tax (DIRT).

DIRT is charged at 33% on all interest payments. (In 2019, the rate was 35%.)

Credit union deposit interest and share dividends are subject to DIRT.
