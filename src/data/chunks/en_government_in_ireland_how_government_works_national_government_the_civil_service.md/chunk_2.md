##  Introduction

The civil service carries out the work of Government and delivers public
services. Civil servants are the permanent staff of departments of state, but
they may also work for other public bodies.

The [ Constitution of Ireland ](/en/government-in-ireland/irish-
constitution-1/constitution-introduction/) does not mention the civil service
but it is vital to the functioning of the state.

The [ Civil Service Code of Standards and Behaviour (pdf)
](https://www.sipo.ie/acts-and-codes/codes-of-conduct/civil-servants/Civil-
Service-Code-of-Standards.pdf) says that the mission of the civil service is
the achievement of an excellent service for the Government and the other
institutions of State, as well as for the public as citizens and users of
public services.
