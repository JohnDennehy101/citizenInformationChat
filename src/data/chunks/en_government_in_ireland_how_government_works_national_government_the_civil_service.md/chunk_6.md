##  Civil servants and public servants

Civil servants are the branch of the public service that works directly for
the Government in government departments or in certain state agencies which
carry out functions on behalf of the State, but which are independent of
Government. For example, those who fall work in the Central Bank of Ireland
and the Revenue Commissioners are civil servants of the State.

All civil servants are also public servants. However, the public service
covers a much broader range of professions which are paid for by the State.
This includes many teachers, doctors, nurses, garda√≠ and employees of other
agencies that provide state services to the public.
