##  Finding somewhere to live

Some students live at home while at college, but you may live too far away to
travel to college every day.

Many universities or colleges have residences for some students. These must be
registered with the Residential Tenancies Board (RTB). You can check the [
Student Specific Accommodation Register (pdf)
](https://www.rtb.ie/images/uploads/old/general/SSA_Register_April_2024.pdf)
on the RTB website.

The RTB also has information about:

  * [ Renting in college, and tips for students ](https://www.rtb.ie/registration-and-compliance/rights-and-responsibilities/renting-in-college/)
  * [ Providing student specific accommodation ](https://www.rtb.ie/registration-and-compliance/registrations/student-specific-accommodation) , including rent setting and notice periods for ending a tenancy 

If you donâ€™t find student specific accommodation, you may have to [ look for a
house or flat to rent ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/housing/renting-
a-home/looking-for-a-flat-or-house-to-rent/) . Spunout has published some
information on [ how to find student accommodation
](https://spunout.ie/life/accommodation/student-accommodation) .

Once you find a place to rent, you should be aware of [ your rights and
responsibilities as a tenant
