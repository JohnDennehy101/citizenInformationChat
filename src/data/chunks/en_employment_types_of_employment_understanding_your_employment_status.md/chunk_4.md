##  How is employment status determined?

In most cases it is clear whether a worker is employed or self-employed. It is
set out in their contract with the business.

If you are an employee you have a _‘contract of service’_ (an employment
contract).

If you are self-employed you have a _‘contract for services’_ – sometimes
called a contractor.

But sometimes the actual working relationship between a worker and business is
different in practice to what the contract says.

For example, a business might label a worker as a self-employed contractor
when the relationship is actually employee and employer. This is called bogus
or _false self-employment._
