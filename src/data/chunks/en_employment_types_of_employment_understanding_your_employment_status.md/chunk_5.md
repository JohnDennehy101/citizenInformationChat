###  Establishing employment status

There is no definition of _employed_ or _self-employed_ in Irish or EU law.

In cases where it is not clear, several factors determine your employment
status. Different guidelines apply depending on the context.

  * For tax purposes a decision-making framework is used 
  * For employment law and PRSI purposes a set of legal tests are used. 

This means that you could be, for example, an employee for tax purposes and
self-employed in respect of your employment rights and social welfare
entitlements.
