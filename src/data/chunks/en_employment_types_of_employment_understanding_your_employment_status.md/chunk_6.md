##  The decision-making framework for tax purposes

**Questions** |  **Answer/ decision** |  **Explanation**  
---|---|---  
**1.** **Work and wage bargain** Is there an agreement covering the exchange of work for pay?  |  No – there is no contract  Yes – Go to question 2  |  First, we need to confirm if there is an agreement where work is exchanged for pay.   
**2.** **Personal service** Is there an agreement to provide personal services with limited substitution?  |  No – the worker is self-employed  Yes – Go to question 3  |  Asks if the worker is restricted from hiring someone else (a "substitute”) to do the work or provide the service.   
**3.** **Control** Does the business “Control” the worker?  |  No – the worker is self-employed  Yes – Go to question 4  |  Control refers to the businesses ability, authority, or right to control what work should be done, and how, when and where it is done.   
**4.** **Factual Matrix** All the circumstances points to an employment contract  |  No – the worker is self-employed  Yes – Go to question 5  |  This step looks as all aspects of the work arrangement to decide if it resembles an employment contract.   
**5.** **Legislative context** Any law indicating this is not a contract of service  |  No – the worker is an employee  Yes – the worker is self-employed  |  Consider any laws that might affect the classification as part of the framework above, especially those protecting particular employee rights.
