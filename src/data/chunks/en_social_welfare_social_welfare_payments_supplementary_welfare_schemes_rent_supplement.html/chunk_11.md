###  Discrimination when letting residential property

Equality legislation applies to lettings and accommodation. Landlords cannot
discriminate against potential tenants on grounds of gender, civil status,
family status, sexual orientation, religion, age, disability, race, or
membership of the Traveller community.

You cannot be discriminated against when renting because you are getting Rent
Supplement, HAP or any other social welfare payment. This is known as the
“housing assistance” ground. This means landlords cannot state when
advertising accommodation that Rent Supplement (or HAP) is not accepted and
they cannot refuse to rent you accommodation because you are getting a social
welfare payment.

If you feel you have been discriminated against by a landlord or their agent,
[ you can read about making a complaint under the Equal Status Acts

discrimination/) .
