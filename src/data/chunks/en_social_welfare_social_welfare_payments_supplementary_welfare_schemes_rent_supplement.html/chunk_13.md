###  Cases where rent is over the relevant limit (including on-going reviews)

The DSP can make additional Rent Supplement payments above rent limits when
this is deemed necessary. This is done on a case-by-case basis both for people
getting Rent Supplement already and for new applicants.

Under the National Tenancy Sustainment Framework (NTSF), DSP staff may provide
additional financial support above your normal Rent Supplement if:

  * A landlord increases or sets a rent above the maximum rent limit for your area 
  * You or a member of your household need specially adapted accommodation due to a disability. 

If you are having difficulty with your Rent Supplement for any other reason,
you should contact the Community Welfare Officer (CWO) at your [ local
Community Welfare Service
](https://www.gov.ie/en/collection/cb07d7-supplementary-welfare-allowance-swa-
list-of-offices-administering-swa/) as soon as possible.

In certain limited circumstances you may make additional payments above the
rent limit yourself, provided that you have the additional income above your
standard social welfare entitlement.

The Department also has an arrangement with the housing charity [ Threshold
](https://www.threshold.ie/) to support people who are at risk of homelessness
in Dublin, Cork, Meath, Kildare, Wicklow and Galway City.
