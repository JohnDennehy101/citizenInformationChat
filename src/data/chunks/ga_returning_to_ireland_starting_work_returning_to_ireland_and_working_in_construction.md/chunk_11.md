rights-and-conditions/industrial-relations-and-trade-unions/trade-unions/)
represent and protect the rights and interests of their members. There are
several trade unions in the Irish construction industry, and you have a

employee wages and other conditions of employment.

umbrella organisation for trade unions, representing a range of interests of
ICTU members, both in Ireland and Northern Ireland. ICTU has information if
