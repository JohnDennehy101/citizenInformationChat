###  Example 1:

  * Paul is on a high-protein, high-calorie diet and is getting a One-Parent Family Payment. The Department of Social Protection has set the cost of this diet at €71.43. Take one-third of his social welfare payment (excluding any amount he is getting for a child dependant) from €71.43 to get the amount of diet supplement payable. (€71.43 - €61.93 (or one-third of his One Parent Family Payment at the 2007 rate) = €9.50 paid as diet supplement) 

The rate for a married or cohabiting couple is calculated as follows: The diet
cost as set by the Department of Social Protection less one-sixth of your
social welfare payment at the **2007** rate = the diet supplement to be paid
to you.
