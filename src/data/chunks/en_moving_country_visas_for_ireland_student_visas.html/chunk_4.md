more than 3 months must register, after they arrive, with the [ local
immigration officer ](https://www.irishimmigration.ie/registering-your-
immigration-permission/how-to-register-your-immigration-permission-for-the-
first-time/) for the district in which they are living ( [ Burgh Quay
Registration Office ](https://www.irishimmigration.ie/burgh-quay-
appointments/) if living in Dublin, Cork, Kildare, Limerick, Meath or
