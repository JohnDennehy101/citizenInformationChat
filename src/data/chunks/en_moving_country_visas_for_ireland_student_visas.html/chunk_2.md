##  Travelling to Ireland to study

Citizens of certain countries who wish to pursue a course of study in Ireland
must apply for a visa to enter Ireland before they travel here. Read about [
Visa requirements for entering Ireland ](/en/moving-country/visas-for-
ireland/visa-requirements-for-entering-ireland/) .

If you are a non-EEA national coming to study in Ireland you must be enrolled
in a full-time course on the [ Interim List of Eligible Programmes (ILEP)
](https://www.irishimmigration.ie/coming-to-study-in-ireland/what-are-my-
study-options/a-third-level-course-or-a-language-course/#eligiblecourses) .
You can find out more in our page on [ the immigration rules for non-EEA
students ](/en/moving-country/moving-to-ireland/studying-in-
ireland/immigration-nonEEA-students/) .

Visa applicants must apply online for their visa - see 'How to apply'. If you
wish to study in Ireland for less than 3 months you should apply for a 'C
study visa'. If your course lasts longer than 3 months, you should apply for a
'D study visa'.

You will need to provide the following with your visa application. (Please
remember, **original documents** are required and **must be in English** or
accompanied by a notarised translation):

  * Letter of acceptance from a recognised school or college or university in Ireland confirming that you have been accepted on a course of study. This course of study must be full-time (lasting an academic year) and have a minimum of 15 hours per week study time. 
  * Evidence of your academic ability to pursue the chosen course through the English language (unless it is an English language course). 
  * Evidence that the fees for the course have been paid in full. 
  * Evidence that you have enough funds (€10,000) to maintain yourself for the initial part of your stay. 
  * Evidence that you or a sponsor have access to **at least €10,000 for each subsequent year** of your studies, in addition to the course fees for each of those years. 
  * Evidence that you have private medical insurance 
  * An explanation of any gaps in your educational history 
  * Confirmation that you intend to return to your country of permanent residence when you leave Ireland. 

Remember, the granting of a student visa to study in Ireland **does not
confer** the automatic right of anyone to join or visit you in Ireland
(whether they are a relative or not).
