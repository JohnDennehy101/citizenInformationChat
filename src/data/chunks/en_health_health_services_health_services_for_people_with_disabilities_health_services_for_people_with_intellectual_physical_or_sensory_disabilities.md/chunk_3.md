###  **Who provides health services for people with disabilities?**

You can get some services directly from the HSE. Many of the community,
residential and rehabilitative training services are provided by voluntary
organisations, which are funded by the HSE. The level of service varies
considerably throughout the country.

Your local HSE services area will have a Disability Services Manager to co-
ordinate the delivery of services to people with disabilities.
