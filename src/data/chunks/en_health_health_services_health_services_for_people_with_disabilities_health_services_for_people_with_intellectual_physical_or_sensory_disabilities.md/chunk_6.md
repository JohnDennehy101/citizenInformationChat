##  Residential care

If you have a disability and are unable to live at home, you may get
residential services directly from the HSE or, by voluntary organisations that
are funded by the HSE.

A residential service is somewhere you can live most or all of the time. You
may have to pay [ Long-Stay Contributions for Residential Support Services
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/health/health-services/health-
services-for-people-with-disabilities/long-stay-contributions/) .
