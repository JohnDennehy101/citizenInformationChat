##  How are accredited grades worked out?

An _accredited grade_ was based on the estimated mark you would have gotten in
that subject in the Leaving Certificate exam. In 2020, the term _calculated
grade_ was used.

SEC accredited grades were offered to students taking the following Leaving
Certificate programmes:

  * [ Leaving Certificate ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/education/state-examinations/leaving-certificate/) – for your subjects 
  * [ Leaving Certificate Applied (LCA) ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/education/state-examinations/leaving-certificate-applied/) – for your outstanding assessments, including your subjects, vocational specialisms and tasks due to be completed in the current LCA session 
  * [ Leaving Certificate Vocational Programme (LCVP) ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/education/state-examinations/leaving-certificate-vocational-programme/) – for your LCVP Link Modules 

There were a number of steps involved to get an accredited grade.
