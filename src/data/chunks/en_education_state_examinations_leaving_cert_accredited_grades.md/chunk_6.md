###  **Step 2:** In-school alignment by subject teachers in your school

Subject teachers in your school then reviewed the estimated percentage marks
of students in the school. Your teacher finalised their estimated percentage
marks following this [ alignment process

accredited-grades-for-leaving-certificate-2021-step-2-school-alignment-of-
marks/) .

If your school had only one teacher of a subject, that teacher would carry out
the in-school alignment process with either:

  * The deputy principal of your school, or 
  * Another teacher of the same subject in your school who did not have a Leaving Certificate class in 2021. 

Your principal must have agreed to the arrangement.
