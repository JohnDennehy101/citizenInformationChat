###  SEC accredited grade

If you appealed an accredited grade, the appeal would only check that your
school data was correctly transferred to the SEC and that it was correctly
processed by the SEC.

If you were still unhappy at the end of this process, you could get
verification of the SECâ€™s processes by independent appeal scrutineers.

**Under the accredited grades system, the estimated percentage mark provided
by the teacher could not be reviewed.**

Students who felt that their case had not been processed correctly after the
appeals process could complain to the [ Ombudsman ](https://www.ombudsman.ie/)
or, in the case of students under 18 years of age, the [ Ombudsman for
Children ](https://www.oco.ie/) .
