###  **Tertiary education programme**

A new pathway to a degree is through the [ Tertiary education programme
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/education/third-level-
education/applying-to-college/tertiary-education-programme/) . You do not
apply through the CAO and you do not need the same Leaving Certificate points.
You start your degree programme in a further education college and finish it
in a higher education (third level) college or university.

Alternatively, you can apply for [ Post-Leaving Certificate (PLC) courses
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/education/further-education-and-
training/post-leaving-certificate-courses/) directly to the individual
colleges. You donâ€™t apply through the CAO.
