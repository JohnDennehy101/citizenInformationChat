###  Split-year treatment when you return to Ireland

If you are going to be resident in Ireland for the next calendar year, you can
request split-year treatment the year you arrive.

Split-year treatment means that you are treated as resident in Ireland from
the date you arrive. This means all your employment income from that date is
taxed in Ireland in the normal way. Any employment income earned outside
Ireland before this date is not taxable in Ireland.

If you apply for split-year relief, you can claim the full yearâ€™s tax
allowances, credits and rate bands in the same way as an Irish resident, even
though you are only liable for Irish tax from the date you become resident in
Ireland.

Split-year treatment applies to employment income only.

You can apply for split-year treatment in writing:

  * Through MyEnquiries in [ myAccount on the Revenue website ](https://www.ros.ie/myaccount-web/sign_in.html?execution=e2s1&lang=en) , or 
  * To your local [ Revenue office ](https://www.revenue.ie/en/contact-us/index.aspx)

You cannot get split-year treatment if you have lived abroad for less than a
complete tax year before coming back to Ireland.
