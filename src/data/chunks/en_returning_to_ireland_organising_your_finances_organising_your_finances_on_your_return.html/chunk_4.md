##  Tax residence and domicile

Your [ tax residence and domicile ](/en/money-and-tax/tax/moving-country-and-
taxation/tax-residence-and-domicile-in-ireland/) are taken into account for a
number of taxes in Ireland.

Your tax residence depends on the amount of days you spend in Ireland in a tax
year. Staying for 183 days or more in Ireland in the tax year automatically
makes you a tax resident of Ireland. If you return to Ireland and plan on
staying permanently, Ireland is your domicile (home) for tax purposes.

If you are resident and domiciled in Ireland for tax purposes, you must pay
tax in Ireland on all of your income, including income from abroad. However,
If your income is taxable in Ireland and in a country with which Ireland has a
double taxation agreement, you do not pay tax in both countries on the same
income. See ‘Double taxation agreement’ below.

Some taxes you may have to pay in Ireland include:

  * [ Income tax ](/en/money-and-tax/tax/income-tax/how-your-tax-is-calculated/)
  * [ Deposit Interest Retention Tax (DIRT) ](/en/money-and-tax/tax/tax-on-savings-and-investments/deposit-interest-retention-tax/)
  * [ Gift tax ](/en/money-and-tax/tax/capital-taxes/capital-acquisitions-tax/)
  * [ Inheritance tax ](/en/money-and-tax/tax/capital-taxes/capital-acquisitions-tax/)
  * [ Capital Gains Tax ](/en/money-and-tax/tax/capital-taxes/capital-gains-tax/)
