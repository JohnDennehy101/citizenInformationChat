##  Do I have to pay tax if I transfer my savings to Ireland?

If you have savings from income you earned abroad when you were **non-tax
resident** in Ireland, you can transfer these savings to Ireland without
having to pay Irish tax. If you were tax resident in Ireland when you earned
your foreign income, you may have to pay tax if you transfer these savings to
Ireland.
