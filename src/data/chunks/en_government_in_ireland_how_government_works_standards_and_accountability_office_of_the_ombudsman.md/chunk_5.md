##  How are complaints to the Ombudsman investigated?

The Ombudsman first decides if they can handle your complaint. If they can,
they begin a preliminary investigation and ask the public service body to
provide relevant information. You may also be informally interviewed at this
stage.

Once the information has been gathered, the Ombudsman decides whether a formal
investigation is required.

In a formal investigation, the Ombudsman drafts a statement of complaint in
consultation with you. The investigation is carried out in private and usually
in writing. The Ombudsman may demand any information, files or documents to
help them carry out the investigation. At the end of the investigation
process, the Ombudsman must inform you of their decision

Depending on the outcome, they may ask the provider to change its decision or
offer an explanation, compensation or both. The Ombudsman can only make
recommendations. Their decisions are not legally binding.
