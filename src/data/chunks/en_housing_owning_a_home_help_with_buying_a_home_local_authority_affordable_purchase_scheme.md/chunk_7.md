###  Property

You must be a first-time buyer or ‘fresh start’ applicant.

**You are a first-time buyer if:**

  * You have not previously bought or built a property to live in. 
  * You do not own or have an interest in any property in Ireland or abroad. 

**Note:** You may be eligible if the home you have an interest in is no longer
suitable for your household.

**You are a ‘fresh start’ applicant if you previously owned a home, but you no
longer have a financial interest in it because:**

  * You are now divorced, separated, or your relationship has ended 
  * You have gone through personal insolvency or bankruptcy 

The scheme only applies to properties that are bought as your home. You must
live in it as your normal place of residence.
