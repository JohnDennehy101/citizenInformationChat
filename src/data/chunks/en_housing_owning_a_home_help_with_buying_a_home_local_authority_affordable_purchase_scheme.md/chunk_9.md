##  How much will my new home cost?

The price you pay for your new home and the equity share the local authority
takes in it are calculated by the local authority. This calculation takes into
account your maximum mortgage capacity and the minimum price set for the home
by the local authority. These calculations are done in accordance with [
regulations ](https://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2023/si/21/made/en/print) .
The maximum equity share the local authority will take in your home is 40% and
the minimum is 5%.

You can get a mortgage from a bank or financial institution for your stake in
the home. The [ Local Authority Home Loan ](/en/housing/owning-a-home/help-
with-buying-a-home/local-authority-mortgages/) and the [ Help to Buy Scheme
](/en/housing/owning-a-home/help-with-buying-a-home/help-to-buy-scheme/) may
also be available.
