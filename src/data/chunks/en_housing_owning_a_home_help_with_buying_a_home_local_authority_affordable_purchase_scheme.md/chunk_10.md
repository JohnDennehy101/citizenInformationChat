##  How do I apply for the Local Authority Affordable Purchase Scheme?

Each local authority introduces its own affordable housing scheme and manages
the application process. When homes are available under the scheme they will
be advertised on the local authority's website and in a local newspaper.

The advertisement will include details about the scheme including how and when
to apply. You apply for affordable homes as they become available and are
advertised, there is no central application system. You can also find a list
of [ available properties ](https://affordablehomes.ie/buy/properties/) on the
[ Affordable Homes website ](https://affordablehomes.ie/) .

In most cases, you will apply online where you will input your information and
upload any additional documentation. In the application, you will need to:

  * Provide your personal information, such as, your name, date of birth and PPS number 
  * Confirm you are a first-time buyer or a fresh-start applicant 
  * Provide proof of your gross annual income 
  * Provide evidence of a deposit and any savings, for example, bank statements 
  * Provide evidence of how you are going to pay for the home, for example, mortgage approval in principle or a mortgage calculator 
  * Provide proof of your right to live to Ireland 

You should apply for homes that you can afford with the scheme and that suit
the size of your household. You must submit your application by the closing
date for the scheme.
