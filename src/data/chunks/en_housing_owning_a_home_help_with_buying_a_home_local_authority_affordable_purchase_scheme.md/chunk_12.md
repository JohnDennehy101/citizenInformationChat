###  What happens if my application for an affordable home is successful?

If your application is successful, you will get an offer letter from the local
authority. Your information will be given to the developer, and you will be
invited to visit the site and choose your home. You may need to pay a booking
deposit at this point to secure the home. You will need to get a solicitor to
do the legal work involved in buying your affordable home.

You will have a contract with the local authority, which sets out the rules
about the equity share they have in your home. This contract is called an
Affordable Dwelling Purchase Arrangement. You will sign this contract before
or at the same time as you sign your standard contract of sale with the
developer.
