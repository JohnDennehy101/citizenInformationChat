##  Can I buy back the local authority’sequity share in my home?

You must buy back the local authority’s equity share in your home after 40
years. But, you can buy it back before then and you can make repayments at any
time. You can buy back the full equity share in one payment or pay it back
partially as you can afford to. However, the minimum repayment is €10,000.

If you decide to sell your home, you must pay off the equity share in your
home. If you die, the equity share must also be paid off.

The equity share in your home is a percentage of the market value of your
home. So, if property prices increase, the amount you have to pay back will
increase. For example, if you bought your property in 2023 for €380,000 and
the local authority provided equity of 20% or €76,000 and you want to buy back
the equity share in 2025 when the property is valued at €400,000, you will
have to pay 20% of this, which is €80,000.
