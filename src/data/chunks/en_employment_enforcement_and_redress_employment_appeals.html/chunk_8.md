###  If your employer does not comply

If the employer does not implement the Labour Courtâ€™s decision within 42 days,
you can apply to the District Court for an order directing the employer to do
so. The Workplace Relations Commission or your trade union or another
_excepted body_ can also apply to the District Court for an order on your
behalf. An excepted body is a body that represents the interests of a
particular group of workers (for example, an internal employee forum that
negotiates terms of employment with an employer).

The District Court must grant the order. If you are due compensation, the
District Court can also order that interest is paid.
