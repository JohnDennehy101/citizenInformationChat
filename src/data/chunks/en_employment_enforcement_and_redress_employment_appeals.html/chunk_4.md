##  Going to the hearing

You do not have to be represented at the Labour Court.

If you want to, you can be accompanied and represented at the hearing by:

  * A trade union official 
  * An official of a body which represents the interests of employers 
  * A practising barrister or practising solicitor 
  * A parent or guardian, if you are under 18 (as well as one of the people already listed) 
  * Any other person with the permission of the Labour Court 

If you do not have a representative to present your case, the Labour Court
will make sure that you are not at a disadvantage as a result.
