###  Do these notification requirements apply to persons convicted outside the
state?

Yes they do. If you are convicted of a drug trafficking offence outside
Ireland where that offence would constitute a drug trafficking offence in
Ireland, you are subject to the same Garda notification requirements if you
subsequently come to live in Ireland. If you fail to notify the Gardaí of your
details, then the Gardaí can prosecute you for non-compliance or failure to
comply with the requirements. The Gardaí, however, have to produce a document
to the court proving the particulars of your conviction abroad.
