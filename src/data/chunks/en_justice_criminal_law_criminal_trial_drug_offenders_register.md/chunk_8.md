##  Offenders under 18

Those under 18 years at time of sentencing are also obliged to notify the
Gardaí – but the periods are shorter. They are as follows:

  * 6 years: if you were imprisoned for life 
  * 3.5 years: if you were imprisoned more than 10 years (but not imprisonment for life) 
  * 2.5 years: if you were imprisoned for more than 5 years (but not more than 10 years) 
  * 1.5 years: if you were imprisoned for more than one year (but not more than 5 years) 
  * 6months: if your imprisonment is suspended by the court
