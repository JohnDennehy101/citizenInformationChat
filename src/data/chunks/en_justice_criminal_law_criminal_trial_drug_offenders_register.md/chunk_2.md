##  Introduction

Part 9 of the [ Criminal Justice Act 2006
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2006/en/act/pub/0026/index.html) came into
force in October 2006 and introduced new obligations on those who have been
convicted of [ drug trafficking offences ](/en/justice/criminal-law/criminal-
offences/drug-offences/) to notify Gardaí of certain information about
themselves. This provision is based on the same principle as the [ Sex
Offenders Register ](/en/justice/criminal-law/criminal-trial/sex-offenders-
register/) and enables the movements of convicted drug dealers to be recorded
in a similar fashion. Furthermore, the Register assists the Gardaí in
monitoring illegal activity and provides useful intelligence on convicted
offenders.

This document sets out the duties of offenders to notify the Gardaí.
Information on penalties for those who fail to comply is also provided.
