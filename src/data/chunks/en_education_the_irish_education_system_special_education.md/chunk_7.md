Each mainstream school is [ allocated a number of special education teachers
](https://ncse.ie/set-hours-and-sna-allocations) based on:

  * The size of the school, and 
  * Its educational profile

special educational needs can be enrolled into schools and access additional
supports. This lets a school be inclusive and create additional teaching
support for students who need it.
