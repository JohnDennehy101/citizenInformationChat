##  Senior Cycle programme

After completing the [ Junior Cycle ](/en/education/primary-and-post-primary-
education/going-to-post-primary-school/junior-cycle/) students begin the
Senior Cycle programme. The Senior Cycle generally caters for students from 15
to 18 although the Leaving Certificate is not limited to second-level
students. The main programmes that students can follow at Senior Cycle are:

  * [ The Transition Year ](/en/education/primary-and-post-primary-education/going-to-post-primary-school/transition-year/)
  * [ The Established Leaving Certificate ](/en/education/state-examinations/leaving-certificate/)
  * [ The Leaving Certificate Applied ](/en/education/state-examinations/leaving-certificate-applied/)
  * [ The Leaving Certificate Vocational Programme. ](/en/education/state-examinations/leaving-certificate-vocational-programme/)

Not all of these programmes are followed in every school. You must find out
what is available in your school or the school you are thinking of attending.
