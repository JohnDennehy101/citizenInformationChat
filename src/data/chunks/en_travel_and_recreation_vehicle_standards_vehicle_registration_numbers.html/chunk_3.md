##  Rules for car registration plates

The rules dealing with vehicle registration plates can be found in [ SI 318/92
Vehicle Registration and Taxation Regulations 1992
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1992/en/si/0318.html) , as amended. This law
outlines the format, dimensions and technical specifications that must be
displayed on registered vehicles.

The main requirements on the format of vehicle registration plates are:

  * The registration number, which consists of numbers and letters, must be in black on a white reflective background. 
  * The name of the county of registration must be in Irish, (for example, Baile √Åtha Cliath). 
  * The EU flag and the letters "IRL" must be placed on the left-hand side of the plate. The flag shows 12 gold stars in a circle, with the letters "IRL" in white underneath it, all on a blue reflective background. 
  * No other numbers, letters, or marks, should appear on your registration plate. 

There have been 2 registration periods every year. These registration plates
have a separate 3-digit year identifier for the first and second 6-month
period of the year, for example, 241 and 242 respectively.

Vehicle registration plates must be fixed to the front and rear of your
vehicle and be clearly visible at all times. If you tow a trailer or caravan,
a duplicate of the registration plate must be fixed to the back of the trailer
or caravan.

Vehicles with only 1 front wheel (motorcycles) only need a registration plate
on the rear of the vehicle.
