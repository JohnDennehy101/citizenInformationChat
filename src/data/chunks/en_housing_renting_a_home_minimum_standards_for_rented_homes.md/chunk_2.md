##  Introduction

Your landlord must make sure that your rented home meets certain minimum
standards. This is a legal requirement.

These standards are set out in the [ Housing (Standards for Rented Houses)
Regulations 2019
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2019/si/137/made/en/print) . In general,
the standards apply to homes rented out by private landlords.

Not all standards apply to homes let:

  * By [ local authorities ](/en/housing/local-authority-and-social-housing/applying-for-local-authority-housing/)
  * By [ approved housing bodies ](/en/housing/local-authority-and-social-housing/approved-housing-bodies/) (AHBs) 
  * For a minimum lease period of 10 years under a tenancy agreement 

They do **not** apply to communal housing being let by the HSE or an approved
housing body.

You can read more about these standards in the Government's [ Guidelines for
Housing Authorities in Implementation of Standards in Rented Accommodation
