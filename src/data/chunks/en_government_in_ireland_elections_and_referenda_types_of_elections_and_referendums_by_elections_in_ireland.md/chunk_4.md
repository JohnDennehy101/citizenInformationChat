##  Seanad bye-elections

If a senator dies or resigns, [ the Seanad ](/en/government-in-ireland/houses-
of-the-oireachtas/the-seanad/) passes a motion directing the Clerk of Seanad
Eireann to notify the Minister for Local Government that a seat has been
vacated.

The Minister must make an order directing that a bye-election be held to fill
the vacated seat. This must be done within 180 days. Nomination of candidates
and voting is the same as in a Seanad election. The bye-election is held only
in respect of the [ relevant panel
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/government_in_ireland/national_government/houses_of_the_oireachtas/the_seanad.html#l9d8b9)
