##  Introduction

A bye-election is an election to fill a seat that has been vacated in between
general or Seanad elections.

If an elected member of the Dáil or the Seanad dies, resigns or retires, their
seat is filled in a bye-election unless it is only a short time until the next
general election.

Candidates from political parties and independents can contest a bye-election.
Usually, only one person is elected, unless more than one seat in the
constituency has been vacated.

The European Parliament does not operate a bye-election system. Candidates
submit a replacement list before the election, which is used to fill their
seat if it is vacated. Normally, the candidates on the replacement list come
from the same political party or background. If no replacement candidates list
was presented in respect of the MEP who won the seat at the election or it is
not possible to fill the vacancy from the relevant list, the Dáil may select a
person to fill the vacancy from any replacement candidates list presented for
that constituency at the election.

Where a local councillor resigns, retires or dies, their party nominates a
replacement candidate. If an independent councillor dies, the local authority
follows its own procedures as set out in its standing orders.
