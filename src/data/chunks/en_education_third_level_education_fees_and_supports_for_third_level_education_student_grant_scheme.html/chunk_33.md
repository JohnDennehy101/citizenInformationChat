###  Further appeals

If you have received an appeals decision letter from a SUSI appeals officer
and you are not satisfied with the decision, you can make a further appeal to
the Student Grants Appeals Board.

You should submit your appeal online to the [ Student Grants Appeals Board
](https://www.studentgrantappeals.ie/) . Your appeal must be submitted within
30 days from the date of the letter from the appeals officer in SUSI.

You can only appeal to the Student Grants Appeals Board after you have

decision.
