####  Renewals

If you successfully applied under last year's scheme and you are still a
protection applicant, you can renew your application. SUSI will email you a
renewal form or you can [ download and complete the application form (pdf)

If you got your status during the last year, you no longer qualify for the
International Protection Student Scheme, but you may qualify for the Student
