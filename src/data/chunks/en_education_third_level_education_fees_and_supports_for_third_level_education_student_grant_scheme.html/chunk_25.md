####  2\. The distance you normally live from the college you’re going to
attend

If you normally live 30 kilometres or less from your college, you get the
‘adjacent rate’.

If you live further away than 30 kilometres, you get the ‘non-adjacent rate’.

This is based on the distance of where you ordinarily lived in the year before
you started college.
