##  Introduction

[ The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) ](/en/government-in-
ireland/data-protection/overview-of-general-data-protection-regulation/) came
into force across the EU on 25 May 2018. This regulation significantly
increases employers' obligations and responsibilities in relation to how they
collect, use and protect personal data.

Employees must understand their responsibilities under data protection law and
employers need to have adequate data protection policies and procedures in
place. It is important that organisations tell their employees about GDPR and
provide training on the new regulation.

This page gives an overview of some of the main obligations for employers and
outlines the rights of employees.
