####  **How do I get a PPS number for a person who has died?**

Sometimes, a PPS number may be needed for a person who has died, usually when
dealing with grant of probate.

In these cases, you should send a copy of the death certificate and details
about why you need the PPS number to the DSP's Client Identity Services (see
contact details below).
