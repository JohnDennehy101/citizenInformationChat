###  **I have the same PPS number as my husband**

If your PPS number is the same as your husbandâ€™s PPS number, but the last
letter is W, you must get a new PPS number in the following circumstances:

  * Your spouse is deceased 
  * You are divorced or separated 
  * You were issued with a Social Insurance number before 1979 

You can contact Client Identity Services in the Department of Social
Protection (see contact details below) for help. Read more about the [ phasing
out of W Numbers ](https://www.gov.ie/en/policy-information/84e306-pps-number-
