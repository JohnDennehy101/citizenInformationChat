####  If you change your address

If you have your PPS number and a verified MyGovID then you can update your
address using MyWelfare.ie.

If you change your address and you don't have a verified MyGovID, you should
write to the DSP giving your name, PPS number, old and new address, and proof
of your new address (such as a utility bill). The Department of Social
Protection (DSP) will then update your record.

You can scan your completed forms, and email or post them to Client Identity
Services (see address below).
