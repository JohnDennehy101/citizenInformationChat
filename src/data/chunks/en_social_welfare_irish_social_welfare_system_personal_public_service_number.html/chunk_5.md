##  Using my PPS number

You need your PPS number to use certain public services. Only [ certain
services are allowed to ask for your PPS number
](https://www.gov.ie/en/collection/4bc1b4-personal-public-service-number-
register-of-users/) .

For example, if you are starting work, you need a PPS number to register with
the Revenue Commissioners. However, when you are looking for work, employers
should not ask for your PPS number when recruiting. An employer should only
ask for your PPS number when you are actually taking up employment with the
company.

You can use your PPS number for:

  * All social welfare services 
  * The [ Free Travel Pass ](/en/social-welfare/extra-social-welfare-benefits/free-travel/)
  * Pupil ID 
  * [ Public health services ](/en/health/health-system/entitlement-to-public-health-services/) , including the [ medical card ](/en/health/medical-cards-and-gp-visit-cards/medical-card/) and the [ Drugs Payment Scheme ](/en/health/drugs-and-medicines/drugs-payment-scheme/)
  * [ Child immunisation ](/en/health/health-services/children-s-health/vaccinations-for-children/)
  * Schemes run by the Revenue Commissioners, such as [ mortgage interest relief ](/en/housing/owning-a-home/buying-a-home/mortgage-interest-relief/)
  * [ Housing grants ](/en/housing/housing-grants-and-schemes/)
  * [ Driver theory testing ](/en/travel-and-recreation/motoring/driving-tests/driver-theory-test/) and [ driving licences ](/en/travel-and-recreation/motoring/driver-licensing/full-driving-licence/)

If you are unsure whether a particular organisation, person or agent is
allowed to ask for (or use) your PPS number, contact Client Identity Services
in the Department of Social Protection (see contact details below).
