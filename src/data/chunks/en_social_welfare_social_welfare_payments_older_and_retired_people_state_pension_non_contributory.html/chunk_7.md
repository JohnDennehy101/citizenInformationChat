####  **Maintenance payments**

The DSP looks at maintenance paid to you (for example, spousal maintenance).

From 7 June 2024, child maintenance payments are not assessed in the means
test for State Pension (Non-Contributory).

If you show proof of rent or mortgage costs, the DSP will _disregard_ (not
take into account) up to â‚¬95.23 per week of your maintenance payments.

Only half of your remaining assessable maintenance is taken into account.
