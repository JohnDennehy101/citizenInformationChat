###  **When will I get my payment?**

The State Pension (Non-Contributory) is paid every Friday.

You can choose to either:

  * Be paid directly into your bank account 
  * Collect it from your local post office using your [ Public Services Card ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/public-services-card/)
