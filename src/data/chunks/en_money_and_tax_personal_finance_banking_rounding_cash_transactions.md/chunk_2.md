##  Introduction

Rounding was introduced for cash transactions in Ireland in 2015. Rounding
means that the total amount of a bill will be rounded up or down to the
nearest 5 cent.

It applies only to cash payments and does not apply to bills paid
electronically, for example, by debit card, credit card or by store card.

Rounding aims to reduce the need for 1 and 2 cent coins which cost more to
produce than they are worth. However, 1 and 2 cent coins will continue to be
legal tender.

Rounding is voluntary for retailers and customers. The retailer can apply
rounding automatically without asking you but you can choose not to have
rounding applied and use exact change.
