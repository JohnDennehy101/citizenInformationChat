####  Can both parents claim a Single Person Child Carer Credit?

Only one credit for any qualifying child is available to the primary claimant.
If you have more than one qualifying child, you can only get one Single Person
Child Carer Credit for those children.

However, if you have more than one qualifying child and you surrender your
entitlement to the SPCCC, then 2 or more secondary claimants can claim the
credit if they each care for a qualified child for more than 100 days in a
year.

For example, Jack has 2 children, Susan and Joan, and is a qualifying primary
claimant. Susan lives with her mother Mary for more than 100 days in a year
and Joan lives with her mother Denise for more than 100 days in a year. If
Jack surrenders his entitlement to the SPCCC, Mary and Denise can each claim a
SPCCC if they meet the other requirements.
