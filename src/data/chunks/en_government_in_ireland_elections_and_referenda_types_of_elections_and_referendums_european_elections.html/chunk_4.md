##  Who can vote in a European election?

Every Irish citizen aged 18 and over can vote in the European election. If you
are an Irish citizen but you are living in another EU country you can vote in
that country.

If you are from another EU Member State but are living in Ireland you can vote
in the European election in Ireland. To do so your name has to be on the [
register of electors ](/en/government-in-ireland/elections-and-
referenda/voting/registering-to-vote/) . If you are an EU citizen but have not
registered to vote at a previous European election in Ireland you must apply
for registration and complete a statutory declaration form, EP1 (available
from your local authority). The statutory declarations are sent to your home
Member State to make sure people are not voting twice.

You cannot vote in the European election in more than one constituency or
country.
