###  **What if I have received a Teagasc Student Maintenance Grant before?**

If you have completed a Level 5 course in the 2023/2024 college year and you
want to do a Level 6 course in 2024/2025, you must complete the Teagasc
Student Maintenance Grant Renewal/Reassessment Form 2024/2025.

These forms will be sent out in early September to students who received a
student maintenance grant in 2023/2024 and are progressing to a Level 6
course.

Up to 20% of students who qualified for a student maintenance grant in
2023/2024 will be reassessed for the 2024/2025.
