###  **What are apprenticeships?**

An apprenticeship is how people are trained in a craft trade or profession.

An apprenticeship programme provides on-the-job training with an employer
along with off-the-job training in an education centre. An apprenticeship can
last 2 to 4 years.

When you complete an apprenticeship programme, you will get a recognised
qualification at Level 5 or above on the NFQ framework.
