##  Introduction

If you owe money to someone else, then you are a **debtor** and the other
person is a **creditor** .

If you fail to pay a debt, your creditor can go to court to get a **judgment**
that you owe the debt. If your creditor has a judgment, it means they can now
use different ways to get the money from you. This is called **enforcing** **a
judgment** . The legal term is **execution** of the judgment.

The creditor chooses how to enforce the judgment, and can use several
different types of enforcement action at the same time. We explain these
below.
