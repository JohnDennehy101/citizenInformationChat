###  What about faulty goods or services?

In general, when a good is faulty you have the right to ask the seller for a [
repair, replacement or refund ](/en/consumer/shopping/problems-with-faulty-
goods/) . However, if the company has gone out of business, this makes it more
difficult to resolve.

To get a faulty good fixed, replaced or get a refund, try to:

  * Contact the new owner, or administrator, receiver or liquidator to see if they will fix the problem for you 
  * Check if the product came with a manufacturer guarantee or warranty. 

If there is a guarantee or warranty, you should check the terms and conditions
to see:

  * Whether it is still valid (for example, it has not expired) 
  * If the fault is covered and what you are entitled to 
  * How to make a claim 

Follow the claim process stated and contact the manufacturer as soon as
possible.
