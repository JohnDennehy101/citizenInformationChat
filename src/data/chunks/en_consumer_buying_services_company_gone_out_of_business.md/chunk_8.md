###  I have paid a deposit or my product is on order

If you have paid a deposit on goods or services and the company goes out of
business before delivery has been made, you may find it very difficult to get
either the item you paid for or a refund.

Contact the administrator, receiver or liquidator to see if you can get your
product or money back. The business might not have any money left to pay you.

If you paid the deposit by debit card or credit card, contact your bank or
card provider to see if it will reverse the transaction using the chargeback
process.
