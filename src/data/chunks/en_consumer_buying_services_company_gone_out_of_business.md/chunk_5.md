###  Company is gone into liquidation or receivership

If a liquidator or receiver has been appointed, the company is no longer run
by its owners. The company usually owes money to several creditors (a person
or company the business owes money to). If a business fails before you get a
product or service, then you are also a creditor.

Get the details of the liquidator or receiver (the person who is responsible
for settling the companyâ€™s debts) and make a claim in writing. You should
provide the following:

  * Details about the product you have paid for 
  * Exactly how much money you are owed 
  * What you would like them to do (for example, arrange for delivery of the item or full refund) 

However, there is no guarantee your claim will be successful. There are rules
for the priority to be given to various debts owed. Generally, you will be
treated as an _unsecured creditor_ . Revenue, banks and company employees are
secured creditors, so they get their money back before any customers. This
means that after the secured creditors get what they are owed there may not be
any money left to pay you.
