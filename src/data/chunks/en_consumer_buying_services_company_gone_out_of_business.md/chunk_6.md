###  If there is a new owner

If the company has been sold to a new owner, you need to find out if they have
taken on the previous ownerâ€™s liabilities and are willing to honour claims.
The new owner may not:

  * Be responsible for completing orders placed with the previous owner for goods and services not delivered 
  * Have to honour gift vouchers or gift cards issued by the previous owner 
  * Repair faulty products sold by the previous owner
