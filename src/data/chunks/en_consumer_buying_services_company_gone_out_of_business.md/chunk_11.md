##  Where to get more help

If a company has gone bust, and you have not got what you paid for, you can
try to get money back by asking for chargeback. This only applies if you paid
for the product or service by debit card or credit card. Contact your bank or
card provider to see if it will reverse the transaction (known as the
chargeback process).

Some other payment methods also have protection schemes (for example, PayPal
buyer protection). The CCPC has more information on [ chargeback
](https://www.ccpc.ie/consumers/shopping/disputed-card-transactions-
chargeback/) .
