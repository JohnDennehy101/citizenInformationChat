###  I have an unused gift voucher or credit note

If the company for which you have a voucher or credit note goes out of
business, you do not have formal rights to get a refund. This is because both
a gift voucher and a credit note are the previous ownerâ€™s responsibility. The
voucher becomes a debt the company has not paid and you are an unsecured
creditor.

It is still worth asking if the administrator, receiver, liquidator or new
owner will honour the voucher but it is unlikely you will get any money back.
