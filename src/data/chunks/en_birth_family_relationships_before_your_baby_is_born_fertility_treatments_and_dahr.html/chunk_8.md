##  Donor-assisted human reproduction

If you or your partner has an infertility problem, you may be able to get eggs
or sperm from a donor to help you conceive.

In Irish law, Donor-Assisted Human Reproduction (DAHR) is any procedure where
the aim of the procedure is for an embryo to be implanted in the womb of a
woman and one or both of the gametes (the sperm or the egg) has been provided
by a donor.

The donor (or donors) do not intend to be the legal parents of any children
born as a result of the treatment.

Donor sperm might be used if:

  * Your partner is not male 
  * Your partner has very few sperm, abnormal sperm or no sperm 
  * Your partner has a serious infection, or there is a high risk of passing on an inherited disease or condition 

Donor eggs might be used if:

  * The woman is infertile as a result of treatment for another medical condition, for example, following chemotherapy for cancer 
  * The woman stops producing eggs due to early menopause 
  * There is a high risk of passing on an inherited disease or condition 
  * IVF has been unsuccessful
