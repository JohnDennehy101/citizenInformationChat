###  Health (Assisted Human Reproduction) Bill 2022

Initially, the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015 was also meant to
deal with [ surrogacy ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/birth-family-
relationships/adoption-and-fostering/surrogacy/) arrangements. However, it was
ultimately decided to deal with these issues in a separate piece of
legislation.

The [ Health (Assisted Human Reproduction) Bill 2022
](https://www.oireachtas.ie/en/bills/bill/2023/26/) is not yet passed into law
but it will cover the regulation of a wide range of assisted human
reproduction practices undertaken in Ireland, including:

  * Gamete and embryo donation for assisted human reproduction (AHR) and research 
  * Domestic altruistic surrogacy 
  * Pre-implantation genetic testing of embryos 
  * Posthumous assisted human reproduction and 
  * Embryo and stem-cell research 

The regulation of international surrogacy, and the recognition of parentage of
domestic and international surrogacy arrangements that have already taken
place, are also included in the Bill.
