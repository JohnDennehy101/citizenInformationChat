###  If you defend the proceedings

If you have sent your appearance and defence form, the creditor must serve a
notice of trial on you at least 10 days before the court hearing.

At the hearing, the judge hears the arguments from the creditor and from you
and makes a decision. It could be a judgment in favour of the creditor or to
dismiss the action.

If the judge considers that you cannot pay the amount through no fault of
yours, the judge may elect to pause the enforcement of the court order for a
period of time â€“ this is known as [ a stay of execution ](/en/money-and-
tax/personal-finance/debt/enforcement-of-judgments#lff299) . Alternatively,
the judge may make an order for payment by instalments.

If you do not defend the proceedings, there is no hearing so it is highly
unlikely that a stay of execution or order of payment by instalments will be
granted.
