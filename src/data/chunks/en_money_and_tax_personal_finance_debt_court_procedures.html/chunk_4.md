##  Court procedures

The proceedings are started by the person to whom you owe money. That person
(or group of people or company) is the creditor and the _claimant_ or
_plaintiff_ in the case. You are the debtor and the _respondent_ or
_defendant_ in the case.

The procedures and the documents which are used are different depending on
which court is involved and sometimes depending on which kind of debt is
involved.

In general, you are given documents that set out the details of what you owe.
You can choose to defend the action. This means that you must provide a
document in reply. This can argue that you do not owe the money, or that the
contract is not valid, or some other legal defence. If you do not do anything,
then the judgment will probably be awarded against you.

In general, if you are served with a document starting legal proceedings, you
have 3 options:

  * You usually have a number of days in which to pay the debt, in which case the proceedings do not start. In legal language, _the proceedings are stayed_ . 
  * If you cannot pay what is owed and you have no defence, you can agree to an order being made. 
  * If you intend to defend the action, you must serve the necessary replying documents. Then a date is usually set for a court hearing to decide what happens.
