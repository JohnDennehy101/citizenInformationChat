##  Circuit Court procedure

The procedure in [ the Circuit Court ](/en/justice/courts-system/circuit-
court/) is similar to that in the District Court but there are some
differences in the documents used.

The proceedings start with the creditor serving an [ ordinary civil bill
](https://www.courts.ie/content/ordinary-civil-bill) on you. This is similar
to the claim notice used in the District Court. The claim being made by the
creditor is set out in the indorsement of claim. This must set out the details
such as the date and the content of the contract.

The [ civil bill ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/justice/civil-
law/circuit-court-procedures/#7c1cbe) states that, if you want to defend the
case, you must enter an appearance within 10 days. This period can be extended
by agreement or by direction of the court. Entering an appearance means that
you must lodge a specified form with the County Registrar and give a copy to
the creditor or his solicitor. The County Registrar organises the business of
the Circuit Court and has a similar role to that of the Clerk of the District
Court.

If you do not want to defend the action, you may consent to the claim.

If you do not [ enter an appearance
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/justice/civil-law/circuit-court-
procedures/#deb4bb) or if you enter an appearance and then do not deliver a
defence, the creditor may [ apply to the court for a _judgment in default of
appearance_ ](https://www.courts.ie/content/notice-motion-judgment-default-
appearance) to get a judgment.

Once the judgment has been granted, the creditor may then apply for an
_execution order_ to [ enforce the judgment ](/en/money-and-tax/personal-
finance/debt/enforcement-of-debt-judgments/) .
