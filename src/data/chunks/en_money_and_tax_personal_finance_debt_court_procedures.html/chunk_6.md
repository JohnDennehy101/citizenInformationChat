##  Which court?

Which court deals with the case depends on how much you owe. If you owe:

  * Less than €15,000, the court proceedings should be brought in the District Court 
  * Between €15,000 and €75,000, the court proceedings should be brought in the Circuit Court 
  * If you owe more than €75,000, the court proceedings should be brought in the High Court
