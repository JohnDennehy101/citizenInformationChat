###  Legal aid

Most court proceedings about debt are under [ civil law
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/justice/civil_law/) , rather than
criminal law. You may be eligible for [ civil legal aid ](/en/justice/legal-
aid-and-advice/civil-legal-advice-and-legal-aid/) if you pass the means test
and if your case is likely to succeed. If you accept that you owe the debt and
that you have no defence to the claim, then your case is unlikely to succeed
and you would not get civil legal aid.

If you do not pay an [ instalment order
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/money-and-tax/personal-
finance/debt/enforcement-of-debt-judgments/#a46728) , you may have to go to
court for committal proceedings to decide if you should be sent to prison. You
can apply for [ criminal legal aid ](/en/justice/legal-aid-and-
advice/criminal-legal-aid/) and the judge will decide whether you get it.
