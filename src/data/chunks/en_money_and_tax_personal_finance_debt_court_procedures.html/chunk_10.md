##  High Court procedure

Proceedings in the High Court are generally started by means of a [ summary
summons ](https://www.courts.ie/content/originating-summons-appearance#_mon4)
. Summons are often served in person. However, there are [ other ways a
summons can be served ](https://www.courts.ie/rules/service-summons) .

The summary summons must include an indorsement of claim. This sets out the
amount which the creditor claims is owed plus costs. It also states that, if
you pay within 6 days, the proceedings will not go ahead (the proceedings are
stayed). If the creditor is a licensed moneylender, this must be stated in the
indorsement of claim. Other details about the loan agreement must also be
stated, such as the rate of interest.

When you get a summary summons, you have 3 options:

  1. Pay the amount owed plus costs within 6 days and the proceedings will not go ahead 
  2. Consent to judgment and ask for further time for payment 
  3. Indicate an intention to defend the proceedings by [ entering an appearance ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/justice/civil-law/circuit-court-procedures/#deb4bb) . You do this by delivering a memorandum in writing to the [ Central Office of the High Court ](https://courts.ie/content/central-office-high-court) within 8 days of the service of the summons. 

If you do not enter an appearance, the creditor may get judgment in default of
appearance from the Central Office of the High Court. In some cases, the
permission of the Master of the High Court is required before such a judgment
can be granted.

If you do enter an appearance and defend the proceedings, then the case is
heard by a High Court judge and judgment against you may be given.

Sometimes, the creditor looks for [ an order of _fieri facias_
](https://www.courts.ie/content/execution#_FP101) at the same time. This is a
court order instructing a sheriff to obtain the amount owed by possessing and
selling the property of a judgment debtor.
