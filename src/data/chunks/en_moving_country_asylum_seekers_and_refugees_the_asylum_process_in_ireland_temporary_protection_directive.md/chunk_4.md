###  What is included in the Directive?

The Directive sets out the minimum standards for giving protection to people
in the event of a mass influx. Individual EU countries can grant additional
rights, but cannot provide less than what is set out in the Directive.

The Directive applies to all EU countries except Denmark.

The Directive defines ‘mass influx’ as a ‘large number of displaced persons,
who come from a specific country or geographical area.’ There is no minimum
number of people needed for it to be considered a mass influx.
