##  Temporary protection and international protection (asylum)

People who have temporary protection can [ apply for international protection
](/en/moving-country/asylum-seekers-and-refugees/the-asylum-process-in-
ireland/applying-for-refugee-status-in-ireland/) . However, it is not possible
to be resident in Ireland with temporary protection and be an international
protection applicant at the same time.

An international protection applicant must withdraw their application for
international protection to benefit from temporary protection. If someone has
temporary protection and they make an application for international
protection, then they no longer have the benefits of temporary protection.

For example, a person with temporary protection has the right to work
immediately. An international protection applicant can apply for permission to
work only after 6 months if they have not received a decision in that time on
their application for international protection.

You should get legal advice before making an application for international
protection.
