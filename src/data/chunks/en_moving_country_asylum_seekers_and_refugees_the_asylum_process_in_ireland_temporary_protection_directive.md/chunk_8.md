##  Rights under the Temporary Protection Directive

Once the protection is triggered, EU member states must give anyone who
benefits from temporary protection a residence permit while the protection is
in place.

Formalities regarding visas and entry to the country must be kept to a
minimum. People who have temporary protection must get a document that clearly
explains the provisions of temporary protection.

During the temporary protection period, EU member states must provide:

  * Access to suitable accommodation 
  * Access to social welfare and medical care 
  * Access to education for children under 18 
  * The legal right to access employment 

Adults are also allowed to take part in vocational training.

The EU member state may provide access to third level education, but this is
not required under the Directive.
