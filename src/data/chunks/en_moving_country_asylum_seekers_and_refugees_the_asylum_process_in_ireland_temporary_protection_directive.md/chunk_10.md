###  Unaccompanied minors

EU member states must make sure that unaccompanied minors are placed with
appropriate adults. This may be with the childâ€™s relatives, a foster family,
with the adult who was with the child when they fled the country, or in
reception centres with suitable facilities for children.

The views of the child must be considered in accordance with their age and
maturity.
