##  How temporary protection is activated

The [ EU Commission ](/en/government-in-ireland/european-government/eu-
institutions/european-commission/) proposes the activation of the Directive.
The [ European Council ](/en/government-in-ireland/european-government/eu-
institutions/european-council/) then votes on this proposal. EU member states
can request that the EU Commission make the proposal.

If the Council votes in favour, it will issue a _Council Decision_ . This
introduces temporary protection in all the EU member states (not including
Denmark).

The Decision must include the following information:

  * The groups of people to whom temporary protection applies 
  * The date temporary protection takes effect 
  * Information from EU member states on their capacity to receive people 
  * Information from the EU Commission, the United National High Commission on Refugees (UNHRC) and other international organisations
