###  **Consent and your next-of-kin**

If you gave your consent to donate your organs on an [ organ donor card
](https://www.ika.ie/get-a-donor-card/) , the app or your driving licence,
this will tell the hospital that you are willing to have your organs used for
transplant after you die.

You should tell your next-of-kin that you want to be an organ donor but they
do not have to abide by your wishes, as their consent is always required.

The medical team at the hospital needs your next-of-kin to consent to donating
your organs after you die. If your next-of-kin refuses to donate your organs
the procedure will not go ahead.
