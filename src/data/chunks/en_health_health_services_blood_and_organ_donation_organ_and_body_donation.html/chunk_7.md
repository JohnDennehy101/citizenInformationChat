##  Donate my whole body to medical research

You can donate your whole body for medical research to help health workers to
learn more about anatomy, research and treating illness.

If you want to donate your body for medical research, you should contact one
of the medical research schools located in the colleges listed below. Each
medical school has its own procedures for entering into an agreement with you:

  * [ University College Dublin ](http://www.ucd.ie/medicine/bodydonation/)
  * [ Trinity College Dublin ](https://www.tcd.ie/medicine/anatomy/donation-of-remains/)
  * [ The Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland ](http://www.rcsi.ie/anatomy-donations-of-remains)
  * [ University College Cork ](https://www.ucc.ie/en/anatomy/uccanatomicaldonations/)
  * [ National University of Ireland, Galway ](http://www.nuigalway.ie/anatomy/donorprogramme/#)

You should also make sure that your next-of-kin know that you want to donate
your whole body to medical research by:

  * Telling them and/or 
  * Stating that you wish to donate your body for medical research in your [ will ](/en/death/before-a-death/making-a-will/) . 

The law is unclear on this but it would seem that your next-of-kin, or whoever
is responsible for the cremation or interment of your body, are not
necessarily obliged to go along with your wishes.

When the [ Human Tissue Bill 2022
](https://www.oireachtas.ie/en/bills/bill/2022/121/) is implemented, it will
set standards and arrangements for donating your body to an anatomy school.
