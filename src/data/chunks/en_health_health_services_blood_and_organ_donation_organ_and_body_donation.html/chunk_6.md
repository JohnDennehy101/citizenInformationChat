###  Post-mortems and organ donation

If your death is reported to the Coroner, they must give their permission
before organ donation can take place, as well as the written consent of your
next-of-kin. Read more about the [ role of the Coroner ](/en/death/sudden-or-
unexplained-death/coroners/) and [ post-mortems ](/en/death/sudden-or-
unexplained-death/postmortems/) .

If you donated your organs for transplantation, this will happen in an
operating theatre, as this is not a post-mortem practice.

If you donated your organs for research, this will happen in a mortuary as it
is a post-mortem procedure.

When commenced, the [ Human Tissue Bill 2022
](https://www.oireachtas.ie/en/bills/bill/2022/121/) will make changes to
current post-mortem practice and procedure. It will require additional
communication and information sharing with families when a post-mortem by a
coroner is needed.

It will also introduce a consent framework for how consent should be obtained
from families for post-mortems that are not carried out by the coroner.
