###  **What if I have lost the deeds to a property registered with the
Registry of Deeds?**

If you lose the deeds to a property which is not registered with the Land
Registry, you can get a copy of your memorial or ROD application form from the
Registry of Deeds. These documents summarise the change of ownership or
mortgage and can be used to replace a lost or misplaced deed. An ROD
application form does not have the same legal effect as a deed, but it
provides secondary evidence of the contents of the deed. You can get a
certified copy of an ROD application form for €20 and a plain copy for €1 per
page.
