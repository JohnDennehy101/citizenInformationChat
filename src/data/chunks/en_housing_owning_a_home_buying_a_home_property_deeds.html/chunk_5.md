###  **Land Registry maps**

The Land Registry maintains maps or _title plans_ of property described in its
registers. These maps do not indicate if a boundary includes a hedge, wall or
ditch, so the registers are not conclusive on boundaries. Any dispute about
boundaries must be resolved by the people involved. If they cannot reach
agreement on the boundaries, the courts will resolve the matter.
