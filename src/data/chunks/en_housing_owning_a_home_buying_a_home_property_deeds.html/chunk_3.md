###  Recording property transactions

There are 2 separate systems for recording property transactions:

  * The **Land Registry system** is where property _ownership_ (or _title_ ) is registered, and property deeds are filed. 
  * The **Registry of Deeds** **system** records the existence of deeds and conveyances for _unregistered property_ . (Unregistered property is property where the title is not registered with the Land Registry.) 

Your [ solicitor
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/justice/courtroom/solicitors/) will
know which system to record your property transaction with. Both systems are
managed by [ Tailte Éireann ](https://www.tailte.ie/registration/) .

Property registration in Ireland is gradually moving away from the older
system that records deeds in the Registry of Deeds to the ‘title registration
system’ at the Land Registry.

Since June 2011, it is compulsory for unregistered property purchased in
Ireland to be registered with the Land Registry. Currently, almost 90% of the
legal titles in Ireland are now registered in the Land Registry.
