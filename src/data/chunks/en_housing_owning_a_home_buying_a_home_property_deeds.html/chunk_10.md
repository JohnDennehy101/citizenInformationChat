##  Property registration and property fraud

Tailte Éireann has a property alert service so property owners can monitor
their registered properties for fraudulent activity. Property fraud could
involve someone pretending to be you and trying to sell or mortgage your
property without you knowing. If you sign up to the property alert service,
you will get an email or text if someone lodges an application about your
property with Tailte Éireann. If the activity is fraudulent you can take
action. To find out more, or to sign up for the service, visit [ landdirect.ie
