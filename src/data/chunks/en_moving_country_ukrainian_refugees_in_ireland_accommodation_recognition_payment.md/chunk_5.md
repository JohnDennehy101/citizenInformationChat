###  Do I have to repay the ARP if I provide accommodation for less than 6
months?

You must make a commitment to provide the accommodation for 6 months. However,
if you are unable to meet the 6-month commitment, you do not have to repay the
ARP paid to you for the months that the person covered by the EU Temporary
Protection Directive lived in your accommodation.

You must notify the Department of Social Protection that the person has left
your accommodation.
