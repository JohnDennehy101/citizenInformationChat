##  What is the Accommodation Recognition Payment?

The Accommodation Recognition Payment (ARP) is a tax-free payment of €800 per
month for each property used to provide accommodation to refugees from
Ukraine. The payment increased to €800 per month from 1 December 2022.

The accommodation must be provided for at least 6 months and meet [ the
required standards ](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/85e79-accommodation-
standards/) .

You cannot get this payment if there is a rental agreement with the person
being hosted. However, the payment is not affected if they contribute towards
costs such as utilities and food.

The ARP can be back dated to 4 March 2022 or from when you started providing
accommodation. The rate of payment was €400 per month until 1 December 2022.

It is not taken into account in the means test for any grants or payments from
the Department of Social Protection or other public bodies.
