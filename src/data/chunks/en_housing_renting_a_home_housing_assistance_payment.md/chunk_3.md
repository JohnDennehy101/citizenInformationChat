##  Who can get the HAP payment?

To get the Housing Assistance Payment, you must be on the [ local authority’s
housing list ](/en/housing/local-authority-and-social-housing/social-housing-
waiting-lists/) . This means that you qualify for social housing support.

To qualify for social housing support, you must:

  1. **Have a legal right to remain in the State on a long-term basis** . People who have temporary protection, such as Ukrainians fleeing the war, cannot apply for social housing as their right to remain is short-term. 
  2. **Be** **eligible** **for social housing** . Your income must be below a certain amount, and you must not have suitable alternative accommodation. 
  3. **Be** **in need of** **social housing**

Our page [ applying for local authority/social housing ](/en/housing/local-
authority-and-social-housing/applying-for-local-authority-housing/) has
details of how the local authority assesses you for social housing support.

You cannot transfer from any other form of social housing to HAP. However, you
may be asked to transfer from Rent Supplement to HAP – see ‘ [ How do I apply
for HAP ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/housing/renting-a-home/help-
with-renting/housing-assistance-payment/#9ea5bb) ’.
