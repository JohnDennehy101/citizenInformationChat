##  What happens when you are a HAP tenant?

When you have qualified for social housing support and are getting HAP, you
will continue to get the payment, even if you no longer meet all the
qualifying criteria of the social housing assessment. For example, if your
income rises above the income threshold for social housing, you will remain
eligible for HAP. However, you must inform the local authority if your income
changes, so they can recalculate the differential rent you pay, see Rent
contribution below.

The local authority will inspect your accommodation within 8 months of the
first HAP payment to your landlord, unless the accommodation has already been
inspected in the last twelve months. An inspector will check that the
accommodation meets the [ minimum standards for rented housing
](/en/housing/renting-a-home/tenants-rights-and-responsibilities/minimum-
standards-for-rented-homes/) .

Your housing needs have now been met under HAP and you will no longer be on
the local authorityâ€™s [ housing waiting list ](/en/housing/local-authority-
and-social-housing/social-housing-waiting-lists/) . However, if you still want
to be considered for local authority housing or housing provided by an [
approved housing body ](/en/housing/local-authority-and-social-
housing/approved-housing-bodies/) , you can apply to the local authority to be
placed on the transfer list.
