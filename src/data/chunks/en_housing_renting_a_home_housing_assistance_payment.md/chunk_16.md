##  How do I make a complaint?

You can complain if you donâ€™t agree with a decision your local authority made
about your HAP application or payment, or you are unhappy with how they dealt
with you.

You complain to your [ local authority
](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/942f74-local-authorities/) first. They
should have an internal complaints procedure on their website with information
about:

  * How you can make a complaint 
  * How your complaint will be dealt with 
  * How long it will take to respond to you about your complaint 
  * How to appeal, if there is an internal appeals process 

If you are not happy with how your local authority deals with your complaint,
or you think you have been unfairly treated, you can take your complaint to
the Ombudsman. The [ Office of the Ombudsman
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/government-in-ireland/how-government-
works/standards-and-accountability/office-of-the-ombudsman/) investigates
complaints about local authorities and other public bodies.
