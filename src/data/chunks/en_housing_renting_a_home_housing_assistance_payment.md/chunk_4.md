##  How does the HAP scheme work?

You must find your own private rented accommodation within the HAP rent
limits. The local authority will not find the accommodation for you.

You [ cannot be discriminated against when renting because you are getting
certain payments, ](https://www.ihrec.ie/your-rights/advertising/housing-
assistance-payment/) including HAP, so landlords cannot state that HAP is not
accepted when advertising accommodation.

The local authority pays the landlord each month and you pay a weekly rent
contribution to the local authority. However, you are not a local authority
tenant. The rental agreement is between you and your landlord and your tenancy
is covered by residential tenancies legislation. This means that you have
certain [ rights and responsibilities ](/en/housing/renting-a-home/tenants-
rights-and-responsibilities/tenants-rights-and-obligations/) , as will [ your
landlord ](/en/housing/renting-a-home/landlords-rights-and-
responsibilities/landlords-rights-and-obligations/) . Your tenancy must be [
registered with the Residential Tenancies Board ](/en/housing/renting-a-
home/landlords-rights-and-responsibilities/registering-a-tenancy/) every year.

You may be able to claim HAP if you are [ sharing accommodation with your
landlord ](/en/housing/renting-a-home/tenants-rights-and-
responsibilities/sharing-accommodation-with-your-landlord/) .
