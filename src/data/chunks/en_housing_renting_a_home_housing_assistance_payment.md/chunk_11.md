###  How do I pay rent to the local authority?

Your weekly rent contribution to the local authority should be paid using
either:

  * The [ Household Budget Scheme ](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/claiming-a-social-welfare-payment/household-budget-scheme/) at the post office 
  * A standing order with your bank 

If your rent is not automatically paid in these 2 ways, you can pay it:

  * [ Online using the Housing Assistance Payment Portal ](https://happayments.limerick.ie/#/login)
  * Using the [ HAP app (pdf) ](https://www.hap.ie/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/HAPAppHowToGuide.pdf)
  * By phone on 061 529 654 
  * Using a HAP Bill Pay Card in any Post Office or shop that uses [ PostPoint ](https://www.postpoint.ie/)

You can also get a statement of your HAP payments online or using the HAP app.

If you overpay your rent by mistake, you can [ apply for a refund
