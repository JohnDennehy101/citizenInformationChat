###  Capital

Capital includes the value of savings, investments, shares or any property you
have (but not your own home).

If you are under 70, the first €20,000 of your capital is not taken into
account.

If you are 70 or over, the first €50,000 of your capital is not taken into
account. Find out more about [ capital not included in the means test

Capital is assessed by assuming an amount of weekly income for the capital you
have above a certain figure.
