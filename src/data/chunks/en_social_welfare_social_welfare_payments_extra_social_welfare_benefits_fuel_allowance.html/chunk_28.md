##  How to apply for Fuel Allowance

If you apply for Fuel Allowance after the start of the Fuel Allowance season,
it will not be backdated.

You do not need to reapply for Fuel Allowance each year as long as, your
circumstances remain the same and you continue to get the same social welfare
payment.
