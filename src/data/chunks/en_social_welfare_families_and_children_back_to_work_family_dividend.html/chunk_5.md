###  State Pension (Contributory) and BTWFD

From January 2024, you can  choose to claim your State Pension (Contributory)
any time between age 66 and 70.

If you defer claiming your pension to after age 66, and you qualify for BTWFD,
you may be able to apply for or continue to get BTWFD until you turn 70. You
must meet all the usual qualifying conditions, including coming from a
relevant payment.

If you are age 66 or over, you must apply for BTWFD using a paper application
available from your local Intreo Office or Social Welfare Branch Office.
