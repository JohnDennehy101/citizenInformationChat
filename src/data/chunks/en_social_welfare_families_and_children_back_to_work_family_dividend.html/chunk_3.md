##  How to qualify for the Back to Work Family Dividend

You can get the Back to Work Family Dividend (BTWFD) if you have at least one
[ qualified child ](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/claiming-a-
social-welfare-payment/claiming-and-increase-in-your-payment-for-a-child-
dependant/) and you are getting one of the following payments:

  * [ Jobseeker’s Allowance ](/en/social-welfare/unemployed-people/jobseekers-allowance/) or [ Jobseeker’s Benefit ](/en/social-welfare/unemployed-people/jobseekers-benefit/) for at least 12 months (312 days of unemployment) of which at least 6 months (156 days of unemployment) must have been in the last year. Only time spent on your current jobseeker’s claim can be used to make up the days 
  * [ One-Parent Family Payment (OFP) ](/en/social-welfare/families-and-children/one-parent-family-payment/)
  * [ Jobseeker’s Transitional payment ](/en/social-welfare/families-and-children/moving-from-ofp/) (paid to people who are not cohabiting with children aged between 7 and 13 years) 

You must stop claiming your qualifying payment to get BTWFD.

If you are not already in insurable employment or self-employment, you must
take up employment within 4 weeks of leaving your original payment or scheme.
The employment must be in the State.

You can combine time on a jobseeker’s payment with time spent on a qualifying
scheme to meet the eligibility requirements. If you went from a qualifying
payment to a qualifying scheme and then find work, you can go directly onto
the BTWFD scheme without having to sign back onto your original payment.

Qualifying schemes are:

  * Community Employment 
  * Tús 
  * Rural Social Scheme 
  * Back to Education Allowance 
  * Job Initiative Scheme 

If you were employed or self-employed and were getting a One-Parent Family
Payment (OFP) and your OFP has stopped because your youngest child has reached
the age limit you may be eligible for BTWFD – if you do not sign onto another
primary social welfare payment.

The Back to Work Family Dividend can be paid with [ Working Family Payment
(WFP) ](/en/social-welfare/families-and-children/working-family-payment/) and
is not taken into account in the means test for WFP.

The Back to Work Family Dividend (BTWFD) can also be paid with [ Maternity
Benefit ](/en/social-welfare/families-and-children/maternity-benefit/) and [
Paternity Benefit. ](/en/social-welfare/families-and-children/paternity-
benefit/)
