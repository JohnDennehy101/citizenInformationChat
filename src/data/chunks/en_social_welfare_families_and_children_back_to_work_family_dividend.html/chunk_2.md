##  What is the Back to Work Family Dividend?

The Back to Work Family Dividend (BTWFD) helps families to move from social
welfare into employment. It gives financial support to people with children
who stop claiming a jobseeker's payment or a One-Parent Family Payment because
they are in work or start work. Work includes employment or self-employment.

The BTWFD is paid for up to 2 years. You will be paid a weekly [ Increase for
a Qualified Child ](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/claiming-a-
social-welfare-payment/claiming-and-increase-in-your-payment-for-a-child-
dependant/) (up to a maximum of 4 children) for the first year in employment.
Half the weekly amount will be paid in the second year.

To qualify for BTWFD, you and all members of your family (including your adult
dependant) must sign off all primary social welfare payments. The BTWFD can be
paid with the [ Working Family Payment ](/en/social-welfare/families-and-
children/working-family-payment/) and some other non-primary social welfare
payments. You can also claim certain short-term illness and injury benefits
with BTWFD for up to 36 days - see 'Other payments and BTWFD' below.

You must satisfy the [ habitual residence condition ](/en/social-
welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/social-assistance-payments/habitual-
residence-condition/) to get BTWFD.
