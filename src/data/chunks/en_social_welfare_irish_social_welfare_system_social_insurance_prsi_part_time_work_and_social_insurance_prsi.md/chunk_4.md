###  **Example: PRSI contribution week runs from Monday**

In a year when 1 January falls on a Monday, then each PRSI contribution week
in that year runs from Monday to the following Sunday. If your work pattern is
week-on, week-off, Monday to Friday, you miss paying PRSI in every second PRSI
contribution week, as you are not working at all during each of those weeks.
In this situation, you would pay only 26 contributions in the year.

Similarly, if your pattern is Monday to Friday for 3 weeks, with 1 week off,
you would pay 39 contributions in the year.

However, if you work Wednesday to Friday in one week, followed by Monday and
Tuesday the next, you will pay the full 52 contributions in the year, as you
will have worked during each Monday-Sunday PRSI contribution week.
