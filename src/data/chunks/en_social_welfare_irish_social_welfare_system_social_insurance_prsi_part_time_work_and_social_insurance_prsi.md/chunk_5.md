###  Situation in 2024

In 2024, 1 January fell on a Monday which means that each PRSI contribution
week runs from Monday to Sunday. For example, if your part-time work
arrangement requires that you work part of every week between the days Monday
to Friday, you will get your full 52 PRSI contributions for 2024.
