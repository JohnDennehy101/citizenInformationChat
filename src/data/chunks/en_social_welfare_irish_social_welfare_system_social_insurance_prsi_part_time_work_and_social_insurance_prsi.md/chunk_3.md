##  How many PRSI contributions do part-time workers pay?

You pay a PRSI contribution for each PRSI contribution week you work. You must
be **working on at least 1 day in each PRSI contribution week** to pay a
contribution.

If you have a week-on, week-off work pattern, you may not pay a contribution
in the week you are off if it coincides with the PRSI contribution week. This
can happen whether you work a full 5 days every second week (such as Monday to
Friday) or if you work a split week, such as Wednesday to Friday one week,
followed by Monday and Tuesday the next. It all depends on the starting day of
the PRSI contribution week, which is determined by where 1 January falls each
year.
