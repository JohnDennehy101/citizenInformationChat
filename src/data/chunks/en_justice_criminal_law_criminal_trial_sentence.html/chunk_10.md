###  The offenderâ€™s reaction to committing the offence

You can expect a reduced sentence for pleading guilty. A guilty plea will save
the court time and can be seen as a sign of remorse. In sex cases or cases
involving violence, a guilty plea will spare the victim the trauma of having
to relive the events in court.

While a guilty plea may lead to a lighter sentence you will not be given a
harsher sentence because you pleaded not guilty. There is a constitutional
right to be tried and you cannot be penalised for exercising this right.
