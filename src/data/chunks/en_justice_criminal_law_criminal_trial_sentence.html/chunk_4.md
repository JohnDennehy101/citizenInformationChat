###  Who decides the sentence?

In Ireland it is always a judge (or a panel of judges in the case of the [
Special Criminal Court ](/en/justice/courts-system/special-criminal-court/) or
the [ Court of Appeal ](/en/justice/courts-system/court-of-appeal/) ) who
decides the sentence. In a jury trial the juryâ€™s role is to decide whether you
are guilty or not guilty. They have no role in sentencing you.
