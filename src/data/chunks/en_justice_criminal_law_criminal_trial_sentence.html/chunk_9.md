###  Impact of the offence on the victim

The judge will ask that a victim impact report is prepared in most cases of a
serious nature. In some cases a judge hears direct evidence from the victim
through a [ victim impact statement ](https://www.dppireland.ie/victims-
witnesses/making-a-victim-impact-statement/) . This has a bearing on the
sentence.
