###  Personal circumstances of the offender

Your personal circumstances is one of the most important factors a judge
considers before sentencing and they may request a probation report. In
considering your personal circumstances the judge takes the following into
account:

  * Drug addiction 
  * Age 
  * Disability or illness 
  * Family circumstances 
  * Other penalties as a result of conviction (for example, losing your job) 
  * Previous convictions 
  * Character (evidence may be given of your previous good character) 

**Character references** **after convictions for sexual offences**

From 31 August 2024, if you are convicted of a sexual offence and are being
sentenced there are different rules. The person giving the character reference
about you must be under oath or give the character reference by affidavit.
This means that the person giving the character reference can be [ cross-
examined in court ](/en/justice/criminal-law/criminal-trial/criminal-trial/) .
