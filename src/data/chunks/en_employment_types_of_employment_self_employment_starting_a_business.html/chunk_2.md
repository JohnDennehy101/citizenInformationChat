##  Introduction

If you are thinking about starting a business, there are supports available to
help you with planning, getting set up and funding and finance.

You should consider the regulations that apply (for example, in relation to
paying tax and hiring employees), and the range of financial supports
available to you.

Whether you are currently employed, unemployed, or coming from outside Ireland
to set up a business, this page covers some of these important topics.
