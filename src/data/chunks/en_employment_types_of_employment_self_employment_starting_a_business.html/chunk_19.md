###  Paying tax and getting tax relief

How your business is taxed depends on whether it is a ‘limited company’ (see
‘Deciding on the legal structure of your business’ above).

If your business is a company, then it is liable for [ corporation tax
](http://www.revenue.ie/en/tax/ct/index.html) . If your business is not a
company, you are considered to be a ‘sole trader’ and you pay tax under the [
self-assessment system ](http://www.revenue.ie/en/tax/it/leaflets/it10.html) .
