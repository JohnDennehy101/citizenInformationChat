###  **Warsaw Convention 1929**

The first international law introduced, is known as the Warsaw Convention
(1929). There have since been several changes and reviews to the original
Warsaw Convention. This includes increases to the monetary liability limits.
These amendments together with the original Warsaw Convention are known
collectively as the _Warsaw System._

Over time the liability limits became outdated and were considered too low by
present-day standards. In addition, the laws governing airline liability
became fragmented and confusing, as some countries did not introduce all the
various amendments to the original laws.
