###  3\. Keep the luggage labels and your boarding card

You should also keep the luggage labels you were given when you checked in
your luggage and your boarding card. The luggage labels have a barcode and a
number. This reference number relates to your luggage and will help the
airline identify your luggage and help trace it for you.
