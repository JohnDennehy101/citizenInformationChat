##  Death or injury to passengers

In case of death, wounding or any other bodily injury, there is no financial
limit on the liability of an EU airline for damages sustained. For damages up
to 128,821 SDRs, the airline cannot contest compensation claims. Above that
amount, the airline can defend itself against a claim by proving that it was
not negligent or otherwise at fault.

If for example, you are injured or killed, the airline must make an advance
payment to cover immediate economic needs within 15 days. In case of death,
this advanced payment must be at least 16,000 SDRs. However an advance payment
is not a recognition of liability, and may be offset against any further
payments.

Any court action to claim damages must be taken within 2 years from the date
the plane arrived or should have arrived.
