###  **Travelling with EU airlines**

In 1997, the EU introduced legislation to ensure that the same limits were in
place for all EU member states. This standardised the liability of EU airlines
(in case of death or injury to passengers).

[ EU Regulation 889/2002 (pdf) ](http://eur-
lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2002:140:0002:0005:EN:PDF) was
introduced to amend the 1997 Regulation. This brought the EU states into line
with the Montreal Convention. It standardised liability limits and legal
defences in respect of European carriers, regardless of whether the accident
happened on an international flight or a flight within the EU.

Under this Regulation, an EU airline must be insured to a level that allows
for all persons entitled to compensation to receive the full amount to which
they are entitled. The airline must also provide each passenger with a written
indication of the liability limit for the flight in respect of:

  * Death or injury 
  * Luggage which is destroyed, lost or damaged 
  * Damage caused by delay
