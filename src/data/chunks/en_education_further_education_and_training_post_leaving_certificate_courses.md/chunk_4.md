**National Framework of Qualifications (NFQ)**

The qualification you get at the end of your training will depend on the type
of course you have chosen.

Many of the one-year PLC courses offer [ Quality and Qualifications Ireland
(QQI) ](http://www.qqi.ie/) accreditation at level 5 on the [ National
Framework of Qualifications ](https://www.qqi.ie/what-we-do/the-
qualifications-system/national-framework-of-qualifications) , while other more
advanced courses may offer QQI level 6, which can lead to further studies at
third level. Other qualifications such as City and Guilds are also available.
It is important to check out the qualification attached to a particular course
before you decide to enrol.

The National Framework of Qualifications is made up of different levels. It
shows learners their progression through the education system.
