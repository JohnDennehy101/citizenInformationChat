##  PLC course fees

Since September 2022, you do not have to pay a participant contribution fee
for a PLC course.

Colleges offering PLC courses usually have an additional 'course charge' to
cover such expenses as books, uniforms, student services, professional
registration fees and exam fees. The amount varies from college to college.
Everyone has to pay the 'course charge'.
