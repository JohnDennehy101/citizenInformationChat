##  Can I ride a horse on a public road?

You can ride your horse on a public road, but you must bring your horse
licence if you are riding in a designated control area. You must follow the
rules of the road for horse riding.

You can find [ information about horse safety on the road
](http://www.rsa.ie/en/RSA/Pedestrians-and-Cyclists/Horse-Road-Safety/) , and
a [ booklet on Horse Road Safety on Public Roads (pdf)
](http://www.rsa.ie/Documents/Road%20Safety/Horse_Safety/RSA_Horse_road_safety_booklet.pdf)
from the Road Safety Authority.

If you take your horse into a public place, you must make sure that it is
under your control and you are not breaking any laws. This includes bye-laws
from [ your local authority ](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/942f74-local-
authorities/) .
