##  Do horses have to be microchipped?

Your horse must be microchipped if its passport was issued after 1 July 2009.

The microchip is a tiny computer chip that a vet implants under the horses
skin of the horse so it can be identified.

Only a vet can implant the microchip. The information on the microchip links
the horse to the horse’s passport and to the details registered on the PIO’s
database.

Your vet will charge a fee for microchipping your horse.
