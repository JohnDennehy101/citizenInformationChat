##  Do I need a license to own a horse in Ireland?

You must have a horse license if your horse is kept in a control area. A
control area is a specific place designated by a local authority in their
Control of Horses Byelaws and may include all of or part of the area the local
authority is responsible for.

When the local authority is making bye-laws, it must give details of the
proposed control areas in local newspapers. [ Contact your local authority
](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/942f74-local-authorities/) to get more
information on control areas for horses.

Your local authority keeps a register of all horse licences they issue.

**How do I get a horse licence?**

You can apply to your local authority for a horse licence. You will need:

  * A completed application form available from [ your local authority ](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/942f74-local-authorities/)
  * The fee 

Your local authority will want to check that you meet the standards to keep a
horse. For example, that your horse will be properly cared for and stabled.

If someone under 16 owns a horse, the head of the household is considered the
owner of the horse, as horses canâ€™t be sold to anyone under 16.
