##  If you donâ€™t want to take an alternative job

You might not want to take the alternative job - for example if it pays less
or it is a different type of work.

But if the job offer is reasonable (see above) and you refuse it without good
reason, you may lose your entitlement to a redundancy payment.

A good reason could be about the job itself or about your personal situation.
You might give reasons like:

  * Lower pay 
  * Longer journey to work or lack of public transport 
  * Extra costs of getting to work 

If you have good reason to refuse the alternative job offer and are dismissed
as a result, you may be entitled to claim [ statutory redundancy
](/en/employment/unemployment-and-redundancy/redundancy/redundancy-payments/)
or [ unfair dismissal ](/en/employment/unemployment-and-
redundancy/dismissal/unfair-dismissal/) .

If there is a dispute as to whether a job is suitable, or whether your refusal
is unreasonable, you can bring a claim to the [ Workplace Relations
Commission. ](/en/employment/enforcement-and-redress/workplace-relations-
commission/)
