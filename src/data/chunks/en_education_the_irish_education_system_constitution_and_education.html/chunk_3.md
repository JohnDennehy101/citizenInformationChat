###  The Constitution and education

Article 42 of the Constitution of Ireland says:

"1: The State acknowledges that the primary and natural educator of the child
is the Family and guarantees to respect the inalienable right and duty of
parents to provide, according to their means, for the religious and moral,
intellectual, physical and social education of their children.

2: Parents shall be free to provide this education in their homes or in
private schools or in schools recognised or established by the State.

3.1°:The State shall not oblige parents in violation of their conscience and
lawful preference to send their children to schools established by the State,
or to any particular type of school designated by the State.

3.2°:The State shall, however, as guardian of the common good, require in view
of actual conditions that the children receive a certain minimum education,
moral, intellectual and social.

4:The State shall provide for free primary education and shall endeavour to
supplement and give reasonable aid to private and corporate educational
initiative, and, when the public good requires it, provide other educational
facilities or institutions with due regard, however, for the rights of
parents, especially in the matter of religious and moral formation."
