###  Minimum education

There is no definition of a "minimum education" in the [ Education (Welfare)
Act 2000 ](https://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2000/act/22/enacted/en/html) .
It does say that the Minister can set a "prescribed minimum education". That
minimum standard may be different for children of different ages and of
different abilities - including physical, mental and emotional abilities.
