on the ground of religious profession, belief or status.

2.4°: Legislation providing State aid for schools shall not discriminate
between schools under the management of different religious denominations, nor

receiving public money without attending religious instruction at that school.

2.5°: Every religious denomination shall have the right to manage its own
affairs, own, acquire and administer property, movable and immovable, and
maintain institutions for religious or charitable purposes.
