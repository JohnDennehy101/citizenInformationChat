###  **Equality in education**

Educational establishments in Ireland are subject to the [ Equal Status Acts
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2000/en/act/pub/0008/index.html) , whether
they are publicly funded or not. The Acts require that schools and educational
institutions do not discriminate across any of the nine grounds - gender,
marital status, family status, sexual orientation, religion, age, disability,
race and membership of the Traveller community. There are exemptions in
relation to gender and religion. It is not discrimination if a single gender
school (excluding universities) refuses to admit a student of another gender.

Educational establishments means preschools, primary schools, post-primary
schools, an institution providing adult, continuing or further education, a
university, third level or higher-level institution

You can find an information booklet about [ Schools and the Equal Status Acts
