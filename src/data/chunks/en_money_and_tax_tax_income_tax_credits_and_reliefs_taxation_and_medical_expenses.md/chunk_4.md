####  Must be prescribed

The following healthcare qualifies for tax relief if prescribed by a doctor:

  * Drugs and medicines 
  * Diagnostic procedures 
  * Physiotherapy or similar treatment 
  * Chiropody or podiatry (foot treatments) 
  * Orthoptic or similar treatment (for example, treatments for squints and eye movement disorders) 
  * Home nursing for a serious illness 

These aids and devices qualify for tax relief if prescribed by a doctor:

  * Hearing aid 
  * Orthopaedic bed or chair 
  * Wheelchair or wheelchair lift (no relief is due for alteration to the building to facilitate a lift) 
  * Glucometer machine for a diabetic 
  * A computer needed by someone with a severe disability to help them communicate 

You can also claim for gluten-free food if you have coeliac disease or
diabetic products if you have diabetes. Instead of a prescription, you can use
a letter from a doctor stating that you have coeliac disease or diabetes. You
can use receipts from supermarkets or chemists.

These lists do not include every expense that is eligible. Revenue adds to the
list of treatments and appliances that you can get tax relief on from time to
time. If you are undergoing a new procedure or availing of a new appliance, it
is worth checking whether you can claim tax relief. For more information, see
