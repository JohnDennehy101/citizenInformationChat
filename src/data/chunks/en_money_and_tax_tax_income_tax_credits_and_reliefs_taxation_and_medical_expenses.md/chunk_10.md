on-site nursing care.

You can claim the tax relief for nursing home expenses that you pay for
yourself or for someone else.

higher rate of tax, the higher rate of 40% applies to income that is above the
[ standard rate cut-off point ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/money-
and-tax/tax/income-tax/how-your-tax-is-calculated/#d43041) . The nursing home
expenses you pay are deducted from your total income, reducing the amount of
your income that is taxable at the higher rate. Revenue provides examples of [
