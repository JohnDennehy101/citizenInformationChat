##  Health insurance

If you have [ health insurance ](/en/health/health-system/private-health-
insurance/) , you can get tax relief on the premium you pay to an [ approved
insurer ](https://www.hia.ie/regulation/register-of-health-benefit-
undertakings/ru_list) .

You do not need to claim the relief – it is given as a reduction in the amount
of the insurance premium you pay. This is known as tax relief at source.

However, in some situations tax relief at source does not apply, for example,
where an employer pays the medical insurance premiums on behalf of an
employee. This is treated as a Benefit in Kind and tax is due on the total
amount.

This means that the employee does not get the tax relief at source on the
insurance premium. You can instead [ make a claim directly to Revenue
](https://www.revenue.ie/en/personal-tax-credits-reliefs-and-
exemptions/health-and-age/medical-insurance-premiums/index.aspx) .

The relief is given at the rate of 20% of the cost. This is up to a maximum of
€1,000 per adult and €500 per child. A child is someone under 21 years of age
that a child premium has been paid for.
