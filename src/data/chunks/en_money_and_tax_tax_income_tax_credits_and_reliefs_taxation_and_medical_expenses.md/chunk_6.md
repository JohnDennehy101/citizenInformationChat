##  Travelling abroad for treatment

You can claim tax relief on the cost of medical treatment you get outside
Ireland. The healthcare provider must be entitled to practise in the country
where the care is provided.

If the qualifying healthcare is only available outside Ireland, you can also
claim for reasonable travel and accommodation expenses. If you need someone to
go with you because of your medical condition, their expenses may be covered
(for one accompanying person).

If your child needs to travel for treatment, the expenses of both parents may
be allowed in special cases where it is necessary for you both to be with the
child.
