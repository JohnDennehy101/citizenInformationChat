##  COVID-19 and pregnancy

If you are pregnant and think you may have been exposed to COVID-19, contact
your GP. Most women who test positive and have mild symptoms can safely self-
isolate at home (7 days). Routine antenatal or ultrasound appointments should
be postponed until after the period of self-isolation.

Pregnant women who have COVID-19 should only attend the hospital if in need of
urgent medical or obstetric care. It is important to phone the hospital in
advance of coming to make sure you are seen at the right place by the right
medical team.

If you have not had any COVID-19 vaccines, you can get your first round of
COVID-19 vaccination or first booster at any stage of your pregnancy.

If you had a booster dose during your current pregnancy, then a second booster
dose is not needed.

If you had a booster dose before this pregnancy, you can get your second
booster at or after 16 weeks of your pregnancy.

pregnancy, you can [ read the HSEâ€™s information booklet (pdf)
