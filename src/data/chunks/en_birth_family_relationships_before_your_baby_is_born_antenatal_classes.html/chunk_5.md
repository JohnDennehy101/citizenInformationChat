##  Choosing an antenatal class

If you are unsure about which antenatal class to attend, talk to your
maternity hospital, GP, midwife or public health nurse. They can offer you
guidance on what class would suit your specific needs.

Some antenatal classes focus on labour and the birth, while others include a
variety of topics. Some classes are tailored to parents with specific needs,
such as lone parents, teenagers, or parents having twins or multiple births.

If you have previously had a [ caesarean birth
](https://www2.hse.ie/wellbeing/child-health/caesarean-birth/overview-of-
caesarean-birth.html) but now wish to have a vaginal birth, many hospitals and
services offer vaginal birth after caesarean (VBAC) antenatal classes.

**When to start your antenatal classes**

Most formal antenatal classes start when you are between [ 26-32 weeks
pregnant ](https://www2.hse.ie/wellbeing/child-health/25-to-28-weeks-
pregnant.html) .

If you are [ expecting twins ](https://www2.hse.ie/wellbeing/child-
health/expecting-twins-and-multiple-pregnancies.html) (or any multiple
births), consider starting your antenatal classes early. Your babies may
arrive before their due date.

You should book your preferred classes as early as possible. You can [ find
