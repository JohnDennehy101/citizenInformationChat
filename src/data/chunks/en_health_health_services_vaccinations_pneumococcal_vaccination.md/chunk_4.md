##  Pneumococcal vaccine

The pneumococcal vaccine can help to protect you against pneumococcal disease.
When you get the pneumococcal vaccine, your immune system will start to
produce antibodies. Then, if you come into contact with the bacteria, these
antibodies will fight it and stop you from getting sick.

You cannot get pneumococcal disease from the vaccine.

There are 2 types of pneumococcal vaccine available in Ireland.

  * PCV13 vaccine 
  * PPV23 vaccine

The first type of vaccine is called ‘Pneumococcal conjugate vaccine’ (PCV13),

(PPV23). You should get the PPV23 vaccine if you are:
