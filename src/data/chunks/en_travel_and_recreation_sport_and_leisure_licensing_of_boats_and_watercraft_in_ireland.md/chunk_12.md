###  Radio licence regulation

The licensing of maritime radio systems is regulated by the Wireless
Telegraphy Act, 1926. Every ship that has a radio system installed must also
carry a Ship Radio Licence.

While owners of recreational craft, (yachts, sail cruisers and motor cruisers
etc.) are not required to install a radio system, nevertheless if they opt to
install a radio system on a voluntary basis, they must also carry a Ship Radio
Licence on board.

Ship Radio Licences are issued by the MRAU. An applicant for a licence must
submit the technical details of the radio equipment installed on the vessel.
