##  Introduction

The [ Multi-Unit Developments Act 2011
](http://www.lawreform.ie/_fileupload/RevisedActs/WithAnnotations/HTML/en_act_2011_0002.htm)
regulates the ownership and management of the common areas of multi-unit
developments. The Act provides that before a developer sells any units:

  * An owners' management company must be set up, and 
  * The common areas of the development must be transferred to the owners' management company 

A multi-unit development is a development of at least 5 residential units that
share facilities, amenities and services. Multi-unit developments can also be
known as managed estates.

The majority of multi-unit developments are apartment blocks, but groups of
houses that share common facilities and have an ownersâ€™ management company are
also covered by this term. The Multi-Unit Developments Act 2011 also details
some rules for developments with between 2 and 4 residential units. And to a
certain extent, the Act applies to mixed commercial and residential
developments.
