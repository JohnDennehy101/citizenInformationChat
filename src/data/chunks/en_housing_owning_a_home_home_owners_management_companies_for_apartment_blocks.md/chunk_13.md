####  **Sinking fund**

The owners’ management company must establish a sinking fund within 3 years of
being transferred ownership of the development. The sinking fund is used for
spending on refurbishment, improvement or maintenance of a non-recurring
nature in a multi-unit development. Unit owners must make contributions to the
sinking fund (including developers in the case of unsold units). The 2011 Act
provides that the amount to be contributed to the sinking fund is €200
annually per unit, or such other amount as the members agree. Contributions to
the sinking fund must be held in a separate account.
