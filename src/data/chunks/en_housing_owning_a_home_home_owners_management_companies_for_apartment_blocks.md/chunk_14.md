####  **House rules**

The owners’ management company can make house rules for the effective
operation and maintenance of the multi-unit development. These rules must be
agreed by a meeting of members but the first set of rules can be made by the
company before the sale of the first unit. If a unit is let to tenants, one of
the terms of the letting should state that tenants must observe the house
rules. You can download a sample of house rules from the [ FAQ
](https://www.housingagency.ie/node/291#accordion-645513908) section on the
Housing Agency’s website.
