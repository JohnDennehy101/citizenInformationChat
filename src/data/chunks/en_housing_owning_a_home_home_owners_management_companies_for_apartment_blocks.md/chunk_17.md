##  What is a property management agent?

A property management agent is hired by an owners’ management company to
provide services to manage an estate, for example, refuse collection, repairs
and maintenance. Generally, people living in a multi-unit development have
more contact with the agent than with their owners' management company, as the
agent looks after the day-to-day running of the estate. The roles of the
owners’ management company and the property management agent are separate, and
the details of the relationship between them are set-out in a contract or
letter of engagement.

The agent follows the instructions of the board of directors of the owners’
management company and is accountable to them for the standard of services
provided. An agent can be involved in the management of a number of different
estates and can work for a number of different owners’ management companies.
Agents are [ regulated by the Property Services Regulatory Authority
