####  **Register of members**

You automatically become a member of an owners’ management company when you
purchase a home in a multi-unit development. The owners’ management company
must give anyone who buys a residential unit a share or membership
certificate.

The company must update the register of members with the buyer’s details. The
register of members is a list of the names and addresses of all of the members
of the company. It is required under company law and must be kept at the
company’s registered office and made available for public inspection. The
members must keep the company informed of any relevant changes. If a unit is
let to a tenant, the owner must provide the owners’ management company with
the tenant’s details. Read more about [ landlords’ rights and obligations
