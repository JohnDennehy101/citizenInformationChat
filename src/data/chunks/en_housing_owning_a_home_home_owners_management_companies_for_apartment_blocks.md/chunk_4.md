###  What are a developer's obligations in a multi-unit development?

Before any unit in a multi-unit development can be sold, the developer must:

  * Establish an owners’ management company 
  * Transfer the common areas of the development to the owners' management company at the developer's expense 
  * Enter into a contract with the owners' management company which outlines the responsibility of the developer to the owner’s management company and vice versa. The contract should deal with issues such as compliance with statutory requirements, completion of the common areas (for which the developer remains responsible), retention money (usually, money retained by the company to ensure that the developer completes the project) and dispute resolution. (The owners’ management company must have separate legal representation in the negotiation of the contract.) 
  * Supply a certificate under the Building Control Acts from a suitably qualified person regarding compliance with fire safety in the development. The [ Multi-Unit Developments Act 2011 (Section 3) (Prescribed Persons) Regulations 2011 ](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2011/en/si/0096.html) specify that suitably qualified people are architects, building surveyors and chartered engineers. 
  * Do all things that are reasonably necessary to ensure that the unit owner enjoys the rights and amenities necessary for the reasonable use and peaceful occupation of the units.
