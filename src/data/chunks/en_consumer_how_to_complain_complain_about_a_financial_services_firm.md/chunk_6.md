###  Make a formal complaint

If you are not successful in resolving your complaint informally, then you
should complain formally (in writing). Contact details should be available
from the firm or by looking at their website. If you already have the
complaints handling procedure, the contact details will be included there.

There are detailed rules in the Consumer Protection Code about how often a
company should contact you to keep you updated on your complaint. You must
give the firm 40 working days to resolve your complaint. If they don't resolve
your complaint, they must give you a final response letter, setting out the
steps they have taken.

If, after 40 working days, your complaint has not been resolved and you have
not received a final response letter, you can then ask the FSPO to follow up
on your behalf to get a final response letter – see ‘How do I take my
complaint further’ below.

The Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC) has a [ 3-step plan
to making a complaint about financial services providers

services-providers/) .
