##  What you should know before you complain

Under the Central Bank’s [ Consumer Protection Code
](https://www.centralbank.ie/docs/default-
source/tns/contact/codes/tns-5-3-2-consumer-protection-code.pdf?sfvrsn=4) ,
all regulated financial services firms must:

  * Handle your complaint speedily, efficiently and fairly 
  * Have a written complaints handling procedure in place 
  * Give you details of a dedicated contact person who will deal with your complaint 
  * Respond to you and keep you updated about your complaint within certain timelines 
  * Resolve your complaint within 40 working days 

The Central Bank has published a [ consumer guide to the Consumer Protection
Code (pdf) ](https://www.centralbank.ie/docs/default-
source/regulation/industry-market-sectors/brokers-retail-
intermediaries/guidance/consumer-protection-code-v4.pdf?sfvrsn=4) . The Code
rules on complaints handling do not apply if firm has resolved your complaint
within 5 working days.

The firm’s complaints handling procedure tells you:

  * Who you should talk to or write to 
  * When you should expect a reply 
  * What to do if you are not satisfied with the answer you get 

You should be able to find a copy of the firm’s complaints procedure online.
If you can’t find it, contact the firm by phone or email and ask for it.
