##  How do I take my complaint further?

If you are not happy with the company’s response, they reject your complaint
or you do not hear from them within 40 working days, the Financial Services
and Pensions Ombudsman (FSPO) may be able to help you.

The FSPO is an independent officer who investigates, mediates and adjudicates
unresolved complaints about financial services firms and pension providers.

The FSPO will only take on a case after you have gone through the normal
complaints process with the company and have the final response letter.
