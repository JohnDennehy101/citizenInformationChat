##  Home schooling

You have a constitutional right to educate your child at home. The [ Irish
Constitution ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/education/the-irish-
education-system/constitution-and-education/) recognises the family as the
primary educator of the child and defines the duties and responsibilities for
parents and the State in the education of children.

If you choose to teach your child at home, often called home schooling or home
education, you do not need a formal teaching qualification. You do not need to
follow the national curriculum, but you must ensure that your child receives a
certain minimum education.

You can choose a suitable approach to teaching your child based on their
learning needs and what is appropriate to their age, aptitude and ability.
