###  Register with Tusla

You must register your child with Tusla if you plan to teach them at home.

If your child attends an independent school, you should apply to register them
through the school. Registration is a legal obligation, but it is not
automatic. Parents or guardians are responsible for making an application on
behalf of their child. See ‘Registering to teach your child at home’ below.
