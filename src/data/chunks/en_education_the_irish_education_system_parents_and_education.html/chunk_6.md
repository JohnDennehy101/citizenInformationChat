##  Registering to teach your child at home

You [ apply directly to Tusla's Alternative Education Assessment and
Registration Service (AEARS) ](https://www.tusla.ie/services/family-community-
support/alternative-education-assessment-and-registration-service/) to
register to teach your child at home.

AEARS can send you an application form and a copy of the [ Guidelines on the
assessment of education in places other than recognised schools (pdf)
](https://www.tusla.ie/uploads/content/guidelines_assessment_education_outside_schools.pdf)
. You can find more in [ frequently asked questions
](https://www.tusla.ie/uploads/content/AEARS-
GDE01.2_Home_Education_Frequently_Asked_Questions_.pdf) .

Tusla then assesses your application to register.

**Tusla interview and assessment**

When you return the application form, the person who will carry out the
assessment will contact you. They will arrange a time and date to interview
you. This assessor is experienced in education and is authorised by Tusla to
carry out the assessment.

The assessment will focus on:

  * The details of the education being provided to your child 
  * The materials used in the course of the education 
  * The time spent providing the education 

The interview can take place in a venue of your choice and will be based on
what you have said in your application. This is called the **preliminary
assessment** . Your assessor will complete a draft assessment report and a
copy of this will be forwarded to you for comment. Following the report, your
childâ€™s name will either be entered into the register or your case will be
referred for a comprehensive assessment.

If Tusla is not able to decide whether you are providing a minimum education,
a **comprehensive assessment** will be carried out. This is more in-depth. The
assessor spends some time with you, observing how you teach or work with your
child, inspecting your educational materials and talking to your child.
