##  Where to apply

**From 1 January 2014, the Mortgage Interest Supplement scheme is closed to
new entrants and no new applications will be accepted from this date.** This
measure does not affect current claimants immediately (people who were getting
Mortgage Interest Supplement before 1 January 2014). The scheme will be wound
down for existing claimants over a 4-year period.

Contact the [ Community Welfare Officer ](/en/social-welfare/supplementary-
welfare-schemes/community-welfare-services-and-payments/) at your local Intreo
office.
