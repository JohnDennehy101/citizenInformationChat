###  Main income disregards

The following items are not taken into account as income for calculating
Mortgage Interest Supplement:

  * [ Child Benefit ](/en/social-welfare/families-and-children/child-benefit/)
  * [ Mobility Allowance ](/en/travel-and-recreation/transport-and-disability/mobility-allowance/)
  * Foster care payments from the Health Service Executive (HSE) 
  * Payments for accommodating children under the Child Care Act 
  * Income from Gaeltacht students 
  * Grants or allowances from schemes promoting the welfare of blind people 
  * Money received from charitable organisations, for example, St Vincent de Paul 
  * Compensation awarded by the Compensation Tribunal in respect of Hepatitis C contracted from certain blood products, to those who have disabilities caused by Thalidomide and to those receiving compensation under the Residential Institutions Redress Board 
  * Maintenance grant paid by SUSI 
  * [ Domiciliary Care Allowance ](/en/social-welfare/disability-and-illness/domiciliary-care-allowance/)
  * [ Cares Support Grant ](/en/social-welfare/carers/carers-support-grant/)
  * Guardian's Payment (Contributory) and Guardian's Payment (Non-Contributory) 
  * **Pensioners:** If you are aged 65 or over (or where one of a couple is of pensionable age) and have a combined household income greater than the rate of SWA appropriate to your household circumstances, the difference between the maximum rate of [ State Pension (Contributory) ](/en/social-welfare/older-and-retired-people/state-pension-contributory/) appropriate to your circumstance and the rate of SWA appropriate to your circumstances is not taken into account. 
  * **Carers' payments:** The [ half-rate Carer's Allowance ](/en/social-welfare/carers/half-rate-carers-allowance/) is never taken into account. 
  * If you are getting [ Carer's Allowance ](/en/social-welfare/carers/carers-allowance/) , the amount of Carer's Allowance above the appropriate SWA rate for your situation (either the adult dependent rate for a couple or the personal rate of SWA) is not taken into account. So if you are one of a **couple** and getting Carer's Allowance the amount of Carer's Allowance being paid less the SWA adult dependent rate is not taken into account and if you are **single or a lone parent** the amount disregarded is the rate of Carer's Allowance being paid less the personal rate of SWA. 
  * Any amount of [ Carer's Benefit ](/en/social-welfare/carers/carers-benefit/) in excess of the basic SWA rate for your situation (either the adult dependent rate or the personal rate of SWA) is not taken into account. 

Income from working as a home help with the HSE used to be disregarded for all
social assistance payments but from January 2012 this income is taken into
account.
