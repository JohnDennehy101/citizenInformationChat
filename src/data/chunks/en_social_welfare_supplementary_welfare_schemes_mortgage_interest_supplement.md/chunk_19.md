####  **Household income disregard**

A certain amount of your household income above the appropriate SWA rate is
not taken into account:

  * €75 of any _additional household income_ is not taken into account 
  * 25% of _additional household income_ over €75 is not taken into account 

There is no upper limit on the amount that can be disregarded.

_Additional household income_ is income from part-time employment or part-time
self-employment, Working Family Payment, Community Employment (CE), Back to
Enterprise Allowance.

Maintenance, except child maintenance, is also assessed as additional
household income (see ‘Maintenance and Mortgage Interest Supplement’ below).
