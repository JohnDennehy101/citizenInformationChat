####  **Rehabilitative earnings disregard**

A certain amount of your income from rehabilitative work is not taken into
account.

If you are getting Disability Allowance or Blind Pension, €120 from
rehabilitative training or employment is not taken into account in the
assessment for Mortgage Interest Supplement.

Any earnings over €120 from rehabilitative training or employment will affect
your Mortgage Interest Supplement. If you are earning above €120, you can be
assessed using whichever disregard is most in your interest: either the
_Rehabilitative earnings disregard_ or the _Household income disregard_ (but
not both).
