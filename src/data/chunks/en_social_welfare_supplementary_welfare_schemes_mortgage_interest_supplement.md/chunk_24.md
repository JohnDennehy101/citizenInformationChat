##  Income disregards before June 2007

The income disregards set out above came into effect on 5 June 2007. Claims
made before 5 June 2007 were assessed using the old income disregards (see
below).

Existing claims were reviewed and assessed using both the new and old income
disregards. People who would get more using the old income disregards
continued to be assessed using those rules until they had a change in
circumstances which triggered a review (such as a change in household income,
or a break in their claim for more than 13 weeks).
