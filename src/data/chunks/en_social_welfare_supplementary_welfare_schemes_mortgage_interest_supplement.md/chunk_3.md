###  **Closed to new applicants**

Since 1 January 2014, the Mortgage Interest Supplement scheme is closed to new
entrants. No new applications have been accepted since this date.

This closure did not affect people who were getting Mortgage Interest
Supplement before 1 January 2014. The scheme was wound down for these
claimants over a 4-year period and it closed on 31 December 2017.

However, claimants who were getting MIS payments that were due to end on that
date **continue to get payments under the** [ **Supplementary Welfare
Allowance** ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/social-
welfare-payments/supplementary-welfare-schemes/supplementary-welfare-allow/)
**from 1 January 2018** .

The amount you get is equal to the MIS payment you were getting before 31
December 2017. This payment is made automatically, so you donâ€™t need to re-
apply to the Department of Social Protection.
