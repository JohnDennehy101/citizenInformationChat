In its [ final report (pdf)
](http://www.constitutionalconvention.ie/AttachmentDownload.ashx?mid=55f2ba29-aab8-e311-a7ce-005056a32ee4)
in 2014, the Convention recommended that a similar convention be created to
address additional issues.

constitution-1/citizens-assembly/) was set up to consider further legal and
policy issues facing Irish society. This was another exercise in deliberative
democracy.
