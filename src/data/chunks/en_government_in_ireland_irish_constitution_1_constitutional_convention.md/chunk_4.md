##  How did the Constitutional Convention work?

The Constitutional Convention used the model of [ deliberative democracy (pdf)
](https://www.ucd.ie/t4cms/CASE_STUDY8_David Farrell.pdf) , in which citizens
participate directly in decision-making. Deliberative democracy involves:

  * Random selection of ordinary citizens, who are provided with objective information 
  * Expert presentations for participants to listen to and question 
  * Facilitated small-group discussions about policy issues 
  * Recommendations fed into the political process 

The Conventionâ€™s work was guided by five key principles:

  * Openness 
  * Fairness 
  * Equality of voice 
  * Efficiency 
  * Collegiality
