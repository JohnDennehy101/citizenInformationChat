###  Pregnant or recently given birth

If you are pregnant you can qualify for Health and Safety Benefit if you are:

  * Exposed to _certain risks_ in the workplace or 
  * A night worker 

If you are breastfeeding, you can qualify if you are exposed to certain risks
in the workplace. This only applies when you are breastfeeding in the first 26
weeks after the birth.

If you have given birth in the last 14 weeks, you can qualify if you are a
night worker.

A **night worker** works for at least 3 hours of their normal shift between
11pm and 6am, or at least 25% of their monthly hours are between 11pm and 6am.
