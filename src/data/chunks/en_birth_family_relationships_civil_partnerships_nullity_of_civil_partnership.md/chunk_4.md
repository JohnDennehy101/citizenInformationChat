##  What are the consequences of nullity?

The most obvious consequence of a court declaration of nullity is that you are
now entitled to marry.

If you had already married or entered into a new civil partnership* before an
order of annulment was made by the court, your new marriage or civil
partnership may have appeared invalid. However, once the annulment order is
granted in respect of the earlier civil partnership, your later marriage or
civil partnership is validated, as your first civil partnership has now been
declared invalid.

If your civil partnership is annulled, it also means that you lose the rights
that you had as a civil partner. This means:

  * The home that you shared with your former partner is no longer a shared home. If your former partner is the legal owner of the house, they can sell or lease it without your consent. 
  * Under the [ Succession Act 1965 ](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1965/act/27/enacted/en/html) , when a civil partner dies, the surviving civil partner is legally entitled to a share of their estate whether or not they have left a will. As your civil partnership never happened, you do not have any succession rights if your former partner dies. 
  * If your civil partnership has been annulled, you do not have a right to apply to the court to order your former partner to pay maintenance to support you, as only civil partners may apply to a court for an order for maintenance. 
  * A court can also make orders in relation to the unfitness (or unsuitability) of one the former partners to have custody in respect of any dependent child. 

***Since 16 November 2015, you can no longer register a civil partnership.
Couples already in a civil partnership can apply to marry or remain as they
are in the civil partnership.**
