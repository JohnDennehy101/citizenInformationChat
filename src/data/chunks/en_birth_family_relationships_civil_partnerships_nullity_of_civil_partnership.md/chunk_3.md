##  How to apply for an annulment

To get an annulment (decree of nullity) of your alleged civil partnership, you
must make an application to the [ Circuit Court ](/en/justice/courts-
system/circuit-court/) or the [ High Court ](/en/justice/courts-system/high-
court/) .

The court can grant an annulment for the following reasons:

  * At the time of the registration of the civil partnership there was a lack of capacity. In other words, you or your partner was incapable of entering into a binding civil partnership contract. This may happen: 

\- if one of you was already validly married or in a civil partnership

\- if you were too closely related to each other

\- if you were of opposite biological sex

\- if one of you was under 18 years of age

  * The formal requirements for the registration of a civil partnership were not followed. For example, you did not give due notice to the civil registrar. 
  * At the time of the registration of the civil partnership, there was a lack of consent. In other words, you or your partner did not give free and fully informed consent to the civil partnership. This may be due to duress, for example, you were forced into the civil partnership. It may also be due to the fact that you or your partner was suffering from a mental illness at that time. 

If the court decides that your civil partnership is void for whatever reason,
it will then declare that your civil partnership never existed.

Technically, if your civil partnership never took place, then there is no need
to go to court to get a decree of annulment - you may simply act as though the
civil partnership never happened. However, it is advisable to get a court
order declaring that your civil partnership is annulled in order to remove any
doubt.
