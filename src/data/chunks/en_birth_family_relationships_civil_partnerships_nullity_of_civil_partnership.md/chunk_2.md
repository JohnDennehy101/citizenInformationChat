##  What is nullity?

A decree of nullity is a declaration by a court that your civil partnership is
void and never existed in the eyes of the law. It means no valid civil
partnership ever existed between you and your partner. Nullity is more
commonly referred to as an annulment.

A civil partnership may be void because some defect or impediment existed when
the civil partnership was registered, for example, if one of you was under 18
years old at the time the civil partnership was registered.

Nullity is not the same as dissolution. Nullity is a declaration that a valid
civil partnership **never existed** in the first place. Dissolution is a
declaration ending a **valid** civil partnership.
