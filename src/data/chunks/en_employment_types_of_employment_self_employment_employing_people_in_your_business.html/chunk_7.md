###  **Occupational pensions**

You do not have to provide a [ pension scheme for employees
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/money-and-tax/personal-
finance/pensions/occupational-pensions/) (often called ‘occupational
pensions’).

However, if you do not offer an occupational pension scheme, or if certain
restrictions apply to your scheme, you must give your employees access to at
least one standard [ Personal Retirement Savings Account (PRSA)
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/money-and-tax/personal-
finance/pensions/personal-retirement-savings-accounts/) .
