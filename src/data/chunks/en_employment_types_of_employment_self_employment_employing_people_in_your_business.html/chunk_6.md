###  **Deducting tax**

You must deduct tax from your employee’s wages through the Pay As You Earn
(PAYE) system, and then pay this to Revenue using the [ Revenue Online Service
](https://www.ros.ie/) .

The amount of tax you deduct depends on the amount of income they earn and on
their personal circumstances. Read about [ how income tax is calculated
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/money-and-tax/tax/income-tax/how-your-
tax-is-calculated/) .

Tax deductions include:

  * Income Tax 
  * [ Pay-Related Social Insurance (PRSI) ](https://www.revenue.ie/en/employing-people/paying-your-employees-tax-to-revenue/prsi.aspx)
  * [ Universal Social Charge (USC) ](https://www.revenue.ie/en/jobs-and-pensions/usc/index.aspx)
  * [ Local Property Tax ](https://www.revenue.ie/en/property/index.aspx) (if applicable) 

You must deduct tax on or before the date you pay your employee. You must then
[ report the pay and deductions to Revenue
](https://www.revenue.ie/en/employing-people/becoming-an-employer-and-ongoing-
obligations/information-on-payroll-submission/index.aspx) .

Remember to [ give employees a payslip
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/employment/employment-rights-and-
conditions/pay-and-employment/pay-slip/) with every payment of their wages.
The payslip should set out the worker’s gross pay and any deductions from that
pay.

their new employment with Revenue.
