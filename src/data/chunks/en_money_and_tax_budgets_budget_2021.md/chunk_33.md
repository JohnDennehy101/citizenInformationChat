###  COVID-19 supports

The [ Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme ](/en/employment/unemployment-and-
redundancy/employment-wage-subsidy-scheme/) will continue until 31 March 2021.
Supports under a similar scheme are likely to continue from 1 April 2021. The
Government has applied to the EU SURE fund (the European Instrument for
Temporary Support to Mitigate Unemployment Risks) for additional funding. This
fund is part of the European response to help protect jobs and workers
affected by COVID-19.

Any employer who received excess amounts of the **Temporary Wage Subsidy
Scheme** must refund the overpayment to Revenue. An employer may be unable to
repay the overpayment immediately, due to the impact of Covid-19 on their
business, and the existing tax debt warehousing scheme will be expanded to
include these repayments.

The **Covid Enterprise Support Grant payments** have been extended until 31
March 2021. The grant is worth up to €1,000 and is aimed at sole traders who
got the Government’s Restart Grant Plus.

The **waiving of commercial rates** due to local authorities has been extended
until the end of 2020 to support businesses impacted by COVID-19.

Other COVID-19 supports include:

  * €39 million in continued access to low cost loans for business 
  * €30 million for applied research in the pharmaceutical and healthcare industry 
  * €10 million to help businesses move online with the Online Retail Scheme
