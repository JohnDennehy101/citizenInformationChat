###  Supports for homeless people

Funding of €218 million has been made available for homeless services in
2021\. This will support local authorities providing emergency accommodation
and other services and help people to exit homelessness to tenancies as
quickly as possible.

€38 million is allocated to the **Local Infrastructure Housing Activation
Fund** to support the provision of infrastructure to facilitate the delivery
of private, social and affordable homes.
