###  Motor tax

A third rate of [ motor tax ](/en/travel-and-recreation/motoring/motor-tax-
and-insurance/motor-tax-rates/) is being introduced for cars registered from 1
January 2021 to take account of the introduction of the ‘Worldwide Harmonised
Light Vehicle Testing Procedure’ (WLTP).

Minor changes will apply to the existing rates table for cars taxed on **CO2
emissions** (cars first registered between July 2008 and end 2020). Pre-2008
cars, which do not have CO2 emissions information, will continue to be taxed
according to engine size. There are no changes to the rates table for these
cars.
