##  How do I separate my rubbish at home?

Waste collecting companies usually have a colour-coded system for separating
household waste, for example:

  * Brown bins for organic waste 
  * Green bins for recyclable waste 
  * Black bins are for general waste 

Some companies may also offer a glass recycling collection.
