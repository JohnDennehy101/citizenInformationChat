##  Reporting a concern

Safeguarding is about putting measures in place to help people who might be at
risk to protect themselves from harm or abuse. The HSE has [ Safeguarding and
Protection Teams
](https://www.hse.ie/eng/about/who/socialcare/safeguardingvulnerableadults/safeguarprotectteams.html)
in every region of the country. These teams are responsible for adult
safeguarding within services for older people and services for people with
disabilities. Contact your nearest [ HSE Safeguarding and Protection Team
](https://www.hse.ie/eng/about/who/socialcare/safeguardingvulnerableadults/safeguarprotectteams.html)
if you, or someone you know, is a victim of abuse.

Alternatively, contact your [ local health centre
](http://www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/2/healthcentres/) , your GP, [ public
health nurse ](/en/health/health-services/care-in-your-community/public-
health-nurses/) or the [ Garda Síochana
](http://www.garda.ie/Stations/Default.aspx) and talk to someone about what
has been happening.

You can also contact the HSE Information Line on 1800 700 700. Or, if
confidentiality is required, phone the Garda confidential line on 1800 666
111.

**In an emergency, where a person is at immediate risk, you should contact the
Garda Síochana or Emergency Services on 999 or 112.**
