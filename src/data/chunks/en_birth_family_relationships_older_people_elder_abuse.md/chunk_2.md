##  What is elder abuse?

Abuse can take place in any situation and any person is at risk. A vulnerable
person is someone who may be restricted in capacity to guard themselves
against harm or exploitation or to report such harm or exploitation.

Abuse can be perpetrated (carried out) by a range of people, such as
strangers, institutions, or family members. It may happen when an older person
or a person with a disability lives alone or with a relative. It may also
happen in residential or day-care settings, in hospitals, home support
services and other places assumed to be safe, or in public places.

Elder abuse is the abuse of someone aged 65 or over and it happens in a
relationship where there is an expectation of trust. Elder abuse can be a
single or repeated act, or a lack of action, which causes harm or distress to
the older person, or that violates their human and civil rights.
