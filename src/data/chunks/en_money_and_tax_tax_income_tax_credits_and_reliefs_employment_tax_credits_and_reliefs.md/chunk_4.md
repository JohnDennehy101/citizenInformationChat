##  Benefits from employment

In Ireland, most benefits from employment that are provided in addition to pay
are subject to income tax. This also applies to benefits-in-kind.

Benefits-in-kind are benefits received by an employee that cannot be converted
into cash but that have a cash value. Examples include provision of a company
car, loans given at a special rate or provision of accommodation. Some
benefits-in-kind are exempt from tax or can be received tax efficiently.
