##  Expenses

Some work expenses can be deducted from your income before it is assessed for
tax. To qualify, the expenses must have been necessary in order to do your
work and must have been spent entirely for that purpose and no other.

A mileage allowance that you receive for the use of your car for business
purposes is not taxable if it does not exceed the [ civil service mileage
rates ](https://www.revenue.ie/en/employing-people/employee-expenses/travel-
and-subsistence/civil-service-rates.aspx) .

There is no tax relief on expenses for getting to or from work.

The [ Bike to Work Scheme ](/en/travel-and-recreation/cycling/cycle-to-work-
scheme/) is a tax incentive scheme which aims to encourage employees to cycle
to and from work. Under the scheme employers can pay for bicycles and bicycle
equipment for their employees and the employee pays back through a salary
sacrifice arrangement of up to 12 months. The employee is not liable for tax,
PRSI or the Universal Social Charge on their repayments.

See Revenue for [ more details on expenses that can be deducted
](http://www.revenue.ie/en/tax/it/employee-expenses.html) for tax purposes
including _flat-rate expenses_ . Flat-rate expenses are directly related to
the nature of the employment. A standard [ flat rate expenses allowance
(deduction) (pdf) ](https://www.revenue.ie/en/personal-tax-credits-reliefs-
and-exemptions/documents/flat-rate-expenses.pdf) is set for various classes of
employee. The agreed deduction is then applied to all employees of the class
or group in question.
