###  Uisce Éireann and local authorities

Uisce Éireann is responsible for maintaining the public water supplies and
ensuring the quality of the water it distributes. Local authorities are the
supervisory authority for the water quality of private water supplies that are
monitored under the Regulations. They also perform certain functions on behalf
of Uisce Éireann under service level agreements. See our document on [ Water
supply ](/ga/housing/water-and-coasts/water-supply/) .

If a water supply constitutes a danger to human health, Uisce Éireann must
take action to protect public health. It does this in consultation with and
with the agreement of the HSE. It may issue a ‘Drinking Water Restriction
Notice’. Alternatively it may issue a ‘Boil Water Notice’, warning that the
water supply is not safe for human consumption unless boiled first. It must
ensure that the public are made aware of the dangers as soon as possible.

Má fhaigheann tú d’uisce ón bpríomhlíonra poiblí agus má tá amhras ort faoina
cháilíocht, d’fhéadfadh sé gur easnaimh i do chóras pluiméireachta féin é sin.
Más amhlaidh, tá tú freagrach as an fhadhb a réiteach. Tá grúpscéim uisce a
fhaigheann uisce ón bpríomhlíonra poiblí freagrach freisin as a threalamh féin
a chothabháil.

However, if the problem is with the public mains system, this is the
responsibility of Uisce Éireann, which works with local authorities to respond
to emergencies relating to water mains leaks and pollution incidents.
