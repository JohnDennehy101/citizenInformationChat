##  Third Optional Protocol

The [ Optional Protocol on a communications procedure (pdf)
](https://www.ohchr.org/en/professionalinterest/pages/opiccrc.aspx) came into
effect in Ireland on 24 December 2014.

This Protocol allows individual children, or those acting on their behalf, to
submit complaints about specific violations of their rights under the
Convention and its first two Optional Protocols directly to the Committee on
the Rights of the Child.

A decision by the Committee on a complaint is non-binding (not legally
enforceable) on a country. However, as a party to the UN Convention on the
Rights of the Child, Ireland is answerable to the United Nations for its
implementation of the Convention.
