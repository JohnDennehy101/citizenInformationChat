###  **Deferral of day service placement**

If you are a young person with disabilities leaving school or rehabilitative
training, you can defer your placement in a day service for up to 5 years.
This means that you can explore other options while keeping your place in a
day service.

This 5-year deferral is available to all young people due to leave school or
rehabilitative training in 2024, and people who are already currently
deferred.
