##  Introduction

Day centres or day care centres in Ireland provide a range of social and
rehabilitative services for older people and people with disabilities.

Day centres include centres that provide day activities, such as recreational
and leisure facilities, and specialised clinic facilities that provide a
combination of medical and rehabilitation services. Availability of services
varies in different areas. Some day centres are provided directly by the [
Health Service Executive ](http://hse.ie) (HSE) and some are provided by other
organisations on behalf of the HSE.

Access to day centres is by referral and the eligibility conditions vary from
area to area.
