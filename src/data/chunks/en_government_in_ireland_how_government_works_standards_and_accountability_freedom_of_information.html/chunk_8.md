##  How to make an FOI request

Before you apply, you should check if the information you want to get is
publicly available already. Many FOI bodies publish detailed information on
their websites. You may also be able to get the information you need by
speaking to their FOI officer, or another member of staff.

If you decide to make making an application, you should:

  1. Check if there is an FOI form on the FOI body’s website (you don’t have to use a form, but it may make the application easier). Check also the address to make an FOI request. Some organisations have regional FOI officers. 
  2. Complete the form, or (if there is no form) write a letter, or email, and state that you are making the request under the [ Freedom of Information Act 2014 ](https://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2014/act/30/enacted/en/html)
  3. Make your request as specific as possible and give as much information as you can to help the FOI body find the records you need. If you are seeking personal information, enclose a copy of identification.
