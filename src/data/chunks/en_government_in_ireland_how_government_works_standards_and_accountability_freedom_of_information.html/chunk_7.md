###  Records that are exempt

Some types of records are exempt from FOI. Exemptions are either mandatory or
discretionary. For discretionary exemptions, the FOI body should try to
balance the public interest against any harm that releasing the records could
cause.

The following are some examples of records that may be exempt from FOI:

  * National security and international relations 
  * Meetings of the Government 
  * Information that was given in confidence or commercially sensitive information 
  * Personal information (of someone other than the requester)
