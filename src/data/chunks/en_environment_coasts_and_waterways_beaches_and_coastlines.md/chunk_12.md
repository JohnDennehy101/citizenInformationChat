###  **Can I walk my dog on a beach in Ireland?**

Not all beaches are dog-friendly and some may have restrictions. Some beaches
may:

  * Allow dogs at certain times only 
  * Allow dogs which are kept on leads 
  * Not allow dogs at any time 

You should check the beach’s [ local authority website
](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/942f74-local-authorities/) before visiting
to check if there are any restrictions in place.

Dogs are not allowed on some Blue Flag beach areas during the bathing season,
which runs from 1 June to 15 September each year). This is because bathing
water can be contaminated by dog poo. Put your dog poo in the bin when you are
at the beach. If you cannot find a public bin or it is full, bring your litter
home.

You have to keep your dog under control on nearby parking areas, walkways and
promenades in the beach area. Read more about the [ rules around

Some local authorities allow dogs on Blue Flag beaches at certain times. You
can check the rules about dogs on the beach and other beach bye-laws on [ your
local authority’s website ](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/942f74-local-
