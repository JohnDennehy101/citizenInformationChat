###  **Going out to sea on a boat**

If you are in danger on a boat and it has a radio you can use channel 16 to
tell the operator your location. If you do not have a radio, use your phone to
call 112 or 999 and ask for the Coast Guard.

If you are mooring a boat or other sea vessel on the Irish coast, you need
permission with a lease or license. [ Find out how to get a foreshore lease or
