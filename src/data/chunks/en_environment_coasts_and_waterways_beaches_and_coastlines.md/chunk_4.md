##  Sea swimming in Ireland

You can swim in the sea in many places around the Irish coast. It is important
to prepare yourself before swimming by finding out about tides, bathing water
quality and swimming bans before you swim.

You may want to check the local tides as many swimming areas need a high tide
to enjoy swimming there. You can [ read more about the types of tides and
safety around tides ](https://www.swimireland.ie/news/tides-currents-what-
swimmers-need-to-know) .

You can find bathing areas managed by local authorities using the
Environmental Protection Agencyâ€™s map on [ beaches.ie
](http://beaches.ie/find-a-beach/#/) .
