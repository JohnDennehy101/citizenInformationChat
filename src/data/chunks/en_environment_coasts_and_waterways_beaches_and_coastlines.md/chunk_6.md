###  **What do flags mean at the beach?**

When you visit a beach, you’ll see signs with important safety information
about the beach and if it is safe to swim. If the beach has lifeguards, you’ll
also see flags that tell you where it is safe to swim.

  * Red flags only mean do not swim 
  * Between the red and yellow flags is safe to swim 
  * Between black and white checkerboard flags it is safe to surf and windsurf, but not swim
