###  **Coastal walks**

There are many coastal walks in Ireland. Before going for your walk, always
check the weather forecast for any weather warnings. Check the time of the
tides to avoid becoming stranded because of tides. Have a charged phone so you
can call for help if you get stranded, injured or need help.
