##  How to report suspicions of drugdealing

Anyone wishing to pass on information on drug dealing should call the [
Crimestoppers ](https://www.justice.ie/en/JELR/Pages/WP15000275) freephone
confidential number **1800 25 00 25** or the Garda Confidential freephone
number **1800 666 111** .

If you have information on drug dealing activity in your community you can
telephone the freephone number. You will get through to a trained operator who
will ask you for your information and nothing more. The calls are handled by
staff that have been trained to deal with the sensitivities around the issue.
You will not be asked for your name and your number will not be traced. No one
will know that you have called.

The information gathered is passed on directly to the [ Garda National Drugs
and Organised Crime Bureau (GNDOCB) ](https://www.garda.ie/en/about-
us/organised-serious-crime/garda-national-drugs-and-organised-crime-bureau/)
which assesses its usefulness. The GNDOCB passes relevant information on to
the Gardaí in the specified area for investigation. The Gardaí can use the
information to build a case against a known drug dealer, to investigate new
allegations of drug dealing activity in a community or to make an arrest.
