###  Mind yourself too

Supporting someone with postnatal depression can be worrying and stressful.
Remember to look after yourself during this time too.

Speak to your friends or family about how you are feeling, and ask them for
help if you need it. Or, you can [ contact your GP
](https://www2.hse.ie/services/find-a-gp/) to chat about any concerns you
have.
