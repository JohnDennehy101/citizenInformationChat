##  Supports for postnatal depression

If you think you are experiencing postnatal depression, it is important to [
ask for help ](https://www2.hse.ie/conditions/mental-health/postnatal-
depression/getting-help.html) . You can [ contact your public health nurse
](https://www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/2/healthcentres/) or [ call your GP
](https://www2.hse.ie/services/find-a-gp/) anytime to discuss how you are
feeling. If you do not feel up to calling your GP, you can ask someone you
trust (such as a partner, friend or family member) to make an appointment for
you.

Other organisations, including charities and parent support groups, are
available too.

Some private health insurance companies include cover for counselling services
under their mother and baby plans. Check with your insurer to see what is
available to you.
