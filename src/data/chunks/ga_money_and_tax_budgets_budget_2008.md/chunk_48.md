###  Reform of stamp duty on Residential Property

The current Stamp Duty system applicable to residential property is being
reformed.  
  
A simplified system, incorporating an exemption of €125,000 with 2 progressive
rates instead of the existing 6 rate bands, is being introduced with immediate
effect (5 December 2007).  
  
Transactions not exceeding the €125,000 exemption level will not be liable to
stamp duty. For amounts above this €125,000 exemption level, but not exceeding
€1 million, stamp duty will be charged at 7% on the excess over €125,000.
Where the property exceeds €1 million, the part in excess of €1 million will
be charged at 9% with the remainder between €125,000 and €1 million subject to
a 7% charge.  
  
In addition, properties with a value in excess of €125,000 but not exceeding
€127,000 will not be liable for stamp duty.  
  
This change will take effect in respect of instruments which are required to
be presented to the Revenue Commissioners for stamping no later than 5
December 2007\. Instruments which are executed in the 30 days prior to 5
December 2007 will therefore benefit from this change.  
  
Current exemptions in relation to first time buyers and buyers of new homes
will continue to apply.
