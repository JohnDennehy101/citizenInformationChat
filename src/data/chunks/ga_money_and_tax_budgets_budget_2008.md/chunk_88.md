###  CO2 emissions and Vehicle Registration Tax (VRT)

Under a revised Vehicle Registration Tax (VRT) system the CO2 emissions of a
car will replace engine size as the criterion to determine the VRT rate
payable on the car at point of registration. Lower emission cars will attract
reduced VRT rates and higher emission cars will be liable to higher rates. The
VRT rates will continue to be applied to the Open Market Selling Price of the
car. The revised VRT system will take effect on 1 July 2008.
