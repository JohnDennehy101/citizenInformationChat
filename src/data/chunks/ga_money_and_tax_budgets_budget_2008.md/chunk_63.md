###  Stamp duty on residential property  

A new simplified system of stamp duty is introduced with effect from 5
December 2007. It will also apply to instruments executed in the 30 days
before that date.  
  
The first €125,000 of a residential property transaction will be exempt from
stamp duty.  
  
Properties over €125,000 but under €1 million will be charged stamp duty of 7%
on the excess over €125,000.  
  
Properties over €1 million will be charged stamp duty of 9% on the excess over
€1 million and 7% on the remainder between €125,000 and €1 million.  
  
Properties with a value of more than €125,000 but not exceeding €127,000 will
not be liable for stamp duty  
  
The current exemptions for first-time buyers and buyers of new homes still
apply.
