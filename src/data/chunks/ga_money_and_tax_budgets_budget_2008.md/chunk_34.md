###  Tax relief on medical expenses

There are new provisions about tax relief on certain medical expenses,
contained in Section 9 of the Finance Act 2007, but only coming into effect at
a practical level now.

Up to 2007, the first €125 of certain health expenses in the claim year was
disallowed and didn't qualify for relief. With a claim for a family or other
dependents the first €250 of expenses incurred in that year was disallowed.

These thresholds have been abolished for tax year 2007. You can now claim tax
relief at your marginal rate on medical expenses incurred during 2007.

Furthermore, the provision that there is a defined relationship between the
taxpayer and the subject of the tax relief claim is being abolished in
relation to health expenses relief from 2007 onwards. Up to now, you could
only claim tax relief on expenses incurred by certain people (spouses, child
dependents, among others).
