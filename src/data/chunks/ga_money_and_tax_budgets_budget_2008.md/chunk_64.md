###  Clawback of stamp duty

The exemption from stamp duty for first-time house buyers and buyers of
certain  
new homes is currently clawed back if the purchaser rents out the home within
5 years of date of purchase. This clawback period is being reduced to 2 years
for all deeds of transfer executed on or after 5 January 2007.  
  
For deeds of transfer executed before 5 December 2007, if that house or
apartment is rented out on or after 5 December 2007, it will not involve a
claw-back of relief where this happens in the third, fourth or fifth year of
ownership.
