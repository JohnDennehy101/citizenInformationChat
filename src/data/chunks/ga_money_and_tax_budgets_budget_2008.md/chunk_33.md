###  Increase in the Specified Rates for Preferential Home Loans and Other
Loans

An employee who gets a preferential loan through their employer is charged
income tax on the difference between the interest actually paid and the amount
which would have been payable at the ''specified'' rates of interest for the
loans. To reflect increases in interest rates, the specified rate in respect
of home loans is being increased from 4.5% to 5.5 % and the specified rate in
respect of other loans is being increased from 12% to 13%. These changes will
take effect from 1 January 2008.
