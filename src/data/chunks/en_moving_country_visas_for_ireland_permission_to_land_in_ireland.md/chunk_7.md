###  Preparing for entering Ireland

You must have a passport or recognised travel document if you are coming from
a country outside the EEA. You may also need to have a visa.

You should have proof of the reasons you are coming to Ireland. The documents
you need depend on the purpose of your trip. If you are visiting Ireland for a
short period, you should have:

  * Proof that you have money to support yourself and your dependents 
  * Proof of where you are staying while you are in Ireland 
  * A return ticket to go back to the country where you normally live 
  * Proof that you are working or studying in your home country, or have other important things (for example, family commitments) to return to 

If you plan to travel to the UK as well, you must have permission to enter the
UK before you come to Ireland.

If you are moving to Ireland, you have to show that you meet the requirements
for your reasons for moving here. Some examples of the reasons for travelling
