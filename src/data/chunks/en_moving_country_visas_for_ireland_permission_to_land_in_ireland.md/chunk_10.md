##  If you are granted permission to enter

This information is for citizens of countries outside the EEA, Switzerland and
the UK.

You may be given permission to enter but with conditions attached. For
example, you may only be allowed to stay for a stated period. The immigration
officer will stamp your passport with information about the conditions of your
stay.

The immigration officer may grant you a visitor permission which allows you to
stay for a maximum of 3 months. In certain unforeseen circumstances, this [
visitor permission may be extended
](https://www.irishimmigration.ie/extension-of-visitor-permission/) .

If you want to stay in Ireland for longer than this, you must apply for [
permission to remain by registering with your immigration office.

to-register-your-immigration-permission-for-the-first-time/)

However, [ visa-required nationals ](/en/moving-country/visas-for-
ireland/visa-requirements-for-entering-ireland/) who have entered Ireland on a
C (or ‘short stay’) visa cannot extend their permission to remain, unless they
were granted a C visa to join an EEA family member. They must leave and apply
for a D visa from outside Ireland if they want to return.
