###  What happens if I am refused entry to Ireland?

If you are refused permission to enter Ireland, you may be [ detained in
prison ](/en/justice/prison-system/prisons-and-places-of-detention#l5a719) .

If your solicitor thinks that the refusal was unlawful, they may apply to
court for an injunction to stop you from being deported. This is a type of
court order that prevents the deportation from going ahead while the court
decides if the refusal was lawful.

You may be deported back to the country where you normally live.
