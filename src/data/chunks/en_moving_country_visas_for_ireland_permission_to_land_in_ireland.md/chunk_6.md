###  Preclearance

If you do not need a visa to enter Ireland, you have to get pre-clearance
before you travel to Ireland if you are moving here because:

  * You plan to practice as a [ minister of religion ](https://www.irishimmigration.ie/coming-to-work-in-ireland/what-are-my-options-for-working-in-ireland/coming-to-work-for-more-than-90-days/minister-of-religion/)
  * You are a [ volunteer ](https://www.irishimmigration.ie/coming-to-work-in-ireland/what-are-my-options-for-working-in-ireland/coming-to-work-for-more-than-90-days/volunteer/)
  * You are the [ de facto partner of an Irish citizen ](/en/returning-to-ireland/residency-and-citizenship/returning-to-ireland-with-your-de-facto-partner/) (this means you are in a relationship with an Irish citizen that is like a marriage, but you are not married to them) 
  * You are the [ de facto partner of a Critical Skills Employment Permit holder ](https://www.irishimmigration.ie/coming-to-join-family-in-ireland/joining-an-eea-or-swiss-national/de-facto-partner-of-a-critical-skills-employment-permit-holder-csep-or-hosting-agreement-holder-ha/)
  * You are joining or accompanying a [ UK national family member ](https://www.irishimmigration.ie/coming-to-join-family-in-ireland/joining-your-uk-national-family-member/)

If your preclearance application is successful, you will be granted a letter
of approval or preclearance letter. This must be presented to the immigration
officer at border control when you arrival in Ireland. An Immigration Officer
at border control can refuse you entry even if you have a preclearance letter
and visa.
