##  Introduction

Ireland has rules and laws about who can enter the country. If you are a
citizen of a country that is outside the European Economic Area (EEA),
Switzerland or the UK, you must have permission to enter Ireland.

You get permission to enter Ireland from an immigration officer at the airport
or ferry port where you enter Ireland. If you enter Ireland through Northern
Ireland, you must get permission to enter after your arrival. You may also
need to apply for and be granted a visa to enter Ireland (see ‘Non-EEA
nationals and permission to enter Ireland’ below).

An immigration officer can refuse permission for you to enter Ireland, even if
you have a visa or residence permission in Ireland.

Ireland is not part of the [ Schengen Area ](/en/government-in-
ireland/european-government/european-union/schengen-area/) . This means that
you must have a national passport or national identity card to enter Ireland
from the EEA.
