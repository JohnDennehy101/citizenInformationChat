##  How long is Adoptive Benefit paid?

Adoptive Benefit is paid for 24 weeks from the date you adopted your child. To
get the full 24 weeks of Adoptive Benefit, your adoptive leave must begin on
the date of adoption.

You can take a further 16 weeks of unpaid [ adoptive leave
](/en/employment/employment-rights-and-conditions/leave-and-holidays/adoptive-
leave/) immediately after your 24 weeksâ€™ paid Adoptive Benefit. This period is
not covered by Adoptive Benefit but you can get a [ credited social insurance
contribution ](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/social-
insurance-prsi/credited-social-insurance-contributions/) for each week of
unpaid leave you take (up to the maximum of 16).
