##  Paying the mortgage

Once you have taken out the mortgage, you are now committed to paying the
monthly instalments as agreed in the contract with your lender. You should
keep all correspondence and documentation from your lender in a safe place, as
well as documents relating to insurance on your mortgage, house and contents.

It is very important to keep up your mortgage repayments. If you donâ€™t, your [

credit-history/) will be affected and your home will be at risk.
