##  Rules

All bicycles used on public roads in Ireland must always display a rear
reflector. A rear reflector is a red reflector that can be plainly seen for a
distance of 99 meters when a vehicles headlights shine directly on it. The
only exception to this rule is on a child's bicycle where that bicycle is used
during the daytime.
