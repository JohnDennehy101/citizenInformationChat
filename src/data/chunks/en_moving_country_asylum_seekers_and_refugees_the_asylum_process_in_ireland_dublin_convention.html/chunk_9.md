###  Requests to take charge

Ireland can ask another Dublin country to take charge of your international
protection application if you have not made an international protection
application in that country. Ireland must request this within 3 months of your
application for international protection in Ireland. If the request is not
made within 3 months, then Ireland must take responsibility for your
application.

The other Dublin country must accept or refuse the request within 2 months of
the request. If it does not respond within 2 months, then it is treated as if
they have accepted responsibility for your international protection
application.
