###  Requests to take back

Ireland can ask another Dublin country to take back your application if you
made an application for international protection in that country. Ireland must
send this request within 2 months of your Irish application. The other Dublin
country must respond within one month, or within 2 weeks if the request was
based on information from Eurodac.

Ireland can make an urgent request in some situations. For example, if you
were refused [ permission to enter Ireland ](/en/moving-country/visas-for-
ireland/permission-to-land-in-ireland/) or you are held in detention. Urgent
requests should be answered within one month.
