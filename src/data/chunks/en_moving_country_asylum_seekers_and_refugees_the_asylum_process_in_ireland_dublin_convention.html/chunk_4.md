If the IPO have reason to believe that another country should be responsible
for your application for international protection, it will use the Dublin

country/asylum-seekers-and-refugees/the-asylum-process-in-ireland/how-refugee-
applications-commissioner-deals-with-applications/) for international
protection until it has made a decision in the Dublin procedure. It will ask
you for the information it needs to make its decision. This could mean you
must attend an interview, or you could give them the information they need in
writing. Your [ solicitor ](/en/moving-country/asylum-seekers-and-
refugees/services-for-asylum-seekers-in-ireland/legal-aid-for-asylum-seekers-
in-ireland/) can help you.
