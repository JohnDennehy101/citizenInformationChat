##  Transfer decisions

The IPO will send you a transfer decision when it has finished examining your
case under the Dublin Regulations. If the IPO decides that your international
protection application should be transferred to another Dublin country, the
IPO will:

  * Refuse your application for international protection 
  * Contact the other Dublin country and request that they either take charge of your application or take you back to that country
