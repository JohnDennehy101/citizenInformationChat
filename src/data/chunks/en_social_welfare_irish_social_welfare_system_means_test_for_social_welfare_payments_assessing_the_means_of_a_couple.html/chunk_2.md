##  Introduction

If you are married, in a civil partnership or cohabiting the Department of
Social Protection (DSP) will assess both of your means when carrying out a
means test for a social assistance payment. This is the case even if only one
of you is actually claiming a payment.

For some social assistance payments, the DSP adds all of your means together
and then halves them to get the assessable means for each one of you. For
others, the DSP adds all your means together and then assesses them against
the maximum household payment for your circumstances.

This document gives a general overview of how the means test is carried out
for couples. You should also read the document on the payment you are getting
or have applied for as it will give more detail on income not taken into
account (or disregarded) for each payment.

For more general information you can read our document on [ the means test
](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/means-test-for-social-
welfare-payments/means-test/) . If you are getting a social insurance payment
such as Jobseeker's Benefit or State Pension (Contributory) and wish to claim
a payment for your spouse, civil partner or cohabitant only their means will
be tested. You can find out more about claiming a payment for a qualified
adult in our document [ Claiming for an adult dependant ](/en/social-
welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/claiming-a-social-welfare-
payment/claiming-an-increase-in-your-social-welfare-payment-for-an-adult-
dependant/) .

Note that in general if you have a joint account with your spouse, civil
partner or cohabitant, legally the total amount in the account is owned by
each of you. Therefore it can be assessed in full against each of you.
However, if you are both getting means-tested payments it will be assessed on
a shared basis or against only one of you.
