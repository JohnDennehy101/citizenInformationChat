##  Carer's Allowance

For Carer's Allowance your means are taken to be **half** of the total means
of yourself and your spouse, civil partner or cohabitant.

In the means test, all your sources of income are added together and 50% of
the total is taken to be your means. When assessing your means from capital
your combined capital is halved and this lower amount is assessed using the
standard formula. The resulting amount is then doubled before being added to
your other sources of income.

**Capital** |  **Weekly means assessed**
