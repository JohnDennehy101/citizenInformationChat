####  Jobseeker's Allowance

**Community Employment:** If you are getting Jobseeker's Allowance and your
spouse, civil partner or cohabitant start a Community Employment (CE) Scheme
in 2023, you _cannot_ claim an IQA for them. This means you are paid as a
single person plus a full-rate increase for each qualified child. In this
case, half of your combined means are taken into account in the means test. If
your spouse, civil partner or cohabitant started their CE Scheme before 2023,
it is [ assessed as part-time work ](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-
system/means-test-for-social-welfare-payments/work-and-jobseekers-allowance/)
.

**Maximum payment to a couple:** Note that if you are getting Jobseeker's
Allowance and your spouse, civil partner or cohabitant is getting one of the
social welfare payments listed below, the total amount paid to you as a couple
cannot be more than the maximum amount that would be paid to one person
(including adult and child dependants) on one social welfare payment. You can
choose which payment is most advantageous.

  * Illness Benefit 
  * Disablement Pension (when paid with Illness Benefit or Incapacity Supplement) 
  * Injury Benefit 
  * Invalidity Pension 
  * State Pension (Non-Contributory) 
  * State Pension (Contributory) 
  * State Pension (Transition) 
  * Jobseeker's Benefit 
  * Jobseeker's Allowance 
  * Farm Assist (FA)
