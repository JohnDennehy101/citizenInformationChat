ISD provides more information about [ what happens at the registration office
](https://www.irishimmigration.ie/registering-your-immigration-permission/how-
to-register-your-immigration-permission-for-the-first-time/information-on-
registering-if-living-outside-of-dublin-kildare-meath-and-wicklow/#during) .

**If residency permission is granted**

The Registration Officer will put a [ Stamp 4
](https://www.irishimmigration.ie/registering-your-immigration-
permission/information-on-registering/immigration-permission-stamps/) in your
spouse’s or civil partner’s passport. Your spouse or civil partner then has
permission to live and work in Ireland for the length of time stated on the
stamp.

**If residency permission is not granted**

In some cases, a Stamp 4 may not be given, for example if more information is
needed about identity, criminal history or relationship history. If this
happens, your partner may be asked to make a written application for residency
to ISD. Your partner is not entitled to work in Ireland until they have a
Stamp 4.
