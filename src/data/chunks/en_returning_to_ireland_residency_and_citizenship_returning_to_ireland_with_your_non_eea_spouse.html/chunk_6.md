####  **Checking the progress of the application**

Your spouse or partner can use their reference number to check the progress of
the application. [ Decisions at the Dublin Visa Office are published on the
ISD website ](https://www.irishimmigration.ie/visa-decisions/) by reference
number. If their application was sent to a [ visa office outside of Ireland
](https://www.irishimmigration.ie/visa-offices/) , they should contact that
office for processing information.

Your partner should be aware of processing times for preclearance and visa
applications. They are advised **not to make any travel arrangements until
they get a decision on their visa or preclearance** .

If your partnerâ€™s application is refused, they can appeal this decision within
8 weeks of the date of the refusal letter. The appeal process is free and they
can appeal once. The appeal should address the reasons for refusal stated in
the refusal letter and provide extra supporting documents if possible. The
refusal letter will say where your appeal should be sent.

Your partner cannot travel to Ireland until their visa is granted or their
preclearance letter is received.
