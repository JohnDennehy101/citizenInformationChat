##  Step 1: Check if your partner needs a visa to enter Ireland

If your spouse or civil partner is a citizen of a non-EEA country, they may
need to apply for a visa before they can travel to Ireland . You can use the
ISD website to [ check if they need a visa.
](https://www.irishimmigration.ie/visa-non-visa-required-nationalities/)

If your spouse or civil partner needs a visa, they must apply for a [ Join
Family Member (D) visa ](https://www.visas.inis.gov.ie/avats/OnlineHome.aspx)
online. If your spouse’s or civil partner’s visa application is refused, they
can [ appeal this decision ](https://www.irishimmigration.ie/appeal-a-
negative-decision/) .

If they do not need a visa, they can travel to Ireland without a visa or
preclearance. However, all citizens of non-EEA countries, whether they need a
visa or not, must go through border control at point of entry (which is
usually the airport) when they arrive in Ireland, see 'Prepare for border
control' below.
