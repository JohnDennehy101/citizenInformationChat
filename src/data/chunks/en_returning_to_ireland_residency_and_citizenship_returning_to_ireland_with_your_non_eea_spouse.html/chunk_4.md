##  Step 2: Send in the visa application

If your spouse or civil partner needs a visa, they must complete the [ online
application form ](https://www.visas.inis.gov.ie/avats/OnlineHome.aspx) . They
will need to print it out, sign it and gather several [ supporting documents
](https://www.irishimmigration.ie/coming-to-join-family-in-ireland/joining-an-
irish-national/join-family-visa/#guidehttps://www.irishimmigration.ie/coming-
to-join-family-in-ireland/joining-an-irish-national/de-facto-partner-of-an-
irish-national/) to send in with the application.

Your partner must submit these documents and signed application form **within
30 days** of submitting the online application. Some embassies and consulates
have [ additional requirements ](https://www.vfsglobalirelandvisa.com/) . At
the end of the online application they will be given a summary application
form.

This will include:

  * The address to send the signed form and supporting documents to (usually the Irish Embassy or Consulate nearest to them) 
  * Details of the [ fee ](https://www.irishimmigration.ie/preclearance-and-entry-visas-fees/) and how to pay 
  * The reference number for their application
