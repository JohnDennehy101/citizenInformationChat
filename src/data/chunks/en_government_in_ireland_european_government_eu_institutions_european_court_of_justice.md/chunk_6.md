###  Annulling EU law

A member state, the Commission, the [ Council of the European Union
](/en/government-in-ireland/european-government/eu-institutions/council-of-
the-european-union/) or the [ European Parliament ](/en/government-in-
ireland/european-government/eu-institutions/european-parliament/) may request
the annulment or cancellation of an EU law. This may happen if an EU
institution enacts a law that conflicts with the EU Treaties. If the CJEU
agrees that the disputed law is contrary to the Treaties, it will declare the
law null and void.

Private individuals or companies may also bring proceedings for annulment of
an EU law if they can demonstrate that the disputed law affects them directly
and individually. To bring proceedings for annulment, you should obtain legal
advice and/or representation. You do not need to go through the national
courts first in order to bring proceedings for annulment in the CJEU. If you
lose the case at the CJEU, you may be liable to pay the costs of both sides.
If you succeed, your costs will be paid by the EU and the law will be declared
null and void throughout the EU.
