##  Composition and role of the Court of Justice of the EU

The Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) is the judicial institution
of the European Union. This means that it deals with disputes between parties
as the [ courts ](/en/justice/courts-system/courts/) do in Ireland. The CJEU
ensures that European law is interpreted and applied in the same way in every
member state.

It sits in Luxembourg and is composed of the General Court and the Court of
Justice. The General Court has 54 judges and the Court of Justice has 27
judges, one from each member state. In addition to the 27 judges, there are 11
Advocates General who deliver reasoned opinions on cases to assist the Court
of Justice in making its decisions.

The General Court deals with certain categories of cases at first instance.
Decisions of the General Court can be appealed to the Court of Justice.

Judges and Advocates General of the CJEU must have the qualifications to be
appointed to the highest national courts in their member states or they may be
_jurisconsults_ (academic lawyers). Once they are appointed, they may not hold
any other office of an administrative or political nature and they may not
engage in any occupation, paid or unpaid. The Judges and Advocates General are
appointed by joint agreement of the governments of the member states. They
have a renewable term of 6 years.
