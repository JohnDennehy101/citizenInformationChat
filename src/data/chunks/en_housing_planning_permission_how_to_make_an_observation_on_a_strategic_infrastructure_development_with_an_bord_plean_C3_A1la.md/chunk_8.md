##  How long do An Bord Pleanála have to make a decision?

An Bord Pleanála must make a decision on a strategic infrastructure
development case within 18 weeks. If they can’t make a decision within this
timeframe, they must write to everyone involved in the case with an update.

An Bord Pleanála may not have been able to make a decision within the
timeframe because:

  * There was an oral hearing on the case 
  * They needed more information on the case to make a decision 

When a decision is made, you will be sent a letter to let you know the
decision.
