##  How is my social welfare paid?

If you live in Ireland and are getting a social welfare payment, you may be
able to choose the method by which you are paid.

You should check with the Department of Social Protection (DSP) the payment
methods that are available to you. The final decision on how you are paid
rests with the Department.

There are different methods of payment:

  * **Financial institution:** your social welfare payment may be paid by Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) directly into your personal account at a bank, building society or at certain credit unions. You can use [ form DIR PMT1 ](https://assets.gov.ie/43104/d9435859f91b4d53b02231380994ce7e.pdf) to apply for an EFT payment. The DSP will decide if you can be paid by EFT. 
  * **Post Office:** your social welfare payment may be paid to your local post office where it must be collected in person. You can collect your payment in cash from your Post Office. You will need a [ Public Services Card (PSC) ](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/public-services-card/) or Social Services Card (SSC) for identification (ID) to collect your payment. If using an SSC, you will also require photo ID. 
  * **By cheque:** payment by cheque can be made in exceptional circumstances or to pay arrears. It can be cashed in your local post office or lodged to your bank account. 

Social welfare payments are no longer paid using a book of _payable orders_
that you can cash at your local post office.
