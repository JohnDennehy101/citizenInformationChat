###  Complain to the appropriate national enforcement body

If your airline does not resolve your complaint, you should send it to the [
appropriate national enforcement body
](https://transport.ec.europa.eu/transport-themes/passenger-rights/national-
enforcement-bodies-neb_en) . Each member state is responsible for departures
from airports within its territory and arrivals into such airports from third
countries on EU/EEA-licensed carriers.

The [ Irish Aviation Authority (IAA) ](https://www.iaa.ie/consumer-
protection/air-passenger-rights) is the national enforcement body in Ireland.
It deals with complaints arising from flights departing from Irish airports or
those arriving at an Irish airport from outside the EU/EEA on an EUEEA-
licensed carrier. You can make a [ complaint online
](https://www.iaa.ie/consumer-protection/air-passenger-
rights#:~:text=How%20to%20make,our%20customer%20portal) .

If you have a complaint about a flight returning to Ireland from the EU/EEA,
you contact the national enforcement body in the EU/EEA state your flight
departed from.

For example, if you booked a return flight from Dublin to Malaga and the
outbound flight (i.e. the Dublin to Malaga flight) was cancelled then you
should contact the Irish Aviation Authority (IAA). However, if the return
flight (i.e. the Malaga to Dublin flight) was disrupted then you should
contact the Spanish equivalent, the Agencia Estatal de Seguridad AÃ©rea (AESA).
