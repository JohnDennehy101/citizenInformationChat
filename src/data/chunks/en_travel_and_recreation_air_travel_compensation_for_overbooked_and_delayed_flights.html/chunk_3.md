###  Who does the law apply to?

The law applies to all passengers departing from an EU/EEA airport. It also
applies to passengers departing from an airport outside of the EU/EEA but
arriving at an EU/EEA airport on an EU/EEA licensed carrier (unless they have
already received compensation or assistance in that non-EU/EEA country).
