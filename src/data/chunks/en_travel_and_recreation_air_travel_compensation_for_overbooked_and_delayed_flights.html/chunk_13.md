###  When compensation is not payable

You are not entitled to compensation if:

  * You have received at least 2 weeks’ notice of the cancellation; or 
  * You have received between 2 weeks and 7 days’ notice but you have been offered an alternative flight departing no more than 2 hours before your original departure time and arriving at your final destination less than 4 hours after your original scheduled time of arrival; or 
  * You have received less than 7 days’ notice but you have been offered an alternative flight departing no more than 1 hour before your original departure time and arriving at your final destination less than 2 hours after your original scheduled time of arrival. 

If the airline can prove that the cancellation was caused by an extraordinary
circumstance which could not have been avoided, even if all reasonable
measures had been taken, no compensation is payable.

Examples of _extraordinary circumstances_ may include:

  * Weather conditions 
  * Air traffic control restrictions 
  * Security risks and 
  * Industrial disputes that affect the operation of the flight
