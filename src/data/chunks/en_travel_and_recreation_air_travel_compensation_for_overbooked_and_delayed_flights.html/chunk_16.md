###  Refund

If the flight is delayed at least 5 hours, you must be offered a refund of
your ticket instead of flying. A refund is a full refund of the ticket for the
part or parts of the journey you have not made and for the part or parts you
already made if the flight is no longer serving any purpose to your original
travel plan. When relevant, it also includes a return flight to your first
point of departure, at the earliest opportunity.
