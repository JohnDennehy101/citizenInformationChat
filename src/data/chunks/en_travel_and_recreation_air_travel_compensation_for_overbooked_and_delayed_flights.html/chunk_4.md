###  Who does the law not apply to?

The law does not apply if you are travelling free of charge or at a fare that
is reduced and is not available directly or indirectly to the public. Tickets
purchased under frequent flyer programmes or similar commercial programmes are
not considered reduced fare tickets. The law also does not apply if you do not
have a confirmed reservation or relevant document (visa etc), if you do not
arrive at the boarding gate at a good time or if you pose safety or security
concerns.
