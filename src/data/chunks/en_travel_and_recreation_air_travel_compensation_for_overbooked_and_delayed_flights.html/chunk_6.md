###  Reservation not confirmed or not checked in

If you have not confirmed your reservation in time or presented yourself for
check-in at the time specified by the airline, the law does not apply. The
airline can refuse to allow you to board the aircraft.

If you have been denied access to the aircraft in these circumstances, you are
not entitled to any compensation. The airline may, however, agree to
accommodate you on a later flight (with or without charge) if there is
availability. If you did not confirm your reservation or you did not present
yourself for check-in at the specified time, it depends on the terms and
conditions of your ticket as to whether or not you must pay again for the
flight.
