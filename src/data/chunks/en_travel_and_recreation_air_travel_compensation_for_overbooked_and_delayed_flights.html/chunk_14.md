###  Refunds and re-routing

If you choose a refund and you are entitled to compensation, the amount you
are entitled to depends on the type of flight. See  Compensation  below.

Where the choice is re-routing, the compensation that is paid depends on the
length of delay past the originally planned time in arriving at your final
destination. See  Compensation  below.

Free meals and refreshments must be offered depending on how long the waiting
time is. Hotel accommodation must also be offered free of charge where an
overnight stay becomes necessary, as well as transport between the hotel and
the airport. You must be offered 2 free telephone calls, fax messages, or
emails.
