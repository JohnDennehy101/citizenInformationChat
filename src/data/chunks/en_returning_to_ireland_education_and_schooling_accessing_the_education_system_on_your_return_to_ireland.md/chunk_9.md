####  **Religion and school admission**

Schools cannot use religion as a basis for admission and are not allowed to
prioritise students based on their religious beliefs. However, there are some
exceptions to this:

  * A school that provides religious instruction or education in a minority religion can prioritise a student of that religion who is looking for admission to a school that provides religious instruction or education consistent with, or similar to, their religious beliefs 
  * A school that aims to promote certain religious values can refuse to admit a student who is not of that religious denomination if it can prove the refusal is essential to maintain the ethos of the school
