####  **Paying for admission**

Most schools cannot charge fees or ask for contributions as a condition for
admission or continued admission. Exceptions to this rule include:

  * Fee-charging post-primary schools 
  * Boarding schools 
  * Schools that provide post leaving certificate courses 
  * Further education and training courses run by post-primary schools
