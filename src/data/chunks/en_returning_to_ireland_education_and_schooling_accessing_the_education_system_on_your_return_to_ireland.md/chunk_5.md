###  Bring documents with you

It is a good idea to keep a file on your or your child's educational history.
This will help when enrolling in school or college and can help a new teacher
understand your child’s skills and needs.

The file could include the following:

  * Copies of all school reports 
  * Reference letters from teachers and/or principals 
  * A list of current textbooks and course outlines 
  * Results from standardised tests or state examinations 
  * Examples of your child’s latest classroom work, especially in maths and English 
  * Immunisation and recent medical records
