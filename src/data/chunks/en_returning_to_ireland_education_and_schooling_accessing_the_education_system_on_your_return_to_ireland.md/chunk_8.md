###  **Admissions policies in schools**

In Ireland, students usually attend their local school, but you can apply for
your child to attend any school in the country. You can use the Department of
Education’s ‘ [ Find a School’ search tool
](https://www.gov.ie/en/service/find-a-school/) to find schools you are
interested in.

If there are not enough places, the school must give priority based on their [
admissions policy, as well as the published annual admissions notice
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/education/the-irish-education-
system/admissions-policies-in-primary-and-secondary-schools/) . A school must
publish their admission notice before accepting any applications for a given
year, and it must be on their website. Schools are also required to make the
admission notice available to you if you request it in writing. The admission
notice must tell you the following:

  * How to get a copy of the school’s admission policy 
  * How to get an application form for admission 
  * The date when the school will start to accept applications for the year 
  * The deadline for receiving applications 
  * The date the school will inform you of their decision 
  * The date by which you must accept a place 

If a school is not over-subscribed, the school should continue to accept all
applicants, even after that deadline has passed.

The admission policy must state that the school [ will accommodate the
admission of children with a disability or other special educational needs.
