###  Publication schemes

FOI bodies must have a publication scheme in place. This means that the FOI
body should publish as much information as possible in a way that is open and
easy to access, without the need for an FOI request. This information should
be published under the following headings:

  * Information about the body 
  * Services provided to the public 
  * Decision making processes for major policy proposals 
  * Financial information 
  * Procurement 
  * FOI disclosures log and other information to be published routinely
