##  Residence for tax purposes

Your residence for tax purposes depends on the number of days that you are
present in Ireland during a tax year. A tax year runs from 1 January to 31
December.

You are resident for tax purposes for a year if:

  * You spend 183 days or more in Ireland in that year or, 
  * If you spend 280 days or more in Ireland over a period of 2 consecutive tax years, you will be regarded as resident for the second tax year. For example, if you spend 140 days here in Year 1 and 150 days here in Year 2, you will be resident in Ireland for Year 2. You must be in Ireland for a minimum of 31 days each year. 

You are treated as being present in Ireland for a day if you are present at
any time during that day.
