##  Introduction

Your liability for tax in Ireland can be affected by whether you are resident
in the country and whether Ireland is your permanent home. There is a specific
definition of residence for tax purposes depending on how many days you spend
in the country. If you are not resident in a particular year, Ireland can
still be your ‘ordinary residence’ since this term refers to the country where
you are usually resident over a number of years. The country that is your
permanent home is known as your _domicile_ .
