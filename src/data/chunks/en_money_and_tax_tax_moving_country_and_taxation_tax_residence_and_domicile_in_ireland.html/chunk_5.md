##  Ordinary residence

Your pattern of residence over a number of years is taken into account to
decide your ‘ordinary residence’.

If you have been resident for the previous 3 tax years, then you become
ordinarily resident from the start of the fourth year. If you leave the
country, you will continue to be ordinarily resident until you have been non-
resident for 3 continuous tax years. See revenue.ie for [ more information on
ordinary residence ](https://www.revenue.ie/en/jobs-and-pensions/tax-
