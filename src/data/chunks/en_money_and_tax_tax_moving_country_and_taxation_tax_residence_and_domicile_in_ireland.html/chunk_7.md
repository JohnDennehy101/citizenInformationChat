##  What is domicile in Ireland?

Your domicile is the country where you live with the intention of remaining
there permanently. It may be different to your residence or nationality.

When you are born, you have a _domicile of origin_ . This domicile can be
changed to a _domicile of choice,_ if you move to a different country with the
intention of living there permanently.
