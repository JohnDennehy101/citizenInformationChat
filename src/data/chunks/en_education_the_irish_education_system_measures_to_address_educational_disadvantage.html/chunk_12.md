###  **Equal Start**

[ Equal Start ](https://www.gov.ie/en/press-release/035a5-equal-start-for-
children-experiencing-disadvantage-a-major-new-model-of-government-funded-
supports-is-announced/) is a new scheme which aims to support disadvantaged
children in early learning and care and school-age childcare settings.

A Family Community Liaison role will be created, and funding will go towards
tailored supports for children as well as meals and staff time.

The targeted supports will be available to children who are:

  * In disadvantaged areas 
  * In the Traveller and Roma communities 
  * On the National Childcare Scheme through a sponsor body 
  * Experiencing homelessness 
  * In the International Protection system 

Equal Start will start rolling out from September 2024, and is expected to be
fully operational by 2028.
