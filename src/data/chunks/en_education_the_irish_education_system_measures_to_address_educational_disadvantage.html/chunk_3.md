##  Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools (DEIS)

The Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools (DEIS) programme aims to
reduce educational disadvantage. It is a Department of Education policy.

Under the DEIS programme, schools with the highest number of students at risk
of educational disadvantage get extra resources. A number of pre-existing
programmes were brought together under the DEIS framework.
