##  How to make a formal complaint

You should report the bullying to a manager.

Your employer's policy on bullying should clearly set out:

  * What will happen when a formal complaint is made 
  * How the complaint will be investigated 
  * Who will carry out the investigation taking into account issues of confidentiality and the rights of both parties 

The companyâ€™s investigator should meet with you and any witnesses or relevant
other people on a confidential basis. You can bring a work colleague or trade
union representative with you to this meeting. This applies to both the
complainant and the person complained of.

Your employer should keep records and copies of written statements should be
given to both parties.
