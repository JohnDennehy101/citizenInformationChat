##  Taking your complaint further

If you feel that your complaint about bullying has not been dealt with
properly by your employer, you may make a complaint under employment equality
or health and safety legislation to the Workplace Relations Commission.

You must use the [ online complaint form
](https://www.workplacerelations.ie/en/Complaints_Disputes/Refer_a_Dispute_Make_a_Complaint)
. All complaints must be made within 6 months. This time limit can be
increased to 12 months if you can show there was a “reasonable cause” for the
delay.

**Unfair dismissal**

If the bullying becomes unbearable and you are forced to leave your job, you
may be entitled to claim [ constructive dismissal
](/en/employment/unemployment-and-redundancy/dismissal/constructive-
dismissal/) under the Unfair Dismissals Acts 1977-2015. This means that
although you left your job voluntarily, in reality you were forced to because
of the way you were being treated.

You should get legal advice about your rights before leaving your job. You may
make a claim to the Workplace Relations Commission, if you qualify under the
unfair dismissals legislation.

**Victimisation**

You cannot be [ penalised ](/en/employment/enforcement-and-
redress/victimisation-at-work/) (or punished) for bringing a claim under
employment equality, health and safety, or unfair dismissals legislation.

**Personal injury claim**

If the bullying at work is so great that it causes your physical or
psychological health to suffer or be affected, you may also be entitled to
bring a claim for compensation for personal injury.

You cannot look for compensation from your employer under the health and
safety legislation but you can make a personal injury claim through the [
Injuries Resolution Board ](/en/justice/civil-law/injuries-resolution-board/)
.
