###  Mediation

The WRC provides a [ mediation service ](/en/employment/enforcement-and-
redress/workplace-mediation/) , if both parties agree to it. The Mediator's
Institute of Ireland (MII) have a list of accredited meditators that also
provide private workplace mediation services. You get more details from [
themii.ie ](https://www.themii.ie/about-mediation/sectors-of-
mediation/workplace-and-organisation/) . Mediation can help to resolve issues
informally before a formal process is initiated.

For more details on the informal process, see the [ Code of Practice for
Employers and Employees on the Prevention and Resolution of Bullying at Work
(pdf)
](https://www.workplacerelations.ie/en/what_you_should_know/codes_practice/code-
of-practice-for-employers-and-employees-on-the-prevention-and-resolution-of-
bullying-at-work.pdf) .

If these informal approaches are not enough to resolve the issue and in
situations where the bullying continues, you may need to consider making a
formal complaint.
