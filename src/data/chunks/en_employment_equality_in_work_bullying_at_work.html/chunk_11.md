###  Secondary informal process

The secondary informal process can be used if the initial informal process is
not successful or your employer thinks it is not appropriate for the
seriousness of the complaint.

Your employer can nominate a separate person to investigate the complaint.
This person should not be the Contact Person. The nominated person should have
the appropriate training and experience and be familiar with the procedures.
They may be a supervisor, manager or someone in authority within your
organisation.

The nominated person responsible for managing the complaint should keep a
record of all stages of the investigation. You should check your employerâ€™s
anti-bullying policy for the steps to follow under the secondary informal
process.
