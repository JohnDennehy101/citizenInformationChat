###  Initial informal Process

You should begin by making it clear to the person that you find their
behaviour unacceptable and undermining. You could also put it in writing, if
you prefer. Focus on what they have done (offending acts) and the effects it
has on you.

Your employer may have a Contact Person named in the anti-bullying policy, who
can give you information on the process.

The person responsible for managing the complaint should keep a brief written
record of the issue and agreed outcomes and dates.
