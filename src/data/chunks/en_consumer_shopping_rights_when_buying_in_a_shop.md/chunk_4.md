##  What you can expect from your product

When you buy a product, you make a contract with the seller. The seller must
always provide products in line with the contract.

Under consumer law all products you buy must meet certain conditions. The
product must:

  * Be fit for any purpose you brought to the seller’s attention 
  * Be fit for all purposes which it is normally used for 
  * Have the qualities and features of similar type products 
  * Fit the description, type, quantity and quality agreed in the sales contract 
  * Be durable and of expected quality for normal use 
  * Meet the quality of any sample or model you were shown 
  * Match any advertisement or labelling 
  * Have the necessary functionality, compatibility, interoperability and other agreed features 
  * Come with all accessories mentioned in the sales contract and with the correct instructions 
  * Have the spare parts covered in the contract 
  * Be installed correctly by the seller (if applicable) 
  * Have information on digital updates that support the product, if applicable. You can get updates once or continuously 

You have the same rights when you buy at full price, reduced price (for
example, in a sale) or buy a second-hand good (if bought from a business).

In some cases, you are restricted by a seller’s shop policy or terms and
conditions, for example where you simply change your mind – see ‘Returning
something you don’t want’ below.
