##  Returning something you don’t want

You do not have an automatic right to a refund when returning something you
bought in a shop because you have changed your mind.

If there is nothing wrong with the item (for example, there is no fault) you
have no legal right to return the goods. Whether or not you can get your money
back depends on the seller’s returns policy.

However, many sellers voluntarily allow customers to return or replace goods
during a certain time period. The seller may offer a refund, exchange or
credit note as a goodwill gesture. Check what the seller’s returns policy is
before you buy.

If the seller accepts returns, you usually must:

  * Make sure the items are in good condition 
  * Keep the original labels and tags attached 
  * Have proof of purchase (for example, a receipt)
