####  **No longer eligible**

You must also notify Pobal if you are no longer eligible for the subsidy (for
example, you are no longer caring for the child for whom you were given a
subsidy).

If you or your partner no longer meet the criteria for the enhanced hours
subsidy, the subsidy ends 20 working days after the notification.
