###  **Key points about the income-assessed subsidy**

  * It is means-tested and available to families with an annual reckonable income of up to €60,000. 
  * Your hourly subsidy rates are based on your individual circumstances, such as your reckonable family income, the age and educational stage of your child, and the number of children in your family (see ‘National Childcare Scheme rates’ below). 
  * During school terms, you can use your subsidised hours for before-school and after-school childcare costs. 
  * You do not have to be employed but the number of subsidised childcare hours available will depend on the hours you and your partner work, study or train (see ‘How many subsidised childcare hours am I entitled to?’ below).
