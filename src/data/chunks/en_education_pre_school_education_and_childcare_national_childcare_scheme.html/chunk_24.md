###  Renewing your subsidy

Subsidies are awarded on a yearly basis. Parents and childcare providers will
be notified when a subsidy is due for renewal. You will get this notification
at least 20 working days before your subsidy payment is due to expire.

A 6-month renewal date will be set in some situations â€“ these are set out in
the [ NCS policy guidelines (pdf)
](https://www.ncs.gov.ie/NCS_policy_guidelines.pdf) .
