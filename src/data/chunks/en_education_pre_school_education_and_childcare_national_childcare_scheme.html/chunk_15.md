####  **Automatic method (Fast Track)**

Your income can be assessed automatically using information available from
Revenue and the Department of Social Protection (DSP).

If you agree to this, the NCS will get the information directly from Revenue
and the DSP using your [ PPS number ](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-
system/personal-public-service-number/) (and your partnerâ€™s PPS number, if
applicable).
