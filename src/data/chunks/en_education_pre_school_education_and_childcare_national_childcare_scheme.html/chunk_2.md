##  What is the National Childcare Scheme?

The National Childcare Scheme (NCS) helps parents to meet childcare costs.

The scheme provides 2 types of childcare subsidy for children aged over 6
months (24 weeks) and up to 15 (children aged 15 do not qualify):

  * A **universal subsidy** which is not means tested. 
  * An **income-assessed subsidy** which is means tested. 

You cannot get the universal subsidy and an income-assessed subsidy at the
same time. However, you can choose which subsidy is of greatest benefit to
you.

You must apply for a subsidy, but it is paid directly to your childcare
provider. Your provider then will subtract your subsidy from your childcare
bill.

You can apply online or by post (see 'How to apply for the National Childcare
Scheme' below).

Your childcare provider (this includes childminders and school-age childcare
services) must be registered with [ Tusla ](/en/birth-family-
relationships/services-and-supports-for-children/tusla-the-child-and-family-
agency/) and have a National Childcare Scheme contract with the Department of
Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth (DCEDIY).

The National Childcare Scheme is administered by [ Pobal
