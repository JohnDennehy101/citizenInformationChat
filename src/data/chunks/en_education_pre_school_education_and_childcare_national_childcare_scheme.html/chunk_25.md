###  What happens when my application has been approved?

When your application is approved:

  1. You get a unique code called a CHICK (Childcare Identifier Code Key) when your application is approved 
  2. Your provider uses the CHICK and your childâ€™s name and date of birth to register your child on the National Childcare Scheme 
  3. You get a notification on your portal asking you to confirm that the hours of childcare are correct 
  4. Your subsidy is paid directly to your childcare provider on your behalf 
  5. Your childcare provider subtracts the subsidy from your childcare bill 

If you choose to use 2 different childcare providers for a single child (for
example, on different days of the week), you can use a single CHICK for both
providers.

If you are separated from the parent of your child and you are both awarded a
subsidy for the child, you each get a different CHICK.
