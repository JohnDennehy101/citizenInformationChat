###  What if I'm not satisfied with the decision?

If you are not satisfied with a subsidy award or the amount of the subsidy,
you can have the decision reviewed by Pobal. You must request a review within
30 working days of the decision.

If you are still not satisfied following the outcome of the review, you have a
right of appeal to an appeals officer (independent of the scheme
administrator). You must appeal within 30 working days of the review decision.

Read more about the reviews and appeals process in the [ NCS policy guidelines
(pdf) ](https://www.ncs.gov.ie/NCS_policy_guidelines.pdf) .
