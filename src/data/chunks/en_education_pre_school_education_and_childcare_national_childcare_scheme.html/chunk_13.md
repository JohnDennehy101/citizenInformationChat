####  **Loss of work or study**

If you stop working or studying, you may no longer qualify for an enhanced
hours subsidy.

However, you get the enhanced hours for 4 weeks from the end date of your work
or study. Your subsidy is then reduced to standard hours.

You or your partnerâ€™s income will be assessed at the next renewal date unless
you ask for an assessment of income before that.
