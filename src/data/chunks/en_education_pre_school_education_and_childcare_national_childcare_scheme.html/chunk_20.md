###  **What are allowable deductions?**

When the NCS assesses your income, some of it is not taken into account. These
are called _allowable deductions_ or _allowable items_ . Your reckonable
income is reduced by the amount of the allowable deductions.

Allowable deductions include:

  * A multiple child discount of €4,300 if you have 2 children under 15 
  * A multiple child discount of €8,600 if you have 3 or more children under 15 
  * Pension contributions, within the limit allowed by Revenue
