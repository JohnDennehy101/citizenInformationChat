###  Entering documentary evidence

If the Garda√≠ or prosecution want to have documentary evidence included in a
court case, they must serve the accused with a copy of the document at least
21 days before the case is heard.

Either side (prosecution or defence) can challenge the credibility of the
documentary evidence used by the other by using contradictory evidence.
