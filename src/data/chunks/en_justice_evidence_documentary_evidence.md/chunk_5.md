###  The hearsay rule

The rule against hearsay prohibits out of court statement being used as
evidence of the truth of that statement. For documentary evidence to be
admitted, it must come under one of the exceptions to the rule against
hearsay.

Some of the types of documents that are permitted as exceptions to the rule
against hearsay include:

  * Public documents (for example birth certificates). 
  * Business records or other documents made in the ordinary course of business by someone with knowledge of the matter. This does not have to be in a commercial business setting (it could include documents made in the ordinary course of business of running a local authority for example). 

However, there are a number of safeguards in place under [ Section 8 of the
Criminal Evidence Act 1992
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1992/en/act/pub/0012/sec0008.html#sec8) ,
which allow the court to exclude a document in the interests of justice. This
means that if the court thinks that a document is unreliable, fake or would
result in unfairness to the accused, they can exclude the document from
evidence.
