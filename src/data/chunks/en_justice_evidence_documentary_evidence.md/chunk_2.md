##  What is documentary evidence?

Documentary evidence is evidence that contains a record of some kind.
Documents may be admitted as evidence in court, but there are rules in place
to determine their admissibility, and to help the court (or jury) to decide
what the documents prove.

Under the law in Ireland a document includes:

  * Anything with writing on it 
  * Maps, plans, graphs or drawings 
  * Photographs or films 
  * Audio recordings 
  * Computer records 

This is not a full list, and other types of documentary evidence may be
accepted.

Documents may be classed as [ real evidence ](/en/justice/evidence/real-
evidence/) where they are entered into evidence to prove their existence
(rather than as proof of the contents of the document). Documents may also be
classed as real evidence where they have been produced automatically (for
example CCTV footage and mobile phone records).
