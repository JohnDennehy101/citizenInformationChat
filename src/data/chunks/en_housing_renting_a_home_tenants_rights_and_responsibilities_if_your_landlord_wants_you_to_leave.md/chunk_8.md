###  Exceptions to Part 4 rights

If you are renting a self-contained flat or apartment in your landlordâ€™s home,
which was originally part of the main house, your landlord can choose to opt
out of the Part 4 provisions. If your landlord wants to take this option, you
must get notice of this in writing, before the start of the tenancy.

Tenants of certain properties let by housing associations do not get Part 4
rights. For example, people living in transitional housing. Transitional
housing is temporary supported accommodation that helps people move from
homelessness to independent living in permanent accommodation.

Part 4 rights do not apply to tenants in student-specific accommodation.
