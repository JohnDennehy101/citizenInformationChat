###  **If your tenancy is ending because of rent arrears, anti-social
behaviour or other reasons**

Your landlord can also end your tenancy if:

  * You do not keep your tenant obligations, for example, if you don’t pay your rent 
  * The rental property no longer suits your needs 

If your landlord is terminating your tenancy because you have broken your
tenant obligations, you must get a written warning notice at least 28 days
before the notice of termination is issued. However, if your behaviour is
seriously anti-social they do not have to give you a warning notice. The ' [
Notice periods ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/housing/renting-a-
home/if-your-landlord-wants-you-to-leave/#6a8d36) ' section below has more

If the rental property is no longer suitable for your household’s needs, the
notice of termination must come with a signed and dated statement stating:

  * The number of bed spaces in the property 
  * The reasons why the property is no longer suitable, given the bed spaces and the size and composition of your household
