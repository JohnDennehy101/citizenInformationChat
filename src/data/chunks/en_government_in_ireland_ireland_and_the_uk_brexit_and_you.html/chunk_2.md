##  Introduction

On 23 June 2016, the United Kingdom (UK) voted to leave the [ European Union
(EU) ](/en/government-in-ireland/european-government/european-union/european-
union/) in a referendum.

The UK left the European Union at 11:00 pm on 31 January 2020. The UK was then
in a transition period until 31 December 2020.

Despite the UK’s departure from the European Union, Ireland and the UK remain
in a [ Common Travel Area, ](/en/government-in-ireland/ireland-and-the-
uk/common-travel-area-between-ireland-and-the-uk/) which gives residency and
travel rights (among other things) to Irish citizens in the UK, and British
citizens in Ireland. You can read more about ‘ [ Residence rights of UK
citizens in Ireland ](/en/government-in-ireland/ireland-and-the-uk/residence-
