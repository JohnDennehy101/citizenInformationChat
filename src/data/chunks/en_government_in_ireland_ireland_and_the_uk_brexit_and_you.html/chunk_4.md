##  The Protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland

The UKâ€™s only land border with the EU is the border between Northern Ireland
and Ireland. When the UK voted to leave the EU, it was not clear how this
border would work.

As a result, a [ Protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland
](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/publications/revised-protocol-ireland-and-
northern-ireland-included-withdrawal-agreement_en) was included in the
Withdrawal Agreement. The purpose of the Protocol was to avoid a hard border
between Northern Ireland and Ireland, in a way that would protect the Good
Friday Agreement and the EU single market.

Under the Protocol:

  * The [ Common Travel Area ](/en/government-in-ireland/ireland-and-the-uk/common-travel-area-between-ireland-and-the-uk/) between Ireland and the UK continues to be recognised along with the rights it grants to Irish and British citizens 
  * Goods moving between Ireland and Northern Ireland do not have any customs, tariffs, or other restrictions placed on them 
  * Goods moving between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK need additional paperwork and checks 
  * Some EU laws continue to apply to Northern Ireland 

The use of the Protocol is up to the Northern Ireland Assembly. Every 4 years
after the end of the transition period, the Assembly can vote on whether it
wants EU law to continue on things like customs, duties and regulations.

If they vote to end any part of the Protocol, the decision will come into
effect 2 years later.
