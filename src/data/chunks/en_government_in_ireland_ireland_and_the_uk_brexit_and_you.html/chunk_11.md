###  Frontier workers

A frontier worker (also called a cross border worker) is a person who lives in
one country, but works in another country. For instance, if you live in the
Republic of Ireland and work in Northern Ireland, you are a [ frontier worker
](/en/government-in-ireland/ireland-and-the-uk/cross-border-workers/) .

**Irish citizens do not have to apply for a UK Frontier Work Permit** but can
still apply. The entitlements of Irish citizens to live, work and to access
other benefits in the UK are protected by the [ Common Travel Area
](/en/government-in-ireland/ireland-and-the-uk/common-travel-area-between-
ireland-and-the-uk/) .

Other EEA and Swiss citizens who live in Ireland but worked in Northern
Ireland (or another part of the UK) needed to apply for the UK’s Frontier
Workers Permit Scheme to continue working there after 1 July 2021. If you
started working in Northern Ireland for the first time after the end of 2020,
you must apply through the UK [ Points Based Immigration System
](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/new-immigration-system-what-you-need-to-know) .

If you are a British citizen living in Northern Ireland and working in the
Republic, you do not need documentation. The Irish Department of Justice can
give you documentation if you request it. You can make a request by emailing [
burghquayregoffice@justice.ie ](mailto:burghquayregoffice@justice.ie) ,
stating ‘frontier worker’ in the subject line.
