###  Cross border healthcare

You can no longer use the [ Cross-Border Healthcare Directive ](/en/health/eu-
healthcare/cross-border-directive/) to access healthcare in the UK.

The [ Northern Ireland Planned Healthcare Scheme
](https://www2.hse.ie/services/schemes-allowances/niphs/) allows you to get
healthcare in Northern Ireland in a similar way to the Cross-Border Healthcare
Directive. The healthcare must be publicly available in Ireland. You must pay
for the healthcare and then claim the cost from the HSE.

The Scheme is available until a permanent statutory scheme is approved.
Residents of Northern Ireland could access healthcare in Ireland under the [
Republic of Ireland Reimbursement Scheme
](http://www.hscboard.hscni.net/travelfortreatment/roi-reimbursement/) .

If you started your healthcare in the UK and began to receive that healthcare
before 2021, you may still be able to apply for [ reimbursement under the
Cross- Border Healthcare Directive ](https://www2.hse.ie/services/cross-
border-directive/apply-for-cross-border-directive-repayment.html#UK) until
this scheme closed in September 2022.
