###  **Can an ASBO** **be changed after it is made?**

A court can vary or end an anti-social behaviour order if you apply or if the
Garda Superintendent applies.

If you are going to apply for a change or an end to your ASBO, you must give
notice of the application to the Superintendent of your local area. If a
Superintendent intends to apply, they must notify you.
