###  **When can a behaviour warning be given?**

A behaviour warning cannot be issued more than 1 month after the last time the
behaviour took place.

A Garda can give a behaviour warning verbally or in writing. If they give it
verbally, the Garda must put it in writing as soon as reasonably possible and
then serve it on you personally or by post.
