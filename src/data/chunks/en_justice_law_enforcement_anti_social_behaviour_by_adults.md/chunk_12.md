###  **When can the Garda√≠ apply for an ASBO?**

Before the Garda Superintendent can apply for a behaviour order, one or both
of the following conditions must be met:

You

  * Have been issued with a behaviour warning and have not complied with one or more of the demands of that warning 
  * Have been issued with 3 or more behaviour warnings in less than 6 consecutive months 

If the Superintendent decides to apply for an ASBO, they must

  * Tell you that they intend to apply for an order, and 
  * Give you the details of the time, date and venue of the court hearing. 

They must apply in the District Court area where you live.

When an application is made for a behaviour order, you cannot be charged with,
prosecuted or punished for the same behaviour that is the subject of the
application.
