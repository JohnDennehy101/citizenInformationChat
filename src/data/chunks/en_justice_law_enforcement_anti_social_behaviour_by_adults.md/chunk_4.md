###  **Examples of anti-social behaviour**

For example, if a neighbour continuously plays loud music which annoys and
interferes with your peace and quiet this may amount to anti-social behaviour.

If large numbers of people continuously gather outside or near your property
or your local supermarket and their behaviour is causing you alarm, distress,
fear or intimidation then this behaviour may amount to anti-social behaviour.
