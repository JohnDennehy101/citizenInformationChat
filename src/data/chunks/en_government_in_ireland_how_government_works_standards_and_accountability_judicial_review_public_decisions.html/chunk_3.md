##  Types of decisions covered by judicial review

Decisions made by administrative bodies and the lower courts may be judicially
reviewed by the High Court. In a judicial review, generally the court is not
concerned with the merits of the decision but rather with the lawfulness of
the decision-making process. This includes reviewing how the decision was made
and the fairness of it.

Judicial review of a decision of the lower courts is generally not the same as
appealing the decision. An appeal against a decision of a lower court is often
based on the substance of the decision, rather than just how the decision was
made. However, in many cases where a judicial review is available, there also
may be the option of appeal.

Some examples of judicially reviewable decisions include:

  * Decisions of the District and Circuit Courts 
  * [ Inquest ](/en/death/sudden-or-unexplained-death/inquests-and-inquest-reports/) verdicts 
  * Decisions of tribunals (for example, the Labour Court, the Residential Tenancies Board, and the International Protection Appeals Board) 
  * Discharge of a member of the defence forces or An Garda Síochána 
  * Decisions of the [ Social Welfare Appeals Office ](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/social-welfare-appeals/)
  * Refusals of an Irish passport, marriage certificate, or visa 
  * Deportation orders 
  * Decisions of [ An Bord Pleanála ](http://www.pleanala.ie) relating to planning permission 
  * Decisions of Government bodies that require an Environmental Impact Assessment and/or an Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control (IPPC) licence. 
  * Decisions of the [ Legal Aid Board ](http://www.legalaidboard.ie) and the [ Law Society ](http://www.lawsociety.ie) . 
  * Decisions of a public administrative body relating to the environment.
