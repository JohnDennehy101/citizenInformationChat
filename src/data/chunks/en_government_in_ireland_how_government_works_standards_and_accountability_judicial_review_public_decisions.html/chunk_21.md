###  Costs

There is no fixed rate of charges for legal fees so you should get some quotes
before deciding on legal representation. Your solicitor must advise you in
writing of their fees. If it is not possible to give you a definite sum, they
must estimate a sum or give you information about how charges or fees will be
calculated.

Information on costs in judicial review cases on decisions concerning certain
environmental matters is available in our document: [ Judicial review in
planning and environmental matters ](/en/environment/environment-and-the-
law/judicial-review-in-planning-and-environmental-matters/) . See courts.ie
for [ information on the court fees payable ](https://www.courts.ie/judicial-
review) .
