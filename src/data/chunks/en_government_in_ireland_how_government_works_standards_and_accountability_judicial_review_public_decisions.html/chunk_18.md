###  Time limits

Order 84, Rule 21 (1) of the Rules of the Superior Courts provides that an
application for leave to apply for judicial review shall be made within 3
months from the date when grounds for the application first arose.

Where the relief sought is an order of certiorari in respect of any judgement,
order, conviction or other proceeding, the date when grounds for the
application first arose is the date of that judgement, order, conviction or
proceeding.

However Order 84, Rule 21 (3) provides for an extension of time for an
application for judicial review but the court shall only extend such period if
it is satisfied that:

  * There is good and sufficient reason for doing so, **and**
  * The circumstances that resulted in the failure to make the application for leave within the three month time period either: 

(i) Were outside the control of, or

(ii) Could not reasonably have been anticipated by the applicant for such
extension.

The court may have regard to the effect that an extension of the period may
have on a respondent or third party.

An application for an extension shall be grounded upon an affidavit sworn by
or on behalf of the applicant which shall set out the reasons for the
applicantâ€™s failure to make the application for leave within the three month
period and shall verify any facts relied on in support of those reasons.
