###  Notice parties

Any person who may be affected by the judicial review proceedings and judgment
should be notified or may apply to be heard as a notice party. For example
where a person challenges a planning permission granted by An Bord Plean√°la
(the respondent) the applicant for the planning permission would also be
entitled to be heard in the proceedings as a notice party as the proceedings
will have an impact on their planning application.
