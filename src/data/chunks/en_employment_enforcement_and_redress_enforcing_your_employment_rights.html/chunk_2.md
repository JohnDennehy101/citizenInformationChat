##  Your employment rights

If you are working, you have certain rights under employment law such as a [
minimum wage ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/employment/employment-
rights-and-conditions/pay-and-employment/minimum-wage/) and [ annual leave
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/employment/employment-rights-and-
conditions/leave-and-holidays/annual-leave/) . Employment legislation also
bans employers from [ victimising or penalising ](/en/employment/enforcement-
and-redress/victimisation-at-work/) you for trying to enforce your employment
rights.

If you are not getting your rights or entitlements, or if you lose your job
and consider your dismissal unfair, you can make a formal complaint â€“ see 'How
to make a complaint' below. Before making a formal complaint, you should try
to resolve the dispute with your employer directly.

The main organisations that enforce employment rights are the [ Workplace
Relations Commission (WRC)
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/employment/enforcement-and-
redress/workplace-relations-commission/) and the [ Labour Court
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/employment/enforcement-and-
redress/employment-appeals/) .
