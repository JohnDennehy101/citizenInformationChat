##  How to make a complaint

If you have a complaint about your employment rights, you should first speak
to your employer. If you cannot resolve your complaint informally, you can
make a formal complaint to the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC) using its
[ online complaint form
](https://www.workplacerelations.ie/en/Complaints_Disputes/Refer_a_Dispute_Make_a_Complaint/)
.

You must make your complaint **within 6 months** of the alleged incident
(dispute). This time limit can be extended by a further 6 months if there is a
reasonable cause for the delay.

Your complaint should be about one of your employment rights under the
relevant employment law. For example, your annual leave entitlement is set out
under the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997.
