##  HPV cervical screening

The HPV cervical screening test is a new test that looks for high-risk types
of HPV cells. These HPV cells can cause cervical cancer. Before March 2020, a
previous method of screening was used. This was called a smear test and it
only checked for abnormal cells.

cancerous cervical cells.
