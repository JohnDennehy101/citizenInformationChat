###  Problems with documents

If you are unable to include documents that are listed and you have tried to
get copies of the documents but are unable to, you should explain the reason
why you cannot include the documents.

If you are unable to send your birth certificate or marriage certificate, you
must use the affidavits below. An affidavit is only accepted if you can show
that you are unable to get your certificate.
