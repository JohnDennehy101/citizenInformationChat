####  EEA, UK and Swiss nationals

If you are a citizen of an EEA country, Switzerland or the UK, you do not have
to enclose a ‘reckonable residence’ calculation with your application. You
have to show your residence by using documentary evidence of your history in
Ireland. The online application form provides more information.

The EEA includes the EU and Norway, Iceland and Lichtenstein.

If you are a citizen of the EEA, Switzerland or the UK, you do not have to
register for an Irish Residence Permit. All periods of residence in Ireland
are counted towards naturalisation.
