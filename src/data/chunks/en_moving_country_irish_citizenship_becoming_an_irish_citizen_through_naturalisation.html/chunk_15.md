###  Scorecard system

ISD now uses a ‘scorecard’ system for assessing identification and residence
history. This means that you can use a wider variety of documents, and be sure
that you have enough evidence to send with your application.

You must have 150 points in both identification and residency. The [
Citizenship Guidance Document ](https://www.irishimmigration.ie/wp-
content/uploads/2024/04/Citizenship-Guidance-Document-April-2024.pdf) explains
how many points you get for different types of documents.

If your application for naturalisation is based on your [ marriage or civil
partnership with an Irish citizen ](/en/moving-country/irish-
citizenship/becoming-an-irish-citizen-through-naturalisation#leafc5) , you
will have to send documents that show your spouse’s nationality and also
evidence that you have been married for 3 years.

Some of the documents you need to send must be certified as ‘true copies’ by a
solicitor, notary, commissioner for oaths or a peace commissioner. You can ask
a solicitor to certify your documents when you are making your statutory
declaration (see Step 4 below). These include:

  * Your [ birth certificate ](/en/birth-family-relationships/getting-birth-marriage-or-death-certificate/)
  * Your spouse’s birth certificate (if your application is based on marriage to an Irish citizen) 
  * Your marriage certificate or civil partnership certificate (if your application is based on marriage to an Irish citizen) 
  * Your passport 

You can find a full list of the documents you need to send when you apply.
