###  Future intentions

You must intend in good faith to continue to reside in the State after
naturalisation. If your application is successful and you move away from
Ireland you should complete [ Form 5 (pdf)
](https://www.irishimmigration.ie/wp-
content/uploads/2022/07/Form-5-CTZ2-July-22.pdf) , which states your intention
to keep your Irish citizenship while you are temporarily living abroad.

If your application is approved, you must make a declaration of fidelity to
the nation and loyalty to the State. You must also swear that you will observe
the laws of Ireland and respect its democratic values. These declarations are
usually made at a citizenship ceremony.
