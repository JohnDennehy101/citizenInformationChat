##  What is naturalisation?

Naturalisation is when you become a citizen of another country, usually
because you have been living there for a number of years. To apply for
naturalisation in Ireland, you must be physically resident in Ireland for a
certain length of time.

All applications to become a naturalised Irish citizen are decided by
Immigration Service Delivery (ISD) on behalf of the Minister for Justice. The
Minister has absolute discretion as to whether or not to grant naturalisation.
The Minister considers a range of information available to decide on an
application for naturalisation.
