##  What can I do if I lose my certificate of naturalisation?

If your certificate of naturalisation is lost or stolen, you should write to
the Citizenship Division of ISD – see ‘Further information and contacts’
below.

You will not get a replacement certificate but instead you will be given a
statement confirming your Irish citizenship. There is no fee for this service.
If you are applying for an Irish passport, you will need this statement to
accompany your passport application.
