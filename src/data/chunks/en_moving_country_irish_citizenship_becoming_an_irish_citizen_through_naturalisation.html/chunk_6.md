###  Character

You must be ‘of good character’. There is no exhaustive legal definition of
what ‘good character’ means.

The Garda Síochána (Ireland's national police) provides a report about your
background. As part of this, the Minister receives information about the
following:

  * Your criminal record 
  * [ Driving offences ](/en/travel-and-recreation/motoring/driving-offences/driving-offences/) you may have committed 
  * Ongoing investigations against you 
  * Pending criminal cases (that haven’t been heard in court yet) 
  * Cautions or other warnings you have received from the Gardaí 
  * Certain civil cases (for example, if you were subject to a [ barring order ](/en/birth-family-relationships/problems-in-marriages-and-other-relationships/barring-safety-and-protection-orders/) ) 

You are asked on the application form to declare any of the above and you are
given the opportunity to explain the circumstances that led to the Garda or
court action. Before a decision is made on your citizenship application, you
will get an invitation to complete an [ e-vetting

citizen-by-naturalisation/citizenship-applicants-guide-to-an-garda-siochana-

your character is as up to date as possible.

If you are applying for your child who is age 14 or over, they must
demonstrate ‘good character’. The ‘good character’ test also applies if your
child is under 14 and has been charged with, or convicted of, a serious
violent or sexual crime.
