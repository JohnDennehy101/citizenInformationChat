##  When does a restraining order take effect?

When the person subject to the restraining order is notified, the civil
restraining order takes effect.

If that person is present in court, the order begins immediately.

If they are not in court, they have to be told and provided with a copy of the
courtâ€™s order. The court may direct a garda to do this.
