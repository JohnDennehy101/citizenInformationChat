##  How can I get a restraining order?

You can apply for a Section 28 Civil Restraining Order at the District Court
if you are experiencing stalking from a person who is not your:

  * Current or former partner or 
  * Family member 

The order may also protect another person connected to you (e.g., a child,
partner).
