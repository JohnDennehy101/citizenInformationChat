###  Your own home

The home in which you live is not included in the assessment of your means
from capital unless you are getting an income from it. If you are getting an
income from your home that income is assessed.

However, some income from renting a room in your home is not taken into
account in the means test. You can find more information about [ how income
from rent is assessed in the means test ](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-
