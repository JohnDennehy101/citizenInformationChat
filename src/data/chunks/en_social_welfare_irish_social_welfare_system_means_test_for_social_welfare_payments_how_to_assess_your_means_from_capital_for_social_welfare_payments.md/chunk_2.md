##  What is capital?

If you are applying for a [ social assistance payment ](/en/social-
welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/social-assistance-payments/social-
assistance-in-ireland/) , you must pass a ‘means test’. In the means test, the
Department of Social Protection (DSP) assesses all your sources of income,
including:

  * Cash income 
  * Employment 
  * Capital 
  * Maintenance 

Capital is any property you own (except for your own home), as well as any
savings, investments, stocks, and shares. The DSP will also look at any
capital belonging to your spouse, civil partner, or cohabitant.

This page explains how the DSP assesses your means from capital for social
welfare payments (except the [ Working Family Payment ](/en/social-
welfare/families-and-children/working-family-payment/) , as capital is not
assessed in this income test).
