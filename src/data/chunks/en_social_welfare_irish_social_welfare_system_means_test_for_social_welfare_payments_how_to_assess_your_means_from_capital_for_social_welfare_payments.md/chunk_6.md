####  **Disability Allowance and the State Pension (Non-Contributory)**

The means tests for Disability Allowance (DA) and the [ State Pension (Non-
Contributory) ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/older-
and-retired-people/state-pension-non-contributory/#c25dd5) use different rules
to assess capital. But if you are moving from DA to the State Pension (Non-
Contributory) at 66, you will not get a lower-rate Pension due to a less
favourable assessment of capital.
