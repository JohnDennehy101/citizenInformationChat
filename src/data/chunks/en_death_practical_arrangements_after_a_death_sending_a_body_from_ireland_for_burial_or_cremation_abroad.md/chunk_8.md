##  Documentation

Before a body can be removed from Ireland you need the following documents:

  * Coroner’s removal order/non-infectious note 
  * Embalming certificate 
  * Passport or identity card of the deceased person 
  * Funeral director’s declaration 
  * Embassy permit 
  * Notarisation or apostilling of documents if applicable (where a specially licensed lawyer verifies legal documents to ensure they are internationally valid) 

You should find out from the embassy what formalities and documents are
required. The funeral director can help with this. They can also obtain the
removal order from the coroner and the death certificate (if available) from
the Registrar.
