###  Travel arrangements

You need to arrange for the body to be taken from Ireland to the home country
of the person who died. Your funeral director can do this for you. The body
can be flown home or it can travel by ferry and overland.

You or the funeral director should notify the embassy of the travel
arrangements so that the authorities in the home country can be informed.

You or the funeral director also need to contact a funeral director in the
deceasedâ€™s country, who can liaise with the relevant authorities there and
arrange for burial or cremation of the body when it arrives.
