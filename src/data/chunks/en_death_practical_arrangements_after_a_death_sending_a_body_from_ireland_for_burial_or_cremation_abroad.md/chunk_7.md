###  Preparing the body for repatriation

If you appoint a funeral director in Ireland, they can embalm and prepare the
body for repatriation. Embalming helps to preserve the body. If a post-mortem
has been held, the funeral director can arrange the release of the body from
the coroner so that it can be prepared.

If you intend to arrange a cremation in the deceased personâ€™s country, you
should discuss which type of casket is best suited to this.
