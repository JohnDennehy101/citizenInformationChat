###  Identification of the body

The body must be formally identified. In some cases, this can be done by a
travelling companion or business colleague of the person who died. In other
cases, a family member may need to come to Ireland to confirm the person’s
identity. The Garda Síochána can also arrange for a family member to formally
identify the body.
