###  Do I have to report the death to the coroner?

You do not need to report the death to a coroner if the person died from a
natural illness or disease and had been receiving medical treatment for the
condition during the month before they died. In this case, a doctor can issue
the Death Notification Form, which you need to register the death and get a
death certificate.

If the death is sudden, unnatural or violent, it must be [ reported to the
coroner ](/en/death/sudden-or-unexplained-death/coroners/) for the district
where the death occurred.

Sudden, unexplained or violent deaths should be reported to the coroner by:

  * A healthcare professional in the case of a death due to natural causes in a nursing home or if the doctor had not seen the deceased within one month before their death 
  * The Garda Síochána in the case of an death from unnatural causes 
  * The deceased person’s doctor 
  * A funeral undertaker 
  * The Registrar of deaths 
  * Any householder and any person in charge of an institution or premises where the person who died was living 

The coroner will have the body moved to a mortuary and may arrange a post-
mortem to determine the cause of death.

You may report the death to a senior member of the Garda Síochána (not below
the rank of sergeant), who will notify the coroner.
