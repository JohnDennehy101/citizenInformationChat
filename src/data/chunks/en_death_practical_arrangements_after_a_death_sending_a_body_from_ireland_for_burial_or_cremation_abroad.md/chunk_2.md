##  Introduction

When someone from another country dies in Ireland, certain formalities must be
followed before the body can be sent out of Ireland for burial or cremation.
Returning someone’s body to their home country is called repatriation. The
following information sets out the general process and rules involved.

It can be very expensive to have a body repatriated. If the person had travel
insurance or private medical cover, that may help cover the costs. You may
choose to have the body [ cremated ](/en/death/practical-arrangements-after-a-
death/cremations/) in Ireland instead, and have the ashes sent to the deceased
person’s country.
