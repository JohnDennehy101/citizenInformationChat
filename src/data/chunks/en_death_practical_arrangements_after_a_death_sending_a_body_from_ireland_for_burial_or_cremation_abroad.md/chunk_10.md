##  Costs

Repatriation is expensive, depending on the distance to be travelled and how
the body is transported. Check whether the person had travel insurance or
private medical cover which would help to cover the costs. If they are
covered, contact the insurance company as soon as possible.

The Irish Government does **not** give financial assistance with the cost of
repatriating a deceased person.

If the deceased person was resident in Ireland, you may need information on [
