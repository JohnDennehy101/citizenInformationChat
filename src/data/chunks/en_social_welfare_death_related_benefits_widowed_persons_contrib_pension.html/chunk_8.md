###  Other payments for widowed people and surviving civil partners

Under the Occupational Injuries Scheme, a widow's, widower's or surviving
civil partner's pension may be payable if the death was due to an occupational
injury or disease.

People getting a Widow's, Widower's or Surviving Civil Partner's
(Contributory) Pension are eligible for the [ Household Benefits Package
](/en/social-welfare/extra-social-welfare-benefits/household-benefits-
package/) if they meet the usual conditions.

If your spouse or civil partner was getting a Household Benefits Package when
they died you can keep the package if you are aged 60 or over (even though you
do not meet the usual age requirement).

The [ Widowed or Surviving Civil Partner Grant ](/en/social-welfare/death-
related-benefits/widowed-parents-bereavement-grant/) is a once-off payment
available to widows, widowers or surviving civil partners with dependent
children.
