###  Social insurance contributions (PRSI)

To qualify for a Widow's, Widower's or Surviving Civil Partner's
(Contributory) Pension, either you or your late spouse or civil partner must
have a certain number of PRSI contributions. All the PRSI requirements must be
met on **one person's record** \- you may not combine the contributions of
both spouses or civil partners. All must have been made before the death of
the spouse or civil partner.

Virtually all PRSI contributions count towards this pension, including
contributions paid by public servants and the self-employed.

Either you or your spouse or civil partner must have:

  * At least 260 paid contributions paid before the _relevant date_ * 

**And**

  * An average of 39 paid or credited contributions in either the 3 or 5 years before the death of the spouse or civil partner or before he or she reached pension age (66) 

**Or**

  * A yearly average of at least 24 paid or credited contributions from the year of first entry into insurance until the year of death or reaching pension age. If this average is used then an average of 24 will entitle you to a minimum pension, you will need an average of 48 per year to get the full pension. 

*The relevant date is the earliest of the following dates: 

  * The date your spouse or civil partner died 
  * Your spouse’s or civil partner’s 66th birthday, if their social insurance record is used 
  * Your 66th birthday, if your social insurance record is used 

If your spouse or civil partner died before 27 December 2013, only 156 paid
contributions are required. However, the yearly average condition must still
be satisfied.
