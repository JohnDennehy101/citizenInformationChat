##  Introduction

Widow's, Widower's or Surviving Civil Partner's (Contributory) Pension is a
weekly payment to the husband, wife or civil partner of a deceased person.
This payment was formerly called the Widow's/Widower's (Contributory) Pension.
Either you or your deceased spouse or civil partner must have enough [ social
insurance contributions (PRSI) ](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-
system/social-insurance-prsi/social-insurance/) .

To qualify you must, of course, be a widow, widower or surviving civil partner
and you must not be cohabiting with another person.

If you are divorced and you would have been entitled to a Widow's, Widower's
or Surviving Civil Partner's (Contributory) Pension had you remained married,
you keep your entitlement to the Widow's, Widower's or Surviving Civil
Partner's (Contributory) Pension.

If your civil partnership has been dissolved and you would have been entitled
to a Widow's, Widower's or Surviving Civil Partner's (Contributory) Pension
had you remained in the civil partnership, you keep your entitlement to the
Widow's, Widower's or Surviving Civil Partner's (Contributory) Pension.

The pension is payable regardless of other income.
