##  Rules

You may automatically qualify for a Widow's, Widower's or Surviving Civil
Partner's (Contributory) Pension if your late spouse or civil partner was
getting a [ State Pension (Contributory) ](/en/social-welfare/older-and-
retired-people/state-pension-contributory/) which included an increase for a
dependent spouse or civil partner (or would have included an increase but for
the fact that you were getting [ State Pension (Non-Contributory)
](/en/social-welfare/older-and-retired-people/state-pension-non-contributory/)
, [ Blind Pension ](/en/social-welfare/disability-and-illness/blind-persons-
pension/) or [ Carer's Allowance ](/en/social-welfare/carers/carers-
allowance/) ).

There is no automatic qualification if your late spouse or civil partner was
getting a mixed insurance pro-rata, EU/Bilateral Agreement pro-rata or Pre-53
pension. In all such cases you should apply for Widow's, Widower's or
Surviving Civil Partnerâ€™s Contributory Pension in the normal way.

If you do not automatically qualify for a Widow's, Widower's or Surviving
Civil Partner's (Contributory) Pension, then either you or your late spouse or
civil partner must have a certain number of PRSI contributions.
