##  When is a life insurance policy unclaimed?

If you have a life insurance policy, it becomes unclaimed:

  * 15 years after your last communication to the insurance provider, unless the policy was for a specific length of time 
  * 5 years after the end of the term if the policy was for a specific length of time (or 5 years after you last contacted the insurance provider if that is later) 

You have the right to claim the money in your unclaimed life assurance policy
at any time.
