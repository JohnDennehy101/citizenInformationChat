##  How an advert could be misleading

Misleading or false advertising is an advert that deceives or is likely to
deceive you, or distort your decision to buy. An advert can also be misleading
if it leaves out important information that you might need to make an informed
decision.

Examples of how adverts can be misleading include:

  * False claims made about the characteristics of products and services - for example, a product weighs 900g instead of 1 Kg 
  * The price, or the way it is calculated, is misrepresented – for example, the product is advertised at sale prices but turns out not to be 
  * How a products or service is supplied is misrepresented – for example, it is advertised as ‘free delivery' but there is actually a fee or charge 
  * Details about the advertiser or trader are false – for example, claiming to be an ‘Irish based company' but is actually based abroad 
  * Creating a false impression even if the information is correct
