##  Introduction

Advertising is a key source of information for consumers. You have the right
to accurate and truthful information about products and services.

There are laws to protect you from being misled about products and services.
Businesses must not make statements in advertising that are incorrect or
likely to create a false impression – see ‘Rules banning misleading
advertising’ below.

Avertising laws apply to all types of communications that promote products or
services including:

  * Digital (online banners, websites and social platforms) 
  * Print 
  * Outdoor 
  * Radio and tv 
  * Leaflets or brochures and direct marketing
