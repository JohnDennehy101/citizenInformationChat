##  What is an advert?

Businesses have more options for marketing products and services than the
traditional forms of advertising, which were print adverts in newspapers,
television and radio commercials, and signs in shops.

Advertising methods now include:

  * Email or text promotions 
  * Digital advertising on websites, apps, social mediaand search engines 
  * Paying for website content, for example, a travel article that mentions their brand 
  * Providing a product or service to a popular blogger or influencer for free or at reduced price in return for encouraging followers to try it
