###  Ho **w the Commercial Court manages cases**

The Court uses a case management approach involving clear deadlines. This is
to help streamline the preparation for trial, remove unnecessary costs and
stalling tactics, and ensure full pre-trial disclosure.

The judge can adjourn proceedings so those involved can try and resolve the
dispute using alternative dispute resolution processes, such as [ mediation
](/en/justice/civil-law/mediation-and-settlement-of-claims/) , conciliation or
arbitration.

Disputes heard in the Commercial Court are typically dealt with in a number of
months, rather than a number of years, which can be common in the High Court.
