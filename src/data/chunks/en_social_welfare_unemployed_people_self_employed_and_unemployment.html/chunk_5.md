##  Supplementary Welfare Allowance

[ Supplementary Welfare Allowance ](/en/social-welfare/supplementary-welfare-
schemes/supplementary-welfare-allow/) provides a basic weekly allowance to
eligible people who have little or no income. If your weekly income is below
the Supplementary Welfare Allowance rate for your family size, a payment may
be made to bring your income up to the appropriate Supplementary Welfare
Allowance rate.

You cannot get Supplementary Welfare Allowance if you are working more than 30
hours per week. If you have claimed a jobseekerâ€™s payment but it has not yet
been paid and you have no other income, you may qualify for Supplementary
Welfare Allowance while you are awaiting payment.
