](https://www.gov.uk/taking-vehicles-out-of-uk) , when you are buying your
vehicle in the UK.

When purchasing a vehicle abroad, you should not purchase a vehicle you intend
to import to Ireland unless you can get its accompanying foreign registration
documents. You should not return a vehicle's registration documents in full to
other States before registration in Ireland is complete. If you do not present
the relevant Foreign Registration Certificate, registration will be refused.
