###  Paying the customs charge

You must pay the customs charge at the time the vehicle arrives in Ireland
from Great Britain. This means you have to declare the vehicle with customs
when you are entering Ireland or Northern Ireland at the ferry port. If you
are importing the car using a shipping company, the shipping company should
arrange the customs declaration and charge.

You can [ claim a relief from customs ](https://www.revenue.ie/en/importing-
vehicles-duty-free-allowances/transfer-of-residence/index.aspx) if you are
transferring your residence to Ireland from the UK and your vehicle meets
certain conditions, for example, you were using the vehicle for more than 6
months in the UK before you moved to Ireland.
