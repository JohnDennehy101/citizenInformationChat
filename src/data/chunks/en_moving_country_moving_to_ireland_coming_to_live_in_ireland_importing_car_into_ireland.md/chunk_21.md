##  VRT rates

Vehicle Registration Tax (VRT) is based on the Open Market Selling Price
(OMSP) of the vehicle. The OMSP depends on the market value, engine size,
year, model and roadworthiness condition of the vehicle.

After the vehicle has been inspected the rate of [ VRT is calculated by
Revenue ](https://www.ros.ie/evrt-enquiry/vrtenquiry.html?execution=e1s1) .
The VRT is collected by the NCTS on behalf of Revenue.

VRT for cars (Category A) is based on the level of carbon dioxide (CO2)
emissions from the car and the car’s nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions.

**CO2 charge for Category A vehicles from 1 January 2022**

More than 190 grams per kilometre  |  41% of OMSP (minimum €820)   
  
A Nitrogen Oxide (NOx) charge is combined with the existing CO2 charges to
form the VRT payable.

You have to give evidence of the vehicle’s NOx emissions to finalise
registration. If you do not give this information, you will be charged a flat
rate.

The NOx charge is calculated according to the following table:

NOx emissions (NOx mg/km or mg/kWh)  |  Amount payable per mg/km or mg/kWh   
---|---  
The first 0-40 mg/km or mg/kWh  |  €5   
The next 40 mg/km or mg/kWh up to 80 mg/km or mg/kWh  |  €15   
The rest above 80 mg/km or mg/kWh  |  €25   
  
If you do not give enough information about the NOx emissions these maximum
charges will apply:

  * Diesel vehicles: **€4,850**

or

  * All others: **€600**

The NOx charge replaces the 1% VRT surcharge on all diesel engine passenger
cars that was in place in 2019.

**Vehicle Registration Tax rates for all other categories**

**Category** |  **Vehicle** |  **VRT rate**  
---|---|---  
B  |  Commercial vehicles, designed and constructed for the carriage of goods and not exceeding 3.5 tonnes  |  13.3% of OMSP (subject to a minimum tax of €125)   
C  |  Other vehicles such as tractors, large vans, lorries, vintage cars (over 30 years old), minibuses (minimum 12 passenger seats)  |  Flat rate of €200   
|  Motor caravans/motor homes  |  13.3% of OMSP   
|  Electric motorcycles*  |  Exempt from VRT until 31 December 2025   
|  Electric vehicles*  |  VRT relief of up to €5,000 depending on the age of the car in respect of certain series production vehicles until 31 December 2025   
  
*An electric vehicle/motorcycle is propelled by an electric motor only.
