###  VAT

If you are importing a new car from another EU country you have to pay VAT
(Value Added Tax), usually when registering the car. A new car means a car
that has been in service for 6 months or less, or has been driven for 6,000
kilometres or less. For example:

  * Vehicle is 5 months old with 8,000km - chargeable to VAT 
  * Vehicle is 7 months old with 5,000km - chargeable to VAT 
  * Vehicle is 7 months old with 8,000km - not chargeable to VAT 

The VAT is payable even where you have paid VAT in the other country. You may
get a refund of the VAT you paid in the other country. Find out more about [
