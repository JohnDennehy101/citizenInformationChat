###  How to register your vehicle

You must [ book an appointment with the NCTS ](https://www.ncts.ie/1230/)
within 7 days of your car's arrival into Ireland and you must complete the
registration process within 30 days of your arrival.

Your vehicle must have an [ electronic Certificate of Conformity
](https://www.revenue.ie/en/online-services/services/vehicle-
services/electronic-certificate-conformity.aspx) (e-CoC) before it is
registered. If you only have a paper version of your e-CoC, you must manually
[ input the details ](https://www.revenue.ie/en/vrt/documents/vrt/ecoc-
procedures-manual.pdf) onto the Revenue system.

You must have a [ Personal Public Service Number ](/en/social-welfare/irish-
social-welfare-system/personal-public-service-number/) (PPS number), proof of
identity (for example your passport or driving licence) and other specified
documents in order to register and pay the VRT. There is a [ list of the
documents required ](https://www.revenue.ie/en/vrt/guide-to-vrt/vehicle-
registration-tax/procedure-at-ncts-centre.aspx) on revenue.ie. You must have
the relevant Foreign Registration Certificate. **If you do not have it,
registration of the vehicle in Ireland will be refused.**

You must also be able to locate the Vehicle Identification Number (VIN number,
this is sometimes called the chassis number) for the vehicle inspector when
presenting the vehicle for inspection.

Once the vehicle has been registered and the VRT paid, you will get:

  * A receipt for the VRT paid showing the registration number assigned to your car. You must display the registration number within 3 days. You can get vehicle registration plates from the NCTS centre or any motor accessories dealer. 
  * A Form RF100 for use when you are applying to pay motor tax. To pay motor tax, you will need to insure the car and have your insurance details. You can pay motor tax online at motortax.ie or at the Motor Taxation Office of your local authority. After you have paid the motor tax, the Vehicle Registration Certificate will be issued to you by the Department of Transport.
