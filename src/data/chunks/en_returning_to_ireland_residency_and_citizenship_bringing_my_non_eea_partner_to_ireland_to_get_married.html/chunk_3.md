You can [ check if you need a visa on our website
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/moving-country/visas-for-ireland/visa-
requirements-for-entering-ireland#l71449) .

If you need a visa, you should apply for a [ marriage (C) short-stay visa
](https://www.visas.inis.gov.ie/avats/OnlineHome.aspx) to come to Ireland to
get married. See ‘How to apply for a marriage visa’ below.

If you are not a citizen of the EEA, UK, or Switzerland and you don’t need a
visa, you still need to bring documents with you to show the reason for your
visit. You must present yourself to border control at point of entry when you
enter Ireland. This is usually at the airport.
