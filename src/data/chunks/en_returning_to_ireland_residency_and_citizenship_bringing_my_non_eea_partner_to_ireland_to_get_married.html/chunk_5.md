###  If you live abroad

If you live outside of Ireland, you should contact a registrar to get
permission to make your 3-month notification by post. If permission is
granted, the registrar will send you a form which you must complete and
return.

You will still have to meet the registrar in person at least 5 days before you
get married to sign the declaration form. The registrar will then give you a
Marriage Registration Form.
