##  Can I stay in Ireland after I ammarried on a marriage visa?

If you arrive in Ireland on a short-stay marriage (C) visa, you cannot stay
for longer than 3 months. You must leave Ireland and apply for another visa if
you want to return.

If you plan to return to Ireland to live with your Irish citizen spouse, you
can [ apply for a Join Family Member (D) visa online
](https://www.visas.inis.gov.ie/avats/OnlineHome.aspx) . When you arrive in
Ireland on your Join Family Member (D) visa, you can then register with
immigration as the spouse of an Irish citizen.
