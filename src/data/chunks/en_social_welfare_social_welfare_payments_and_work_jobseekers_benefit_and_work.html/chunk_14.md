##  Civil partner, spouse or cohabitant working and Jobseeker’s Benefit

Your Jobseeker's Benefit is not affected by your spouse’s, civil partner’s or
cohabitant's income. However, their income can affect whether you get an
increase in your Jobseeker's Benefit payment for him or her as a qualified
adult. The increase in your payment for an adult dependant is called an [
Increase for a Qualified Adult (IQA) ](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-
welfare-system/claiming-a-social-welfare-payment/claiming-an-increase-in-your-
social-welfare-payment-for-an-adult-dependant/) . If your adult dependant is
earning €100 or less, you will get the maximum IQA.

If he or she is earning between €100 and €310, you will get a reduced rate of
IQA. If your adult dependant is earning more than €310, you will not get an
IQA for your adult dependant.
