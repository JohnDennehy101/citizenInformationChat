####  **Self-employment**

To calculate earnings from self-employment the income received in the last
completed tax year is divided by 52 to get the average weekly income. Earnings
are assessed as gross income less allowable expenses over 12 months.

Annual earnings from self-employment are divided by 52 to find your weekly
means from self-employment. Any ‘drawings’ you take from the business is not
an allowable expense.
