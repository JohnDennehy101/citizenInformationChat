###  3\. Casual work or part-time work

You may get Jobseekerâ€™s Benefit if you can only get part-time or casual work.
You must be unemployed for at least 4 days out of a period of 7 consecutive
days and continue to look for full-time employment.

For each day you are employed, 1/5th of the normal rate of Jobseeker's Benefit
is deducted from your weekly payment, provided that you are unemployed for at
least 4 days out of a period of 7 consecutive days. For example, if you get
casual work for 2 days, you can get 3/5ths of the normal Jobseeker's Benefit
for that week.

You must claim Jobseeker's Benefit for at least 3 days in any week. If you get
4 days' work, Jobseeker's Benefit is **not** paid at all.

Normally you cannot get Jobseeker's Benefit for a day on which you do casual
or part-time work, unless, it comes within the subsidiary work rules (see
below).
