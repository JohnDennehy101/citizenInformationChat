####  Jobseeker's Benefit for part-time workers

**Days worked** |  **Effective days of unemployment** |  **Weekly payment for a single person** |  **Weekly payment for a couple with 1 child under 12**  
---|---|---|---  
0  |  6  |  €232  |  €432   
1  |  5  |  €185.60  |  €345.60   
2  |  4  |  €139.20  |  €259.20   
3  |  3  |  €92.80  |  €172.80   
  
If you work 4 days you are no longer entitled to claim JB (because you must be
unemployed for 4 out of 7 days).

**Note:** Jobseeker’s Benefit is paid for 234 days or 156 days depending on
how many PRSI contributions you have paid. You are considered to be unemployed
for 6 days out of the 7-day social welfare employment week. If you are fully
unemployed you would use up your entitlement to Jobseeker’s Benefit after
either 9 months (6 days of unemployment per week x 39 equals 234 days) or 6
months (6 days of unemployment per week x 26 equals 156 days).

However, if you are working part time your entitlement to Jobseeker’s Benefit
may last longer. For example, if you are entitled to 234 days JB (39 weeks)
and you are working for 2 days a week and unemployed for the remaining 4 days
you could continue to claim Jobseeker’s Benefit for 58.5 weeks. If you were
working for 3 days a week you would use 3 days of your total JB entitlement
and you could continue to claim JB for 78 weeks.
