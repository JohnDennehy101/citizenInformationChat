###  4\. Subsidiary employment

As a general rule, you will not get Jobseeker's Benefit for any day you are
employed or self-employed. However, it is possible to do some subsidiary work
and still get Jobseeker's Benefit for the day in question.

Subsidiary work is work that could have been done while you were in full-time
employment and outside your normal working hours. For example, you may work a
full-time job during the day and have a part-time job in the evening. The
part-time job is known as subsidiary or secondary employment if you were able
to do the part-time work without it affecting your full-time job for a period
of at least 6 months.

If you have subsidiary employment, you should always check with the Department
of Social Protection to see whether or not your Jobseeker's Benefit will be
affected.

If you have less than 117 paid PRSI contributions in the 3 years before
becoming unemployed, you may not earn more than €144 per week (€7,500 over 12
months) from subsidiary employment. There is no earnings limit if you have
more than 117 paid PRSI contributions.

If you are a farmer with other full-time employment, your farming will be your
subsidiary employment.
