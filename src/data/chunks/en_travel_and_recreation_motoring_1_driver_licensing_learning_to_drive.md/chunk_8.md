###  Rules

**A learner permit is not a full driving licence** and you must keep to
several important restrictions when driving on a learner permit in any type of
vehicle. You must:

  * **Be accompanied when driving** . If you hold a learner permit for a car, truck or bus, you must be accompanied and supervised at all times by a qualified driver. A qualified driver is a person who has held a full driving licence in the same category for a continuous period of 2 years. If you hold a learner permit for a motorcycle, you must complete your [ Initial Basic Training (IBT) ](https://www.rsa.ie/en/RSA/Learner-Drivers/Motorcyclists/Initial-basic-training-IBT-for-motorcyclists/) before you can drive unsupervised (see ‘Practice Driving’ below for further information). 
  * **Display L plates.** Learner permit holders for all categories (except work vehicles) must display ‘L’ plates while they are driving. Learner permit holders for motorcycles must display ‘L’ plates on a yellow fluorescent vest that is clearly visible on the front and back of the driver’s body. 
  * **Stay off motorways** . As a learner permit holder, you are not permitted to drive on a motorway. 
  * **Not tow trailers** . Certain learner permit holders driving cars, trucks or buses must not tow a trailer. Read more about [ learner permits for trailers ](/en/travel-and-recreation/motoring-1/driver-licensing/learner-driving-permits-for-cars-and-work-vehicles#l7d405) . 
  * **Not carry passengers for payment** . As a learner permit holder, you must not carry any passenger for payment or reward. If you hold a learner permit for a motorcycle, you cannot carry any passengers until you pass your test. 
  * **Keep to disqualification thresholds** . As a learner permit holder driving any type of vehicle, you must keep to a [ reduced drink driving limit ](/en/travel-and-recreation/motoring/driving-offences/drink-driving-offences-in-ireland/) and [ penalty point disqualification ](/en/travel-and-recreation/motoring/driving-offences/penalty-points-for-driving-offences/) threshold.
