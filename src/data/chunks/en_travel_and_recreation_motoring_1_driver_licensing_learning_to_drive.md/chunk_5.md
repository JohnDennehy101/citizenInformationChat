##  Step 2: Get a learner permit

When you pass your theory test, you should [ apply to the NDLS for a learner
permit ](https://www.ndls.ie/how-to-apply/learner-permit.html) . A learner
permit allows you to learn to drive on public roads in Ireland and you must
always have it with you when you are driving.

You cannot take driving lessons without a valid learner permit and, in most
cases, you cannot take a driving test until you have had your first learner
permit for [ at least 6 months. ](https://www.rsa.ie/en/RSA/Learner-
