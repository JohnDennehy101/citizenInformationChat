###  Essential Driver Training (EDT)

EDT is a training course that teaches fundamental driving skills to learner
car drivers. The RSA has published [ detailed guidance on EDT (pdf)
](https://www.rsa.ie/docs/default-source/services/s1.2-get-
qualified/essential-driver-training-a5-mar19-v4.pdf?sfvrsn=4f5a68f2_5) . The
course is made up of 12 individual 1 hour sessions.

At each EDT session, your ADI will check your learner permit and record the
session with a stamp and signature in your official EDT logbook. You must
produce [ your completed EDT logbook (pdf) ](https://www.rsa.ie/docs/default-
source/services/s1.2-get-qualified/edt-learner-logbook.pdf?sfvrsn=210f2346_5)
on the day of the driving test.

You can also [ nominate a sponsor ](https://www.rsa.ie/services/learner-
drivers/driving-lessons/car-driving-lessons-\(edt\)) to accompany you during
your EDT sessions. Your sponsor should be an experienced licence holder who
can support you in preparing for your test.

If you have a full driving licence from a country that does not have a [
licence exchange agreement ](/en/travel-and-recreation/motoring/driver-
licensing/exchanging-foreign-driving-permit/) with Ireland, you will only be
required to complete 6 EDT sessions before taking the Irish driving test. The
RSA has published a [ detailed handbook on Reduced EDT (pdf)
](https://www.rsa.ie/docs/default-source/services/s1.8-learner-driver-
resources/reduced-edt-information-booklet.pdf?sfvrsn=db5fc51e_0) .
