###  **Finding training**

The grants can cover training services if identified under a Workplace Needs
Assessment. The Department of Social Protection (DSP) will pay the training
costs directly to the service provider.

The training must not be available through the DSP directly or any other state
provider (for example Solas or ETBs, Teagasc).
