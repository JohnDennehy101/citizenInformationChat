  * Occupational physician 
  * Occupational health nurse 
  * Ergonomic specialist 
  * Chartered physiotherapist who may provide once-off or occasional consultations 

LÃ¡mh support workers must be qualified or experienced (or both).

There is no pre-approved list of specialist providers. Specialists should be
registered with a relevant professional body such as [ the Register of Health
and Social Care Professionals (CORU) ](https://www.coru.ie/) or [ the
Association of Occupational Therapists. ](https://www.aoti.ie/)

Specialists who work for the employer or companies connected to the employer
are not eligible for funding.
