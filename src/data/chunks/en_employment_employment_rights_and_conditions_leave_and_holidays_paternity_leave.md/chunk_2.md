##  What is paternity leave?

Paternity leave gives new parents 2 weeks off work. You can take time off if
you are employed or self-employed, and can start the leave any time in the
first 6 months after the baby's birth. You can also take paternity leave when
you adopt a child.

Usually, fathers take paternity leave. Paternity leave is also available to
same-sex couples.

Your employer does not have to pay you during paternity leave, but you may
qualify for Paternity Benefit.

The legislation on paternity leave is set out in the [ Paternity Leave and
Benefit Act 2016
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2016/act/11/enacted/en/html) .
