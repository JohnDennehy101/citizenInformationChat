###  Your employer

Employers do not have to pay employees who are on paternity leave. You should
check your contract of employment to see whether you can get pay and pension
contributions from your employer during paternity leave.

Your contract could give you the right to pay from your employer, in addition
to Paternity Benefit while you are on paternity leave. For example, your
employer may top up the amount you get from Paternity Benefit to match your
normal pay.
