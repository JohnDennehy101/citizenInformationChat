##  Who can take paternity leave?

Relevant parents can take paternity leave. These are:

  * The father of the child 
  * The partner (spouse, civil partner or cohabitant) of the mother of the child 
  * The parent of a donor-conceived child 

For an adopted child, the relevant parent is the **parent who is not the**
**_qualifying adopter_ ** for adoptive leave. This means one of you can take
adoption leave and the other paternity leave. If you are adopting alone you
can take paternity leave if you are not taking adoptive leave.

You can take 2 weeksâ€™ paternity leave from full-time, casual or part-time
employment. It does not matter how long you have been working for your
employer or how many hours you work a week.
