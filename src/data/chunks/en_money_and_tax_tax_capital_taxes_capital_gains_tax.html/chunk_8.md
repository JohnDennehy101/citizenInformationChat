###  Farm or business

If you are over 55 and disposing of business or farm assets, you may be able
to get CGT relief. This is called Retirement Relief but you do not have to
retire from the business or farm.

The exemption limits depend on your age and whether the disposal is to your
child or to someone outside your family.
