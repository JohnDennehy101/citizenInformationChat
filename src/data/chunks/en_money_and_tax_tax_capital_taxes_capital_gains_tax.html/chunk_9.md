###  Property acquired between 7 December 2011 and 31 December 2014

If you dispose of land or buildings you acquired between 7 December 2011 and
31 December 2014, you can get relief from CGT in certain cases.

If the property is held for more than 7 years, relief will be given for the
first 7 years.

If the property was held for less than 7 years but more than 4 years, and was
disposed of after 1 January 2018, it is exempt from CGT.

For example, if the property was bought in January 2012 and sold in January
2022, the property would have been held for 10 years, so 7/10 of any gain will
be relieved from CGT and 3/10 is taxable.
