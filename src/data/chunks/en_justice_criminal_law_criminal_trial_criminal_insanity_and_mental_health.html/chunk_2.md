##  Information

People who are charged with a criminal offence and who are suffering from a
mental disorder are dealt with under the [ Criminal Law (Insanity) Act 2006
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2006/act/11/enacted/en/html) as amended
by the [ Criminal Law (Insanity) Act 2010
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2010/en/act/pub/0040/index.html) .

The question of the mental state of someone charged with a crime may arise at
2 different stages - at the start of the trial and at the decision on guilt.
If a person is suffering from a mental disorder, they may be considered unfit
to be tried at the start of the trial. In that case, no trial goes ahead. If a
trial is held and the person is considered to have actually committed the
offence but was insane at the time, it is possible for a verdict of not guilty
by reason of insanity to be reached. In murder cases, the concept of
diminished responsibility may be used to substitute a verdict of manslaughter.

A mental disorder is defined in the 2006 Act as including mental illness,
mental disability, dementia or any disease of the mind but does not include
intoxication (drunkenness).
