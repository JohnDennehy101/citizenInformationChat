##  Diminished responsibility in murder cases

If someone is charged with murder, the verdict of not guilty by reason of
insanity is one possible verdict. [ The Criminal Law (Insanity) Act 2006
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2006/act/11/enacted/en/html) provides for
the concept of diminished responsibility in murder cases. The verdict is
available where someone does not meet the test for a verdict of not guilty by
reason of insanity but still was suffering from a mental disorder which
substantially diminished his or her responsibility for the killing.

A conviction for murder brings an automatic life sentence. In other crimes,
the judge has discretion in relation to sentencing and so can take into
account any diminished responsibility which may exist. If someone charged with
murder successfully pleads diminished responsibility, then the verdict is
manslaughter. The judge can then sentence the person to any appropriate length
of time in prison.
