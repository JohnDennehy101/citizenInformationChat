##  Fit or unfit to be tried

The decision on whether or not a person is fit to be tried is made by a judge.
If the person cannot understand the charge or is unable to instruct a legal
team, challenge jurors or follow the evidence, then they may be considered
unfit to be tried.

This finding (that is that someone is considered unfit to be tried) is not a
decision on the alleged criminal activity. If someone is found to be unfit to
be tried, then the trial is postponed. The judge then decides what happens
next. For example, the person may be committed to a psychiatric hospital or
unit if they are considered to be suffering from a mental disorder and are in
need of in-patient treatment under the terms of the Mental Health Act, 2001.
Alternatively, the person may be sent for out-patient psychiatric care. The
person may be committed to a psychiatric hospital or unit for 14 days in order
to establish whether or not they should be sent for treatment. The person may
appeal against a committal order.

If the judge considers that a person is unfit to be tried and that there is a
reasonable doubt that the person committed the alleged crime, the person may
be acquitted. The Director of Public Prosecutions or the accused person may
appeal against a decision that they are unfit to be tried.
