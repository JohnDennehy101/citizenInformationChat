###  Main carer for a child

The child must normally live with you. If they live with the other parent of
the child (or some other person) for part of the week, you can still qualify
for JST. The child must live with you for the greater part of the week.

You cannot get JST if you have joint equal custody of the child. Joint custody
means that the child lives equally between you and their other parent.
