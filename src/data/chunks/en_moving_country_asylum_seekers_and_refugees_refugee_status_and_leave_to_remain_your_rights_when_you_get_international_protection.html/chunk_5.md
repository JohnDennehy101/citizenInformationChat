##  Housing

Your direct provision normally ends when you get your declaration, but
sometimes you can stay in [ direct provision ](/en/moving-country/asylum-
seekers-and-refugees/services-for-asylum-seekers-in-ireland/direct-provision/)
while you are looking for your own place to live.

You can [ apply for social housing ](/en/housing/local-authority-and-social-
housing/applying-for-local-authority-housing/) or look for [ private rented
accommodation ](/en/housing/renting-a-home/looking-for-a-flat-or-house-to-
rent/) .
