###  Private rented accommodation

If you are on a low income, the [ Housing Assistance Payment (HAP)
](/en/housing/renting-a-home/help-with-renting/housing-assistance-payment/)
can help with your rent. You must find your own private rented accommodation
and then apply to the local authority for the payment. The local authority
makes the HAP payment to your landlord on your behalf. You pay a weekly HAP
rent contribution to the local authority, based on your householdâ€™s weekly
income and your ability to pay.
