  * Notice of Tax Registration Form 

If you are an employee and you use your vehicle solely for the carriage of
goods in the course of your employment, you will need a letter from your
employer that states this. The letter should also provide information about
your employer, such as, the nature of the business and its Tax Registration
Number.

If the vehicle is one year old or over (for example, imported) a certificate
of roadworthiness/pass statement (from an authorised tester) is required. If
the vehicle is imported, a weight docket (from an authorised weighbridge) is
required.
