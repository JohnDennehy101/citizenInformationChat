###  Taxing your car for the first time

If you are taxing your car for the first time, you need to make sure that your
name is on the Vehicle Registration Certificate (VRC). A registered dealer
will do this, but if it’s a private sale, make sure the seller completes and
signs the change of ownership section so that a new VRC can be sent to you.
Without a VRC, you can’t tax your new car.
