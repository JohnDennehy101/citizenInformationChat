##  What is Maternity Benefit?

Maternity Benefit is a payment made to women who are on [ maternity leave
](/en/employment/employment-rights-and-conditions/leave-and-
holidays/maternity-leave/) from work and covered by [ social insurance (PRSI)
](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/social-insurance-prsi/social-
insurance/) .

You should apply for Maternity Benefit at least 6 weeks before you plan to go
on maternity leave (12 weeks if you are self-employed).

Some employers will continue to pay you on maternity leave and request that
your Maternity Benefit be paid to them. You should check your contract of
employment to see what applies to you.

If you are already getting a social welfare payment and working, you may get
half-rate Maternity Benefit – see ‘Half-rate Maternity Benefit’ below.
