####  Getting your Maternity Benefit early

To bring forward the start date of your Maternity Benefit to the date of your
baby’s birth, you need to give the Department of Social Protection (DSP)
either a copy of your baby’s birth certificate or a letter from the hospital
confirming the baby’s actual date of birth.
