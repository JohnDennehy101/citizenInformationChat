####  **How many PRSI contributions do I need?**

**If you are employed** , you must have:

  * At least 39 weeks of PRSI paid in the 12-month period before the first day of your maternity leave 

Or

  * At least 39 weeks of PRSI paid since first starting work and at least 39 weeks of PRSI paid or credited in the relevant tax year or in the tax year after the relevant tax year. For example, if you are going on maternity leave in 2024, the relevant tax year is 2022 and the year after that is 2023. 

Or

  * At least 26 weeks of PRSI paid in the relevant tax year and at least 26 weeks PRSI paid in the tax year before the relevant tax year. For example, if you are going on maternity leave in 2024, the relevant tax year is 2022 and the year before that is 2021. 

If you do not meet these PRSI conditions and you were self-employed before
starting work as an employee, you might meet the contribution conditions for
the self-employed in the relevant tax year – see below.

**If you are self-employed,** you must be in insurable employment and have:

  * 52 weeks of PRSI contributions paid at Class S in the relevant tax year. For example, if you are going on maternity leave in 2024, the relevant tax year is 2022. 

Or

  * 52 weeks of PRSI contributions paid at Class S in the tax year before the relevant tax year. For example, if you are going on maternity leave in 2024, the tax year before the relevant tax year is 2021. 

Or

  * 52 weeks of PRSI contributions paid at Class S in the tax year after the relevant tax year. For example, if you are going on maternity leave in 2024, the tax year after the relevant tax year is 2023. 

PRSI Class S contributions for a particular year are not awarded until you
have paid tax due for that year. To qualify for Maternity Benefit, your income
tax and PRSI liabilities (importantly for the relevant tax year) must be paid.

If you do not meet these PRSI conditions and you were in insurable employment
before becoming self-employed, you might meet the contribution conditions for
employees in the relevant tax year – see PRSI conditions for employed people
above.

**If you worked in another country**

If you were employed in the UK or a country covered by EU Regulations and you
have paid at least one full-rate PRSI contribution in Ireland, you can [
combine your insurance record in that country with your Irish PRSI
contributions ](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/claiming-a-
social-welfare-payment/social-insurance-contributions-from-abroad/) to help
you qualify for Maternity Benefit. To do this, you must be in insurable
employment in Ireland currently and have paid your most recent PRSI
contribution in Ireland
