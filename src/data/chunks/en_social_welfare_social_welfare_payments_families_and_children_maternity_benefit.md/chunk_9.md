###  Premature births

If your baby is born premature (before the date you were due to start your
maternity leave) your Maternity Benefit is paid for 26 weeks from the date of
your baby’s birth plus an extra period after the end of 26 weeks. The extra
Maternity Benefit will be the same as the time between your baby’s actual
birth date and the expected start date of your maternity leave and Maternity
Benefit.

Maternity leave is also extended for this extra period.
