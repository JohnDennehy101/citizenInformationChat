####  Sheltered accommodation

If you live in sheltered accommodation, you may qualify for the Living Alone
Increase if you are regarded as living independently within the institution.
You can find a [ list of hostels and homes where the Living Alone Increase is
payable ](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/4df03c-list-of-hostels-and-homes-
where-living-alone-increase-is-payable/) on Gov.ie.

You will **not** qualify if you share dormitory accommodation with others or
have round-the clock supervision or nursing care.

People who live in nursing homes will **not** qualify as they cannot be
regarded as living completely or mainly alone.
