###  Start-up Entrepreneur Programme

The Start-up Entrepreneur Programme (STEP) allows a non-EEA national with an
innovative business idea and minimum funding of €50,000 to come and set up a
business in Ireland. The aim of the Programme is to support [ High Potential
Start-Ups ](https://www.enterprise-ireland.com/en/Start-a-Business-in-
Ireland/Do-I-qualify-as-a-HPSU-/) which are defined as start-up ventures that
are:

  * Introducing a new or innovative product or service to international markets 
  * Involved in manufacturing or internationally traded services 
  * Capable of creating 10 jobs in Ireland and realising €1 million in sales within three to four years of starting up 
  * Led by an experienced management team 
  * Headquartered and controlled in Ireland 
  * Less than 5 years old 

The STEP scheme does not apply to retail, catering, personal services or
similar businesses. No initial job creation targets will be set as it is
recognised that such businesses can take some time to get off the ground.
There is detailed information in the [ Start-up Entrepreneur Programme
Guidelines. ](https://www.irishimmigration.ie/start-up-entrepreneur-programme-
