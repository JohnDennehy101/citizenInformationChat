##  Complain about a breach of working hours or rest breaks

If you have a complaint about a breach of your employment rights, you should
first discuss it with your employer. If you cannot resolve your complaint, you
can make a complaint under the Protection of Young Persons (Employment) Act
1996 to the [ Inspection Services of the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC)
](/en/employment/enforcement-and-redress/enforcement-employment-rights-
legislation/) .

If you think you have been penalised for refusing to co-operate with an
employer in breaching the Act (for example, by refusing to work prohibited
hours), then your parent or guardian can [ make a complaint to a WRC
adjudicator ](/en/employment/enforcement-and-redress/adjudication-employment-
rights-disputes-and-complaints/) on your behalf.

You should make the complaint within 6 months of the event, using the WRCâ€™s [
online complaint form
](https://www.workplacerelations.ie/en/Complaints_Disputes/Refer_a_Dispute_Make_a_Complaint/)
.
