###  **Can I keep my jobseeker’s payment?**

Yes, you keep your jobseeker's payment while on JobPath. However, your payment
may be affected if you don’t engage with the programme.

If you are registered with Jobpath, you can apply for employment support
schemes such as [ Tús
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/employment/unemployment-and-
redundancy/employment-support-schemes/tus/) or [ Community Employment
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/employment/unemployment-and-
redundancy/employment-support-schemes/community-employment-scheme/) .

Depending on your Intreo Centre, while you are on JobPath you may sign on for
your jobseeker's payment less often than before. In some situations, you may
not have to sign on at all.
