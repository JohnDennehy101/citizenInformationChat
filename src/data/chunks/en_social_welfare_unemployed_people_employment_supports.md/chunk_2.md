##  Who is a jobseeker?

You are a jobseeker if you are:

  * Getting [ Jobseeker’s Benefit ](/en/social-welfare/unemployed-people/jobseekers-benefit/) or [ Jobseeker’s Allowance ](/en/social-welfare/unemployed-people/jobseekers-allowance/)
  * [ Signing on ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/unemployed-people/signing-on/) for unemployment credits 
  * Unemployed, but not eligible for a social welfare payment, or 
  * Unemployed, looking for work and getting a social welfare payment. 

As a jobseeker, you can contact your [ local Intreo Centre
](https://www.gov.ie/en/directory/category/e1f4b5-intreo-offices/) for
employment support, including advice about looking for work, information on
job vacancies, and income support.

People getting Jobseeker’s Benefit or Jobseeker’s Allowance are prioritised
for employment supports.

If you are getting a jobseeker’s payment, you may have to participate in an
activation programme – see ‘Jobseeker’s payments and activation’ below.
