##  Extra information: How to find your spouse's, civil partner's or
cohabitant's weekly means from work

To calculate your spouse's, civil partner's or cohabitant's weekly means from
work first calculate his/her assessable earnings.

The following items are always deducted from his/her gross earnings to get
assessable earnings:

  * PRSI (Contribution) 
  * Union dues 
  * Superannuation 
  * PRSA (Personal Retirement Savings Account) 
  * AVCs (Additional Voluntary Contributions) 

Deduct €20 per day from your spouse's/civil partner's/cohabitant's assessable
earnings for each day worked up to a maximum of €60 (including Sunday).

Next get 60% of the balance. This is assessed as his/her weekly means.

Assessable weekly earnings - €20 per day (maximum 3 days) = total x 60% =
weekly means from work.

**Your means are halved** if your spouse, civil partner or cohabitant is:

  * Getting a social welfare payment (except Child Benefit, Disablement Pension, guardian's payment, Supplementary Welfare Allowance, Domiciliary Care Allowance and half-rate Carer's Allowance) 
  * On a FET or VTOS course and getting an allowance in his or her own right. 

If your means are halved because of the above, you will not get an increase
for a qualified adult but you will get a half-rate increase for each qualified
child.

**Community Employment:** If you are getting Jobseeker's Allowance and your
spouse, civil partner or cohabitant starts a Community Employment (CE) Scheme
in 2023, the maximum Jobseeker’s Allowance payment will not include an
increase for an [ adult dependant ](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-
system/claiming-a-social-welfare-payment/claiming-an-increase-in-your-social-
welfare-payment-for-an-adult-dependant/) , but it will include a full-rate
increase for each qualified child. Half of your combined means are taken into
account in the means test.

**Example**  
---  
Partner's assessable weekly earnings are €150 per week. Partner works 3 days
(Wednesday, Friday and Sunday).  €150 - €60 = €90 x 60% = €54  Partner's
weekly means from work = €54
