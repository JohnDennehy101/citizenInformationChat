###  Step 1: Assessable weekly earnings

Find your assessable weekly earnings.

The following items are always deducted from your gross earnings to get your
assessable earnings:

  * PRSI Contribution 
  * Union dues 
  * Superannuation 
  * PRSA (Personal Retirement Savings Account) 
  * AVCs (Additional Voluntary Contributions) 

**Example**  
---  
Jim is a single man aged 27. He works 3 days (Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday)
and gets €50 per day. His assessable weekly earnings are €150. We will assume
he is not paying any contribution towards superannuation, union dues, PRSA or
AVC. He does not pay [ PRSI
](../../../../social_welfare/irish_social_welfare_system/social_insurance_prsi/social_insurance_in_ireland.html)
because his earnings are less than €352.  Assessable weekly earnings = €150
