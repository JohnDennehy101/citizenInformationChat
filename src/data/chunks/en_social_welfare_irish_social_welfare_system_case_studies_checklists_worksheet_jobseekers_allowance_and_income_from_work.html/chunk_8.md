###  Step 5: Weekly means from work

Multiply your daily means by the number of days worked (including Sunday). If
you get paid for a public holiday and don't work that day, it will be included
in the number of days worked.

Daily means from work x number of days worked = weekly means from work.

**Your means are halved** if your spouse/civil partner/cohabitant is:

  * Getting a social welfare payment (except Child Benefit, Disablement Pension, guardian's payment, Supplementary Welfare Allowance, Domiciliary Care Allowance and half-rate Carer's Allowance) 
  * On a FET or VTOS course and getting an allowance in his or her own right. 

If your means are halved because of the above, you will not get an increase
for a qualified adult but you will get a half-rate increase for each qualified
child.

**Community Employment:** If you are getting Jobseeker's Allowance and your
spouse, civil partner or cohabitant starts a Community Employment (CE) Scheme
in 2023, the maximum Jobseeker’s Allowance payment will not include an
increase for an [ adult dependant ](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-
system/claiming-a-social-welfare-payment/claiming-an-increase-in-your-social-
welfare-payment-for-an-adult-dependant/) , but it will include a full-rate
increase for each qualified child. Half of your combined means are taken into
account in the means test.

**Example**  
---  
Jim works 3 days and get €50 per day. His average daily earnings are €50. His
daily means from work is €18 (see Step 4).  €18 x 3 days = €54  Weekly means
from work = €54
