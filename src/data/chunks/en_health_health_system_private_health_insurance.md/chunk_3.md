###  **Restricted member schemes**

There are also some health insurance providers that deal only with particular
groups of employees, for example, Garda√≠ or prison officers.

These schemes are known as restricted membership schemes. The rules governing
health insurance apply equally to all providers, with some limited exceptions
for the restricted membership schemes.

You can have a [ medical card

cards/medical-card/) and private health insurance at the same time. If you get
a referral from your GP, you must decide if you want to be treated as a public
or private patient.
