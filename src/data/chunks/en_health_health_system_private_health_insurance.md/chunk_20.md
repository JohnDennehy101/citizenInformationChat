###  **Upgrade waiting periods**

If you are switching health insurance plans, you may have to wait for up to 2
years for use of any higher benefit on the new plan.

For maternity benefits, the maximum waiting period is 52 weeks.

Insurance companies do not always apply the maximum waiting periods. You
should check with your insurer about their waiting periods.
