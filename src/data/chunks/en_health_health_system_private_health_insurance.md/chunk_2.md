##  Introduction

Health insurance is used to pay for private care in hospital or from health
professionals in hospitals or in their practices.

Before accessing a health service or getting a referral from a GP for a
particular hospital or clinic, you should contact your insurer directly to
check that the health service and hospital or clinic are actually covered
under your policy. If you are not covered by your insurance, you may have to
pay for the treatment yourself.

Depending on which insurance company you are using, they may pay the hospital
directly, if you are admitted into hospital.

If you are a private patient using the [ out-patient service
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/health/health-services/gp-and-
hospital-services/hospital-charges/#cd0fda) at a hospital, you may have to pay
the health professional and then claim back from the health insurance company.
You should ask your own company about their procedures.
