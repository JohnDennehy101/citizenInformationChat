##  Waiting periods

The health insurance company cannot refuse to accept you on the basis of your
health status.

When you take out health insurance for the first time, you may have to serve a
waiting period before you are fully covered, but accident and injury will be
covered immediately.

If you are changing to a health insurance plan with improved benefits there
may be a waiting period before the higher benefits apply.

The Health Insurance Authority (HIA) lists the [ current waiting periods that
are applied by insurers ](https://www.hia.ie/consumer-information/waiting-
periods/new-customer-waiting-periods) .

There are 2 types of waiting period:

  * **New customer waiting periods** for the first time you take out health insurance, or if you have a gap in cover of more than 13 weeks 
  * **Upgrade waiting periods** if you are switching to a plan with higher cover
