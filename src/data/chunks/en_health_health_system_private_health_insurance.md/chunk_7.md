####  **Switching insurers**

In general, health insurance policies are 12-month contracts. All insurers
must provide a 14-day cooling-off period from the start of the contract.
During these 14 days, you can cancel or switch insurance company and get a
full refund. No claims will be paid for these 14 days. See below for more
information about waiting periods when you switch.
