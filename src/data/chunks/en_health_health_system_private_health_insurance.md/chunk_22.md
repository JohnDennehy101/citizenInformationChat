####  **Cooling-off period**

All insurers must provide a 14-day cooling off period from the start of the
contract. The cooling off period of 14 days is when you can cancel and get a
full refund. No claims are paid for these 14 days.

If you are experiencing problems with getting cover, you should contact the
Health Insurance Authority (HIA).
