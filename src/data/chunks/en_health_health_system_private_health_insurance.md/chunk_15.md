##  **4 Minimum level of health insurance benefits**

Private insurers must offer a minimum level of cover.

Companies that offer cover for inpatient hospital services must offer a
minimum level of cover for:

  * Day care/inpatient treatment 
  * Hospital outpatient treatment 
  * Maternity benefits 
  * Convalescence 
  * Psychiatric treatment and substance abuse 

The minimum covered accommodation level is a semi-private room in a public
hospital, although this may not always be available if you are admitted to
hospital.

This does not apply to [ cash plans (pdf

or out-patient only plans.
