####  Lifetime community rating

Lifetime community rating means that the amount you pay for health insurance
does not depend on the age you are now but can be higher depending on the age
you were when you first took out health insurance. This applies only to people
from age 35 and above.

For example, a 50-year-old who has held insurance since they were aged 30
would pay the same as a 30-year-old, but a 50-year-old who purchases insurance
for the first time would pay more than a 30-year-old.
