##  3\. Community rating

Community rating means that the insurance company must charge the same rate
for a particular level of service, regardless of your age, sex, health status
or medical history. So, all adults pay the same amount for the same benefits.

Unlike motor insurance or life insurance, your age, health or past record of
claims do not affect the price charged for insurance.

Charges may be lower than the normal adult rate for:

  * People aged under 25 
  * Retired people with a special arrangement within their company's health insurance scheme 
  * People in group health insurance schemes 

Charges for children must be reduced by at least 50% of the adult premium.
