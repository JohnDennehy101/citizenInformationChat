All workers are entitled to have breaks while they are at work and rest
periods between working days or nights. This page will help you understand
what work breaks and rest periods you are entitled to by law.

Minimum break and rest period entitlements are set out in the [ Organisation
of Working Time Act 1997
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1997/en/act/pub/0020/index.html) . These
rules apply to most workers but there are some exceptions – see ‘exceptions
and special circumstances’ below.
