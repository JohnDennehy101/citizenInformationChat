####  **Weekly rest period (‘days off’)**

Weekly rest are whole days when you don’t come into work, usually called
‘days’ off’.

You have the right to either:

  * A weekly rest period of 24 consecutive hours in any 7 days, following a daily rest period (should be a Sunday, unless your contract says something different) 
  * Two 24-hour rest periods in a week if it follows a week, in which you did not get any 24-hour rest periods (should include a Sunday, unless your contract says something different)
