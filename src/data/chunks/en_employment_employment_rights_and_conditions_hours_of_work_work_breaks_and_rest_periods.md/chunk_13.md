###  Exceptions to getting normal breaks

In some cases the normal rules will not apply:

  * **Exceptional circumstances** : for example an emergency or an accident or some other unforeseeable event outside your employers control 
  * **Collective agreement** to change rest periods: These changes must be approved by the Labour Court or if there is an [ Employment Regulation Order or Registered Employment Agreement ](/en/employment/employment-rights-and-conditions/industrial-relations-and-trade-unions/employment-agreements-and-orders/)
  * **Shift work** : in certain circumstances, for example, if you work split shifts or changing shifts 

Instead of getting normal breaks, you are entitled to _compensatory rest_ .
This means a rest period taken later, if possible before the end of the day.
The Workplace Relations Commission has a [ Code of Practice on Compensatory
Rest Periods
](https://www.workplacerelations.ie/en/what_you_should_know/codes_practice/cop8/)
.
