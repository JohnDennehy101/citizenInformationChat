##  Make a complaint

If you have an issue about breaks or rest periods, you should raise it with
your employer first. If you cannot resolve the issue directly with your
employer, you can make a formal complaint to the [ Workplace Relations
Commission ](https://www.workplacerelations.ie/en/contact_us/contact-details/)
. You should apply using the [ online complaint form
](https://www.workplacerelations.ie/en/Complaints_Disputes/Refer_a_Dispute_Make_a_Complaint/)
.

You should make a complaint **within 6 months** of the dispute taking place.
The time limit may be extended for up to a further 6 months, if there was
reasonable cause for the delay.
