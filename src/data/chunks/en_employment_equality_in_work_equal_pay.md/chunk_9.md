###  Raise an informal or formal complaint with your employer

If you think you are not being paid equal pay for your ‘like work’, you should
raise the matter informally with management through the internal grievance
procedure in the first place.

If not resolved, you can use the formal process to pursue the pay issue. If
you are not happy with the outcome of this procedure you have the option of
lodging a claim with the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC) or to the
Circuit Court (in a gender claim).
