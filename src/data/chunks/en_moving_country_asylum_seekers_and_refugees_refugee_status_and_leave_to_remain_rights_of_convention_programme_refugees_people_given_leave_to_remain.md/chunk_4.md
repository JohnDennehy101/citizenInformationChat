###  Permission to remain

If you were not declared a refugee or a person with subsidiary protection
status, the Minister for Justice may grant you [ permission to remain
](/en/moving-country/asylum-seekers-and-refugees/refugee-status-and-leave-to-
remain/permission-to-remain/) in Ireland. You have most of the rights that are
listed above. You do not have the same right to family reunification as a
person with a refugee or subsidiary protection declaration. Your family can [
apply for a visa to join you ](/en/moving-country/moving-to-ireland/rights-of-
residence-in-ireland/residence-rights-of-family-members#l84390) , but you must
satisfy conditions for the visa to be granted.

You can also only get a travel document if you cannot get a national passport.
