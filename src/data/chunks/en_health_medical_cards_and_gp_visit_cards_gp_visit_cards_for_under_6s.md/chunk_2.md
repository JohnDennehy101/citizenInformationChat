##  What is the GP visit card for children?

If your child is under the age of 8, you can get a GP visit card for them.
With the GP visit card, your child can visit a participating GP (family
doctor) for free and get free specific assessments (see ‘What is covered’
below).

**Children aged 6 and 7 now qualify**

The GP visit card for children was initially only available for children under
the age of 6. On 11 August 2023, it was extended to children who are 6 and 7.
If your child is 6 or 7, you can [ register online for a GP visit card

If your child turned 6 after 1 July 2023, their GP visit card will be extended
automatically by the HSE and you do not need to register again.
