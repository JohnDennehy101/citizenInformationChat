###  **If your own home is not suitable for you to live in**

You may be able to get a specially adapted local authority house for older
people and people with disabilities, or an adapted house provided by a
voluntary housing organisation.

The availability of such houses, and eligibility for them, varies around the
country. Contact [ your local authority
