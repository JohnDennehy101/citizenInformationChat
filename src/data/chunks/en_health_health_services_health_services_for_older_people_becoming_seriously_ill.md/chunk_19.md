###  GP visit card

If you do not qualify for a medical card, you can apply for a [ GP visit card
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/health/medical-cards-and-gp-visit-
cards/gp-visit-cards/) . The GP visit card has higher income limits than the
medical card. If you are aged over 70, you can get a GP visit card without a
means test.

If your carer gets [ Carer’s Benefit ](/en/social-welfare/carers/carers-
benefit/) or [ Carer’s Allowance ](/en/social-welfare/carers/carers-
allowance/) , either at full or half-rate, they can get a GP visit card too.
