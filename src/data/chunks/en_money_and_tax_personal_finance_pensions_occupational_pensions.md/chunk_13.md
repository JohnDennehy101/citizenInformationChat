##  Pension scheme rules

Pension schemes can set their own rules about contributions and benefits.
However, there are some rules set out in legislation which they must follow.

**Preservation and transfer of benefits**

There are specific rules about what happens if you leave the pension scheme,
for example, if you change jobs or you become self-employed or retire early
without a pension. Your benefits from the pension scheme may be preserved
within the scheme or transferred to another scheme. If you have at least 2
year's service, you are entitled to a preserved benefit if you leave before
the normal retirement age. A preserved benefit means that you get a pension
when you reach the scheme's normal retirement age.

You can also ask the trustees to transfer your pension rights to a new pension
scheme.

**Funding standards**

The trustees must meet the minimum standards of funding for funded
occupational schemes.

**Providing for dependants**

Pension schemes usually have benefits for you when you retire and for your
widowed spouse and dependent children after your death. Not all schemes have
arrangements for dependants.

The maximum benefit that can be provided for a spouse or dependent is now 100%
of the pension.

Some schemes may allow you to designate the person who should benefit under
the scheme so it is possible, in some cases, to nominate a person other than a
spouse.
