##  Personal pensions

You may prefer not to join an occupational pension scheme, or you may not have
the option to do so (for example, if you are self-employed or your employer
does not offer such a scheme). In these cases, you can save for retirement by
choosing a different type of pension plan. These are normally known as
personal pension plans or private pension plans and are managed by a life
assurance or investment company.

The two main types of personal pension plan are Personal Retirement Savings
Account (PRSA) and Retirement Annuity Contract (RAC).

If your employer offers a PRSA rather than an occupational pension, they must
deduct contributions from your salary and send these payments to the PRSA
provider. The employer may also contribute to the PRSA but does not have to do
so.

You can be a member of an occupational pension scheme and also arrange a
personal pension. However, it may not be possible to claim tax benefits for
both. You cannot contribute to an occupational pension scheme and a personal
pension arrangement at the same time for the same employment. However, you can
make a personal pension arrangement for earnings from another employment or
from self-employment.
