###  Rules on wind-up of defined benefit schemes

When a defined benefit pension scheme is being wound up, its [ assets are
distributed in a specific order of priority
](https://www.pensionsauthority.ie/en/lifecycle/scheme_funding_restructuring/scheme_wind-
ups/) . If the scheme is fully funded then all liabilities are met, which
means you will get the pension you expected from the scheme. If the pension
scheme is underfunded or insolvent, then people with a lower order of priority
do not get what they expected from the scheme.

These rules differ depending on whether or not the employer is solvent.

**Single insolvency order – if the employer is solvent**

This order applies where the defined benefit scheme is insolvent but the
employer is solvent. The first priority to be paid is additional voluntary
contributions and defined contribution benefits.

The second priority is the pensions payable to current pensioners but there
are now limits on the amounts to which priority is attached as follows:

  * The first €12,000 annually of pension 
  * 90% of pensions between €12,000 and €60,000 with a minimum of €12,000 
  * 80% of pensions over €60,000 with a minimum of €54,000 

The next priority is 50% of the pensions of future pensioners. After that, the
priority is:

  * The remaining pension of current pensioners 
  * Remaining pensions of future pensioners 
  * Any other remaining benefits 

This means that existing pensioners could have their current pensions reduced.
Pensions under €12,000 may not be reduced. The maximum reduction is 10% of
pensions under €60,000 (but they cannot be reduced to less than €12,000) and
20% of pensions over €60,000.

**Double insolvency order – if the employer is insolvent**

The priority in the winding up of a defined benefit pension scheme where the
employer is insolvent is as follows:

  1. Additional Voluntary Contributions (AVCs) and defined contribution benefits 
  2. 50% of current pensioner and future pensioner benefits 
  3. Pensioner benefits up to €12,000 a year 
  4. Remaining benefits for current pensioners 
  5. Remaining benefits for future pensioners 

Where the scheme does not have enough funds to pay 50% of pensioner and future
pensioner benefits and pensioner benefits up to €12,000 a year, the Minister
for Finance must provide the necessary funding.
