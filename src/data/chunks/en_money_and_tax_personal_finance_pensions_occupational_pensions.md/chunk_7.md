##  Defined contribution scheme

A defined contribution scheme is where the contribution is fixed by agreement
but the benefits are based on the value of the fund built up from the
contributions. The value of the fund may change over time. This means that you
do not know the amount of pension you will get.

Both you and your employer pay regular contributions, normally a fixed
percentage of your salary. This money creates a pension fund, which is
normally invested to ensure that its real value is not reduced by inflation.

Your pension fund at retirement may be worth less than the total value of your
contributions, because:

  * Investment performance may fall as well as rise 
  * Management fees are paid to the person or company managing the pension fund
