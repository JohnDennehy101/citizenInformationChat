##  Occupational pensions and social welfare pensions

Occupational and personal pensions are independent of the social welfare
pensions (which include the [ contributory ](/en/social-welfare/older-and-
retired-people/state-pension-contributory/) and [ non-contributory
](/en/social-welfare/older-and-retired-people/state-pension-non-contributory/)
State Pension).

However, it is common for occupational pensions to take into account the level
of social welfare pension received in calculating the level of benefit. For
example, some schemes provide for a benefit, which, together with the social
welfare pension, will give you a half or two-thirds of your final salary. This
may be done when you start to receive your pension but your occupational
pension may not be subsequently reduced because your social welfare pension is
increased. These schemes are sometimes called integrated or co-ordinated
schemes.
