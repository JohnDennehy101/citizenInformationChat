##  Your GP

If your child is experiencing mental health difficulties, contact your GP.

You can visit your GP along with your child or young person. The [ HSE has a
list of questions ](https://www2.hse.ie/mental-health/services-
support/questions-to-ask/) you, or your child, might find useful when you are
talking to the GP or other healthcare professional.

Explain what you’re worried about and any changes, however big or small, you
have noticed in the last weeks or months. Your GP is likely to ask lots of
questions. It is important to tell the GP everything you are concerned about
so they can either advise what to do next, or give you a referral for the
right services, if appropriate.

Your GP may want to meet or talk with your young person alone for some time.
That’s normal.

Your GP will identify the right support or service for your child, based on:

  * Their age 
  * The type of symptoms they are experiencing 
  * The severity of their symptoms 
  * Their level of risk
