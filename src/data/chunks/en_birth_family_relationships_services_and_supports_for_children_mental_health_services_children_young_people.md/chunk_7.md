##  Private mental health care services

Mental health professionals in private practice all over Ireland provide
therapy sessions for young people under 18. You should check what experience
they have with working with young people, the type of support they offer, and
the cost per session before making an appointment. You do not need a referral
from your GP, you can just make appointments directly.

Not all therapists are trained in the same way or have the same
qualifications. Spunout has information to help you [ understand the
difference between counsellors and psychotherapists
](https://spunout.ie/mental-health/getting-help/private-counselling-
psychotherapy) and the types of therapy available.
