##  Specialist services

The next level of supports and services are designed for people who are
experiencing moderate to severe mental health issues. The services at this
level are sometimes described as specialist services. They are usually led by
psychiatrists, and most of the people who are accessing supports at this level
will have a clinical mental health diagnosis. To access these supports and
services your child will need a referral from your GP or healthcare
professional.
