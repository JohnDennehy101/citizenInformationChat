###  CAMHS

The main specialist mental health support for young people under the age of 18
is child and adolescent mental health services (CAMHS). CAMHS is designed for
young people with moderate to severe mental health difficulties.

CAMHS prioritises referrals based on risk, which means people who are
considered at highest risk will be seen sooner, and those categorised as lower
risk will wait longer to be seen. CAHMS assesses and treats conditions
including:

  * Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) 
  * Moderate to severe depression 
  * Anxiety 
  * Eating disorders 
  * Self-harm 

CAMHS have 3 levels of referrals:

  1. **Emergency referral** is when there is a significant risk to the young personâ€™s safety, such as suicide attempt, significant self-harm or a severe eating disorder. These referrals will be prioritised and seen quickly. 
  2. **Urgent referral** is where there are high concerns for the young person but it is not a crisis or emergency. 
  3. Referrals are categorised as **routine** when there is no immediate risk. 

Specialist services are also for people who are experiencing severe and
complex mental health issues and need intensive support. This can involve a
stay in a hospital or a similar supported living setting where a team of
mental health professionals can monitor symptoms and give specialist support
and treatments.

[ Inpatient treatment ](https://spunout.ie/mental-health/getting-
help/inpatient-treatment) can be helpful if your child's symptoms are so
severe that they are making it difficult for them to function, if their safety
is at risk, or if they also need some physical health treatment because of
their mental health issues.
