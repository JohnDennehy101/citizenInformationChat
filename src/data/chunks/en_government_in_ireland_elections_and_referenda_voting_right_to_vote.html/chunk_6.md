##  European Union citizens

Citizens of the EU who live in Ireland can vote in:

  * [ European elections ](/en/government-in-ireland/elections-and-referenda/types-of-elections-and-referendums/european-elections/)
  * [ Local elections ](/en/government-in-ireland/elections-and-referenda/types-of-elections-and-referendums/local-elections/)

If you are an EU citizen, other than an Irish citizen, and you were not
registered to vote in previous European elections in Ireland, you must also
complete a declaration on form EP1 (available from your local authority). This
is to guard against double voting in European elections. The local authority
will send the information in your declaration to your country of nationality.

You must be registered at one address only. If you move away from the address
at which you are registered, you will need to contact the local authority and
give them your new address.

If you leave your address but you plan to return there within 18 months, you
can continue to be registered there, as long you do not register at any other
address.

EU citizens are identified by the letter **‘E’** on the Register of Electors.
