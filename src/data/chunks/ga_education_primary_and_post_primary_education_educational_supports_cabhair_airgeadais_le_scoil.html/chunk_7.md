####  **Leabhair saor in aisce don tsraith Shóisearach**

Ó Mheán Fómhair 2024, cuirfidh scoileanna sa Scéim Saoroideachais leabhair
scoile agus croí-acmhainní ranga ar fáil do gach dalta sa tSraith Shóisearach
(iad siúd atá sa chéad 3 bliana den iar-bhunscoil).

Core classroom resources include things like copybooks, journals, calculators
and dictionaries.

The school will provide the free books on loan. You must return the books at
the end of the school year, or if your child leaves the school. If you must
buy additional items for your child, the school will let you know. While the
scheme includes eBooks, it does not cover the purchase of digital devices.

If your child already started in first year of post-primary school, you may
already have their Junior Cycle books. If your child needs additional books
before starting second or third year in September 2024, the school will
provide them for free.
