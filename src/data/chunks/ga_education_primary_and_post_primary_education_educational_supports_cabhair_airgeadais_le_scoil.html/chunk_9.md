##  Táillí scrúdaithe

**Note: There were no exam fees for students sitting the Junior Cycle or
Leaving Certificate exams in 2024.**

Ordinarily, students whose parent or guardian have a [ medical card
](/ga/health/medical-cards-and-gp-visit-cards/medical-card/) do not have to
pay the examination fees for [ Junior Cycle
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/education/state-examinations/junior-
cycle-exam-and-results/#7652a5) or [ Leaving Certificate
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/education/state-
examinations/examination-fees/) . You put the details of the medical card on
the fee payment form and send it back to the school.

Mar sin féin, má dhéanann tú iarratas tar éis an spriocdháta, beidh ort táillí
déanacha a íoc fiú má tá cárta leighis ag do thuismitheoirí.
