###  Legal aid (District Court) certificate

When you are first charged and brought before the [ District Court
](/en/justice/courts-system/district-court/) you can apply for a legal aid
(District Court) certificate. This certificate entitles the [ solicitor
](/en/justice/courtroom/solicitors/) assigned to the case to be paid for all
his or her appearances in the District Court.

If the charge is murder or if the case is of sufficient complexity and
gravity, the legal aid (District Court) certificate will entitle you to both a
solicitor and [ barrister ](/en/justice/courtroom/barristers/) at the District
Court stage.
