##  Dáil privileges

[ The Irish Constitution ](/en/government-in-ireland/irish-
constitution-1/constitution-introduction/) sets out rights and privileges that
apply to TDs and Senators when they are undertaking their work in the
Oireachtas.

TDs may not be arrested when they are going to or returning from the Houses of
the Oireachtas. This does not apply to arrest for treason, felony (a serious
crime that must be tried before a jury) or breach of the peace. This privilege
does **not** mean that TDs are immune from prosecution.

TDs cannot be sued for [ defamation ](/en/justice/civil-law/law-on-
defamation/) based on a speech given in the House. If a member of the public
believes that a TD has defamed them in the Oireachtas, they can make a
submission to the [ Dáil Committee on Parliamentary Privileges and Oversight
](https://www.oireachtas.ie/en/committees/33/privileges-and-oversight-dail/) .
If a TD is found to have abused this privilege, the Committee can discipline
them.
