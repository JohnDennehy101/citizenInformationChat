##  The role of TDs

Your TD is your elected representative in Dáil Éireann.

A TD can be part of a political party or independent. Usually, the party with
the most TDs forms [ the Government ](/en/government-in-ireland/how-
government-works/national-government/government-of-ireland/) . Following a [
general election ](/en/government-in-ireland/elections-and-referenda/types-of-
elections-and-referendums/the-general-election/) , if no party has enough TDs
elected to form a government, a smaller party (or parties) might join with a
larger party to form a _coalition government_ , or there might be an agreement
to support a government even though it does not have a majority of TDs (a
_minority government_ ).

A TD that is part of the government might be chosen as [ a Minister of State
](/en/government-in-ireland/how-government-works/national-
government/departments-of-state/) . If a TD is not part of the government,
they might support the government, or be in opposition.
