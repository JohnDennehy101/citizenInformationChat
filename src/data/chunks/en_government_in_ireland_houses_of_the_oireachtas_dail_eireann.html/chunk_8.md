##  The Ceann Comhairle

When a new Dáil is formed after a general election, the first thing it does is
elect a _Ceann Comhairle_ from the members of the Dáil (TDs).

The Ceann Comhairle is the chairperson of the Dáil, and is responsible for:

  * Keeping order in the Dáil 
  * Calling on members to speak 
  * Making sure that the business of the Dáil follows the rules for procedure in the Dáil ( _the_ _standing orders_ ) 
  * Running the Committee on Procedure, which considers changes to the standing orders 
  * Supervising voting, counting votes and declaring the results 

Even though the Ceann Comhairle is a member of a political party, he or she
must act impartially and must try to ensure that all parties and independent
members are treated fairly.

The Ceann Comhairle is automatically re-elected to the next Dáil, and does not
have to contest a [ general election ](/en/government-in-ireland/elections-
and-referenda/types-of-elections-and-referendums/the-general-election/) .

The Ceann Comhairle has the casting vote when there is a tie of votes in the
Dáil.
