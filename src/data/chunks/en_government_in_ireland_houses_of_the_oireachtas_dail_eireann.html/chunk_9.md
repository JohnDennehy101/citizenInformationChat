##  Parliamentary Questions (PQs)

TDs can ask the Taoiseach and government ministers questions. These are called
_Parliamentary Questions_ or _PQs_ .

The Taoiseach answers questions on Tuesdays on matters relating to his own
department. Other government ministers reply to questions on a rota basis.
This means that they take turns to answer questions, and the rota is repeated
every 5 weeks or so.

A TD cannot ask more than 2 oral questions to a Minister, or 3 to the
Taoiseach, but there is no limit to the number of written questions that can
be sent. Every day 5 oral questions are given priority.

The Minister must be given 3 days’ notice for priority oral questions and 4
days’ notice for other questions. The Ceann Comhairle may accept questions
about an urgent issue at short notice. These are called private notice
questions and are taken at the end of question time.

[ PQs and replies are published
