##  Introduction

Disablement Benefit is a benefit under the [ Occupational Injuries Scheme
](/en/social-welfare/disability-and-illness/occupational-injuries-benefit-
overview/) . It can be paid to you if you suffer a loss of physical or mental
faculty because of an accident at work, an accident travelling directly to or
from work, or a prescribed disease contracted at work. Payment is only made
where the level of disablement following the accident or disease is assessed
at 15% or more.

Where the level of disablement is assessed at 20% or more the benefit is paid
weekly or every 4 weeks (called Disablement Pension). However, where the rate
is assessed at less than 20%, the benefit is paid as a lump sum (called
Disablement Gratuity). The size of the lump sum will vary depending on the
degree of disablement and how long you are reasonably expected to be disabled.

People getting Disablement Pension (without another payment) can work, full or
part-time. If you are getting Disablement Pension and you are unfit for work,
you may qualify for Illness Benefit based on your [ social insurance
contributions ](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/social-
insurance-prsi/social-insurance/) (PRSI). If you do not qualify for [ Illness
Benefit ](/en/social-welfare/disability-and-illness/illness-benefit/) or
another social welfare payment, you may get Incapacity Supplement.
