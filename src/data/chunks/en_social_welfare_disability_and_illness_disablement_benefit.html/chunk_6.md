###  Other social welfare payments

Disablement Benefit is a compensation payment and can be paid at the same time
as most social welfare payments including Jobseeker’s Benefit, Jobseeker’s
Allowance, Disability Allowance, Invalidity Pension, State Pension and One-
Parent Family Payment. It is not considered as means for most social welfare
means-assessed schemes except in the case of Supplementary Welfare Allowance
or Working Family Payment.

Disablement Benefit is disregarded for the means test for Fuel Allowance from
January 2023.
