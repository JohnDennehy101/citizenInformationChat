###  Travelling abroad

Children cannot book a holiday or a flight until they are 18 years of age.
Many carriers will not allow children under 16 years of age to travel
unaccompanied â€“ contact your carrier to check what its policy is.

A child under 18 years of age must have their own passport to travel. If your
child has never had a passport before, or if their last passport was issued
more than 15 years ago, you need to apply on their behalf as a first-time
applicant.

[ Passports for children ](/en/travel-and-recreation/passports/passports-for-
children/) under 18 years of age are valid for 5 years. Parental consent is
required when applying. You can make a [ first-time application online for a

someone under 18 years of age from anywhere in the world using [ Passport
