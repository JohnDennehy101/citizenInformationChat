###  Changing your name

The surname of a child can be changed in the [ Register of Births ](/en/birth-
family-relationships/after-your-baby-is-born/registering-birth-your-baby/) but
only in certain circumstances. However, the surname of a child can also be
changed by deed poll or common usage.

Children aged between 14 and 17 years can execute the Deed Poll themselves but
need the consent of both parents. Where a child is under the age of 14 years,
one of the child's parents must execute the Deed Poll with the consent of the
other parent.

You can [ change your name by deed poll ](/en/birth-family-
relationships/problems-in-marriages-and-other-relationships/changing-your-
name/) without consent when you are aged 18 or over.
