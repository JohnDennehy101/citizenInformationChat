###  Tracing your birth family or relatives

If you are adopted and wish to have contact or share information with your
birth family, you can have your details entered in the [ Contact Preference
Register ](https://www.birthinfo.ie/what-options-do-i-have/register-or-update-
my-contact-preferences) under the Birth Information and Tracing Act 2022.
However, you must be 18 years of age or over. If you are an adopted child
under 18, an adoptive parent may join on your behalf.
