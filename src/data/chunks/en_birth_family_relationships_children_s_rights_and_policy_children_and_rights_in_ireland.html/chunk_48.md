###  Bank accounts

Accounts for children of primary school age are usually simple, easy to use
savings or deposit accounts. You can open them with a very small amount of
money.

Accounts for secondary school students usually offer ATM cards or debit cards,
but you have to keep the account in credit at all times. They do not offer an
overdraft facility and there is a limit to how much you can withdraw. Usually
you do not have to pay transaction fees and charges.

You cannot open a standard current account until you are aged 18.

When opening an account each provider has different procedures. Some providers
require that a parent or guardian sign the account opening form if you are
under 16 years of age. Other providers only require parental permission if you
are under 13 years of age.
