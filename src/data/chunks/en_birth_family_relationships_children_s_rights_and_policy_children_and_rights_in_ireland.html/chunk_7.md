###  Minimum wage

The [ National Minimum Wage Act 2000
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2000/en/act/pub/0005/index.html) provides for
the minimum wage rate. From 1 January 2024, the national minimum wage rate is
€12.70 an hour. Wage rates are based on age, for example, an employee under
age 18 is entitled to €8.89 per hour or 70% of the minimum wage. An employee
aged 18 is entitled to €10.16 or 80% of the minimum wage, and an employee aged
19 is entitled to €11.43 or 90% of the minimum wage.

An employer can pay more and this should be written in your contract of
employment.
