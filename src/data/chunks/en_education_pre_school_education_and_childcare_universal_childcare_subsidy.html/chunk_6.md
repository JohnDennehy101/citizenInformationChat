You can apply by post by contacting the Parent Support Centre (see ‘More
information’ below). If you apply by post, it takes longer to process and may
affect the start date when your subsidy can be paid.

The subsidy is paid directly to your childcare provider and is deducted from
the cost of your childcare.
