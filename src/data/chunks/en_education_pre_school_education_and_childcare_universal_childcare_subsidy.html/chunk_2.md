##  What is the universal subsidy?

The universal subsidy is a childcare subsidy for children over 6 months and
under 15 years who are in Tusla-registered childcare.

The subsidy is paid directly to your childcare provider. The subsidy is then
deducted from the overall bill you get from your childcare provider.
