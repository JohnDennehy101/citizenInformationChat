##  Refusal to issue a Marriage Registration Form

Under the Civil Registration Act 2004 (as amended by [ the Civil Registration
(Amendment) Act 2014
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2014/act/34/enacted/en/html) ), the
Registrar has the right to investigate and decide whether an intended marriage
would be a [ marriage of convenience for immigration purposes
](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/a4a0c2-impediments-to-marriage-in-
ireland/#marriage-of-convenience) . A Registrar who thinks that an intended
marriage would constitute a marriage of convenience will refer the matter to a
Superintendent Registrar.

If, following investigation, the Superintendent Registrar decides that based
on evidence, your proposed marriage constitutes a marriage of convenience then
you will not be issued with a Marriage Registration Form and the Department of
Justice will be advised. You can appeal this refusal to the Circuit Family
Court.
