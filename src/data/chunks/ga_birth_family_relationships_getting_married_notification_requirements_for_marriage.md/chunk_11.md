###  **What do you do with the MRF?**

  * You are given the MRF after you meet with the registrar to give 3 monthsâ€™ notice (assuming you met all the necessary conditions). 
  * Bring the MRF to your marriage ceremony and give it to the registrar solemnising your wedding. 
  * If you have a civil ceremony, the registrar solemnising your wedding will register the marriage on your behalf after the ceremony when the form has been signed. 
  * If you get married by religious or secular ceremony, you must give the MRF to a Registrar at a Civil Registration Service within 1 month for the marriage to be registered. It does not have to be returned to the same Registrar who gave it to you. 

You cannot get your marriage certificate until your marriage is registered.

If the marriage does not take place within 6 months of the date of marriage
given on the MRF, a new MRF will be required if you still intend to marry. You
will need to repeat the notification process.
