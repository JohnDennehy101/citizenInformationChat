##  How to give your notice of your intention to marry

You must give _notification of your intention to marry_ to a Registrar at
least 3 months before the intended date of the marriage.

You will need to:

  * Contact your local Civil Registration Service to get a postal marriage notification form. Once you have completed the form, you can return it by post or by email. 
  * Contact the Civil Registration Service to make a marriage notification appointment with the Registrar. You can also book a marriage notification appointment [ online ](https://www2.hse.ie/services/births-deaths-and-marriages/getting-married/book-appointment/) for certain areas of the country. 

When you make the appointment with the Registrar, you will be told what
information and documents to bring with you (see ' [ Documentation you will
need ](notification_requirements_for_marriage.en.htmll#l208b6) ' below.)

The Registrar does not have to be the Registrar for the district where you
live or where you intend getting married. If you plan to get married by civil
ceremony and a different Registrar will be solemnising the marriage, you must
also contact the Registrar's Office for the district you intend getting
married in.

The requirement to give 3 monthsâ€™ notice does not apply to civil partners
whose civil partnership was registered in Ireland (see 'Civil partners'
below).
