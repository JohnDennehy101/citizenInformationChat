##  How to find a disabled parking space

Some [ local authorities ](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/942f74-local-
authorities/) have lists of disabled parking spaces available on their
websites. You can also telephone ahead of your destination.

Private car parks generally have parking spaces available for people with
disabilities. Private car parks include parking facilities at shopping
centres, supermarkets, universities, hotels, and hospitals. You should check
with private car parks if they recognise your valid parking permit and whether
payment is needed. If there are time limits imposed in these car parks, they
may not apply to people with disabilities. The conditions of parking should be
clearly stated on signs.

Disabled parking bays are:

  * Clearly marked for use by people with disabilities by both signs and road markings. (Road markings normally consist of the "accessibility" symbol). 
  * Slightly wider than an average parking space to allow for easy access.
