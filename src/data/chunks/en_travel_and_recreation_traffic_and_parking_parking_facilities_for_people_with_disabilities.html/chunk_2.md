##  Introduction

Parking spaces for people with disabilities are located in towns and cities
throughout Ireland. To use these spaces, you must have a [ disabled persons
parking card ](/en/travel-and-recreation/traffic-and-parking/disabled-persons-
parking-card/) (valid parking permit). You can park in a designated on-street
parking bay free of charge for an unlimited time, unless otherwise stated.

Generally, all street parking spaces or local authority car parks provide
parking free of charge to the permit holder. However, there may be time
restrictions in place in certain locations, so always check the signs.

Private car parks may have different rules.
