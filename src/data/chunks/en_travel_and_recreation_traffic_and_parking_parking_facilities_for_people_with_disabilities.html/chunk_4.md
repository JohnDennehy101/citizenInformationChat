##  Valid parking permit

You must have a valid [ disabled persons parking card ](/en/travel-and-
recreation/traffic-and-parking/disabled-persons-parking-card/) displayed on
your windshield to use a disabled parking bay. The card will show the
signature and photograph of the holder.

The parking permit scheme is administered by the [ Disabled Drivers
Association ](http://www.ddai.ie/) and the [ Irish Wheelchair Association
](http://www.iwa.ie/) .

Having a valid disabled persons parking card does not guarantee you a parking
space if none is available.
