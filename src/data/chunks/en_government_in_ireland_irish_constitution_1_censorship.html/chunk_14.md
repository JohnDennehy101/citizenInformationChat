###  ISPs and online platforms regulate themselves

Internet service providers (ISPs) operating in Ireland (such as Eir, Vodafone,
and Virgin Media) have a system of self-regulation. It has been agreed and
overseen by the Department of Justice and Equality since 1998. The Internet
Service Providersâ€™ Association of Ireland (ISPAI) is the representative body
for ISPs.

The ISPAI also runs the anonymous reporting service: [ Hotline.ie
](https://www.hotline.ie/) . Members must have the ISPAI and Hotline.ie logos
on their websites to show their commitment to responsible internet business
practices and online child protection.

Online platforms (such as Facebook and Twitter) often have their own policies
and community standards to regulate and prevent illegal content such as hate
speech, promotion of terrorism, bullying and harassment, and violent or
graphic content. Platform users who do not follow community standards risk
being penalised (for example, your account could be closed).
