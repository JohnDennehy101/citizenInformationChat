###  How are films certified?

A film can be certified as unfit for viewing because IFCO decides that:

  * It is likely to cause harm to children 
  * It is indecent, obscene or blasphemous 
  * Viewing it might go against public morality 

In addition to banning a film, IFCO may decide that sections of a film must be
removed before it can be certified as suitable for viewing.

IFCO provides guidelines on an appropriate age group for films – and certifies
films from G (general) to 18 (adult). A copy of the IFCO certificate must be
shown for at least 10 seconds immediately before a film is shown. IFCO also
views and approves advertising shown in a cinema to promote a film, to ensure
it is appropriate for the certificate.
