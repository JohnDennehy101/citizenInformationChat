##  Censorship of the internet

Currently, Ireland has no specific laws covering internet censorship. Online
and social media companies are not subject to regulation by the State for
content that is shared on their platforms.

However, there are some legal restrictions that must be followed. These
include:

  * The EU Directive 2000/31 on electronic commerce requires internet service providers (ISPs) and online platforms to act fast and efficiently once they become aware of illegal content. [ S.I. No. 68/2003 ](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2003/si/68/made/en/print) gives effect to the Directive in Ireland. 
  * ISPs are required to remove content that is illegal under the [ Child Trafficking and Pornography Act 1998 ](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1998/act/22/enacted/en/html) . The Act also requires website owners to ensure that contributors (for example, to blogs or chat rooms) agree to terms and conditions before being allowed to post comments or material. 
  * The [ European Union (Copyright and Related Rights Regulations) ](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2012/si/59/made/en/print?q=copyright) became law in 2012. It aims to tackle illegal downloading of copyrighted material, such as films from file-sharing websites. 
  * The EU Directive 2019/790 (specifically [ Article 17 of the Directive ](https://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/dae/redirection/document/76681) ) gives legal protection to the copyright holders of digital content (for example, creators of online videos, music and articles). [ S.I. No. 567/2021 ](https://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2021/si/567/made/en/pdf) gives effect to the Directive in Ireland.
