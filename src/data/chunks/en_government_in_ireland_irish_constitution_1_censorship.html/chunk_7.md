After the 2018 repeal of the Eighth Amendment, which provides for the legal
termination of pregnancy, references to abortion were removed from the
Censorship of Publications Act 1946. In 2019, the Department of Justice
confirmed that several publications providing information about abortion were
to be removed from the Register of Prohibited Publications.

Under the [ Child Trafficking and Pornography Act 1998
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1998/act/22/enacted/en/html) , it is an
offence to possess, print, publish or show child pornography. However, if the
Censorship Board examines a publication and does not ban it, then the
publication is not viewed as unlawful under the child-protection pornography
legislation.
