###  How are online films and games certified?

Currently, there is no legislation on certifying online films and games. The
classification of content on online streaming services (such as Netflix and
Amazon Prime) is not IFCO’s responsibility. However, some on-demand services
carry IFCO’s age classifications voluntarily.
