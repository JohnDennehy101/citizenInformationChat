###  How are DVDs certified?

A DVD (or video) can be banned if IFCO decides that viewing it would:

  * Be likely to cause people to commit crimes 
  * Be likely to stir up hatred against a specific group of people in the State or elsewhere 
  * Tend to deprave or corrupt, because it is obscene or indecent 

It can also ban a DVD (or video) if it shows acts of gross violence or cruelty
(including mutilation and torture) towards humans or animals. IFCO does not
have to give a DVD or video the same classification as the feature film.
IFCOâ€™s website has more information about [ video and DVD classification
guidelines ](http://www.ifco.ie/en/ifco/pages/guidelines) .
