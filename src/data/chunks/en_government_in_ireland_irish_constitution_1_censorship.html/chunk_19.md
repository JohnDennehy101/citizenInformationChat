###  How to complain about a film, DVD or video

You can make a complaint to the Gardaí about offences under the Censorship of
Films Act and the Video Recording Act. These include allowing entry to a film
to someone under the classified age and the importation, possession or supply
of banned or wrongly certified films, DVDs or videos.

Alternatively, you can make a complaint about film and DVD classifications
directly to IFCO.

If you are not satisfied with IFCO’s handling of your complaint, you can then
contact the relevant Ombudsman. For complaints regarding children, contact the
Office of the [ Ombudsman for Children ](/en/birth-family-
relationships/children-s-rights-and-policy/the-ombudsman-for-children/) . For
all other complaints, contact the [ Office of the Ombudsman ](/en/government-
in-ireland/how-government-works/standards-and-accountability/office-of-the-
ombudsman/) .
