The Department of Foreign Affairs recommends that you make a note of the
contact details of the [ nearest Irish embassy or consulate
](https://www.ireland.ie/en/dfa/embassies/) while you are abroad in case you
need to contact them urgently. You are also advised to leave your own contact
details with someone at home who can pass them to the [ Consular Section of
the Department of Foreign Affairs ](https://www.ireland.ie/en/dfa/overseas-
travel/consular-services/) in the event of an emergency.

You can also [ register your contact details with the Department of Foreign
Affairs ](https://www.ireland.ie/en/dfa/overseas-travel/citizens-
registration/) . Irish citizens travelling or living overseas are encouraged
to register their contact details with the Department of Foreign Affairs.
Registration is voluntary, but it will allow the Department to provide
assistance, if necessary and possible.
