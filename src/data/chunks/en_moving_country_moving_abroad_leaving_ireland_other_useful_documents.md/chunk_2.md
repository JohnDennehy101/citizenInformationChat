##  Introduction

If you are leaving Ireland, you may be travelling for reasons of work, study,
holiday or retirement abroad. Whatever it is you intend to do, you will need
to take with you certain documentation (for example, proof of your
citizenship, identity, address in Ireland). It is always easier to get hold of
these documents while you are still in Ireland than retrospectively to seek
these items when you move abroad.

The Department of Foreign Affairs has developed a [ free smartphone app called
TravelWise ](https://www.dfa.ie/travelwise/) which has travel advice and
consular information on 200 countries. The app is available from the Apple and
Android stores.
