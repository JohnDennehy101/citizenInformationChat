##  What is the Communication Support Grant?

If you are deaf, hard of hearing, have a speech impairment or another
disability that requires communication support, you can apply for funding to
pay for an interpreter under the Communication Support Grant.

The funding covers communication assistance during job interviews, job
inductions, in-work meetings, or performance reviews.

The Communication Support grant is only available to assist with jobs in the
private sector. If you have a public sector job or interview, it is up to the
organisation to interview or employ you to provide an interpreter.
