###  Online applications

You can apply for Paternity Benefit online at [ MyWelfare.ie.
](https://services.mywelfare.ie/en/topics/parents-children-family/paternity-
benefit/)

You fill in the questions asked in the online form and upload the supporting
documentation, which is either a completed [ form PB2
](https://assets.gov.ie/10312/a293b948613c41edaeb84ae4396725e3.pdf) or [ form
PB3 ](https://assets.gov.ie/10313/4a7cef3662634402bfd5f44cc071941e.pdf) .

The PB2 form must be completed by your employer to certify that you are
entitled to paternity leave. If you are not working or you are self-employed,
you get the PB3 form completed by a doctor. The doctor must certify the due
date of your baby (or the babyâ€™s actual date of birth). This is required to
confirm that you are entitled to paternity leave.

You must have a [ Public Services Card ](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-
welfare-system/public-services-card/) (linked to your mobile phone number) and
a verified [ MyGovID ](https://www.mygovid.ie/en-IE/GettingStarted) account to
apply online.
