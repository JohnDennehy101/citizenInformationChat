###  Postal applications

Application forms are available by post at the address below - see ‘Where to
apply for Paternity Benefit.

Fill in the form and send it to the Paternity Benefit Section of the
Department of Social Protection. The form includes a PB2 section which must be
completed by your employer to certify that you are entitled to paternity
leave.

If you’re not working or you are self-employed, you must get the PB3 section
of the form completed by a doctor. The doctor must certify the due date of
your baby (or the baby’s actual date of birth). This is required to confirm
that you are entitled to paternity leave.
