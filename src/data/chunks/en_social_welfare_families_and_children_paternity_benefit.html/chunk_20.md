###  Premature births

If your baby is born prematurely (before your Paternity Leave and Paternity
Benefit is due to begin) and you wish to change your leave dates, you should
send a letter from your employer confirming the new leave dates and the date
of birth of your child to the Paternity Benefit section of the Department of
Social Protection. If you are self-employed you must send a letter to the
Paternity Benefit section stating your new leave dates and a letter from a
doctor or the hospital confirming the date of birth of your child.
