###  Stillbirths and miscarriages

If there is a stillbirth or miscarriage any time after the 24th week of
pregnancy (i.e. from the beginning of the 25th week) and you are entitled to
paternity leave, you are entitled to 2 weeks Paternity Benefit provided you
satisfy the social insurance (PRSI) requirements.

To apply for Paternity Benefit following a stillbirth, you need to send a
letter from your doctor with the Paternity Benefit application form,
confirming the expected date of birth, the actual date of birth and the number
of weeks of pregnancy.

The leave must still be certified by your employer or self-certified if you
are self-employed.
