###  Hospitalisation of baby

If your baby is in hospital you can postpone your paternity leave and
Paternity Benefit or whatever portion of it remains for a maximum of 6 months.
If you are an employee and you wish to change your leave dates because of the
hospitalisation of your baby, you should send a letter from your employer
confirming the new leave dates to the Paternity Benefit section of the
Department of Social Protection. If you are self-employed and you wish to
change your leave dates because of the hospitalisation of your baby, you must
send a letter to the Paternity Benefit section stating your new leave dates
and a letter from a doctor or the hospital confirming the date of birth of
your child.
