##  Work experience

Work experience is a core part of Transition Year. It aims to bring new kinds
of learning opportunities to students by experiencing working life. It also
helps students get some work experience for their CV, which is useful when
looking for jobs in the future.

You do not have to find work experience in an area you want to work in later
in life, but it is more enjoyable to try to get work experience in something
that interests you.
