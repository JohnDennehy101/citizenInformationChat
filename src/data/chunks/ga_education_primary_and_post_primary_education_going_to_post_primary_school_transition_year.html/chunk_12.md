##  Transition Year assessment and certification

There is no end-of-year state examination in Transition Year. This is to allow
students to learn, mature and develop without the pressure of an upcoming
exam.

Schools use school-based assessment, which helps students learn about their
own strengths and weaknesses, and develop skills of self-assessment and
reflection.

School-based assessment is ongoing, and can include:

  * Portfolio making 
  * Project work 
  * Exhibitions of studentsâ€™ work 
  * Oral, written and practical activities 
  * Evaluation of work experience or community service activities by the employer or hosts 

Students who have successfully completed the Transition Year programme are
usually awarded a certificate of participation by their school.
