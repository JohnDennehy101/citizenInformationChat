####  **Writing a cover letter and a CV**

You should write a cover letter and put together a Curriculum Vitae (CV) that
you can give to potential employers as part of applying for work experience
(and for [ applying for jobs in the future
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/employment/starting-work-and-changing-
job/training-and-looking-for-work/finding-and-getting-a-job/) in general).

Your cover letter should include:

  * Your name and your contact details 
  * Your school and what year you are in 
  * Why you are writing to the employer (to ask about work experience opportunities) 
  * Why you want to work in the place you’re applying to 
  * The dates and times you are available for work experience (can you do full days or mornings or afternoons only, for example) 
  * A copy of your CV 

If you are writing to many places, you should tailor your cover letter to suit
the place you are writing to.

A CV typically includes your:

  * Contact details 
  * Qualifications and training 
  * Work experience to date 
  * Key skills 
  * Personal interests and achievements 
  * References[ 

As a Transition Year student, you might not have any work experience or
references to include, so you don’t need to worry about that.

You can just include the other information, along with your Junior Cycle
results (which might be helpful if you’re applying for a job which involves a
subject you did well in). Read more about [ making a CV on Spuntout.ie
