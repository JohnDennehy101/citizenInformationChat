###  Right of way

There is a distinction in Irish law between public and private [ rights of way
](/en/housing/owning-a-home/home-owners/right-of-way/) . A public right of way
is a person's right of passage along a road or path, even if the road or path
is not in public ownership. There are very few registered public rights of way
that are not maintained on public roads.

A private right of way is the right to enter onto private lands, but only for
the purposes of gaining access to or exiting from another piece of land. It is
typically an arrangement between neighbours.

The waymarked trails are _permissive routes_ that have been developed with the
landownersâ€™ agreement and are not rights of way.
