##  Introduction

Walking and rambling trails have become very popular in recent times. There
are 3 main walking schemes for walking route developments:

  * The National Waymarked Trails Programme in Sport Ireland 
  * The Slí na Sláinte Scheme under the Irish Heart Foundation 
  * Coillte recreational forests. 

Make sure to prepare and plan your trip before you head out. You can get
guidance from [ Sports Ireland ](https://www.sportireland.ie/outdoors/trail-
advice-guidance) .

There are certain restrictions that apply to those walking or rambling – See
more in the ‘laws and restrictions’ below.
