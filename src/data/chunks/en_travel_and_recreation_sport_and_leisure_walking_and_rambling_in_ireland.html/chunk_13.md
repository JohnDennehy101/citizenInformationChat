###  Respecting private landowners' property

You should protect the environment when out walking. You should avoid causing
any disturbances to farm land. You can find more information on [
leavenotraceireland.org ](http://www.leavenotraceireland.org/) .

Under the [ Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1994/en/act/pub/0002/index.html) as amended
by [ Section 24 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2002
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2002/en/act/pub/0009/sec0024.html#partiii-
sec24) , it is a criminal offence for anyone to enter, occupy or bring
anything onto privately-owned land or land owned by local authorities if that
act is likely to:

  * Substantially damage the land. 
  * Substantially damage any amenity on the land or prevent any person from making reasonable use of that amenity. 
  * Render the land or any amenity on it unsanitary or unsafe. 
  * Substantially interfere with the land or an amenity on it. 

If a landowner believes that someone is illegally occupying their land to the
extent of committing one of the above offences, they should tell the [ Garda
Síochána ](http://www.garda.ie/Stations/Default.aspx) .
