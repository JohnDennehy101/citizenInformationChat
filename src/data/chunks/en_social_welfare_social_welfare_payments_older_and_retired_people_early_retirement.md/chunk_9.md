###  Safeguarding your entitlements

If you retire early and do nothing, you will have a number of years during
which you have no PRSI contributions. This will mean that you may have
difficulty in qualifying for the [ State Pension (Contributory) ](/en/social-
welfare/older-and-retired-people/state-pension-contributory/) .

If you are not employed or self-employed, you do not have to pay PRSI
contributions. You can keep your PRSI contribution record up to date either by
[ getting credits ](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/social-
insurance-prsi/credited-social-insurance-contributions/) or paying voluntary
PRSI contributions.
