###  If you are unemployed

Whether you consider yourself to be retired or unemployed, you may be eligible
for Jobseeker's Benefit (JB) if you are aged under 66. You may then be
eligible for Jobseeker's Allowance (JA).

If you are claiming JA or JB and you are 62 or over you are not required to
engage with the [ activation process ](/en/social-welfare/unemployed-
people/employment-supports/) and you will not be subject to [ penalty rates
for non-engagement ](/en/social-welfare/unemployed-people/rules-for-getting-a-
jobseekers-payment/) . Note that to qualify for either Jobseekerâ€™s Benefit or
Allowance you must be genuinely seeking work and be available for full-time
employment and these conditions will continue to apply to older jobseekers.
You can voluntarily avail of a range of supports (for example, training or
employment support programmes) from the Department of Social Protection. Read
more in [ our document on older jobseekers ](/en/social-welfare/unemployed-
people/older-jobseekers/) .
