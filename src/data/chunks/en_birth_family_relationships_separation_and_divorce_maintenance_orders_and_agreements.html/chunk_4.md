###  Voluntary maintenance agreement

When parents or spouses/civil partners separate, it may be possible for you
both to make an informal maintenance agreement. This can work well where both
parties are reasonable and fair.

Informal agreements such as this can include a property transfer or a lump sum
payment but it cannot rule out the possibility of applying for a maintenance
order through the courts in the future.

You may amend any of these arrangements if your personal or financial
circumstances change.
