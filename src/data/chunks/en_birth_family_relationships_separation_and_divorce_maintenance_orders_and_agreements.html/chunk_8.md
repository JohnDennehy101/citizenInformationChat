##  I have been served with a maintenance summons

If you have been served with a maintenance summons, it means that another
person is applying to the court for a maintenance order. The summons is a
command to attend court. You should read the summons and any included
documents very carefully. It will tell you the date, time, and place of the
court hearing. It will also tell you if you need to complete any documentation
before the court date.

If the applicant fails to attend court, the case may be struck out by the
judge. This means that the case will not go ahead and the applicant will have
to start the entire process again.

If you do not attend court, the judge may make an order in your absence. The
applicant may also ask the judge to issue a warrant to have you arrested and
brought to court. If the judge makes this order, the court office will send a
warrant to the Gardaí. When the Gardaí bring you before the court, the judge
will set a new date to deal with the case. The court office will notify the
applicant of this new date.
