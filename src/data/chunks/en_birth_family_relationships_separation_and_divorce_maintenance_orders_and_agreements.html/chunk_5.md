###  Voluntary maintenance agreement using mediation or legal help

If you find it difficult to come to an arrangement which satisfies both
parties, you may find that [ family mediation can help ](/en/birth-family-
relationships/separation-and-divorce/family-mediation-separating-couples/) .

Alternatively, if you cannot agree, both of you can get your own legal advice
who will help you to negotiate a written agreement. Both of you can then sign
this agreement.

Any agreement reached can later be made a rule of court, if the court finds
the terms of the agreement are fair. A rule of court means that these
agreements have the same effect as a maintenance order (see below). Your
solicitor cannot act for both you and your partner in this situation, given
that there may be conflicts of interest.
