##  What are the laws governing international child abduction?

The matter of arranging for the return of a child who has been abducted
internationally is governed by international law. The Hague Convention and EU
Regulation are the main legal frameworks for dealing with international child
abduction cases, and they set out the rules that apply. The EU Regulation
complements the Hague Convention within the EU and applies to an abduction
from one EU member state to another.

International conventions apply to cases in which the EU Regulation does not
apply. More than 100 countries are parties to the Hague Convention on the
Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction.

The legislation is based on similar principles that:

  * The child should be returned to their habitual residence (where they normally live) as soon as possible 
  * The courts of the jurisdiction in which the child is habitually resident (normally lives) are the appropriate courts to decide what is in the best interests of the child 

If your child has been abducted within Ireland, the Hague Convention does not
apply as it only deals with cases of inter-country abduction.

**The Central Authority**

The Central Authority in each country facilitates the return of abducted
children to the country of their habitual residence (the country where they
normally live). The [ Central Authority for Child Abduction at the Department
of Justice ](https://www.gov.ie/en/service/36ac8-child-
abduction/#:~:text=The%20Central%20Authority%20for%20Child,cases%20under%20the%20Hague%20Convention.)
is the national authority in Ireland for dealing with cases under the Hague
Convention.
