##  How can a child be lawfully relocated to another country if the other
parent does not agree, even when it's necessary?

For a child to be lawfully relocated to another country without the consent of
the other parent, an application may be made to the court to allow the lawful
removal of the child.

The same rules apply to temporary removal, for example, a holiday, as
permanent removal.
