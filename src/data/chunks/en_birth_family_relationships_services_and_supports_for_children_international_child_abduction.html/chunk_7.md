##  What should I do if my child is internationally abducted?

If your child has been internationally abducted, you should contact the [
Central Authority in the Department of Justice
](http://www.justice.ie/en/JELR/Pages/WP15000137) immediately in order to set
in motion the procedures required in the country to which the child has been
abducted.

All child abduction cases are treated as a matter of urgency.

The Central Authority assists left behind parents by:

  * Collecting documentation and sending the application form to the foreign Central Authority 
  * Arranging translations of all documentation, as necessary 
  * Monitoring the progress of the application 
  * Providing further documentation to the competent authority in the foreign state, as necessary 
  * Providing regular updates to the left behind parent 
  * Assisting, where appropriate, with an application for legal aid 

The Central Authority for International Child Abduction in Ireland does not
charge for its services.

If your child has been abducted from Ireland and brought to a country that is
not signed up to the Hague Convention, you should contact a solicitor in
Ireland for advice on what legal proceedings may be necessary in the Irish
courts.
