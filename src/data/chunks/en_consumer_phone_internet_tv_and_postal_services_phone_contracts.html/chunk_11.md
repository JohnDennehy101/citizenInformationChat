###  If you signed up over the phone or online

You can cancel the contract if you signed up less than 14 days ago over the
phone or online. This is called a [ ‘cooling-off’ period
](/en/consumer/shopping/shopping-online/) . If you have already used the
service (for example, you made calls on a phone), you are likely to be charged
for what you have used. If you are waiting for a good such as a mobile phone
to be delivered, the cooling off period starts the day you receive it. This is
to allow you time to check if the phone is what you paid for.

If you cancel outside of the cooling off period, you may be charged a penalty
fee or have to pay off the rest of your contract. Check the terms and
conditions of your contract.
