##  Switching providers

Before switching providers, you should check your previous bills to review how
many minutes and texts you use and how much data you will need.

When comparing providers and plans, you should think about:

  * Discount schemes 
  * Minimum contract period 
  * Penalties for ending the contract early 
  * Charges and fees (can include connection charges, monthly rental fees, call costs, disconnection and reconnection charges) 
  * Price options 
  * Number portability 

For mobile contracts, also think about:

  * Network coverage 
  * Roaming for travel abroad 

ComReg's [ price comparison tool ](https://www.comreg.ie/compare/#/services)
allows you to compare mobile phone charges across all operators. It helps you
to select the optimum mobile phone package, based on your individual usage.

Before you switch, you should contact your existing provider to check if any
cancellation period or penalties apply. You will probably need your Universal
Account Number (UAN) to switch. This is usually displayed on your bill, but if
you canâ€™t find it you should ask your existing provider.
