###  Changes to NGNs from 31 December 2021

From 31 December 2021, the number of NGNs reduced from 5 to 2. Now, the only
NGNs are:

  * 1800 
  * 0818 

Organisations that previously used 1850, 1890, and 076 numbers have now
changed to either 1800, 0818, or _geographic numbers_ (geographic numbers are
local numbers with an area code, for example 01).

**Why did this change?**

Many people avoided calling 1850, 1890 and 076 numbers because they thought
they were confusing and expensive. ComReg reduced the number of NGNs to
simplify NGNs for consumers.

Since 31 December 2021, there are just 2 NGNs – 1800 (Freephone) and 0818
(Standard rate). This makes call costs easier to understand.

**What happens if I call an expired NGN?**

Since **31 December 2021** , expired NGNs (including 1850, 1890 and 076
numbers) have been withdrawn from service and you cannot use them.

You may hear an audio message telling you the organisation’s new phone number.
If not, you can check their website for contact details.

**Will calls to NGNs be more expensive from 31 December 2021?**

Calls to 1800 numbers are still free from 31 December 2021.

Calls to 0818 numbers still cost the same as calls to landline numbers.
