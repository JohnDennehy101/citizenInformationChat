##  I am having problems with my phone

**Complaint about the service**

If you have a problem with the service (for example, there are network
coverage issues or you wish to dispute a charge on your bill) or the contract,
you should first contact your service provider to try sort out the issue.

The consumer information section of comreg.ie has advice on the following
topics:

  * **Billing and disputed charges** \- [ home phone ](https://www.comreg.ie/consumer-information/home-phone/billing-and-disputed-charges/) and [ mobile phone ](https://www.comreg.ie/consumer-information/mobile-phone/billing-and-disputed-charges/)
  * **Switching providers** \- [ home phone ](https://www.comreg.ie/consumer-information/home-phone/switching-providers/) and [ mobile phone ](https://www.comreg.ie/consumer-information/mobile-phone/switching-providers/)
  * **Service issues** \- home phone and [ mobile phone ](https://www.comreg.ie/consumer-information/mobile-phone/service-issues/)

If you cannot sort out the problem informally, you can put your complaint in
writing to the phone service provider.

If you are not satisfied with the response from the provider, you can then
contact ComReg for more advice and help.

You can talk to a member of ComReg’s customer care team about your query by:

  * **Text** – send a text with the word COMREG to 51500 (standard SMS rates apply) to receive a call back from the customer care team 
  * **Live web chat**
  * **Online form**
  * **Phone** on 01 8049668 
  * **Irish sign language** through the Consumer Line at [ consumerline@comreg.ie ](mailto:consumerline@comreg.ie) or SLIS at [ bookings@slis.ie ](mailto:bookings@slis.ie) and an appointment will be arranged 

ComReg cannot act on your complaint until you have raised it with your service
provider and their complaint handling process is completed.
