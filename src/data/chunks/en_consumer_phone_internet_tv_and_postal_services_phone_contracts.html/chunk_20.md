###  Non-geographic numbers (NGNs)

From 1 December 2019, calls to 1850, 1890, 0818, or 076 NGNs cost no more than
calling a landline number and are included in your bundle of calls, if your
bundle includes landline calls.

Calls to 1800 numbers from both landline and mobile are free. From 1 January
2022, the number of NGNs will be reduced to just 2 (1800 and 0818).
