##  Getting references

When applying for a new job, you may want to ask your current or former
employer for a _reference_ . The person who gives you a reference is called a
_referee_ .

The reference can be written or spoken and usually includes information about:

  * How long you worked for the employer 
  * Your job responsibilities 
  * Your attendance record 
  * Your job performance 
  * Your suitability for the new job
