##  I have outstanding annual leave

If you leave your job without taking all the [ annual leave
](/en/employment/employment-rights-and-conditions/leave-and-holidays/annual-
leave/) you are entitled to, your employer must pay you for the unused days.

Some employers may offer leave instead (or ‘in lieu’) of notice. These
arrangements are not covered by legislation, so you must agree this with your
employer.
