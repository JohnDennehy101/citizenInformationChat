##  Notice periods

A notice period is the amount of time you must inform your employer before
leaving your job (for example, 2 weeks or a month). It allows both you and
your employer to prepare for the transition.

The length of notice you must give is set down in law and is usually stated in
your [ employment contract ](/en/employment/employment-rights-and-
conditions/contracts-of-employment/contract-of-employment/) .

The laws governing notice periods are detailed in the [ Minimum Notice and
Terms of Employment Acts 1973â€“2005
](https://www.lawreform.ie/_fileupload/RevisedActs/WithAnnotations/HTML/EN_ACT_1973_0004.htm)
