##  Introduction

If you are a member of an approved pension scheme, you can get income tax
relief on your contributions to the scheme.

You pay tax on the pension when it is paid to you. For more information on the
way pension income is taxed see our page on [ taxation of pensions
](/en/money-and-tax/personal-finance/pensions/taxation-of-pensions/) .

The rate of tax relief on your pension contributions is at the highest rate of
income tax you pay, known as the marginal rate.

There are various rules that pension schemes must meet to get the tax relief
and there is a limit to the amount of the relief.

There is no relief on [ PRSI ](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-
system/social-insurance-prsi/social-insurance/) or the [ Universal Social
Charge ](/en/money-and-tax/tax/income-tax/universal-social-charge/) for
employee pension contributions.
