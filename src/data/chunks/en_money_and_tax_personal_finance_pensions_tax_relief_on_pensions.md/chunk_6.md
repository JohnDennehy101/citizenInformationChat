##  Tax relief on lump sums at retirement

When you retire, you can usually take part of your pension fund as a tax-free
lump sum. The amount you can take depends on the type of pension plan you have
and how much you have taken in tax-free lump sums from other pension plans.

There is a limit of €200,000 on the total amount of tax-free retirement lump
sums you can get. Lump sum payments are taxed as follows:

**Taxation of retirement lump sum** **Amount of lump sum** |  **Income tax rate**  
---|---  
Up to €200,000  |  0%   
€200,000–€500,000  |  20%   
Over €500,000  |  [ Marginal rate ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/money-and-tax/tax/income-tax/how-your-tax-is-calculated/#d43041)  
  
There may be a [ limit to how much you can take out of your pension, depending
