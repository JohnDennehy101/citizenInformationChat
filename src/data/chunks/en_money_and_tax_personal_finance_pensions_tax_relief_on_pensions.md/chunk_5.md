####  Annual limit

The annual limit is a percentage of your income. The percentage depends on
your age.

**Tax relief limit as percentage of income** **Age** |  **Limit**  
---|---  
Under 30  |  15%   
30–39  |  20%   
40–49  |  25%   
50–54  |  30%   
55–59  |  35%   
60 or over  |  40%   
  
€115,000 is the maximum income that can be used to calculate the percentage.

For employees, income means gross pay (pay before deductions). If you are
self-employed, income means earnings less allowable expenses, also known as
_net relevant earnings_ .

If you are a professional sportsperson or in a profession that usually retires
at an earlier age than the norm, you can get tax relief on 30% of your net
relevant earnings regardless of your age.

If you have more than one source of income, the relief is only on the source
of income that contributions are made from.

**Limit on total value of fund**

There is a limit on the overall value of your pension fund that you can get
tax relief on. This is called the _Standard Fund Threshold_ . The Standard
Fund Threshold is €2 million. (A higher limit may apply if the fund was over
€2 million on 1 January 2014, this is called a [ Personal Fund Threshold (pdf)
](https://www.revenue.ie/en/tax-professionals/tdm/pensions/chapter-25.pdf) ).

If the fund is greater than the limit, tax at 40% will be charged on the
excess when you become entitled to receive it.
