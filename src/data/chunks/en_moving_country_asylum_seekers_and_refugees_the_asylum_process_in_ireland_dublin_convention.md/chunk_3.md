##  Examination of your application under the Dublin Regulation

When you apply for international protection, the International Protection
Office (IPO) takes your photograph and your fingerprints. The IPO checks this
information against data held by [ Eurodac ](/en/moving-country/asylum-
seekers-and-refugees/the-asylum-process-in-ireland/eurodac-system/) . Eurodac
is an EU database that stores the fingerprints of international protection
applicants, or people who have crossed a border illegally.
