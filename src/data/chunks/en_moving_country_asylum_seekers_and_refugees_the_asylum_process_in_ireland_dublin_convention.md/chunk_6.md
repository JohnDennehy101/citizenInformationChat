###  Other family members

If you have other family members that depend on you (or you depend on them) in
another Dublin country, that country could accept the responsibility of
assessing your international protection application. This applies to your
mother, father, child, brother or sister. Your family members must be living
there legally, depend on you (or you depend on them), and either you or them
are:

  * Pregnant or have a newborn baby or 
  * Seriously ill, disabled or elderly
