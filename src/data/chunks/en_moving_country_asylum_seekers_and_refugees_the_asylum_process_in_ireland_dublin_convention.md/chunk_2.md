##  Introduction

The EU Dublin Regulation is an EU law on the rules about which country should
assess your application for international protection. It applies to _Dublin
countries_ , which include all the countries in the EU, plus Iceland,
Switzerland, Norway and Liechtenstein.

The Dublin Regulation is also called Dublin III because it was the third
version of an agreement that was originally signed in 1990.

When you [ apply for international protection ](/en/moving-country/asylum-
seekers-and-refugees/the-asylum-process-in-ireland/applying-for-refugee-
status-in-ireland/) , you are asked about your history as part of your
application. If you have applied for international protection in another
Dublin country, or if the International Protection Office (IPO) decides that
another country should be responsible for your international protection
application, you could be transferred to that country.
