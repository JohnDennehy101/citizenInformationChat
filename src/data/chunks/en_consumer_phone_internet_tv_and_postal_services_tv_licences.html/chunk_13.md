###  How long is the licence valid?

Your new licence is valid from the date the old licence expires. This applies
even if you paid for it later than the expiry date. For example, your licence
expires on 31 January 2022 but you are late renewing and only pay for it on 1
March 2022. The new licence is valid from 1 February 2022 to 31 January 2023.
