###  Moving to Ireland from another country

If you have moved to Ireland, you canâ€™t transfer a TV licence from overseas.
You must buy a new licence here. This is the case even if you are living in
Ireland for a short time.

Each TV licence is only valid in Ireland and lasts for 1 year. If you leave
the country before it expires, you cannot get a refund on the fee paid.
