###  Fish farms

Fish populations in inland waterways can be negatively affected by water
pollution, fish kills and other problems. The IFI has a fish stock management
programme that restores fish populations in affected areas. Fish stock
management has also been used to enhance the status of fisheries and to
protect and conserve species. [ Read more about fish farms in Ireland
