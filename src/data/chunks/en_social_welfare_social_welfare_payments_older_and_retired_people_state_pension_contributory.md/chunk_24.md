system/claiming-a-social-welfare-payment/claiming-an-increase-in-your-social-
welfare-payment-for-an-adult-dependant/) (called an increase for qualified
adult or IQA). An adult dependant is your spouse, civil partner or [
cohabitant ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/birth-family-
relationships/cohabiting-couples/rights-of-cohabiting-couples/#e6e823) .

Your income is **not** taken into account in the assessment for an IQA.

The DSP takes any income your adult dependant has from employment, self-
employment, savings, investments and capital (for example, any property except
your own home) into account. If you have joint savings or investments with
your adult dependant, only half is taken into account.

If you are getting a State Pension (Contributory), the IQA is automatically
paid directly to your adult dependant.
