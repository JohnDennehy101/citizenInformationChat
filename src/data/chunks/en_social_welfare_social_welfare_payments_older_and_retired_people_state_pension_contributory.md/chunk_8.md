####  **Entry into insurance**

The date you first started paying PRSI is called your date of ‘entry into
insurance’. Your date of entry into insurance is also important when you
calculate your yearly average number of PRSI contributions – see ‘Yearly
average or total number of contributions’ below.

Your ‘entry into insurance _’_ is the date of the first paid PRSI contribution
made when you started your first job. However, this may not be the case if you
either:

  * Have mixed PRSI contributions 
  * Were self-employed.
