###  **When to apply for your State Pension (Contributory)**

When you apply for your State Pension (Contributory) depends on your personal
circumstances. In general, you should apply **3 months** before you reach 66.
However, if you have paid social insurance contributions in more than one
country, you should apply **6 months** before you reach 66.

welfare/social-welfare-payments/older-and-retired-people/deferring-your-state-
pension-contributory/#10ea51) up to the age of 70.

is a delay in processing your claim.
