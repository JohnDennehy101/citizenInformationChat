####  **Alternative average rule**

The ‘alternative average rule’ says you must have an average of 48 Class A, E,
F, G, H, N or S contributions (paid or credited) for each contribution year.
This rule applies from the 1979-1980 tax year to the end of the tax year
before you reach pension age.

If you have this average of 48 contributions, you are entitled to the maximum
pension. You cannot get a reduced pension when this alternative average is
used.
