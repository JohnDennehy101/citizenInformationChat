##  People getting Jobseeker's Allowance or Jobseeker's Benefit

If you are getting [ Jobseeker's Allowance (JA) ](/en/social-
welfare/unemployed-people/jobseekers-allowance/) or [ Jobseeker's Benefit (JB)
](/en/social-welfare/unemployed-people/jobseekers-benefit/) , you _must_
transfer to BTEA to keep a social welfare payment (including secondary
benefits) during full-time education. The reason for this is that you cannot
be genuinely available for and seeking employment when participating in full-
time education.

If you qualify for the Back to Education Allowance, you can keep your
entitlement to any secondary benefits you already have, for example, Fuel
Allowance, Rent Supplement and Mortgage Interest Supplement. Since the
2016/2017 academic year, people getting BTEA who take up work during the
academic year will be assessed under the rules (including means assessment)
that apply to their primary payment - the payment they qualified for BTEA
from. This only applies new applicants or people who return to BTEA after a
break. You can find further information about [ part-time work and BTEA on the
Department's website ](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/a65a07-operational-
guidelines-education-training-and-
development/?referrer=https://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/Back-to-Education---
Education-Training-and-Development-Opti.aspx) and in the [ Back to Education
Programme (pdf)
](https://assets.gov.ie/38609/7667d260d355450bba7cb3b9d8cfe0f8.pdf) .

Once you transfer from JA or JB to the BTEA, you are not eligible for the
maintenance component of the student grant but you can apply for a fee grant –
covering the student contribution, field trip costs and fees (if payable)
under the student grant scheme. You should do this as soon as possible.

People coming from jobseeker’s payments or Farm Assist are paid BTEA for the
academic year only and not for the summer months between academic years.
