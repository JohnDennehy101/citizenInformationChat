##  Student Grant Scheme

Students doing full-time higher education undergraduate/postgraduate courses
and full-time [ Post Leaving Certificate Courses (PLCs)
](/en/education/further-education-and-training/post-leaving-certificate-
courses/) may get financial support through the means-tested [ Student Grant
Scheme ](/en/education/third-level-education/fees-and-supports-for-third-
level-education/student-grant-scheme/) . Grant rates for qualifying students
vary according to a number of factors, including household income, family size
and whether the student's college is close to their permanent residence. Since
2012, new postgraduate students do not qualify for a full student grant but
they may qualify for a partial grant (see below) if they pass particular means
tests.

The scheme is made up of 3 components - a maintenance grant, a fee grant and a
postgraduate contribution. The maintenance grant is a contribution towards the
studentâ€™s living costs. The fee grant can cover any of the following 3
elements: tuition fees, students contribution and cost of essential field
trips. The postgraduate contribution may be payable to a postgraduate who
passes a special means test.

In general if you qualify for a maintenance grant you will also qualify for
whatever elements of a fee grant apply to your situation.
