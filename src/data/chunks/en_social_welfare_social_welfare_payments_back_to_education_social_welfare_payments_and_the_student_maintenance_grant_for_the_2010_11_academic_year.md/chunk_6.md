###  Fee grant

If you are getting the BTEA you do not qualify for the maintenance component
of the student grant but you _can_ apply for a fee grant to cover the student
contribution and any course tuition fees not already covered by the [ Free
Fees Scheme ](/en/education/third-level-education/fees-and-supports-for-third-
level-education/fees/) . Essential field trip costs may also be covered under
a fee grant.

Please note, however, that people getting BTEA may not qualify for payment of
a fee grant – unless they meet the terms and conditions of the student grant
scheme. If you are getting the BTEA and wish to apply for these charges to be
covered by a fee grant you should apply for a grant as soon as possible.

If you are doing a [ Post-Leaving Certificate (PLC)
](../../../education/vocational_education_and_training/training_and_apprentiship_programmes/post_leaving_certificate_courses.en.html)
course and getting the BTEA or a [ VTOS allowance ](/en/education/further-
education-and-training/vocational-training-opportunities-scheme/) you are
exempt from the student participant charge (€200). You may have to pay a
course charge for books, exam fees and other costs.
