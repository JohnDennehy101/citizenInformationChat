##  Withdrawing your application or appeal

Before you withdraw your application, you should get legal advice. You should
make sure you understand the consequences of your decision.

If your application for international protection is still being [ processed
](/en/moving-country/asylum-seekers-and-refugees/the-asylum-process-in-
ireland/how-refugee-applications-commissioner-deals-with-applications/) , you
can withdraw your application by writing to the IPO. You should include your
address and your reference number. You must sign the letter. If your children
are part of your international protection application, you should include
their details too.

If you already got a recommendation from the IPO and you have [ appealed
](/en/moving-country/asylum-seekers-and-refugees/the-asylum-process-in-
ireland/if-your-application-for-refugee-status-is-refused/) to the
International Protection Appeals Tribunal (IPAT), you can withdraw your appeal
by writing to IPAT.

When the [ Minister is notified ](/en/moving-country/asylum-seekers-and-
refugees/the-asylum-process-in-ireland/minister-for-justice/) of your
withdrawal, they will refuse to give you either a declaration of refugee
status or a declaration of subsidiary protection. Your solicitor will be
notified. You cannot appeal this decision.

The Minister may arrange for your removal from Ireland unless you have other
permission to remain in the State, or you have agreed to leave voluntarily.
