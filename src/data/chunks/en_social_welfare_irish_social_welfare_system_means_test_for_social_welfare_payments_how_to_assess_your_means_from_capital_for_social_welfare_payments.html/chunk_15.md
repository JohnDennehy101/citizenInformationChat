##  Assessment of capital for couples

If you have a joint account with your spouse, civil partner or cohabitant,
legally the total amount in the account is owned by each of you. This means it
could be assessed in full against each of you.

However, if you and your spouse, civil partner or cohabitant are both getting
means-tested [ social assistance payments ](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-
welfare-system/social-assistance-payments/social-assistance-in-ireland/) , it
will be assessed either on a shared basis or against only one of you.
