###  Second homes and income from lettings

The home in which you live is **not** included in the assessment of your means
from capital (see above). If you own a house which is let, you are assessed on
the capital value of the property. **You will not be assessed on the income
from the letting.** Any outstanding mortgage registered against the property
is deducted from the market value to find the capital value.

However, if the mortgage on the home in which you live has been re-structured
to raise capital to buy the second property, this re-structured mortgage will
not be deducted from the capital assessment of the second property.

For all second homes, the property must be capable of being sold, let or put
to profitable use before a capital value assessment is applied.
