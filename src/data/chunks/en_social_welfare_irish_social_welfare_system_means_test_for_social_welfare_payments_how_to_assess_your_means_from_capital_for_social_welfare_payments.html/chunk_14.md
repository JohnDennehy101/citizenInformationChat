####  Situations where rental income is assessed

Usually, income from renting a property is not assessed. However, there are
some situations where rental income is assessed:

  * If you have a life interest in a property, the DSP assesses the rental income instead of the capital value. 
  * If you are claiming an increase for a qualified adult with your [ social insurance payment ](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/social-insurance-prsi/social-insurance/) , and if your spouse, civil partner or cohabitant owns property (in their own right or jointly with you), then the DSP assesses rental income from this property for payment of an [ Increase for a Qualified Adult ](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/claiming-a-social-welfare-payment/claiming-an-increase-in-your-social-welfare-payment-for-an-adult-dependant/) . This rental income is assessed as cash in the means test, and the capital value of the property is not assessed. However, the capital value will be assessed in the normal way if the property is not rented – see ‘Capital value’ above. 
  * If you apply for Working Family Payment (WFP), the DSP will take rental income from the letting of property or land into account when assessing your income (the capital value is not assessed).
