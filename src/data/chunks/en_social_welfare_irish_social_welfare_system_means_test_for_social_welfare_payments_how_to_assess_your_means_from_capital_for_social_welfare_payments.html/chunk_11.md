####  Investment income from the sale of your home

Any benefit you get from investing the sale proceeds is assessable as means.
Any interest paid and retained is assessable as capital.

However, the Department of Social Protection’s [ Operational Guidelines on
Means Assessment ](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/11f23e-means-assessment-
guidelines/#:~:text=Investment%20income%20from,disregarded%20as%20means.) say
an allowance should be made where you have significant maintenance expenses,
such as nursing home costs, which are met out of interest payments. In this
case, the interest on the exempted capital (up to a maximum of €190,500) may
be disregarded as means.
