###  **Selling your home**

If you sell your home, the proceeds of the sale are normally taken into
account as means.

However, if you live in accommodation which no longer suits you, or which you
are no longer able to maintain, you may choose to sell your home and move to
more suitable accommodation. In this case, up to €190,500 of the sale proceeds
is exempt from the means test.

This exemption only applies if you are getting one of the following payments:

  * State Pension (Non-Contributory) 
  * Disability Allowance 
  * [ Blind Pension ](/en/social-welfare/disability-and-illness/blind-persons-pension/)

In addition, you must be selling your house in order to:

  * Buy or rent more suitable alternative accommodation 
  * Move into a private nursing home which is registered under the Health (Nursing Homes) Act 1990 
  * Move in with a person who getting a carer’s payment to care for you 
  * Move to sheltered or special housing in the voluntary, co-operative, statutory or private sectors. 

Usually, the first €190,500 of the sale proceeds is not taken into account.
However, if you use the proceeds of the sale to buy more suitable
accommodation, the balance of the proceeds **after** buying the new
accommodation is exempt up to a limit of €190,500.
