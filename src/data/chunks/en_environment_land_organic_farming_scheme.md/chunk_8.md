###  **Can I add or remove land from my OFS contract?**

Yes, you can add or remove land from your OFS contract after your contact has
started. So, if you buy land during the contract, you can add it to the scheme
and get paid for it.

You can add land that is already fully converted to organics in any year of
your contract. However, you can only add land that still has to be converted
to organics during the first 4 years of the OFS contract.

You must add the land to your organic licence before 1 January of the year you
want to include it. You must also declare it on your BISS application. You
will not be paid for part of a year.

If you are reducing the land you have in the OFS scheme, your annual payment
will be reduced to reflect this. In general, if you have already been paid for
an area that is being removed, you will have to pay this back with interest.

This will not apply in certain circumstances, for example, if you retire from
farming and have completed 3 years on the scheme.
