###  **How do I get my payments?**

To get your OFS payments, you must make a payment claim before the BISS
deadline each year. This is done through your BISS application online at
agfood.ie. You will only be paid for the land you have registered on your BISS
application as ‘organic’ or ‘in-conversion’.

To qualify for the in-conversion rate of payment for the maximum 2 years, you
must apply for the scheme within 4 months of getting your organic licence.
