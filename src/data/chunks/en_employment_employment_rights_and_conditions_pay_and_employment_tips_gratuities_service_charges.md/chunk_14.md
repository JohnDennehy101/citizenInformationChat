##  Display of tips and gratuities notice

Customers have the right to know what service charges are used for and who
they go to.

Since 1 December 2022, employers must clearly display their policy on how cash
and card tips, gratuities and service charges are distributed.

The tips and gratuities notice must clearly state:

  * Whether or not tips or gratuities are distributed to and among staff 
  * The way they are distributed and the amounts distributed 
  * Whether or not service charges (or any portion of them) are distributed and if so, how they are distributed and the amounts distributed 

You can see a sample tips and gratuities notice in Appendix 1 of the Workplace
Relations Commission (WRC) [ Information Guide to the Payment of Wages
(Amendment) (Tips and Gratuities) Act 2022 (pdf)
