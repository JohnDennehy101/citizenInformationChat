###  Distribution of card or smart phone tips

Electronic tips received by the employer must be distributed fairly and in a
transparent way.

Electronic tips include tips paid by:

  * Debit or credit card 
  * Smart card 
  * Cashless or contactless tipping apps or platforms 
  * ‘Push notification’ apps 

Employers can consider certain factors when deciding how to distribute tips,
including:

  * Seniority or experience 
  * The value of sales or revenue generated 
  * The number of hours worked 
  * Whether the worker is on a full-time or part-time contract 
  * The worker’s role in service delivery 

Your employer must give you a statement of the tips and gratuities
distributed, including the total amount of electronic tips received during a
particular period and how much was paid to you. You must get this statement
within 10 days of the tips and gratuities being distributed.
