###  Distribution of cash tips

Cash tips are usually paid directly to the worker.

If tips are managed by employees themselves, for example under a ‘tronc’
system, the distribution rules above do not apply.

However, employers must set out how cash tips are distributed in its publicly
displayed Tips and Gratuities Notice’ – see below.
