##  How the rules are enforced

All electronic tips received by the employer must be distributed fairly and in
a transparent way.

This will be inspected through the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC).

Businesses found breaching the rules can get on-the-spot fines of:

  * €1,500 for not providing employees with their terms of employment or giving false information 
  * €750 for not giving employees a written statement about how tips and gratuities are distributed 
  * €750 for not treating a service charge as a tip 
  * €500 for not displaying a tips and gratuities notice or a contract workers tips and gratuities notice. 

The WRC can order an employer to reimburse any unlawful tip or gratuity
deductions.
