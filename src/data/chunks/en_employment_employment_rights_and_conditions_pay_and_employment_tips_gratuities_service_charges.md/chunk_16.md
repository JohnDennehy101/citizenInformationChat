##  How to make a complaint

If you are not getting the tips you are due, you should speak with your
employer first.

If you cannot resolve the problem with your employer, you can make a formal
complaint to the WRC.

You must make your complaint using the [ online complaint form
](https://www.workplacerelations.ie/en/complaints_disputes/refer_a_dispute_make_a_complaint/)
within 6 months of the dispute or complaint occurring. This time limit may be
extended for a further 6 months, but only where there is a reasonable cause
which prevented you from bringing the complaint within the normal time limit.
