##  Can I cut my neighbour’s hedge?

A tree or hedge on a boundary is generally the property of both you and your
neighbour. You cannot cut down the tree or hedge without your neighbour’s
permission.

Overhanging branches or roots encroaching on your land can be cut back without
permission, but only as far as the boundary line. You should still discuss
this with your neighbour to avoid disagreements.

You should ensure that the tree is not the subject of a tree preservation
order. Tree preservation orders are made by the local authority. You should
check with the local authority before cutting back or taking any action
against a tree that is subject to a tree preservation order.
