##  How do I report illegal hedge cutting?

If you see someone illegally cutting a hedge, you should report it to:

  * Your [ local National Parks and Wildlife Services (NPWS) office ](https://www.npws.ie/contact-us)
  * Your [ local Garda station ](https://www.garda.ie/en/contact-us/station-directory/)

Since whoever you report the crime to may not be able to respond immediately,
you should make note of certain information, such as the following:

  * Time and date of the incident 
  * Registration of any vehicles involved 

It may also be useful to take a photo of the incident, especially to record
the vehicle registration number. However, you don’t need to send these to the
NPWS or Gardaí when reporting the incident.
