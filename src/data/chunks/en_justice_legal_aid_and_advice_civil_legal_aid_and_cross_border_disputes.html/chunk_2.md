##  Introduction

If you are living in Ireland and have a legal dispute in another EU country
(except Denmark) you may be able to get legal aid in the other country. Access
to legal aid in cross border disputes for residents of EU member states is
provided under [ Council Directive 2003/8/EC ](http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-
content/EN/TXT/?qid=1435070967106&uri=URISERV:l33184) which established
minimum common rules relating to legal aid for such disputes. An application
form for legal aid was established by [ Commission Decision 2004/844/EC (pdf)
](http://eur-
lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2004:365:0027:0034:EN:PDF) ,
while [ Commission Decision 2005/630/EC (pdf) ](http://eur-
lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2005:225:0023:0027:EN:PDF)
established a form for the sending of applications between countries.

The appropriate authority in Ireland to apply to for legal aid if you are
involved in a cross border dispute is the [ Legal Aid Board
](/en/justice/legal-aid-and-advice/legal-aid-board/) .
