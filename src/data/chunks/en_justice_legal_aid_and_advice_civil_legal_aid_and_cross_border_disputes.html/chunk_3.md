##  Rules

Each member state has its own financial rules and eligibility criteria. They
are modified to some extent for applicants and should take into consideration
differences in the cost of living between the country you are living in and
the country where you have the legal dispute.

The [ scope of legal aid schemes ](/en/justice/legal-aid-and-advice/legal-aid-
board/) and the qualifying criteria can differ between countries. As a result,
where you may get legal aid in Ireland for a particular legal dispute, you may
not qualify for legal aid in another country due to the differences in the
schemes. Similarly, you may qualify for legal aid abroad, when you would not
qualify in Ireland. In deciding whether to grant legal aid, the importance of
the case to the applicant should be taken into account.
