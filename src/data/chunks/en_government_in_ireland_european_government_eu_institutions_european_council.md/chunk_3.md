##  What does the European Council do?

The European Council has a number of important functions:

  * It decides on the political and policy direction of the EU 
  * It sets the EU’s foreign and security policies 
  * It nominates and appoints important EU roles 
  * It has a formal role in the EU’s European semester process 

The European Council does not have the power to make laws, but it can ask the
[ European Commission ](/en/government-in-ireland/european-government/eu-
institutions/european-commission/) to propose laws.

The Council meets 4 times per year at least. It usually adopts 'conclusions'
at its formal meetings. Conclusions set out the EU's position on key policy
matters.

The European Council mostly takes its decisions by consensus. This means that
no member opposes the decision. However, in certain specific cases outlined in
the EU treaties, it decides by taking a vote. If a vote is taken, neither the
European Council President nor the Commission President takes part.
