##  Social welfare and tax

If the deceased person was getting a social welfare payment or you were
claiming for them as a dependant, or you were getting a [ Carer's Allowance
](/en/social-welfare/carers/carers-allowance/) to look after them, you should
notify the Department of Social Protection (DSP) that they have died. You do
this by sending a death certificate (if you have one) or a death notice from a
newspaper to the [ section of the DSP that was paying them
](https://www.gov.ie/en/collection/ff767-social-welfare-schemes-and-services/)
.

There are also [ payments provided by the Department of Social Protection
](/en/social-welfare/death-related-benefits/benefits-and-entitlements-
following-a-death/) that are available to assist families with funeral costs.
You may also be entitled to a death related benefit (for example, a Widow’s,
Widower’s or Surviving Civil Partner’s Pension).
