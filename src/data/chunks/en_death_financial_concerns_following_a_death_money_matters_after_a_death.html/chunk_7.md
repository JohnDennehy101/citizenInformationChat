###  Mortgages

If you have a mortgage that was taken out with your loved one, you should
check if repayments are covered by [ mortgage protection insurance
](/en/housing/owning-a-home/buying-a-home/insurance-protection-on-mortgages/)
.

If it is not covered, then you have to continue repaying the mortgage. If you
have difficulty in paying, you should talk to your mortgage provider. You can
also get advice from MABS.
