##  Guardianship

Guardianship rights entitle the parent of a child to make important decisions
regarding that child, for example, decisions about the child's religion,
education, medical treatment and where the child lives. All mothers,
irrespective of whether they are married or unmarried, have automatic
guardianship status in relation to their children, unless they place the child
up for adoption.

Fathers married to the mother of their children also have automatic
guardianship rights. A father, however, who is not married to the mother of
their child or children does not have automatic guardianship rights in
relation to that child or children. Find out [ more about guardianship here

children in the event of their own death.
