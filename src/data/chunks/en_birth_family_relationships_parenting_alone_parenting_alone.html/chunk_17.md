##  Custody and access

Custody refers to the day-to-day care, residency and upbringing of children
who are under the age of 18. The children reside permanently with the parent
who has [ custody ](/en/birth-family-relationships/cohabiting-couples/custody-
of-children-cohabiting-couples/) and the other parent is granted [ access
](/en/birth-family-relationships/cohabiting-couples/access-to-children-
cohabiting-couples/) to the children at agreed times, which can include
overnight access. It is possible for parents to continue to have joint custody
of their children after separation or divorce and for the children to spend an
equal amount of time with each parent if the parents can agree and arrange
this.

[ Access ](/en/birth-family-relationships/cohabiting-couples/access-to-
children-cohabiting-couples/) is the right of a child to maintain direct
contact with the parent that they do not live with. It can include the child
staying overnight either occasionally, on alternate weekends or during school
holidays and for the parent and child going on holidays together.

When the parents of a child separate and they cannot agree on who should have
custody of the child, the court decides. An unmarried mother is sometimes the
sole guardian of a child born outside of marriage. However, it is not
necessary for the father to have guardianship to be able to apply for [ access
](/en/birth-family-relationships/cohabiting-couples/access-to-children-
cohabiting-couples/) or [ custody ](/en/birth-family-relationships/cohabiting-
couples/custody-of-children-cohabiting-couples/) .
