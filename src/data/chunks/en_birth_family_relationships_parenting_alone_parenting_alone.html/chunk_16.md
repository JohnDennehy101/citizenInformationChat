###  Kinship care

In some circumstances, grandparents, other relatives or a family friend may
take on the full-time care of children and young people, when parents are not
able to care for them. Sometimes this is called kinship care. Many kinship
care arrangements are informal unlike [ relative foster care ](/en/birth-
family-relationships/adoption-and-fostering/fostering/) which is a formal
arrangement. Depending on how your kinship family is formed there are
different routes to secure your legal relationship with and responsibility for
the children and young people in your care.
