####  Parent’s leave and Parent’s Benefit

[ Parent’s leave ](/en/employment/employment-rights-and-conditions/leave-and-
holidays/parents-leave/) is a statutory entitlement for working parents. The
paid leave lets parents spend more time with their baby or adopted child
during the first 2 years. [ Parent’s Benefit ](/en/social-welfare/families-
and-children/parents-benefit/) is paid while you are on parent’s leave from
work if you have enough social insurance (PRSI) contributions.

From 1 August 2024, Parent's Benefit increases from 7 weeks to 9 weeks. The
extra 2 weeks apply to children who are under the age of 2 on 1 August 2024,
and adoptive children who have been placed with their family for less than 2
years on 1 August 2024.
