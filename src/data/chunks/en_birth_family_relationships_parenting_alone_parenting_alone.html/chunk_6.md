####  Adoptive leave

[ Adoptive leave ](/en/employment/employment-rights-and-conditions/leave-and-
holidays/adoptive-leave/) provides 24 weeks’ leave from work to one parent of
the adopting couple or a parent who is adopting alone. The 24 weeks start from
the date the child is placed in your care. If you have enough PRSI
contributions, you may be able to get [ Adoptive Benefit ](/en/social-
welfare/families-and-children/adoptive-benefit/) . It is available to both
employees and self-employed people.

You can take up to 16 additional weeks’ unpaid adoptive leave but you cannot
claim [ Adoptive Benefit ](/en/social-welfare/families-and-children/adoptive-
benefit/) for these extra weeks.
