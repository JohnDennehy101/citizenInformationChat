###  If you cannot afford to repay the overpayment

The Department will suggest a repayment method that it believes you can
afford. If you cannot afford to repay the amount you were overpaid, the
repayment may be reduced, deferred or suspended. If your circumstances
subsequently improve, you will be required to repay the amount owed at a rate
you can afford. If you do not repay social welfare overpayments, the
Department of Social Protection may take a civil case against you through the
[ courts system ](/en/justice/courts-system/courts/) . If your overpayment
arose as a result of fraud you may be criminally prosecuted (see ‘Fraud’
below).
