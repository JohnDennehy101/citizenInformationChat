###  When is repayment reduced or cancelled?

The Department of Social Protection makes every effort to recover the
overpayment in full. The Department may reduce or cancel an overpayment if it
occurred because it:

  * Failed to act within a reasonable period of time on information it received about you 
  * Made an mistake that you could not reasonably be expected to have noticed 

If you think that the Department has made an error, you should bring the
matter to the Department's attention as soon as possible.
