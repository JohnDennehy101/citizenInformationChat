##  Repaying an overpayment

The Department can ask you to repay the overpayment by:

  * Making a single payment to repay the full overpayment 
  * Making weekly or monthly cash repayments until the overpayment is paid off 
  * If you are still getting a social welfare payment, by deductions from your weekly payment (and by withholding any arrears of payment that may be due to you) 

When deciding the rate of repayment, the Department will look at the following
factors:

  * Your ability to repay 
  * Any relevant facts or circumstances that you have raised 
  * The amount of the overpayment and how it happened 

The [ Social Welfare Act 2012
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2012/act/43/enacted/en/print#sec13)
changed the procedure for repayments of overpayments. 15% can be taken from
the personal weekly rate of your social welfare payment to pay back an
overpayment. Before that you had to give your written consent for any
deduction that brought your payment below the weekly rate of Supplementary
Welfare Allowance for your family circumstances.

Deductions of up to 15% can be also made from your earnings [ (under section
15 of the Social Welfare and Pensions (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2013
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2013/act/20/section/15/enacted/en/html#sec15)
. An overpayment can also be taken from money that you hold in a bank or other
financial institution. It is also possible that you may not be able to
withdraw money from a bank account (for example) until the overpayment has
been repaid. You must be notified in writing before deductions can take place.

**Note:** Since 1 August 2014, under the [ Recovery of Certain Benefits and
Assistance (RBA) Scheme ](http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/Recovery-of-Benefits-
and-Assistance.aspx) the Department of Social Protection can recover the value
of certain [ illness-related social welfare payments ](/en/social-
welfare/disability-and-illness/benefits-to-people-who-are-sick-or-have-a-
disability/) from compensation awards made following non-fatal personal
injuries claims. This procedure is different from the recovery of overpayments
covered in this document.
