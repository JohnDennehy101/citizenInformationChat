##  Can I get a European Health Insurance Card?

You can only apply for a European Health Insurance Card:

  * If you live in Ireland 
  * If you live in another European Union (EU), European Economic Area (EEA) member state, or Switzerland 

If you live in Ireland but you are linked to another EU/EEA State's Social
Security System, contact the health authorities in that country for more
information.

If you live in Northern Ireland but are employed in Ireland, you can get an

Frontier workers (or [ cross-border workers ](/en/government-in-

EHIC because they make social security contributions in Ireland. They must
return home at least once a week to qualify.

Student dependants of frontier workers can get an Irish-issued EHIC. They must
be aged 18 to 23 years, studying in the EU/EEA or Switzerland and have a
