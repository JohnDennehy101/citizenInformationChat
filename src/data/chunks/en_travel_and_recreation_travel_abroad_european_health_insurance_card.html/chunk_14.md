###  What if I don't have my EHIC before I travel?

If you don't have your European Health Insurance Card for any reason, you can
get a Temporary Replacement Certificate. This Certificate gives you the same
entitlement as the Card, but for a shorter period.

You can apply online for this Certificate, in-person or by post to your Local
Health Office. You can only receive a Temporary Replacement Certificate for
yourself.
