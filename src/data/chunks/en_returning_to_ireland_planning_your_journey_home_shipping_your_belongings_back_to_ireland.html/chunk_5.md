####  **How to measure your items in cubic feet**

  1. Measure the length, width and height of your belongings in inches 
  2. Multiply the length, width, and height together (L x W x H) 
  3. Divide your total by 1,728 (this is because there are 1,728 cubic inches in a cubic foot) 

Your answer is the size (‘volume’ or ‘capacity’) of your belongings in cubic
feet.
