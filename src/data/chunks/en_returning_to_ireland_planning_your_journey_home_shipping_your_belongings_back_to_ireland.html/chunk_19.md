##  How do I bring my car to Ireland?

If you bring your vehicle to Ireland, you must register the vehicle at a [
National Car Testing Service (NCTS) ](https://www.ncts.ie/1195/) centre. You
may also have to pay [ Vehicle Registration Tax (VRT)
](https://www.revenue.ie/en/importing-vehicles-duty-free-allowances/guide-to-
vrt/vehicle-registration-tax/index.aspx) .

If you’re importing a car or small van, the amount of VRT you pay is based on
a percentage of its recommended retail price, including all taxes. This is
known as the Open Market Selling Price (OMSP). Use [ Revenue’s VRT calculator
](https://www.ros.ie/evrt-enquiry/vrtenquiry.html?execution=e1s1) to estimate
how much VRT you will pay.

You can [ claim a relief from VRT ](https://www.revenue.ie/en/importing-
vehicles-duty-free-allowances/guide-to-vrt/reliefs-and-exemptions/transfer-of-
residence.aspx) if:

  * You are transferring your residence to Ireland (moving here permanently) 
  * You were using the vehicle for more than 6 months before you moved to Ireland 

In this case, you must still register your vehicle, but you do not have to pay
VRT.

If you are exempt from paying VRT, you cannot sell your vehicle for 12 months
after the vehicle is registered. If you are not exempt from paying VRT, you
can sell your vehicle in Ireland once it has been registered.

See how to claim this tax relief in our page [ Bringing your vehicle to
Ireland ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/returning-to-ireland/planning-
your-journey-home/bringing-your-vehicle-back-to-ireland/) .
