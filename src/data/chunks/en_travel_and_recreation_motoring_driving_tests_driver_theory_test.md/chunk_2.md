##  Introduction

The first step to learning to drive in Ireland is to pass the driver theory
test.

The theory test is a computer-based exam of motoring theory appropriate to [
the category of vehicle ](/en/travel-and-recreation/motoring/driver-
licensing/categories-of-motor-vehicles-and-minimum-age-of-drivers-in-ireland/)
you want to be licenced to drive. It checks your knowledge of:

  * The [ rules of the road ](https://www.rsa.ie/docs/default-source/road-safety/rules-of-the-road.pdf?sfvrsn=e0334acb_0)
  * Risk perception 
  * Eco-driving 
  * Hazard awareness 
  * Good driving behaviour 

You can take the driver theory test at any one of the [ test centres (pdf)
](https://theorytest.ie/wp-content/uploads/theory-test-ireland-test-centre-
location-map-051017.pdf) located around the country. While the test is
computer-based, it is designed to be user-friendly for people who have little
experience of using computers. The test can be done in Irish and English and [
candidates with special needs are catered for ](https://theorytest.ie/general-
information/test-day-assistance-support/) .

If you pass the test, you get a theory test certificate. You can then apply
for a [ learner permit ](/en/travel-and-recreation/motoring/driver-
licensing/learner-driving-permits-for-cars-and-work-vehicles/) and begin
learning to drive on Irish roads.
