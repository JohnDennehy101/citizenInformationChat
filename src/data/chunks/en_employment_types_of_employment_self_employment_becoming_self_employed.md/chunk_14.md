##  Paying PRSI as a self-employed person

If you are self-employed, you pay [ Class S PRSI contributions
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-
system/social-insurance-prsi/class-S-prsi/) . This entitles you to a limited
range of social insurance payments (for example, you are not covered for any
short-term payments, including illness and disability payments).

Class S PRSI contributions are paid at a rate of 4% on all income, or €500,
whichever is the greater. If you earn less than €5,000 from self-employment in
a year, you are exempt from paying Class S PRSI but you may pay €500 as a [
voluntary contributor ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-
welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/social-insurance-prsi/voluntary-prsi-
contributions/) .

When you register with Revenue (see ‘Paying tax as a self-employed person’
above), you are automatically registered for Class S PRSI. You can get
information on PRSI for the self-employed from [ your local Intreo Centre or
Social Welfare Branch Office ](http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/List-of-Social-
Welfare-Local-and-Branch-Offices-by-County.aspx) .

You can also contact the Self-Employment Section of the Department of Social
Protection – see contact details under ‘More information’ below. Or, you can
read the Department’s [ leaflet about PRSI for the Self-Employed (pdf)
](https://assets.gov.ie/38671/0aa2cf3d831a4076b1b6208e1287d9f9.pdf) .
