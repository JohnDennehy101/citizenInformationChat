##  Registering your business name

If you want to use a business name, you must register the name with the
Companies Registration Office (CRO) **within one month of adopting the
business name** .

You can do this in 2 ways:

  * Download and complete the paper form [ RBN1 (pdf) ](https://www.cro.ie/Portals/0/Business%20Names%20Forms/RBN1%20v2%20fillable.pdf) . There is a €40 fee to register a business name using the paper form. Visit the CRO website for [ information on payment methods ](https://www.cro.ie/en-ie/Publications/Fees/Payment-Methods)
  * [ Register online using CORE ](https://core.cro.ie/registration/sign-up) (Companies Online Registration Environment). There is a €20 fee to register your business name electronically 

You will then get a ‘Certificate of Registration’, which you must display
prominently at your place of business. In general, you will need the
Certificate of Registration to open a business bank account (a business
account lets you keep your business income separate from your personal
income).
