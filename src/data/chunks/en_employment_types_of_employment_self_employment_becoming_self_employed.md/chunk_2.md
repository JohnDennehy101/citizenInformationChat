##  Introduction

When you start working for yourself, you are classed as ‘self-employed’ and a
‘sole trader’. A _sole trader_ is when you set up a business on your own.

In general, you are a self-employed sole trader if you:

  * Run your own business and are responsible for its successes and failures 
  * Have several customers 
  * Regularly sell goods or services to make a profit 
  * Are paid for the service you provide 
  * Decide how, when and where you work 

It is relatively easy to become a sole trader (see ‘How to become a sole
trader’ below). However, if your business fails, your personal assets could be
used to pay back your _creditors_ (people or organisation your business owes
money to).
