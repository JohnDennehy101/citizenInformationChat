##  Social media and defamation

The Defamation Act 2009 does not have any laws that are particularly aimed at
social media posts and social media companies, including messaging platforms.

If you post an allegation or an opinion about a person (or a corporation) on a
social media platform, that person or corporation could accuse you of
defamation.

If you post anonymously, you may still face court action. The subject of the
post can apply to the High Court for an order to compel the platform to
release information about the owner of the profile that made the post. This is
known as a _Norwich Pharmacal Order_ . It is named after one of the cases in
which it was first made.

The Government has announced that it will draft [ new legislation
](https://www.gov.ie/en/press-release/21b16-minister-mcentee-receives-cabinet-
approval-to-reform-irish-defamation-law/) to update the Defamation Act 2009,
including provisions for social media companies and posts.
