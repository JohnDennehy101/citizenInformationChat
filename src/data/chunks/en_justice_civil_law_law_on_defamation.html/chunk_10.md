###  Innocent publication

Innocent publication may apply where a person is not responsible for the
statement or the publication of the statement, but contributed to distributing
the statement in some way.

For example, a company that prints newspapers, or delivers newspapers to shops
is not responsible for the content of the newspapers and would not usually be
liable for defamation because of a statement carried by a newspaper they are
printing or distributing.

This defence has also been used by social media companies for defamatory posts
made on their platforms.
