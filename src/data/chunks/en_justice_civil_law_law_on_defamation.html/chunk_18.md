###  Damages

The amount of damages that may be awarded depend on a number of factors,
including the seriousness of the damage to the personâ€™s reputation. If the
complaint is heard in the High Court and there is a jury, the jury decides the
amount of damages that should be awarded. If it is in the [ Circuit Court
](/en/justice/courts-system/circuit-court/) or the [ High Court
](/en/justice/courts-system/high-court/) (and there is no jury), the judge
makes the decision.

The judge (or jury) should consider the actions of the person who made the
statement since the publication of the defamatory statement. This could
include if a correction or apology was issued.
