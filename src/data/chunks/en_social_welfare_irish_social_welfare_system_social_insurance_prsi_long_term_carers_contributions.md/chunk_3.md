##  Do I qualify?

To qualify, you must:

  * Have lived in Ireland when you were providing the care 
  * Have been over 16 years and under pension age when you provided care 
  * Not have been in employment, self-employment, voluntary work, training or education courses for more than 18.5 hours a week 
  * Not have been getting a weekly social welfare payment when you were caring, except for [ Carer's Allowance, ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/social-welfare-payments/carers/carers-allowance/) [ Carer's Benefit, ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/social-welfare-payments/carers/carers-benefit/) [ Domiciliary Care Allowance ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/social-welfare-payments/disability-and-illness/domiciliary-care-allowance/) or [ Carer's Support Grant ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/social-welfare-payments/carers/carers-support-grant/)
  * Have lived with the person you were caring for and provided full-time care and attention. In some circumstances, you may qualify if you did not live with the person being cared for, but you provided full-time care and attention 

Normally, you need 520 employment contributions (which is 10 years of work) to
[ qualify for State Pension (Contributory)
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/older-and-retired-
people/state-pension-contributory/#8cce01) . However, if you have been a full-
time carer for at least 20 years (1,040 weeks), you do not need to have worked
for 10 years to qualify for State Pension (Contributory).

If you think you qualify for Long-Term Carers Contributions, you should
contact the Pension Caring Supports Unit of the Department of Social
Protection (see ‘Contact details’ below).
