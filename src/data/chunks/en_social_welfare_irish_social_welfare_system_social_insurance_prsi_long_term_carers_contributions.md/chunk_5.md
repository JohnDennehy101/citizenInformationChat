##  What counts as full-time care?

To get a Long-Term Carers Contribution, you must be providing full-time care
to a person who needs full-time care.

A person is seen as needing full-time care when:

  * They need continual supervision to avoid danger to themselves, **or**
  * They need continual supervision and frequent assistance throughout the day with normal bodily functions. For example, help to walk and get about, eat or drink, get washed or dressed. 

The person being cared for must have the nature and extent of their disability
certified by a doctor.
