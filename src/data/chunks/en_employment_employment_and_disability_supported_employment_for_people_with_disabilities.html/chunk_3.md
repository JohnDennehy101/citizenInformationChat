##  Who can use the EmployAbility Service?

To use the EmployAbility Service, you must be between 18 and 65 and need
support in finding and getting a job.

You must also be _job ready_ . Job ready is having the necessary training,
education, motivation and ability to work.

The service is for people who genuinely need the support of a job coach to get
a job. See ‘What does a job coach do?’ below
