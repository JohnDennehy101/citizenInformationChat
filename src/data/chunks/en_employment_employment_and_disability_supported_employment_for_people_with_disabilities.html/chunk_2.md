##  What is the EmployAbility Service?

The [ EmployAbility Service ](https://www.gov.ie/en/service/8578c4-access-the-
employability-service/) is an employment and recruitment service that helps
people who have a disability, an injury or and an illness to get and to keep a
job. It gives a number of supports, such as a job coach who works with both
jobseekers and employers. It used to be called the Supported Employment
Service.

The EmployAbility Service works through sponsor organisations in local
communities on behalf of the Department of Social Protection(DSP) – see
‘Sponsor organisations’ below.
