##  How to find a job

When you and your job coach have identified and agreed on the type of work you
are interested in, the next stage is to apply for jobs.

You can do this either by applying for jobs that are [ advertised in the usual
way ](/en/employment/starting-work-and-changing-job/training-and-looking-for-
work/finding-and-getting-a-job/) or by your job coach helping you to apply for
jobs in your area. Sometimes, this can involve your job coach contacting
employers in your area or in your chosen field of work.

Job coaches provide continuing support in a number of ways, depending on what
you need. For example, they can help with on-the-job training and can support
you and the employer when you first start a job. Or they can provide support
and advice only when you ask for it.

During a placement, a job coach gives information, advice and ongoing support
to employers. Occasionally, the employer and employee may agree that the job
is not working out. If this happens, the job coach can then step in to assess
the situation and offer more support.

**What are sponsor organisations?**

The EmployAbility Service works through sponsor organisations. These are often
community and voluntary organisations in your local area that provide direct
services to people with disabilities. These [ sponsor organisations

Organisations.aspx) have job coaches who provide supports for jobseekers with
a disability, and for employers.
