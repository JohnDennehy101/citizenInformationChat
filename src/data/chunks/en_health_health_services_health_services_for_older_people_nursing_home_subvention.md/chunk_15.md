###  Appeals

If you are unhappy with a decision on your subvention, you may appeal to the
Appeals Officer in HSE Consumer Affairs in your local area. You may appeal
against the assessment of means and/or the amount of the subvention. You
should appeal within 28 days of receiving the notification of the decision.

You are entitled to know the details of the decision and the reasons for it.
Details of the means assessment should be provided by the HSE but if they are
not or they are not clear, you should look for further information.

The regulations do not say that you are entitled to an oral hearing but, if
you feel that would be an advantage, you should ask for one.

The appeals officer must give a decision on the appeal within 28 days.
Decisions of the appeal officer are subject to review by the [ Ombudsman
](/en/government-in-ireland/how-government-works/standards-and-
accountability/office-of-the-ombudsman/) and may be subject to judicial review
by the courts.
