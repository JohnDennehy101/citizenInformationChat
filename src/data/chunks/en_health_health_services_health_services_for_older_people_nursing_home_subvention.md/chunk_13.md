###  Review

If a major change occurs in your level of dependency or in your means, the
Health Service Executive (HSE) may review your entitlement to a subvention.
(They also have the power to review every 6 months but this does not happen
very often.) The HSE must hold a review if you or the person in charge of the
home requests them to do so.

The assessment of dependency and means in the review is carried out in the
same way as the initial assessment. As a result of the review, the HSE may
increase or decrease the subvention or withdraw it or offer accommodation in a
HSE home or make arrangements for your care in your own home. The existing
subvention is paid while the review is being conducted. If the HSE decide to
reduce or stop the subvention, it must notify you and continue to pay the
subvention for 28 days. You are entitled to appeal against any decision to
reduce or withdraw the subvention. If the appeal is successful the arrears of
subvention due will be paid.
