###  Selling your home

If you sell your home, the proceeds may be taken into account in the
assessment of your means for a nursing home subvention. (There is a social
welfare rule that allows the [ proceeds of a house sale ](/en/social-
welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/means-test-for-social-welfare-
payments/means-test/) to be disregarded in certain circumstances. This does
not apply to the nursing homes subvention means test).
