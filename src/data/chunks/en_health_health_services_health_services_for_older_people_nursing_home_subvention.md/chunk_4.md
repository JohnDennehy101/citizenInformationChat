###  The means test

**The means test described here applies only to people who continued on the
subvention scheme after the[ Nursing Home Support Scheme ](/en/health/health-
services/health-services-for-older-people/fair-deal-scheme/) was introduced on
27 October 2009. ** It takes into account the income of yourself and your
spouse (or partner). It may also take account of your assets (but not those of
a spouse or partner). Assets in joint names are assessed proportionately.

**Income**

The means test involves looking at the income that you and your spouse (or
partner) received in the previous 12 months. Income from all sources is taken
into account, including wages, salary, pension, allowances, payments for part-
time and seasonal work, income from rentals, investments and savings and all
contributions from all sources. Income is assessed net of [ social insurance
](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/social-insurance-prsi/social-
insurance/) (PRSI), income tax and the health contribution.

The income of a married or cohabiting person is taken to be half the total
income of the couple.

You may not deliberately try to reduce your income in order to qualify for a
subvention, e.g., by diverting it to someone else. If you do, this income may
be taken into account anyway, even if you no longer have access to it.

Your total income for the purposes of the means test is your net income less
one-fifth of the weekly rate of the [ State Pension (Non Contributory)
](/en/social-welfare/older-and-retired-people/state-pension-non-contributory/)
payable at the time. In effect, you must be allowed retain this amount, which
is sometimes referred to as pocket money.
