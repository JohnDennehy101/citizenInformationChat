###  Enhanced payments/Contracted Beds

There are circumstances in which the HSE may pay the full cost of a private
nursing home bed. This is the case where the HSE has what are called
"contracted beds" in private nursing homes. There are no clear rules about who
is entitled to a contracted bed or in what circumstances the HSE offers this
arrangement.

In some circumstances the HSE may make an 'enhanced' payment. When considering
an enhanced payment, the HSE will take account of the cost of care in the
area, the availability of public beds, the means of the applicant and any
other funds or assets that may be available to the applicant.

There is no entitlement to an enhanced subvention contribution; it is at the
discretion of the HSE. The availability of enhanced subvention is limited by
the amount of funding available for the scheme.

**Pocket Money**

When a person is being assessed for subvention, a sum equivalent to one fifth
of the State Pension (Non-contributory) is disregarded. This is often referred
to as "pocket money".
