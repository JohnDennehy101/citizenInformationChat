###  Payment of the subvention and payments for care

The subvention is paid to the proprietor of the nursing home and not directly
to you.

The charges for staying in the nursing home are agreed by you (or somebody
acting on your behalf) and the nursing home. The amount which you have to pay
is set out in the contract of care which must be given to you when you go into
the nursing home. The contract of care usually includes a clause which allows
for charges to be increased from time to time.

You may not be charged any more than the amount as agreed in the contract of
care. This means that there can be no further separate charges for bed and
board, nursing care appropriate to the level of dependency, incontinence wear
and bedding, laundry service and aids and appliances necessary to assist a
dependent person with the activities of daily living. A special service or
item of equipment must be the subject of a separate agreement between you and
the nursing home and must be set out in the contract of care.

If you have a nursing home subvention, you must be treated in the same way as
a person who does not have a subvention.
