##  Introduction

Ireland has many hedges (or hedgerows), usually found around the edges of
fields, land boundaries, or by the sides of roads. These hedges are natural
habitats for animals and can provide food and shelter for them, especially
birds.

Other benefits of having hedgerows include the following:

  * Providing food for insects (such as nectar for bees) 
  * Creating wildlife corridors 
  * Storing carbon 
  * Helping to mitigate fertilizer run off 

There are rules around what time of year you can cut hedges in Ireland. This
is to stop people cutting hedges during bird nesting season and to give birds
a chance to nest safely and to raise their young.

Other species which rely on hedges include:

  * Badgers 
  * Owls 
  * Hedgehogs 
  * Stoats 
  * Butterflies
