###  Deduction from your wages or from payments you get

You can choose to have your LPT deducted directly from:

  * Your salary, wages, or occupational pension 
  * Payments from the Department of Social Protection 
  * Payments by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine (if you have a herd number) 

This is called deduction at source. View the list of [ payments you can use to
pay LPT by deduction at source ](https://www.revenue.ie/en/property/local-
property-tax/paying-your-lpt/lpt-phased-payments-deduction-at-source.aspx) .

The deductions are spread evenly across the number of payments you get during
the year.

The Department of Social Protection will only deduct LPT from the amount of
your payment that is over â‚¬218. If that is not enough to pay your LPT, you
must use another payment method during the year to make the additional
payments.

You can pay by deduction at source using the [ LPT online service
