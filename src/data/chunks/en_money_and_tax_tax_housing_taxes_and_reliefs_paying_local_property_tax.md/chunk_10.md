##  Paying LPT arrears

If you have not filed an LPT Return or paid your LPT for previous years, you
should pay and file as soon as possible. If you do not pay the outstanding
amounts, Revenue will contact you and let you know how they intend to recover
the debt. Read more about [ paying LPT arrears
](https://www.revenue.ie/en/property/local-property-tax/paying-your-
lpt/paying-lpt-arrears-2013-2021.aspx) .

Revenue will also recover arrears of the [ Household Charge
](https://www.revenue.ie/en/property/local-property-tax/lpt-
for-2013/household-charge-hhc.aspx) (which is now collected through the LPT
system).

Collection methods include:

  * Mandatory deduction from your salary, wages or occupational pension 
  * Attachment of your bank account (this means taking money without your consent using an attachment order) 
  * Referral of the debt to a sheriff or a solicitor for collection 
  * The withholding of refunds of other taxes as payment against LPT due 

If you are self-employed and fail to pay your LPT or Household Charge arrears,
Revenue will not issue you a [ tax clearance certificate ](/en/money-and-
tax/tax/tax-clearance-certificate/) .
