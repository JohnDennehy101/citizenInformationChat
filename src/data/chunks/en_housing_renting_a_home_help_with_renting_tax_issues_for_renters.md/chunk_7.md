###  **If I pay rent directly to my landlord who lives abroad**

If you pay the rent directly to your landlord who lives abroad, you must
deduct 20% from the rent and pay this to Revenue. The deduction is 20%,
because 20% is the standard rate of tax.

This applies even if you pay your rent directly into their bank account,
whether in Ireland or abroad. **The deduction is not your tax relief, it is
tax to be paid to Revenue from your landlord's income.**

For example, your landlord lives in Germany and you pay them gross rent per
month of €1,000. First, work out the amount of tax to be deducted (€1,000 x
20% = €200). Now deduct the tax due from the gross rent you pay (€1,000 - €200
= €800). The net rent to be paid to your landlord is €800 per month. The
amount due to Revenue is the €200 per month that you deducted from the gross
rent of €1,000.
