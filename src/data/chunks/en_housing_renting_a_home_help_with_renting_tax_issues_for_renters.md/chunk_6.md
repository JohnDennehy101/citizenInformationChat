###  **If I pay rent through a collection agent**

If you pay your rent to a [ collection agent
](https://www.revenue.ie/en/property/rental-income/non-resident-
landlords/collection-agent.aspx) , you do not have to deduct tax from the
rent. A collection agent is someone who will account for any tax due to
Revenue.

A collection agent can be someone the landlord knows, like a friend or family
member, but are often a professional such as a letting agent or solicitor.
Since 1 July 2023, collection agents can withhold 20% of your rental payment
and pay it directly to Revenue through a new Non-Resident Landlord Withholding
Tax System (NLWT). This system is available in [ MyAccount
](https://www.ros.ie/myaccount-web/sign_in.html?execution=e2s1&lang=en) and [
ROS ](https://www.ros.ie/) .

Collection agents no longer have to submit a tax return for the non-resident
landlord. The landlord is responsible for filing their own tax return.
