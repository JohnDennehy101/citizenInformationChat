###  **How do I pay Revenue for the tax deducted from rent?**

You must account to Revenue for the tax that you deduct from the gross rent.
If you do not deduct tax from rent that you pay directly to a landlord living
outside Ireland, you are liable for any tax that should have been deducted,
not your landlord.

On 1 July 2023, the way you do this changed. You no longer have to use your
personal tax return to deduct tax from rent payments to your non-resident
landlord.

Instead, you now withhold 20% of your rent and pay it directly to Revenue
through a new Non-Resident Landlord Withholding Tax System (NLWT). This system
is available in [ MyAccount ](https://www.ros.ie/myaccount-
web/sign_in.html?execution=e2s1&lang=en) and [ ROS ](https://www.ros.ie/) .

You must make a [ Rental Notification
](https://www.revenue.ie/en/property/rental-income/nrlwt/tenants.aspx) when
you make these payments. The Rental Notification includes details about the
landlord and the rental property. You must make the Rental Notification and
20% payment to Revenue within 21 days of paying rent to the landlord.

You can set-up repeat Rental Notifications and payments in the new system.
This means that Rental Notifications and payments will be automatically made
to Revenue every month.

Revenue has detailed information about these changes [ on their website
](https://www.revenue.ie/en/property/rental-income/non-resident-
landlords/changes-from-01-july-2023.aspx) and in their [ guidance document
](https://www.revenue.ie/en/tax-professionals/tdm/income-tax-capital-gains-
