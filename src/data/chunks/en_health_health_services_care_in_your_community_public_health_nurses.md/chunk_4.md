###  Adult services

You can get basic nursing care, advice and assistance from a public health
nurse. They can refer you to other [ community care services
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/health/health-services/care-in-your-
community/community-care-services/#l7b1e0) such as [ physiotherapy
](/en/health/health-services/care-in-your-community/physiotherapy-services/) ,
[ chiropody ](/en/health/health-services/care-in-your-community/chiropody-
services/) and [ respite care ](/en/health/health-services/health-services-
for-people-with-disabilities/respite-care/) .

In some areas, public health nurses keep a register of older people and visit
them as part of their work. Sometimes, this is also provided for people with
disabilities.
