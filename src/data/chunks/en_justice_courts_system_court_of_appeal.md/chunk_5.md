##  Criminal matters

The Court of Appeal hears appeals against convictions or sentences given by
the [ Circuit Criminal Court ](/en/justice/courts-system/circuit-court/) , the
[ Central Criminal Court ](/en/justice/courts-system/high-court/) and the [
Special Criminal Court ](/en/justice/courts-system/special-criminal-court/) .
If you are convicted of [ an offence on indictment ](/en/justice/criminal-
law/criminal-offences/classification-of-crimes-in-criminal-cases#l689a5) you
can appeal to the Court of Appeal about:

  * The severity of the sentence, or 
  * An alleged miscarriage of justice 

The [ Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) ](https://www.dppireland.ie/) can
appeal to the Court of Appeal about:

  * The leniency of a sentence, or 
  * A decision not to order a retrial 

The DPP can also appeal a point of law from [ a trial on indictment
](/en/justice/criminal-law/criminal-trial/criminal-trial/) to the Court of
Appeal. This does not mean that the Court may overturn the verdict of "not
guilty". It simply clarifies the law for future cases.

Although criminal cases are heard and determined by 3 judges, the Court of
Appeal gives one judgment unless there is a constitutional issue involved.
This means that if one of the judges had a different opinion about the case,
it is not made public.
