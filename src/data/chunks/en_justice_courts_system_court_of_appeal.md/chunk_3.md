##  Structure of the Court

The Court of Appeal has up to 17 ordinary judges and the President of the
Court of Appeal. The President of the High Court and the Chief Justice are
additional judges of the Court of Appeal. The President of the Court of Appeal
assigns the work of the Court. Cases are normally heard and determined by 3
judges.

However, some interlocutory and procedural applications can be heard by the
President or another nominated judge alone. An interlocutory application is an
application for a temporary decision on an issue while the case is in progress
and awaiting a final decision. Procedural applications could include, for
example, an application for legal aid.
