##  Appealing Court of Appeal decisions

Decisions of the Court of Appeal can only be appealed to the Supreme Court, if
the Supreme Court accepts that:

  * The decision involves a matter of general public importance, or 
  * In the interests of justice, it is necessary that there is an appeal 

In exceptional circumstances, the Supreme Court may also hear an appeal direct
from the High Court – this is known as a ‘leapfrog appeal’ because the appeal
bypasses the Court of Appeal entirely.

However, leapfrog appeals are rare and the same requirements for leave to
appeal from the Court of Appeal apply to an application for leave from the
High Court. The decision must involve a matter of general public importance
or, in the interests of justice, it must be necessary that there be an appeal
to the Supreme Court.
