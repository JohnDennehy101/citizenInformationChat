###  Employer must be fair and cannot discriminate when selecting employees

When selecting employees for lay-off or short-time working, employers should
apply the same criteria for selection as for redundancy. The criteria should
be reasonable and applied fairly.

For example, the custom and practice in the workplace may be last in, first
out, or the contract of employment may set out criteria for selection.

Under [ employment equality law ](http://www.ihrec.ie/publications/list/ihrec-
employment-equality-rights-explained/) , the selection must not discriminate
against employees on any of the following 9 grounds:

  * Gender 
  * Civil status 
  * Family status 
  * Age 
  * Disability 
  * Religious belief 
  * Race 
  * Sexual orientation or 
  * Membership of the Traveller community
