##  What social welfare payments can I get during a lay-off or short-time
working?

There are social welfare supports available, depending on your situation.

If you are laid off or are on short-time working, you may be entitled to [
Jobseeker’s Benefit ](/en/social-welfare/unemployed-people/jobseekers-
benefit/) or [ Jobseeker’s Allowance ](/en/social-welfare/unemployed-
people/jobseekers-allowance/) .

If you are getting [ Working Family Payment ](/en/social-welfare/families-and-
children/working-family-payment/) , this may be affected by the reduction in
your working hours.
