###  You still receive public holiday benefit during lay-off or short-time

and your contract of employment remains valid. This means that you are
entitled to benefit for any [ public holidays ](/en/employment/employment-
rights-and-conditions/leave-and-holidays/public-holidays/) that occur during
the first 13 weeks of lay-off.

Part-time employee must have worked at least 40 hours in the 5 weeks before
the public holiday to receive this benefit.

conditions/leave-and-holidays/annual-leave/) during lay-off, but you are
entitled to take annual leave that you built up before being laid off.
