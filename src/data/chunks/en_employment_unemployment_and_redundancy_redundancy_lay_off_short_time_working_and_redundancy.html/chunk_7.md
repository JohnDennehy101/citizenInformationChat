###  Employer must give you notice and keep you informed

Your employer should explain the reason for the lay-off or short-time working
to you. They should keep you informed of the situation during the period of
lay-off or short-time working.

Both a lay-off or short-time must be temporary situations and your employer
must give you notice of this before they start. The law on lay-off and short-
time does not set out any minimum period of notice you must get.
