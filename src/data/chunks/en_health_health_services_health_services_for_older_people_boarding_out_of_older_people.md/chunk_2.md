##  What is boarding out?

If you are an older person and your home becomes unsuitable, or you are unable
or do not want to live on your own, you may consider moving into a private
homeowner's house.

This is called boarding out and is organised in communities by the [ Health
Service Executive ](/en/health/health-system/health-service-executive/) (HSE).

The householder is the person who owns the home. They will be responsible for
giving you the care you need as well as meals that are nutritious and varied.

The boarding out scheme is not available in all areas. A maximum of 6 people
can be boarded out in one house.
