##  Savings and investments assessment

Any savings and investments you have are also reviewed by the HSE in the means
test for a [ medical card ](/en/health/medical-cards-and-gp-visit-
cards/medical-card/) or [ GP visit card ](/en/health/medical-cards-and-gp-
visit-cards/gp-visit-cards/) .

Savings, investments or property up to €36,000 for a single person, or €72,000
for a couple, are disregarded.

Interest on savings or investments over the limit is taken into account in the
means test.

This means only the interest or income earned on your savings and investments
will be counted as income, not the total value of the savings or investments
themselves.
