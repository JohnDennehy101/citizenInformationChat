###  **When does the HSE review my finances?**

When you apply online, the HSE does a quick review of your finances to check
if you might qualify for a [ medical card ](/en/health/medical-cards-and-gp-
visit-cards/medical-card/) or [ GP visit card ](/en/health/medical-cards-and-
gp-visit-cards/gp-visit-cards/) . It does a full review of your finances later
in the application process when you send them [ documents to prove your
financial situation ](https://www2.hse.ie/services/schemes-allowances/medical-
cards/applying/documents-you-need/) , for example, payslips.
