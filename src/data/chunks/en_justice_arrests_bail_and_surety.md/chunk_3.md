###  Sureties or bails-persons

The court may not be satisfied with your promise to appear in court. It may
decide that it needs an independent surety to guarantee your appearance. An
independent surety is a person who makes themselves responsible for you coming
to court. They promise to pay a sum of money to the court if you do not appear
as agreed.
