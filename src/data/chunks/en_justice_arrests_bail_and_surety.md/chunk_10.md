###  Refusal of bail

If an application for bail is made by someone charged with a serious offence,
the court can refuse the application. The grounds for refusal are set out in [
Section 2 of the Bail Act, 1997
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1997/en/act/pub/0016/sec0002.html#zza16y1997s2)
. The court can refuse the application if it is considered necessary in order
to prevent the person from committing a serious offence while they are on
bail. The court takes the following items into account when deciding whether
to refuse bail:

  * Evidence or submissions about the nature and seriousness of the crime 
  * The severity of the punishment for the offence 
  * The strength of the case against the accused 
  * The prospect of a reasonably speedy trial 
  * The opposition of the Attorney General 
  * The accusedâ€™s previous convictions, if any, including convictions that are the subject of an appeal (these are convictions which have not been determined or withdrawn) 
  * Any other offences that the accused person is charged with and is awaiting trial for
