####  Station bail

When you are arrested and brought to a Garda station, the Garda in charge of
the station may decide to release you on station bail, with or without
sureties. They will decide the amount of money specified in the bail bond. You
must enter into a bond to appear before the District Court on a specific date.
They cannot release you on bail if there is a court warrant for your
detention.
