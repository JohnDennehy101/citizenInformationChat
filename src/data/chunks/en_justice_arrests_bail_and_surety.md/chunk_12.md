##  What happens if I do not appear in court?

If you do not appear in court as agreed, a bench warrant will be issued for
your arrest. This means that the Garda√≠ have been ordered to arrest you and
bring you before the court. You will lose the money that you or your
independent surety agreed to pay in the bail bond.

Breaking the bail bond is a criminal offence. This offence carries a maximum
penalty of a [ Class A fine ](/en/justice/criminal-law/criminal-trial/fines-
for-criminal-offences/) and/or 12 months imprisonment. Once you have broken
your bail bond once you will not be granted bail again in the future.

If you have reasonable cause for missing your court date you can present this
to the court. Possible reasons might include an illness, family emergency or a
family death. It is up to the court whether they accept your excuse.
