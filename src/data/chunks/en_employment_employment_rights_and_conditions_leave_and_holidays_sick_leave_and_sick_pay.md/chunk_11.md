###  **How is normal daily pay calculated for part-time workers?**

If you work part-time, your normal daily pay is based on your work pattern.

If you work:

(a) A **set amount of hours** (for example, you work 4 hours every work day)
**at a fixed rate** , then you get either €110 or 70% of your normal daily pay
– whichever is lower

(b) **Variable hours** **at a fixed rate** , then you get either €110 or 70%
of what you would have earned on the day you were sick – whichever is lower

If your work pattern does not fit into category (a) or (b) above, then you get
the lower amount of either €110 or your **average hourly rate** . To get your
average hourly rate you:

  * Divide your total pay over the past 13 weeks by your hours worked 
  * Multiply this by the hours you were scheduled to work on the day you were sick
