####  You work full-time

If you work full-time and you are on sick leave during a [ public holiday
](/en/employment/employment-rights-and-conditions/employment-rights-and-
duties/employee-rights-and-entitlements/) , you can get sick pay or Illness
Benefit for the public holiday you miss.

Or your employer can treat you as not being on sick leave on the public
holiday and pay you as normal for that day. In this case, they will not count
the public holiday as a sick leave day.
