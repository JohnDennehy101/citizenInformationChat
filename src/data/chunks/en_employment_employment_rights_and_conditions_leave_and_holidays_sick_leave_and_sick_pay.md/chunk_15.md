##  How does sick leave affect illness benefit?

If you are off work sick for more than 5 days, and you have enough PRSI
contributions, you can apply to the Department of Social Protection (DSP) for
a payment called [ Illness Benefit
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/social-welfare-
payments/disability-and-illness/disability-benefit/) .

Your Illness Benefit starts from day 6.
