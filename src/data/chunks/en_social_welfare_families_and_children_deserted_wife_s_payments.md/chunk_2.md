##  Introduction

Deserted Wife's Benefit and [ Deserted Wife’s Allowance ](/en/social-
welfare/families-and-children/deserted-wifes-allowance/) are two social
welfare payments made to women who were deserted by their husbands. Both of
these payments were closed to new applications in January 1997, when the [
One-Parent Family Payment ](/en/social-welfare/families-and-children/one-
parent-family-payment/) was introduced.

Some women have continued to get Deserted Wife’s Benefit because they
qualified for the payment before 2 January 1997 and have continued to meet the
qualifying criteria.
