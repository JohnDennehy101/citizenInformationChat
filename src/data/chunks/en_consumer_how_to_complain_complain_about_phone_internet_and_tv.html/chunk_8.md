###  **ComReg investigation**

Once ComReg receives your complaint, it will review the issue. It will

  * Tell you of the service provider’s obligations and your rights 
  * Escalate your complaint on your behalf to the service provider 
  * Give you a realistic idea of the likely outcome 

If ComReg refers your complaint to your service provider, the service provider
will contact you directly to resolve the complaint.

ComReg will monitor your complaint and follow up with the service provider if
they don’t contact you.

When the complaint has been resolved, the service provider will send a
response to you and to ComReg. ComReg will examine the final response to make
sure all your issues have been dealt with.
