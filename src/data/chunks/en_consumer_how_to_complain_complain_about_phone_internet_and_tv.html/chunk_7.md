###  **ComReg’s complaint handling service**

ComReg can only help with your complaint after you have gone through the
normal complaints handling process with your service provider.

There are time limits on when you can make a complaint to ComReg:

  * **Telecommunications issues:** complain within 9 months of your problem happening 
  * **Premium rate services:** complain within 3 months of your problem happening 

ComReg will need:

  * Your contact details 
  * The account name and account number (if applicable) 
  * Details of the complaint, including the complaint reference number 
  * Details of previous dealings with the service provider 
  * A clear statement of how you want the problem to be fixed 

Tell ComReg if there are any details you don’t want them to send to the
service provider.
