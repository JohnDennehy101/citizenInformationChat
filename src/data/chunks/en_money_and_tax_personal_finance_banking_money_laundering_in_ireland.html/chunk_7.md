###  What do I have to do if I am a designated person?

If you are a designated person, you must:

  * Carry out risk assessments for your business 
  * Apply _customer due diligence_ (for example, identify customers or beneficial owners) 
  * Report suspicious transactions to An Garda Síochána (the Financial Intelligence Unit) and the Revenue Commissioners 
  * Put in place specific procedures to prevent money laundering and terrorist financing 

Customer due diligence obligations are designed to make it more difficult for
businesses to be used by for criminal money laundering or terrorist financing.
