##  Introduction

When you buy goods, services or digital content or services, you have rights
and protections under Irish and EU consumer law. However, things can go wrong
after buying something and you may want to complain to the seller.

If you have a problem with a product or service, or you feel you were treated
unfairly or misled, you should:

  * Check that you have proof of purchase 
  * Always go back to the seller first 
  * Try to sort the problem with the seller as quickly as possible. A delay could affect the outcome you get (for example you might only be entitled to a repair instead of a refund) 

If you cannot resolve the problem directly, you can get help and advice from
consumer protection organisations (see ‘How to take my complaint further’
below’.) You also have other formal options to help resolve a dispute with the
seller, including the [ small claims procedure ](/en/justice/courts-
system/small-claims-court/) .

This page explains the steps to take to resolve your general consumer
complaints. See ‘More information’ below for help with complaints for specific
sectors or topics.
