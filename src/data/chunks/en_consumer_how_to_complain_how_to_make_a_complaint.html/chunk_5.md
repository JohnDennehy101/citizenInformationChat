###  Make sure you have a valid reason to complain

Before you complain, you need to check whether the seller is responsible for
fixing the problem.

You need to check that you have a _valid complaint_ . This means that there is
a law that gives you grounds to make a complaint.

It is not always straightforward to work out whether you have a valid reason
to complain and it depends on the facts of each case. But in general, you have
valid reason to complain if:

  * Something you bought doesn’t work 
  * A service is not provided in line with the contract you made with the trader 
  * Something has not been delivered on time 
  * You have been misled by the seller or an advert 

Some things may not be covered, for example:

  * You didn’t use a product in the way it was intended 
  * A product stopped working because of normal wear and tear 
  * You tried to repair it yourself 
  * There are superficial faults that you should have spotted when you bought the product 
  * You were told about a defect before you bought the item 
  * You did not install a digital update that was needed for the product to work properly (the seller must supply the required updates for the duration of the contract)
