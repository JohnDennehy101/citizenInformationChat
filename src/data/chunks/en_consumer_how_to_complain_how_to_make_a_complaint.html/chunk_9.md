###  Start with an informal approach

Talking face-to-face or over the phone can be a good first step in raising
your problem with the seller. Ask to speak to a supervisor or manager who can
sort out the problem for you (for example by repairing or replacing the good
or refunding your money).

In some cases, the seller might offer other ways of making an informal
complaint, for example through a customer care email, an online contact form,
or web chat. If you use web chat, take screenshots in case the company does
not keep a record of what was said.

Always keep notes of what happened, including dates and times of
conversations, the name of the person you spoke to, and what was agreed. Keep
previous correspondence (for example, email, web chat, and online contact
form) safe as you may need this if you want to take your complaint further.
