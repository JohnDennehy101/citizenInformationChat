###  Taking your complaint further

If you are not satisfied with the response, you can take your complaint to the
[ National Transport Authority (NTA) ](https://www.nationaltransport.ie/) .

If you cannot resolve your complaint or the bus company refuses to pay
compensation, you can consider court action. If your claim for compensation is
€2,000 or less, you use the [ small claims procedure ](/en/justice/courts-
system/small-claims-court/) .

For cross-border disputes within the EU for €5,000 or less, you can use the [
European small claims procedure ](/en/justice/courts-system/european-small-
claims-procedure/) .
