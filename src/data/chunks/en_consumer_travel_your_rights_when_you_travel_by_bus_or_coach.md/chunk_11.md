###  Care and assistance

If your service was due to last more than 3 hours and is delayed by more than
90 minutes, you have extra entitlements.

The bus company must offer you:

  * Accommodation if you have to stay overnight for up to 2 nights (to the maximum value of â‚¬80 a night) and transport to and from the accommodation
