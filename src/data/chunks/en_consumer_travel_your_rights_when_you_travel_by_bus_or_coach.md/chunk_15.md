###  Your right to assistance

Assistance means extra help because you have a disability or have reduced
mobility. You must tell the bus company what help you will need before you
travel. The bus company should then give the assistance free of charge.

If you will need help at a bus terminal and on board the coach, you must give
at least 36 hoursâ€™ notice before you plan to travel.

If you need someone to come with you to help you, they must be allowed to
travel for free. You must inform the bus company, before you travel, about
your specific requirements.

You can get a refund or re-routing if you have a ticket or a reservation, and:

  * You told the bus company about your specific needs 
  * You are not allowed to travel because of your disability or reduced mobility
