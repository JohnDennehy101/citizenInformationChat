##  What are my rights when travelling by bus or coach?

You have passenger rights when you travel on most buses or coaches in the EU.

These cover delays, cancellations, lost luggage and injury to passengers.

_Travel operators_ must:

  * Give you information about your rights and what help you are entitled to 
  * Treat you and other passengers fairly and equally 
  * Resolve issues caused by delays or cancellations 

Travel operators include transport companies (which run buses) and companies
that operate terminals such as bus stations.
