##  National Office for Suicide Prevention

The [ National Office for Suicide Prevention (NOSP)
](https://www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/4/mental-health-services/nosp/) was
established within the [ Health Service Executive (HSE) ](/en/health/health-
system/health-service-executive/) in 2005 to oversee the implementation of the
first [ National Strategy for Action on Suicide Prevention (pdf)
](https://www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/4/mental-health-
services/nosp/resources/reachoutsuicidepreventionstrategy.pdf) .

The NOSP supports the implementation of the current national strategy, [
Connecting for Life ](https://www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/4/mental-health-
services/nosp/preventionstrategy/) , and co-ordinates suicide prevention
efforts around the country.
