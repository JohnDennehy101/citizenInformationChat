relationships/separation-and-divorce/judicial-separation/)

If a couple cannot agree on the terms for living separately, they can apply to
the court for a **decree of judicial separation** . This is a legal document
confirming that you and your spouse are no longer obliged to live together as
a married couple. The court may also make orders in relation to other matters
such as custody and access to children

However, it is not necessary to do either before applying for a divorce.

When you apply for a decree of divorce, the court can review your existing
separation arrangements. This is review is important if your circumstances (or
your spouseâ€™s circumstances) have changed.
