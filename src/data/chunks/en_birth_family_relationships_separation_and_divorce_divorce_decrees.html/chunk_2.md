##  Introduction

To get a divorce in Ireland, you must meet certain conditions (see ‘  rules
for getting a divorce  ’).

If you meet these conditions, you can apply to a court for a decree of
divorce. This is a court order saying the marriage is dissolved (officially
over) and means that you are free to remarry. A decree of divorce cannot be
reversed, except in exceptional circumstances.

The court may also make orders (rulings) about:

  * [ Custody of children and access to them ](/en/birth-family-relationships/separation-and-divorce/separation-and-divorce-children/)
  * [ Maintenance ](/en/birth-family-relationships/separation-and-divorce/maintenance-orders-and-agreements/) payments and lump sums to be paid 
  * The transfer of property 
  * [ Pension ](/en/birth-family-relationships/separation-and-divorce/sep-divorce-pensions/) rights 
  * Other matters
