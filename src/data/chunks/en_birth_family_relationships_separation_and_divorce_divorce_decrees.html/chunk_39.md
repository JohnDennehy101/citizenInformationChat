##  Brexit and UK divorces

On [ 31 January 2020 at 11pm the UK exited the EU
](https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2020/01/30/brexit-
council-adopts-decision-to-conclude-the-withdrawal-agreement/) . From that
date the UK is no longer a member of the EU and is considered a third country.
During the agreed transition period (until 31 December 2020), British citizens
and their families had the same right to live, work, claim benefits, and
access healthcare in the EU as they had before. This includes the recognition
of British divorces in EU member states.

Since 11pm on 31 January 2020, the UK is no longer covered by EU laws relating
to matrimonial matters. However, the [ Withdrawal of the United Kingdom from
the European Union (Consequential Provisions) Act 2020 (pdf)
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2020/act/23/enacted/en/pdf) provides for
the continued recognition in Ireland of divorces, legal separations and
marriage annulments granted in the UK.
