###  1\. You must live apart

You and your spouse must live apart from one another for at least 2 out of the
previous 3 years before you can apply for divorce. Before 1 December 2019,
this was 4 out of the previous 5 years.

The [ Family Law Act 2019 (pdf)
](https://data.oireachtas.ie/ie/oireachtas/act/2019/37/eng/enacted/a3719.pdf)
clarifies that ‘living apart’ includes couples who live in the same home as
one another but are not living together as a couple in an intimate and
committed relationship.

The Act also says that a relationship does not stop being intimate just
because the relationship is no longer sexual in nature.
