##  How do I know if my child is being bullied?

Many children who are being bullied are afraid to speak out. They may be
worried that telling someone will make the bullying worse.

Reports have shown that as young people grow older, they are less likely to
tell someone. They become more and more isolated, experience depression and,
in extreme cases, can harm themselves or attempt suicide.
