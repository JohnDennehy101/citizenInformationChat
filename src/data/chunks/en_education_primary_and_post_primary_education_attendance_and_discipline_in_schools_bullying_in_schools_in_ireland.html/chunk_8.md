##  How is bullying stopped?

If a child is being bullied at school, adult intervention is usually needed.
Bullying must be challenged or it will become regular and get worse.

If you think your child is being bullied at school, you should first talk to
the class teacher or school principal.

School authorities are responsible for dealing with bullying. All schools
should have an anti-bullying policy as part of their overall code of
behaviour.
