##  Do I have a PPS number already?

If you are returning home to Ireland, you may already have a PPS number.

You already have a PPS number if you:

  * Were born in Ireland from 1971 onwards 
  * Started work in Ireland after April 1979 
  * Are getting an Irish social welfare payment 

If you already have a PPS number, you do not need to apply for a new one.
