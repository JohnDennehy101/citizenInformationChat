###  **Special school**

All special schools can provide a Summer Programme. The programme will take
place for a set number of weeks in the child’s school during the school summer
holidays.

For special schools, a Summer Programme National Coordinator works with the
school to facilitate the programme.

If your child’s school can’t offer your child a place, or it is not providing
a school-based Summer Programme, you can [ contact the Coordinator
](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/ea8fe-summer-prog-special-schools-
temps/#queries-and-support) (see ‘More information’ below). They can help you
find a place for your child in their own school, or at another location.

If your child cannot get a place on a school-based Summer Programme, they may
access the home-based programme (see ‘Home-based programme’ below).
