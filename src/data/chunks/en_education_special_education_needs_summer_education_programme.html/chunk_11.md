##  DEIS schools summer camp

DEIS primary schools may [ run literacy and numeracy camps
](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/ab25e-summer-provision-school-based-
programme-in-primary-schools/#deis-summer-camps) for children in addition to a
school-based Summer Programme.

Literacy and numeracy camps are for children who are considered by the school
to have the greatest level of need. Each camp is for 1 week and provides 4
hours of instruction each day. The summer camps also provide wellbeing and
school engagement programmes for children at risk of educational disadvantage.
The camps can be run through English or Gaeilge.

Primary schools can allocate places to children of any age, including sixth
class, and can choose children who would most benefit from the programme.
