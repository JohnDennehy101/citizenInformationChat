###  **Remaining places**

When the priority places have gone, the remaining places will be offered to
children considered most at risk of educational disadvantage.

For example, the remaining places may be offered to:

  * Children identified by the school as being most at risk of educational disadvantage and early school-leaving 
  * Children accessing Special Education Teacher (SET) or Special Needs Assistant (SNA) support 
  * Children from Traveller and Roma communities 
  * Children who have recently arrived from Ukraine and other countries who need support with English language or integration
