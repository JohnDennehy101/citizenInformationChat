###  Linking claims

If you claim Jobseeker's Benefit (JB) for a period, sign off and then claim JB
again within 26 weeks, your claim may be linked to the earlier claim. This
means that your claim is not treated as a new claim and:

  * You do not have to wait for 3 days before getting your payment 
  * The cumulative total of days from the previous claim is continued (so, for example, if you have used up 100 days of your total JB entitlement of 234 days you have 134 days remaining on your claim) 
  * The rate of JB is the same rate payable as on the previous claim, unless there has been a budget increase or change in family circumstances (such as a new child dependant). 

If your JB claim does not link to a previous claim, it is treated as a new
claim. You must wait for 3 days before getting a payment and your cumulative
total of days starts from the first day of payment.
