###  Jobseeker's Benefit and work

To get Jobseeker's Benefit, you must be unemployed, or have lost at least one
day's employment and as a result be unemployed for at least 4 days out of 7
days. You may continue to get Jobseeker's Benefit if you can only find part-
time or casual work.

If you’re getting Jobseeker's Benefit and you work part-time during the week,
your payment is based on a 5-day payment week. This means that for each day
you work, 1/5th of the normal rate of Jobseeker's Benefit is deducted. If you
work part-time for 2 days, you will get 3/5ths of the normal Jobseeker's
Benefit for that week, and if you work part-time for 3 days, you will get
2/5ths of the normal rate of Jobseeker’s Benefit for the week. You must still
be unemployed for at least 4 days out of 7 to claim Jobseeker's Benefit.

If you are getting JB, you can use the online [ Benefit of Work Ready Reckoner
](https://www.mywelfare.ie/benefitofworkjsestimator) from the DSP. It helps
you figure out how much money you would get if you took up full-time work,
including any Working Family Payment, and compares it to what you currently
get from Jobseeker's Benefit, including Rent Supplement.
