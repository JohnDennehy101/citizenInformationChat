###  If there is no VRC

If the VRC is not available, you can use a declaration of ownership form. To
do this, you must get a statutory declaration sworn before a commissioner for
oaths or a solicitor. The statutory declaration is a way of swearing that
something is true. It is a written statement and must be witnessed by someone
who is authorised to witness your declaration. The statutory declaration form
should go with the letter from the executor of the will or the solicitor.

You can get a statutory declaration form from your [ local motor tax office
](https://www.gov.ie/en/service/1fc151-find-your-local-motor-tax-office/) .
