##  If the seller won’t send the Vehicle Registration Certificate

If you are having problems and the seller won’t send the VRC to the Department
of Transport.

You as the buyer can do the following:

  * Contact the Department of Transport, you can email [ dvcsdchangeofownership@dttas.ie ](mailto:dvcsdchangeofownership@dttas.ie) , (include your postal address), and you will be given a statutory declaration form. 
  * Complete the declaration form and have it witnessed by a Commissioner for Oaths or a practicing solicitor. 
  * Send both completed documents back to the Department of Transport – see ‘Where to apply’ below. 

This does not apply if you bought the car from a motor dealer. The motor
dealer is responsible for following the procedures for change of vehicle
ownership notification.
