##  Changing address details

If your address has changed, tick the change of address option on the reverse
side of your Vehicle Registration Certificate (VRC). Fill in your new address
details and post it to the Department of Transport. An updated VRC will be
posted back to you. You can change your address online, but only as part of an
online [ motor tax ](/en/travel-and-recreation/motoring/motor-tax-and-
insurance/motor-tax-rates/) transaction. You cannot change your address by
email or over the phone.
