##  If you sell a vehicle privately

There are 4 steps in a private sale for changing vehicle ownership. It is your
responsibility as the seller to ensure it is done correctly.

  1. Complete and sign the change of ownership section on the back of the Vehicle Registration Certificate (VRC). 
  2. The buyer must sign the same form. 
  3. Send the completed form to the Department of Transport for updating (see ‘Where to apply’). 
  4. The Department of Transport will post the VRC to the new owner.
