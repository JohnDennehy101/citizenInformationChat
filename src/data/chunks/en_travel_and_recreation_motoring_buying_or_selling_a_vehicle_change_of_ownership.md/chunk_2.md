##  Introduction

If you sell your vehicle or trade it in for a new model, you must legally
register the change of ownership. You register free of charge with the
Department of Transport. The Department of Transport keep a record of vehicles
called the national vehicle and driver file (NVDF).

Ownership and address details must be kept up to date at all times. This is
important because, for example, if your vehicle is subject to a safety recall,
manufacturers will contact all registered owners using their record. Upon
receipt it takes approximately 2 to 5 days to process a Vehicle Registration
Certificate.

This page tells you how to change a vehicles ownership detail on a Vehicle
Registration Certificate (VRC, also known as the logbook).
