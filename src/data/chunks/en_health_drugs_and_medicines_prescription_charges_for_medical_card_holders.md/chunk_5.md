###  Medical card holders who do not pay the prescription charge

Certain people and certain products are not liable for the prescription
charge:

  * People who qualify for the [ Long Term Illness Scheme ](/en/health/drugs-and-medicines/long-term-illness-scheme/) are entitled to get the drugs and medicines for the treatment of that illness free of charge. 
  * People who have [ a Health Amendment Act Card ](/en/health/health-services/blood-and-organ-donation/hepatitis-c-and-health-amendment-act-cards/) are entitled to get approved prescribed drugs and medicines free of charge. 
  * Children in the care of the HSE who have their own medical card. This includes children in residential care, foster care, foster care with relatives and other care placements. 
  * Asylum seekers living in direct provision accommodation. 
  * There is no charge for methadone supplied to patients participating in the Methadone Treatment Scheme. 
  * High Tech products and medicines, usually only prescribed in hospitals, for example anti-rejection drugs for transplant patients or medicines used in conjunction with chemotherapy. As the supply of High Tech Medicines operates on the basis of a patient care fee, a prescription charge does not apply.
