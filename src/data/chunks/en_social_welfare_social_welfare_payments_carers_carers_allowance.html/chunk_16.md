###  **Capital**

Capital includes your savings, investments, shares, and any property you have
(but not your own home). The first €50,000 of your capital does not affect
your Carer’s Allowance payment. If you are a couple, your combined capital is
divided by 2 and the €50,000 disregard is applied to this amount.
