##  Interim scheme to fix fire safety issues

On 11 December 2023, [ an Interim Remediation Scheme was launched
](https://www.gov.ie/en/press-release/d252a-government-launches-the-interim-
remediation-scheme-for-fire-safety-defects-in-apartments-and-duplexes/) . The
interim scheme funds work to fix emergency fire safety issues in apartments
and duplexes that were built between 1991 and 2013. It aims to ensure that
there is an acceptable standard of fire safety in buildings before more
comprehensive works are completed under the main scheme.

The Interim Remediation Scheme is administered by the Housing Agency. Your [
owners' management company
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/housing/owning-a-home/home-
owners/management-companies-for-apartment-blocks/#63e738) applies to the
Housing Agency for funding by completing the online [ application form
](https://survey.zohopublic.eu/zs/tTBj2w) . If the application qualifies for
the interim scheme, the Housing Agency will email information to the OMC
outlining the next steps. This should happen within 7 to 10 working days of
the application. The Housing Agency has [ more information about the interim
scheme including details of what work is covered by the scheme
