###  **Who will get the funding under the planned scheme?**

Ownersâ€™ management companies (OMCs) will receive funding to carry out the
remediation work (repair work). The whole building will be considered at the
same time for remediation work. This means common areas and individual
apartments will be assessed together. The amount of funding provided will
depend on the defects to be fixed.
