###  What properties will qualify for the planned scheme?

Apartments and duplexes built between 1991 and 2013 will qualify for the
scheme. The scheme will cover work to fix:

  * Fire safety defects 
  * Structural safety defects 
  * Defects caused by water getting into a property 

The scheme only applies if the defects were caused by defective design,
workmanship or materials that breached the [ Building Regulations
](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/1d2af-building-regulations/) which applied
when the property was built.

The scheme will not cover defects that came about because:

  * The building was not adequately maintained 
  * Sinking funds did not plan funding to replace building and safety systems when they expired 
  * Later building work was not managed correctly and this led to defects
