###  **The rights of children**

Article 42A was added to the Constitution in 2015. It affirms children’s
natural and imprescriptible rights and the State’s duty to uphold these
rights. Children have the right for their best interests to be of paramount
consideration where the State seeks to intervene to protect their safety and
welfare.

This right applies in all court proceedings concerning adoption, guardianship,
custody, and access. In these proceedings, children also have the right to
have their views ascertained and considered by the courts. The courts are to
have regard to a child’s age and maturity when considering their views in
accordance with this right.
