###  The right to earn a livelihood

As a citizen, you have a right to work and to earn a living, whether you are
male or female. However, that general right doesnâ€™t mean that you can insist
on being employed in a particular role or area or by a particular employer.

The State has a general duty to protect your right to work and earn a
livelihood from unjust attack.
