###  Right to life

The Constitution specifically recognises and protects your right to life
(Article 40.3).

Your right to life also means the right to have nature take its course and to
die a natural death. That does not mean that you have the right to have your
life terminated or death unnaturally accelerated.

In May 2018, the people voted in a referendum to allow the Oireachtas to pass
laws regulating the termination of pregnancy. The [ Health (Regulation of
Termination of Pregnancy) Act 2018
](https://www.oireachtas.ie/en/bills/bill/2018/105/) was signed into law on 20
December 2018.
