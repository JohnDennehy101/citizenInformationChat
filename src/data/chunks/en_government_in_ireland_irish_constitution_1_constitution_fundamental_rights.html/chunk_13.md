###  **The right to privacy**

The Constitution does not specifically state a right to privacy but the courts
recognise that the personal rights in the Constitution imply the right to
privacy. It has sometimes been described as the right “to be let alone” in
private settings.

For example, your private written communications and telephone conversations
cannot be deliberately, consciously and unjustifiably interfered with. Your
rights to cast a secret ballot in elections and to the confidentiality of
medical details are other examples of the right to privacy in action.

However, your right to privacy may be limited or restricted by legislation in
the interests of the common good, public order and morality.
