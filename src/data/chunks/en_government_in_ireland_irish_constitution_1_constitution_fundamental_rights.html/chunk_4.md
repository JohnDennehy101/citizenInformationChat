###  Equality before the law

All citizens shall be held equal before the law (Article 40.1 of the
Constitution). This means that the State cannot unjustly, unreasonably or
arbitrarily discriminate between citizens. You cannot be treated as inferior
or superior to any other person in society simply because of your human
attributes or your ethnic, racial, social or religious background.

However, when the State is making laws, it may consider differences of
capacity and of social function between individuals in society.
