###  Freedom of expression

You have a right to freely express your convictions and opinions (Article
40.6.1.i). However, that right can be limited in the interests of public order
and morality. You can also not use this right to [ defame ](/en/justice/civil-
law/law-on-defamation/) someone else as this would interfere their
constitutional right to a good name.

The Constitution also states that it is an offence to publish or utter
seditious (material undermining the authority of the State or advocating for
the overthrow of the State) or indecent material.

Following a referendum in May 2018, the [ Thirty-seventh Amendment of the
Constitution (Repeal of offence of publication or utterance of blasphemous
matter) Act 2018 ](https://www.oireachtas.ie/en/bills/bill/2018/87/) was
passed. Blasphemy is no longer a constitutional offence.

The State is also obliged by the Constitution to make sure that media such as
the radio, the press and the cinema are not used to undermine public order or
morality or the authority of the State. For example, the [ Censorship
](/en/government-in-ireland/irish-constitution-1/censorship/) of Publications
Acts and the Censorship of Films Acts allow [ censorship ](/en/government-in-
ireland/irish-constitution-1/censorship/) of publications like books, films
and DVDs.
