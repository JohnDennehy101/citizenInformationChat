##  Religious freedom

[ Article 44 ](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/cons/en/html#article44) of
the Constitution deals with religion.

You are free to practise your religion and your freedom of conscience. The
State guarantees not to endow or favour any religion and not to discriminate
on the grounds of religion.

State aid for schools cannot discriminate between schools of different
religious denominations. Every child has the right to attend a denominational
school receiving State funding without having to participate in religious
instruction in the school.

Your right to religious liberty may be limited to protect public order and
morality.
