##  What companies can use the WSS?

The Scheme is available to **private sector** employers who can employ workers
with a disability between 15 and 39 hours per week.

The minimum weekly hours threshold for eligibility was reduced from 21 to 15
hours from 1 April 2024.

An employer can offer more than 39 hours each week, but they can only claim a
subsidy for up to 39 hours.

The contract of employment offered must be for a minimum of 6 months.

Subsidy Scheme ](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/789802-operational-
