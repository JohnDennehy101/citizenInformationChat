##  Example 2: Sally is not paid any top-up by her employer while she is on
maternity leave. Her Maternity Benefit is paid directly to her while she is on
leave.

Sally is not paid by her employer while on maternity leave so the following
applies. Sally earned €710 per week (€36,920 a year). She paid tax, PRSI and
Universal Social Charge weekly. Her tax and Universal Social Charge were
deducted on the assumption that she would continue to earn the same amount for
the rest of the year.

When she goes on maternity leave and starts getting Maternity Benefit, she is
no longer liable to pay the Universal Social Charge or PRSI (since these are
not charged on Maternity Benefit). She may get a refund of Universal Social
Charge. When she returns to work, she will probably also get a refund of tax
because, while she is on maternity leave, her tax credits are more than the
tax due on her Maternity Benefit and she may also have paid extra tax on her
salary before going on maternity leave.
