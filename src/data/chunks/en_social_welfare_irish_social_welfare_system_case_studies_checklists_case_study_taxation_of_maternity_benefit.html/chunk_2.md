##  Introduction

**This case study shows how tax credits and bands are adjusted by Revenue to
account for Maternity Benefit. Note that these examples do not refer to people
who are jointly assessed with their spouse or civil partner.**

Employees are entitled to a personal tax credit (€1,875 in 2024) and an
Employee Tax Credit (€1,875 in 2024). Their standard rate cut-off point is the
amount of their personal standard rate tax band. For each pay period, they pay
tax at the standard rate of tax (20%) up to their standard rate cut-off point.
Any income over the standard rate cut-off point is taxed at the higher rate of
40%. When the total amount of tax has been calculated, their tax credits are
subtracted from this figure to give the total amount of tax owed.

When you go on maternity leave you may qualify for 26 weeks of Maternity
Benefit. The standard rate of Maternity Benefit is €274 each week so if you
qualify for the standard payment, you will be paid €7,124 of Maternity Benefit
in total. Revenue will reduce your tax credits and weekly standard rate cut-
off point to account for the tax payable on your Maternity Benefit.

The tax due on the weekly Maternity Benefit (€274 x 20% = €54.80) will be
deducted from your weekly tax credits and the total amount of Maternity
Benefit will be deducted from your weekly cut-off point. If you do not have
your Maternity Benefit topped up by your employer, a refund of tax may arise
which can be calculated when you return to work (see Example 2 below).

**Revised tax credit and weekly cut off point calculations** Single Person’s Tax Credit  |  €1,875 annually   
---|---  
Employee (PAYE) Tax Credit  |  €1,875 annually   
Weekly Tax Credit  |  €72.12   
Maternity Benefit deduction (20% of payment)  |  less €54.80   
**Revised tax credit** |  **€17.32**  
Standard weekly cut off point (income taxed at 20%)  |  €807.69 (€42,000 annually)   
**Revised weekly cut off point (standard cut off point minus Maternity Benefit at €274)** |  **€533.69**
