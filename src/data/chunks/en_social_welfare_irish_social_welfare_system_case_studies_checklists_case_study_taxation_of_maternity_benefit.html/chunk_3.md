##  Example 1: Ann is paid her full salary whileon maternity leave

Ann is on maternity leave. She receives a gross salary of €550 per week and
Maternity Benefit of €274 per week is paid directly by the Department of
Social Protection (DSP) to Ann’s employer.

Revenue will receive the Maternity Benefit details directly from the DSP,
reduce Ann’s annual tax credits and rate band by the Maternity Benefit amount
(see above for how this is done), and send a revised tax credit certificate to
her employer. Ann’s revised weekly rate band will be €533.69 and her weekly
tax credits will be €17.32.

Ann’s weekly salary while she is on maternity leave is made up of:

**Maternity Benefit:** €274

**Company Salary:** €550

**Total:** €824

The company salary portion (€550) has tax, USC and PRSI deducted by the
employer. The tax payable on the Maternity Benefit portion (€274) is collected
by the reduction in Ann’s tax credits and rate band. Maternity Benefit is not
chargeable to USC or PRSI.
