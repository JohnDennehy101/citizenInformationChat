##  Employment and disability payments

**Social assistance (means-tested) payments** : [ Disability Allowance
](/en/social-welfare/disability-and-illness/disability-allowance/) and [ Blind
Pension ](/en/social-welfare/disability-and-illness/blind-persons-pension/)
are means-tested disability payments. If you start work, you must notify the
DSP and provide proof of your earnings (a pay slip, your contract of
employment or a letter from your employer). You do not need to have been
getting your payment for a minimum period of time before you can take up work.
You may keep your Disability Allowance or Blind Pension if your income is
below a certain level.

If you leave your new job, you should contact the DSP and your Disability
Allowance will be quickly re-instated at the appropriate rate.
