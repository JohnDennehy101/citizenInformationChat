##  How to qualify for an Additional Needs Payment

To qualify for an Additional Needs Payment, you must:

  * Live in Ireland, and 
  * Have an income below the 'weekly household income' limit – see below 

When you apply for an Additional Needs Payment, your application will be
assessed by a Community Welfare Officer (CWO).

The CWO will look at your circumstances and decide if you qualify for the
payment.

In some cases, the CWO can provide a payment if your income is above the
weekly household income limit, but it will depend on your circumstances.
