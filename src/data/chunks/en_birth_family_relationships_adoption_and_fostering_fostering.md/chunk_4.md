##  The role of Tusla

[ Tusla, the Child and Family Agency ](/en/birth-family-
relationships/services-and-supports-for-children/tusla-the-child-and-family-
agency/) , assesses, recruits and trains foster families according to the
needs of the area. Tusla also places children with foster families who have
been recruited and trained by non-statutory agencies. Tusla is a non-statutory
agency responsible for each child in care. Tusla may also provide support to
the foster family.

Each foster child has their own social worker who monitors the growth and
development of the child, and ensures that the best interests of the child are
always the priority. Each foster family also has its own social worker, who
may have helped assess the family as suitable to foster children and who will
support the family throughout the foster term. An important part of the social
worker's role is to develop the relationship between the foster child and the
foster family and between the foster child and their own family.

Fostering a child differs from adoption because a child in foster care always
remains a permanent part of their own family. Tusla is responsible for the
child and the foster parents do not have [ guardianship ](/en/birth-family-
relationships/cohabiting-couples/guardianship-and-cohabiting-couples/) .
