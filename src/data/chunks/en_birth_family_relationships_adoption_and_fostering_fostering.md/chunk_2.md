##  What is fostering?

Fostering means taking care of someone else's child in your own home.
Sometimes a child cannot live with their own family, either on a short-term or
long-term basis. This could be because of illness in the family, the death of
a parent, neglect, abuse or violence in the home. Sometimes it can be because
the parent or family is not coping. It is always the goal that a child placed
in foster care will return to their own family as soon as they can, if
possible. Young people up to the age of 18 can be fostered.

Foster care in Ireland is governed by the [ Child Care Act 1991
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1991/en/act/pub/0017/index.html) and the [
Child Care (Placement of Children in Foster Care) Regulations 1995, as amended
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1995/en/si/0260.html) . In addition, the [
National Standards for Foster Care, 2003 (pdf) ](http://health.gov.ie/wp-
content/uploads/2014/03/natstan1.pdf) ensure that foster care placements are
adequately supported and that children in foster care are receiving the best
possible care.

In June 2022, 89% of children and young people in the care of the State were
living with foster carers. Of the 5,219 children in foster care, 61.9% (3,230)
were in general foster care, 28.8% (1,504) were in relative foster care while
the remaining 9.3% (485) were placed with non-statutory fostering agencies
(private).
