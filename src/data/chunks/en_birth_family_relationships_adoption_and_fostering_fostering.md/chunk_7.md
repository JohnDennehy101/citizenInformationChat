###  Relative foster care

Relative foster care is when a person such as a family member, family friend
or neighbour becomes the foster parent of the child. Normally, a relative
foster carer is a person with whom the child or the child’s family has had a
relationship prior to the child’s admission to care. A relative foster carer
is assessed by Tusla in the same way as all other foster parents.

In making a decision about a relative becoming foster parent to the child,
Tusla will consider what is in the best interest of the child. Assessment will
also take into account the needs of the child and the abilities and
suitability of the relative foster carer to be a foster parent.

At the end of June 2022, nearly 29% of children in care were living with a
relative foster carer.
