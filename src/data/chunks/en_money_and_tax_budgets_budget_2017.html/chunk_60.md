####  Charities and VAT

Charities are exempt from VAT under the EU VAT Directive and as a result
cannot recover VAT incurred on goods and services that they purchase.

The Department of Finance plans to engage again with the Irish Charities Tax
Reform Group to review options for how charities might be compensated in
relation to VAT.
