In 2017, an additional €36.5 million will provide for over 179,000 full-time
enrolments.

€8.5 million will help more disadvantaged students, including lone parents and
Travellers, to attend higher level. This includes €4 million to introduce full
maintenance grants from September 2017 for the most disadvantaged postgraduate
students.

Funding will be allocated to provide for increased demand for traditional
apprenticeships and the rollout of apprenticeships in new sectors.
