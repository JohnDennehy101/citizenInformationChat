###  Agri Measures

The Farmer’s Flat-Rate Addition will increase from 5.2% to 5.4% with effect
from 1 January 2017. Farmers not registered for VAT add a Flat-Rate percentage
to their sales of produce and agricultural services to VAT registered
customers who are entitled to reclaim such VAT in their VAT returns. The flat-
rate scheme compensates the farmers for VAT incurred on their farming inputs.

The scheme of accelerated capital allowances for energy efficient equipment is
being made available to sole traders and non-corporates.

The **Income Averaging regime** allows a farmer’s taxable profit to be
averaged out over a 5-year period. This is being amended to allow an “opt out”
in a single year of unexpectedly poor income, and, instead, pay only the tax
due on a current year basis with any deferred tax liability becoming payable
over subsequent years. This may be availed of for the 2016 tax year.

**Farm restructuring CGT relief** is available where the first transaction in
the restructuring (e.g. sale, purchase or exchange of land) is carried out by
31 December 2016 with the restructuring to be completed within 24 months. The
deadline for the completion of the first restructuring transaction is being
extended to 31 December 2019.
