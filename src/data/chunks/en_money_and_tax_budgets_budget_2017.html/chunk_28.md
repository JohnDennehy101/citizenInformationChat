####  Acquisition and renewal

The Housing Agency is being allocated a €70m **Rotating Fund** to acquire
properties for social housing. The Fund is expected to deliver 1,600 units by
2020.

€6 million is being allocated in 2017 for a **Repair and Leasing Initiative**
. Under this new initiative, local authorities will give financial assistance
to owners of vacant properties to bring them up to standard, so that they can
be leased for social housing. It is expected that this new initiative will
deliver 150 units in 2017.

Under a new **Buy and Renew initiative** , local authorities and approved
housing bodies will be supported to buy private housing units in need of
remediation, renew them and make them available for social housing use. €25
million is being provided for this initiative in 2017.
