##  Can I get parental leave?

You must meet certain criteria to be eligible for parental leave. You must:

  * Be a _relevant parent._ This means you are either a parent, an adoptive parent, or a person acting in ‘loco parentis’ (acting as a parent to the child) 
  * Take the leave before your child’s 12th birthday (or 16th birthday if your child has a disability or long-term illness) 
  * Give at least 6 weeks’ notice to your employer 
  * Take the leave in either one continuous period, or in blocks of at least 6 weeks (unless your employer agrees to let you take the leave differently – see ‘Do I have to take all my parental leave at the same time?’ below) 

The legislation only sets out the **minimum** entitlement to parental leave.
Depending on your contract of employment, you may have more extensive rights
to parental leave.
