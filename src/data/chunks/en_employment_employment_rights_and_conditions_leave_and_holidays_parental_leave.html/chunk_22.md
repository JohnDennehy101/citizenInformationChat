##  How to apply for parental leave

If you plan to take parental leave, you must give **written notice** to your
employer at least **6 weeks** before the leave is due to start.

Your written notice should include:

  * The date you plan to start parental leave 
  * The way in which the leave will be taken (for example, in one continuous block of 26 weeks or 1 day off a week) 
  * The duration of the leave 

You must sign a confirmation document with your employer, confirming the
details of your parental leave, **at least 4 weeks** before the leave is due
to start.

Employers should write to the Client Eligibility Services section of
Department of Social Protection (DSP), confirming the duration, number of
weeks and exact dates of parental leave.
