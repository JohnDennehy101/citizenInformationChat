###  What happens to my social insurance contributions?

You can get [ credited PRSI contributions ](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-
welfare-system/social-insurance-prsi/credited-social-insurance-contributions/)
while you are taking parental leave. Credited PRSI contributions can protect
your social insurance record and your entitlement to benefits in the future.

Your employer must write to [ the Client Eligibility Services section
](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/99f84f-operational-guidelines-prsi-
credited-social-insurance-contributions/#administration) of Department of
Social Protection (DSP), setting out the weeks you have not worked, so that
you can get credited PRSI contributions for this time.
