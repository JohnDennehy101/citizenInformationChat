###  What if I work part-time?

If you work part-time, your entitlement to parental leave is reduced on a
‘pro-rata basis’.

This means that, if you work 50% of a normal working week, you can take 13
full working weeks’ worth of parental leave.

In some cases, you and your employer will need to calculate what your normal
working week is, based on the number of hours worked in the previous 26 weeks.
