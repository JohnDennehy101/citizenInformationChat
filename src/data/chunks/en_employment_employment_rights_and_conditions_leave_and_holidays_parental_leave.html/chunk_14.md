###  What happens if I become sick while on parental leave?

If you get sick while on parental leave and are unable to care for your child,
the leave can be suspended for the duration of the illness.

You must give written notice and evidence of your illness to your employer as
soon as is reasonably practicable.

The parental leave resumes after the illness. During the illness, you are [
treated as an employee who is sick ](/en/employment/employment-rights-and-
conditions/leave-and-holidays/sick-leave-and-sick-pay/) .
