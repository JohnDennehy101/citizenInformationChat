##  What is parental leave?

Parental leave lets parents take unpaid leave from work to spend time looking
after their children. You can take up to 26 weeks’ parental leave for each
eligible child before their 12th birthday.

Generally, you must have been working for your employer for a year before you
are entitled to parental leave.
