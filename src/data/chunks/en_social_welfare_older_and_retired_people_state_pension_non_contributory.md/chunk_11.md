####  **Selling your home**

If you sell your home, the proceeds of the sale are normally taken into
account in the means test.

However, if you live in accommodation which no longer suits you, or which you
are no longer able to maintain, you may choose to sell your home and move to
more suitable accommodation. In this case, up to €190,500 of the sale proceeds
is exempt from the means test.

You must be selling your house to:

  * Buy or rent more suitable alternative accommodation 
  * Move into a registered nursing home or sheltered housing 
  * Move in with a person who is getting a carer’s payment for you 

If you use the proceeds of the sale to buy more suitable accommodation, the
balance of the proceeds **after** buying the new accommodation is exempt up to
a limit of €190,500.
