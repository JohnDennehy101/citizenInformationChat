###  **Income from your home (such as rent)**

The value of the house you live in is not taken into account in the means
test.

However, if you get income from your home (for example, from renting a room),
this may be taken into account. There are some exceptions:

  * Your income from rent is not taken into account if you would otherwise be living alone 
  * You can get up to [ €269.23 a week (€14,000 per year) from renting a room in your home ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/means-test-for-social-welfare-payments/means-test/) without it affecting your State (Non-Contributory) Pension. The person renting a room in your home must use the room for at least 28 consecutive days, and they cannot be your employee or an immediate family member. 

You should check if [ renting a room in your home will affect your Fuel
Allowance ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/extra-social-
welfare-benefits/fuel-
allowance/#b05c78:~:text=is%20not%20rented.-,Renting%20a%20room%20in%20your%20home,-If%20you%20are)
.

The [ Accommodation Recognition Payment
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/moving-country/ukrainian-refugees-in-
ireland/accommodation-recognition-payment/) for hosting refugees from Ukraine
is not assessed in the means test for the State (Non-Contributory) Pension.
