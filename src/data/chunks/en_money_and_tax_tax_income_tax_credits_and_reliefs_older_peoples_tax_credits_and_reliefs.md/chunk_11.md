##  Nursing home costs

You can claim tax relief on the cost of a nursing home with 24-hour on-site
nursing care, which you pay for yourself or for someone else.

This relief applies at the highest rate of income tax you pay. The higher rate
of income tax is 40% and applies to any income that is above the [ standard
rate cut-off point ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/money-and-
tax/tax/income-tax/how-your-tax-is-calculated/#d43041) . The standard rate of
20% applies to income below the cut-off point.

The nursing home expenses you pay are deducted from your total income. This
reduces the amount of your income that is taxable at the higher rate, if any,
before reducing the amount taxed at the standard rate. Revenue provides
examples of [ tax relief on nursing home expenses

exemptions/health-and-age/health-expenses/nursing-home-and-additional-nursing-
care-expenses.aspx) .

If you have a loan under the [ Fair Deal Nursing Home Loan
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/health/health-services/health-
services-for-older-people/fair-deal-scheme/#5ed1d3) , you or your estate can
claim tax relief when the loan is repaid. This is usually when you sell the
asset that was used as security or after your death.
