###  **Dependent Relative Tax Credit**

If you maintain a dependent relative, you may qualify for the Dependent
Relative Tax Credit. Maintaining a relative means meeting the costs of
everyday living.

The relative you claim for must be related to you, or to your spouse or civil
partner, and be a:

  * Parent who is widowed or is a surviving civil partner 
  * Son or daughter who lives with you and who you depend on because of your ill health or old age 
  * Relative who cannot maintain themselves due to age or illness 

To qualify for the tax credit, the income of your relative must be below a
limit.
