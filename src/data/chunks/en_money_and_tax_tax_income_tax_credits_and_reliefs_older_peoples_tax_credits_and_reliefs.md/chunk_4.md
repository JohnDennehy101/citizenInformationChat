####  Marginal relief for income above the exemption limit

If your income is above the exemption limit, but is less than twice the
exemption limit, you can get marginal relief. Under marginal relief, you are
only taxed on the amount over the exemption limit. However, that amount is
taxed at 40% and you get no tax credits.

Marginal relief will only apply if it benefits you more than the usual [
method of calculating tax ](/en/money-and-tax/tax/income-tax/how-your-tax-is-
calculated/) .

[ You can find more information about income tax exemptions and marginal
relief on Revenue's website ](https://www.revenue.ie/en/personal-tax-credits-
