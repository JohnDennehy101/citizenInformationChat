##  Tax credits

Tax credits reduce the amount of tax that you must pay. After [ calculating
your tax ](/en/money-and-tax/tax/income-tax/how-your-tax-is-calculated/) , the
amount of your tax credits is deducted from the amount of tax you owe.

Everyone is entitled to a personal tax credit. There are personal tax credits
for:

  * Single people 
  * People who are married or in a civil partnership 
  * People who are widowed or are surviving civil partners

  * Getting a pension 
  * Getting a [ taxable social welfare payment ](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/claiming-a-social-welfare-payment/taxation-of-social-welfare-payments/)

If you are self-employed, you get the [ Earned Income Tax Credit
