###  **Income add-backs**

There are a number of deductions that are allowed by Revenue, which are not
allowed for the Student Grant Scheme means test. For example, depreciation.
These deductions are added back to your reckonable income when assessing you
for the grant, which increases your income for the means test. These are known
as ‘add-backs’.

The Teagasc grant does not include some of the Student Grant Scheme ‘add-
backs’ in its means test. So, deductions for the following items are not added
to your reckonable income for the Teagasc grant:

  * Payments to family labour 
  * Finance lease payments 
  * Interest on capital expenditure 
  * Depreciation 

**The household income limits for the Teagasc Maintenance Grant are the same
as the** [ **Student Grant Scheme limits**
