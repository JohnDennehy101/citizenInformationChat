##  Introduction

There are a variety of courses available if you are interested in farming, or
are already farming and want to upskill or learn about a new area.

You may also need to complete a farming course to access some farming schemes
and payments, such as the [ Organic Farming Scheme
](/en/environment/land/organic-farming-scheme/) .

Many farming courses are run by [ Teagasc ](https://www.teagasc.ie/) while
others are run by [ third-level colleges
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/education/third-level-education/fees-
and-supports-for-third-level-education/student-grant-scheme/) , sometimes in
partnership with Teagasc.

There are grants and schemes available to help you with the cost of studying.

There are also a number of apprenticeships available if you are interested in
getting practical experience in farming.

You may choose to work on a farm as a [ seasonal worker
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/employment/types-of-
employment/different-types-of-workers/#4ba463) , for example, during the
summer holidays. This can be a useful way of getting experience in farming
before signing up to a course or apprenticeship.
