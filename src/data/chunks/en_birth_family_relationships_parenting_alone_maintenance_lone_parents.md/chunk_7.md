##  Preparing for court

The Courts Service has information to help you to [ prepare for attending a
family law court ](https://services.courts.ie/Family-Law/preparing-for-family-
law-court/how-to-prepare-for-a-court-hearing) . Family law cases are heard in
camera. This means they are heard in private to protect the privacy of the
family. It does not mean they are filmed or videoed.

It also can be helpful to know:

You have [ the right to appeal ](https://services.courts.ie/Family-
Law/appealing-a-court-decision/appealing-a-district-court-order) if you are
not happy with the decision of the judge. If you wish to appeal the decision,
you must file your appeal documents within the relevant timelines for each
court. For instance, if you want to appeal a District Court decision or order,
you must file your appeal documents within 14 days of the court hearing. In
some cases, you can apply to the Circuit Court for an extension of time to
appeal. You should seek legal advice regarding your appeal.
