##  Making a maintenance agreement

There are 3 main ways that you can [ make a maintenance arrangement
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/birth-family-relationships/separation-
and-divorce/maintenance-orders-and-agreements/#a3dad6) :

  * A voluntary maintenance agreement 
  * A voluntary maintenance agreement using mediation or legal help 
  * A maintenance order 

If you have had a child outside of marriage and cannot come to a voluntary
maintenance agreement, you may apply to the court to order the other parent to
pay child maintenance. In most cases, it is the parent with main [ custody
](/en/birth-family-relationships/cohabiting-couples/custody-of-children-
cohabiting-couples/) of the child that makes such an application.

When the court is deciding whether to make a maintenance order in respect of a
child, it will consider the income, earning capacity, property and other
financial resources of both parties. It will also consider whether either
parent has other financial responsibilities such as a spouse or other
dependent children.

The children of parents who are not married to each other may have to [ prove
paternity ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/birth-family-
relationships/separation-and-divorce/presumption-of-paternity/) in order to
get their maintenance or inheritance entitlements. This is not necessary if
the father acknowledges paternity or is named as the child's father on the
childâ€™s birth certificate.
