##  Getting legal advice

If you are considering entering into a surrogacy arrangement, you should seek
legal advice, ideally from a family law solicitor who specialises in surrogacy
arrangements.

The solicitor will give you all the relevant information in relation to:

  * The various legal issues associated with surrogacy 
  * The importance of signing a surrogacy agreement 
  * The documentation and forms you need to prepare (particularly if you are choosing surrogacy abroad) 
  * How to apply for guardianship of the child so that you can legally make decisions in relation to their care
