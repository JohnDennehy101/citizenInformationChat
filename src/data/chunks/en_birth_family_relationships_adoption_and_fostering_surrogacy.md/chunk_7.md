###  How does this impact the commissioning parents?

As the _commissioning mother_ (the intended mother of the child) is not
considered the ‘legal mother’, the commissioning mother has no legal
connection to the child at birth. She does not have a right to make decisions
in relation to:

  * Birth registration 
  * Citizenship and passports 
  * Succession rights (for example, inheritance) 
  * Childcare 
  * Adoption 
  * Social welfare 
  * Education
