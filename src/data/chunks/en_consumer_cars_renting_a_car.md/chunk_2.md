##  Introduction

If you have a valid driving licence, you can rent a car or a larger vehicle.

You will usually have to show proof of identity (for example, your passport)
and a credit card (or debit card if accepted). You will also need to show your
valid driving licence. Check with the rental company to see if you need more
documentation, for example [ an international driverâ€™s permit ](/en/travel-
and-recreation/motoring/driver-licensing/international-driving-permit/) .

There are many companies offering car rental services. Check you are using [
an approved car rental company
](http://www.carrentalcouncil.ie/Companies.html) . If you are going through a
car hire broker, check they are using an approved car rental company. Approved
car rental companies must make sure all rentals are safe and roadworthy.
