##  Returning the car

When you return the car to the car rental company, make sure that you have the
car checked while you are there. Any damage should be noted and agreed with
the rental company, to avoid charges for damage you did not know about.

Even if you bought a damage waiver, car rental companies can charge your card
for any excess amounts if there is a lot of damage.

If you are returning the car when the office is closed, make sure you know
what to do and who to contact if there are any problems. The rental agreement
should cover the arrangements and procedures for out of hours returns.
