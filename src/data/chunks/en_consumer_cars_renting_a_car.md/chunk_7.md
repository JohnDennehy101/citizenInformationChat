##  Drivers over 75

If you are 75 or over, you may have to meet some extra conditions before
hiring a car.

For example, you could be asked for:

  * Confirmation that you drive regularly 
  * A letter from your insurer to say you have an up-to-date policy and no accidents in last 5 years 
  * A letter from your doctor confirming you are fit to drive 

You could also be asked to do a driving assessment with a staff member from
the car hire company.
