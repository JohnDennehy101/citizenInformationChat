##  Important checks at pickup

Make sure to check the car thoroughly before you drive away.

You will usually get a diagram of the car with exterior damage marked on it.
Check the car for any extra damage and make sure this is recorded before you
drive away. You can be charged for any damage that is not marked on the
diagram or damage report.

Even if you arrive at the car rental depot at night, use a torch or flash
light to give the car a thorough check before you accept it.

**Other things to check**  
---  
**Tyres** |  Check they are inflated and in good condition.  Check the spare tyre as well.   
**Tools** |  Check there is a jack and a wrench to replace a tyre if you get a puncture.  Make sure you have all the safety equipment you need for the area you are travelling.   
**Fuel** |  Ask if the car runs on petrol or diesel (you may have to cover any damage if you put the wrong type of fuel in the car).  Usually you need to refill the car before you return it. Check you have a full tank when you start.   
**Lights** |  Check your lights are all working properly, including indicators, break lights and fog lights.   
**Windscreen** |  Give the windscreen a thorough check and ask for any flaws to be repaired. Make sure that the wiper blades and the windscreen wash system is working properly.
