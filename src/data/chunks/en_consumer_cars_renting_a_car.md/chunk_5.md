##  Insurance

Make sure you have the right insurance. If you and someone else will both be
driving the car, make sure you both have insurance. You must have at least [
third-party insurance cover ](/en/travel-and-recreation/motoring-1/motor-tax-
and-insurance/motor-insurance#l93e5c) .

The rental company may offer you a lower price for not giving you particular
cover (such as collision damage). Before you agree to waive any cover, make
sure you understand what it means and whether it's worth the risk. Ask how
this discount works, for example, you may have to pay a deposit in case you
damage the car in a crash.
