##  Rental agreement

You will be asked to sign a rental agreement or contract when you pick up the
car. Before you sign it, make sure you have read it and understand what your
obligations are. For example, you may need to return the car with a full tank
of fuel to avoid extra charges. If you are unsure about anything, always ask
your rental company to explain it to you.

If you plan on taking the rented car across a national border, ask the car
rental company beforehand if this is possible.
