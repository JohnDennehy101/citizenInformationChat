##  Enforcement order

The court can impose an enforcement order if you have been unreasonably denied
the access the court granted you. This may include:

  * You getting compensatory or additional time with the child 
  * Your expenses being reimbursed as a result of the refusal to allow the access 
  * One or both of you attending parenting programmes, family counselling or receiving information on mediation
