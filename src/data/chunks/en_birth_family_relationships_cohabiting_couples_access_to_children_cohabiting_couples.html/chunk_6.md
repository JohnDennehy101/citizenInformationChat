##  How to apply for access

Most applications for guardianship, custody and access are made in the
District Court. In some situations, relating to more complex cases, an
application can be made in the Circuit Court or the High Court. Each court has
its own rules on how to apply for a court order.

If you are making an application for access, you can apply to the District
Court office in the area you or the respondent is working or living in.

children/access) explains the steps involved in making an application to a
