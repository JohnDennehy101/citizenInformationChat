##  Introduction

The breakdown of a relationship is a difficult and traumatic process. There
are many issues to be worked out such as financial support, the family home,
guardianship, and the access and custody of children.

  * **Access** is the legal right of a child and an adult to have contact with one another when they no longer live together. 
  * **Custody** is the day-to-day care and home life of a dependent child under the age of 18. 
  * **Guardianship** is a person's legal responsibility to make decisions and perform duties regarding a child's upbringing.
