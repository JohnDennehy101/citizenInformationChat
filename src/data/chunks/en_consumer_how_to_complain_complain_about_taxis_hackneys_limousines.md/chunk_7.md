###  **How to complain**

You can [ make your complaint online
](http://transportforireland.ie/taxi/taxi-compliments-complaints/) . The NTA
also has an information line on 0818 064 000.

Remember to give all relevant details about the incident and include a copy of
your receipt (if you got one).

Give as much information about the driver and the vehicle you are complaining
about. The NTA will need it to identify the driver and investigate your
complaint.
