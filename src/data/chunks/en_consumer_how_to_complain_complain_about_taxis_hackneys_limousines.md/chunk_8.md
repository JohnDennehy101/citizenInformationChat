###  **How your complaint is dealt with**

Your complaint will be investigated by the NTAâ€™s enforcement team. If there is
a dispute, the investigators will examine the evidence provided by all
parties.

Once this evidence has been collected and evaluated, the NTA will issue its
decision.

The NTA could decide to:

  * Take no more action 
  * Give advice to the operator 
  * Issue a formal warning 
  * Escalate the complaint for prosecution in court 

You may have to attend court to give evidence regarding the incident. You
cannot make a complaint anonymously.
