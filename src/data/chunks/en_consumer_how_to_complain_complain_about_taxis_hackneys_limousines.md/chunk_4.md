##  Complain to the dispatch operator

/'If you booked through a dispatch operator (including taxi booking apps), you
should complain to the operator first. In some situations, discussing the
problem with the manager or a senior staff member at the company can resolve
your complaint.

If you prefer to make a more formal complaint, or you are not happy with the
response to your informal complaint, you can put your complaint in writing to
the dispatch operator.

If this does not resolve your complaint, you can make a complaint to the
National Transport Authority.
