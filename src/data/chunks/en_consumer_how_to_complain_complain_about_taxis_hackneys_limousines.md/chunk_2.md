##  Introduction

Taxis, hackneys and limousines are types of ‘small public service vehicles’ or
SPSVs. Drivers of SPSVs must have a licence to carry passengers and the car
they are using must be licenced too.

The National Transport Authority (NTA) is the regulator of SPSVs and it has a
complaints process you can use if you have a bad experience with a licenced
taxi, limousine or hackney service.
