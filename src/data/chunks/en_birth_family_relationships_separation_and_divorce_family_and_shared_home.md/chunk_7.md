###  Property adjustment order

One of the biggest difficulties facing separating couples is what should
happen to their family or shared home. If agreement cannot be reached as to
who will occupy and own the home, the court can make an order in relation to
it.

An order in relation to the family or shared home is usually applied for when
applying for a decree of judicial separation, divorce or dissolution, and it
is referred to as a _property adjustment order_ .

In making a property adjustment order, a court will consider all of the family
circumstances and will take into account the welfare of a dependent spouse or
civil partner and any dependent children. The court order will state the
following:

  * Who has the right to live in the family or shared home and for how long 
  * Who has ownership rights in the family or shared home and what share each partner owns
