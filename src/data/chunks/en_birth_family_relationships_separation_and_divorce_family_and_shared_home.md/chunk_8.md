###  Who has the right to live in the home and for how long?

In the case of a married couple where there are children, the spouse with whom
the children live will often be given the right to live in the family home
until the youngest child reaches 18 or 23. This can provide a sense of
continuity for children who are experiencing the separation of their parents.
The [ Children and Family Relationships Act 2015
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2015/act/9/enacted/en/html) has amended
the civil partnership legislation to provide similar protection for dependent
children of civil partners.

The court can make an exclusion order in relation to the spouse or civil
partner who is leaving the home. An exclusion order reflects the recognition
of the courts that it is not practical for separated couples to occupy the
same house, or for the partner who leaves to retain a key and have free access
to the house. It does not imply any unacceptable conduct on the part of the
partner who is excluded from the house.
