###  Who has ownership rights in the home and what share does each person
have?

A court can order that the house is sold and the proceeds divided equally or
in whatever shares it considers fair. It can order that the sale be delayed
for a specified period of time, for example, while dependent childrent are
young. It can order the transfer of the house into joint names or into the
sole name of one spouse or civil partner. If the house is held under a tenancy
from a local authority, it can order the transfer of the tenancy.
