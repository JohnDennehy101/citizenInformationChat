##  Getting advice

Whether you are considering separating or applying for a decree of divorce or
dissolution, it is advisable to get legal advice.

If you choose to hire a private solicitor, there is no fixed rate of charges
for legal fees in Ireland. You should get some quotes before deciding on a
legal firm. [ Contact information for solicitors firms
](https://www.lawsociety.ie/Find-a-Solicitor/Solicitor-Firm-Search/)
throughout Ireland is available on the Law Society website.

To enquire whether you are [ eligible for legal aid or advice
](/en/justice/legal-aid-and-advice/civil-legal-advice-and-legal-aid/) from the
Legal Aid Board, contact [ your nearest law centre
](http://www.legalaidboard.ie/lab/Publishing.nsf/Content/Law_Centres) . The
law centre staff will assess your means (income) and let you know if you are
eligible. Legal aid is not typically free and everyone must normally pay a
contribution towards costs.
