###  Your property rights if you are cohabiting

If you are cohabiting (living together but not married or in a civil
partnership) and your relationship breaks down, the property will belong to
the person who holds the legal title to the home. This could be one of you, or
both of you. However, the other person may have a right to redress through the
courts. To find out more, read our page [ Property rights and the breakdown of
a relationship ](/en/birth-family-relationships/problems-in-marriages-and-
other-relationships/property-rights-and-the-breakdown-of-a-cohabiting-
relationship/) .
