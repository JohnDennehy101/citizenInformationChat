##  What is the Community Services Programme

The Community Services Programme (CSP) supports community-based organisations
to provide local services and create employment opportunities for
disadvantaged groups and people, such as people with disabilities, Travellers,
recovering drug misusers, ex-prisoners, and long- term unemployed.

It gives financial support to community companies and co-operatives to help
with the cost of hiring staff.

The programme focuses on communities where public and private sector services
are lacking, either through geographical or social isolation or because of low
levels of demand.

The [ Community Services Programme ](https://www.gov.ie/en/policy-
information/487d0f-the-community-services-programme/) is managed by Pobal on
behalf of the Department of Rural and Community Development.
