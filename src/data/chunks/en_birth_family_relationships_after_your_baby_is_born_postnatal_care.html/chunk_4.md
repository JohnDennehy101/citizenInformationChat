##  Postnatal check-up for you

If you have had a normal delivery, you will have a [ postnatal check-up
](https://www2.hse.ie/wellbeing/babies-and-children/parenting-advice/health-
mental-wellbeing/postnatal-check-up/) after 6 weeks. This is usually carried
out either by your GP or your obstetrician. Your GP or obstetrician will
discuss any health problems with you. They may also examine your wound if you
had a caesarean section or a tear.

Your postnatal check may also include:

  * Checking your blood pressure, particularly if you had high blood pressure during or after your pregnancy 
  * Weighing you â€“ if your body mass index (BMI) is high, your doctor will give you some advice on ways to reduce this 

You may also want to ask your doctor for advice on [ breastfeeding
](/en/birth-family-relationships/after-your-baby-is-born/breastfeeding/) .

Your GP or obstetrician can advise you on options for contraception. If you
are due a [ cervical screening ](/en/health/health-services/cancer-
services/cervical-screening-programme/) , they may schedule a screening for 3
months after the birth.
