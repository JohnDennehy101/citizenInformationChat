##  How much can I borrow?

The amount you can borrow depends on:

  * Your household’s borrowing capacity. You need to show that you can afford your monthly mortgage repayments, which must be less than 35% of your net household income. 
  * The loan to value for the home you are buying 
  * The Vacant Property Refurbishment Grant amount you have been approved for 
  * The level of renovation work you need for your home and the project viability 
  * The estimated value of your home 

The value of your home for this loan is taken as the projected value of the
property after the renovations are done. This value cannot exceed the maximum
market property values for the Local Authority Home Loan in your area.

The maximum value is different depending on where your home is located:

  * €360,000 in Dublin, Kildare, Wicklow
