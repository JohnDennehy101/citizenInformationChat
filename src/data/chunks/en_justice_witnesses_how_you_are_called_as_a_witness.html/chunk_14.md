###  Taking time off work to be a witness

If you have to take time off work to go to court, you will not be paid for the
time you are away from work. However, you may be entitled to [ witness
expenses ](/en/justice/witnesses/how-you-are-called-as-a-witness#l5146b) . If
your employer wants you to take this time off work as [ annual leave
](/en/employment/employment-rights-and-conditions/leave-and-holidays/annual-
leave/) , the normal conditions for taking annual leave apply.
