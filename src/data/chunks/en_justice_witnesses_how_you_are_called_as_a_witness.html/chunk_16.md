###  Taking the stand

At the trial, you may be one of a number of witnesses who are going to give
evidence. Normally you will wait in the court and watch the trial until it is
your turn to give evidence. Sometimes you may be asked to leave the court and
if that happens, you will be told when to return.

When it is your turn to give evidence, the solicitor or barrister for the
person who called you as a witness will stand up and name you as the next
witness. You walk up to the front of the court and go into the witness box.

You can take an oath or affirmation. To take an oath, you stand in the witness
box and the court registrar hands you a Bible or the holy text for your
religion, if it is available. You hold the Bible or holy text and repeat the
following oath after the registrar. The oath is "I swear by Almighty God (or
whoever is relevant according to your religious belief) that the evidence I
shall give shall be the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth".

You must tell the registrar if you want to take the affirmation instead of the
oath. If the holy text for your religion isnâ€™t available to take the oath, you
can take the affirmation instead. The words of the affirmation are "I, do
solemnly, sincerely and truly declare and affirm that the evidence that I
shall give shall be the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth".
When you have repeated your oath or affirmation, you will sit down.

coming into the court.
