###  Former spouses of the accused

You are a former spouse if you are divorced from the accused, or if you have a
judicial separation or a separation agreement with the accused. If you are a
former spouse you can be forced to testify for the defence or the prosecution
about offences that were committed since your separation.

However, you cannot be forced to give evidence against the accused about
offences that were committed when you were still married, unless:

  * The offence in question is of violence or the threat of violence to you, your child or the accused’s child, or a person under 17 (includes an adopted child or a child for whom you are acting 'in loco parentis’) 
  * The offence is a sexual offence in relation to your child, the accused’s child or a person under 17 (includes an adopted child or a child for whom you are acting 'in loco parentis’) 
  * The offence consists of trying to or helping to commit either of the two offences above.
