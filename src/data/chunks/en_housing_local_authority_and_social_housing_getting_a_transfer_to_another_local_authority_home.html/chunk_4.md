##  Swapping local authority homes

You may be able to arrange a private transfer by finding someone who wants to
swap their local authority home with yours. Both households must meet certain
criteria in this situation. For example, the swap must not mean there will be
overcrowding in either home and the local authority must agree to the swap.

You can also arrange a private transfer with someone from a different local
authority, once the accommodation is suitable for both households and the 2
local authorities agree to the swap.

To apply, you must complete an application form and submit it to your local
authority. You can usually get this form on your local authority’s website.

If you want swap homes, you may be able to find details of other people who
want to swap in your local authority’s office, in local newspapers or online.
