##  Other supports at work

After you tell your employer about the situation, your employer may discuss
other ways to ensure your safety at work.

Possible ways to keep you safe include changes to work duties, location,
contact details and other enhanced security measures. Any workplace safety
plan is confidential and shared on a need-to know basis.

If there is a serious threat to your life or health, your employer may take
action to refer you to a specialist organisation such as [ Safe Ireland
](https://www.safeireland.ie/get-help/where-to-find-help/) . Your employer
should talk to you first before deciding whether a situation is a serious
threat.

You or your employer can refer to the DV at Work [ detailed guidance note
](https://dvatwork.ie/) for different support options available. It covers:

  * Travelling to and from work 
  * Safety on and off site 
  * Working from home 
  * Workplace communication 
  * Flexible working arrangements 
  * Financial needs 
  * Performance and behaviour 
  * Employee absence 
  * Perpetrator presence or contact 
  * Specialist support
