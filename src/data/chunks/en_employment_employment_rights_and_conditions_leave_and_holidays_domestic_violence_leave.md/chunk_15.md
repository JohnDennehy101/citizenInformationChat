##  Your employment rights

In general, you will be treated as if you are in work during domestic violence
leave.

This means:

  * Your time on domestic violence leave does not break your continuous service. It also counts as service when calculating entitlements such as annual leave and public holidays. 
  * You must not be dismissed for taking or asking to take domestic violence leave. 
  * You must not be [ victimised ](/en/employment/enforcement-and-redress/victimisation-at-work/) for taking or asking to take domestic violence leave. Your employer cannot penalise or treat you unfairly by, for example, giving you worse conditions of employment or selecting you for redundancy.
