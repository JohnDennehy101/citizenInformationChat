###  Disclosing your experience to your employer

Getting support from your employer means you need to disclose your experience
to someone at work. In most jobs, employees usually tell their direct manager
about absences.

Or, your employer may assign a specific or _designated_ person to handle
matters related to domestic violence leave and other available support. The
designated person could be a HR manager or the business owner.

Your employer should make sure the designated person is well-trained to handle
employee disclosures properly.
