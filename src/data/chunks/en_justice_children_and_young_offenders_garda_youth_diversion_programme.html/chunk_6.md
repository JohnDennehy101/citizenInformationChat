Young people who commit criminal offences or anti-social behaviour can be
dealt with by a _caution_ under the Diversion Programme, which informs them
that they have committed an offence or anti-social behaviour. This is instead
of the formal process of charge and prosecution for offences or an anti-social
behaviour order.

A caution is a warning by An Garda Síochána against committing the offending
behaviour or similar behaviour again.
