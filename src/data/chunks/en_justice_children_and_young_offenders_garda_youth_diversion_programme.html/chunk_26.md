###  **Action plan**

When a conference is called, an action plan is normally agreed for the child.
The action plan must be agreed by all those present at the conference, unless
the facilitator believes a personâ€™s refusal to consent is unreasonable.

An action plan is usually an outcome of the conference but is not compulsory.
