###  How is a formal caution delivered?

The formal caution is given by a JLO, a Garda inspector or a more senior
officer. The following people must be present when a caution is given:

  * The child 
  * The childâ€™s parents or guardians 
  * A JLO (if the JLO is not administering the caution). 

The Director of the Programme may also invite the victim of the crime to
attend.

There is no specific wording or procedure for administering the caution. The
officer who gives the caution, however, normally discusses the behaviour and
highlights to the child the seriousness of their actions.

The child may be invited to apologise to the victim and, where appropriate,
make financial or other amends to the victim.

The formal caution normally takes place in a Garda station to highlight the
seriousness of the situation to the child.
