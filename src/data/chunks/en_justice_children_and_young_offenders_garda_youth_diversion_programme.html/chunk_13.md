###  **Protections when in** **the Garda Youth Diversion** **Programme?**

Any child who has been admitted to the Diversion Programme is protected from:

  * Prosecution for the criminal behaviour that caused their admission, or 
  * Application for an anti-social behaviour for the anti-social behaviour that caused their admission to the programme. 

If the child accepts responsibility for their behaviour for which they have
been admitted to the programme, such acceptance cannot be used in any criminal
proceedings against that child unless the child is convicted for behaviour
which occurred after their admission to the programme.

**The child's identity is protected**

The identity of a child who is admitted to or considered for admission to the
programme is not disclosed publicly. A person who publishes or broadcasts such
information is guilty of an offence.
