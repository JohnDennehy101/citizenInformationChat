###  Who runs the conference?

The Director of the Diversion Programme will decide whether to hold a
conference.

Before the decision:

  * The Juvenile Liaison Officer (JLO) supervising a child recommends in writing that a conference is held. 
  * The childâ€™s parents or guardians must agree to the conference 

The child's consent is not required but their views must be obtained on the
matter.

The Director must appoint a facilitator to convene and chair the conference.
The facilitator person must be the supervising JLO or another Garda.
