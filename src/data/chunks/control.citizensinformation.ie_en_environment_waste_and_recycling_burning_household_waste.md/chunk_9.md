You should always let the local fire department know when you are planning a
burn and when the burn is over and the fire is extinguished.

You should only carry out a burn if the weather is suitable, with light or no
winds. Met Éireann have a [ Fire Weather Index
](https://www.met.ie/forecasts/farming/graphs/Fire-weather-index) which you
should check before planning a fire.
