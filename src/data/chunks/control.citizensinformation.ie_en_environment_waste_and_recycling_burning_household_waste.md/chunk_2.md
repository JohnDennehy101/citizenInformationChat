##  Can I burn waste at home?

Burning waste in your home or garden is illegal, as it can release harmful
chemicals into the air. It is illegal to burn household or garden waste in any
way, including:

  * In a barrel or exposed pile in a yard or garden 
  * On a bonfire 
  * On an open fire, range or other solid fuel appliance 
  * In a mini-incinerator 

**Note:** Garden incinerators and similar devices are illegal, even if they
are attached to a stack or flue.

This is an offence under:

  * [ Waste management regulations ](https://www.epa.ie/publications/compliance--enforcement/waste/burning-of-waste-regs.php)
  * [ The Air Pollution Act 1987 ](https://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1987/act/6/enacted/en/print.html)

If you are convicted of burning waste in your home or garden, you can be fined
up to â‚¬5,000.
