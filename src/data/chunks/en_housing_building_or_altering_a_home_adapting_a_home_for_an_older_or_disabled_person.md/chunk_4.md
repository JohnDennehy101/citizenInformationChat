##  Financial supports for adapting your home

Adapting your home may be expensive, particularly if you need to make
structural changes. There are several ways to get help with the cost:

  * You may qualify for a means-tested [ Housing Adaptation Grant for People with a Disability ](/en/housing/housing-grants-and-schemes/housing-supports-for-older-people-and-people-with-disabilities/housing-adaptation-grant-for-people-with-disability/) . The maximum grant is €30,000. 
  * For smaller changes, such as grab rails, exterior handrails or a stairlift, the [ Mobility Aids Grant Scheme ](/en/housing/housing-grants-and-schemes/housing-supports-for-older-people-and-people-with-disabilities/mobility-aids-grant-scheme/) (also means-tested) provides a maximum grant of €6,000. 
  * The [ Housing Aid for Older Persons Scheme ](/en/housing/housing-grants-and-schemes/housing-supports-for-older-people-and-people-with-disabilities/housing-aid-for-older-people-grant/) is used to improve the condition of an older person's home. The type of work that is covered depends on your local authority and may include structural repairs, re-wiring and upgrades to heating systems. For information on what is covered in your area, contact your local authority. 
  * You may qualify for a [ local authority home improvement loan ](/en/housing/housing-grants-and-schemes/local-authority-housing-grants-and-supports/local-authority-home-improvement-loans/) to improve, repair or extend your home. 
  * If you have a [ medical card ](/en/health/medical-cards-and-gp-visit-cards/medical-card/) or a [ long-term illness card ](/en/health/drugs-and-medicines/long-term-illness-scheme/) , you may be able to get essential items of equipment for free. First, you must be assessed by a relevant professional, such as an occupational therapist or a physiotherapist. 
  * If you are buying equipment needed for someone with a disability, you may be able to claim a [ VAT refund. ](/en/money-and-tax/tax/tax-credits-and-reliefs-for-people-with-disabilities/vat-refunds-on-aids-and-appliances-used-by-people-with-disabilities/)
  * Depending on the work being done, you may qualify for the [ Better Energy Warmer Homes Scheme ](/en/housing/housing-grants-and-schemes/grants-for-home-renovations-and-improvements/warmer-homes-scheme/) or the [ Better Energy Homes Scheme. ](/en/housing/housing-grants-and-schemes/grants-for-home-renovations-and-improvements/better-energy-homes-scheme/)

You should check to see if you qualify for any of these schemes. If you do,
you should apply and get approval before beginning any work. You should also
check how the different schemes and grants interact with each other.
