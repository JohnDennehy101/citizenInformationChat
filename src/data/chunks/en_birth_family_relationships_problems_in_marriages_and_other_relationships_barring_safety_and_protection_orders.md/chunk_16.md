###  Children

The Domestic Violence Act 2018 contains specific provisions for the protection
of children including:

  * Children can make their views known to the court where a safety or barring order is sought on behalf of, or will partly relate to, a child. The court can appoint an expert to assist the court to get the views of the child depending on the childâ€™s age and maturity. 
  * When giving evidence in an application for a domestic violence order, a child cannot be cross-examined in person by the respondent or the applicant. 
  * Domestic violence orders relating to children remain in force until the order expires even after they reach the age of 18. Previously they expired when the child became 18 years old.
