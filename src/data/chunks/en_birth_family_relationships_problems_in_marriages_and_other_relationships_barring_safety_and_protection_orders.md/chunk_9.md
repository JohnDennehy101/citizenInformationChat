###  What is an emergency barring order?

An [ emergency barring order ](https://services.courts.ie/Family-Law/domestic-
violence/understanding-court-orders-and-eligibility/what-is-an-interim-
barring-order) requires the person accused of violent or abusive behaviour to
leave the home, and prohibits them from entering the home. This is an
immediate order where there is reasonable grounds to believe there is an
immediate risk of significant harm to you or a dependent person.

Unlike an interim barring order, the applicant does not have to satisfy the
property test to be able to get an emergency barring order. This means the
person applying for the order does not need to own, co-own or have their name
on the lease of the property. An emergency barring order can last for a
maximum of 8 working days. It prohibits the same behaviours as a barring
order.

When the 8-day time limit ends, you may have to wait for one month to apply
for another. In exceptional circumstances, a judge can waive or ignore this
one-month wait time.
