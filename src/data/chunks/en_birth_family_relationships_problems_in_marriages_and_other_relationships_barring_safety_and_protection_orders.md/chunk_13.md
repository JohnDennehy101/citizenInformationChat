###  Cohabiting couples

If you have lived together in an intimate relationship, you can get a safety
order against a violent partner. You can also get a safety order against a
person you have had a child with but are not living with or have never lived
with.

You can get a barring order against a violent partner if you have been living
together in an intimate relationship and your partner does not own most or all
of the house you are living in. There is no minimum period of cohabitation
(living together) required.

You can get an emergency barring order where there are reasonable grounds to
believe there is an immediate risk of significant harm to you or a dependent
even if you do not own, co-own or have your name on the lease.
