###  What is an interim barring order?

Between the time of making an application for a barring order and the courtâ€™s
determination (decision), there may be reasonable grounds for believing that
the safety and welfare of you or of a dependent person is at risk. If so, the
court can grant a protection order (see above) or an interim barring order. An
interim barring order is a temporary, immediate short-term order. It can last
for a maximum of 8 working days. It requires the person accused of violent or
abusive behaviour to leave the home where there is an immediate risk of
significant harm to you or a dependent person (and a protection order would
not give sufficient protection).

You can apply for an interim barring order while you wait for the court to
hear your full application for a full barring order. Both applications can be
made at the same time.
