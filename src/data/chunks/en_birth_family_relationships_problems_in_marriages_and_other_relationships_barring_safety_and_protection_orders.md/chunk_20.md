###  **What if there is an emergency?**

If there is an emergency situation or while you are waiting to go to court to
get a barring order or safety order, you can get a protection order, an
interim barring order, or an emergency barring order if you or a dependent
child is at immediate risk of significant harm. If there is no sitting of the
District Court at the time when you wish to make such an application, a member
of the Garda√≠ may request the Courts Service to arrange a special sitting of
the District Court. If you do not want a protection order or an interim
barring order immediately, you can seek one at any time before your case is
heard for a safety or barring order.

Further information on making an application and preparing for a court hearing
is available on the [ Courts Service website
