###  Employers paying employees’ 2020 income tax and USC liability

Revenue is facilitating employers who want to pay the 2020 income tax and USC
liabilities of their employees, where the liability arose from the TWSS.

On a once-off, exceptional basis, an employer can make these payments, without
having to apply Benefit-in- Kind (BIK) rules. This is known as _concessional
treatment_ for BIK and TWSS debts.

The concession applies to the liabilities of employees, self-assessed
employees and proprietary directors (subject to certain conditions).

Employers have until **end of September 2021** to make the payments on behalf
of their employees.
