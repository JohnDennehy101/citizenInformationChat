##  Introduction

This document is about the COVID-19 Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme, which
closed on 31 August 2020. It was replaced by the [ Employment Wage Subsidy
Scheme (EWSS). ](/en/employment/unemployment-and-redundancy/employment-wage-
subsidy-scheme/)

**This page can be used for reference purposes for information on the
operation of the TWSS up until it closed on 31 August 2020.**

The Temporary COVID-19 Wage Subsidy Scheme was announced on 24 March 2020. It
replaced the Revenue Employer COVID-19 Refund Scheme.

It allowed employers to continue to pay their employees during COVID-19. It
aimed to keep employees registered with their employers, so that they could
get back to work quickly after the pandemic.

The new EWSS commenced on 1 July 2020. The two schemes ran in parallel from 1
July until the TWSS closed on 31 August 2020.
