###  **Primary school teachers**

You are deemed a fully qualified primary teacher if you:

  * Completed a recognised teacher education qualification and programme of induction, and 
  * Can provide an official letter confirming you are fully qualified primary teacher from the relevant teacher registration body, competent authority, or Ministry of Education in that country. The Teaching Council has [ list of competent authorities ](https://www.teachingcouncil.ie/register/list-of-competent-authorities-2/) available. 

The Teaching Council will assess your qualification to ensure it is of a
standard comparable to those of accredited programmes in Ireland. If there are
significant differences, ‘conditions’ (these are also called ‘qualification
shortfalls’) are applied to your registration as a teacher (referred to as
‘conditional registration’).

If the Teaching Council grants you conditional registration, they will inform
you of the conditions applied, the measures you need to take to complete them,
and the deadline when they need to be met. Your conditions are recorded on the
Register of Teachers and on your Certificate of Registration.
