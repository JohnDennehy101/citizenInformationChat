###  **1\. Application**

You must [ apply online using My Registration ](https://my-
tc.teachingcouncil.ie/Site-Login?returnurl=%2f) , and select the PRQA-01
option. You can save your application as a draft and return to work on it
later. You will have 3 months from the date you start your application to
complete and submit it. If you have not completed the application after 3
months, it will be deleted.

Make sure to save the required documents for the application as electronic
files that have relevant filenames, (for example, ‘Degree Transcript’). Upload
this documentation and then pay the necessary fees to submit the online
application form. You will receive an acknowledgement email confirming
submission, and if any documentation is missing, the Teaching Council will
contact you.

Be aware that it can take up to 12 weeks for the Teaching Council to assess
your qualifications from the date they receive all the required documents for
your application.
