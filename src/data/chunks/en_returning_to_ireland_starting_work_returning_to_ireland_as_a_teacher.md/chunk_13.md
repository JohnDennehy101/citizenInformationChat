####  **Vetting**

If you lived for 12 months or more outside of Ireland after the age of 18, you
will need to provide police clearance documents from all countries where you
previously lived. These clearance certificates must cover the entire period of
residence in each country.

The Teaching Council has additional information available on [ how to apply
for vetting ](https://www.teachingcouncil.ie/vetting/guide-to-applying-for-
vetting/) and [ overseas police clearance
](https://www.teachingcouncil.ie/vetting/overseas-police-clearance/) .
