###  **2\. Assessment**

At this stage, a Qualifications Panel assesses the application you submitted
and determines if there are any conditions that need to be applied to your
registration. If the Panel decides to apply any conditions, or if your
application is refused, they will contact you by email.

You can request a review of the decision within 21 days of the Panelâ€™s
decision by emailing [ info@teachingcouncil.ie
](mailto:info@teachingcouncil.ie) with your application reference number or
registration number. The Teaching Council will then email you an application
form.

When appealing, you can include additional evidence of qualifications and
provide a written submission to the Registration Committee Review Group that
will make an evaluation. More details are available from the Teaching Council
about [ the review process for appeals
](https://www.teachingcouncil.ie/register/registration-review-process/) .
