####  **3\. Full temporary release**

If your day-to-day temporary release has gone well and you have shown that you
can reintegrate into the community, the Minister for Justice may grant you
full temporary release.

In practice, this provision ends the custodial portion of your sentence unless
you are recalled to prison for any reason.
