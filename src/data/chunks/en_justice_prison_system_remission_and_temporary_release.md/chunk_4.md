###  Standard remission

Standard remission allows you to shorten the length of your sentence by up to
one quarter. In most cases, you get standard remission automatically once you
do not commit an offence in custody.

For example, if you are sentenced to 4 years in prison, you may be released
after 3 years, with the final quarter of your sentence remitted.
