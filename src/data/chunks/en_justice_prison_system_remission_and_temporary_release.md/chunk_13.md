##  Parole

Parole is a form of early release from prison under certain conditions. If you
are released on parole, your sentence is not over â€“ you are just serving your
sentence in the community.

You can apply for parole if you have served at least 10 and a half years of a
life sentence, but you cannot be granted parole unless you have served at
least 12 years of your sentence.

If you are released on parole, you must follow all the conditions of your
parole order. These conditions apply for the remaining time of your sentence.

You can be sent back to prison if you reoffend or break any of the conditions
of your parole order.
