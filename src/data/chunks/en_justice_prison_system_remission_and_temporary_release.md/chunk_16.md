###  **Second and subsequent reviews**

You may have to go through the parole process several times and show
meaningful progress before you are granted parole.

If your application is refused, you will be given the reasons for the refusal
in writing. You will also be told when you can next apply for parole, which
will be within 2 years of the refusal decision.

The Parole Board may also offer guidance in its refusal decision on what steps
you need to take to make a successful application in future.
