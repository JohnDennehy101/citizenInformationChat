###  **The Probation Service**

[ The Probation Service
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/justice/probation-and-welfare-
services/probation-service/) supervises and supports offenders in the
community. In most cases, the Probation Service [ supervises prisoners on
temporary release ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/justice/probation-
and-welfare-services/probation-service/#32d292) .

You will be told about the Probation Service when you arrive in prison. An
officer may be assigned to work with you to address your offending behaviour
so that you can become eligible for temporary release at a later date.

For example, under the [ Community Return Scheme
](http://www.probation.ie/en/PB/Pages/WP16000037) , you can complete unpaid
work as a condition of your early release from prison. You need to pose no
threat to the community to be eligible for this scheme.
