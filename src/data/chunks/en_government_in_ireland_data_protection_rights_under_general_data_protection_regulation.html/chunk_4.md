###  Special Category Data

Some personal data is very sensitive and special rules apply to this
information. These special categories include information that reveals any of
the following:

  * Your race or ethnic origin 
  * Your political opinions 
  * Your religious or philosophical beliefs 
  * Your trade union membership 
  * Your health 
  * Any biometric information (for example, your fingerprints) or genetic data 
  * Your sexual orientation or sex life 

The processing of this information is only allowed where you have given your
explicit consent or where the information is absolutely necessary to meet
other legal requirements. For example, you may have to inform your employer of
your nationality to show that you have the legal right to work in Ireland.
