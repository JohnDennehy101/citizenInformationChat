##  Accessing records under Freedom of Information

You can also access your personal information under [ freedom of information
(FOI) ](/en/government-in-ireland/how-government-works/standards-and-
accountability/freedom-of-information/) . This only applies to information
held by public bodies (for example, government departments, local authorities
and public hospitals).

Your rights under FOI are similar to your rights under GDPR. FOI allows you to
access records containing your “personal information” and the data protection
regime grants access to your “personal data”.

Access requests can be made under FOI and data protection at the same time,
and you have similar rights in relation to the correction of any inaccurate
personal information.

There is no time limit to access personal information in respect of both, and
similar rules apply in relation to the organisation’s obligation to disclose.
Making access requests for personal information are generally free under both.

In many cases, there won’t be a material difference between the two systems
when making an access request in respect of your personal data from a public
body. However, there are some important differences in some areas. You can use
both systems at the same time or one after the other.
