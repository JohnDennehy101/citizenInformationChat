##  How will the company or organisation deal with my request?

The data controller must respond to your request within one month.

If the request is complex or involves a large amount of information, the data
controller can extend the time to respond by a further two months. You should
receive a written explanation for any extension within the initial one-month
period.

If your request is very broad and requires the data controller to provide a
large amount of information and documents, you may be asked to reduce the
number of documents containing personal data requested. However, you can
insist on receiving all the information and documentation held. If you do, it
may take longer to comply with your access request.

In general, the data controller should respond to your access request in the
same format the request was made, or in the way in which you specifically
asked for a response. For example, if you emailed your request, the data
controller should provide the information by email, unless you request
otherwise.
