###  Contact the relevant data protection officer

Many large organisations have a Data Protection Officer (or DPO) and they are
generally the best person to contact about your request for information. You
should be able to find their contact details in the privacy policy or ‘contact
us’ section of the organisation’s website. Where there is no specific email
address for a data access request, you should use the organisation’s general
contact details.
