####  **Blind Pension**

[ Blind Pension ](/en/social-welfare/disability-and-illness/blind-persons-
pension/) can be paid with OFP. This means that a person who qualifies for OFP
and Blind Pension can get both payments. You can get both Blind Pension and
OFP (and any IQCs paid with both Blind Pension and OFP) until your youngest
child turns 16.
