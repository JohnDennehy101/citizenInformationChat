####  **Domiciliary Care Allowance**

If you are getting [ Domiciliary Care Allowance (DCA) ](/en/social-
welfare/disability-and-illness/domiciliary-care-allowance/) for a child, you
can get OFP until the child reaches 16 or the DCA stops. You must meet the
other qualifying conditions for OFP.

You will also get an Increase for a Qualified Child (IQC) for any other
children in the family until they reach 18 (or 22 if in full-time education)
while DCA and OFP are paid.
