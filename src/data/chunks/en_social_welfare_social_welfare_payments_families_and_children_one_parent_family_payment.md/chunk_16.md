###  **Income from work**

The first â‚¬165 of your gross weekly earnings (wages and profit from self-
employment) is not taken into account in the means test.

Half the remainder of your gross earnings per week is assessed as means and
you may get a reduced rate of OFP.

Social insurance contributions, superannuation/PRSA contributions and trade
union subscriptions are not taken into account when calculating your gross
earnings.
