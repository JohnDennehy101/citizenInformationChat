##  Will I have to pay an aged-based loading if I'm over 35?

The cost of health insurance includes a _premium_ (the basic price) and a
_loading_ (an additional amount that depends on your age). If you are 35 or
older when you buy health insurance in Ireland for the first time, you may
have to pay an extra charge or age-based loading called the [ lifetime
community rating (LCR) ](https://www.hia.ie/consumer-information/lifetime-
community-rating-explained) .

If you lived outside Ireland on 1 May 2015 and buy health insurance within 9
months of moving to Ireland, you do not need to pay the LCR loading.

If you lived in Ireland on 1 May 2015 and moved outside Ireland on or after 1
November 2018, you can get a credit for periods you spent abroad of 6 months
or more. This is called a “qualifying credited period.” If you receive credit
for your time abroad, you will be assessed as if you had health insurance for
that time abroad, even if you did not have any cover.

You must prove to the insurance company that you were living abroad but you
returned to live in Ireland permanently in the last 9 months.

You can do this by providing:

  * Evidence of accommodation lease arrangements or utility bills abroad 
  * Travel documents or an application for a PPS number is accepted as proof of returning to live in Ireland 
  * A contract of employment for a job in Ireland 
  * Agreements for a mortgage or rental of a property in Ireland 
  * Bank statements relating to an Irish bank account 

You can [ claim tax relief if you buy private health insurance
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/money-and-tax/tax/income-tax-credits-
and-reliefs/taxation-and-medical-expenses/) or long-term care insurance. The
insurance company gives you this tax relief at source. This means they deduct
it from your premium.
