##  Introduction

If you are living in a local authority home and you want to move to a
different local authority home, you should ask your local authority if this is
possible.

Most local authorities will allow you to transfer to another local authority
home in the same area if you meet certain conditions. You may also be able to
swap homes with another local authority tenant, if the local authority agrees
to it.

If you want to move to a local authority home in a different local authority
area, you will have to arrange a swap with another local authority tenant
yourself. You must get approval from both local authorities and meet the
qualifying criteria to do this.
