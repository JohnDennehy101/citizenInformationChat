###  Can a Garda stop me randomly while in traffic and breathalyse me?

No. Road traffic law does not give the Gardaí the power to pull cars over
while in traffic and breathalyse the driver _randomly_ . It **only** gives the
Gardaí the power to conduct checkpoints for the purpose of **random breath
testing** .

A Garda has the right to stop any vehicle and, once stopped, they can
breathalyse you if the Garda has formed the opinion that you have committed
any road traffic offence, or that you have been involved in a road traffic
accident, or is of the opinion that you are intoxicated.
