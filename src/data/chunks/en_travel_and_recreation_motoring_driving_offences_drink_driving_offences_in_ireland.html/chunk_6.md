###  Administrative penalty system

If you hold a valid licence or permit at the time of the offence and your
alcohol level is below a certain limit, you will be issued with a fixed
penalty notice. If you pay the fine stated on the notice within 28 days, the
additional penalty stated on the notice will be imposed but you will not have
to go to court. You are not eligible for a drink driving fixed penalty notice
if you have received a similar notice within the previous 3 years. The alcohol
limits and penalties applied under the fixed penalty notice scheme are as set
out below:
