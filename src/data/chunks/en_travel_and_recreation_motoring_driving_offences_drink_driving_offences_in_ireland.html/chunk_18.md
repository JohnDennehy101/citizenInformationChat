###  **Drug testing of drivers**

Drug testing devices test saliva for cannabis, cocaine, opiates (for example,
heroin and morphine) and benzodiazepines (for example, valium). It is an
offence to refuse to provide a saliva sample.

Gardaí have discretionary power to conduct preliminary drug tests at the
roadside under the Road Traffic Acts. Gardaí may also carry out an impairment
test.

In certain circumstances, you may be brought to a Garda station for a blood
sample.
