The court clerk in your local District Court will assist you with this
process. Alternatively, your solicitor can assist you. Appeals to the Circuit
Court to reverse a conviction for drink driving are free of charge.

If you have been disqualified from driving, [ you can apply
](https://courts.ie/restoring-driving-licence) for your driving licence to be
restored.

You make the application to the District Court where the order to disqualify
you was made. An application costs â‚¬55. You must be more than halfway through
your disqualification period before you can make an application.

Your driving licence will not be restored if:

  * The disqualification is for 2 years or less 
  * You have been given another disqualification in the past 10 years 

The court can reduce the period of disqualification to two-thirds of the
original period of disqualification or to 2 years, whichever is the greater.

When a court is considering an application for the restoration of a driving
licence it will look at the nature of the offence, the character of the
applicant and the conduct of the applicant after conviction.
