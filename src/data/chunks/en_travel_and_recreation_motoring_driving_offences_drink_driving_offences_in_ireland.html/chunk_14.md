###  What proof is needed in drink driving cases?

When a Garda decides to prosecute someone for drink driving they must provide
the court with certain proofs in order to obtain a conviction. The proofs
required under [ Section 4(2), (3) and (4) of the Road Traffic Act 2010
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2010/en/act/pub/0025/sec0004.html#sec4) (i.e.
blood, urine and breath test) are slightly different to that of Section 4(1)
(driving while under the influence of an intoxicant).

This charge is normally preferred where an arrested person has failed to
provide a blood, urine or breath specimen with the result that it is not
possible to bring a case under either Section 4(2), (3) or (4).

For an offence under Section 4(1) the following elements or proofs must be
given to the court:

  * That you drove or attempted to drive a mechanically propelled vehicle 
  * That your driving or attempt to drive took place in a public place 
  * That you were under the influence of an intoxicant to such a degree that you could not properly control the vehicle 

Normally the Garda will give evidence of their observations and the opinion
they formed as a result. Other Gardaí or doctors who dealt with the person
while in the Garda Station can also give evidence in support of this.

Other evidence that the Garda may give could include the defendants’ inability
to perform simple co-ordination tests when asked. For example, you were unable
to walk a straight line or unable to put the key into the door lock. Such
evidence will support the view that you were incapable of having proper
control of your vehicle.
