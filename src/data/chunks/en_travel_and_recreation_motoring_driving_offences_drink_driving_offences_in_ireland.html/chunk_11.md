###  Can the Gardaí set up a mandatory alcohol testing checkpoint anywhere?

Yes. Provided it is in a public place and is authorised by a Garda Inspector.
The reason the Gardaí have been given powers to set up these checkpoints is to
reduce accidents caused by drink driving in locations where they will have
most effect.

So, basically they can conduct checkpoints on main roads, outside pubs or
night clubs or anywhere else they feel will reduce the number of drink drivers
on the road. The Gardaí are however obliged to exercise these powers in a
proportional manner.
