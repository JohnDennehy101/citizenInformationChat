###  Mandatory alcohol testing

Mandatory _alcohol testing_ means _random breath testing_ . The Road Traffic
Act 2010 allows the Gardaí (in certain circumstances) to breathalyse the
drivers of vehicles without the need to have formed the opinion that the
driver had consumed alcohol.

However, the power can only be exercised at checkpoints which have been
authorised by a Garda Inspector. These checkpoints are specifically designed
for the purpose of mandatory alcohol testing. The authorisation must be given
by the Inspector in writing and allows Gardaí to set up a checkpoint in a
public place (or another place).

The Gardaí can stop any mechanically propelled vehicle (including motorcycles,
scooters, electric bicycles, wheelchairs, etc.) and may require the driver of
the vehicle to do the following:

  * Provide a specimen of their breath by exhaling into equipment used for indicating the presence of alcohol in the breath, or 
  * Provide a specimen of their saliva, or 
  * Accompany the Garda (or another Garda) to a place (including a vehicle) at or near the checkpoint to provide a breath or saliva specimen, or 
  * To leave the vehicle at the place where it has been stopped. 

Anyone who refuses or fails to comply immediately with the above or to comply
in the manner required by the Gardaí is guilty of an offence. The Garda may
ask the driver to move their vehicle to a place near the checkpoint and to
leave it there until they have complied with any requirement made of them.

The Gardaí may arrest (without warrant) anyone who in the opinion of the
Garda, is committing or _has_ committed an offence of failure or refusal to
comply with a request by the Garda.
