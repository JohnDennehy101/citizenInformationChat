###  Standard information

Any advertising of credit agreements that includes an interest rate or the
cost of the credit must include standard information. This is set out in the [
European Communities (Consumer Credit Agreements) Regulations 2010
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2010/si/281/made/en/print) .

This standard information must use a representative example and clearly show:

  * The borrowing rate (fixed or variable or both) and details of any charges included in the total [ cost of the credit ](http://www.consumerhelp.ie/choosing-a-loan#costofcredit) to the consumer 
  * The total amount of credit 
  * The annual percentage rate of charge (except in the case of an overdraft) 
  * The duration of the credit agreement (if applicable) 
  * If the credit is in the form of deferred payment for a specific good or service, the cash price and the amount of any advance payment 
  * The total amount that you are required to pay and the amount of the instalments (if applicable) 

For mortgages, if the loan will be secured on a residential property this must
be stated. A warning must be included if possible changes of the exchange rate
could affect the amount you pay.

If you are required to also agree to another service (such as insurance) to
get the credit agreement as advertised, and if the cost of this service is not
known in advance, this requirement must be stated clearly.
