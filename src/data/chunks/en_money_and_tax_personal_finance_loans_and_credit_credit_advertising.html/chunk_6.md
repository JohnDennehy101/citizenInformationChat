##  Moneylenders

[ Moneylending Regulations
](https://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2020/si/196/made/en/print) introduced in
2020 restrict how licensed moneylenders can offer and promote loans.
Advertisements by moneylenders must be fair and not be misleading.

They must be clearly presented and be clear about the type of service being
advertised.

If the loan is a high-cost product, advertisements must include a clear
warning and prompt you to consider alternative loans from other lenders.

For loans under €200, the requirements set out above in ‘Standard information’
apply.
