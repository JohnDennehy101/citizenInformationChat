it also allows them to seize any evidence that a fireworks offence has been
committed. The Gardaí can demand the name and address of anyone present at the
premises when they are searching it.

arrested. If found guilty in court, you may be liable on summary conviction to
a [ class C fine ](/en/justice/criminal-law/criminal-trial/fines-for-criminal-
offences/) or to a prison sentence of up to 6 months, or to both.
