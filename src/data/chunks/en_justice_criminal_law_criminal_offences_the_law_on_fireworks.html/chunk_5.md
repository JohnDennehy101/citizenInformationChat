###  More dangerous fireworks

Fireworks in other categories are more dangerous and can only be used by
professional operators in organised displays, not by the general public.

These fireworks include rockets, roman candles and aerial wheels. If you want
to organise a display of these types of firework, you must use a professional
fireworks operator.
