##  Applying in person

Applying in person to the Passport Office for your child’s first passport is
not recommended. Nearly all Irish citizens, including children, can apply for
their first passport online.

The counter service in the Passport Office is designed to accommodate people
who need to [ renew their passports urgently
](https://www.ireland.ie/en/dfa/passports/urgent-appointment/) , and don’t
have enough time to apply in other ways. It should not be used for first time
applications. These applications are too complex to process at the public
counter because your right to Irish citizenship must be established and your
documents must be verified. You should not book any travel until you have
received your child’s passport as these applications cannot be expedited.

If you are living in a country where Post Passport or Passport Online are not
available, you can apply for an Irish passport in person or using ordinary or
registered post to your [ nearest Irish embassy or consulate
](https://www.ireland.ie/en/dfa/embassies/) . You use form APS 2.

You cannot download the application form. You can get the application form
from the Irish embassy or consulate in the country where you live (or the
closest embassy or consulate).
