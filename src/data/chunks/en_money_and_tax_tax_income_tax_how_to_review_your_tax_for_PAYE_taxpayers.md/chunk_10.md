####  How do I qualify for an exemption from using Revenue’s online services?

You may qualify for an exemption if you do not have the capacity to make
returns and payments online.

Revenue may grant you an exemption if:

  * Your internet access is insufficient or 
  * You cannot file online because of age or a mental or physical disability 

If you want to apply for an exemption, you write to your local tax office to
state why you are unable to file online. You should write ‘Exclusion request’
on the envelope.

If Revenue refuses this request, you can appeal the decision. To do this, you
must complete a [ Notice of Appeal form (pdf)
](http://www.taxappeals.ie/_fileupload/Forms/Notice of Appeal Form.pdf) and
send it to the [ Tax Appeals Commission (TAC) ](http://www.taxappeals.ie/) .
