####  **Refuse and water charges**

In some local authority areas, low-income households can avail of a waiver
(that is, a reduction or total exemption) on waste and water charges made by
private operators and by local authorities. These waivers vary greatly from
region to region and, in some areas, they are not available at all. To find
out if your local authority operates a waiver scheme, you should contact them
directly.
