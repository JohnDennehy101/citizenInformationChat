####  **Free travel**

If you are over the age of 66 or getting a carers' or certain other social

at any time on bus, road, rail and DART services operated by Bus Átha Cliath,
Bus Éireann, Iarnród Éireann, LUAS services, the Aran Islands ferry service
and on certain private services which have opted into the scheme.

You can also use your Free Travel Pass on any of the 34 schemes under the
Rural Transport Initiative. People who are entitled to free travel are also
entitled to have their spouse/partner travel free with them or may be entitled
to a Companion Pass on medical grounds. The [ Free Travel Scheme ](/en/social-
welfare/extra-social-welfare-benefits/free-travel/) also covers public
transport services in Northern Ireland for people over 66 years of age who
have a Senior SmartPass Card.
