##  Introduction

If you are renting your home from a local authority, you have certain
responsibilities. For example, you must pay the rent on time and not engage in
anti-social behaviour.

If you don’t keep these responsibilities, you may end up [ losing your home
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/housing/local-authority-and-social-
housing/repossession-of-rented-social-housing/) . If you are affected by anti-
social behaviour, you should call the Gardaí to report it, and contact your
local authority.

If you are having trouble paying rent, you should contact your local authority
immediately so you can try and find a solution.
