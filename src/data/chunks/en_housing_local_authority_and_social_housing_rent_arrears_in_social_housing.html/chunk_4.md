##  What if someone in my household is engaging in anti-social behaviour?

You can apply for an excluding order against a member of your household who is
engaging in anti-social behaviour. An excluding order is a legal order that
can prevent someone from going somewhere or from having contact with someone.
The order may:

  * Exclude the person from a specific home or from an entire estate 
  * Forbid the person from intimidating, harassing or interfering with you or anyone else 

It may be difficult for you to do this if you are the victim of the anti-
social behaviour. So, the local authority or [ approved housing body
](/en/housing/local-authority-and-social-housing/approved-housing-bodies/) can
apply to the [ District Court ](/en/justice/courts-system/district-court/) for
an excluding order against any member of your household who is engaging in
anti-social behaviour.
