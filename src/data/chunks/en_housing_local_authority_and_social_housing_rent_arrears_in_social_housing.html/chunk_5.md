##  What are the consequences of anti-social behaviour in social housing?

Local authorities can [ evict you for anti-social behaviour
](/en/housing/local-authority-and-social-housing/repossession-of-rented-
social-housing/) .

Your local authority should send you a tenancy warning notice about the anti-
social behaviour, before it begins the process to repossess your home.
However, they may not need to issue a tenancy warning if there is very serious
anti-social behaviour. You can ask for a review of the tenancy warning.

If you don’t deal with the anti-social behaviour, the local authority can
begin the proceedings to take possession of your home.

If you are evicted, excluded or removed from local authority housing because
of anti-social behaviour:

  * You may not be accepted on any [ local authority housing list ](/en/housing/local-authority-and-social-housing/social-housing-waiting-lists/) again 
  * You may not be allowed to [ buy your local authority home under a Tenant Purchase Scheme ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/housing/local-authority-and-social-housing/buying-or-inheriting-a-local-authority-home/#d25023)
  * The Department of Social Protection may refuse or withdraw [ Rent Supplement ](/en/social-welfare/supplementary-welfare-schemes/rent-supplement/) for a private rented property 

If you’ve received a tenancy warning, exclusion order or repossession order,
you should get legal advice.
