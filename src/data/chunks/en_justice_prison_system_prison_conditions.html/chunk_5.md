###  Hygiene, clothing and bedding

You do not have to wear a uniform but are supplied with a range of clothing.
Changes of underclothing are supplied to all prisoners. You may, at the
discretion of the Governor, be permitted to wear your own clothing provided it
is kept clean and is sufficient to keep you warm and healthy.

All prisoners are entitled to wash daily and shower at least once per week.
Cell bedding must be adequate for warmth and health and you should not be
required to sleep without a mattress.

Adequate sanitary and washing facilities should generally be provided your
cell or room. Where this is not possible, a prisoner must have reasonable
access to sanitary and washing facilities.
