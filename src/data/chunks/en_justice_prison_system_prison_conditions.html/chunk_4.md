###  Diet

You should receive a healthy, well-balanced and reasonably varied diet. If you
are a member of a particular religion or culture, or if a doctor recommends
that you follow a special diet for medical reasons, the Governor will try, as
far as possible, to accommodate your dietary requirements.
