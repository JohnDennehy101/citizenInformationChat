###  Letters

Prisoners are entitled to send letters to their family or friends and there is
no limit to the number of letters that may be received from them.

A prisoner on remand can also send as many letters as is necessary to manage
their property or business affairs. A prisoner who sends more than 7 letters
during a week may be required to pay for postage and writing materials in
respect of the extra letters.

All incoming and outgoing mail may be opened and checked by a prison officer
with the exception of legal correspondence, which can be opened in the
presence of the prisoner to confirm its status and then placed back into the
envelope. The Governor may also suspend your entitlement to send some types of
letters for a period of up to 60-days as punishment for a breach of prison
discipline (see ‘Discipline and correction’ below).
