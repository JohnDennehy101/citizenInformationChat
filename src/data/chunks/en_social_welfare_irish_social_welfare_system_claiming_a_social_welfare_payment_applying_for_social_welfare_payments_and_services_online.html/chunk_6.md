##  Setting up a verified MyGovID account

A [ verified MyGovID account ](https://www.mygovid.ie/en-IE/HowDoISignUp) is
more secure than a basic account. It lets you access all available services.

You can upgrade from a basic account to a verified MyGovID account at [
MyGovID.ie ](https://www.mygovid.ie/) or you can download the [ MyGovID app
](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/f61b1-mygovid-app/) onto your smartphone.

To upgrade from a basic account to a verified MyGovID, you need:

  * A [ Personal Public Service (PPS) number ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/personal-public-service-number/)
  * A [ Public Services Card (PSC) ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/public-services-card/) , and 
  * A verified mobile phone that can receive text messages. If your phone is not yet verified by the Department of Social Protection, you can call them on 0818 927 999. 

If you do not have a PSC, you can apply:

  * Using the [ MyGovID app ](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/f61b1-mygovid-app/)
  * [ In-person ](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/fd52ab-public-services-card/#your-safe-registration-appointment) at a [ PSC Centre ](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/be29c7-psc-online-registration-centres/)

If you do not have a PPS number, you will need to apply for your PPS number at
a designated [ PPS Number Allocation Centre
](http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/Personal-Public-Service-Number-Registration-
Centres-by-Count.aspx) .

Every time you access your verified MyGovID account, you will be asked to
enter a verification code which has been sent to your mobile phone. This
2-step authentication process makes your account more secure.

Once you have a verified account, you can apply for social welfare payments
online. In some cases, you must be invited by the Department of Social
Protection to apply online.
