##  What is full-time care?

To get Carer’s Benefit, you must be providing full-time care to a person who
needs full-time care.

A person is seen as needing full-time care when:

  * They need continual supervision to avoid danger to themselves 

Or

  * They need continual supervision and frequent assistance throughout the day with normal bodily functions. For example, help to walk and get about, eat or drink, get washed or dressed. 

The Department of Social Protection will decide if the person needs full-time
care.

The person being cared for must have their doctor complete, sign and stamp the
Medical Report which is part of the Carer’s Benefit application form – see
‘How to apply for Carer's Benefit’ below.

This Medical Report is not needed if the person being cared for is a child who
is getting [ Domiciliary Care Allowance ](/en/social-welfare/disability-and-
illness/domiciliary-care-allowance/) . You may get Carer’s Benefit even if you
are not the person getting the Domiciliary Care Allowance for the child.
