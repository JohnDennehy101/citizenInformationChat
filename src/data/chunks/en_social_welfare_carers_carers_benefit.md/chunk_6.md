###  PRSI contribution conditions

To get Carer’s Benefit, you must have at least 156 contributions paid at any
time since you first started work (entered into the social insurance PRSI
system). You must also have:

  * 39 contributions paid in the relevant tax year, **or**
  * 39 contributions paid in the 12-month period before the start of Carer's Benefit, **or**
  * 26 contributions paid in the relevant tax year and 26 contributions paid in the year before that. 

The relevant tax year is the second last complete tax year before the year in
which you make your claim for Carer’s Benefit. So, for claims made in 2024,
the relevant tax year is 2022.

Only contributions at Class A, B, C, D, H and E are counted towards Carer's
Benefit. Class S (self-employed contributions) do not count.

Social insurance in another EU member state and the UK may be used to meet the
PRSI contribution rules. Your last week social insurance contribution must be
paid in Ireland.

You are awarded [ credited contributions ](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-
welfare-system/social-insurance-prsi/credited-social-insurance-contributions/)
or _credits_ automatically when you are getting Carer's Benefit. Credits are
awarded at the same rate as your last paid contribution. These credits help
protect your future entitlement to social welfare benefits and pensions.
