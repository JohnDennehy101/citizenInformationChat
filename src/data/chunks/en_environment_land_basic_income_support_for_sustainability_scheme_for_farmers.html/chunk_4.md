##  How does the BISS scheme work?

You get [ payment entitlements
](https://control.citizensinformation.ie/en/environment/land/basic-income-
support-for-sustainability-scheme-for-farmers/#d8d011) based on the amount of
land you farm. You claim these entitlements to get financial support.

To qualify, you need to have at least one eligible hectare of land.

Eligible hectares are automatically calculated using the best imagery
available and are displayed on the BISS online system. You do not have to
manually calculate the number of eligible hectares you have.
