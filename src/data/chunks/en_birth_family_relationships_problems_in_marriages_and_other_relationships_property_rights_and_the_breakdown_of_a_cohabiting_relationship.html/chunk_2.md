##  Introduction

When a relationship ends, you may have questions about your property rights,
including ‘ _who gets the house_ ,’ and ‘ _what about the children?_ ’

This is a complex area of law, and the answers to these questions depend on a
range of factors, including:

  * Your _marital status_ (whether you are married or not married) 
  * Whether you and your partner can agree on the terms of your break-up 
  * Whether one name, or both names, are on the title deeds to the house 
  * Whether there are any children and if they need to be provided for 

This page explains your property rights depending on your personal situation.
