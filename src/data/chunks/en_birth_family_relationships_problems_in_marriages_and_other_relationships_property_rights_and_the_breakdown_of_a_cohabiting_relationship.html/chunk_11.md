###  What if there are children involved?

If there are children involved, a relationship breakdown can be life-altering.
It needs to be handled sensitively to ensure the childrenâ€™s best interests are
prioritised.

Often, if a married couple with children are separating, the person who looks
after the children the majority of the time will get to stay in the family
home until the youngest child reaches 18 years old (or 23 if they are in full-
time education).

Dependent children of civil partners are protected in a similar way under the
[ Children and Family Relationships Act 2015
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2015/act/9/enacted/en/html) .

If the parents cannot agree who the child will live with, the court can make
orders in relation to [ custody and access ](/en/birth-family-
relationships/separation-and-divorce/separation-and-divorce-children/) .
