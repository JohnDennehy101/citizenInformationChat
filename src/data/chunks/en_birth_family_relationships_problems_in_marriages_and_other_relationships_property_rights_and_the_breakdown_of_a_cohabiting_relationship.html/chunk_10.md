###  Cohabitation agreements

The Act also provides for couples to enter into a "cohabitation agreement" to
set out your financial interests and also determine what will happen with
certain assets, such as property, if your relationship should end.

A cohabitant’s agreement can make things more straightforward in the event of
a break-up. A court may _vary_ (change aspects of) or _set aside_ a
cohabitants’ agreement in exceptional circumstances where enforcing it would
cause serious injustice.
