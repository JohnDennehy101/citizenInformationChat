##  Passenger Name Record Directive

The Passenger Name Record Directive (PNRD) ( [ Directive 2016/681
](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/dir/2016/681/oj) ) regulates the use of
passenger name record (PNR) data in the EU for the prevention, detection,
investigation and prosecution of terrorist offences and serious crimes.

PNR data is personal information provided by passengers and collected and held
by airlines. It includes:

  * Travel dates 
  * Travel itinerary 
  * Ticket information 
  * Contact details 
  * Means of payment used 
  * Baggage information 

Each EU member state has a Passenger Information Unit (PIU), which is
responsible for collecting, storing and processing PNR data, as well as
transferring that data or the results of its processing to the appropriate
national authorities in other member states and [ Europol
](https://www.europol.europa.eu/) . The Irish PIU operates the remit of the [
Department of Justice ](http://www.justice.ie/) .

Airlines must provide PIUs in EU member states with the PNR data for flights
entering or departing from the EU. The Directive also allows, but does not
require, EU member states to collect PNR data concerning selected internal EU
flights.

Data provided by airlines will be stored in a database by a PIU for 5 years.
After 6 monthsâ€™ storage, the PNR data must be de-personalised so the data
subject is no longer immediately identifiable.

The data collected may only be processed to prevent, detect, investigate and
prosecute terrorist offences and serious crime. Serious crimes include murder,
serious assaults, participation in a criminal organisation, human and drug
trafficking and the sexual exploitation of children.

Data should only be processed in the following cases:

  * For a pre-arrival assessment of passengers against pre-determined risk criteria 
  * For use in specific investigations or prosecutions 
  * As input in the development of risk assessment criteria 

The [ EU (PNR Data) Regulations 2018
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2018/si/177/made/en/print) have
transposed the PNRD into Irish law.
