##  Law Enforcement Directive

The Law Enforcement Directive ( [ Directive 2016/680 ](https://eur-
lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32016L0680) ) specifically
regulates the processing of data by police and criminal justice authorities in
the EU, such as An Garda Síochána. The Directive requires the data collected
by law enforcement authorities to be:

  * Processed lawfully and fairly 
  * Collected for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes and processed only in line with these purposes 
  * Adequate, relevant and not excessive in relation to the purpose in which it is processed 
  * Accurate and updated where necessary 
  * Kept in a form that allows identification of the individual for no longer than is necessary for the purpose of the processing 
  * Appropriately secured, including protection against unauthorised or unlawful processing 

The Directive requires that the law enforcement authorities make a clear
distinction between the data of different categories of persons such as:

  * Suspected offenders 
  * Convicted offenders 
  * Victims 
  * Other witnesses 

National authorities must implement measures to ensure a level of security for
personal data, for example, preventing unauthorised persons access processing
equipment; preventing the unauthorised reading, copying, changing or removal
of data; and preventing the unauthorised input, viewing, changing or deleting
of stored personal data.

Data subjects have similar rights under the Law Enforcement Directive as they
have under the GDPR, such as rights to information, access, rectifying
incorrect information, erasure and to be notified of data breaches.

However, there is greater scope for these rights to be limited than under the
GDPR. These rights may be restricted, if proportionate and necessary, to

  * Avoid obstructing official or legal investigations or procedures 
  * Avoid prejudicing the prevention, detection, investigation or prosecution of criminal offences or the execution of criminal penalties 
  * Protect public or national security 
  * Protect the rights and freedoms of other persons.
