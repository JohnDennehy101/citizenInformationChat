##  Introduction

Some uses of personal data fall outside the [ General Data Protection
Regulation (GDPR) ](/en/government-in-ireland/data-protection/overview-of-
general-data-protection-regulation/) and are governed by separate pieces of
legislation.

For example, the Law Enforcement Directive establishes data protection
standards in the area of criminal offences and penalties. Unless a data
protection issue falls clearly under the terms of the Law Enforcement
Directive, it will be governed by the GDPR. The Law Enforcement Directive is
implemented into Irish law through the [ Data Protection Act 2018
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2018/act/7/enacted/en/html) .

Another area where there are a specific set of rules is in relation to the
processing of airline passenger data to prevent and prosecute serious crimes
and terrorism. This is governed by the Passenger Name Record Directive and the
[ European Union (Passenger Name Record Data) Regulations 2018
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2018/si/177/made/en/print) .
