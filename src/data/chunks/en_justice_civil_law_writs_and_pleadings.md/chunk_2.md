##  Information

Pleadings (sometimes called _writs_ ) are court documents that are exchanged
by the parties in a case. If the case is a [ High Court ](/en/justice/courts-
system/high-court/) or [ Circuit Court ](/en/justice/courts-system/circuit-
court/) case, the [ solicitor ](/en/justice/courtroom/solicitors/) will
usually appoint a [ barrister ](/en/justice/courtroom/barristers/) to draft
the pleadings in the case.

The person who is bringing the case, that is, the person who is suing, is
known as the _plaintiff_ or _claimant_ . The person who is being sued is known
as the _defendant_ or _respondent_ .

If you receive a writ or pleading that was sent to you in error, you should
contact the solicitor whose name appears on the document.
