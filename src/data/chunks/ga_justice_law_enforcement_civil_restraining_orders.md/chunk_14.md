###  **What happens at the District Court?**

The District Court can only hear the application when the person accused has
been informed of the application.

Before the District Court issues a civil restraining order, it must be
satisfied that:

  * The person accused has behaved in a wrongful way (engaged in relevant conduct) 
  * The order is necessary and proportionate to protect your safety and welfare
