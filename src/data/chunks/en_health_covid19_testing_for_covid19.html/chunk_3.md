##  Do I need a COVID-19 test?

You do not need to get a COVID-19 test unless your GP or a healthcare worker
in a hospital advises you to be tested. They will then arrange a test for you.

You should contact your GP if you have symptoms of COVID-19 and an [
underlying condition which puts you at higher risk of severe illness from
COVID-19 ](https://www2.hse.ie/conditions/covid19/people-at-higher-

You can buy antigen tests in most pharmacies and many supermarkets if you wish
to take a test.
