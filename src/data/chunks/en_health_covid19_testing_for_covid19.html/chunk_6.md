###  Getting a PCR test with a GP

Your GP will no longer refer you to a PCR test centre.

If you are a vulnerable patient, your GP may test you for COVID-19 at their
clinic. If you have a [ medical card ](/en/health/medical-cards-and-gp-visit-
cards/medical-card/) or [ GP visit card ](/en/health/medical-cards-and-gp-
visit-cards/gp-visit-cards/) this will be free. If you are a private patient,
you will have to pay a fee.

If you have symptoms of COVID-19 do not go to the GP clinic. You should phone
your GP if your breathing changes or becomes difficult, or your cough gets
worse.
