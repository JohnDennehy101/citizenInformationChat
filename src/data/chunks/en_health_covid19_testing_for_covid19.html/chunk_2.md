##  Introduction

There are two ways to test for COVID-19:

  * PCR tests are done by a healthcare worker in a hospital, your GP or a private company. They send your sample to a lab where it is tested for COVID-19. 
  * Antigen tests are tests you can do yourself at home. The test sample does not have to go to a lab and you usually get your results in 15 minutes. Antigen tests are quicker but less reliable than a PCR test. In some cases, they may not detect the virus. You can buy antigen tests in pharmacies and supermarkets. 

You can no longer book a PCR test or order antigen test online through the
HSE.
