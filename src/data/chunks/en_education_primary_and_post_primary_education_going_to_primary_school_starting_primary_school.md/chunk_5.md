##  Resolving problems at school

If your child has a problem that you cannot sort out, you can arrange to speak
to the class teacher. If this doesn't resolve the problem you can speak to the
school principal.

If you have a complaint about a teacher or about the school, the first step is
usually to speak to the class teacher. Then, if the complaint is not resolved,
you can speak to the school principal. The next step is to approach the
chairperson of the school's board of management.

If you have exhausted the school's complaints procedure and are still not
satisfied, you can appeal to the Ombudsman for Children.

If your [ complaint is about a teacher’s fitness to teach
](http://www.teachingcouncil.ie/en/Professional-Standards/Complaints-about-
Registered-Teachers/) , you should first use the school’s complaints
procedure. If you have exhausted this procedure and are not satisfied with the
outcome, you can [ make a complaint to the Teaching Council
](http://www.teachingcouncil.ie/en/Professional-Standards/Complaints-about-
Registered-Teachers/Making-a-Complaint/) .

The Department of Education has no legal powers to investigate individual
complaints about schools or to instruct schools to follow a particular course
of direction with regard to individual complaints. The Department provides
information on the [ complaints procedure in primary school
](https://www.gov.ie/en/policy-information/complaints-about-schools/#parental-
complaints) .
