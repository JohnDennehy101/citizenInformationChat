##  Enrolling your child at primary school

You can send your child to the primary school of your choice, provided there
is a place available for them. Where there is a shortage of places the school
must give priority based on their admissions or enrolment policy. This is
drawn up by the [ board of management ](/en/education/primary-and-post-
primary-education/going-to-primary-school/boards-of-management/) and should be
available to you on request. You can find out more about [ different types of
primary schools ](/en/education/primary-and-post-primary-education/going-to-
primary-school/choosing-a-primary-school/) and their [ admissions policies
](/en/education/the-irish-education-system/admissions-policies-in-primary-and-
secondary-schools/) .

**Finding a place**

To enrol your child in primary school, [ check the list of primary schools in
your area ](https://www.gov.ie/en/service/find-a-school/) . You should contact
the school of your choice to see if there is a place available. The school of
your choice may place your child on a waiting list or you may need to contact
other schools to find a place.

[ Children with special educational needs ](/en/education/special-education-
needs/special-needs-education-primary-schools/) are generally educated in
mainstream schools. Though there are some special schools.
