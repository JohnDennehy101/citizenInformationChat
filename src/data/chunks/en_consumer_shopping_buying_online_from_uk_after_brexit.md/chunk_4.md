##  Taxes and other charges

From 1 January 2021, you may have to pay taxes and duties such as [ customs
duty ](https://revenue.ie/en/customs/individuals/buying-online-
personal/outside-eu.aspx) and [ VAT ](/en/money-and-tax/tax/duties-and-
vat/value-added-tax/) when you buy from a UK business (except Northern
Ireland). Whether or not you must pay additional charges depends on the value
and origin of the products you bought - see table below.

The EU and UK have agreed a [ Trade and Cooperation Agreement
](https://commission.europa.eu/strategy-and-policy/relations-non-eu-
countries/relations-united-kingdom/eu-uk-trade-and-cooperation-agreement_en)
(the Brexit Trade Deal) that covers customs charges when buying online from
the UK. However, the deal only applies to products coming into Ireland **that
are made in the UK** . This means you may still have to pay customs duty on
some items bought online in the UK and delivered to Ireland.

The Brexit Trade Deal does not impact on VAT. You may have to pay VAT on
purchases from the UK from 1 January 2021.

Find out what VAT and import charges you will have to pay before ordering from
a UK site. The table below is a guide, however if you are not sure check with
the retailer before you buy.

**Note:** the value limits below are for the whole delivery, not just one
item.
