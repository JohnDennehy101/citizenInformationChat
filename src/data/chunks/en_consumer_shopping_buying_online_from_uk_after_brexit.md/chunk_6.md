###  If you return the item

If you return an item, you may be able to get a refund of any Customs Duty and
VAT you paid.

How you apply for a refund depends on how you paid the charges.

  1. **You paid directly to the retailer at point of sale** : you will usually apply for and receive these as part of your overall refund from the retailer. 
  2. **You paid to the postal service or courier company on delivery** : you should apply to the postal service or courier company directly for a refund. 

Remember to keep proof that you returned the item.
