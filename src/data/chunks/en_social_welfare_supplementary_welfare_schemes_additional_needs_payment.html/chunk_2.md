##  What is the Additional Needs Payment?

The Additional Needs Payment is a payment to help you with an expense that you
cannot pay from your weekly income.

You may get an Additional Needs Payment if you are:

  * Getting a social welfare payment, or 
  * Working and on a low income, regardless of the number of hours that you work 

You may get this payment even if you are not getting a social welfare payment.

When you apply for the payment, your income and circumstances will be assessed
to find out if you qualify.

The Additional Needs Payment includes the _Exceptional Needs_ and _Urgent
Needs_ payments.
