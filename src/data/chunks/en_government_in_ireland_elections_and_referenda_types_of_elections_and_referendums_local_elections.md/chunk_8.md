###  Candidate spending limit

Candidates are allowed to spend a limited amount of money on the local
election campaign. This amount varies depending on the population size of the
local electorate area.

**Local electoral area** |  **Candidate spending limit**  
---|---  
Population over 35,000  |  €15,350   
Population between 18,001 and 35,000  |  €13,600   
Population of 18,000 or less  |  €11,500   
  
Candidates must disclose how much they spent to the local authority within 90
days after polling day. The Minister sets the start date of the campaign
spending period, which must be between 50 and 60 days before polling day.
