##  Introduction

You dispose of an asset when you:

  * Sell it 
  * Give it as a gift 
  * Exchange it 
  * Get compensation or insurance for it 

If you make a profit or gain when you dispose of an asset, you pay Capital
Gains Tax (CGT) on the chargeable gain.

The chargeable gain is usually the difference between the price you paid for
the asset and the price you got when you disposed of it. You can deduct
allowable expenses such as the cost of acquiring and disposing of the asset.

When you dispose of an asset, you must file a tax return for CGT by 31 October
of the following year.

When you dispose of an asset, you must:

  * Pay Capital Gains Tax by 15 December of the same year (for a disposal in December the deadline is 31 January) 
  * File a tax return for CGT by 31 October of the following year
