###  After a death

There is no Capital Gains Tax on assets that are passed on death. The assets
are treated as if the person who died got the assets at the same value they
have on the date of death.

If a personal representative disposes of the assets, they are responsible for
any gains between the date of the personâ€™s death and the date of disposal.
