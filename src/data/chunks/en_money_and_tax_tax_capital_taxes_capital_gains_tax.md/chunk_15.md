##  How to file a tax return for capital gains

You must file a tax return for all disposals.

When you dispose of an asset, you must file a return by 31 October of the
following year.

For example, if you dispose of an asset between 1 January and 30 November,
payment is due by 15 December. Your return will be due by 31 October of the
next year.
