##  Party structures

A party structure is any structure that divides separately owned buildings, or
is situated at a boundary line or so close to a boundary line that you could
not carry out works to the structure without access to the adjoining structure
or land.

A party structure can be a wall, arch, ceiling, floor, partition, ditch,
fence, hedge, shrub, tree or any other structure.
