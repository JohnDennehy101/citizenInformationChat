###  Utility companies

Electricity and telecommunications companies have various rights to cut down
or lop trees that are on private property that may obstruct wires, under the
Electricity (Supply) Act 1927. They must give seven daysâ€™ notice to the
landowner of their intention to do this. You may choose to have the work done
yourself. If you do, you must notify the company within seven days, and the
utility provider must pay the costs involved.
