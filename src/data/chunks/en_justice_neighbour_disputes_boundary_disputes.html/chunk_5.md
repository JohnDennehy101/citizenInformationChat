###  If your neighbour does not consent to works

You can apply to the District Court for a works order. A works order may:

  * Authorise you, or people authorised by you, to enter your neighbourâ€™s building or land for any purpose connected with the works 
  * Require you to indemnify or give security to your neighbour for damages, costs and expenses caused by or arising from the works or likely to be caused or to arise 

The procedure for getting a works order is set out in [ Order 93A of the
District Court Rules ](https://www.courts.ie/rules/applications-under-land-
and-conveyancing-law-reform-act-2009-si-no-162-2010) . You must notify your
neighbour of your intention to apply for a works order. The required form is
available from the District Court clerk. There are also forms available for an
application to the District Court for damage to be made good and for
applications to modify or discharge (cancel) a works order. The other party
must be notified in these cases as well.
