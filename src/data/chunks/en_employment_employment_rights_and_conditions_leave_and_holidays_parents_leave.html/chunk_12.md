###  Can my employer refuse my application for parent’s leave?

Your employer can only refuse parent’s leave if you are not entitled to it.

Your employer can postpone your parent’s leave once for up to 12 weeks. Your
employer could postpone your leave for the following reasons:

  * Seasonal variations in the volume of work 
  * No replacement to carry out your work 
  * The nature of your duties 
  * The number of other employees also taking parent’s leave 
  * Any other relevant matters that mean your parent’s leave would have a ‘substantial adverse effect on the operation of their business, profession or occupation’ 

Your employer must give you written notice that your parent’s leave will be
postponed. They must do this at least 4 weeks before the leave was due to
start. The notice must explain the reasons why they are postponing your
parent’s leave. The new start date for your parent’s leave must be agreed by
both you and your employer.
