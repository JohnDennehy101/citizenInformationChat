####  If a postponement of my parent’s leave takes me past the 2 year
eligibility period

The eligibility period for parent’s leave (up to a child’s 2nd birthday) can
only be extended for up to a maximum of 12 weeks in circumstances where an
employer has rejected the original dates within the 2 year period for business
reasons.

When making an application for parent’s leave and Parent's Benefit for dates
outside of the 2 year eligibility period, you must submit supporting
documentation to include confirmation from your employer detailing the reason
for the rejection of the original dates, and confirming your employer has
agreed the revised dates with you.
