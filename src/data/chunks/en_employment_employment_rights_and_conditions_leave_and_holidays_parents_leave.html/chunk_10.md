###  Can I share my parent's leave with my partner?

Both parents have an equal separate entitlement to parent’s leave. You cannot
transfer your entitlement to your partner.

Where one parent dies, the surviving parent is entitled to leave for the
amount of leave the deceased parent did not take from their 9 week entitlement
(this is known as _transferred parent’s leave_ ).
