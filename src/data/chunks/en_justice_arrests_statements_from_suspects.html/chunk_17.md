###  **Getting a copy of my statement**

If you make a statement to the Gardaí, you are entitled to a copy of the
statement free of charge. If you engage a solicitor after making your
statement, then your solicitor is entitled to a copy of the statement free of
charge.

If another person has been charged with the same offence and their statement
was taken separately, the Gardaí should not read this statement to you. You
should, however, be given a copy of that statement and the Gardaí should say
nothing that would invite a reply.
