##  Giving statements and confessions

The rules covering the taking of statements from suspects are called the
_Judges’ Rules_ .

The 9 Judge’s Rules are a guide for the Gardaí when investigating a crime to
ensure that suspects are treated fairly. The rules seek to ensure that any
suspect making a statement to the Gardaí is informed of their right to silence
by way of the caution.

Any statement taken from a suspect, in a way which breaks these rules, is
likely not to be allowed as evidence by a judge conducting a criminal trial.
