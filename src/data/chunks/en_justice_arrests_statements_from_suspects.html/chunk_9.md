###  **How does the court know if a statement is involuntary?**

The courts typically consider:

  * Were the words used by the person in authority, objectively viewed, capable of being a threat or inducement? 
  * Did the accused understand them as a threat or inducement? 
  * Was the statement the result of a threat or inducement? 

All three questions must be answered yes for the statement of confession to be
considered involuntary.
