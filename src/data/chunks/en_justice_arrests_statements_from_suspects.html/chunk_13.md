###  **Writing the statement**

The contents of the statement are then written down, either by you or by the
Gardaí. Normally this is done by the Gardaí, but you are allowed to write the
statement if you wish.

When you are finished making your written statement, the Gardaí either read
out the statement to you or invite you to read the statement yourself.
