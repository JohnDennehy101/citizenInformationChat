###  **Right to be cautioned**

A statement is anything a suspect says about a possible offence being
investigated. Often statements are written down and are then signed by a
suspect.

The following words must be spoken by the [ Gardaí (Irish police)
](/en/justice/law-enforcement/garda-siochana-national-police-force/) before
they can take a statement from a suspect:

“You are not obliged to say anything unless you wish to do so, but anything
you say will be taken down in writing and may be given in evidence.”

This is known as the _caution_ . It means that you are informed that there is
no legal obligation on you to say anything or to make a statement.

If you make a statement to the Gardaí and the Garda gave you a caution before
the statement was taken, then the contents of the statement can be used in a
court case or trial.
