##  Will my treatment system be inspected?

Your waste water treatment system can be inspected by the local authority.
Your local authority will write to you and let you know that they will be
inspecting your system. They will give you at least 10 working days’ notice
before the inspection.

If your waste water system is going to be inspected, you should:

  * Have your waste water systems registration certificate 
  * Know where your waste water treatment system is 
  * Have any paperwork about your system’s installation or maintenance 

Inspectors are appointed by the [ Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
](https://www.epa.ie/licensing/watwaste/wwda/) and must show you their
identification if you ask for it.

If your treatment system is working properly, you will get a certificate that
confirms this. If the inspector finds issues with your system, you will get an
advisory notice within 21 days of the inspection. This notice will outline the
problems with your system and give you a certain amount of time to fix them.
You may be able to get a grant to repair or upgrade your system (see below).
