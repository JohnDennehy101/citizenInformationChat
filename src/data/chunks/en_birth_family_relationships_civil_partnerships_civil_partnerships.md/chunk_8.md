###  *Living apart

The [ Family Law Act 2019 (pdf)
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2019/act/37/enacted/en/pdf) provides a
definition of ‘living apart’ to give certainty to the interpretation of the
term in the Irish courts. It clarifies that civil partners who live in the
same home as one another are considered to be living apart if they are not
living together as a couple in an intimate and committed relationship. The Act
also sets out that a relationship does not cease to be an intimate
relationship merely because the relationship is no longer sexual in nature.
