##  Introduction

If you are getting certain disability payments you may be allowed to work or
attend training and keep your payment. People getting Illness Benefit and
Invalidity Pension cannot work (except for unpaid voluntary work). They must
transfer to the [ Partial Capacity Benefit ](/en/social-welfare/disability-
and-illness/partial-capacity-benefit/) scheme if they wish to work.

If you are getting a means-tested payment, your income from work will be
assessed in the means test. However, some of your income from work is not
assessed.

The Department of Social Protection (DSP) has produced a [ Benefit of Work
Estimator ](https://www.mywelfare.ie/BenefitOfWorkDAestimator) tool on
welfare.ie for people getting Disability Allowance, Blind Pension, Invalidity
Pension or Illness Benefit. This can help you to assess the financial
consequences of taking up work or claiming Partial Capacity Benefit.
