###  Occupational Injuries Benefit Scheme and rehabilitative work

**Injury Benefit** is one of the benefits available under the [ Occupational
Injuries Scheme ](/en/social-welfare/disability-and-illness/occupational-
injuries-benefit-overview/) . If you are getting Injury Benefit you can do
light voluntary work. You can also do part-time work which is part of a
treatment or charitable in character (provided you do not earn more than €50 a
week) without permission. However, if you wish to do other rehabilitative work
or a training course you must get written permission from the DSP (called an
exemption) before starting. Exemptions allowing a person to work are not
normally granted within the first 26 weeks of Injury Benefit.

**Incapacity Supplement** is paid to people who are getting Disablement
Pension and who do not qualify for any other disability payments. You can work
provided you do not earn more than €33 a week on average. However, if you wish
to do other rehabilitative work or a training course you must get written
permission from the DSP before starting. Initial requests for an exemption to
do training courses are automatically granted but subsequent requests are
referred to a DSP medical advisor. If you wish to take part in a Community
Employment Scheme, you cannot retain your Incapacity Supplement but you can
retain your Disablement Benefit.

People getting Disablement Pension (without another payment) can work (full-
or part-time) and do not need permission from the Department.
