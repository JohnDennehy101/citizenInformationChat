##  Introduction

In Ireland, you can choose between private and public health services.

You can get public health services directly from the Health Service Executive
(HSE), and from HSE-funded organisations. Many public health services are
free, but you may be charged a fee for others.

You can get private health services from individual health professionals and
healthcare companies. You must pay the full cost of private health services
unless you have private health insurance.
