###  GP visit card

If you do not qualify for a medical card, you may qualify for a [ GP visit
card ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/health/medical-cards-and-gp-
visit-cards/gp-visit-cards/) instead. With a GP visit card, you don't have to
pay to see your doctor, but you will have to pay for medicines and other
services.

If you are aged under 70, the HSE will check your finances are below a certain
limit using a ‘means test’.

You can get a GP visit card without a means test if you are:

  * Over 70 
  * A [ child under 8 ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/health/medical-cards-and-gp-visit-cards/gp-visit-cards-for-under-8s/)
  * Getting [ Carer’s Benefit ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/social-welfare-payments/carers/carers-benefit/) or [ Carer’s Allowance ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/social-welfare-payments/carers/carers-allowance/)
