##  Maternity care when you return to Ireland

If you are pregnant, you can get free public maternity care if you have been
living in Ireland for at least a year, **or** if you intend to live here for
at least one year. This is provided through the [ Maternity and Infant Care
Scheme ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/health/health-
services/reproductive_health/maternity-and-infant-welfare-services/) .

Under the Scheme, you do not have to pay for any GP visits or hospital visits
related to your pregnancy and the birth of your baby.
