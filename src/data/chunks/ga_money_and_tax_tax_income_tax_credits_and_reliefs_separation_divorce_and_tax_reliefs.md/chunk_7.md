###  Separate assessment

If you were taxed under separate assessment, your income up to the date of
separation is assessed in the usual way. Unused [ tax credits ](/ga/money-and-
tax/tax/income-tax-credits-and-reliefs/introduction-to-income-tax-credits-and-
reliefs/) and [ rate bands ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/money-and-
tax/tax/income-tax/how-your-tax-is-calculated/#354b71) can be transferred
between you.

For the remainder of the tax year after separation, you will be treated as
single and you get the single personâ€™s tax credit and any other tax credits
you are entitled to.
