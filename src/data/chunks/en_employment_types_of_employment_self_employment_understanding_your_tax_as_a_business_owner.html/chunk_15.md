##  Tax for partnerships

A partnership is when 2 or more people come together to operate a business.
All income received by the partnership is shared between the partners.

While the partnership itself does not pay income tax, each partner must pay
tax on their share of the profits.

This means each individual partner must file an annual tax return under [ the
self-assessment system ](http://www.revenue.ie/en/business/self-
assessment.html) .
