###  **Penalties**

If your business is required to pay VAT, you must charge VAT to customers when
selling products or services. If a business fails to charge VAT to customers,
it could be liable for penalties of up to â‚¬4,000, while Revenue will also
charge a daily rate of interest on the unpaid amount.

Revenue can seize goods if you fail to pay VAT on goods received from another
EU country. It can also seize goods if a supplier applies a zero rate of tax
on goods that are marked for export, but do not leave Ireland.
