###  **Partnership**

Each partner in a partnership must pay income tax, PRSI and USC on their share
of business profits.

If your partnership is represented by a tax agent, they must apply online
through the [ Revenue Online Service (ROS) ](https://www.ros.ie/) . If your
partnership is not represented by a tax agent, you must complete a [ Form TR1
(pdf) ](https://www.revenue.ie/en/self-assessment-and-self-
employment/documents/form-tr1.pdf) . You will be given a Tax Reference Number
to use when trading and filing your tax returns.
