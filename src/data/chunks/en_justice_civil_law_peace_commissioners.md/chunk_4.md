##  Rules

There are no qualifying examinations or educational standards required to be
appointed as a Peace Commissioner but you are required to be a person of good
character. Anyone who has been charged with or convicted of a serious offence
will not be considered for appointment.

Most Peace Commissioners are well established in their local community. Those
being considered for appointment as a Peace Commissioner should be aware that
the Minister for Justice reserves the right to verify with the Garda√≠ that you
have never been charged or convicted of a serious offence.

If you are already serving as a Peace Commissioner and are convicted for a
serious offence during this time, your appointment as a Peace Commissioner
will cease immediately.

Civil servants are usually only appointed as Peace Commissioners when their
official duties requires this.

Solicitors and people employed in their offices and members of the clergy are
not appointed as Peace Commissioners because of the possibility of a conflict
of interest.

Peace Commissioner appointments are entirely at the discretion of the Minister
for Justice, having regard to the needs in your area. Your suitability for
appointment or your standing in the local community does not give any
automatic entitlement to be appointed as a Peace Commissioner.
