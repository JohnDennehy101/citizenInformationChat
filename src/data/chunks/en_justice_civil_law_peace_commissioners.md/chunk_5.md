##  Social media guidelines

Peace Commissioners must respect the integrity of the office and to behave to
the highest standards. This obligation applies to comments on social media
platforms or other public fora.

You should be aware of the implications of engaging in social media and online
conversations. Comments made in a personal capacity can sometimes be
attributed or perceived as the official position of the Department of Justice.

When using social media, whether in a personal capacity or otherwise, Peace
Commissioners are required to:

  * Ensure their actions do not bring the Office of Peace Commissioner into disrepute 
  * Use caution, common sense and exhibit sound judgment before posting to online platforms 
  * Respect the views and opinions of others 
  * Avoid unnecessary confrontation 
  * Be respectful of all individuals, races, religions and cultures 
  * Refrain from using slurs, insults or obscenities at all times 
  * Be considerate of othersâ€™ privacy 
  * Refrain from describing themselves as employees of the Department of Justice 

**In the event of any breach of these guidelines the Minister for Justice
reserves the right to remove a Peace Commissioner from office** .
