##  Immigration detention

In general, asylum seekers and irregular immigrants who may be detained under
Irish law include:

  * Non-nationals who arrive in Ireland and are refused leave to land 
  * International protection applicants who are deemed to be in one of the categories set out in Section 20(1) International Protection Act (see below) 
  * International protection applicants being transferred to another EU Member State under the Dublin Regulation who are at risk of absconding 
  * Non-nationals with outstanding deportation orders; and 
  * Non-nationals awaiting trial for a criminal immigration-related offence 

[ Section 20(1) of the International Protection Act 2015
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2015/act/66/enacted/en/print#sec20)
provides that international protection applicants may be detained by an
immigration officer or a member of Garda Síochána and arrested without warrant
if it is suspected that they:

  * Pose a threat to public security or public order in Ireland 
  * Have committed a serious non-political crime outside Ireland 
  * Have not made reasonable efforts to establish their identity (including non-compliance with the requirement to provide fingerprints) 
  * Intend to leave Ireland without lawful authority enter another state 
  * Have acted or plan to act in a manner that would undermine the system for granting persons international protection in Ireland or any arrangement relating to the [ Common Travel Area ](/en/government-in-ireland/ireland-and-the-uk/common-travel-area-between-ireland-and-the-uk/)
  * Have, without reasonable excuse, destroyed identity or travel documents or is in possession of fake identity documents 

There are currently no specialised detention centres for asylum seekers or
irregular migrants in Ireland. If detained under section 20(1) of the
International Protection Act 2015, you can be detained at a Garda station or
Cloverhill Prison. If detained at Cloverhill Prison, you should be separated
from the general prison population. Persons under 18 years of age cannot be
detained.

There is no maximum duration for the detention of protection applicants set
out in the International Protection Act. Section 20(12) indicates that a [
District Court ](/en/justice/courts-system/district-court/) judge can,
provided the relevant criteria are met, apply for detention for consecutive
21-day time periods with no upper limit.
