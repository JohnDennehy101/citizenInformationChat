##  Prison transfers

When you are sentenced to prison, or remanded in custody pending a further
court appearance, you will be committed to the prison named for the court area
where you appeared. However, the prison where you are to serve your sentence
may be changed at any time by the Minister for Justice.

As a prisoner, you have no legal right to serve your sentence in a prison of
your choice. However, you can apply to the Governor for a transfer to another
prison if you have a good reason. In most cases, the Prison Service will try
to make sure you are in a prison as close to your home as possible.

If you are transferred from one prison to another, you should be allowed, as
soon as reasonably possible, to let a family member or friend know that you
have been transferred.
