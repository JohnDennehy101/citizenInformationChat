###  Serving the appearance and defence

The appearance and defence must be sent to the claimant within 28 days of
receiving the claim notice, unless you request further information on the
claim being made (see Further Particulars section below). The claimant and
respondent agree to longer period. Evidence of this agreement must also be
filed with the District Court clerk.

If you do not send it in time, then the claimant can apply to the court for
_judgment in default_ . This means that because you have not shown your
intention to defend the case, you are taken to have admitted the claim against
you. There will be no hearing â€“ the court may simply make an order for
judgment against you.
