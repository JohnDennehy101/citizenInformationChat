##  Introduction

In the [ District Court ](/en/justice/courts-system/district-court/) , the
person who is bringing the case, that is, the person who is suing, is known as
the _claimant_ . The person who is being sued is known as the _respondent_ .

To commence proceedings, that is, to start a legal action, the claimant’s [
solicitor ](/en/justice/civil-law/representation-in-court/) prepares and
serves a _claim notice_ on the respondent. The respondent’s solicitor responds
with an _appearance and defence_ to show that they intend to defend the case.

They may also include in the appearance and defence a _statement of
counterclaim_ if they believe they have a claim against the claimant.
