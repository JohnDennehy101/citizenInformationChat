##  Claim notice

A claim notice is generally issued to commence proceedings in the District
Court. Usually a claim notice is prepared by the claimant's solicitor. The
claim notice must then be filed for issuing and the stamp duty paid at the [
District Court office ](/en/justice/courts-system/district-court/) .

A particular type of claim notice, known as a personal injuries summons, is
used where you have suffered personal injuries.
