####  **What happens after an inspection?**

If the HIQA inspectors find that your residential service is unsafe, or that
the [ National Standards ](https://www.hiqa.ie/reports-and-
publications/standard/national-standards-residential-services-children-and-
adults) and regulations are not being met, it has the legal power to take
action for you and the other people living there.

When this happens, HIQA can refuse to register the service, cancel the service
registration, or add conditions to the registration of that service.
