####  **What happens during an inspection?**

If you live in a residential facility, inspectors will talk to you and your
family. They will also talk to managers, staff and interested people who want
to speak to them.

The HIQA inspectors will ask you about your experience of living in the
residential service and what it is like to live there. They will also look at
the daily routines, the quality of the accommodation and meals, and other
aspects of daily life in the residential service.

The inspector wants to make sure you are safe and that you have a good quality
of life. They also want to check that you are included in decisions about your
personal care, and that you get support for your individual health and social
needs.
