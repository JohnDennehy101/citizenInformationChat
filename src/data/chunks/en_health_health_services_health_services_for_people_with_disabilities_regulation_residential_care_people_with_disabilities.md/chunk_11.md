##  Making a complaint

If you have a concern about a service, you can [ give information to HIQA
](https://www.hiqa.ie/concern-about-services) by phone, email or post.

While HIQA cannot investigate specific complaints, it reviews all the
information they get, which influences how it monitors services.

For example, if you give HIQA unsolicited information about a service, it can
then request the service provider to carry out an investigation or give more
information on that service.
