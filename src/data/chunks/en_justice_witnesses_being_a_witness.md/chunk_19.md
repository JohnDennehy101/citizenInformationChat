###  Re-examination

When the cross-examination is over, the solicitor or barrister for the person
who called you as a witness can carry out a re-examination. This means that
you will be asked more questions designed to clarify any issues that came up
during the cross-examination. During the re-examination, you cannot be asked
leading questions.
