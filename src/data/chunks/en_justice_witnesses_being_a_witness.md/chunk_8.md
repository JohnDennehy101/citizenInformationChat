###  The co-accused

Sometimes two or more people can be charged with a criminal offence and they
are tried at the same time. In this situation, the people being tried are
called the "co-accused". You cannot be forced to give evidence against a co-
accused if you are both being tried in the same proceedings. However, if the
prosecution refuses to offer any evidence against you and you are found not
guilty, then you can be forced to testify against a co-accused.
