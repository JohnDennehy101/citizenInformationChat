###  Leaving the stand

The judge can ask you questions, or to clarify something, at any time when you
are in the witness box. When the cross-examination or re-examination is over,
you will be asked to leave the stand. Normally that is the end of your
involvement in the case. However, sometimes you may be asked to come back to
court to give more evidence.
