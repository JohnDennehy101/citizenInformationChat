###  The accused

If you are the accused in a criminal case you cannot be forced to give
evidence in your defence. If you decide not to give evidence in the case, the
prosecution cannot comment on this to the jury.

If you do decide to give evidence in your trial, then you can be cross-
examined by the prosecution. You cannot refuse to answer these questions. The
prosecution cannot ask you questions about your previous bad character unless
you have:

  * Introduced evidence of your own good character or 
  * Questioned the character of any prosecution witness or 
  * Given evidence in your own defence against a co-accused (see below)
