###  Examination in chief

The solicitor or barrister for the person who called you as a witness will
then ask you a series of questions that allow you to give your evidence. This
is called the examination in chief.

The questions that you are asked at this stage are designed to guide you
through your evidence, so that you can give your account of what happened in
your own words. You should carefully consider each question and answer it
truthfully.

During the examination in chief, you cannot be asked _leading questions_ .
These are questions that suggest the answer. For example, you cannot be asked
"Did you see Mr. X cross the road?" but you can be asked "What did you see Mr.
X do?"
