###  The summons or subpoena

If someone in a court case wants to call you as a witness, you will get a
witness summons or a subpoena. This is a simple court form that sets out:

  * The name of the case 
  * The date and time that the case will be heard 
  * The court you must attend 

If you get a summons or subpoena, you must attend court on the date listed on
the form. If you fail to do so, you can be imprisoned for contempt of court.
You cannot refuse to attend court as a witness because you say you are
intimidated by one of the people in the case or because you are afraid to give
evidence.

You may get a _subpoena duces tecum_ . This type of subpoena means that as
well as having to attend court, you must bring along the documents listed in
the subpoena.
