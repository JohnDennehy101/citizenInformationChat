##  Witness expenses

As a court witness, you may be entitled to witness expenses.

If you are a witness for the prosecution in a criminal trial, you should tell
the investigating Garda what your expenses are. For example, you may miss out
on wages for the days that you are in court, and you may have travel expenses
to get to court. You should keep receipts for your expenses. The Garda will
apply to the judge to have the witnesses expenses paid. If the judge agrees
and makes an order, you will be given a cheque for your expenses.

If you are a witness for the defence in a criminal trial, you may also be
entitled to witness expenses. You should tell the solicitor who has summonsed
you to court what your expenses are.

If you are a witness in a civil trial, you will normally be entitled to any
out-of-pocket expenses you have incurred from having to give evidence. You
should speak to the solicitor who has summonsed you to court and they will
apply for expenses on your behalf. Normally all the witness expenses are paid
by the person who has lost the civil case, as the losing person will usually
be ordered to pay the costs of both sides.

Expert witnesses such as doctors and psychiatrists are paid a set fee for
giving evidence, whether it is a criminal trial or a civil trial. They are
also paid for the reports they write for the case.
