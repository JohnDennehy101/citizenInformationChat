##  How do I get a social worker in Ireland?

If you are experiencing social and emotional difficulties, you may get social
work services from the HSE. A team of social workers can work with you or with
a group.

You can ask your GP to refer you to a HSE social worker. You can also apply
directly to your [ Local Health Office
](http://www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/1/LHO/) or hospital for a social worker.

**Is there a social worker in my area?**

The availability of social workers varies from one HSE area to another. Some
Local Health Offices employ social workers specifically for the needs of older
people.

In every HSE local mental health team, there is usually one social worker. If
you need to see a social worker, contact any member of the team and leave a
message, or discuss your request at your outpatient appointment.

**You may be referred to another service if you are:**

  * Presenting with [ child protection and welfare concerns ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/birth-family-relationships/services-and-supports-for-children/child-abuse-and-protection/) . You will be referred to Children and Family Services in Tusla 
  * Presenting with [ elder abuse issues ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/birth-family-relationships/older-people/elder-abuse/) and significant mental health issues. You will be referred to the existing services where possible and appropriate. You can contact the Adult Safeguarding and Protection Team (01) 216 4511 or email safeguarding.cho@hse.ie 
  * Already linked to an existing social work service, either voluntary or statutory 

**What happens at a social work meeting?**

If you are referred to a social worker, you will meet them privately to talk
about any issues or concerns you have. You can bring another person with you
if you like.

You should bring your PPS number and medical card (if you have one).

The social worker may ask questions to better understand your problems and
help you get what you need. After the meeting, you and your social worker can
decide on a plan of action.
