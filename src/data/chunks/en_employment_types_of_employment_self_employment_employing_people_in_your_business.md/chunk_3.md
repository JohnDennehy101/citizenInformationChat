##  Register as an employer with Revenue

If you hire staff, you must register as an employer with Revenue before you
pay the employee. You can do this by telling Revenue your name, address and
intention to pay staff through the MyEnquiries tab on the [ Revenue Online
Service (ROS) ](https://www.ros.ie/) .

If you do not register as an employer, but Revenue believes that you are
acting as an employer, they will register you. You will get a formal notice of
registration from Revenue, and you have 14 days to challenge this in writing.
