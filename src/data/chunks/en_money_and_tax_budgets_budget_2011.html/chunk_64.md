###  School transport

The school transport charge for post-primary students increases by €50 to €350
per year, with a maximum charge of €650 per family.

A new charge of €50 is introduced for primary school pupils, except for
medical card holders , with a maximum charge of €110 per family.

The charges are subject to an overall maximum charge of €650 per family.

For the school year 2011/2012, the distance criteria will be applied to all
pupils attending primary schools. This means that children who live less than
3.2 kilometres (2 miles) from school, and who get free transport under the
“closed school” rule at present, will lose their transport eligibility.

Services for very small numbers of pupils will be discontinued. A minimum of
10 eligible children (up from 7 at present) will be required to establish or
retain services.

Further changes arising from the recent Value for Money review will take
effect from a later date.
