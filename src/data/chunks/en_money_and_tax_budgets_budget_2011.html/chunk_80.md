###  Public service

The Taoiseach’s salary will be reduced by €14,000, that of the Tánaiste by
€11,000 and the salaries of Ministers by €10,000. The system of State cars
will be reformed to include a pool system for Ministers based in Dublin. Ex-
office holders, such as former Taoisigh will also have a pooling arrangement.
One of the two Government jets will be disposed of.

New entrants to the public service will start at the lowest point of the
revised pay scale. This scale is 10% lower than that currently in operation.
In future, there will be a cap of €250,000 on salaries in the public service
and in semi-State organisations.

There will be cuts in all public service pensions. The cuts will apply to
existing beneficiaries.
