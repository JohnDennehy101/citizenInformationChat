###  Three-year tax exemption for start-up companies

This scheme is being extended to include start-up companies which start a new
trade in 2011. The scheme is being modified so that the value of the relief
will be linked to the amount of employers’ PRSI paid by a company in an
accounting period subject to a maximum of €5,000 per employee. If the amount
of qualifying employers’ PRSI is lower than the reduction in corporation tax
liability otherwise applicable, relief will be based on the lower amount

The Business Expansion Scheme will be transformed into the Employment and
Investment Incentive with an increase in the amount that companies can raise
under the scheme.
