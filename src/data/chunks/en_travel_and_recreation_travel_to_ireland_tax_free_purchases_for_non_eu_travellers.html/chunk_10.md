##  Where to apply

You should contact the retailer or refund agent about claims for refunds of
VAT. It should be noted that the Revenue Commissioners do not administer the

Retailers or refund agents can direct any enquiries to their Revenue office.

More [ information on the Retail Export Scheme
](https://www.revenue.ie/en/vat/retail-export-scheme/index.aspx) is available
