###  Documentary proof

Usually, proof of export, called a _certification of export_ , is the export
voucher stamped by Customs at the last point of departure from the EU. For
example, if you buy goods in Ireland and then travel to Germany before you
leave the EU, you must have the relevant documentation stamped by German
Customs authorities. Irish Customs authorities only stamp the documentation if
you have a ticket for a destination outside of the EU, valid not later than
the end of the third month from the date on which the goods were purchased.

If you are unable to have the documentation stamped by the relevant Customs
authorities at the point of departure or have not used the services of a VAT-
refunding agency, you can still have the documentation stamped in your own
country by a person of official status (for example, by Customs or the police)
before returning it to the retailer in Ireland.

There are additional conditions for residents of Great Britain. Proof of
importation into Great Britain and payment of any import duties will be
required in certain circumstances. You can get more details from [ Revenue
