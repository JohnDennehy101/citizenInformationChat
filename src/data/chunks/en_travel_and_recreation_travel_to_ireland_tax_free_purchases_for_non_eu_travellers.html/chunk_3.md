##  How the Retail Export Scheme works

The tax relief is provided under the Retail Export Scheme, which operates in 2
ways.

  1. You pay [ Value-Added Tax (VAT ](/en/money-and-tax/tax/duties-and-vat/value-added-tax/) ) when making purchases and get a refund from the relevant retailer or VAT-refunding agency when the retailer or the agency receives proof that the items have been exported. 
  2. In certain retail outlets, the goods are sold tax-free at the point of sale with or without the involvement of a VAT-refunding agency. The goods must be paid for by credit card. If the retailer or the agency does not receive proof that the goods have been exported, they charge the VAT on the goods to your credit card account. 

Before making a purchase, you should confirm with the retailer that they
operate the scheme. You should also clarify whether the retailer is operating
the scheme or with a VAT-refunding agency.

If an agency is being used, you should follow the agencyâ€™s specific procedures
when making the purchase. See 'using a VAT refund agency' below.

If the goods are being purchased without an agency, the retailer should issue
you with an export voucher for the purchase. When leaving Ireland, you should
get the voucher certified by Customs at the airport. The certified voucher is
returned to the retailer. If VAT has been paid the retailer refunds the VAT
(less any processing fee).
