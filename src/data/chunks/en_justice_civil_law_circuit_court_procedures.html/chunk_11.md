##  Notice for particulars

A defendant, at any time after being served with a Civil Bill and before
delivery of a defence, or a plaintiff, at any time after delivery of a defence
or counterclaim, may apply to the other party by a notice in writing for
_particulars_ . A notice for particulars is simply a formal request for more
information about the case. It contains specific questions or requests.

A request for copies of all or any of the documents upon which the action,
defence or counterclaim is founded is made on a [ Notice requiring copies of
documents ](https://courts.ie/content/notice-requiring-copies-documents) . A
request for information is made on a [ Notice requiring further information
](https://courts.ie/content/notice-requiring-further-information) . The
requested particulars should be delivered within 7 days of receiving the
notice.

For example, in a case involving a road traffic accident, the defendant may
send to the plaintiff a notice containing the following questions:

"Was the plaintiff's seat-belt fastened at the time of the accident?"

"Describe the exact location where the accident occurred with the aid of a
map".

The notice is usually prepared by the solicitor (sometimes with the advice of
a barrister).
