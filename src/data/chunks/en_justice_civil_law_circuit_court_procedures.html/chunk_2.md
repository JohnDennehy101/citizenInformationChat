##  Introduction

In the [ Circuit Court ](/en/justice/courts-system/circuit-court/) , the
person who is bringing the case, that is, the person who is suing, is known as
the _plaintiff_ . The person who is being sued is known as the _defendant_ .

To commence proceedings, that is, to start a legal action, the plaintiff or
the plaintiff's [ barrister ](/en/justice/courtroom/barristers/) prepares a
_Civil Bill_ . The purpose of this document is to state the case being made
against the defendant.

When the defendant receives the Civil Bill, they must _enter an appearance_ to
show that they are now a party to the case and intend to defend it. The
defendant will then issue a _defence_ setting out why they are not to blame.

If the defendant believes that they actually have a claim against the
plaintiff, the defendant will include a _counterclaim_ with the defence
setting out their claim against the plaintiff.
