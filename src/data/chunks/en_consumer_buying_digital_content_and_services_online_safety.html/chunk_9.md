###  **Illegal content**

Online platforms must have a way for you to tell them about illegal content.
If you tell them about something illegal, they must review it and act if they
agree. They must do this quickly and tell you what they decide.

If the platform does not delete the content or respond to you, you can [ make
a complaint ](/en/consumer/how-to-complain/complain-about-online-platforms/)
to Coimisiún na Meán.

If you or someone else is in immediate danger or risk of harm, call emergency
services, for free, by dialling 112 from any phone.

You can also report illegal content anonymously and confidentially to the
Internet Service Providers Association (ISPAI) at [ Hotline.ie
](https://www.hotline.ie/) .
