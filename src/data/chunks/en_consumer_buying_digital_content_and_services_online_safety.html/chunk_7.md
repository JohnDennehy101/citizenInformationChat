##  What is illegal content?

Content is illegal if it breaks Irish or EU law.

A person can be guilty of a criminal offence if their online content includes:

  * A serious threat of violence that is believable 
  * A campaign to harass someone (including cyberbullying) 
  * Making threats, being abusive or saying insulting things that could create hate against a group of people based on their race, colour, nationality, religion, ethnic or national origins, membership of the travelling community or sexual orientation 
  * Sending an unwanted picture of someone’s genitals to cause distress, fear or alarm 
  * Engaging in offensive sexual behaviour 
  * Sharing an intimate picture without the person’s permission 
  * Urging someone to try harm themselves or providing information on how to attempt suicide 
  * Creating or sharing materials involving the sexual abuse of children or promoting such materials 
  * Encouraging terrorist activities or making threats to commit acts of terrorism 

Coimisiún na Meán has a useful table showing which pieces of legislation cover
each type of illegal content – see ‘ [ What makes content illegal’
