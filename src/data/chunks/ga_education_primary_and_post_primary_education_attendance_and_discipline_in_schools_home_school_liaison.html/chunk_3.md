##  What is a Home School Community Liaison co-ordinator?

A HSCL co-ordinator is a designated teacher in a school who works with parents
or guardians of students who are experiencing, or likely to experience,
educational disadvantage. They engage with parents, the school and the
community, and they offer support and guidance to help students reach their
full potential.

The HSCL co-ordinator can:

  * [ Visit you at home ](https://www.tusla.ie/tess/information-for-parents-and-guardians-tess/home-school-liaison-community-liaison/what-is-a-home-visit/) to build a relationship between home and school (see ‘Home School Community Liaison Scheme and home visits’ below) 
  * Provide information about possible book rental schemes, local uniform suppliers, school subjects, and [ after school activities ](https://www.tusla.ie/tess/information-for-parents-and-guardians-tess/home-school-liaison-community-liaison/can-the-hscl-coordinator-give-me-information-about-after-school-activities-and-supports-available-for-my-child/)
  * Organise [ recreational or educational classes for parents based on their interests ](https://www.tusla.ie/tess/information-for-parents-and-guardians-tess/home-school-liaison-community-liaison/what-is-a-course-for-parents/) (for example, cooking, computer or fitness classes, or classes about parenting skills or children transitioning to a new school) 
  * Support you and your family as your child [ moves through the education system ](https://www.tusla.ie/tess/information-for-parents-and-guardians-tess/home-school-liaison-community-liaison/can-the-hscl-coordinator-offer-support-around-my-childs-transition/)

The HSCL co-ordinator provides updates on your child’s progress and
attendance, listens to your views as a parent, and provides information about
the school and about services available in the community.

The co-ordinator works closely with the [ School Completion Programme
](https://www.tusla.ie/tess/information-for-parents-and-guardians-tess/school-
completion-programme-pg/) and the [ Education Welfare Service
](https://www.tusla.ie/tess/information-for-parents-and-guardians-
