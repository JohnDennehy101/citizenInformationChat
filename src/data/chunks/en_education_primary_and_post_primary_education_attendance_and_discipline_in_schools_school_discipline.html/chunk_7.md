##  What happens if my child is expelled from school?

Before your child is expelled, the school must tell the educational welfare
officer in writing of its decision. The educational welfare officer may then
try to find a solution. Your child cannot be expelled until 20 days after the
educational welfare officer has been notified about the case.

If your child is expelled they will lose their place at the school.

You can appeal the decision to expel your child from school to the Department
of Education. You must appeal within 42 days of the decision – see ‘How to
appeal a suspension or expulsion’ below.
