##  Code of behaviour for students

When your child starts school, the principal must give you a copy of the
schoolâ€™s code of behaviour. You may also be asked to agree to make all
reasonable efforts to ensure that your child complies with the code.

The code of behaviour in a school sets out the:

  * Standards of behaviour that the student attending the school must follow 
  * Disciplinary measures that may be taken 
  * Procedures to follow before a student is suspended or expelled 
  * Grounds for lifting a suspension 

Department of Education guidelines recommend that the [ prevention of bullying
](/en/education/primary-and-post-primary-education/attendance-and-discipline-
in-schools/bullying-in-schools-in-ireland/) should be a fundamental part of
the written code of behaviour and discipline in all schools.

Codes are drawn up with input from teachers, parents and the educational
welfare officer. Educational welfare officers work for [ Tusla (the Child and
Family Agency) ](http://www.tusla.ie/services/educational-welfare-services/)
and they help co-ordinate all policies around [ attendance
](/en/education/primary-and-post-primary-education/attendance-and-discipline-
in-schools/school-attendance/) and broader educational welfare.

There are [ Guidelines for Schools on Developing a Code of Behaviour (pdf)
](http://www.tusla.ie/uploads/content/guidelines_school_codes_eng.pdf) and [
information for parents and guardians about schools
](https://www.tusla.ie/tess/information-for-parents-and-guardians-tess/) on
the Tusla website.
