##  Introduction

Schools must have a code of behaviour for students. It is drawn up by the
board of management with help from parents and staff.

The code of behaviour sets out how students are expected to behave. It also
sets out how students will be disciplined, if they do not follow the code.

If you want to appeal a suspension or expulsion, you must appeal in writing
within 42 days of the decision by the board of management. You can read more
about 'How to appeal a suspension or expulsion from school' below.
