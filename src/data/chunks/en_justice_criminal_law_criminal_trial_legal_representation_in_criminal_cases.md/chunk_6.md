###  **Duty to the court**

The defence counsel also owes a duty to the court. They must not knowingly
state a lie in court.

If you tell your defence counsel that you are guilty before the start of the
trial, they can continue to act for you whether you choose to plead guilty or
not guilty in court.

However, if you plead not guilty, they are very restricted as to the type of
defence they can mount on your behalf.
