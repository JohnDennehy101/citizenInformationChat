###  Pre-nuptial agreements

A [ pre-nuptial agreement ](/en/birth-family-relationships/getting-
married/pre-nuptial-agreements/) (also called an _ante-nuptial agreement_ ) is
an agreement between two people who plan to marry each other. It relates to
property, maintenance and custody arrangements in the event of marriage
breakdown.

A court must make sure that spouses and children are adequately taken care of
when a marriage breaks down. A pre-nuptial agreement is not legally binding,
but it can serve as a guide for the courts on what the partiesâ€™ intentions
were at the outset of the marriage in judicial separation and divorce cases.
