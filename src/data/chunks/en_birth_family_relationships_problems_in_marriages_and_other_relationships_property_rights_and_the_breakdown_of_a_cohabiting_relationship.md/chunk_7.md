###  You are not married but your name is on the title deeds

If both your names are on the title deeds, you are both legal owners of the
property. You jointly have to make decisions as to what will happen to the
property.

If you cannot come to an agreement, you can apply to the court to have the
property sold and the proceeds divided, or it may be possible to seek an order
breaking up the property. This would allow each party to decide what to do
with their portion. This may be possible where there is a lot of land
connected to the family home, or if there is more than one residence on the
property.
