###  Your name is not on the title deeds but you made contributions to the
purchase of the house

Whether you are married or not, if your name is not on the title deeds to the
house, you may still be able to show that you have some ownership rights in
relation to the house.

These rights are based on the fact that you may have made a contribution,
(either directly or indirectly), to the purchase price of the house with the
intention of gaining a share in the ownership of the house. Usually, if you
can show that you made a contribution to the purchase price of the house, you
will be entitled to a share in the house in some proportion to your
contribution.

For example, if you paid off half of the mortgage (and the mortgage
represented 90% of the purchase price), you may roughly be entitled to 45% of
the ownership of the property.
