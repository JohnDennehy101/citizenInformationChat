###  Property adjustment order

If you are married and applying for [ judicial separation ](/en/birth-family-
relationships/separation-and-divorce/judicial-separation/) or [ divorce
](/en/birth-family-relationships/separation-and-divorce/divorce-decrees/) ,
and you cannot agree on what happens to the house, the court will make a
_property adjustment order_ . This is where **the court decides** what happens
to the property.

The court will [ consider a range of factors ](/en/birth-family-
relationships/separation-and-divorce/factors-in-separation-divorce/) before
making a property adjustment order, including your financial and accommodation
needs. Depending on these factors, the court will decide which assets (or
percentage of the assets) you and your spouse should get.
