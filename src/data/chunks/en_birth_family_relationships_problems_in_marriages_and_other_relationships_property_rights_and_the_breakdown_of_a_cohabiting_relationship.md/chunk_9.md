out certain legal rights and protections that cohabiting couples have, which
may allow you seek redress in the courts. To qualify for any [ redress
](/en/birth-family-relationships/problems-in-marriages-and-other-
relationships/redress-scheme-for-cohabiting-couples/) orders, such as a
property adjustment order, cohabiting couples without children have to have
lived together in an intimate and committed relationship for 5 years. If you
have children together, it is 2 years.

A court will only make such an order if it is satisfied that one partner was
financially dependent on the other cohabitant partner.
