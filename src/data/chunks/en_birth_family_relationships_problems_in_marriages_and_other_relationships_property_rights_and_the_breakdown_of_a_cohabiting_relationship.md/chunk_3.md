##  Your property rights if you are married

If the house was bought and the title deeds are in both your name and your
spouse’s name, you are joint owners. This is also known as a _joint tenancy_ .
In this case, you and your partner can agree to either:

  * Sell the property and split the proceeds (money) after any outstanding mortgage is paid 
  * ‘Buy out’ your partner’s share of the property so that you become the sole owner. If there is a mortgage on the home, you will have to get the agreement of the bank. 

It is important to remember that if you took out a mortgage with your spouse
or partner, you are _jointly liable_ for the mortgage payments. Even if your
spouse stops paying, you are still responsible for the whole amount.

[ Family mediation ](/en/birth-family-relationships/separation-and-
divorce/family-mediation-separating-couples/) can help you come to an
agreement on how you manage your affairs when your marriage breaks down,
including the division of your assets.

You do not have to be a _legal owner_ (have your name on the title deeds) of
the family home to have a legal right to the property after marriage
breakdown. It all depends on the surrounding facts. Matters such as each
person’s contribution (financial and otherwise) to the home and the family
will be very important.

You cannot sell, mortgage, lease or transfer your family home without the
_consent_ (permission) of your spouse. This is set out in the [ Family Home
Protection Act 1976
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1976/act/27/enacted/en/html) as amended
by the [ Family Law Act 1995
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1995/act/26/enacted/en/html) . Similar
protection is provided for the shared home of civil partners in civil
partnership legislation. These provisions do not apply to cohabiting couples.
