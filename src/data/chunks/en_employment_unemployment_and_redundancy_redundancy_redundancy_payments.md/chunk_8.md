###  How is average regular overtime calculated?

Average weekly overtime is calculated as follows:

  * You exclude any overtime for the 13 weeks before the date of redundancy 
  * Find the total amount of overtime earned in the previous 26 weeks (excluding the 13 weeks before the date of redundancy) 
  * If there were any weeks you did not work in the 26 weeks, then the 26 weeks can be extended back for every week not worked 
  * Divide the total by 26 to get the average weekly overtime 

This average overtime is added to the normal weekly pay.
