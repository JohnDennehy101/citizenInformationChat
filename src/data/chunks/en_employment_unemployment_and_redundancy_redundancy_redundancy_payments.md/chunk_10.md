##  How is my length of service calculated?

_Reckonable service_ is the length of time you have been employed in your job
that is taken into account when calculating a redundancy payment.

Some absences from work over the last 3 years are deducted from your
reckonable service. Absences outside of this 3-year period are not deducted.
The 3-year period ends on the date your employment ends.
