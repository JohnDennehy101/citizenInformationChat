##  How is my gross weekly pay calculated?

When calculating your redundancy payment, pay means your gross pay before tax
and PRSI deductions.

Gross weekly pay includes:

  * Your current normal weekly pay 
  * Average regular overtime 
  * Benefits-in-kind 

If you are paid monthly, your normal monthly pay is divided by 4.33 to
calculate the weekly pay.
