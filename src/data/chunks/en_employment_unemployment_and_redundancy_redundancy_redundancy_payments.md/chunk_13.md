##  Lay off from work due to COVID-19 and reckonable service

If you were on the [ Temporary COVID-19 Wage Subsidy Scheme (TWSS)
](/en/employment/unemployment-and-redundancy/covid19-temporary-wage-subsidy-
scheme/) or [ Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS)
](/en/employment/unemployment-and-redundancy/employment-wage-subsidy-scheme/)
, this period is counted as reckonable service for calculating statutory
redundancy.

However, any period of layoff during the pandemic is not counted as reckonable
service (read about _reckonable service_ in ‘How is my length of service
calculated?’ above).
