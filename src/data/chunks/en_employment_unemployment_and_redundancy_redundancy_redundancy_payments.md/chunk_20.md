##  If I do not get my redundancy pay

If your employer does not give you statutory redundancy pay when you are
entitled to it, you should write to them asking for payment. If you have an
employee representative, such as a trade union official, they may be able to
help.

If your employer has not paid your redundancy lump sum, you should apply to
your employer for it using form [ RP77 (pdf)
](http://www.workplacerelations.ie/en/Publications_Forms/Claim_by_an_Employee_Against_an_Employer_for_a_Lump_Sum_or_Part_of_a_Lump_Sum_RP77_.pdf)
.

If your employer cannot pay or they are insolvent, you can apply to get the
payment from the Government under the Social Insurance Fund. Get more advice
