##  How much redundancy pay will I get?

The statutory redundancy payment is a lump-sum based on your pay and length of
service.

If you are eligible for redundancy pay, you are entitled to:

  * Two weeks' pay for every year of service 
  * One additional week's pay 

The maximum weekly amount used to calculate redundancy pay is €600 a week (or
€31,200 a year), even if your pay is more per week.

redundancy pay you might be entitled to.
