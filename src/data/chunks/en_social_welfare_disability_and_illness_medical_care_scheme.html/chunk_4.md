To apply, fill in a [ Medical Care form C1 (pdf)
](https://assets.gov.ie/24391/1903912433de49c9beb486097ce41547.pdf) . If you
don't have a C1 form, you can phone the Medical Care Section and ask them to
send you a C1 (see address below). You can get more information on the scheme
in the leaflet [ Medical Care SW34
](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/5903e4-operational-guidelines-
occupational-injuries-benefit-medical-care-un/) .

Make sure you quote your [ PPS number ](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-
welfare-system/personal-public-service-number/) on any receipts you send in
with the medical care claim form C1. Note that only original receipts are
accepted, payment will not issue for a claim based on photocopied receipts.
