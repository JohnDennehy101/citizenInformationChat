##  Introduction

If you are injured at work, on an unbroken journey to/from work or you
contract a prescribed occupational disease you may get benefits under the [
Occupational Injuries Scheme ](/en/social-welfare/disability-and-
illness/occupational-injuries-benefit-overview/) . One of these benefits is
Medical Care. The Medical Care Scheme allows you to get a refund of the costs
of medical care and attention that are not paid by the [ Health Service
Executive (HSE) ](/en/health/health-system/health-service-executive/) or
covered by the Treatment Benefit Scheme.
