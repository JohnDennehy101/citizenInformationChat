##  How does the Rental Accommodation Scheme work?

Local authorities draw up contracts with landlords to provide housing for
people with a long-term housing need. The landlord agrees to provide housing
for a specific amount of time, and this is covered in the contract with the
local authority.

The local authority pays the rent directly to the landlord. You may still
contribute to your rent but you pay this contribution to your local authority,
not to your landlord.

The main points of the scheme are:

  * Your local authority pays the full rent to your landlord for you 
  * Your landlord must register your tenancy with the [ Residential Tenancies Board (RTB) ](/en/housing/renting-a-home/resolving-disputes/residential-tenancies-board/) and it is covered by residential tenancies legislation 
  * Your accommodation must meet [ minimum standards for private rental accommodation ](/en/housing/renting-a-home/tenants-rights-and-responsibilities/minimum-standards-for-rented-homes/) and your landlord is responsible for maintaining and repairing the property 
  * You do not need a deposit, as the local authority has the contract with your landlord 
  * If you get a full-time job, you can stay renting under RAS
