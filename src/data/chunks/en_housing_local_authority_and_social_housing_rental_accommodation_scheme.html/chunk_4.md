###  When you are a RAS tenant

You can stay on your local authorities housing waiting list, if you get
housing with RAS. However, you may need to apply to your local authority to go
on their transfer list. You can check the process for this in your local
authorities Housing Allocation Scheme. This is available on [ your local
authorityâ€™s ](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/942f74-local-authorities/)
website.
