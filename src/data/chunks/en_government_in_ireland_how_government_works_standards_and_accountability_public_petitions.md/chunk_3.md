##  Petition guidelines

If you are submitting a petition it must relate to a matter on which the
Houses of the Oireachtas have the power to act and the petition must be in the
proper form. It must not:

  * Relate to a case where court proceedings have been initiated and the case will be heard before a jury 
  * Contain any names of individuals 
  * Contain offensive language 
  * Be frivolous 
  * Be the same as a petition brought by you, or on your behalf, during the current lifetime of the DÃ¡il 
  * Require the committee to consider a complaint that has already had a decision made about it by an Ombudsman or some redress body. 

You will be asked to show that you have already tried to resolve the issue
raised in your petition, for example, by raising it with the Ombudsman, public
bodies, or directly with the relevant Government Department.

Your petition should also include the name and address of anyone who has
agreed to support the petition, though only one signature is necessary to
submit a petition.
