##  Decision process

You submit your petition to the [ Joint Committee on Public Petitions.
](https://www.oireachtas.ie/en/committees/33/petitions/) The Joint Committee
must first decide whether your petition is compliant with [ Dáil and Seanad
standing orders (pdf)
](http://petitions.oireachtas.ie/online_petitions.nsf/Standing Orders
\(English\).pdf) . If it decides that it is, it will then consider your
petition.

When considering your petition the Joint Committee may invite you to appear
before it. It may also seek oral or written evidence from the relevant
government department, as well as other relevant bodies. It may also:

  * Refer your petition to some other parliamentary committee for further consideration 
  * Refer your petition to an ombudsman or some regulatory or redress body 

Following its considerations, the Joint Committee makes a decision on what
further action it will take. This action can include reporting to the [ Dáil
](/en/government-in-ireland/houses-of-the-oireachtas/dail-eireann/) with
recommendations, and requesting that the report be debated by the Dáil.

If the Joint Committee decides that no further action is required your
petition will be closed. You will be notified of the Joint Committee’s final
decision.
