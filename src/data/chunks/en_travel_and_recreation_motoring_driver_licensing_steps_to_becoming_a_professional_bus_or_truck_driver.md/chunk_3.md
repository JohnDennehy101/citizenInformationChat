###  Professional driver obligations under EU law

Under European law, people who drive for a living must have regular training.
This is to make sure they have a high standard of safety and driving. The RSA
introduced the Driver CPC. Since September 2014, all professional truck and
bus drivers must carry a Driver CPC. You must also have a full driving licence
in the category of vehicle that you are driving.
