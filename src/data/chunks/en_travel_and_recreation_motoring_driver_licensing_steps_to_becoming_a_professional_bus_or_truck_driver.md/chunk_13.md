##  Step 9: Keep up training for your Driver CPC card

You must update your Driver CPC qualification every 5 years. This is called [
periodic training ](https://www.rsa.ie/services/professional-
drivers/cpc/periodic-training-and-compliance) . You must attend one module per
year with an approved CPC training organisation. For the [ dual CPC
qualification ](https://www.rsa.ie/services/professional-drivers/cpc/periodic-
training-and-compliance#:~:text=The%20CPC%20training,account.) (both bus and
truck), there are 6 training modules over 5 years. In both cases, training
must be for one day and a minimum of 7 hours per day.

The training covers:

  * Road safety 
  * Environmental driving 
  * Driver health well-being 

It does not involve a driving test or assessment.
