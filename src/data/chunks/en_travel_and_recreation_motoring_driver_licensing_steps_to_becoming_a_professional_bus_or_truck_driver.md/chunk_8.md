##  Step 4: Practise driving

Before taking a test, you should take lessons. The more prepared you are the
better your chances of passing the driving test are. You should complete
lessons with an [ RSA Approved Driving Instructor (ADI)
](https://www.rsa.ie/services/learner-drivers/driving-lessons/find-an-
instructor/approved-driving-instructor) . However, you are not required to
take [ truck or bus driving lessons ](https://www.rsa.ie/services/learner-
drivers/driving-lessons/professional-driving-lessons-\(cpc\)) to get a CPC
driving licence.
