##  Rate of Jobseeker's Allowance for people under 25

**Maximum rate of JA for people under 25** **Age** |  **Personal rate** |  **Increase for an adult dependant**  
---|---|---  
18 - 24  |  €141.70  |  €141.70   
  
The reduced personal and qualified adult rates of Jobseeker’s Allowance (JA)
for people under 25 do not apply to:

  * People with dependent children 
  * People living independently and getting a state housing support such as Rent Supplement, Rental Accommodation Scheme (RAS) or Housing Assistance Payment (HAP), Local Authority Housing or housing provided by certain Approved Housing Bodies 
  * People transferring from Disability Allowance to JA 
  * People whose claim is linked to a previous JA claim made within the previous 12 months to which the maximum personal rate applied 
  * Certain children who were in the care of the HSE or the Child and Family Agency (TUSLA) during the 12 months before reaching 18. These people are assessed using the JA rate for people aged 25 or over. 

If you were getting an age-related reduced rate of JA and you take part in a
course of education or training or an employment scheme, the reduced personal
rate of payment applicable to that course or scheme will apply as long as you
are aged under 25. When you complete the course, you will go back to your
previous age-related JA rate.
