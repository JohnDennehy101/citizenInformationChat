##  Students

Third-level students cannot claim Jobseeker's Allowance or Benefit while you
are studying full-time. This disqualification also applies to the summer
holiday periods between academic years (unless you are a mature student or you
are getting Back to Education Allowance). However, once you have finished
college permanently, you can claim a jobseeker's payment if you cannot find
work. This is also the case if you leave college without finishing your
course. You may be able to claim a jobseekerâ€™s payment while you are working
on a project or research thesis if you are available for work during this
time.

[ Student credits ](http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/Can-I-qualify-for-student-
credits.aspx) may help you to qualify for Jobseeker's Benefit. They are
awarded where you were a full-time student during the relevant tax year and
had paid contributions before going to college or during the period spent at
college.

You must have:

  * Paid contributions at Class A 
  * Started full-time education before 23 years of age 
  * Re-entered insurable employment after the course is finished 

Student credits can only be awarded only once.
