##  Jobseeker's Benefit

You must have at least 104 social insurance contributions (2 years) to qualify
for [ Jobseeker’s Benefit (JB) ](/en/social-welfare/unemployed-
people/jobseekers-benefit/) . This means that many young people do not qualify
for Jobseeker’s Benefit if they lose their job or cannot find employment. If
you worked part-time during school or college, you may have enough PRSI
contributions to qualify for JB, but if your average weekly earnings were
below €300 you may only qualify for a lower rate of JB.
