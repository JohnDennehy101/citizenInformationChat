##  Getting household rubbish collected

You should put your rubbish in a wheelie-bin or other sturdy refuse bin for
collection, or in strong plastic bags. You should not leave it out too long
before it is due to be collected, as it may attract birds or animals and
create litter.

It is an offence to put your household waste in street litter bins. If you do
this, the local authority can prosecute you. [ Burning household waste
