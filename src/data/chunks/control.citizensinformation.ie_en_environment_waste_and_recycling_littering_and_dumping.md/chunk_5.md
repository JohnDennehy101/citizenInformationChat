###  Litter and public places

If you own or are responsible for a place that is open to the public you have
a legal duty to keep the place litter-free, regardless of how the litter got
there. These public places include:

  * School grounds 
  * Public parks 
  * Train or bus stations 
  * The area around shopping centres
