###  Local authorities and litter prevention

Local authorities are responsible for keeping public places in their area
clear of litter. Their duties include:

  * Street cleaning 
  * Providing and emptying litter bins 
  * Enforcing fines 
  * Enforcing littering rules and regulations and taking legal action against people who don't follow the law 

Local authorities also:

  * Prepare litter management plans, in consultation with the local community. A plan must set out how the local authority will prevent and control litter and make people more aware of litter 
  * Carry out litter pollution surveys and send the data to the [ National Litter Monitoring System ](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/5a64c-national-litter-pollution-monitoring-scheme/) , which assesses changes over time 
  * Offer grants for anti-litter and anti-graffiti awareness projects, such as the [ TidyTowns competition ](https://www.tidytowns.ie/)
