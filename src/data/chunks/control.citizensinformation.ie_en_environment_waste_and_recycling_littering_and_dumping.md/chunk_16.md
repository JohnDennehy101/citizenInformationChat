##  How do I report illegal dumping?

If you notice illegal dumping, you can report it to the local authority. They
can then investigate it and take action. Alternatively, you can report it to
the 24-hour National Environmental Complaints Line – see ‘More information on
litter’ below.

The complaints line will pass your report to the appropriate body, which may
be:

  * A local authority 
  * An Garda Síochána 
  * The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) 

The EPA website provides more information on [ how to make an environmental
complaint ](http://www.epa.ie/enforcement/report/#.VIhHB4lybhl) .

If a local authority can find out who owns material that has been illegally
dumped, the owner can be prosecuted, even if they haven’t been caught in the
act of dumping. Local authorities can also require you, as a householder or
business operator, to say how and where you are disposing of your waste. They
can do this if you do not use a refuse collection service or bring your waste
to an authorised disposal facility.

**Abandoned vehicles and bikes**

**Abandoned vehicles**

If you think a car has been abandoned, you should report it to your local
authority. They will look into it and remove the car, if needed. When you
report it, you should let them know the:

  * Exact location of the car 
  * Make and model of the car 
  * Car registration (if possible) 

The local authority will contact the car owner to see if the car has been
abandoned. They may also put a notice on the car to say it is considered
abandoned and may be removed.

**Abandoned bicycles**

You can report a bicycle that you think is abandoned. A bike is usually
considered abandoned if it:

  * Is in poor condition with missing or broken parts 
  * Has been left unused for a long time 

When reporting it, you should tell the local authority:

  * The exact location of the bike 
  * The bike’ make, model and colour 
  * Any other distinguishing features 

The local authority will investigate and may put a tag on the bike to let the
owner that it may be removed.
