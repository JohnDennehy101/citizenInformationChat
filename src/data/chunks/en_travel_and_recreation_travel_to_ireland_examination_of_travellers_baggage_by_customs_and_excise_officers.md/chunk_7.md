###  Intimate body search

An intimate body search may involve the removal and search of clothing and a
visual examination of the undressed person by an officer or medical
practitioner to verify if drugs are being concealed.

You cannot be subjected to an intimate body search for drugs unless:

  * Customs officers have reasonable cause to suspect that you have a controlled drug.
