##  Public hospital patients

If you are a public patient you do not have to pay for consultants' services
and you do not have a choice of consultants.

In many areas, there can be waiting lists for non-emergency services. You can
check information on [ waiting times for in-patient treatment
](http://www.ntpf.ie/home/nwld.htm) .

You can get public health services in [ HSE hospitals and
](http://www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/3/acutehospitals/hospitals/) in public
voluntary hospitals. Most of these hospitals also provide private health care
but they must clearly distinguish between public and private hospital beds.
