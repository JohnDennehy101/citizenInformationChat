####  Regulation and enforcement

The FSPO has no role in regulating financial service providers (see Central
Bank of Ireland above).

However, the FSPO can tell the Central Bank or the Pensions Authority about
any concerns arising from an investigation, so that appropriate regulatory
action can be taken.
