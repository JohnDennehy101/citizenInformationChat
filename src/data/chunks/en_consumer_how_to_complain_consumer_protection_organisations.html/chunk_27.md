####  Regulation and enforcement

The BAI publishes a code of practice, known as [ the BAI code
](https://www.bai.ie/en/codes-standards/#al-block-7) . The BAI is
responsibilities for making sure that licensed broadcasters comply with the
code.

When the BAI gets a complaint it looks at:

  * Matters identified in the complaint 
  * Relevant Code 
  * Provisions of the Broadcasting Act 2009 
  * Provisions of the Audiovisual Media Services Directive 2010/13/EU 
  * Procedures, practices and policies of the BAI. 

The BAI will decide whether or not the broadcaster has respected the relevant
codes and legislation.

All decisions of the BAI are available to the public. Unless the BAI considers
it inappropriate to do so, summaries of all complaints are given to the media
and put on its website.
