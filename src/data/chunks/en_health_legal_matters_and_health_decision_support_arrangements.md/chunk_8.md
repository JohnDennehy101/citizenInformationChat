###  Advance healthcare directive

You can make a written statement about the type of medical or surgical
treatment you want or do not want, if in the future you are unable to make
these decisions. This is called an [ advance healthcare directive
](/en/health/legal-matters-and-health/advance-care-directives/) (AHD). You
must have capacity to make an AHD. As part of an AHD, you can choose someone
you know and trust as your designated healthcare representative to act on your
behalf, advising healthcare workers of the decisions you made in the
directive. You are not obliged to nominate a designated healthcare
representative if you make a AHD.
