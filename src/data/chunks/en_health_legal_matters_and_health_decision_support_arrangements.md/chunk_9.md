###  Enduring power of attorney

You can make an [ enduring power of attorney ](/en/death/before-a-death/power-
of-attorney/) if you do not currently have capacity issues, but would like to
plan ahead for a time when you may no longer have capacity. This is an
arrangement where you appoint someone you trust as your attorney. Their job is
to act on your behalf to make certain decisions if you are unable to in the
future. An enduring power of attorney cannot cover healthcare matters, as
these must be dealt with in an advance healthcare directive. You or your
attorney, on your behalf, must register the agreement with the [ Decision
Support Service ](https://decisionsupportservice.ie/) . They keep a register
of enduring power of attorneys.
