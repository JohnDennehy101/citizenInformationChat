##  Search the register of decision support arrangements

The Decision Support Service will keep a register of decision support
arrangements.

Not everyone will be able to search the register. Access will be limited to
certain organisations, people in certain professional bodies that have been
approved by the Decision Support Service and some members of the public who
can show they have a legitimate interest.

The Decision Support Service will keep a searchable register of:

  * [ Co-decision-making agreements ](/en/health/legal-matters-and-health/co-decision-making-agreement/)
  * [ Decision-making representation orders ](/en/health/legal-matters-and-health/decision-making-representative-order/)
  * [ Enduring powers of attorney ](/en/death/before-a-death/power-of-attorney/)

They will also keep a record of everybody who asks to search a register.

Read more about [ searching the register
](https://www.decisionsupportservice.ie/services/search-register) on the
Decision Support Service website.

The register will only become active on the Decision Support Service website
once searchable arrangements are registered, [ check this update for more

register) .
