##  Summary of the decision support arrangements

You may need different levels of support to make a specific decision at a
specific time. The arrangement depends on your level of capacity, present and
future, and the type of decision.

If you are currently facing difficulties making decisions, or may in the near
future, 3 decision support arrangements are available. These are tiered from
needing some support with decisions to having decisions made on your behalf.
