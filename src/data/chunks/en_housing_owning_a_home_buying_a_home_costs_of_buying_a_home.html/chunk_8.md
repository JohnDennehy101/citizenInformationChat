##  Mortgage protection insurance

[ Mortgage protection insurance ](/en/housing/owning-a-home/buying-a-
home/insurance-protection-on-mortgages/) is designed to pay the balance of
your mortgage if you die before the loan is fully repaid. In general, lenders
are legally obliged to make sure that you have enough mortgage protection
cover when you take out a home loan, although you do not have to arrange this
insurance directly through them. Premiums vary but always reduce over the life
of the loan as the amount of the loan reduces.

Local authorities run their own collective [ Mortgage Protection Insurance
(MPI) scheme (pdf)

and people borrowing under the [ Local Authority Home Loan
](/en/housing/owning-a-home/help-with-buying-a-home/local-authority-
mortgages/) must take out insurance through this scheme. For more information
on this see the [ FAQâ€™s on the Local Authority Home Loan website.
