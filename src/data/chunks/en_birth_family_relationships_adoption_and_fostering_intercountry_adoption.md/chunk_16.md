###  Getting an adoption certificate

When the adoption has been registered, it will appear on the Register of
Intercountry Adoptions. The register has details of the adopted child and the
adoptive parents. It is a public register and is open to scrutiny by members
of the public.

You can get a certified copy (an official copy) of an entry in the Register of
Intercountry Adoptions, which can be used for legal and administrative
purposes, for â‚¬20 per copy. You can [ download an application form to get a
copy of an adoption certificate (pdf)
](https://aai.gov.ie/images/PDFs/Application-for-a-copy-of-an-entry-in-the-
register-of-intercountry-adoptions.pdf) from the Adoption Authority website.

The adoption certificate has the same status as a birth certificate.
