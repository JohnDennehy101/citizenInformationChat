##  What is intercountry adoption?

If you adopt a child who lives in a country outside Ireland, the process is
called intercountry adoption. If you adopt a child who is resident in Ireland,
it is called [ domestic adoption ](/en/birth-family-relationships/adoption-
and-fostering/domestic-adoption/) .

When you adopt a child, they become a member of your family. Adoption creates
a legal relationship between the adoptive parents and the child.

As intercountry adoption is a complex legal process, you should get legal
advice from a solicitor who specialises in intercountry adoption. See 'More
information about intercountry adoption' below.
