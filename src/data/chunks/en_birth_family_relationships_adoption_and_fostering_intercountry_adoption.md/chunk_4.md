##  Being assessed for eligibility to adopt

Before you can adopt a child from another country, you must undergo an
assessment of your eligibility and suitability. The assessment is carried out
by a social worker from the [ Tusla intercountry adoption service
](https://www.tusla.ie/get-in-touch/inter-country-adoption-services/) , or an
accredited body.

The social worker will then prepare an ‘intercountry adoption assessment
report’ (also called a home-study report). The report goes before the local
adoption committee, who will then make a recommendation.

Next, the Adoption Authority will review:

  * Your application for assessment 
  * The social worker’s report 
  * The local adoption committee’s recommendations 

If all documents are in place and correct, and the recommendations are
positive, the Adoption Authority will grant you a [ declaration of eligibility
and suitability (pdf) ](https://www.aai.gov.ie/images/PDFs/Rules---
Eligibility-and-Suitability_updated.pdf) .
