###  Step 4: The adoption

Most countries allow you to adopt the child in the country of origin.

However, some countries may give you _guardianship_ of the child first, with
the expectation that you get a [ domestic adoption ](/en/birth-family-
relationships/adoption-and-fostering/domestic-adoption/) on your return to
Ireland.

Similarly, some countries will give you guardianship of the child, with the
requirement that you complete ‘post-placement reports’ for a certain length of
time, before they finalise the adoption in the courts of the country of
origin.
