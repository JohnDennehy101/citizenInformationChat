##  Introduction

If you own a business in Ireland, you must make sure your business is tax
compliant and that you make tax returns annually. The type of tax you pay
depends on whether you register as a [ sole trader, partnership or company
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/employment/types-of-employment/self-
employment/starting-a-business/#9960e7) .

This page outlines the tax obligations you must meet as a sole trader or
partnership in Ireland.

Companies are treated differently to sole traders and partnerships for tax
purposes. This is because a business that’s registered as a company is a
separate legal entity (it is separate from the person or partners who run it).
You can find information on [ tax for companies on Revenue’s website
