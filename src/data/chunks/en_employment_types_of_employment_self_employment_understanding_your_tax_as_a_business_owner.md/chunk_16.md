###  **How do I file a partnership tax return?**

On or before 31 October each year:

  * Each partnership must complete and submit a [ Form 1 Firms (pdf) ](https://www.revenue.ie/en/self-assessment-and-self-employment/documents/form1-firms.pdf) to Revenue (one person in the partnership submits this form) 
  * Each individual partner must make a self-assessment tax return on Form 11 using [ Revenue Online Service (ROS) ](https://www.ros.ie/) . 

This then determines how much tax each partner is liable to pay.
