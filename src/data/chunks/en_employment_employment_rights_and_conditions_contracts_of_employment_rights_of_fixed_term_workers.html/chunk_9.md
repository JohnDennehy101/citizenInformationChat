####  Objective grounds

Employers can only treat you less favourably if they have _objective grounds_
. This means the difference in treatment is appropriate and necessary for
achieving a legitimate business objective.

An example of objective grounds could be not providing you with a company car,
even though a comparable permanent worker has one. This could be justified as
legitimate because of the disproportionate cost to your employer of providing
the car to you when you are on a fixed-term contract.
