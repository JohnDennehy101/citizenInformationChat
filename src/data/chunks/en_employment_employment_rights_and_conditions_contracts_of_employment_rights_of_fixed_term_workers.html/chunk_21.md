####  Ending the contract early

Employers can include a termination clause and notice period in the fixed-term
contract allowing you or your employer to end the contract with notice before
the contract expires.

However, any termination clause must not fundamentally undermine the essential
purpose or term of the contract.

Any termination and notice provisions must be brought to your attention before
you enter into the contract.

If your contract does not state a notice period, the [ Minimum Notice and
Terms of Employment Act 1973
](https://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1973/act/4/enacted/en/print.html)
applies.
