##  Introduction

Generally, people employed on fixed-term contracts have the same rights as
other employees.

For example, employees with fixed-term contracts have the normal entitlement
to [ annual leave ](/en/employment/employment-rights-and-conditions/leave-and-
holidays/annual-leave/) , [ maternity leave ](/en/employment/employment-
rights-and-conditions/leave-and-holidays/maternity-leave/) , and [ payslips
](/en/employment/employment-rights-and-conditions/pay-and-employment/pay-
slip/) .

The rights of fixed-term workers are protected in law. You cannot generally be
treated _less favourably_ â€“ in other words, you must be treated **at least as
well** as comparable permanent employees.
