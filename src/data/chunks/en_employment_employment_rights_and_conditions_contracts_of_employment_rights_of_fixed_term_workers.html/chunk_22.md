###  **Dismissal at the end of a contract is not considered unfair**

Dismissal at the end of a fixed-term or specified-purpose contract may be
considered unfair under the Unfair Dismissals Acts.

However, the employer can prevent this by meeting these 3 conditions:

  * The contract must be in writing and must set out the specific duration of the fixed-term contract or, in the case of a specified-purpose contract, the object of the contract. 
  * The contract must be signed by both the employee and the employer. 
  * The contract must contain a specific clause stating that the expiry of the contract will not make it liable to a claim under the Unfair Dismissals Acts.
