##  Ending fixed-term contracts

Reasons for ending a fixed-term contract include the:

  * Reaching a specific date 
  * Finishing a specific task or project 
  * Occurrence of a specific event 

Not renewing a fixed-term contract is treated as a dismissal. When you are
dismissed at the end of the contract you may have:

  * Rights under unfair dismissals legislation (there are exceptions â€“ see below) 
  * Rights to a redundancy payment (only if you worked continuously for at least 104 weeks under a fixed-term or specified purpose contract)
