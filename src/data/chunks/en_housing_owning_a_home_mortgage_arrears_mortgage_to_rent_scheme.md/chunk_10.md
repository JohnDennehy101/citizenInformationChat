###  After the sale

The proceeds from the sale of your home will go towards your mortgage debt and
you come to an arrangement with your lender for the remaining balance that you
owe, if any. This remaining balance is now an _unsecured_ debt. (A _secured_
debt is a loan on which goods or property are available as security against
non-payment â€“ for example a housing mortgage, where you offer the property as
security and it may be repossessed if you cannot pay the mortgage.)

You will no longer own your property but you can continue living in your home
as a social housing tenant and you will have a tenancy agreement with the
housing association, or the local authority if a private company buys your
home. Once the property is sold under the mortgage-to-rent scheme, the buyer
is responsible for the maintenance and repair of the property as set out in
your tenancy agreement.

If your financial situation improves, you will have an option to buy your home
back from the housing association or approved private company after 5 years,
or earlier if agreed.
