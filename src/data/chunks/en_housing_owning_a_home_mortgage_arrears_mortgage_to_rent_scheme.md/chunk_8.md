##  How does the mortgage-to-rent scheme work?

Changing your status from owner to tenant of your home involves a complex set
of legal and financial arrangements, all of which must be signed off before
the transfer of property takes place.

When all these arrangements have been agreed, including the purchase price of
your home (see below) you voluntarily surrender possession of your home to
your mortgage lender. The lender immediately sells your home to a housing
association or approved private company, who will then rent it to you.

If an AHB buys the property they will own it and be your landlord. If an
approved private company buys your home they will own it, but your local
authority will be the landlord. See ‘Housing associations and approved private
companies’ below.
