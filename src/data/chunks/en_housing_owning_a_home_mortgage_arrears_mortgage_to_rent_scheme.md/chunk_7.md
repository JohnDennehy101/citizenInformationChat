###  Getting advice

You must get legal and financial advice before the mortgage-to-rent process
can go ahead.

Your lender will pay up to €500 for legal advice.

If you wish, your lender will also pay €250 for you to get financial advice
from an accountant on the [ Mortgage Arrears Information and Advice Service
panel
](http://www.keepingyourhome.ie/mortgage_arrears_information_and_advice_service/index.html)
.

The [ Money Advice and Budgeting Service (MABS) ](/en/money-and-tax/personal-
finance/debt/mabs-service/) can provide debt advice, as well as general
information on the scheme.
