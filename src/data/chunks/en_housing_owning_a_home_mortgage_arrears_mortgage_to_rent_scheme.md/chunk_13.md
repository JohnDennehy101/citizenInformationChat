##  How to apply for the mortgage-to-rent scheme

Where appropriate, your lender will offer you the opportunity to apply for the
scheme and give you an application form for mortgage-to-rent. If you are
interested, you give consent in writing to your lender to submit your details
to a number of organisations involved in the scheme.

You then need to complete several steps:

  1. You apply for social housing support with your local authority. 
  2. You agree to surrender ownership of your home in exchange for a tenancy agreement with a housing association or local authority. 
  3. You complete your Mortgage to Rent application. 

The Housing Agency has published a Guide to the Mortgage to Rent Scheme.
