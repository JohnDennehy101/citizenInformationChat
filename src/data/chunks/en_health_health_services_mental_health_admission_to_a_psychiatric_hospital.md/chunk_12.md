###  What role could the Garda√≠ have?

A Garda can take you into custody if they have reasonable grounds for
believing you are suffering from a mental disorder and there is a serious risk
you may cause immediate and serious harm to yourself or another person.

The Garda may use force if necessary to enter the premises you are in. The
Garda must then follow the normal procedure for involuntary admission. They
must arrange for you to be examined by a doctor.
