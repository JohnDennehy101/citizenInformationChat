###  Involuntary admission of a child

The HSE can apply for a child to be admitted involuntarily if the child is:

  * Suffering from a mental disorder, and 
  * Needs treatment 

The HSE must apply to the District Court. The court will order a psychiatric
examination and may then make an order to admit the child to an approved
centre for up to 21 days. The child's admission can be extended.

The court must give specific approval for any psycho-surgery or electro-
convulsive therapy to be carried out on a child with a mental disorder.
