##  Introduction

If you are suffering from a **mental disorder** (see below), you may go into a
psychiatric hospital or unit voluntarily, or you may be committed as an
involuntary patient (against your will).

The vast majority of admissions to a psychiatric hospital are voluntary â€“ this
means that you freely agree to go for treatment.
