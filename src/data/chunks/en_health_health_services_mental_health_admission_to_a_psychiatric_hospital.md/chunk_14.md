###  Getting to an approved psychiatric centre

Usually, the person who applies to admit you is responsible for taking you to
the centre. If this is not possible, the doctor who recommended your admission
can ask the clinical director of the centre or a consultant psychiatrist
acting on their behalf to arrange for the centre's staff to bring you to the
centre.

If necessary, the Gardaí may be asked to help. In this case, the Gardaí may
enter by force the premises you are in. They may detain or restrain you if
necessary.
