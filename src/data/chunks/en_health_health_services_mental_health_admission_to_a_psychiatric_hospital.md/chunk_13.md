##  2\. Medical assessment

When a doctor receives an application to admit you, they must examine you
within 24 hours of receiving the application. The examining doctor cannot be a
relative and cannot work for an approved centre.

The doctor must tell you the purpose of the examination unless they consider
it would not be good for your mental health, well-being or emotional
condition.

If the doctor thinks you are suffering from a mental disorder, they will
recommend that you be admitted to hospital (an approved centre). This
recommendation remains in force for 7 days.

If the doctor refuses the application and a subsequent application is made,
the applicant must inform the doctor about the previous application, if aware
of it.

Normally, you will be admitted to an approved psychiatric hospital. You will
only be moved to the Central Mental Hospital if a [ mental health tribunal
](https://www.mhcirl.ie/what-we-do/mental-health-tribunals) approves it.
