##  Introduction

If you are pregnant and getting a social welfare payment, you may be able to
continue to get your payment as long as you satisfy the conditions, or
transfer to another payment that better suits your needs.

This page explains how pregnancy is treated if you are getting [ Jobseeker’s
Benefit ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/social-welfare-
payments/unemployed-people/jobseekers-benefit/) , [ Jobseeker’s Allowance
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/social-welfare-
payments/unemployed-people/jobseekers-allowance/) , [ Illness Benefit
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/social-welfare-
payments/disability-and-illness/disability-benefit/) , [ One-Parent Family
Payment ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/social-welfare-

employment scheme
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/employment/unemployment-and-
redundancy/employment-support-schemes/schemes-to-support-employment/) .

**Pregnancy and Maternity Benefit**

If you are on [ maternity leave
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/employment/employment-rights-and-
conditions/leave-and-holidays/maternity-leave/) from work and have paid enough
[ social insurance (PRSI) ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-
welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/social-insurance-prsi/social-insurance/) ,
you can get Maternity Benefit. You should apply for [ Maternity Benefit
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/social-welfare-
payments/families-and-children/maternity-benefit/) at least 6 weeks before you
plan to go on maternity leave or 12 weeks if you are self-employed.

If you don’t qualify for Maternity Benefit, you may be able to stay on your
current payment or you may qualify for another payment.
