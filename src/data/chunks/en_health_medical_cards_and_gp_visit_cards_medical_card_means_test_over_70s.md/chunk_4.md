###  **Medical card basic rates for couples**

The assessment of a couple is based on the age of the older person.

**Your spouse or partner is aged under 70 years:** Where only one of you is
aged over 70 years, you will both qualify for a medical card if your combined
income is not over â‚¬1,050 a week.

**Surviving spouse or partner:** If your spouse, civil partner or cohabiting
partner dies and you are aged over 70, you can keep your medical card for 3
years, provided that your income remains less than the limit for a couple.
After 3 years, the relevant income limit for a single person applies.

If you are aged under 70 when your spouse, civil partner or cohabiting partner
dies, [ the relevant income limit for a single person
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/health/medical-cards-and-gp-visit-
