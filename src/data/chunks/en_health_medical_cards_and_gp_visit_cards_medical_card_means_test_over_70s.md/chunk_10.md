##  Savings and investments assessment

Your savings and investments are also reviewed by the HSE in the means test
for a [ medical card ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/health/medical-
cards-and-gp-visit-cards/medical-card/) .

Savings and investments of up to €36,000 for a single person, and up to
€72,000 for a couple, are disregarded.

Interest on savings or investments over the limit is taken into account in the
means test.

This means that only the interest or income earned on your savings and
investments will be counted as income, not the total value of the savings or
investments themselves.
