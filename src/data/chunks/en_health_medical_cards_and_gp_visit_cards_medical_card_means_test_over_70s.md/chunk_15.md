###  **Property that is not rented**

**If you are** **aged over 70,** income will not be assessed from your
property that is not generating a rental income.

**If you are** [ **aged under 70** ](/en/health/medical-cards-and-gp-visit-
cards/medical-card-means-test-over-70s/) and have unused land or buildings
that you are not renting, but could be leased or sold, the HSE reviews the
value of the property as a savings and investment assessment (above).
