###  **How does the HSE assess interest?**

There are different ways the HSE can assess your savings and investments. They
can use:

  * A Certificate of Interest (usually from your bank) of all your savings, or 
  * Copies of bank statements showing the current balance on your account or account 

If you have stocks or shares, you will need to provide a copy of your current
Share Certificates showing shareholdings.

The HSE can calculate your weekly income from savings and investments using
the following rules:

**Capital** |  **Weekly means assessed**  
---|---  
First €36,000 (single), €72,000 (couple)  |  Nil   
Next €10,000  |  €1 per €1,000   
Next €10,000  |  €2 per €1,000   
More than €56,000 (single) or €92,000 (couple)  |  €4 per €1,000   
  
For example, if you are a couple and have €90,000 in savings, any income on
the first €72,000 will not be considered. The income on the next €10,000 will
be considered at €1 per €1,000 totalling €10. The balance of €8,000 will be
considered at €2 per €1,000 totalling €16.
