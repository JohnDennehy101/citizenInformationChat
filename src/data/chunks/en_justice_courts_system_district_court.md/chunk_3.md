##  Civil matters

**Local jurisdiction**

Civil cases must be brought, heard and decided in the correct District Court
area.

If you are the **respondent** , you must bring the case to the District Court
area where you or one of the respondents lives or works.

If you are the **claimant** , you can choose a different District Court area
depending on the type of case:

  * In proceedings based on contract, you can choose the District Court area where the contract was made 
  * In proceedings based on tort (personal injuries actions), you can choose the District Court area where the injury is alleged to have happened 
  * In proceedings to evict a person from land or property, you can choose the District Court area where the land or property is located 

A District Court can only hear a case that has been commenced in the correct
District Court area.
