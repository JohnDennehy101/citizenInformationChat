This option is not available for the following offences:

If the judge decides that a case cannot be dealt with by the [ District Court
](/en/justice/courts-system/district-court/) , the accused person is sent
forward to the [ Circuit Court ](/en/justice/courts-system/circuit-court/) for
sentence. At the Circuit Court, they can withdraw their guilty plea and change
it to, not guilty. If this happens, the accused person will face a trial with
a jury present.
