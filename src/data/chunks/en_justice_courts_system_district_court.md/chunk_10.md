####  **Indictable offences which cannot be tried summarily in the District
Court**

Certain cases must be heard by a judge and jury and cannot be tried summarily
in the District Court. In these cases, the accused is served with a Book of
Evidence, which includes:

  * A statement of the charge 
  * A statement of the evidence to be introduced to the court 
  * A list of witnesses and exhibits 

The District Court Judge will send the accused forward to the Circuit Court or
Central Criminal Court for trial once the book of evidence has been served and
the DPP has agreed to send the case forward.
