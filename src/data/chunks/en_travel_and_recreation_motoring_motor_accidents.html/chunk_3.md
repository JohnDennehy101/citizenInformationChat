##  What are my legal obligations?

If you are involved in a motor collision, your legal obligations are set out
in [ Section 106 of the Road Traffic Act 1961 (as amended)
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1961/en/act/pub/0024/sec0106.html#zza24y1961s106)
.

**Stay at the scene:** You must stop your car and remain at the location of
the accident for a reasonable time.

**Provide information:** If a Garda is present at the scene of the collision,
you must give them, when requested:

  * Your name and address 
  * The address where your car is kept 
  * The name and address of the car owner 
  * The cars registration number 
  * Motor insurance details (including the expiry date of the policy) 

If there is no Garda present, you must give this information on request to:

  * The injured person (where someone has been hurt) â€“ or a person asking on their behalf 
  * The owner whose property has been damaged or someone asking on their behalf 

If none of these people are present, give the information to an independent
person who was present when the collision occurred.

**Report the accident:** If there is no Garda present, you must report the
accident as soon as possible to a Garda nearby or at a Garda station. The
person (if any) you gave the information can do this. If they cannot do so,
you must report the accident.
