###  Income from employment

Your income from a job is assessed. Your assessable weekly earnings (gross
income less PRSI, union dues and superannuation fees) are usually assessed on
the basis of the 13 weeks before you claim. Not all of your income is taken
into account. €20 per day (up to a maximum of €60) is deducted from your
assessable weekly earnings and then 60% of the balance is assessed as weekly
means.

Any income from an occupational pension is assessed in full. If you have
seasonal work, you are assessed on your earnings only during the period you
are actually working.

Your spouse, civil partner or cohabitant's income from employment is assessed
in the same way (€20 per day with a maximum of €60 is deducted and 60% of the
balance is assessed as weekly means).

People who were getting Farm Assist before 26 September 2007 and who were
still in payment on 26 September 2007 may be assessed differently.
