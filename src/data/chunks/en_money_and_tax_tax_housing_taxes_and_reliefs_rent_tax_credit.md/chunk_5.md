###  Registration of your tenancy

Your tenancy must be registered with the Residential Tenancy Board (RTB),
unless it is a type of tenancy where this is not required, called a [ licence
arrangement ](https://www.rtb.ie/register-a-tenancy/is-your-property-exempt-
from-registration-1) . This includes where you are [ sharing with the owner
](/en/housing/renting-a-home/tenants-rights-and-responsibilities/sharing-
accommodation-with-your-landlord/) in a [ rent-a-room ](/en/housing/owning-a-
home/home-owners/renting-a-room-in-your-home/) or digs arrangement.

In some cases, only the types of tenancies that are required to be registered
with the RTB are eligible for the credit, so rent-a-room or digs arrangements
are not included. This applies if:

  * You are related to your landlord or 
  * You are claiming for a property that is used by your child 

You can [ check the register with the RTB ](https://www.rtb.ie/check-register)
.

It was announced in [ Budget 2024 ](/en/money-and-tax/budgets/budget-2024/)
that this will change so that you will be able claim for rent for digs or
rent-a-room arrangements if you pay rent for your child who is attending an
approved course. This change will also apply retrospectively for 2022 and
2023.

If your tenancy is registered, the RTB has information on [ how to find the
Registered Tenancy (RT) number ](https://www.rtb.ie/beginning-a-tenancy/types-
of-tenancy-agreements-and-leases) . You will be asked for the RT number when
you apply for the tax credit. If you cannot provide the RT number when you
apply, Revenue may ask you for it later.
