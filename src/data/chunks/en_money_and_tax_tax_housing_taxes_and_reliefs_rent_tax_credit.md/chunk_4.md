##  Can I claim the Rent Tax Credit?

You can claim the credit for rent payments you have made for:

  * Your home 
  * A second home in Ireland that you use to take part in your work or [ an approved course ](https://www.revenue.ie/en/personal-tax-credits-reliefs-and-exemptions/education/tuition-fees-paid-for-third-level-education/approved-colleges-and-courses.aspx)
  * A property that is used by your child to take part in [ an approved course ](https://www.revenue.ie/en/personal-tax-credits-reliefs-and-exemptions/education/tuition-fees-paid-for-third-level-education/approved-colleges-and-courses.aspx) , if they are under 23 at the start of the year in which they begin the course 

The rent payments must be for a home that is in Ireland.

You cannot claim for rent payments on a property that you get housing support
for, including:

  * [ The Housing Assistance Payment ](/en/housing/renting-a-home/help-with-renting/housing-assistance-payment/)
  * [ Rent Supplement ](/en/social-welfare/supplementary-welfare-schemes/rent-supplement/)
  * [ The Rental Accommodation Scheme ](/en/housing/local-authority-and-social-housing/rental-accommodation-scheme/)
  * [ Cost rental housing ](/en/housing/renting-a-home/help-with-renting/cost-rental-housing/)

This is the case even if you make a top-up payment in addition to the housing
support you get.
