###  Mandatory terms of a DSA

There are certain elements that the DSA **must** contain:

  * The maximum duration of the agreement must be 5 years but this may be extended by up to one year in circumstances as specified in the terms of the arrangement 
  * If you keep to the terms of the agreement your remaining debts to the creditors covered by the DSA will be discharged 
  * You remain liable for certain debts unless the proposed arrangement explicitly provides for a compromise agreement and the creditor has agreed in writing to accept this – see ‘Excluded debts’ and ‘Excludable debts’ above 
  * The DSA cannot release you from fines or other monetary penalties arising from criminal offences 
  * It cannot require you to sell any assets that are reasonably necessary for your employment or business unless you agree to such a sale 
  * You must be left with enough income to maintain a reasonable standard of living for yourself and your dependants 
  * It must not require you to dispose of your principal private residence (your home) or to cease to occupy it unless specific conditions are met 
  * It must outline how your debts will be treated in the event of your death or mental incapacity 
  * It must provide that your circumstances be reviewed by the Personal Insolvency Practitioner at regular intervals (not more than 12 months) during the currency of the DSA; this review will involve the preparation of a new Prescribed Financial Statement that must be sent to all the creditors. 
  * It must make provision for the Personal Insolvency Practitioner’s costs
