##  Am I eligible?

Debt Settlement Arrangements provide for the agreed settlement of debts in the
case of people who have _unsecured_ debts and have no prospect of being able
to pay off their debts in the next 5 years. You may opt for a DSA if you have
_secured_ debts as well, but your secured debts will not be covered by the
DSA. See ‘Secured and unsecured debts’ below for an explanation of these
terms.

You can only avail of a DSA once in your lifetime. You cannot get a DSA if you
are involved in one of the other debt resolution processes introduced by the
Act, or in the [ bankruptcy ](/en/money-and-tax/personal-
finance/debt/personal-insolvency/what-is-bankruptcy/) process. Nor can you get
a DSA if you have completed a [ Personal Insolvency Arrangement ](/en/money-
and-tax/personal-finance/debt/personal-insolvency/personal-insolvency-
arrangements/) or a bankruptcy within the last 5 years, or a [ Debt Relief
Notice ](/en/money-and-tax/personal-finance/debt/personal-insolvency/debt-
relief-notices/) within the last 3 years.

You can only get a DSA by agreement of a specified majority of your unsecured
creditors – see [ Main elements of a DSA
](debt_settlement_arrangements.en.html#l2cc15) below.

Before you make your application, you must either be domiciled in the State
or, within the year, have been living in the State or had a place of business
in the State.
