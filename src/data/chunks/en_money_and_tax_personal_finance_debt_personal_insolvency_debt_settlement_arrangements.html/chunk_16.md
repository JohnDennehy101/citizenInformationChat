###  Protective certificate

The Personal Insolvency Practitioner sends your application to the Insolvency
Service. The ISI checks that all the details are in order and, if so, issues a
certificate to that effect and forwards all the documentation to the relevant
court (the Circuit Court in cases up to €2.5 million and the High Court in
larger cases). The court reviews the documentation and, if all is in order,
issues a protective certificate. The Insolvency Service records the details of
the protective certificate on its Register of Protective Certificates.

The Personal Insolvency Practitioner then notifies each of your creditors of
the existence of the protective certificate and your intention to make a
proposal for a DSA.

The protective certificate will give you an initial period of 70 days during
which your creditors may not:

  * Start or continue legal proceedings in respect of the debt 
  * Take or continue any steps to enforce a judgment or contact you about the debt unless you agree to this 
  * Start or continue bankruptcy proceedings against you 

The court may extend the period of the protective certificate by up to 40 days
if it is satisfied that:

  * You and the Personal Insolvency Practitioner have acted in good faith and with reasonable expedition, and 
  * It is likely that, if the extension is granted, a proposal for a DSA will be made that is likely to be accepted by the creditors and successfully completed by you 

The court may also extend the period of the protective certificate by up to 40
days, or by a further period up to 40 days, where there are exceptional
circumstances or other circumstances outside your or the PIP’s control.

A creditor may apply to the court for an order directing that the protective
certificate not apply to him or her. The court will grant this order only if
satisfied that failing to give it would cause irreparable loss to the creditor
that would not otherwise occur and that no other creditor to whom notice of
the protective certificate has been given would be unfairly prejudiced.
