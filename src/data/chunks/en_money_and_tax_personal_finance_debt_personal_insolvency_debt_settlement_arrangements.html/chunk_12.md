###  Credit

While the DSA is in effect, you may not get credit for any amount over â‚¬650
without informing the lender that you have a DSA. You may not sell or deal in
property above a certain value, except in accordance with the terms of the
DSA. However, no such restriction is placed on your spouse or civil partner.
