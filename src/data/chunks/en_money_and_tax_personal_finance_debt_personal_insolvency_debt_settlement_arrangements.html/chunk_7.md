###  Excludable debts

The Act specifies certain other types of debt to be _excludable_ from a DSA.
This means that they can be covered by the DSA if the creditor is asked and
agrees to let them be included – in which case they become _permitted_ debts –
debts that the creditor permits to be covered. If the creditor is asked and
does not respond, the creditor will also have been deemed to have consented to
the debts being included. Most types of excludable debts are those owed to the
State.

The types of debt that are _excludable_ and may be covered if the creditor
agrees are:

  * Taxes, duties, charges or levies owed to the State, such as income tax, the [ Local Property Tax ](/en/money-and-tax/tax/housing-taxes-and-reliefs/local-property-tax/) , [ VAT ](/en/money-and-tax/tax/duties-and-vat/value-added-tax/) , capital taxes 
  * Service charges owed to local authorities 
  * Rates 
  * Money owed under the [ Nursing Homes Support Scheme ](/en/health/health-services/health-services-for-older-people/fair-deal-scheme/) (in respect of a loan advanced by the HSE to a nursing home resident to cover the amount due from the principal private residence) 
  * Money owed to the Department of Social Protection, such as overpayments 
  * Debts due to [ owners’ management companies ](/en/housing/owning-a-home/home-owners/management-companies-for-apartment-blocks/) in respect of annual service charges or contributions due for multi-unit developments (this is the only non-State debt in this category)
