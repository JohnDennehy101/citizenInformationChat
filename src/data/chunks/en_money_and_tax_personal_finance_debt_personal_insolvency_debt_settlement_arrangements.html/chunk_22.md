###  Varying or ending a Debt Settlement Arrangement

Debt Settlement Arrangements may be **varied** if there is a material change
in a debtor’s circumstances that would affect his/her ability to make
repayments under the DSA – the procedures are similar to those for setting up
the arrangement.

A creditor or a PIP may apply to the court at any time during the Debt
Settlement Arrangement to have it **ended** . The grounds for such an
application will be limited and include the following:

  * Your Prescribed Financial Statement has a material inaccuracy or omission that causes a material detriment to the creditor 
  * You did not meet the eligibility criteria when you started the process 
  * You did not comply with the terms of the Debt Settlement Arrangement 
  * You have committed an offence under the personal insolvency legislation since the arrangement came into effect 
  * You are in arrears with your payments for a period of not less than 3 months 

The full list of grounds is in [ Section 83 of the Personal Insolvency Act
2012 ](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2012/en/act/pub/0044/sec0083.html#sec83)
.

If you are in arrears with your payments for more than 6 months, the DSA will
be deemed to have failed. This will be recorded in the Register of Debt
Settlement Arrangements.
