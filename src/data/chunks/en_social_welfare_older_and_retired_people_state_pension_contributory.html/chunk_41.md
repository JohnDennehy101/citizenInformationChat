###  **Example of how the rate of SPC is calculated in 2027**

**Example of how someone’s rate of State Pension (Contributory) is calculated
in 2027**  
---  
Mary will be 69 when she applies for her State Pension (Contributory) in 2027.
The Department of Social Protection (DSP) will calculate her rate of pension
using both the:  • Total Contribution Approach, and  • The yearly average
method  
**Step 1:** The DSP checks the total number of Mary’s contributions, using the
TCA.  
**Step 2:** The DSP then calculates Mary’s ‘yearly average’.  If her rate of
pension using the TCA is higher than when using the yearly average, Mary gets
the rate from the TCA calculation.  But, if the yearly average calculation
gives a higher rate, the DSP continues their calculations (see Step 3).  
**Step 3:** In 2027, the DSP will add 70% of the SPC rate Mary will get using
the yearly average, and 30% of her TCA pension rate.  70% (YA) + 30% (TCA) =
Mary’s final SPC rate.  
  
To get a State Pension (Contributory), you must have started paying PRSI **at
least 10 years** before you reach the age of 66 or the [ age you defer your
