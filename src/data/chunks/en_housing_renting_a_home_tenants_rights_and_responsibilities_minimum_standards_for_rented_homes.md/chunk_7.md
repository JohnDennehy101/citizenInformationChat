###  Damage to your possessions

Your landlord's responsibilities do not normally cover you for any damage to
your possessions. For example, your landlord is responsible for keeping the
water pipes in good repair, but if your belongings are damaged because of
burst pipes the landlord is not responsible for replacing your belongings.
Also, the landlord's insurance policy is unlikely to cover your personal
belongings.

Several insurance companies provide contents insurance for private tenants.

The housing charity Threshold has useful information and guidance for [ how to
deal with repairs ](https://www.threshold.ie/advice/dealing-with-problems-
