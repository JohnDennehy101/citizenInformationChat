####  Book an appointment

Ask your GP if they have signed up to the [ Free Contraception Scheme
](https://www.gov.ie/en/campaigns/bc079-free-contraception-scheme/) and that
the service will be provided free of charge.

Your GP may refer you to another GP if they do not have expertise in fitting
certain forms of contraception.

Book an appointment with a GP or doctor to discuss your contraception. This
appointment will be free.

doctor about your contraception ](https://sexualwellbeing.ie/sexual-
health/contraception/talking-about-contraception/talking-to-your-gp-or-
doctor/talking-to-your-gp-doctor.html) .

If you do not have a GP, do not want to go to a GP or your GP does not take
part in the Free Contraception Scheme, you can also get free contraception
from some family planning clinics, womenâ€™s health clinics, student health
clinics or health centres.
