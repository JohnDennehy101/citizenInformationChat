###  Contracts

In a debt context, a contract is an agreement by one party to provide goods or
services for another in return for payment. In general, contracts do not have
to be in writing to be enforceable. However, contracts for the sale of land
and contracts governed by the [ Consumer Credit Act 1995
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1995/en/act/pub/0024/index.html) must be in
writing to be enforceable.

Not paying is a breach of the contract. Contracts may have penalty clauses for
not meeting the terms of the contract. So, for example, the contract may say
you must pay an extra charge or interest if you don't pay on time.
