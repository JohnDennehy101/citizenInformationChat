###  Protective certificate

This is a certificate issued by a court to protect the debtor against legal
proceedings by a creditor while a **Personal Insolvency Arrangement (PIA)** or
a **Debt Settlement Arrangement (DSA)** is being put in place.

The protective certificate gives you 70 days during which your **creditors**
must not:

  * Start or continue legal proceedings in respect of the debt 
  * Take or continue any steps to enforce a judgment or contact you about the debt unless you agree to this 
  * Start or continue bankruptcy proceedings against you.
