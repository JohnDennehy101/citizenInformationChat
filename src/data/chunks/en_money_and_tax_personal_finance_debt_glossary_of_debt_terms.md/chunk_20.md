###  Debt Settlement Arrangement (DSA)

The [ Debt Settlement Arrangement ](/en/money-and-tax/personal-
finance/debt/personal-insolvency/debt-settlement-arrangements/) is a debt
solution for _unsecured_ debts, usually over a period of 5 years. (See
**Secured loan** below for definition.) The limit of 5 years can increase to 6
years in some situations. When the DSA concludes successfully, the debts that
it covers will be fully settled.
