###  Debts and criminal offences

Most debts arise because you have failed to meet the terms of a contract. For
example, you borrow money from the bank or credit union and you don't pay it
back, or you enter into an agreement to buy equipment by instalments and you
don't pay. It is a breach of contract to not pay your debts - it is not
generally a criminal offence.

However, it is a criminal offence to not pay certain debts. For example, it is
an offence not to pay your taxes or your TV licence fee. You may be charged
and convicted for failure to pay such debts. Even if you are charged,
convicted and fined, you still owe the debt and can be sued for it in the
normal way.
