###  Priority debt

The term _priority debt_ can be used in a general sense but it can also have a
specific legal meaning. If you owe money to a number of **creditors** , you
have your own view of which of these debts take priority. Most people would
regard the repayments on their home as taking priority over the repayment of
some other loans.

The legal meaning of _priority debt_ may be different. For example, in
receiverships, liquidations and **bankruptcy** , the law sets out the order in
which the debts must be paid.
