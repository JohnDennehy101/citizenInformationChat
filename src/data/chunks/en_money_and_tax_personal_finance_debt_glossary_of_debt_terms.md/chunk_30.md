###  Prescribed Financial Statement

A [ Prescribed Financial Statement (PFS)
](http://www.isi.gov.ie/en/ISI/Pages/Prescribed_Financial_Statement) is a
written statement of a debtorâ€™s financial affairs. Every applicant must
complete a PFS with the help of an **Approved Intermediary** (for a **Debt
Relief Notice** ) or a **Personal Insolvency Practitioner** (for a [ Debt
Settlement Arrangement ](/en/money-and-tax/personal-finance/debt/personal-
insolvency/debt-settlement-arrangements/) or [ Personal Insolvency Arrangement
](/en/money-and-tax/personal-finance/debt/personal-insolvency/personal-
insolvency-arrangements/) ).

The PFS is used to:

  * See if you are eligible for a debt resolution mechanism 
  * Calculate the contribution to be paid to your creditors over the period of a [ Debt Settlement Arrangement ](/en/money-and-tax/personal-finance/debt/personal-insolvency/debt-settlement-arrangements/) or [ Personal Insolvency Arrangement ](/en/money-and-tax/personal-finance/debt/personal-insolvency/personal-insolvency-arrangements/) . 
  * Find which debts will no longer apply at the end of an arrangement
