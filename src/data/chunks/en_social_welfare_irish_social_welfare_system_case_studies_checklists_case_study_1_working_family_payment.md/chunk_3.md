###  Case study

Mary has 3 children. Her youngest 2 children are 5 and 7 years old. She is
getting a [ One-Parent Family Payment (OFP) ](/en/social-welfare/families-and-
children/one-parent-family-payment/) and was recently offered work part-time.

If she takes the job, she will work 3 days each week and earn €300. Mary wants
to take the job as all her children are now in school, but she knows her One-
Parent Family Payment will be affected.

Would Mary be better off financially if she takes the job offer?

She has lived in her home for 20 years and has a small mortgage. She gets a
weekly maintenance payment of €80 for her mortgage costs, which does not
affect her One-Parent Family Payment. Her 18-year-old daughter is a student
and has a part-time job in a local shop.
