###  Note 2

If Mary gets €300 from employment, her One-Parent Family Payment will be
reduced.

  * The first €165 of Mary’s income from employment is disregarded (not included) in the means test for OFP (€300 - €165 = €135) 
  * The Department will assess 50% of the remaining €135, which is €67.50, as Mary’s means 

A person with means of €67.50 gets an OFP payment of €172. Mary also gets €46
for each child under 12, and €54 for her child that is 12 and over.

So, her total weekly OFP payment will be €318 (€172 + €46 + €46 + €54 = €318).
