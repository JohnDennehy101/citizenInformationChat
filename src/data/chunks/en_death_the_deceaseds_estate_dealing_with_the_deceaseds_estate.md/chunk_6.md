####  If there is no will

The person who deals with the deceased person’s estate is called an
**‘administrator’** . An administrator may also be appointed if:

  * There is a will but no executor has been appointed 
  * The appointed person cannot act as executor 
  * The executor cannot or will not carry out their duties 

The administrator needs to take out a _Letter of Administration_ (or a _Letter
of Administration with Will Annexed_ if there is a will).

Usually, the next of kin applies for a grant of administration. Priority is
given in the following order:

  * Spouse or civil partner 
  * Child 
  * Parent 
  * Brother or sister 
  * More distant relative 

The Probate Registrar will make a decision if there is doubt about who is
entitled to be the administrator. The administrator must give an
administration bond to the Probate Office - this is a sort of guarantee that
you will carry out your duties properly.

The duties of the executor and administrator are broadly the same. If you are
not sure about these roles, you should get legal advice from a solicitor (see
‘Do I need a solicitor?’ below).
