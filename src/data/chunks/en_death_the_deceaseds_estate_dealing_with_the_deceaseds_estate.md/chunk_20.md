##  Can I get a copy of a will?

Once a grant of probate (or letters of administration) has been issued,
anybody can apply for copies of the grant and the will. You can [ search the
Probate Register online ](http://probate.courts.ie/probate.nsf) for grants
that have been issued.

To apply for a copy of the grant or will, you must complete the [ Probate
Order Form (doc) ](https://www.courts.ie/acc/alfresco/114d1844-9ef0-491b-86ff-
affd57b22d84/Probate%20Office%20Order%20Form.docx/docx/1) and pay the relevant
fee. You can pay the fee by postal or money orders, or by cheques made out to
The Courts Service.

The grant sets out the name and address of the executor or administrator of
the estate and the name of the solicitor acting on their behalf (if any). It
also sets out the gross value and the net value of the estate.

Detailed information about the estate is not normally available to the general
public. However, certain people may be able to inspect the Notice of
Acknowledgement (formerly known as the Inland Revenue Affidavit).

They include:

  * A beneficiary who is named in the will 
  * Someone who is entitled to a share of the estate 
  * A person who is entitled to bring proceedings against the estate under Section 117 of the Succession Act 1965 

You can read more about searching the Probate Register and getting copies of
the grant or will [ on the Courts Service website
