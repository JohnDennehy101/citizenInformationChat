###  Step 3 â€“ Attending your appointment

You must attend the appointment in person. Your appointment will take place in
private. You do not have to appear in a courtroom.

You must bring the following with you:

  * Your photo ID 
  * The original will and codicils if there are any 

The Probate official will look at your documents and may ask you some
questions. They cannot give you legal advice.

Another appointment may have to be scheduled if there are queries that cannot
be settled at the first appointment. The official may ask you to withdraw your
personal application and, in some cases, may tell you to get a solicitor to
make the application on your behalf.

You will make an oath or affirmation before the official confirming all the
details of your application are true.

The Probate Office or Registry will send you a Grant of Representation by
post. This usually takes around 3 weeks.
