###  If the deceased dies in debt

If the deceased person dies insolvent or there isn't enough money to meet the
_bequests_ (the items left to someone in a will) made, payments from the
estate are prioritised in the following order:

  1. Funeral, testamentary and administration expenses – testamentary and administration expenses are the expenses incurred in dealing with your estate 
  2. Creditors who have security against the property of the deceased, for example mortgage providers 
  3. Preferential debts – these are mainly taxes and social insurance contributions due at the deceased person’s death 
  4. All other creditors 

Where the deceased person dies in debt, creditors can only bring a claim
against the estate of the deceased. Even if there isn't enough money in the
estate to meet all the debts, the relatives of the deceased are not personally
responsible for the deceased's debts (unless they had guaranteed them).
