###  Probate fees

Probate fees are higher for personal applications than those made by a
solicitor on your behalf. The Probate fee is calculated based on the net value
of the estate.

**Probate fees for personal applications** Value of estate less than  |  Fee   
---|---  
€100,000  |  €200   
€250,000  |  €400   
€500,000  |  €700   
€750,000  |  €1,000   
€1,000,000 (1 million)  |  €1,300   
  
Where the estate is valued at more than €1 million, the fee is increased by
€800 for every €500,000.

**For example** , if the value of the estate is €1.6 million, the fee would
be:

  * First €1 million: €1,300 
  * Remaining €600,000: the fee is €800 for every €500,000, and the amount left over is assessed as another €800 
  * The total fee is €2,900 

All the fees listed above are for personal applications only. If you are
making an application through a solicitor, the fees are half of those listed
above. Your solicitor will advise you of how much the process will cost in
total.
