###  Beneficiaries living abroad

If you are a beneficiary under an Irish will, you must supply a [ Personal
Public Service (PPS) number ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-
welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/personal-public-service-number/) before a
grant of probate can issue. If you live abroad and don’t have a PPS number,
you must apply to Client Identity Services (see ‘If you don’t have a PPS
number because you live abroad’ above).
