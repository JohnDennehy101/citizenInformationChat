###  Step 2 – The Personal Application Form

You must complete the [ Personal Application Form (doc)
](https://www.courts.ie/acc/alfresco/f3d7529f-33e8-485f-b6d4-c13361c73dca/Personal
Application Form.doc/doc/1) and send it to the District Probate Registry or
the Probate Office in Dublin (see ‘Further information and contacts’ below).

You must include:

  * The original [ death certificate ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/death/practical-arrangements-after-a-death/registering-a-death/#eaa472) (or a Coroner’s Interim Certificate of death if you have not received a death certificate yet) 
  * A photocopy of the will and codicils if there are any (do not send the original will) 
  * If the deceased person lived outside of Ireland, you should also send a Court Sealed and Certified copy of the Grant of Representation and will (if there is one) which was issued by the country where the deceased person lived 

The Probate Office or Registry may contact you to ask for more information or
documentation. You can read the Probate Office’s [ Guidance notes on
completing the Personal Application Form (pdf)
](https://www.courts.ie/acc/alfresco/a3983bc2-d22a-4d12-a6af-54d8db50735a/Guidelines%20to%20complete%20Personal%20App%20Form.pdf/pdf#view=fitH)
.

Once the Probate Office or Registry has everything it needs to proceed with
your application, you will be given an appointment to meet with an official at
the Probate Office or Registry.
