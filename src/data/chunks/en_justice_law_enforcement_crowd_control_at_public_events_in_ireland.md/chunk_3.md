##  Control of access to certain events

[ Section 21 of the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1994/en/act/pub/0002/sec0021.html#zza2y1994s21)
empowers the Gardaí to place barriers on roads up to one mile (1.6 km) from
where a particular event involving a large number of people is taking place.

The decision on the placing of barriers must be made by a Garda who is of
Superintendent rank or higher. When the barriers are in place the Gardaí are
allowed to prohibit you from crossing or passing the barrier if you do not
have a ticket for the event. The Garda may also seize any alcohol or
disposable drinks containers or any offensive article at the barrier before
allowing you to proceed to the event.

Section 21 allows you to pass the barriers if you are going home or travelling
to your place of work. You may also pass the barriers if you are going to any
place in the area of the event if it is for a lawful purpose.

Anyone who fails to obey the direction given by a Garda at a barrier will be
guilty of an offence and is liable to a [ class D fine ](/en/justice/criminal-
law/criminal-trial/fines-for-criminal-offences/) .
