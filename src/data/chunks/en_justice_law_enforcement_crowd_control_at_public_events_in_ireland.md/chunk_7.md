###  Public place

In the Act a number of offences are included which only become offences if
they are committed in a public place. For example, offences under Sections 4

place is broadly defined in Section 3 of the Act. It includes all public
outdoor areas, any indoor area which the public can lawfully access, such as
an open shop, public roads and public transport.
