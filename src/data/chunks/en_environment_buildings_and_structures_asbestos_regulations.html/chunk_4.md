##  How to deal with asbestos

If you think that a material may contain asbestos, or if you are arranging to
have building work done on your home, you should get advice from a specialist
asbestos monitoring/surveying company. This will help you identify whether
asbestos is present and decide what to do next. You should never handle,
disturb or remove asbestos-containing materials (ACMs) yourself.

Asbestos does not always have to be removed and disposed of. If the asbestos
is in good condition and there is no disturbance or damage to it, it wonâ€™t
cause any harm as the fibres will not be released. Sometimes, it can be safer
to maintain it rather than disturbing the asbestos by removing it. This
decision should be based on a risk assessment, carried out by a specialist.

If asbestos is to be repaired and maintained, this must be done safely and by
a specialist. Any remaining material should be clearly labelled for asbestos
and its location should be clearly marked on the plans of the building for
future reference.

Removing asbestos is a complex procedure and must only be done by a specialist
contractor. Asbestos waste is hazardous and improper removal will increase the
risk of fibre inhalation. There are detailed rules about how the waste should
be wrapped, labelled, and disposed of.
