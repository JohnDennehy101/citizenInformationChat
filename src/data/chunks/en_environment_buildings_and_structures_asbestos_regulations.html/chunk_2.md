##  What is asbestos?

Asbestos is a name given to many different naturally occurring minerals, made
up of long thin fibres, which can be dangerous if they are inhaled as dust.

Until 1999, asbestos was commonly used in building materials, mainly for
insulation and fireproofing, and in some consumer goods. However, it is now [
illegal to place asbestos or asbestos-containing products on the market
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2003/en/si/0220.html) .

So, for example, if you are having a roof removed by specialists that contains
asbestos, the material must be disposed of and cannot be re-used in any way.
