##  Prohibition notices of dangerous work

A prohibition notice is a legal order to stop specific work because of the
high level of perceived danger it is causing. If you don’t take action and
don’t meet the requirements outlined in a prohibition notice, the HSA can
prosecute you in court.

If you are convicted of an offence under the Asbestos Regulations, the court
can fine you. The court can also order you to take the necessary steps to fix
the situation within a specific deadline. It is an offence if you don’t follow
these steps.

Local authorities are responsible for investigating incidents of air and water
pollution, which includes incorrect disposal of asbestos. They can prosecute
infringements of the [ Air Pollution Act 1987
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1987/en/act/pub/0006/index.html) and the [
Local Government (Water Pollution) Act 1977
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1977/en/act/pub/0001/index.html) . Anyone who
is found to be in breach of this legislation is guilty of an offence.
