##  Where is asbestos found?

Asbestos can be found in any old building which was built or refurbished
before 2000. It was commonly used as a means of insulating and fireproofing,
but it was also used in a variety of different formats. As a result, it can be
found in building materials used for:

  * Flooring 
  * Walls 
  * Ceilings 
  * Roofs 
  * Heating systems and equipment 

**What happens if I am exposed to asbestos?**

Being exposed to asbestos can cause different health issues. Many of these can
take between 15-60 years to develop. These include an increased risk of:

  * Lung cancer 
  * Asbestosis (scarring of the lung tissue) 
  * Mesothelioma (cancer of the lining of the chest and the lining of the abdominal cavity) 
  * Pleural plagues/effusions
