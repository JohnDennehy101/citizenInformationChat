##  Introduction

Here we explain the process of administering a deceased person's estate in
Ireland, including:

  * Executors and administrators 
  * Probate 
  * Transferring land 
  * Tax 
  * Beneficiaries abroad 
  * Debts 

Our page on ‘ [ What happens to the deceased’s estate? ](/en/death/the-
deceaseds-estate/what-happens-the-deceaseds-estate/) ’ has information about:

  * Rights of access to the deceased person's estate 
  * Rights of spouses or civil partners and family members 
  * What happens if the deceased person has not made a will 

If there is a will and an executor has been appointed, then the executor deals
with the estate. The executor makes sure that the spouse or civil partner is
aware of the right to a legal right share and distributes the estate in
accordance with the will and the law.

[ If there is no will ](/en/death/before-a-death/making-a-will/) , or, if
there is a will but there is no executor, an administrator is appointed -
usually the next of kin or a [ solicitor ](/en/justice/courtroom/solicitors/)
.
