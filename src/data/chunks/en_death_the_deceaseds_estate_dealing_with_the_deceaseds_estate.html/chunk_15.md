###  If the deceased was getting social welfare

If the deceased was getting a social welfare payment, you must inform the
Department of Social Protection of the death before distributing the estate.
This is to allow the Department to reclaim any overpayment of pension that may
have been made.

The Department has 3 months to decide whether or not an overpayment was made.

If you fail to do this, you may be personally responsible to repay the
overpaid amounts. You can read more about social welfare requirements in the [
Department's document on overpayment recovery.
