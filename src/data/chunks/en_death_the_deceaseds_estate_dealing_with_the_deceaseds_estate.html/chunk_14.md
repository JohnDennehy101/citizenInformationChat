##  What are the duties of executors and administrators?

You are obliged to distribute the assets as soon as possible after the death.
You may be sued by the beneficiaries if you do not distribute the estate
within a year.

You have a duty to preserve the assets of the deceased until they are
distributed and to protect the assets from devaluation. For example, you
should make sure that all assets are properly insured.

**You** **have the power to** :

  * Deal with the estate (for example, to sell it to pay debts or distribute to beneficiaries) 
  * Represent the deceased in legal actions and to settle legal actions against the deceased's estate 

**You must:**

  * Gather together and protect all the deceased's assets such as money, shares and property and find out their combined value 
  * Call in any outstanding funds due (money owing to the deceased) 
  * Pay any debts or taxes owed 
  * Pay the funeral expenses 
  * Make sure that the spouse (or civil partner) and children know about their legal right share 
  * Make sure the entitled beneficiaries or next of kin get what they are entitled to, and that ownership of property is passed on correctly
