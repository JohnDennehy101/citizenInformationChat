##  Do I need a solicitor?

If the estate is complex, it may be better to appoint a solicitor.

A solicitor can complete the forms that are needed and give you advice on:

  * The law on succession 
  * Taxes that might have to be paid by beneficiaries 
  * Debts that may have to be paid from the estate 
  * The deceased’s will and can help settle disputes 
  * Finding out what the deceased person owned 

If you decide not to use a solicitor, you can make a personal application to
administer the estate (see ‘How to make a personal application for probate or
letters of administration’ below for information on how to do this).

The Probate Office will help with the probate process part of administering
the estate. It cannot give you legal advice and you are responsible for
completing the documentation you need.

You must use a solicitor if:

  * The person entitled to get the Grant of Representation is a [ ward of court ](/en/health/legal-matters-and-health/wards-of-court/) or of unsound mind 
  * The person entitled to get the Grant of Representation is under 18 
  * There are issues concerning the validity of the will 
  * There are disputes among the next of kin about the estate 
  * The original will is lost 
  * A beneficiary of the will of more than €20,000 (apart from the spouse of the deceased) lives outside of Ireland and the potential applicant for the Grant of Representation also lives outside of Ireland 
  * The deceased person lived outside Ireland and left a will in foreign language 
  * There are other circumstances which, in the opinion of the Probate Office, need the assistance of a solicitor
