###  Capital Acquisition Tax

The executor or administrator **does not** have to deduct and pay the [
Capital Acquisitions Tax (CAT) ](/en/money-and-tax/tax/capital-taxes/capital-
acquisitions-tax/) due from the beneficiaries before passing on the proceeds
of the will to the beneficiaries. When probate has been granted, the Probate
Office sends a copy of the Revenue Affidavit to the Revenue Commissioners.

The Revenue Commissioners will then issue a Form IT38 to each beneficiary who
it understands may have a requirement to pay and file a CAT return. The
obligation to pay and file a return rests with the beneficiary. See [
Revenue's Guide to completing the IT38 return
](https://www.revenue.ie/en/gains-gifts-and-inheritance/completing-gift-or-
inheritance-tax-return-it38/index.aspx) .
