##  Introduction

When a witness is giving evidence in court they cannot use what someone else
has said as evidence. This is called hearsay. The court must hear from the
person themselves to consider it as evidence. For example, if you are a
witness in a trial, you cannot give the following evidence, "My mother told me
she saw the accused at 3pm". This is evidence of a statement made out of court
and is hearsay. For that evidence to be introduced, your mother would have to
take the stand and describe what she saw herself.
