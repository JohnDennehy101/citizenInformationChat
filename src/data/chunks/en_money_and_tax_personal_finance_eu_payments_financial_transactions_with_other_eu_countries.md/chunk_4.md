##  SEPA (Single Euro Payments Area)

The Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA) makes all electronic payments across the
euro area as easy as electronic payments within one country. SEPA includes 36
countries â€“ the 27 EU member states (including countries which do not use the
euro) plus the UK, Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Switzerland, San Marino,
Andorra, Monaco and the Vatican City State.

SEPA allows you to:

  * Use your debit card anywhere in the euro area 
  * Make cross-border bank transfers securely, quickly and in full 
  * Set up direct debits from anywhere in the euro area 
  * Need only one bank account for the whole euro area 

You cannot be obliged by a payer or payee to maintain a bank account in any
particular country to make or receive payments. For example, an Irish person
working in France could have their French employer pay their salary directly
to their Irish account and use that account to pay direct debits and bills in
France.

You have to use the BIC (Bank Identifier Code) and IBAN (International Bank
Account Number) to identify your bank and account rather than the NSC
(National Sort Code) and Account Number.

The Payment Services Directive (which was transposed into Irish law as the [
European Communities (Payment Services) Regulations 2009
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2009/en/si/0383.html) ) provides the legal
framework for SEPA.
