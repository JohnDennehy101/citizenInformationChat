##  Where to apply

If you believe that your bank is not charging you the same amount for national
and cross-border payments you should contact them (preferably in writing) and
ask for clarification and resolution of your problem.

If you believe that the rules of the Regulation on cross-border payments have
not been followed, you can contact the [ Central Bank in Ireland
](https://www.centralbank.ie/) .

For issues between consumers and traders, contact the [ Competition and
Consumer Protection Commission ](https://www.ccpc.ie/consumers/) (CCPC).

Alternatively, if your problem appears to be a bank error rather than the
incorrect application of the Regulation rules, you may contact the [ Financial
Services and Pensions Ombudsman in Ireland ](/en/consumer/how-to-
complain/complain-about-financial-services/) .

If the problem occurred in another country, you can get help with [ redress in
other EU countries ](https://ec.europa.eu/info/about-european-
commission/contact/problems-and-complaints/complaints-about-breaches-eu-
law/how-make-complaint-national-level-0_en) .
