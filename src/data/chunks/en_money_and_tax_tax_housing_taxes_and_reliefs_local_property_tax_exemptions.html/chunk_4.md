####  Property the owner does not live in because of illness or disability

If you have not lived in your home for at least 12 months because of long-term
mental or physical illness or disability, it may be exempt from LPT.

If it is less than 12 months that you have not lived there, the property may
be exempt if your doctor confirms that you are unlikely to return to the
property.

Up to 2021, the exemption only applied if the property was not occupied by
another person. From 2022, the exemption applies if someone lives in the
property and they are not a joint owner of the property. For example, they may
be a tenant, relative or friend.
