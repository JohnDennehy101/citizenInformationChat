##  Introduction

Your property is liable for [ Local Property Tax (LPT) ](/en/money-and-
tax/tax/housing-taxes-and-reliefs/local-property-tax/) if it is a residential
property on 1 November.

Certain properties are exempt from LPT.

If your property is not exempt, you may be able to [ defer payment of the tax
](/en/money-and-tax/tax/housing-taxes-and-reliefs/deferring-local-property-
tax/) .

Some [ properties that were previously exempt up to 2021
](https://www.revenue.ie/en/property/local-property-tax/lpt-for-2013/lpt-
exemptions-2013-2021.aspx) have been liable to LPT since 2022, including
properties built since 2013.

If your property is exempt, you still have to [ assess the value of your
property ](/en/money-and-tax/tax/housing-taxes-and-reliefs/valuing-property-
for-lpt/) and [ make a Local Property Tax return
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/money-and-tax/tax/housing-taxes-and-
reliefs/local-property-tax/%235a2b43) .
