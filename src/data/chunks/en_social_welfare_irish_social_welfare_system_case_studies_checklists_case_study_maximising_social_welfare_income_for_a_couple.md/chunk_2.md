**(2024 rates)**

Mary is working and earning €224 a week. Her days at work have been reduced
permanently to 3 days. She has an entitlement to [ Jobseeker’s Benefit (JB)
](/en/social-welfare/unemployed-people/jobseekers-benefit/) . As her days at
work are permanently reduced, she will be assessed for JB as a part-time
worker and not a systematic short-time worker.

John has been out of work for some time and his JB claim has come to an end.
He has applied for Jobseeker’s Allowance (JA). He has been offered a part-time
job and will be working 2 days and earning €100 each week.

John and Mary have 2 children aged 7 and 12. They have no assessable means
other than that from employment.

What social welfare payments can John and Mary claim and which payments will
maximise their household income?
