###  Assessment 2: Mary claims JB for the family

Personal rate €232

IQA €154 (not reduced as John’s earnings are only €100)

IQC €100 (IQC for 2 children - one child under 12 and one child 12 or over)

Total JB €486

However, because Mary is working part-time 3 days each week, she is only
eligible to claim for JB for 2 days. She will get two-fifths (40%) of €486.

**Mary’s JB payment is €194.40 payment** for 3 days of unemployment.

Total income for Assessment 2:  Add their sources of income together to find
their total income:  Mary’s JB + Mary’s income from work + John’s income from
work = total income  €194.40 + €224 + €100 = €518.40  **Total income =
€518.40**
