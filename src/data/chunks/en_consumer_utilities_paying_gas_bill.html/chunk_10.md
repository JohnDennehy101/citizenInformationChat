##  Getting a meter reading

Your gas meter measures the amount of gas you use. The readings are used by
your supplier to calculate your bill.

A GNI meter reader will call to your property to record the amount of gas used
since the meter was last read. This is done 4 times a year. An estimated
reading will be used for the other billing periods.

When new meters are installed, they are located in external meter boxes. For
older homes, the meter may be inside the home. If the meter reader cannot
access the meter, they will leave a card in the mailbox letting you know they
were there and asking you to submit your reading. You can also submit your
meter reading directly to your supplier. If you do not submit a reading an
estimated reading will be used to calculate your next bill.

Meters are the property of Gas Networks Ireland and must not be interfered
with in any way. Interference with a meter is against the law and offenders
can be prosecuted.
