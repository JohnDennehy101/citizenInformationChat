##  Understanding your bill

It can sometimes be difficult to understand the bill, particularly how the
amount you owe is calculated.

You should receive a bill from your gas supplier every 2 months. It must be
clearly marked whether the meter read used to calculate your bill amount was:

  * A – an actual meter read by GNI 
  * C – a read submitted by you the customer 
  * E – an estimated meter reading 

Check your bill to make sure that you are not getting too many estimated bills
in a row as this could result in a large bill when an actual reading is taken.
You can check your meter and submit your own reading at any time to ensure
accurate billing. GNI has information on [ how to submit a meter reading
](https://www.gasnetworks.ie/home/gas-meter/submit-meter-reading/) .
