##  Right to banded hours

If your employment contract does not state the average hours per week that you
actually work over 12 months, you are entitled to a banded contract.

There are 8 bands covering a certain number of hours a week (for example, 6 to
11 hours or 11 to 16 hours a week).

Once you are placed on a particular band, you have the right to work an
average of those hours for 12 months.

You can find more information about [ the working week
](/en/employment/employment-rights-and-conditions/hours-of-work/working-
hours/) , including how to ask for a banded hours contract and how to complain
if your request was unreasonably refused.
