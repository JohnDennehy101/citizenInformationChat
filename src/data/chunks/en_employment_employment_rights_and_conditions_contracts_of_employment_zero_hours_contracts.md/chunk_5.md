###  **Banded hours**

Where your current employment contract does not accurately reflect the average
hours per week that you actually work over a 12-month period, you are entitled
to a banded contract.

A banded contract gives you the right to work an average of the hours in your
specified band for 12 months. There are 8 bands covering a certain number of
hours per week (for example, 6-11 or 11-16 hours per week).

You can find more information in our document on [ the working week
](/en/employment/employment-rights-and-conditions/hours-of-work/working-
hours/) on how to request a banded hours contract and how to complain if you
feel your request was unreasonably refused.
