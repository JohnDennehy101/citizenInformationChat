###  Calculating the minimum payment

€11.30 per hour is the [ national minimum wage ](/en/employment/employment-
rights-and-conditions/pay-and-employment/minimum-wage/) . Alternatively, you
could substitute the ERO hourly rate if this applies to your job.

**Example 1:** You got no work (€11.30 x 3 times x 5 hours) = €169.50

**Example 2:** You got 3 hours’ work(€11.30 x 3 times x 2 hours) = €67.80

This minimum payment rate does not apply if you are on call.

The rules on how to calculate these minimum payments are set out in the [
Employment (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2018
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2018/act/38/enacted/en/print.html) .
