##  What are zero-hours contracts?

A zero-hours contract is where you are available for work but your hours of
work are not specified under your [ employment contract
](/en/employment/employment-rights-and-conditions/contracts-of-
employment/contract-of-employment/) .

A zero-hours contract requires you to be available for a certain number of
hours a week, or when required, or both. You are not guaranteed a set number
of hours.

Employees on zero-hours contracts are protected by the [ Organisation of
Working Time Act 1997
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1997/en/act/pub/0020/index.html) . However,
this does not apply to casual work.

The laws on zero-hours contracts are set out in the [ Employment
(Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2018
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2018/act/38/enacted/en/print.html) . This
Act strengthens your employment rights in several areas, including banning
zero-hours contracts in most cases.
