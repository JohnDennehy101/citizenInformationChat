##  The court hearing

On the day of your court hearing, you will have to attend the District Court.
This will be open to the public and it will be a District Court [ judge
](/en/justice/courtroom/judge/) that will hear your case.

When your case is called, you will hear your name called out and then the name
of the respondent. At this point, you should stand up and identify yourself to
the court.

The Small Claims Registrar will call out a summary of your case to the judge.
You will be asked to go to the witness box to swear an oath to tell the truth.
The Court Clerk will assist you with this process.
