###  **Step 3: Submit your FCA1 form to the Garda√≠**

Send your completed form to your [ local garda station
](https://www.garda.ie/en/contact-us/station-directory/) , and a chief
superintendent or a superintendent will decide on your application.

If you are seeking a certificate for a restricted firearm, you must send the
application form to a chief superintendent nominated by the Garda
Commissioner. You must include a reason why a non-restricted firearm would not
serve your purpose for a firearm.

If your firearm certificate is granted, you may have to meet certain
conditions. This can include the amount of ammunition you can hold at any one
time or whether the firearm can be loaded when you transport it.

You then have to pay a fee to issue your firearm certificate. Your grant
notice letter will outline the fee.
