##  Introduction

You must choose a private company in your area for the collection and disposal
of your household rubbish bins.

Waste is collected by these private companies every week or two, depending on
the type of waste. Some companies collect different types of rubbish on
different days.

If you live in a rural area with a low population, you may not have a
collection service. In this case, you must bring your domestic waste to an
approved waste facility in your area.
