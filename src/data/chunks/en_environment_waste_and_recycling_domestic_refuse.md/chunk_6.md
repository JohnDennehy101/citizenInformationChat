###  **Waste bags and tags**

If you do not have wheelie bins, your waste company may use specific bin bags
or bin tags that you can buy. If they use tags, you must attach a pre-paid tag
to each bag. If you do not use the specific bag or add a tag to your bin bag,
your waste will not be collected. Your waste collector will tell you where to
buy the bags or tags.
