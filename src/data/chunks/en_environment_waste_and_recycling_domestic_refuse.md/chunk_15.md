##  What should I do with bulky waste?

You cannot leave bulky items such as carpets, furniture or fridges out for the
regular bin collection.

If you have a lot of rubbish to get rid of, you can hire a skip from a private
waste collection company.

You can also bring bulky waste to civic amenity centres or [ landfill sites
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/environment/waste-and-
recycling/landfill-sites/) .

Your local authority may offer bulk waste collections and will advertise this
service when it happens.

Find information on disposing of [ waste from electrical and electronic
equipment (WEEE) ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/environment/waste-
and-recycling/waste-from-electric-and-electronic-equipment/) .
