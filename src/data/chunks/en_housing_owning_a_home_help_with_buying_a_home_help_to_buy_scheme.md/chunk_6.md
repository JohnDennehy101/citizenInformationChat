###  About your mortgage

To qualify, you must [ take out a mortgage ](/en/housing/owning-a-home/help-
with-buying-a-home/taking-out-a-mortgage/) with a qualifying lender. The
mortgage must be at least 70% of:

  * The purchase value of the property if you are buying a newly built home. The purchase value is normally the price you pay for the property. However, if the purchase price is less than the market value, the purchase value will be the market value. 
  * The valuation approved by the mortgage provider, if you are building your home. The approved valuation is the valuation of the property at the time you take out the mortgage. 

This is known as the _loan to value ratio_ .

You are allowed to have a guarantor on the loan. A guarantor is someone who
agrees to have the responsibility to pay your mortgage if you don't or can't
pay it. For example, your guarantor could be a parent or close relative. If
you have a guarantor on the loan, they do not have to be a first-time buyer.
