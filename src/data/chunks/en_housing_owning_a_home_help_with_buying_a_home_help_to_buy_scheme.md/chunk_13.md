##  Can Revenue ask me to repay the Help to Buy payment?

You will have to repay Revenue some or all of your Help to Buy payment in
certain situations. This is called clawback.

You have to pay the HTB payment back to Revenue if you:

  * Do not live in the home for at least 5 years 
  * Do not complete the purchase of the home 
  * Do not finish building the home 
  * Were not entitled to the payment in the first place 

If you do not live in the home for 5 years, the amount you must repay depends
on how long you lived there.

This table shows how much you have to repay depending on how long you lived in
the home.

HTB applies to houses and apartments, so better to say home to cover this.

**Number of years** **** **living in the home** |  **% of clawback**  
---|---  
1  |  100%   
2  |  80%   
3  |  60%   
4  |  40%   
5  |  20%   
  
There are some exceptions to this. For example, if you bought or built the
home with another first-time buyer and you want to move out, but they want to
stay for at least 5 years, you will not have to repay the HTB.

There is also an exception if you need to relocate temporarily for work. Find
out more about this in Revenueâ€™s [ Help to Buy guidance (pdf)

**Can Revenue ask my contractor to repay the Help to Buy payment?**

Your qualifying contractor will have to repay the HTB payment if:

  * You have not bought the home within 2 years of the contractor getting the HTB payment 
  * Revenue thinks you will not purchase the home within 2 years of the contractor getting the HTB payment 

In certain cases, Revenue will be flexible about this. For example, if the
home is almost finished after 2 years and is likely to be completed shortly.
