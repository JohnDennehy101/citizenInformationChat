###  Original Help to Buy Scheme

If you signed a contract for a new house, or drew down on a self-build
mortgage between **1 January 2017** and **22 July 2020** , you qualify for the
original relief.

You can claim relief on **the lesser of** :

  * €20,000 
  * 5% of the market value of a new build property 
  * 5% of the approved valuation of a self-build property 
  * The amount of income tax and DIRT you paid in the 4 years before the year you apply 

The maximum payment is €20,000 per qualifying property under the original
scheme. This cap applies regardless of how many people are involved in buying
the property.
