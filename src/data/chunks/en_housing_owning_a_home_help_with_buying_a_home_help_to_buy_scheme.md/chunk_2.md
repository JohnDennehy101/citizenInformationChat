##  What is the Help to Buy Scheme?

The Help to Buy (HTB) Scheme helps first-time buyers purchase a newly-built
house or apartment. You can also get it for once-off self-build homes. It only
applies to properties that cost â‚¬500,000 or less.

The Help to Buy Scheme gives a refund of the [ income tax ](/en/money-and-
tax/tax/) and [ Deposit Interest Retention Tax (DIRT) ](/en/money-and-
tax/tax/tax-on-savings-and-investments/deposit-interest-retention-tax/) you
have paid in Ireland for the 4 years before the year you apply.

The HTB Scheme was increased in July 2020. This increase is known as the
Enhanced Help to Buy Scheme. The Enhanced Help to Buy Scheme is available
until 31 December 2024.
