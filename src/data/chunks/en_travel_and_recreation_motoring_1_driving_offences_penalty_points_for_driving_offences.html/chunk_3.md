##  How do penalty points work?

Penalty points are recorded on your driving licence when:

  * You are convicted in court of a driving offence that attracts penalty points or 
  * You pay a [ fixed charge notice ](/en/travel-and-recreation/motoring/driving-offences/driving-offences/) that was issued to you for an offence that also carries penalty points 

If you get 12 penalty points in any 3 year period, you are automatically
disqualified from driving for 6 months.

**Learner permit** drivers are disqualified if they have 7 penalty points.
This lower threshold also applies for the first 2 years of a driverâ€™s first
full driving licence.

Penalty points are not added to your licence immediately.
