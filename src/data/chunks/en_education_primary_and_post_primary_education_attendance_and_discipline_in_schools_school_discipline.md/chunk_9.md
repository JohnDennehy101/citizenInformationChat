###  Appeal hearing

You will be asked to attend an appeal hearing. You can bring 2 other people
with you. However, they cannot make a statement at the hearing unless the
appeals committee allows them to do so.

If the student is aged over 18, he or she can attend the hearing.

The hearing is normally held within 21 days of the Department getting your
completed Section 29 appeal form.

At the hearing, your appeal will be heard by an appeals committee of 3 people.
You and the school can present your case and have a right of reply. Members of
the appeal committee may ask you questions.

The appeals committee may invite people with relevant expertise to attend or
make a statement such as Tusla or the [ National Council of Special Education
](https://ncse.ie/) .

The committee is appointed by the Minister of Education, but independent of
the Department. In making its decision, the appeal committee must consider
factors such as the:

  * Nature of the behaviour 
  * Explanation offered 
  * Efforts made by the school to help the student 
  * Educational interests of your child 
  * Effect on other students. 

They will also consider any safety, health and welfare issues for students and
staff.

**Outcome of your appeal**

After the hearing, the appeals committee will write to you and the other
participants with their preliminary decision and the reasons for their
decision.

You and the other participants have an opportunity to respond in writing
within 7 days of the preliminary decision being issued.

The appeals committee will then make its final decision. You will be sent a
copy of the final decision and the reasons for the decision.
