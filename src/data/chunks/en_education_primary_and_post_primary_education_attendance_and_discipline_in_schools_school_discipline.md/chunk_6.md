##  What happens if my child is suspended from school?

If there has been serious misbehaviour, the school’s board of management or
the school principal may decide to suspend your child. The process for
suspension should be set out in the school’s code of behaviour.

The school will notify the parents of the suspension. If your child is
suspended they will keep their place in the school. This means that they can
return to the school at the end of their suspension.

A child should not be suspended for more than 3 days at a time, except in
exceptional circumstances.

If your child is suspended from school for 20 days or more in a school year,
you have the right to appeal this decision to the Department of Education. You
must appeal within 42 days of the decision to suspend your child – see ‘How to
appeal a suspension or expulsion from school’ below.
