##  Discipline in schools

Schools have considerable independence in the area of discipline. However,
they must use fair procedures. This includes hearing the student's case.

It is assumed that parents agree to the punishments set out in the code of
behaviour, if they are told about the code when their child starts school. As
a result, if the punishment is detention, the parents or student cannot claim
that the student has been falsely imprisoned.
