##  Introduction

If you have left school without any formal qualifications, the [ Youthreach
programme ](https://www.gov.ie/en/service/5666e9-youthreach/) can provide you
with opportunities for basic education, personal development, vocational
training and work experience.

The programme is generally full-time, although part-time courses can be
arranged. You can concentrate on a core training area of your choice but basic
subjects, such as English, maths and life skills, are generally covered by all
trainees.

Opportunities to improve literacy and numeracy are available at all Youthreach
centres.
