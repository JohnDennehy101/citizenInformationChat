#  Tribunals and investigations

  * [ Public inquiries in Ireland ](/en/government-in-ireland/how-government-works/tribunals-and-investigations/tribunals-introduction/)

Irish law makes provision for a number of different types of investigatory
inquiry.

  * [ Tribunals of inquiry ](/en/government-in-ireland/how-government-works/tribunals-and-investigations/tribunals-of-inquiry/)

A tribunal of inquiry investigates a specific matter(s) of public importance
and submits a report to the Oireachtas setting out its findings of fact.

Commissions of investigation are a less expensive and speedier method of
investigating matters than a tribunal of inquiry.
