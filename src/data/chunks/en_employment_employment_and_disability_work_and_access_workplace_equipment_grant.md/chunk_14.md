###  **Buying the equipment**

Once your application for the Workplace Equipment Grant is approved, you can
begin purchasing the necessary equipment or technology.

  * The approved equipment or technology must be sourced and purchased by your employer or a designated representative. They will be responsible for buying the specific items that have been approved for funding. 
  * Your employer can claim reimbursement for the costs up to the amount approved in your grant. In some cases, arrangements can be made for direct payment to the equipment provider. 
  * If the equipment requires specialist training for its use, the costs for this training can also be covered by the grant.
