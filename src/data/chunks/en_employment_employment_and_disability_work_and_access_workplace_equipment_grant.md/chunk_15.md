###  **Ownership of the equipment**

The person with the disability who benefits from the equipment keeps ownership
of it. This means the equipment is yours to keep and use, even if you change
jobs or work environments unless it has been integrated into your employerâ€™s
general equipment.

While you own the equipment, your employer may be responsible for its
insurance, maintenance, and any necessary health and safety training related
to its use while you are employed with them.
