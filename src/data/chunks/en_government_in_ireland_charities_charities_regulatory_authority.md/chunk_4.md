##  Investigations

The Regulator can appoint an inspector to investigate a charity. The charity
and its trustees must fully co-operate with an investigation and give the
inspector all the relevant accounts and documents.

The inspector has the power to make people co-operate with an investigation,
including people not directly connected with the charity. The inspector can
also apply to the District Court for a warrant to enter and search a charityâ€™s
premises.

Investigators report their findings to the Charities Regulator. The Regulator
may forward the report to other authorities such as the Director of Public
Prosecutions or the Revenue Commissioners, for further investigation. The High
Court will decide whether the charity has violated the Charities Act.
