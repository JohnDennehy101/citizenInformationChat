##  What is notification of marriage?

Anyone planning to get married in Ireland must give a minimum of 3 monthsâ€™
notice to the Registrar at a [ Civil Registration Service
](https://www2.hse.ie/services/births-deaths-and-marriages/contact-a-civil-
registration-service.html) . This is the law in Ireland and it applies to all
civil, religious and secular marriages. This is sometimes referred to as
_notification of your intention to marry_ .

If everything is in order, the Registrar will give you a Marriage Registration
Form (MRF). The MRF is like a marriage licence. It gives you authorisation or
permission to get married.
