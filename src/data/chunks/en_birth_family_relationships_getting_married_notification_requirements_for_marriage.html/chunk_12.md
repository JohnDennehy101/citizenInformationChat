###  Civil partners

If your civil partnership ceremony took place in the State and you now wish to
marry your civil partner, you must, by appointment, attend the Registrar at
least 5 days (or as determined by the Registrar) before the intended date of
the ceremony to sign a declaration in their presence that there is no
impediment to the marriage.

If your civil partnership ceremony took place abroad you will be required to
give the Registrar 3 monthsâ€™ notice of your intention to marry and complete
the standard preliminaries for a valid marriage.
