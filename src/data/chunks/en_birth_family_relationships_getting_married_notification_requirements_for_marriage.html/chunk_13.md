###  Postal notification if you are not able to attend in person

If either of you are living abroad or are unable to attend a civil
registration office due to serious illness, you should contact a Registrar to
get permission to make your 3-month notification by post. If permission is
granted, the Registrar will send you a form which you must complete and
return.

You will still have to make arrangements to meet the Registrar at least 5 days
before you get married in order sign the declaration form. This is required
before a Marriage Registration Form can be issued.
