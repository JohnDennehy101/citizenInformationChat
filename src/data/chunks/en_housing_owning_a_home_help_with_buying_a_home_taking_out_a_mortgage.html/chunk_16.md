###  Assessment by the lender

In addition to the Central Bankâ€™s lending limits, its [ Consumer Protection
Code 2012 ](https://www.centralbank.ie/regulation/consumer-
protection/consumer-protection-codes-regulations) requires all regulated
lenders to assess your personal circumstances and financial situation
thoroughly before agreeing to offer you a mortgage.

The lender must carry out detailed assessments of the affordability of the
product being offered and of its suitability for you. When offering you a
mortgage, the lender must give you a written statement, setting out the
reasons why the mortgage product being offered is considered suitable for your
needs, objectives and circumstances.

The [ European Union (Consumer Mortgage Credit Agreements) Regulations 2016
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2016/si/142/made/en/print) also require
lenders to conduct a creditworthiness assessment prior to offering a mortgage
loan.
