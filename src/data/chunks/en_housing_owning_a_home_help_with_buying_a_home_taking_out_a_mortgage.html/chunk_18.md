###  Problems paying the mortgage

If you are having difficulty managing your finances, there are several things
you can do. The [ Money Advice and Budgeting Service (MABS) ](/en/money-and-
tax/personal-finance/debt/mabs-service/) can help you to review your income
and your outgoings, make out a budget and deal with your debts in general.

Even if you have not yet missed a mortgage payment, you are protected by the
Central Bankâ€™s [ Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears ](/en/housing/owning-a-
home/mortgage-arrears/consumer-protection-codes-and-mortgages/) if you contact
your lender and let them know that you are having a problem.

To discuss these and other options, you can call the MABS Helpline at 0818 07
2000 (9am - 8pm, Monday - Friday) or email [ helpline@mabs.ie
](mailto:helpline@mabs.ie) .

If you find yourself in serious mortgage arrears, you can contact [ Abhaile
](/en/housing/owning-a-home/mortgage-arrears/abhaile-mortgage-arrears-
support/) for free mortgage arrears support.
