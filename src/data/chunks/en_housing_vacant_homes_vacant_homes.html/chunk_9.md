###  **Vacant Property Refurbishment Grant**

The [ Vacant Property Refurbishment Grant ](/en/housing/housing-grants-and-
schemes/local-authority-housing-grants-and-supports/vacant-property-
refurbishment-grant/) provides funding so you can refurbish vacant and
derelict homes. It can also be used to renovate properties that have not been
used as residential properties before.

You can get the grant if you are refurbishing the vacant or derelict property
so you can live there, or so you can rent the property out.
