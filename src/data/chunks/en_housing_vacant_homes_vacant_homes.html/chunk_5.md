###  **Tax on vacant properties**

A [ Vacant Homes Tax (VHT) ](/en/money-and-tax/tax/housing-taxes-and-
reliefs/vacant-homes-tax/) was introduced in 2023. It applies to properties
which can be lived in but have been stayed in for less than 30 days in the
previous 12 months.

The rate of VHT on a property is three times the [ basic rate of Local
Property Tax ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/money-and-
tax/tax/housing-taxes-and-reliefs/vacant-homes-
tax/local_property_tax.en.html#l20ad0) for the property.

The basic rate of Local Property Tax depends on the value of the property.
