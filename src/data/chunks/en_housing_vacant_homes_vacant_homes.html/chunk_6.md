###  **Compulsory purchase of vacant and derelict sites**

Some statutory bodies can take land or property without the owner's consent. A
compulsory purchase order (CPO) is the legal function they use to do this.

Compulsory purchase usually happens to allow a public infrastructure project
to go ahead for the common good. However, as part of the Governmentâ€™s Housing
for All plan, they aim to use CPOs to purchase up to 2,500 vacant properties
by 2026. These properties can then be resold to the public. This process will
be carried out by local authorities.

See our page on the [ compulsory purchase of property ](/en/housing/losing-
your-home-and-homelessness/compulsory-purchase-of-property/) for more
information on what to do if you receive a compulsory purchase order.
