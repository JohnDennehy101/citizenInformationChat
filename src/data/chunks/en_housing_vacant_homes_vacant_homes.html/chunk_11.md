###  **Buy and Renew Scheme**

The Buy and Renew Scheme helps local authorities buy and repair properties
that need to be refurbished, so they can be used for social housing.

Local authorities are responsible for deciding what properties are suitable
and may approach you if you own a vacant property.

If you agree, the local authority will buy your property from you and repair
it, so it can be used for social housing.
