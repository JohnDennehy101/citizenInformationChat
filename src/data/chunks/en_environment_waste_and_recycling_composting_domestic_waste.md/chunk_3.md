##  How do I recycle food and garden waste?

You can recycle organic waste by putting it into a brown bin, making it into
compost at home or bringing it to a civic amenity centre.

  1. **Brown bins:** Your waste collector must offer you a brown bin collection service (unless you live on an offshore island). 
  2. **Home composting:** Make a compost heap in your garden or use a compost container. Some local authorities offer compost containers for sale at reduced rates. 
  3. **Civic amenity centres:** You can also bring organic waste to many civic amenity centres to be composted. [ Find your civic amenity centre on this map ](https://www.mywaste.ie/where-can-you-dispose-of-your-waste/) and check if it accepts food and garden waste.
