##  What is home composting?

You can recycle organic material such as food scraps and garden waste yourself
by composting in your garden. Microorganisms, including bacteria and fungi
feed on organic waste and break it down into a dark crumbly mass called
compost. Compost is rich in plant nutrients, and you can dig it into soil to
improve your garden.

**You can compost** cooked or uncooked fruit and vegetable waste, coffee, tea,
garden waste, eggshells, kitchen paper, light cardboard (for example, egg and
cereal boxes) [ as well as other items
