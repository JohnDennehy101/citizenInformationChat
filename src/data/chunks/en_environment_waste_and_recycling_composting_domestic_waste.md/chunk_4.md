##  Brown bin collection

Bin collection services provide households with a brown bin to collect and
recycle many types of organic waste. Your brown bin waste is sent for
composting or anaerobic digestion within Ireland. Anaerobic digestion is when
food and garden waste is turned into bio-gas, which can generate electricity.

[ Since 1 January 2024, ](https://www.gov.ie/en/press-release/ccc12-brown-
bins-to-be-rolled-out-to-all-households-in-ireland/) your bin collection
company must give you a brown bin and arrange to collect your brown bin. This
applies to all households in Ireland, except households on offshore islands.

A period of time has been given to bin collection companies to arrange for the
extension of their brown bin service to more households. Until then, you can
contact your current waste collector and let them know you want a brown bin
collection service. Check [ what waste providers are available in your local
area ](https://www.mywaste.ie/waste-management-providers/) .
