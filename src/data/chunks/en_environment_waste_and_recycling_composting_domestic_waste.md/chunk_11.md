####  Decide where to put it

  * Set the composter on grass or earth so worms can get in from below 
  * Place it not too far from the kitchen door â€“ near enough to be convenient but far enough away to avoid smells. 
  * Choose a sunny spot as warmth will speed up the composting process. 
  * Raise it 1cm to 2 cm off the ground by putting a few flat stones under the base. This will stop the holes becoming blocked.
