###  **Do I have to use a brown bin?**

You must separate your food and garden waste from other recycling waste and
from general or landfill rubbish. Instead of a brown bin, you can use your
food and garden waste to make compost at home or bring it to a civic amenity
service.

Your bin collection company must keep a record of customers who don't use
their brown bin collection; your local authority can access this. If you
choose not to have your organic waste collected, you will have to write to
your bin collector with details of how you manage your food waste. This page
will be updated as more details become available.
