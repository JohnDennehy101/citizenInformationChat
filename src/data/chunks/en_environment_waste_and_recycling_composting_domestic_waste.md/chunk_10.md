####  Prepare your equipment

  * Get a garden shovel or fork for turning and removing the compost. 
  * Check [ what composting system you should use (pdf) ](https://compostingireland.ie/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/One-for-me.pdf) . 
  * If you are choosing a container, choose a size for your household. If you choose a composter with a base, it should have holes in it to allow worms to go in and moisture to drain out.
