###  **How regular is the brown bin collection?**

If you ask for a brown bin collection, your bin collection company must
collect your garden waste collection at least monthly from 1 March to 31
October each year. The bin collection company will be able to advise you of
the schedule for food waste collection as well. Your brown bin collection
service must also make you aware of its availability.

Your bin collection company will have more information on what to put in your
brown bin, when it is collected and how much collection costs. Check [ what
waste providers are available in your local area
