##  What is social work?

Social work aims to help you make decisions which will improve your quality of
life.

**What is a social worker?**

A social worker is somebody trained to review all your needs. Your social
worker’s job is to help empower you, by focusing on your strengths, abilities,
natural coping strategies, and your family. They may advocate for you (speak
up for you) and refer you to other services if needed.

They will work with you and your family to reduce the effects of isolation,
relationship difficulties, low income, and lack of housing.

**How can a social worker help me?**

Social workers can help you with:

  * Getting the most appropriate community service for you 
  * Housing or residential care for you and your family 
  * Complex welfare rights or legal issues 
  * Family support services if you are in crisis or difficulty 

**Social workers in public hospitals**

If you are leaving a public hospital, there are social workers to help if you
need it. The social worker may find suitable accommodation for you, help you
to find a place in a [ nursing home
