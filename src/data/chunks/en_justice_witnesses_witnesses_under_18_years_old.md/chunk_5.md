###  The Director of Public Prosecutions

The Garda√≠ inform the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP)
about the case. They also inform the DPP about how the child or young person
feels about giving evidence in court, and how their parents, guardians or
carers feel about this.

The DPP makes an independent decision about whether to proceed with the
prosecution, which means that the child or young person may or may not need to
give evidence.
