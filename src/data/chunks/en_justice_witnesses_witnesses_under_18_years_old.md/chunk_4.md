###  The Gardaí

A complaint is made to the Gardaí that identifies the child or young person as
a victim of, or witness to, a crime. A Garda officer then interviews the child
or young person.

Witnesses who are under 18 years of age can make statements during an
interview with a Garda or another competent person. A competent person in this
situation could be a professional who assesses the young person because of an
abuse case that is being investigated.

The Gardaí consider the allegations and can decide to:

  * Interview the accused about what the child or young person has said and send the file to the Director of Public Prosecutions, or 
  * Arrest the accused on warrant, or 
  * Charge the accused with an offence or 
  * Issue a summons for the accused to appear in court.
