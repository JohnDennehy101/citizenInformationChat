###  The court

Criminal cases begin in the [ District Court ](/en/justice/courts-
system/district-court/) where the judge sits without a jury. Cases involving
minor offences are decided in the District Court. Cases involving more serious
offences are sent to the [ Circuit Court ](/en/justice/courts-system/circuit-
court/) . Cases involving murder, rape, aggravated sexual assault, treason and
piracy must be heard in the [ Central Criminal Court ](/en/justice/courts-
system/high-court/) . In the Circuit and Central Criminal Courts, there is a
judge and a jury.

If you are 14 years of age or older when you give evidence you will have to
take an oath or affirmation. This means that you promise to tell the truth by
repeating certain words. The clerk or register will tell you what you have to
say.

If you are under 14 years of age the judge may decide that you do not have to
take the oath. You must still tell the truth, and it will be an offence if you
do not do so.

In some cases involving sexual offences, the judge can decide not to let
members of the public into the court.

It is important that your evidence be in your own words. No one should tell
you what to say or help you practice giving your evidence before you go to
court. The case may fail if it appears that you have been "coached". The
prosecution can give you more advice on this.
