###  Schools' responsibilities

Schools must keep a register of the students attending the school. They must
also maintain attendance records for all students and inform the Child and
Family Agency's educational welfare services if a child is absent for more
than 20 days in a school year.

The principal must also inform the Child and Family Agency's educational
welfare services if, they think a student has an attendance problem. This may
be because the student is not coming to school or has been suspended. You can
find more information about [ school discipline ](/en/education/primary-and-
post-primary-education/attendance-and-discipline-in-schools/school-
discipline/) . Schools can make [ attendance returns to Tusla online

schools-inc-absence-reporting/reporting-absenteeism/guide-to-submitting-
school-absence-returns-online/) .

**School Attendance Strategy**

The Board of Management in each school must prepare a school attendance
strategy and send it to the Agency.

This strategy encourages regular school attendance and an appreciation of
learning within the school. The strategy may:

  * Reward students who have good attendance records 
  * Identify students who are at risk of dropping out early 
  * Establish closer contacts between the school and the families concerned 
  * Co-ordinate programmes with other schools aimed at promoting good behaviour and encouraging attendance 
  * Identify aspects of the operation and management of the school and the curriculum that may contribute to student absence and remove these if they are not necessary for the running of the school. 

**Enforcement**

The Child and Family Agency can arrange for an examination of a child's
intellectual, emotional or physical development, with a parent's consent. If
the parent refuses consent, Tusla can apply to the [ Circuit Court
](/en/justice/courts-system/circuit-court/) for an order that the examination
be carried out. The Circuit Court can grant the order if it is satisfied that
the child's behaviour, lack of educational progress or regular absence from
school without a reasonable excuse warrants an examination.
