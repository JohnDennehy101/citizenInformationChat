###  Obligation to attend school

Parents do not have to send their children to a recognised school if:

  * The child is on the register (described above) 
  * Parents have applied to have their child included on the register but a decision has not been made or an appeal is pending 
  * The child is being educated outside the state 
  * There is a good reason for the child not attending school 

If Tusla refuses to register a child, or requires an undertaking from a parent
or removes a child from the register, you can appeal to the Minister. The
Minister will appoint an appeal committee. The committee will decide whether
to:

  * Register the child 
  * Refuse to register the child, or 
  * Require the parent to comply with any requirements Tusla considers appropriate. 

Where no appeal is brought, Tusla must make every reasonable effort to have
the child enrolled in another school. If this fails, Tusla must ensure that
the child receives a prescribed minimum education.
