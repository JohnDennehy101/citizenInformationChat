##  The Child and Family Agency

The [ Child and Family Agency (Tusla)
](http://www.tusla.ie/services/educational-welfare-services/) is responsible
for ensuring that every child attends school regularly, or otherwise receives
an appropriate minimum education. It also advises the Government on school
attendance and education provision. Tusla's emphasis is on helping schools,
families and children, rather than imposing penalties for non-attendance at
school. Tusla employs educational welfare officers at local level throughout
the country to provide support and advice to parents and schools and to follow
up on absences from school. They also help to co-ordinate all policies
concerning attendance and educational welfare.

Tusla also:

  * Monitors school attendance, and takes a range of measures where children do not attend school 
  * Maintains a register of children who are not attending a recognised school 
  * Maintains a register of young people aged 16 and 17 years who leave school early to take up employment and makes arrangements for their continuing education and training in consultation with providers and employers 
  * Collects data on school attendance and non-attendance, suspensions and expulsions 
  * Intervenes in relation to proposed school expulsions 

Tusla publishes [ reports on school attendance at primary and secondary
schools ](https://www.tusla.ie/services/educational-welfare-
