##  Introduction

The legislation governing school attendance in Ireland is the [ Education
(Welfare) Act 2000.
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2000/en/act/pub/0022/index.html) Under the
Act the minimum school leaving age is 16 years, or until students have
completed 3 years of second-level education, whichever is the later.

Parents must ensure that their children from the age of 6 to the age of 16
attend a recognised school or receive a certain minimum education. There is no
absolute legal obligation on children to attend school nor on their parents to
send them to school.

A _recognised school_ is a school overseen by the Department of Education. An
independent school (or non-recognised school) is one that is not overseen by
the Department of Education.

The Irish Constitution recognises the family as the primary educator of the
child. It guarantees to respect the right and duty of parents to provide
(according to their means) for the religious and moral, intellectual, physical
and social education of their children. Parents are free to provide this [
education in their homes ](/en/education/the-irish-education-system/home-
education/) or in schools recognised or established by the State.
