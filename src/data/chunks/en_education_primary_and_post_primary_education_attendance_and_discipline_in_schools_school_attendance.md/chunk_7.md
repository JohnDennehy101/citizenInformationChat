##  Parents' responsibilities and duties

Under the Education Welfare Act 2000 parents must inform the school if their
children will be absent from school on a school day and the reason for the
absence, such as illness. It is best to do this in writing. The Child and
Family Agency strongly advises against taking children out of school to go on
holiday during term-time.

Parents and guardians have a legal obligation to ensure that their child
attends a school or else receives an education. If Tusla considers that a
parent is failing in his or her obligation, it must send the parent a School
Attendance Notice. The warning outlines that legal action will follow if the
child does not attend school regularly. Tusla must make reasonable efforts to
consult with the parents and the child, before sending the warning.

If the parent fails to comply with a warning, they may be prosecuted. If
convicted, the parent may be fined and/or imprisoned for a month and also
fined for each subsequent day that they fail to send the child to school. If
the parent claims that suitable alternative education is being provided, they
must prove this. It will be a defence for the parents to show that they have
made all reasonable efforts to send the child to school - in such cases, the
Child and Family Agency must be informed.

Tusla has a leaflet for parents [ Don't let your child miss out.
