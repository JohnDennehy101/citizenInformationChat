###  Education outside the school system

The Minister can set minimum standards of education for [ children educated
outside the recognised school system ](/en/education/the-irish-education-
system/home-education/) .

The Child and Family Agency must keep a register of children who are receiving
education but not attending a recognised school. This register will show the
names of children who are educated at home or in an independent school. It is
not a register of school dropouts.

All parents or guardians who want to educate their children at home, must
register their child with Tusla. If the parent agrees, Tusla's [ Alternative
Education Assessment and Registration Service (AEARS)
](https://www.tusla.ie/services/family-community-support/alternative-
education-assessment-and-registration-service/) will assess the educational
arrangements in place for the child and determine whether you are providing a
minimum education. If Tusla is satisfied, it may enter the child's name on the
register.

If Tusla is not satisfied, it can:

  * Require the parents to comply with its requirements to ensure the child receives the prescribed minimum education and then register the child 

Or

  * Refuse to register the child. 

There are also provisions for removing a child's name from the register.
