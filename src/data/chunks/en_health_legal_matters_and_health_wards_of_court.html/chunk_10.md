###  The Ward's property

After the President of the High Court made an order bringing a person into
wardship they gave directions to bring the ward's assets under the control of
the court and make them available for the maintenance and benefit of the ward.

Where it is necessary to sell the Wardâ€™s home to provide for nursing home
expenses or to prevent it from being vandalised, the committee will be
authorised by the court to put the property on the market.

Banks and building society accounts are usually closed and the proceeds lodged
in court.
