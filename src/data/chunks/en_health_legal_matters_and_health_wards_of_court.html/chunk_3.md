##  Changes to the Ward of Court system in April 2023

The [ Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2015/act/64/enacted/en/html) will end
applications to be made a ward of court from 26 April 2023. This new law
provides a detailed legal framework for people who need help to make decisions
about their welfare, property and other affairs and who previously may have
been made a Ward of Court.

The Act introduces new guiding principles about interacting with a person who
has difficulties with their decision-making capacity and establishes a system
of decision support arrangements for these people.

Everyone who is currently a ward of court will have their decision-making
capacity assessed. The courts will decide whether or not they need a decision
supporter.

Within three years, all adult wards of court will be brought under the new
legal framework. If a ward is a still a child after that three year period,
the decision-making capacity review will happen within six months of turning
18.

The courts service has made a [ video for wards of court

wards-courts) and their committees.
