##  Introduction

A person who the courts decided was not able to look after their own affairs
before 26 April 2023 was made a ward of court. Decisions were made on their
behalf by the court or a person appointed by the court known as the committee.

Since 26 April 2023, applications for adults to become a Ward of Court can no
longer be made. The [ Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015
](/en/health/legal-matters-and-health/assisted-decision-making-act/) sets out
a new system for helping people who are having difficulty because they have
reduced or no capacity. There are various different types of Decision Support
Arrangements which depend on your level of capacity at the time the decision
has to be made.

Over the next 3 years, adult wards of court will have their cases reviewed by
the court and will move over to a new decision support arrangement, if
necessary. An application can be made to court by the ward, the wardâ€™s
committee or a close relative or friend to have the case reviewed more
quickly.
