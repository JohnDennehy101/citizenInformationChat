###  Students with literacy difficulties

A student who has at least reached second class and meets all of the following
conditions can also get an exemption:

  * The student has significant literacy difficulty that persists after having access to a differentiated approach to language and literacy over time. This should be documented in a Student Support Plan. 
  * The student has a standardised score at or below the 10th percentile in word reading, reading comprehension or spelling. 

The school must monitor a studentâ€™s needs and programme over time to identify
that the student has significant and persistent literacy difficulties.
