##  How to apply for an exemption from studying Irish

You apply to the school principal for an exemption from studying Irish. You
can get an application form on [ gov.ie ](https://www.gov.ie/en/service/irish-
exemption/)

You should include the reason why you are applying for the exemption. Your
child will only be considered for an exemption if they meet the criteria set
out in the Department of Education circulars on exemption from the study of
Irish - see 'Further information' above.

You must attach documentary evidence of your child's age and previous
schooling if it is relevant to the reason for the exemption.

The school must confirm the outcome of your application, in writing, within 21
working days of getting your application.

You will be issued a certificate of exemption signed by the school principal
if an exemption is granted.
