###  Students with multiple and persistent needs

A student who has at least reached second class and meets all of the following
conditions can get an exemption:

  * The student has a high level of significant, multiple and persistent needs that affect their learning and participation in school life 
  * The student's school has substantial written evidence that the student's needs persist despite a Student Support Plan which has been implemented for at least 2 years 
  * The student has been given every reasonable opportunity to learn Irish in mainstream classes 
  * The principal is satisfied that giving an exemption is in the best interests of the student 

**What are multiple and persistent needs?**

A student has a high level of multiple and persistent needs if their needs are
enduring and severe in nature and significantly affect their daily functioning
at school despite the support of an individualised support programme.
