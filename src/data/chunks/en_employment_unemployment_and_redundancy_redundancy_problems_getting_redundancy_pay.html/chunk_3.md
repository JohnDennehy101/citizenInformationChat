##  What is the Redundancy Payment Scheme?

The Redundancy Payment Scheme is where your statutory redundancy payment is
paid by the Department of Social Protection (DSP) from the Social Insurance
Fund. This happens when your employer is genuinely unable to pay statutory
entitlements because of financial difficulties or insolvency.

The Redundancy Payment Scheme ensures you receive your statutory entitlements.

Once a payment has been made by DSP under the Redundancy Payment Scheme, a
debt will be raised against the employer.
