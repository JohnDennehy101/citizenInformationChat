###  Resolving disputes

If you are renting a room in your landlord’s home and are unhappy with the way
you are being treated, you should try discussing the situation with the
landlord and attempt to resolve any issues between you. You may wish to
contact Threshold, which provides information on housing rights – see 'Where
to apply' below.

If you have exhausted these options, you may be able to take your case to the
Small Claims Court. This is really the only legal recourse you have as a
tenant renting a room in your landlord’s home.

Common claims that are heard by the Small Claims Court include disputes about
retention of your deposit for what you consider unfair reasons, or deductions
from rent for damage to property that is over and above normal 'wear and
tear'.
