###  Agreement with your landlord

Before you arrange to rent a room in your landlordâ€™s home you should agree
some ground rules and put them in writing. If you and your landlord each sign
and keep a copy of this agreement, you can both refer to its terms in the
event of confusion or disagreement. These ground rules might include:

  * How long is the tenancy going to last? 
  * How much notice will either you or your landlord must give if either of you chooses to end the tenancy? 
  * How much rent will you pay and how often (for example, weekly, monthly)? 
  * How will rent be paid (cash, cheque, standing order etc.)? 
  * When will the rent to be reviewed and how much notice will your landlord give you of a rent review? 
  * How utility bills (electricity, gas, phone, water) will be divided between yourself and the landlord? 
  * Will your landlord expect you to contribute towards bin collection charges? 
  * Can you have visitors to stay overnight? 
  * Are there any restrictions regarding noise levels?
