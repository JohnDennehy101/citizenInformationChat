###  Renting a room as a student

If you are a student and are renting in your landlord's house, there is a [
voluntary regulatory framework ](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/be552-rent-
a-room-voluntary-regulatory-framework/) to help set ground rules between you
and your landlord. These have been created by the Department of Further and
Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science along with a [ sample
license agreement (pdf)
](https://assets.gov.ie/271051/4f23c2be-0953-4be0-9ce1-22e67cfa0a2b.docx) . It
is recommended that you agree a written licence agreement with your landlord
before you take up your accommodation offer.

Along with the ground rules listed above, the licence agreement also includes
the following:

  * How much the deposit will be 
  * The date your deposit will be returned to you after the licence agreement has ended 
  * The reasons for which the landlord may keep part of the deposit (for example, unpaid rent or damage to property) 
  * The method used to record that you have paid rent 
  * A list of furniture, provided by the landlord, which you can use exclusively 
  * Any general rules about the landlord's access to your bedroom (such as the notice you will get) 

This licence agreement can be adjusted to suit the needs of the landlord and
the student.
