####  Measures to encourage supply of land for housing

A new scheme is being introduced to refund **stamp duty** on property
transactions in respect of commercial land bought for the development of
housing. To avail of the refund scheme, developers will have to start the
relevant development within 30 months of buying the land.

A **Vacant Site Levy** will be charged from 2019 on lands that are suitable
for housing but are not being developed. A levy of 3% will apply in 2019, as
already planned. The rate will now increase to 7% in the second and subsequent
years.

At present, property owners can get full relief from **Capital Gains Tax** if
they retain qualifying assets for 7 years. This period is being reduced to 4
years.

A new, time-limited **tax deduction for pre-letting expenses** is being
introduced to encourage owners of vacant residential property to bring it into
the rental market for a minimum period of 4 years. The property must have been
vacant for at least 12 months to qualify. A cap on allowable expenses of
â‚¬5,000 per property will apply. This relief will be available for qualifying
expenses incurred up to the end of 2021. It will be subject to clawback if the
property is withdrawn from the rental market within 4 years.
