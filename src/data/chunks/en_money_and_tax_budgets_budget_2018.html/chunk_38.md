####  Brexit Loan Scheme

A new €300m Brexit Loan Scheme will provide affordable financing to Irish
businesses that are either currently impacted by Brexit or will be in the
future. A loan scheme of up to €300m will be made available to small and
medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), along with large firms employing fewer than
500 people, to help with short-term working capital needs.
