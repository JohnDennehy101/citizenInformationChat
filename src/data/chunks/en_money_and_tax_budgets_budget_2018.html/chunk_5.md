###  Universal Social Charge (USC)

Incomes of €13,000 or less will continue to be exempt from USC in 2018. Once
your income is over this limit, you will pay the relevant rate of USC on all
of your income as follows:

  * €0 to €12,012 @ 0.5% 
  * €12,012 to €19,372 @ 2% 
  * €19,372 to €70,044 @ 4.75% 
  * €70,044+ @ 8% 

Medical card holders and individuals aged 70 years and older whose aggregate
income does not exceed €60,000 will now pay a maximum USC rate of 2% (January
2018).
