####  Affordability

An Exchequer allocation of â‚¬75 million is provided for a second phase of the
**Local Infrastructure Housing Activation Fund** , which accelerates the
provision of public infrastructure to support the development of sites for
private housing in urban areas. The fund will also support the delivery of
affordable housing on land owned by local authorities, using co-operative
housing and similar models.
