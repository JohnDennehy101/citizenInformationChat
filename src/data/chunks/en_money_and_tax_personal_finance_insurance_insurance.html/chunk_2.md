##  Introduction

Insurance is a way of protecting yourself from costs due to damage to your
property or your health. A premium is the amount of money you pay to an
insurance company to have an insurance policy to cover you for all or part of
these costs. Insurance companies assess the risk on a particular policy and
then calculate the premium to be charged. You can pay a premium monthly or
annually. The Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC) has [
information that explains how different types of insurance work

Insurance policies are generally renewed once a year. Coming up to renewal
date, you should shop around to see if you are getting the best value for
money.

Different policies have different terms and conditions so make sure you know
what the terms and conditions of your policy are. It is important to
understand exactly what your insurance policy covers when you buy it.
