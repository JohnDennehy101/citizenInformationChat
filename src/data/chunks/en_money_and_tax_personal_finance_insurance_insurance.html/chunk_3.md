###  Home insurance

You are not obliged by law to insure your home but if you have a mortgage most
lenders will insist that your house is properly insured. In general, your
insurance should cover contents as well as the structure of your home.
However, you can get insurance for the contents of your home separately from
insurance for the building, for example, if you are renting and do not own
your home. The CCPC has [ detailed information on home insurance
