##  How much are the individual energy grants?

The table below shows the grant amounts for each individual energy upgrade.
The amount you get for each upgrade depends on the type of home you have. For

If you are applying from [ certain offshore islands
](https://www.seai.ie/grants/home-energy-grants/how-to-apply/List-of-
Islands.pdf) you may get additional grant support.

You may also be able to get the [ Home Energy Upgrade Loan
](/en/housing/housing-grants-and-schemes/grants-for-home-renovations-and-
improvements/home-energy-upgrade-loan-scheme/) to help with the additional
costs of the upgrades that aren’t covered by the grant. These loans are
subsidised by the Government and have lower interest rates than a regular
personal loan. You only qualify for the loan if you are getting a [ home
energy upgrade grant ](https://www.seai.ie/grants/home-energy-grants/home-
energy-upgrade-loan/) from the SEAI.
