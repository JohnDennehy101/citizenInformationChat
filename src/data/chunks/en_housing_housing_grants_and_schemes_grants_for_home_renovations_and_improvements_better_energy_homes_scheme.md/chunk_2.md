##  Introduction

There are grants available to improve the energy efficiency of your property.
The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) administer these grants,
which fall under 3 general schemes:

  * **Better Energy Homes Scheme** : a scheme for homeowners and landlords who want to do certain energy upgrades and manage the process themselves. 
  * [ **Better Energy Warmer Homes scheme** ](/en/housing/housing-grants-and-schemes/grants-for-home-renovations-and-improvements/warmer-homes-scheme/) **:** a scheme for people on low incomes that provides free home energy upgrades. 
  * [ **National Home Energy Upgrade Scheme** ](/en/housing/housing-grants-and-schemes/grants-for-home-renovations-and-improvements/grants-for-a-home-energy-upgrade/) : a scheme for homeowners, landlords and approved housing bodies (AHBs) who want to bring their homes up to a BER rating of B2 or above using a private company to manage the project. 

This page describes the first scheme, the Better Energy Homes Scheme.
