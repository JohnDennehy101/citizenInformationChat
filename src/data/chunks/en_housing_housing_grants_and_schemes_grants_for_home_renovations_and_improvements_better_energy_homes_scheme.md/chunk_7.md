##  How do I access the grants?

There are 2 ways to access these grants:

  * Apply for the grants and manage the contractors and process yourself 
  * Use an SEAI registered company ( [ Home Energy partner ](https://www.seai.ie/grants/home-energy-grants/how-to-apply/energy-partners/) ) to apply for the grants and manage the contractors 

**Note:** You cannot use a Home Energy partner when applying for the [ Solar
PV grant ](/en/housing/housing-grants-and-schemes/grants-for-home-renovations-
and-improvements/grants-for-solar-panels/) , you must do this yourself.

If you are an [ ownersâ€™ management company
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/housing/owning-a-home/home-
owners/management-companies-for-apartment-blocks/#63e738) , you should contact
the SEAI for advice before applying for the grant.
