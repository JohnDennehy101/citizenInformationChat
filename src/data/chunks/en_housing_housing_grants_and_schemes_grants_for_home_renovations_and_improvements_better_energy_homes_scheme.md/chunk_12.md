##  Using a company to manage the grant application and work

You can use a company to apply for the grants and organise the contractors for
you. These companies are called Energy Partners. They are registered with the
SEAI and are authorised to do the work on your home and submit grant
applications for you.

The grant is paid directly to the Energy Partner and they take this off the
cost of the work. Some of these companies also provide finance options so you
have different ways to pay for the outstanding cost of the works.
