###  Medical cards for young people over 16

If you are aged 16–25 and dependent on a parent or guardian, you can get a [
medical card ](/en/health/medical-cards-and-gp-visit-cards/medical-card/) if
your parent or guardian has a medical card. (This does not apply if your
parent or guardian’s income is above the means test limit and they have a
discretionary medical card.)

In the [ medical card means test ](/en/health/medical-cards-and-gp-visit-
cards/medical-card-means-test-under-70s/) , there is an allowance for children
aged over 16. This allowance is increased if the child is in third-level
education and is not getting a grant.
