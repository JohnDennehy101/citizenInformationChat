###  Lay-off and reckonable service

To qualify for statutory redundancy, you must have 104 weeks of _continuous
employment_ with your employer. A period of lay-off will not break your
continuous employment.

How much redundancy pay you qualify for is based on your pay and the length of
your [ reckonable service ](/en/employment/unemployment-and-
redundancy/redundancy/redundancy-payments#lf6d25) . A lay-off that happens in
the 3 year period before your employment ends does not count towards your
reckonable service.
