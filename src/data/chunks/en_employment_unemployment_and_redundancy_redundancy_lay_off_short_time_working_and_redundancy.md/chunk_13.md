###  Step 1: Give your employer your written notice

You must give your written notice of your intention to claim redundancy
payment in respect of the lay off-off or short- time. The best way to do this
is by using Part B of [ form RP9 (pdf)
](http://www.workplacerelations.ie/en/Publications_Forms/Lay_Off_and_Short_Term_Procedures_Form_RP9_.pdf)
.

You do not have to give notice as soon as you have been laid off or kept on
short-time. You can chose to wait longer. If the short-time or lay-off stops
and you decide to claim redundancy payment, you must give notice within 4
weeks after the lay-off or short-time working ends. Once this deadline passes,
you are no longer entitled to claim a payment in respect of the period of lay-
off or short-time.
