##  What is the difference between a lay off and short-time working?

**Lay-off**

You can be facing a lay-off if your employer:

  * Cannot provide work for you 
  * Believes this is a temporary situation 
  * Gives you notification of the lay off before the work finishes 

If you are laid off, while you may not be working, you are still an employee
of the company. This means that, although, you are not being paid, you have
rights.

**Short-time working**

Short-time working refers to a specific temporary situation where either:

  * Your weekly pay is less than half your normal weekly pay 
  * The hours you work are reduced to less than half of your normal weekly working hours 

Your employer must notify you of the reduction in hours or pay (or both)
before short-time working starts.
