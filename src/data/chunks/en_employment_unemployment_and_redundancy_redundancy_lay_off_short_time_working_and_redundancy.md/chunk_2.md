##  Lay-offs and short-time working

Your employer may lay you off or reduce your working hours (put you on short-
time) for a number of weeks. This can happen if there is a lack of work
available or changes to the financial circumstances of the business.

The difference between a lay off and short-time can be confusing and you have
different rights in each situation.

A lay-off is when your employer tells you that they expect you to have **no
work** for a temporary period and you will not be paid. If a lay-off goes on
for certain period of time, you may be entitled to claim for [ redundancy
](/en/employment/unemployment-and-redundancy/redundancy/what-is-redundancy/) .

On the other hand, short-time working is when your hours and pay **are
reduced** due to a decrease in work.
