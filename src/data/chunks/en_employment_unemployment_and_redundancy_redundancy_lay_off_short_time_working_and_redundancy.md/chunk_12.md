##  How to claim redundancy from your employer

You can claim redundancy if you are on a lay-off or short-time working or a
combination of both for either:

  * At least 4 consecutive weeks 
  * 6 weeks within the last 13 weeks 

You may be entitled to a [ redundancy payment ](/en/employment/unemployment-
and-redundancy/redundancy/redundancy-payments/) provided that you [ qualify
for redundancy. ](/en/employment/unemployment-and-redundancy/redundancy/right-
to-redundancy-pay/)

When you claim for redundancy in a lay-off situation, you are stating that you
believe that your employer cannot offer you work. And you want to be released
from your contract, wish to receive your redundancy payment and want to look
for new work.

A lay-off does not involve the termination of your contract of employment,
whereas a redundancy does.
