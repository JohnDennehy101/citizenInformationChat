##  Loans

Credit unions can make loans to members. For example, loans may be for:

  * Car purchase 
  * Home improvement 
  * Education 
  * Holidays 
  * Bridging loans 
  * Special occasions, weddings or Christmas 
  * Medical or emergencies 

The credit union may require security for the loan – this depends on the
credit union’s own rules.

The minimum and maximum loan amount is set locally by each credit union.

The maximum repayment term on unsecured loans is 10 years and on secured loans
is 35 years.

Your ability to repay the loan is taken into account when you apply for a
loan. Each loan application is assessed on an individual basis, in line with
lending regulations and the credit union’s lending policy.

The credit union must have an appeals process in place for a member who is
refused a loan.

The rate of interest charged on the loans is decided by the board of
directors. The interest on the loan may not be more than 1% per month.

Some credit unions offer the [ It Makes Sense ](/en/money-and-tax/personal-
finance/loans-and-credit/microcredit-loans/) loan, which provides small loans
at low interest rates. The loan may be available if you are getting a social
welfare payment and are having difficulty getting credit from other sources.
You can get a list of participating credit unions on the [ It Makes Sense Loan
website ](https://itmakessenseloan.ie/) .

Many credit unions offer mortgages. The interest rate charged is set by each
credit union at local level and each credit union also sets the maximum value
of mortgage which it provides. You can check a list of [ local credit unions
that provide mortgages ](https://www.creditunion.ie/what-we-offer/mortgages/)

The Central Bank's [ Credit Union Handbook

unions on various aspects of lending.
