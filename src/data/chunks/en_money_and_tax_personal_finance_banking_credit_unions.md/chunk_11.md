##  Regulation

The main legislation governing credit unions is the [ Credit Union Act 1997
](https://revisedacts.lawreform.ie/eli/1997/act/15/front/revised/en/html) .
Credit unions are also subject to various aspects of the Central Bank Acts as
well as, for example, anti-money laundering and data protection legislation.

The [ Registry of Credit Unions
](http://www.centralbank.ie/regulation/industry-sectors/credit-
unions/Pages/default.aspx) , which is part of the [ Central Bank of Ireland
](https://www.centralbank.ie/) , is responsible for the registration,
regulation and supervision of credit unions.

The Central Bank has the power to impose conditions on the registration of a
credit union. These conditions may be appealed to the [ Irish Financial
Services Appeals Tribunal ](http://www.ifsat.ie/) . Regulatory decisions may
also be appealed to this tribunal.

The main function of the Registrar of Credit Unions is to regulate credit
unions to:

  * Protect members' savings in each credit union 
  * Maintain the financial stability and wellbeing of credit unions generally 

Credit unions who want to engage in certain types of business, for example,
insurance, investment intermediary, and certain payment services must get
authorisation from the Central Bank.

The Central Bank publishes the [ Credit Union Handbook
](http://www.centralbank.ie/regulation/industry-sectors/credit-
unions/Pages/Credit%20Union%20Handbook.aspx) which sets out various legal and
regulatory requirements and guidance for credit unions.
