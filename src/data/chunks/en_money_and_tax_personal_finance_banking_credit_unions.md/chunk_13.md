##  Complaints

Credit unions must have a complaints procedure in place.

If you are not satisfied with the outcome of the internal procedure, you can
complain to the [ Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman
](/en/consumer/how-to-complain/complain-about-financial-services/) .

The Ombudsman is an independent officer whose remit is to investigate, mediate
and adjudicate unresolved complaints of individual customers about financial
service providers and pension providers.
