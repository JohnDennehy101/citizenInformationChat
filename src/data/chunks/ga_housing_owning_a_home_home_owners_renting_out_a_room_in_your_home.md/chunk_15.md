###  **Situations where my payment will be affected**

In certain situations rental income of less than â‚¬14,000 a year for renting a
room will be taken into account and can affect your social welfare payment.
This applies if you rent a room in your home:

  * As a short-term let. Short-term lets are stays that do not exceed 28 days in a row 
  * To an employee 
  * To an immediate family member 

Immediate family members in this situation include:

  * Your spouse, civil partner or partner 
  * Your child, or the spouse of your child 
  * Your parent, step-parent or parent-in-law 
  * Your sibling, including step-siblings or siblings-in-law 
  * Your grandparent or your grandchild 
  * Your aunt or uncle 
  * Your nephew or niece
