###  How does scheme work?

If you want to rent a room in your local authority home to a third-level
student, there are certain steps you must follow:

  1. You advertise the room you want to rent. You can [ advertise the room on student accommodation websites, college and university websites ](https://www.gov.ie/en/service/b1d3f-find-and-advertise-student-accommodation-and-digs/?referrer=http://www.gov.ie/roomforastudent/#accommodation-links-by-institution) and in other media. 
  2. The student must view the room before agreeing to rent it. You and the student must agree that the accommodation and renting arrangement suit you both. 
  3. You and the student must apply separately to your local authority to take part in the scheme. You will find the application forms on your [ local authority’s ](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/942f74-local-authorities/) website. 
  4. If the application is successful, the student can rent your room for the academic year. At the end of the academic year, the student should leave the property. 

If you and the student want to continue the arrangement for the next academic
year, you must get the local authority’s consent.
