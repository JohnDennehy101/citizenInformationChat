###  **One-to-one sessions with Intreo**

Depending on your circumstances, you may be scheduled to attend one-to-one
sessions with an Employment Personal Adviser to discuss:

  * Employment opportunities 
  * Training courses 
  * Financial supports 
  * Other options which may lead to employment. 

If you are getting a jobseekerâ€™s payment, you will get on-going appointments
to monitor your progression towards employment, training, or education.
