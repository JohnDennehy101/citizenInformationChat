##  Employment and antenatal visits

If you become pregnant while you are employed, you are [ entitled to paid time
off work to attend antenatal appointments
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1995/si/18/made/en/print) .

You should tell your employer in writing (providing medical evidence of your
pregnancy) that you need time off to attend antenatal appointments. You should
give at least 2 weeks' written notice of the date and time of your
appointments.

If this notice is not given for reasons out of your control, then you can
retain your entitlement, provided you write to your employer with an
explanation and with the notice. You will need to do this within 1 week of the
appointment.

For any visit after the first appointment, your employer may ask to see your
appointment card. You are entitled to medical visits after the birth of your
baby for 14 weeks following the birth, including any period taken on [
maternity leave ](/en/employment/employment-rights-and-conditions/leave-and-
holidays/maternity-leave/) following the birth.
