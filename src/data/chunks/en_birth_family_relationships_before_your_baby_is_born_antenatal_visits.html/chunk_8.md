###  At 20-22 weeks

You have reached the halfway point of your pregnancy.

You may be offered a foetal anomaly or anatomy scan at the hospital. Some
hospitals offer this to every pregnant woman and other hospitals can only
offer this to women with higher risk pregnancies. Most scans will show you
that your baby is developing normally. However, sometimes a baby is born with
a health problem. A foetal anatomy scan will detect many of these problems.

If an anomaly is detected, a referral will be made to an obstetrician who
specialises in foetal anomalies. This allows you and your obstetrician to make
plans for the birth and for any aftercare you and your baby may need.
