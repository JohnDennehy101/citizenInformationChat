##  Antenatal visits

Many hospitals have made changes to how they deliver their services due to
COVID-19. If you have an upcoming antenatal visit, you may have to attend your
appointment alone. **Check what visitor restrictions are in place with your
maternity hospital/unit.** The HSE has up-to-date information on hospitals in
every county so you can check about [ appointments and what visitor
restrictions are in place ](https://www2.hse.ie/services/hospital-service-
disruptions/hospital-service-disruptions-covid19.html#local-hospital-updates)
before you go.
