Antenatal classes cover a wide range of topics such as pain relief, [
breastfeeding ](/en/birth-family-relationships/after-your-baby-is-
born/breastfeeding/) , nutrition, maintaining a healthy lifestyle, and
preparing you and your family for the birth of your baby. Most hospitals offer
antenatal classes (sometimes called parent craft classes) which you can attend
near the time of birth. Your partner or a friend can attend these classes with
you.

If you are an expectant mother, [ you are entitled to attend 1 set of classes
(except the last 3 in a set)
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2004/en/act/pub/0028/index.html) over all
your pregnancies while in employment. For example, if you are attending a set
of 8 classes and this is your first pregnancy in employment, you are only
entitled to paid time off work to attend 5 of those classes. The last 3
classes would normally occur after your maternity leave has started.

If you are an expectant father, you have [ a once-off right to attend the 2
classes immediately prior to the birth
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2004/en/si/0653.html) .
