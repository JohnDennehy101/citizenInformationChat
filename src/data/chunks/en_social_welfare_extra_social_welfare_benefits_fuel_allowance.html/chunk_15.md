##  How your income is assessed for Fuel Allowance

Fuel Allowance is a means-tested payment. This means that the Department of
Social Protection (DSP) examines all your sources of income. Your gross weekly
income must be below a certain amount to pass the means test.

You are usually accepted as passing the means test for Fuel Allowance, if you
are getting a qualifying social assistance (means-tested) payment.

If you get a means-tested payment, you have already satisfied the means test
and it does not need to be done again.
