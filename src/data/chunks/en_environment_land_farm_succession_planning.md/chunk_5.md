###  **Plan for your retirement**

You will need to consider how you will manage financially when you transfer
the farm. For example

  * Will you be old enough to get the [ old-age pension ](/en/social-welfare/older-and-retired-people/state-pension-contributory/) or a [ private pension ](/en/money-and-tax/personal-finance/pensions/personal-pensions/) ? 
  * Will you still get an income from the farm? 

You may also need to consider housing arrangements if you are currently living
on the farm.
