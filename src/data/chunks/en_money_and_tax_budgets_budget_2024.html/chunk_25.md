###  Tax relief for landlords

A temporary rental income tax relief is being introduced to support private
landlords. The relief will be available against some rental income at the
standard rate of 20% each year. It will be available from 2024 to 2027 and
will only apply if the landlord keeps their rental property in the rental
market for the next four years. Landlords can get 20% of:

  * €3,000 for 2024 
  * €4,000 for 2025 
  * €5,000 for 2026 and 2027 

The relief will reduce the tax due on rental income by up to €600 in 2024,
€800 in 2025, and €1,000 in 2026 and 2027. The relief will be clawed back if
the landlord leaves the rental market during this time.
