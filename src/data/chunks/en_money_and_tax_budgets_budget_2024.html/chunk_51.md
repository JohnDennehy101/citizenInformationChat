###  **Support for part-time students**

From September 2024, a new pilot scheme will be available for part-time
undergraduate students who are attending eligible part-time programmes, in-
person or online, leading to a major award at Level 6, 7 or 8 on the National
Framework of Qualifications (NFQ).

The scheme rules are still being developed, but it is expected that the
following will apply:

  * The undergraduate programme must take place in the State and lead to a major award at Level 6, 7 or 8 on the NFQ. 
  * Students must meet nationality, residency, and progression criteria. 
  * Specified publicly funded undergraduate part-time blended and part-time online programmes will be eligible. 
  * Applicants with reckonable incomes under €55,924 will be able to apply – a SUSI administered means test will determine eligibility.
