###  Telling the college about your disability

If you have a disability, a specific learning difficulty or a significant
ongoing illness, you can let the third-level institution know about it -
either during the application process or at any time during your course - so
that they can consider, in consultation with yourself, any specific support
needs you may have in college.

If you choose to give this information during the application process (though
you are not obliged to do this) you should tick the relevant box on your
application form to the Central Applications Office (CAO). Giving this
information on the form will not adversely affect your application in any way.
In fact, it is by ticking this box that you get the option of the Disability
Access Route to Education - see below.
