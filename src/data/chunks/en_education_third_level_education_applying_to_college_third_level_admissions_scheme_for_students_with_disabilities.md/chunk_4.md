##  How the DARE scheme works

The [ Disability Access Route to Education
](http://www.accesscollege.ie/dare/index.php) (DARE) aims to improve access to
college for school-leavers with a disability or specific learning difficulty
by allocating a number of third-level places to them on a reduced points
basis.
