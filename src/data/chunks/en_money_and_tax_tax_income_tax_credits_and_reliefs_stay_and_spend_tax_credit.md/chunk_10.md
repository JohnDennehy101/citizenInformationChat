####  Stage 2: Make a claim online

If you pay tax through PAYE you can make your claim by submitting the Income
tax return (Form 12) for the 2020 period in [ myAccount
](https://www.ros.ie/myaccount-web/sign_in.html?execution=e2s1&lang=en) .

If you are self-employed you can make your claim by submitting the Form 11 for
the 2020 period in [ ROS ](https://www.ros.ie/) .

You should submit your receipts (as proof of expenditure) before you submit
your return – see **‘Stage 1’** above.

You can get a step by step guide on how to upload a receipt and submit a claim
