##  How will the relief be given?

The Stay and Spend Tax Credit will reduce the amount of income tax you have to
pay (known as your _income tax liability_ ). The credit is deducted after all
other allowances, deductions or reliefs have been given to you.

If the tax credit is higher than your income tax liability in the year of
assessment, any excess credit can be taken away from the USC you have to pay
in that same year.

The credit can be used to reduce your liability to income tax and USC in the
year of assessment to nil. In cases where the tax credit available is higher
than your combined liabilities to income tax and USC in the year of
assessment, you will be unable to fully use the credit due to you.
