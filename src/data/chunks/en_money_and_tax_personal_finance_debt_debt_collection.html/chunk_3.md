##  Contact between lenders and consumers

Under the [ Consumer Protection Code 2012
](https://www.centralbank.ie/regulation/consumer-protection/consumer-
protection-codes-regulations#unofficial-consolidation) , a lender that is
regulated by the Central Bank cannot phone you about your loan without your
agreement between 9pm and 9am from Monday to Saturday or at any time on a
Sunday or public holiday. They can only visit you in person if you have agreed
to the visit.

The lender is not allowed to call you or to visit you at your workplace unless
you are also living there, or unless all reasonable efforts to contact you
elsewhere have failed. Only the person involved in the loan can be contacted
about it. This means that your lender cannot contact your employer or a member
of your family about your loan.

To check whether a financial services firm is regulated by the Central Bank,
