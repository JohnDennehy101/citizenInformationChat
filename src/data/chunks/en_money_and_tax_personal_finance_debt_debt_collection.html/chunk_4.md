##  Private debt collectors

Instead of seeking repayment from you themselves, creditors sometimes sell the
debt to a private collection agency. Such agencies are not subject to
authorisation and supervision by the Central Bank.

However, if a lender that is regulated by the Central Bank outsources its debt
collection activities, any agent acting on its behalf must meet the
requirements of Irish financial services law. If it does not, the Central Bank
can impose penalties on the lender.

If a regulated lender plans to appoint a third party to engage with you about
arrears that you owe, it must write to you and explain their role.
