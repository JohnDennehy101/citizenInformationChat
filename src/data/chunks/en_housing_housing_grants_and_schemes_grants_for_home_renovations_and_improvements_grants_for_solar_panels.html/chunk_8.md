###  Do I need planning permission for solar panels?

You do not need [ planning permission ](/en/housing/planning-
permission/planning-permission-for-altering-a-house/) to install solar panels
at your home as long as you meet certain conditions. However, ask your local
authority for guidance about planning permission if:

  * Your home is a protected structure 
  * You home is in a protected area, for example, an architectural conservation area
