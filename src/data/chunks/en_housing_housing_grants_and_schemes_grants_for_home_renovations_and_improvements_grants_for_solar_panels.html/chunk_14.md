###  Homeowner records

During the upgrade works, you will get documents from the company doing the
work. You should keep these documents in a safe place so you can have them for
your BER assessor, or if you are inspected by the SEAI.

The SEAI recommends you keep all this information together in a safe place for
future reference. It may also be useful if you want to sell your house or if
there is a problem with any of the work.
