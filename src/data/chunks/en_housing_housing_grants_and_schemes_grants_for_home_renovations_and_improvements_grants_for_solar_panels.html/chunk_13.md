###  After the works are completed

Your installer will give you the documentation you need to claim the grant,
including the signed Declaration of Works form. You should keep these
documents for your records. Your installer will also complete and upload a
number of documents about the work to the SEAI website. SEAI has a [ solar PV
completion checklist (pdf) ](https://www.seai.ie/publications/Solar-PV-Grant-
Completion-Checklist.pdf) that lists the documents needed.

SEAI will then check if your installation meets the scheme requirements. Once
all conditions are met, SEAI will then process your payment which will be paid
by electronic funds transfer (EFT) into your bank account.
