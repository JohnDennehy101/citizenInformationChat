##  How much is the grant?

The grant you get depends on the peak output of your solar system. Peak output
is measured in kWp, which is kilowatt-peak. You get:

  * €800 per kWp for up 2kWp 
  * €250 for every additional kWp up to 4kWp 

This means you will get:

  * €800 for 1kWp 
  * €1,600 for 2kWp 
  * €1,850 for 3kWp 
  * €2,100 for 4kWp 

In 2024, the grant is capped at €2,100. The Government plans to reduce the
grant by up to €300 every year, as it expects the cost of solar panel systems
to reduce over time. It is intended that the grant will end in 2029.

The grant covers materials and labour, unless you are a contractor doing the
work in your own home. In this case, only the cost of the materials is
covered.

If the cost of the systems and labour (including [ VAT ](/en/money-and-
tax/tax/duties-and-vat/value-added-tax/) ) is less than the maximum grant
amount, you will get a grant for the actual cost.

**Note:** You are only eligible for the grant once.
