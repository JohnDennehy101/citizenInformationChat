###  Insulating your home before getting solar panels

SEAI recommends that you insulate your home before considering solar panels,
as insulation is the easiest way to reduce your energy costs. You can apply
for the following grants with the SEAI to insulate your home and improve its
overall energy efficiency:

  * [ Better Energy Homes Scheme ](/en/housing/housing-grants-and-schemes/grants-for-home-renovations-and-improvements/better-energy-homes-scheme/)
  * [ Better Energy Warmer Homes Scheme ](/en/housing/housing-grants-and-schemes/grants-for-home-renovations-and-improvements/warmer-homes-scheme/)
  * [ National Home Energy Upgrade Scheme ](/en/housing/housing-grants-and-schemes/grants-for-home-renovations-and-improvements/grants-for-a-home-energy-upgrade/)

Some of these schemes include the Solar Electricity Grant as one of their
energy efficiency measures. However, you may have to apply for it separately.
