###  Choosing a contractor

Before choosing a company from the registered list, the SEAI recommend that
you get a number of quotes and compare the offers, and request and check the
companyâ€™s references.

You must have a contract in place with the contractor to ensure that you have
a suitable level of consumer protection. SEAI have a [ sample contract (pdf)
](https://www.seai.ie/publications/Model-Contract.pdf) on their website to
help with this.
