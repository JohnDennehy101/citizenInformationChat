###  Joint tenancy

Joint tenancy is the most common type of co-ownership title. _Joint tenancy_
means you both co-own the property in **equal shares** . You cannot sell or
rent the property without your cohabitant’s consent. If one cohabitant dies,
the other person will automatically own all of the property.

However, if you are not married or civil partners and your partner dies, you
(the surviving joint tenant of the property) may be liable for [ Capital
Acquisition Tax ](/en/money-and-tax/tax/capital-taxes/capital-acquisitions-
tax/) as a result of becoming full owner of the property through survivorship.
Your partner is effectively ‘gifting’ you their share of the property, but
because you are not married (or civil partners), you may have to pay Capital
Acquisition Tax which is applicable to gifts and inheritances.

You can be co-owners in a joint tenancy even if one person contributes more
financially to the property than the other person. However, if one person has
paid more for the property and the house is sold at a later date, the other
person may, in some circumstances, get less than 50% of the proceeds.

Similarly, if you contribute a smaller amount to the purchase price of the
property, your cohabitant is effectively ‘gifting’ you a larger part of your
property entitlement. In the event that your cohabitant dies, this ‘gift’ may
be liable for Capital Acquisition Tax.

As there may be tax implications for cohabitants in a joint tenancy, you
should always get professional legal advice. See ‘Getting legal advice’ below.
