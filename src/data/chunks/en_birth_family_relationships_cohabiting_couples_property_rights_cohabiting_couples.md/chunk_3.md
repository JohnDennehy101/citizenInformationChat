##  Cohabitation agreements

Couples who live together can choose to enter into a _cohabitation agreement_
(also called a _cohabitant’s agreement_ ). This is a signed contract setting
out your financial interests if your relationship should end (including what
will happen to certain assets, such as your shared property).

In the event of a break-up, a cohabitation agreement can make the division of
your assets more straightforward.

You and your partner must [ get legal advice ](/en/birth-family-
relationships/cohabiting-couples/property-rights-and-unmarried-couples#lea601)
before entering into a cohabitant’s agreement, and it must be **signed by both
of you** to be valid. Once signed, the agreement can be enforced by the court.

In exceptional circumstances, the court can _vary_ (change aspects of) or _set
aside_ your cohabitation agreement, where enforcing it would cause serious
injustice.
