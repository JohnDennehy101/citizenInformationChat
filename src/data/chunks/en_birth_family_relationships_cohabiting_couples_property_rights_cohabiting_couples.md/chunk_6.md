###  Tenancy in common

_Tenancy in common_ means 2 people own the property in **defined shares** ,
for example, 50/50, 75/25, 60/40.

Each person can leave their share of the property to whoever they wish
(including their partner), but they must [ make a will ](/en/death/before-a-
death/making-a-will/) stating this fact.

If you do not make a will, your share of the property becomes _part of your
estate_ if you die. Your partner may be forced to sell the home to allow the
administration of your estate.

In addition, your family (or even a separated spouse or civil partner) can
claim this share. Your surviving partner does not have any automatic right to
your share of the property.
