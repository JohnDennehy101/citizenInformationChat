##  Getting legal advice

If you are buying (or considering buying) a property with your partner, you
should get legal advice to find the best ownership option for you.

Solicitors' fees can vary considerably so shop around and get some quotes
before deciding who to use. Find [ contact details for solicitors

Contact [ your nearest law centre ](https://www.legalaidboard.ie/en/contact-

legal aid and advice ](/en/justice/legal-aid-and-advice/civil-legal-advice-
and-legal-aid/) from the Legal Aid Board, you must generally pay a
contribution towards the costs.

clinics throughout the country. These clinics are confidential, free of charge
