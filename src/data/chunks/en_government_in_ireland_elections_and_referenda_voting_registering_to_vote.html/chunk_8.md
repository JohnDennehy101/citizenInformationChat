##  Updating your details

You can now update your details at any time during the year. The easiest way
to do this is on [ checktheregister.ie ](https://www.checktheregister.ie/en-
IE/forms) .

You must change your details at least 15 days before polling day. Sundays,
public holidays and Good Friday are not counted as days for this purpose.

If you are already registered, you should check your details and add your PPS
number, date of birth and your Eircode on checktheregister.ie. This will allow
the local authority to check your details are correct. Your PPS number and
date of birth will not be published on the electoral register.
