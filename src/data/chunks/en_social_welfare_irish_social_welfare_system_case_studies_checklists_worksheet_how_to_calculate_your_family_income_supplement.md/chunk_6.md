###  Step 2: Take away your total income from the maximum income limit for
your family size

In the table below, find the maximum income limit for a family with the number
of children you have. From this maximum income limit for your family size,
take away your total family income.

**Working Family Payment income limits from 4 January 2024**

**If you have:** |  **And your weekly family income is less than:**  
---|---  
One child  |  €645   
Two children  |  €746   
Three children  |  €847   
Four children  |  €938   
Five children  |  €1,064   
Six children  |  €1,180   
Seven children  |  €1,316   
Eight or more children  |  €1,412   
  
For example, if you have 3 children and your weekly total family income is
€350, the maximum family income for a family of your size is €847 (see table
above).

The difference between €350 and €847 is €497.
