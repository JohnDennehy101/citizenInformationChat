###  Step 3: Get 60% of the difference between your total family income and
the maximum income limit set for a family of your size

To find out the WFP rate you will get: calculate 60% of the difference between
your total family income and the maximum income limit set for a family of your
size.

For example, if you have 3 children and your weekly total family income is
€350, the maximum family income for a family of your size is €847 (see table
above). The difference between €350 and €847 is €497.

Your rate of WFP is 60% of €497. In this case, €298.20 is 60% of €497. Your
WFP rate is €298 (rounded).
