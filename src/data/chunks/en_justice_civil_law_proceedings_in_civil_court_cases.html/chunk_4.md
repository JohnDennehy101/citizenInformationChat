##  Assessments only

If the defendant admits that they are to blame and you are not happy with the
amount offered in settlement of damages, then the matter will be sent to a
court to determine the amount of damages you are entitled to.

In this situation, the court does not consider the question of who is to
blame. The judge will merely place a value on your case based on an
examination of the nature and extent of your injuries and losses to date and
into the future.

This examination will be conducted by considering the available medical
evidence relating to your injuries and any evidence in relation to your
financial losses and expenses. You may be asked to produce receipts and bills
to prove you have incurred all of these expenses so it is important to keep a
file of every bill and receipt.

If you have been injured as a result of any wrongdoing, you will likely be
called as a witness so that you can describe your injuries.
