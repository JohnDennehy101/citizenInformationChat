##  Liability in issue

If the defendant in the case has not admitted they are at fault, the trial
will take the following format;

  * Your [ barrister ](/en/justice/courtroom/barristers/) will outline to the court the nature of the case and the injuries and losses you suffered. 
  * Medical evidence relating to your injuries may be given by a doctor if appropriate to your case. 
  * An engineer, or other expert, may be called to give evidence if necessary. 
  * Accountants or actuaries may be called to calculate any loss of earnings. 
  * You are called to give evidence:   
\- This will involve swearing on oath and answering the questions posed to you
by your barrister as clearly and concisely as possible. You will give evidence
relating to the alleged wrongdoing occurred, your injuries and your losses.  
\- When your barrister has finished asking you questions, you will be cross-
examined by the barrister on the other side. The object of cross-examination
is to discover the truth so you may be asked questions about inconsistencies
in your evidence. You may also be told what the defendant or their witnesses
say is the true version of events and asked to comment on their evidence.  

  * All the other [ witnesses ](/en/justice/witnesses/being-a-witness/) on your side give [ evidence ](/en/justice/evidence/evidence-introduction/) and are cross-examined. 
  * The defendant's witnesses are each called to the witness box and give evidence. Your barrister may cross-examine each one of them. 
  * When all the witnesses have been called, both barristers may make submissions to the judge. This may include summarising or emphasising certain evidence or making legal arguments. 
  * You have to prove your case on the balance of probabilities. In other words, you must prove that the wrongdoing happened and caused your injuries and losses. 
  * A judge will make the decision on:   
\- Whether the defendant is at fault and therefore liable to pay damages to
you

\- The amount of damages to which you are entitled as a result of your losses
and injuries

\- Who shall pay the costs of the proceedings.

  * A limited number of cases are heard before a judge and a jury, such as defamation actions. In these cases, the jury will ultimately decide whether the defendant is at fault and the amount of any damages. 

The length of case will be determined by the length of the evidence and the
submissions made.

Usually, if you have won the case, the judge will order that the defendant pay
your reasonable legal costs as well as their own. If you lose, it is likely
you will have to pay the costs of both sides.
