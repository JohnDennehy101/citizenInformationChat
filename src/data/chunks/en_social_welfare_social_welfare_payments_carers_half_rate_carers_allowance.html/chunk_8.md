###  Change of circumstance

You may continue to be regarded as providing full-time care and attention if
you or the person being cared for is undergoing medical or other treatment in
a hospital or other institution for a period not longer than 13 weeks. If you
are getting half-rate Carerâ€™s Allowance for a child, it can be paid for up to
6 months if the child is in hospital.

Half-rate Carer's Allowance continues to be paid for a period of 12 weeks if
the person being cared for moves permanently into a residential care or
nursing home. You must contact the Carer's Allowance Section with the date of
the permanent move.

Carer's Allowance continues to be paid for 12 weeks after the death of the
person being cared for.
