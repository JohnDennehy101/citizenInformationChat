##  Rules

You must meet the qualifying criteria for Carer’s Allowance. For example, the
person you are caring for must be so incapacitated as to require full-time
care and attention and you must satisfy a means test. There is more
information in our page about [ Carer’s Allowance ](/en/social-
welfare/carers/carers-allowance/) .

If you satisfy the conditions for Carer’s Allowance, it will be awarded at 50%
of the rate that would apply if you were not getting any other payment. You
will also be eligible for the [ Carer's Support Grant ](/en/social-
welfare/carers/carers-support-grant/) and a [ Free Travel Pass ](/en/social-
welfare/extra-social-welfare-benefits/free-travel/) . You may also be eligible
for the [ Household Benefits Package ](/en/social-welfare/extra-social-
welfare-benefits/household-benefits-package/) .

The half-rate Carer’s Allowance is disregarded in the means test for [ Fuel
Allowance ](/en/social-welfare/extra-social-welfare-benefits/fuel-allowance/)
.
