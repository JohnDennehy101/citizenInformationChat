####  Judicial review

A challenge brought in the High Court to the decision of a lower court or an
administrative body. A [ judicial review ](/en/government-in-ireland/how-
government-works/standards-and-accountability/judicial-review-public-
decisions/) is separate to an appeal as it tends to focus on the validity of
the decision-making process and not the merits of the decision itself.
