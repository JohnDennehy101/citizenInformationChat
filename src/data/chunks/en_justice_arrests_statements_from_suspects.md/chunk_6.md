###  **Statement taken in breach of Judge’s Rules**

There is a difference between a statement you made involuntarily and a
statement taken in breach of the Judges’ Rules.

An involuntary statement must be excluded in a trial, but a statement taken in
breach of the Judges’ Rules _can_ be allowed by the judge (if the judge
decides). This is because the Judge’s Rules do not have the force of law. So,
the judge has discretion to include or exclude such statements.
