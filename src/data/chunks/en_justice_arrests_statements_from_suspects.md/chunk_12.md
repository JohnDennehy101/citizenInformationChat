###  **You must be given a caution**

If you decide to make a statement as a suspect, the Gardaí must tell you of
your right to remain silent.

This caution must also be included in the top line of the written statement.

The Gardaí should not cross-examine you if you are making a statement.
However, Gardaí can ask you questions to clarify anything you say which is
unclear.
