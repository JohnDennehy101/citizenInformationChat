##  Free and voluntary statements and confessions

The most important aspect of a confession (or statement) is whether you
volunteered it.

If you make a confession (verbally or in writing), before a trial or court
case, it can only be used as proof against you if it was a free and voluntary
confession.

Your confession is free and voluntary, if you are not influenced by hope or
fear, from a threat, a promise or wrongful persuasion.
