###  **Signing your statement**

The Gardaí then ask you to sign the statement. The signature should be written
on the next available line and should be witnessed by those present. In the
case of a juvenile, the signature should also be witnessed by a parent, adult
relative or guardian.

If you refuse to sign the statement, the Gardaí insert the words “Declined to
sign” and they include your reasons for refusing. If you cannot read or write,
you are asked to make a mark in place of a signature.
