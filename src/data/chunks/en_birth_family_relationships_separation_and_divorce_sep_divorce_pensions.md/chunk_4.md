###  **Types of pension adjustment orders**

A pension scheme can cover different types of benefits. For the purposes of
pension adjustment orders, these benefits are broken into:

  * **Contingent benefits** \- death in service benefits under a pension scheme 
  * **Retirement benefits** \- all other benefits payable under a pension scheme 

A pension scheme member may be eligible for one or both types of benefits.
Each type of benefit must be applied for separately under different pension
adjustment orders.

A pension adjustment order on contingent benefits can only be made up to a
year after a divorce or legal separation has been granted and the pension
adjustment order ends if the member spouse leaves the relevant employment. A
pension adjustment order on retirement benefits can be made at any time.
