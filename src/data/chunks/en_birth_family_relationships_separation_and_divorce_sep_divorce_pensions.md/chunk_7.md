##  How do I get information on pension benefits?

If legal proceedings have started, each spouse, civil partner, qualified
cohabitant must give the details of their property and income to the other
spouse, civil partner, qualified cohabitant (or to a person representing any
dependent children). Property and income include rights acquired under a
pension scheme.

With the agreement of the member spouse, civil partner, or qualified
cohabitant, the trustees should, if possible, provide the information
voluntarily to avoid the expense of obtaining a court order. If this is not
possible, the court may direct pension scheme trustees to provide more
specific information in relation to pension benefits. The trustees must
provide the information within the period specified by the court.

This is set out in the [ Pensions Act 1990
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1990/en/act/pub/0025/index.html) .
