###  Leaving your job

When you leave your job, your employer will enter your leaving date and
details about your final pay and deductions into Revenue’s online system.

You can then see your pay and income tax details for your old job through the
[ ‘Manage your tax’ link in myAccount ](https://www.revenue.ie/en/online-
services/services/manage-your-record/manage-your-tax-for-the-current-year-
paye-customers.aspx) .

You won’t receive a P45 from your employer when you leave.
