###  Starting your new job

When you start your new job, your new employer will inform Revenue of your
start date. This creates a new employment record for you and lets your new
employer access updated tax credits and tax rate bands for you.

Revenue will send a Revenue payroll notification (RPN) to your new employer.
The RPN will tell your employer how much income tax and universal Social
Charge (USC) to deduct from your pay.

If you are starting your first job in Ireland, you must register it in the
jobs and pensions section of Revenueâ€™s online service myAccount.

You can find more information about how to do this in our page about [ online
services for PAYE taxpayers ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/money-and-
tax/tax/income-tax/online-services-for-paye-taxpayers/) .
