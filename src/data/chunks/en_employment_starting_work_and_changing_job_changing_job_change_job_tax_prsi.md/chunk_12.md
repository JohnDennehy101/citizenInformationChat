####  **Can I get a refund of pension contributions?**

If you have less than 2 years' contributions, you can get a refund of your own
contributions. This refund will be taxed, because you got tax relief when you
made the contribution.

Before leaving your job, talk to the person responsible for administering the
pension scheme, as each scheme has its own rules.
