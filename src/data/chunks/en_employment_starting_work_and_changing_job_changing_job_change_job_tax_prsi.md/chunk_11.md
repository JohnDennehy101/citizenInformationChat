###  **Occupational pensions**

If you have an [ occupational pension
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/money-and-tax/personal-
finance/pensions/occupational-pensions/) you can either keep your benefits
within the scheme (known as a _preserved benefit_ ) or transfer the benefits
to another scheme.

A preserved benefit means that you get a pension when you reach the scheme's
normal retirement age.

When you leave your pension scheme, you must get a Leaving Service Options
letter within 2 months, outlining your benefit options.
