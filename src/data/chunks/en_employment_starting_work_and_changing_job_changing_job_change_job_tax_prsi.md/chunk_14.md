##  Register your new job

You only need to register your first job or private pension with the [ Jobs
and Pensions section of Revenueâ€™s myAccount
](https://www.revenue.ie/en/online-services/services/paye-services/add-job-
pension.aspx) .

If you change job, you no longer need to register your new job or pension.

All you need to do is give your employer your PPSN. Your employer is
responsible for registering second and subsequent jobs. Your employer can
register your job by either requesting a Revenue Payroll Notification (RPN) or
by making a payroll submission.

When Revenue gets this information they will send a Tax Credit Certificate
(TCC) to you and your new employer or pension provider. This ensures the
correct amount of tax is deducted from your job or private pension.
