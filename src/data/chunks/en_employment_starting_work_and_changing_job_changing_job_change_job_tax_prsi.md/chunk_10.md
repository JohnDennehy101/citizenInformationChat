##  Changing jobs and your pension

You only need to register your first job or private pension with the [ Jobs
and Pensions section of Revenue’s myAccount
](https://www.revenue.ie/en/online-services/services/paye-services/add-job-
pension.aspx) .

If you change job, you no longer need to register your new job or pension –
