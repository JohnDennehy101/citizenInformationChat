##  Further protection for alleged victims

If a person is prosecuted for these criminal offences, the alleged victim is
granted anonymity - this means that they cannot be named or identified.

Unless a court allows the publication of the identity of the alleged victim,
any person who names or publishes any information likely to identify the
alleged victim may also be prosecuted for a criminal offence.

If you are found guilty of the offence of identifying an alleged victim, you
can be sentenced to a class B fine or maximum prison term of 12 months or both
in the District Court. If you are found guilty of this offence in the Circuit
Court, you can be sentenced to an unlimited fine or a maximum prison term of 3
years or both.
