###  2\. No specific intent to cause harm

The second, less serious offence is recording, distributing or publishing an
intimate image without consent even if there was no specific intent to cause
harm. This offence would cover situations such as sharing intimate images of
someone you do not know.

For example, you may receive an intimate image of a person you do not know in
a social media message. If you republish that image without the permission of
the subject, you could be liable for prosecution under this offence, even if
you did not intend to cause harm to the person in the image.

If you are found guilty of this offence, you can be sentenced to a class A
fine or a maximum prison term of 12 months or both in the [ District Court
](/en/justice/courts-system/district-court/) .
