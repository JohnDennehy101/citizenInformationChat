##  Introduction

Since 9 February 2021, new laws apply to the sharing of intimate images
without the consent of the person in the images. If you record, distribute or
publish intimate images without the permission of the person featured in the
images (sometimes called the subject of the images), you are guilty of an
offence.

Depending on your intent in sharing the images, you can face a maximum prison
sentence of up to 7 years. Protections have been put in place to ensure that
the alleged victim is not further harmed or embarrassed during any
prosecution.
