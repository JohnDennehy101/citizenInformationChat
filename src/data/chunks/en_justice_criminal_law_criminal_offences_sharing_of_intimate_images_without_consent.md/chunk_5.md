###  1\. Intent to cause harm

The first, more serious offence is distributing, publishing or threatening to
distribute or publish an intimate image without consent and with the intent to
cause harm or being reckless as to whether harm is caused (knowing but not
necessarily intending for harm to be caused). This is sometimes known as
revenge porn.

If you are [ found guilty of this offence ](/en/justice/criminal-law/criminal-
trial/sentence/) , you can be sentenced to a [ class A fine
](/en/justice/criminal-law/criminal-trial/fines-for-criminal-offences/) or a [
maximum prison term ](/en/justice/criminal-law/criminal-trial/types-of-
sentences/) of 12 months or both in the [ District Court ](/en/justice/courts-
system/district-court/) . More serious versions of the offence can be
prosecuted in the [ Circuit Court ](/en/justice/courts-system/circuit-court/)
such as where a large number of intimate images are released or where the
intimate images are shared to a wide audience. If you are found guilty of this
offence in the Circuit Court, you can be sentenced to an unlimited fine or
maximum prison term of 7 years or both.
