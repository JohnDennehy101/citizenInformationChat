##  Introduction

Ireland has 31 local authorities that are responsible for a range of local
services, including:

  * Housing 
  * Roads 
  * Recreation and amenities 
  * Planning 
  * Libraries 
  * Environmental protection 
  * Fire services 
  * Register of electors 

Most (26) local authorities are county councils. There are also 3 city
councils (Dublin, Galway and Cork) and 2 councils that oversee a city and a
county (Limerick and Waterford).

Voters elect councillors to represent them at local level. You can read about
how members of local authorities are elected [ in a range of different
languages ](https://www.gov.ie/en/collection/6c483-information-on-how-members-
of-local-authorities-are-elected-in-a-range-of-different-languages/) .

Ireland currently has 949 elected councillors. They make policy decisions at
council meetings. Local councils are managed by a chief executive who oversees
the day-to-day running of the council.

Local authorities are recognised in Article 28A of the Constitution of
Ireland, which guarantees that [ local elections ](/en/government-in-
ireland/elections-and-referenda/types-of-elections-and-referendums/local-
elections/) are held at least every 5 years.
