###  Telling the RTB about changes to rent

If the amount of rent changes, the landlord must tell the RTB of the change
within one month. Read more in our document on [ rent increases
](/en/housing/renting-a-home/landlords-rights-and-responsibilities/rent-
increases-in-private-rented-housing/) .

The RTB can take action against landlords who do not notify the RTB about
changes in rent.
