##  Introduction

Landlords must register residential tenancies with the [ Residential Tenancies
Board (RTB) ](/en/housing/renting-a-home/resolving-disputes/residential-
tenancies-board/) every year and update the RTB if information about a tenancy
changes.

The RTB uses this information to keep a public [ register of tenancies
](https://www.rtb.ie/news/rtb-publishes-q1-2022-rent-index) . The register
shows the address of the property and the number of bedrooms. It does not show
the identity of the landlord or the tenants, or the amount of rent paid.

Since 4 April 2022, landlords have to register their tenancies annually.
Tenancies must be registered every year, within a month of the date of when
the tenancy began.

The [ Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2019
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2019/act/14/enacted/en/html) sets out the
requirement for tenancies to be registered annually.
