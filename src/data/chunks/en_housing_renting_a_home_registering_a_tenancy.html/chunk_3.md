##  What tenancies must be registered?

Under residential tenancies legislation, most privately rented properties must
be registered with the RTB. This includes properties rented out by [ approved
housing bodies ](/en/housing/local-authority-and-social-housing/approved-
housing-bodies/) and [ student-specific accommodation
](https://www.rtb.ie/registration-and-compliance/registrations/student-
specific-accommodation) .

Residential tenancies legislation **does not apply** to the following types of
rented property, so these tenancies do not need to be registered with the RTB:

  * Business lettings 
  * Holiday lettings 
  * Formerly rent-controlled properties or long-occupation lease tenancies â€“ separate legislation applies to them 
  * Owner-occupied accommodation (for example, if you [ rent a room in your landlord's home ](/en/housing/renting-a-home/tenants-rights-and-responsibilities/sharing-accommodation-with-your-landlord/) ) 
  * Properties where the spouse, parent or child of the landlord lives. This applies to informal family arrangements where there is no tenancy agreement in writing. However, the legislation does cover formal agreements between family members, for example, where a lease has been signed. 
  * [ Social housing ](/en/housing/local-authority-and-social-housing/applying-for-local-authority-housing/) provided by local authorities
