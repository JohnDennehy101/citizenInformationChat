###  Family reunification

Generally, non-EEA students coming to Ireland have no right to bring their
family with them. Spouses, partners and children of non-EEA nationals can
apply to enter and live in Ireland in their own right, but they cannot apply
on the basis of their relationship to a non-EEA student. There are some
exceptions to this rule, for example, for PhD students.
