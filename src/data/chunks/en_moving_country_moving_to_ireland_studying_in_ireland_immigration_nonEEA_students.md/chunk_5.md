###  English-language programmes

Eligible English-language courses are listed in the [ Interim List of Eligible
Programmes (ILEP) ](https://www.irishimmigration.ie/coming-to-study-in-
ireland/what-are-my-study-options/a-third-level-course-or-a-language-course/)
. Further education programmes and overseas-accredited vocational education
and training programmes are no longer listed as eligible courses and the
Internationalisation Register has ceased to exist.

The immigration permission to attend a 25-week English-language course is for
8 months. New students attending language courses may be granted permission
for a maximum of 3 language courses. This amounts to a total immigration
permission of 2 years (3 x 8 months).
