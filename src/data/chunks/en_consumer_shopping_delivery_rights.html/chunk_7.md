##  My goods are lost or arrived damaged

The seller is responsible for damage or loss of your goods from the time they
are dispatched until you receive them. This is the case where the seller has
offered a particular post, delivery or courier service and this was not
organised by you.

If you organised your own delivery service or nominated someone else to
receive the goods (for example, a neighbour), then the seller’s responsibility
for the goods ends once the person you nominated receives them.

If you are using a home delivery or proxy address service (for example An
Post’s AddressPal) then you have a separate contract for that service. The
seller’s liability ends once the goods are passed to this third party. In this
case, the third party has responsibility for your goods but there may be terms
and conditions in your contract that limit their liability for loss or damage.
