##  My goods are delayed

Your purchase must be delivered without undue delay and not later than 30 days
from the date the order was placed (unless you agreed to a different date).
This only applies to products bought from traders based within the EU.

If the seller does not deliver the goods within the time agreed, you can ask
for the goods to be delivered at a later, more convenient date. If the seller
fails to deliver within this additional period, you can cancel the contract
and get a refund of all the money you paid.

If you told the seller that delivery by a certain date was essential and the
seller agreed to this, you can cancel the contract and get a refund if they
fail to deliver within the agreed time. You can also cancel the contract and
get a refund if the seller tells you that they cannot or will not deliver the
goods.
