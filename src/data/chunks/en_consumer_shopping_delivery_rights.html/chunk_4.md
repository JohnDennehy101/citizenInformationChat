###  Delivery costs

The seller must give you information about the total cost of the order in a
clear and understandable way. This must include information about extra
unavoidable costs such as delivery or postal charges and arrangements for
delivery.

For products bought _at a distance_ (that is online, by phone or away from the
business premises), you must get this information by the time you get to the
payment stage, at the very latest. A seller cannot charge you extra without
your explicit agreement.

These requirements are set out under the [ Consumer Rights Act 2022 (pdf)
](https://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2022/act/37/enacted/en/pdf) . Read more
about [ your consumer rights ](/en/consumer/consumer-laws/your-consumer-
rights/) .

Pay attention to any other charges. For example, if you buy from a trader
based outside the EU, you may have to pay for Value Added Tax (VAT) and
customs. This may be collected on your doorstep by the company delivering the
product to you.
