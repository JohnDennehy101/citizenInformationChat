##  If I need more help

If you have a problem with delivery of something you have ordered, you should
first contact the seller, in writing if possible.

The European Consumer Centre (ECC) Ireland have a [ letter template
](https://www.eccireland.ie/letter/non-delivery/) which may be helpful.

If you cannot resolve the issue with the seller directly, you can:

  * Contact the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC) for information and advice 
  * Contact your bank or credit card provider to use chargeback. The CCPC has more information on [ chargeback ](https://www.ccpc.ie/consumers/money/credit-cards/disputed-card-transactions-chargeback/)
  * Take a claim against the seller using the [ Small Claims Procedure ](/en/justice/courts-system/small-claims-court/)
