###  Delivery restrictions

The seller must also tell you about any delivery restrictions that apply.

There may be restrictions on the locations that the seller delivers to. A
trader does not have to deliver to Ireland.

However, a seller cannot deny you access to their goods and services based on
your nationality or place of residence under the Geo-blocking Regulation. This
means that you have a right to order the goods and collect them at the
traderâ€™s premises, or have them delivered to an address or pick up point,
where the trader offers these options to local customers.

You can find examples from the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission
(CCPC) on [ how the Geo-blocking Regulations apply (pdf)
](https://www.ccpc.ie/business/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/12/Geo-
blocking-Guide.pdf) .
