##  Introduction

You have a right to privacy at work. However, this right must be balanced with
your employer's need to run and protect their business.

Your employer wants to protect their business, reputation, resources, and
equipment. To do this, they may want to monitor how you use email, internet,
and phones, or use security cameras (CCTV) in your workplace.

When your employer collects, uses or stores information about you they must
comply with the [ General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/government-in-ireland/data-
protection/overview-of-general-data-protection-regulation/) and the [ Irish
Data Protection Act 2018 ](https://www.oireachtas.ie/en/bills/bill/2018/10/) .

This page explains the rules employers must follow when monitoring you in the
workplace. You can also read the general [ rules for data protection in the
workplace ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/employment/employment-
rights-and-conditions/data-protection-at-work/data-protection-in-the-
workplace/) .
