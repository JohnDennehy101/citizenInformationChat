##  Using CCTV in the workplace

If your workplace has CCTV, there must be clear signs indicating where the
cameras are placed. The signs should be easy to read, well-lit and located in
visible areas. They should also give contact information for discussing the
handling of your data. For example, the owner of the premises or the security
company operating the CCTV system.

Your employer must clearly state why they are using CCTV if it is not obvious.
For example, placing a camera at the entrance to detect intruders is obvious.
However, monitoring your behaviour or performance using CCTV is not obvious.
In such cases, your employer must tell you before recording for these reasons.
Similarly, if CCTV is installed for health and safety reasons, this should be
clearly communicated to everyone in the workplace.

Your employer should have a written CCTV policy that includes:

  * The identity of the company holding the CCTV footage 
  * The reasons for using CCTV footage 
  * Any third parties the footage may be shared with 
  * How you can request to see the footage of yourself 
  * How long the footage will be held for 
  * How the footage will be secured
