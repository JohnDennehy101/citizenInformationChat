##  Monitoring you without you knowing

Generally, it is against the law to collect someone’s data or monitor them
without them knowing, called _covert surveillance_ . This is only allowed in
exceptional circumstances where the data is used to detect, prevent, or
investigate crime, or to prosecute offenders.

Covert surveillance can only take place if you or your workplace are relevant
to a criminal investigation. It must be focused and for a short period. If no
evidence is found within a reasonable time, the employer should stop covert
surveillance.

A specific written policy must be put in place to allow for covert
surveillance. This policy must explain:

  * The reason and justification for covert surveillance 
  * Procedures, measures, and safeguards during ongoing surveillance 
  * The goal of involving An Garda Síochána or other prosecution authorities to investigate alleged criminal offences
