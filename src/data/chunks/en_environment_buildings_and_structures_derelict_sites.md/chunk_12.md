###  Fines

Fines are payable to the local authority for non-compliance with statutory
notices about derelict sites, and for failing to carry out work required by
the local authority. The rates of fine were set in the [ Derelict Sites Act
1990 ](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1990/en/act/pub/0014/index.html) and
have been increased in accordance with the [ Fines Act 2010
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2010/en/act/pub/0008/index.html) . Read [
