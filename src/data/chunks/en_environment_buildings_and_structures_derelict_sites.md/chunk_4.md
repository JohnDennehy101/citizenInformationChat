###  Derelict Sites Register

Each local authority must keep a register of all derelict sites in its area,
containing the:

  * Location of each derelict site 
  * Name and address of the owner [ ](https://www.valuationtribunal.ie/making-an-appeal/making-derelict-site-appeal/)
  * Details of any action the local authority has taken 
  * Current market value of each site carried out by the local authority or by an authorised person. (The local authority enters details of the valuation into the register and serves a notice on the site’s owner – see ‘Statutory notices’ below). 

If the property is owned or occupied by a local authority itself, the register
must contain details of what it’s currently being used for and what the local
authority plans to do with it.

If you are the owner, you can appeal the valuation to the Valuation Tribunal.
To appeal you [ fill in a Derelict Site Appeal online
](https://www.valuationtribunal.ie/appeal-type/derelict-site-appeal/) within
28 days of receiving the notice and pay a fee.
