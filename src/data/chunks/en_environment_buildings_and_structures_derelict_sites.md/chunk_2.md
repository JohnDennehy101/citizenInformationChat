##  Introduction

Under the [ Derelict Sites Act 1990
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1990/en/act/pub/0014/index.html) , local
authorities are responsible for dealing with derelict sites in their area.
They can use certain powers to enforce the clean-up of these sites.

Under the Act, local authorities can:

  * Prosecute owners who do not comply with notices served 
  * Make compulsory land purchases 
  * Carry out necessary work themselves and charge the owners for the cost 

All local authorities must:

  * Maintain a derelict sites register 
  * Make the register available for public inspection - It can remove an entry from the Register when it is satisfied that improvement works have been carried out on the derelict site.
