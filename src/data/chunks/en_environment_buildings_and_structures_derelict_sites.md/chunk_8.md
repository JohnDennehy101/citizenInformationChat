###  Compensation

If you have a right to or interest in land that has been acquired by a local
authority by compulsory purchase, you can apply for compensation (within 12
months of the vesting). The local authority will then pay you an amount of
compensation equal to the value (if any) of the land. This value will be
negotiated under the [ Acquisition of Land (Assessment of Compensation) Act
1919 ](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1919/en/act/pub/0057/print.html) . If
there is any money due to the local authority on the property (in the form of
a derelict sites levy or a court order for payment), the local authority can
subtract this from the compensation. If the amount that you owe on the
property is more than the agreed compensation, no compensation will be paid.
