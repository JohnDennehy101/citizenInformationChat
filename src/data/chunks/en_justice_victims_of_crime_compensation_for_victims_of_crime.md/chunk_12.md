##  How much compensation will I get?

The Scheme only covers financial losses, such as lost earnings and vouched

damaged at the same time and by the same offender who caused or inflicted the
injury which is the subject of your claim.

When deciding the amount of the award involving loss of earnings, the Tribunal
will consider any social welfare payments, agriculture payments, salary or
wages you received while on sick leave from work. The Tribunal will also take
