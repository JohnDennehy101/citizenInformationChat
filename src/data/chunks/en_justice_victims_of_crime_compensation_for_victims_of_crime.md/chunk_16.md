###  4\. Death of the victim not due to the criminal injury

If the victim died of causes unrelated to the criminal injury, compensation
will not be provided by the Tribunal in respect of loss of earnings, expenses
and liabilities incurred before the death unless the Tribunal considers that
this would otherwise cause hardship to the victimâ€™s dependents.
