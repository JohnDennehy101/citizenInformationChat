###  Consideration of your claim

Under the Scheme, a decision on your claim is made, in the first instance, by
the Tribunal based on the submitted documents and does not require you to
attend a hearing. The procedure for considering your claim varies depending on
the amount of money involved.

For cases worth:

  * Less than €3,000, a decision may be made by a duly authorised officer of the Tribunal. The Tribunal may appoint one of their staff members as a duly authorised officer. 
  * More than €3,000, the application must be submitted for decision to a Tribunal Member. A Tribunal Member is a qualified barrister or solicitor appointed by the Minister for Justice to undertake duties relating to the Tribunal on a part-time basis. 
  * Less than €75,000, the application will be decided by a single Tribunal Member. 
  * More than €75,000, the application will be decided collectively by three Tribunal Members. 

You are notified by the secretariat of the decision when it is made available.
You can accept or appeal the decision.
