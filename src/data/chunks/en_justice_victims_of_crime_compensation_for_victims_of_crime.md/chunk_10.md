###  Appealing the decision of the Tribunal

In the event you appeal the Tribunalâ€™s original decision, you will be invited
to an appeal hearing with a panel of 3 Tribunal members. The panel cannot
include a Tribunal member who made the original decision.

The application is considered afresh without reference to the original
decision. The panel hear the case orally and make a final decision on the
claim.

The appeal hearing will be held in private and in an informal manner so legal
representation is not required. The Scheme makes no provision for awarding
legal costs; therefore, the Tribunal cannot make any award in respect of costs
you incur in soliciting legal representation.

The hearing may be conducted remotely by teleconference or web-based video
conference. However, it may, in certain circumstances, be held onsite.

The decision of the Tribunal Appeal Hearing is considered to be final and
cannot be appealed.
