###  Who gets selected for Back for Business?

There are 50 spaces on the current Back for Business programme.

To be selected, you must meet the criteria above and show that you are
prepared to fully engage with the scheme over 6 months and determined to
develop your early stage business.

You do not need to do an interview or pitch to be selected. People who have
already returned to Ireland will be prioritised for selection.

The Lead Entrepreneurs will select the successful participants, and you will
be notified shortly afterwards.
