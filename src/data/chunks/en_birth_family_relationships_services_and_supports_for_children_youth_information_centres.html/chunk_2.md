##  What is a Youth InformationCentre?

Youth Information Centres and Services offer free and confidential information
on issues that matter to young people (up to 25 years) and those acting on
their behalf.

Some of the common things young people ask about are:

  * College courses, apprenticeships and other types of education 
  * Grants, bursaries, scholarships and financial supports for education 
  * Writing a CV, getting a job and starting a career 
  * Finding somewhere to live 
  * Your rights and entitlements 
  * Sport and leisure activities 
  * European opportunities to work, study and volunteer for young people 
  * Drug and alcohol awareness 
  * Health, wellbeing and healthy relationships
