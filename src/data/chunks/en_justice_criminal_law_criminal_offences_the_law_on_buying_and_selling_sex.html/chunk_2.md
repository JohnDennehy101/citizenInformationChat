##  Introduction

Selling sexual services is legal in Ireland.

However, it is against the law:

  * To buy or offer to buy sexual services 
  * To sell or offer sexual services on behalf of any person other than yourself on a street or other public place 
  * Not to move if asked by a garda who suspects that you are loitering in a public place for the purposes of prostitution by any person other than yourself 
  * To operate a brothel or allow a brothel to be operated in premises that you own or lease 
  * To control or direct the activities of person who provides sexual services and profit from doing so 
  * To compel or coerce someone to sell sexual services and profit from doing so 

The [ Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 2017
](https://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2017/act/2/enacted/en/html) made
important changes to the law on prostitution. It made paying for sexual
services a criminal offence. Previously, paying for sexual services was only
criminal if the person selling sex was either a victim of trafficking or a
minor. It also removed some of the criminal offences that were in place for
selling sexual services.

If you consider yourself or somebody else to be a victim of [ human
trafficking ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/justice/crime-and-crime-
prevention/human-trafficking/) , you should [ report your concerns
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/justice/law-enforcement/reporting-a-
crime/) to the [ Garda Síochána
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/justice/law-enforcement/garda-
siochana-national-police-force/) (Irish police force). In an emergency, you
should call 999 or 112.
