##  Information

Early retirement usually means retirement before the age of 65.

Early retirement may happen because you have to retire from your job at a
certain age, because you choose to take early retirement or because you have
been let go. Sometimes people who are described as taking early retirement
have actually been made redundant. Others who have been obliged to take early
retirement may regard themselves as [ unemployed
](/en/employment/unemployment-and-redundancy/losing-your-job/) and there are [
special provisions for older jobseekers ](/en/social-welfare/unemployed-
people/older-jobseekers/) .

This document outlines your entitlements to social welfare benefits if you
retire early and what arrangements you should make to keep your entitlement to
a state pension.

If you are made redundant, you may get a statutory redundancy lump sum. If you
retire early, for whatever reason, you may be entitled to Jobseeker's Benefit
and later to Jobseeker's Allowance. You may also be eligible for a range of
back to work and back to education schemes.

If you do retire early you should organise to continue your PRSI contributions
so that your entitlement to an State Pension (Contributory) is maintained (see
'Credits' below).
