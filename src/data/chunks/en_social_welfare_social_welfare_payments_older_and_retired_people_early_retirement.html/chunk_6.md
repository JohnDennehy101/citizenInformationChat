####  Jobseeker's Benefit (JB)

To qualify for [ Jobseeker's Benefit (JB) ](/en/social-welfare/unemployed-
people/jobseekers-benefit/) , you must, among other things, be unemployed,
aged under 66, capable of work, available for work and genuinely seeking work.
You can do a certain amount of work and continue to get some Jobseeker's
Benefit. You should check with the Department of Social Protection before
taking up work to see exactly what the effect will be.

If you are aged under 55 and you have received a redundancy payment of more
than â‚¬50,000, you may be disqualified from JB for 9 weeks.

If you have left work voluntarily, for example, if you have chosen early
retirement, you may not get JB for 9 weeks after leaving work. After that, you
may have a problem proving that you are available for and genuinely seeking
work. However, if you retire at 65, you may qualify for a [ new benefit
payment until you reach 66 ](/en/social-welfare/older-and-retired-
people/payment-for-people-retired-at-65/) .

As a general rule, JB is payable for either 9 months or 6 months. However, if
you are aged between 65 and 66 when your JB would normally end, you can
continue to get it until the age of 66, provided you meet the PRSI
requirements. Find out more about [ qualifying for a payment at 65
