###  Personal loans, credit cards and overdrafts

You are only responsible for those debts that you yourself have signed for. If
you are having difficulty making repayments on a loan in your own name or in
joint names, you should let the company know what has happened and ask for
time to work out what you can afford, given your changed circumstances.

Repayments on a loan **in the sole name** of your loved one should be paid out
of the estate. If you are asked to take over payments on a loan that is in the
sole name of your loved one, you do not have to do this. Get advice if you are
not sure what to do. [ MABS ](https://www.mabs.ie/en/) provide free,

Credit cards, bank overdrafts and personal loans are known as ‘unsecured
debts’. With unsecured debt, the creditor (the institution that is owed) does
not have the right to take a particular item of property if the debtor does
not pay. These debts are repaid from the estate. You only have to repay debts
yourself if they were taken out in joint names.

If there is not enough money in the estate to repay unsecured debts that were
taken out solely by the person who has died, and the debts are not covered by
an insurance policy, the creditor cannot ask anyone else to repay the debt.
