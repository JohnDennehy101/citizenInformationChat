##  The deceased person’s estate

When a person dies, their property, known as their estate, passes to their
personal representative. The personal representative then has the duty to
distribute the [ deceased person’s money and property ](/en/death/the-
deceaseds-estate/what-happens-the-deceaseds-estate/) in accordance with the
will (if there is a will) or the [ laws of succession ](/en/death/the-
deceaseds-estate/what-happens-the-deceaseds-estate#lc8139) if there is no
will.

If your deceased spouse or civil partner made a will, you have an automatic
right to a share in the estate which is called a ‘ [ legal right share
](/en/birth-family-relationships/married-couples/marital-status-and-
inheritance#l681ca) ’. If you are separated your inheritance rights may have
been renounced or extinguished. If you are divorced from the person who died,
or your civil partnership was dissolved, you [ no longer automatically inherit
](/en/birth-family-relationships/separation-and-divorce/succession/) from the
estate.

Cohabiting couples in Ireland have no automatic right of inheritance on the
death of either partner, but you can apply to the courts for [ provision to be
made for you from the estate. ](/en/birth-family-relationships/cohabiting-
couples/inheritance-rights-cohabiting-couples/)
