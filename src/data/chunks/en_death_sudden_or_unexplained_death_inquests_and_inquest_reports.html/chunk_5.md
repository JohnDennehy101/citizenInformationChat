###  What happens if the Garda√≠ make criminal charges?

A senior Garda can ask the Coroner to adjourn (put on hold) the inquest if
criminal charges are being considered or have already been made.

After the criminal charges have been determined, the Coroner may choose to
resume the inquest if the Coroner thinks there are special reasons for doing
so.
