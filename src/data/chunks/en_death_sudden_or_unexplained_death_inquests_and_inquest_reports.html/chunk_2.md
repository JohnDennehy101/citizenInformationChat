##  Introduction

An inquest is an official, public enquiry, led by a [ coroner
](/en/death/sudden-or-unexplained-death/coroners/) (and in some cases
involving a [ jury ](/en/justice/courtroom/jury-service/) ) into the
circumstances of a sudden, unexplained or violent death. The coroner, or a
jury, can make findings on:

  * The identity of the deceased person 
  * How, when and where the death occurred 
  * The circumstances surrounding the death 

The family of the deceased person is entitled to attend the inquest, but they
are not legally obliged to be there. If the family attend the inquest, they do
not need legal representation. Sometimes however, if legal action is being
taken as a result of the death, the family may engage a solicitor to attend
the inquest and take appropriate notes.

An inquest is not usually held if a [ post-mortem examination
](/en/death/sudden-or-unexplained-death/postmortems/) of the body can explain
the cause of death.
