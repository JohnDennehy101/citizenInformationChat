###  Official reports of inquests

As inquests are public enquiries, it is possible to obtain a copy of the post-
mortem report and any depositions taken at the inquest, including a copy of
the verdict. These official reports are only available after the inquest has
concluded. There is a small fee for these documents. Inquest papers are not
available before the inquest has been held.
