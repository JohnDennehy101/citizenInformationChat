##  When is a jury required?

In some circumstances a jury must be present at an inquest. Every citizen over
18 years of age living within a coroner's district is liable to serve on the
jury unless they are exempt. The inquest jury is made up of 6-12 people. A
jury is required at an inquest where:

  * The death is due to murder, manslaughter or infanticide (when a mother kills her child when the child is less than 12 months old) 
  * The death took place in prison 
  * The death was caused by an accident, poisoning or a disease requiring notification to a government department or inspector 
  * The death occurred in circumstances, which if they continued or happened again would put member(s) of the public in danger 
  * The Coroner considers that a jury is necessary 

To attend as a juror at an inquest, you will receive a summons served from a
member of An Garda Síochána. This summons can be served by delivering it to
you directly or by sending to you by registered post. Alternatively the
summons can be delivered to a person over 16 years old who lives in your
residence. Failure to attend jury service without a reasonable excuse is an
offence and you will face penalties.

If the jury as a whole at the inquest cannot agree on its verdict, the [
Coroner ](/en/death/sudden-or-unexplained-death/coroners/) must accept a
majority decision from the jury. If there is no majority verdict, the Coroner
must discharge the jury and hold a new inquest.
