##  How do inquests work?

When a person dies and the death is sudden, unnatural, violent or unexplained,
the death must be [ reported to the Coroner ](/en/death/sudden-or-unexplained-
death/coroners/) . The Coroner can arrange for a post-mortem examination of
the body, if one has not already been arranged or carried out.

If the [ post-mortem examination ](/en/death/sudden-or-unexplained-
death/postmortems/) shows that death was due to natural causes there is no
need for an inquest. The Coroner can issue a Coroner's Certificate to the
Registrar of Births and Deaths who will then [ register the death
](/en/death/practical-arrangements-after-a-death/registering-a-death/) and
issue the death certificate. If the cause of death is unnatural, or other
issues surrounding the death are unknown, the Coroner carries out an inquest.
If more than one person died in the same incident, the Minister for Justice
may decide that only one inquest is needed, and can ask the Coroner in one
district to take charge of the inquest for the deceased people who may have
lived in other districts.

The Minister can also direct an inquest where the remains of the deceased
person have been destroyed or [ cannot be recovered ](/en/death/sudden-or-
unexplained-death/missing-presumed-dead/) .
