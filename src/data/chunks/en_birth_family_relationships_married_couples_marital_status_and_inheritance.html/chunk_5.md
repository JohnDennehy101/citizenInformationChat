###  Getting your legal right share

If there is a [ will and an executor ](/en/death/the-deceaseds-estate/dealing-
with-the-deceaseds-estate/) has been appointed, then the executor deals with
the estate. The executor must make sure that you (the spouse/civil partner)
are aware of your right to a legal right share and they must distribute the
estate in accordance with the will and the law. You should not have to go to
court to get this share. Read about [ Making a will in Ireland
](/en/death/before-a-death/making-a-will/) .

If your spouse or civil partner left a gift to you in their will, you can
choose to accept the gift instead of your legal right share. Alternatively,
you can insist on your legal right share (and the specific gift as part of
that legal right share, if it is of less value that the legal right share).

Your spouseâ€™s executor must tell you in writing of your right to choose
between these 2 options. You must ask for your legal right share within 6
months of being notified, or within 12 months of the taking out of the Grant
of Representation.

**Deed of variation**

A deed of variation (also known as a deed of family arrangement) is a legal
document that allows beneficiaries to rearrange or vary the entitlements due
to them. For example, the beneficiaries may decide that all or part of their
entitlement should be redistributed to their children (the next generation),
siblings, friends or charity. It is important to get legal and financial
advice before deciding to use a deed of variation as there may be tax
implications for you and the person receiving the benefit.
