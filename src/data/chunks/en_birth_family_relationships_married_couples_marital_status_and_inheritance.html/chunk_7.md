###  Informal separation

If you and your spouse were living apart, but you did not have a formal [
separation agreement ](/en/birth-family-relationships/separation-and-
divorce/judicial-separation/) or [ divorce ](/en/birth-family-
relationships/separation-and-divorce/divorce-decrees/) , you continue to be
spouses in the eyes of the law. This means that you are still entitled to the
appropriate share of your deceased spouseâ€™s estate (possessions).
