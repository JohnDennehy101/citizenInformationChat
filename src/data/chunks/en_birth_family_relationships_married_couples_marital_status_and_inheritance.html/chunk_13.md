###  If you (the child) have not been adequately provided for

If a child (either minor or adult) believes they have not been adequately
provided for in their parentâ€™s will, they can make an application to the
court. The court will decide if the parent has "failed in his moral duty to
make proper provision for the child in accordance with his means".

Each case is decided on its merits and the court looks at the situation from
the point of view of a "prudent and just" parent. Anyone considering
challenging a will on these grounds should get legal opinion before applying
to the court.
