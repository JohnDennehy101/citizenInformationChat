##  Eye-witnesses

You can be called as an eye-witness if you saw something happen that is
relevant to the case. In criminal and civil cases, you can be called by either
side in the case.

[ When you take the stand ](/en/justice/witnesses/being-a-witness/) , you must
take an oath or affirmation that you will "tell the truth, the whole truth and
nothing but the truth". You will then be asked a series of questions, which
will let you describe what you witnessed.

Your evidence as an "eye-witness" must be about the facts, that is, what you
actually saw, rather than any assumptions you have made from what you saw. You
will then be cross-examined by the other side.
