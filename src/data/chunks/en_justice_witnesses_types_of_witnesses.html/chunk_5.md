##  Character witnesses

You can be called as a character witness in certain situations, including:

  * To give evidence about the good character of the accused in a criminal case. You will take the oath or affirmation and you will then be asked a series of questions that allow you to describe the accused. The purpose of your evidence is to show that the accused is less likely to have committed the offence because they are a person of good character. 
  * To give evidence about the good character of a person who has already been convicted of a criminal offence. The purpose of your evidence is to help the judge decide which [ sentence ](/en/justice/criminal-law/criminal-trial/sentence/) to impose. 
  * To give evidence about the good or bad character of a person in a civil trial if that person's character is an important issue in the case. For example, in a [ defamation ](/en/justice/civil-law/law-on-defamation/) case if a newspaper stated that someone was a liar, you may be called to give evidence about an incident you saw that shows that the person in question was dishonest. 

You will take the oath or affirmation and then you will be asked a series of
questions that allow you describe what you know of the personâ€™s character. You
will then be cross-examined by the other side.
