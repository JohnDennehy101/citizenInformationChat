###  Subsequent applications

If your application for international protection and your appeal are both
refused and something has changed that makes it more likely that you would now
qualify for international protection, you can apply to the Minister for
Justice to make a _subsequent application_ . If the Minister refuses
permission, you can appeal that decision to IPAT.
