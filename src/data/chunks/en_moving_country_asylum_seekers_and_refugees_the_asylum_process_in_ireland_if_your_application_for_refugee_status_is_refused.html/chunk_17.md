##  Oral hearings

You can request an oral hearing of your appeal against a recommendation that
you should not be declared a refugee, or that you should not be granted
subsidiary protection.

IPAT must hold an oral hearing if you ask for one. If you do not ask for an
oral hearing, IPAT will decide if an oral hearing is needed. The oral hearing
may be in person at the IPAT office in Dublin, or may be held remotely
(online).

At an oral hearing, a member of IPAT will listen to your case. They will also
listen to an officer from the Minister for Justice (called the ‘presenting
officer’) who will explain the decision that you are appealing.

You can ask for an interpreter to be there to help you understand. You should
consider having an interpreter if English is not your first language, even if
you speak English well. Both you and the presenting officer can call
witnesses. If you want to have witnesses present, you must request this when
you are making your appeal application.

Your legal representative will help you to present your case by asking you
questions. The presenting officer will also ask you questions. The IPAT member
may also ask questions to make sure that you have presented your case fully.
Oral hearings usually last about 2 hours.

You must attend your oral hearing. If you cannot attend, you must write to
IPAT to explain the reason. If you do not do this, your appeal could be
withdrawn.
