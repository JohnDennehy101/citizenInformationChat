###  No oral hearing

For recommendations that you should not be declared a refugee or that you
should be granted neither refugee or subsidiary protection status, IPAT may
only decide on your appeal without an oral hearing if:

  * The recommendation you are appealing comes under the accelerated appeals procedure, and IPAT decides that it is not in the interest of justice to hold an oral hearing 
  * You have not requested an oral hearing and IPAT has decided not to hold one 
  * You have withdrawn your request for an oral hearing and IPAT has decided not to hold one
