###  Permission to remain decisions

If you get [ permission to remain ](/en/moving-country/asylum-seekers-and-
refugees/refugee-status-and-leave-to-remain/permission-to-remain/) , you can
choose to withdraw your appeal against the refusal to declare you a refugee or
grant you subsidiary protection. You do not have to withdraw your appeal.

You cannot appeal a refusal of your permission to remain application. But if
your international protection appeal is refused, and you had already been
refused permission to remain, you will get a Permission to Remain Review Form
to complete. You can use this form to tell the Minister about any changes in
your circumstances since the Minister refused to grant you permission to
remain.
