###  Withdrawing your application or having it withdrawn

You could decide to [ withdraw your application ](/en/moving-country/asylum-
seekers-and-refugees/the-asylum-process-in-ireland/withdrawing-from-the-
asylum-process-in-ireland/) yourself for international protection for your own
reasons. Or your application could be withdrawn because you did not comply
with your legal duties during the application (for example, you did not tell
the IPO that you changed your address).

If your application is withdrawn, you cannot appeal this decision to IPAT. You
can make an application to the High Court for a [ judicial review
](/en/government-in-ireland/how-government-works/standards-and-
accountability/judicial-review-public-decisions/) of how the decision was
made.
