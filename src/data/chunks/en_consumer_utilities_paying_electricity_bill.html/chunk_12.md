##  Getting a meter reading

Your electricity meter measures the amount of electricity you use. The
readings are used by your supplier to calculate your bill.

An ESBN reader will call to your property to record the amount of electricity
used since the meter was last read. This is done 4 times a year. An estimated
reading will be used for the other billing periods.

If the meter reader cannot get access to the meter, they will leave a card in
the mailbox letting you know they were there and asking you to send in your
own reading. You can also send your meter reading directly to your supplier.
If you do not submit a reading, an estimated reading will be used to calculate
your next bill.

Meters are the property of ESBN and you must not interfere with it in any way.
Only authorised people are allowed to fix, connect, remove or carry out work
on any meter, main fuse box, seal, electric line or other apparatus belonging
to ESBN. It is against the law to tamper with your meter. Find out more about
