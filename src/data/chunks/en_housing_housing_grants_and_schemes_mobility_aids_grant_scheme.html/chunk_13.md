##  Other grants and schemes

If you need to adapt your home more extensively, or if you do not qualify
under the means test, you can apply for the [ Housing Adaptation Grant for
People with a Disability ](/en/housing/housing-grants-and-schemes/housing-
supports-for-older-people-and-people-with-disabilities/housing-adaptation-
grant-for-people-with-disability/) instead.

If you are an older person and you need essential repairs to your home, the [
Housing Aid for Older Persons Scheme ](/en/housing/housing-grants-and-
schemes/housing-supports-for-older-people-and-people-with-
disabilities/housing-aid-for-older-people-grant/) may be more suitable for
you.

These schemes along with the Mobility Aid Grant are administered by the local
authorities. The rules of the scheme are set-out in the [ Housing (Adaptation
Grants for Older People and People With A Disability), Regulations 2007
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2007/en/si/0670.html) , as amended by the [
2014 Regulations
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2014/si/104/made/en/print) .

You apply for the 3 grants using the same [ application form
](https://assets.gov.ie/119595/fb68af61-2429-414e-8f61-95ddc380f8ec.pdf) .
