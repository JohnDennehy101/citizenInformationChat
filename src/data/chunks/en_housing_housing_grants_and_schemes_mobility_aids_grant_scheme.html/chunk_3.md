###  **What work is covered by the grant?**

The grant can be used to make basic changes to your home so it is more
accessible, like adding:

  * Grab rails 
  * An accessible shower 
  * Ramps 
  * A stair-lift 
  * A fixed track hoist. (This is a ceiling or wall-mounted track with a sling attached to it, which means you can be mechanically lifted and moved to different places along the track). 

The grant does not cover VAT on the work. However, you can apply to Revenue
for a [ VAT refund ](/en/money-and-tax/tax/tax-credits-and-reliefs-for-people-
with-disabilities/vat-refunds-on-aids-and-appliances-used-by-people-with-
disabilities/) for any appliances that you need and the cost of installing
them.
