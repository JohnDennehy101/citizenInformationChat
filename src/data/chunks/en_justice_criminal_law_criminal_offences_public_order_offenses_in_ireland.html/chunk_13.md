##  Entering a building with intent to commit an offence

It is an offence to enter a building or the vicinity of a building with the
intention of committing an offence or interfering with property.

Under the definition of this offence, it is enough to be on the property, for
example, in the back garden or the driveway of a house. But, in any
proceedings against the accused, it is up to the prosecution to prove that the
accused was there with the intention of committing an offence or interfering
with property.

If you are found guilty of this offence you will be liable on summary
conviction to a class C fine, or to a maximum term in prison of 6 months, or
both.
