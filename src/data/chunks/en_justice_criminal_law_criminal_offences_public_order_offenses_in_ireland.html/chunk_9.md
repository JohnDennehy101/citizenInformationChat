###  Affray

Affray is when 2 or more people use or threaten to use unlawful violence
towards each other, and their conduct would cause someone of reasonable
firmness who was present at that place to fear for their or someone elseâ€™s
safety.

The violence involved in affray must be between the 2 or more people involved
and not directed towards innocent by-standers. For example, affray would be
where a group of people are fighting against each other in the street. Affray
can take place in a public or private place.

The offence of affray is only committed when actual unlawful violence is used.
Threats alone do not constitute the offence of affray. If you are convicted of
affray, you can receive a maximum penalty of an unlimited fine, or up to 5
years in prison, or both.
