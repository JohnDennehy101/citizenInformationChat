###  Blackmail, extortion and demanding money with menaces

It is an offence for a person to make unwarranted demands with menaces to make
personal gains for themselves or another, or with the intention to cause a
loss to another.

The exception to this offence is if the person making the demand with menaces
believes that:

  * They have reasonable grounds for making the demand, and 
  * The use of menaces is a proper means of reinforcing the demand 

While there is no definition in the Act of “menaces”, the courts held that:

“The word menace is to be liberally construed, and not limited to threats of
violence but should include threats of any action detrimental to or unpleasant
to the person addressed”.

If you are convicted of this offence, the maximum punishment is an unlimited
fine, or up to 14 years in prison, or both.
