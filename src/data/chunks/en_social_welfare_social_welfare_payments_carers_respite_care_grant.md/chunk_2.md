##  What is the Carer's Support Grant?

The Carer’s Support Grant is paid to carers once a year by the Department of
Social Protection (DSP). It used to be called the Respite Care Grant.

You can use the grant in whatever way you like. You can use it to pay for
respite care, but you don't have to. Read our page about [ breaks and respite
care for carers ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/health/health-
services/health-services-for-people-with-disabilities/respite-care/) .

In June of each year (usually on the first Thursday of the month), the DSP
pays the grant automatically to carers getting:

  * [ Carer's Allowance ](/en/social-welfare/carers/carers-allowance/)
  * [ Carer's Benefit ](/en/social-welfare/carers/carers-benefit/)
  * [ Domiciliary Care Allowance ](/en/social-welfare/disability-and-illness/domiciliary-care-allowance/)

Only one Carer’s Support Grant can be paid for each person getting care.

The Carer’s Support Grant was paid on 6 June 2024.
