##  What is a psychological assessment?

A psychological assessment can help find out if your child has special needs
at school.

The school will involve a psychologist only after they have considered the
child’s needs.

If your child has learning, emotional or behavioural difficulties, the school
your child attends is responsible for getting an assessment of your child’s
needs. The assessment will help the school to plan your child’s education and
remedial intervention.

You can read about the process schools use to consider the [ special education
needs of a child ](https://www.gov.ie/en/service/5ef45c-neps/) .

**Pilot counselling programme in primary schools**

The Department of Education has set up a [ pilot counselling programme to a
small number of primary schools in 7 counties
](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/61be8-counselling-in-primary-schools-
pilot-cps-p-2023-2025/) . The counselling service provided under the pilot
programme is not a substitute for the HSE Primary Care Psychology service or
CAMHS. It does not replace NEPS within a school. School staff with the support
of NEPS can refer children to the service for up to 6 counselling sessions.
This will be done in consultation and with the consent of parents, but parents
cannot refer their child directly to the programme. There is more [
