##  Protection of your child's interests

Psychological assessment services are in place so that children with special
learning needs can take advantage of the necessary resources. However, some
children will be nervous at the thought of meeting a psychologist. If a child
is aware that they have difficulties at school, the prospect of a meeting with
a psychologist may confirm to them a perceived weakness. For this reason, a
school should only commission an individual assessment if, having spoken with
the child's parents, it is absolutely convinced that the result will benefit
the child.

NEPS provides [ advice on whether you should tell your child
](https://www.gov.ie/en/service/5ef45c-neps/#information-for-parents) that
their learning needs will be assessed by a psychologist.

For the protection of your child's confidentiality, they are referred to by
their initials only in all documentation submitted by school authorities to
NEPS.

All psychologists on the NEPS panel must have obtained Garda clearance. It is
also recommended that a member of the school staff look in on the assessment
interview once or twice.

In general, an assessment should be carried out in your child's school, where
the surroundings are familiar. A separate room in the main building and near
the school office is an ideal venue.
