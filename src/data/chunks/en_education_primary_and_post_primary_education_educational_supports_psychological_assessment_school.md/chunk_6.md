###  What is the Scheme for Commissioning Psychological Assessments (SCPA)

If your school is not located in a region with a NEPS service, they can use
the Scheme for Commissioning Psychological Assessment (SCPA).

The SCPA helps schools to meet the urgent need for psychological advice while
the NEPS service is being expanded to all schools. Only psychologists named in
the current list are eligible to carry out work under the SCPA scheme. You can
