##  What counts as a ‘homemaking year'?

A ‘homemaking year’ is any year in which you are out of the workforce for the
full tax year. Only a full year can be disregarded.

The Department of Social Protection (DSP) can disregard up to 20 homemaking
years when calculating your State Pension (Contributory).
