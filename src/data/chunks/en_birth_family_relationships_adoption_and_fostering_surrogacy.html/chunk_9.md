##  Getting legal guardianship and custody of your child

If the _commissioning father_ is the genetic or biological father of the
child, he can apply for [ guardianship of the child ](/en/birth-family-
relationships/cohabiting-couples/guardianship-and-cohabiting-couples/) under
the Guardianship of Infants Act 1964.

However, **his partner does not** have an immediate right to make such an
application (even if she is the child’s biological mother). Instead, if the
couple is married or in a civil partnership, the partner must **wait 2 years
before seeking guardianship or custody rights** . These 2 years will show the
court that the parent had day-to-day responsibility for the child’s care.

If the couple are _cohabitating_ (living together but not married or in a
civil partnership), the partner must **wait 3 years** before applying for
guardianship or custody.

This has no impact on the surrogate mother’s status as the child’s legal
mother and guardian.
