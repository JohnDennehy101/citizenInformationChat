##  Surrogacy arrangements abroad

Some couples choose to go abroad to use a surrogate. If you enter into a
surrogacy arrangement abroad, you will need to prepare for issues such as
citizenship and travel documents for the child.

Normally, DNA testing to prove the genetic parentage is necessary before the
child can be taken to Ireland by a person other than the surrogate mother. You
can read [ advice on citizenship, parentage, guardianship and travel document
issues (pdf)

in relation to children born through surrogacy abroad. You should also speak
to a solicitor who specialises in surrogacy arrangements - see 'Getting legal
advice' below.
