###  Types of surrogacy

Surrogacy arrangements can be either:

  * Domestic (the whole process takes place in Ireland) 
  * International (aspects of the process happen abroad, for example, the surrogate mother conceives and gives birth to the child abroad, before the commissioning parents take the child home to Ireland). 

_Altruistic surrogacy_ is where the surrogate mother wants to help the couple
trying to conceive, without getting a financial reward. _Commercial surrogacy_
is where the surrogate mother carries a baby in exchange for payment. Both
altruistic and commercial surrogacy arrangements are unregulated in Ireland at
present.

Before you choose to have a baby by surrogacy, you should get legal advice
from a solicitor who specialises in family law and surrogacy arrangements. See
‘Getting legal advice’ below.
