###  Entitlement to leave

Similarly, as the commissioning mother does not become pregnant, she is not
entitled to [ statutory maternity leave ](/en/employment/employment-rights-
and-conditions/leave-and-holidays/maternity-leave/) (although an employer may
still grant it at its discretion) or [ Maternity Benefit ](/en/social-
welfare/families-and-children/maternity-benefit/) if she is in employment.
However, she (and her partner) may be able to get [ parental leave
](/en/employment/employment-rights-and-conditions/leave-and-holidays/parental-
leave/) .

The commissioning couple may also be entitled to [ parent’s leave
](/en/employment/employment-rights-and-conditions/leave-and-holidays/parents-
leave/) , depending on their circumstances. The father of a child born through
surrogacy can qualify for parent’s leave if he is the biological father of the
child and declared to be the parent of the child. In these circumstances, the
father's partner may qualify for parent's leave if they are married to, in a
civil partnership or cohabiting with the child’s biological father.

If the commissioning couple is entitled to [ parent’s leave
](/en/employment/employment-rights-and-conditions/leave-and-holidays/parents-
leave/) , they may also be able to get [ Parent’s Benefit ](/en/social-
welfare/families-and-children/parents-benefit/) . However, it’s possible to
qualify for parent’s leave and not qualify for Parent’s Benefit (for example,
if you don’t meet the PRSI contribution conditions).
