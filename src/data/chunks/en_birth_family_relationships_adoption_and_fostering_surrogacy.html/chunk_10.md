###  Adoption

Alternatively, the commissioning parents can seek to [ adopt the child
](/en/birth-family-relationships/adoption-and-fostering/domestic-adoption/) in
order to have a legal relationship with it.

If the child is being adopted, this must be done through the Adoption
Authority of Ireland. In this case, there is no guarantee that the child of a
surrogate mother would be placed with the commissioning parents.

Private adoptions are not allowed. The legal parent of a child (the surrogate
mother) cannot be paid to place the child for adoption.
