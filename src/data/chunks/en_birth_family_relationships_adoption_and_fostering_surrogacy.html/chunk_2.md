##  What is surrogacy?

_Surrogacy_ is where a _surrogate mother_ agrees to become pregnant and carry
a baby to term for another couple or individual. When the baby is born, the
surrogate mother gives the baby to the couple or person with whom she made the
agreement. The intended parents or parent of the child (the adults who will
raise the child) are known as the _commissioning couple_ or the _commissioning
person_ .

Commissioning parents do not automatically have the same rights as other
parents. For example, as the commissioning mother does not become pregnant,
she cannot get maternity leave. Read more in the section ‘Legal status and
rights of the parents’ below.
