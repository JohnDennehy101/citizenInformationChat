##  Legal status and rights of the parents

Currently, there is no specific legislation for surrogacy in Ireland. It is
not legal or illegal.

Current Irish legislation does not cover the specific legal issues that arise
in surrogacy. Instead, the legal status and rights of all people involved are
covered by the laws dealing with non-surrogate births.

This means the surrogate mother, who gives birth to the child, is the childâ€™s
legal mother and guardian. This is the case even if she is not the biological
mother of the child (where her egg is not used).

Also, if the surrogate mother is married or was married around the date of
conception, then her husband is generally presumed, in Irish law, to be the
father of the child (unless it is proven otherwise). This is set out in [
Section 46 of the Status of Children Act 1987
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1987/en/act/pub/0026/sec0046.html#sec46) .
The husband will also, along with the surrogate mother, be the joint guardian
of the child.

If the surrogate mother is not married, then she is the sole automatic
guardian of the child.
