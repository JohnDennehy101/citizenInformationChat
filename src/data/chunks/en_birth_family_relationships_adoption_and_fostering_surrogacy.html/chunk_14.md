####  Parental orders

When commenced, Section 204 will allow the intending parent or parents of a
child born in the State as a result of assisted human reproduction under a
domestic surrogacy agreement where at least one of the intending parents
provided an egg or sperm to apply to the court for a parental order.

Where the court grants a parental order in respect of a child:

  * The child becomes the child of the intending parent or parents named in the order 
  * The child is no longer the child of any person other than a person named as a parent in the order 
  * The child will be considered, with regard to the rights and duties of parents and children in relation to each other, as the child of the intending parent or parents named in the order, 
  * The surrogate mother of the child will lose all parental rights and will no longer have any parental duties in respect of the child
