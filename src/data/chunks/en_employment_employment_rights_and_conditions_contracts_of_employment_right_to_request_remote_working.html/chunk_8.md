##  Making a request for remote working

When making a remote working request to your employer, you must:

  * Submit it as soon as reasonably practicable, but at least 8 weeks before the proposed start 
  * Provide a written request or use an online application form 
  * Outline details of the remote working arrangement, such as how many days and which days you are requesting 
  * Set out your reasons for requesting remote working 
  * Set out the proposed start date and duration of the arrangement 
  * Detail the proposed remote location, such as at home or a work hub 
  * Give information on the suitability of the proposed remote working location, for example the workstation is suitably equipped and meets health and safety requirements (see page 16 of the [ WRC code of practice ](https://www.workplacerelations.ie/en/what_you_should_know/codes_practice/code-of-practice-for-employers-and-employees-right-to-request-flexible-working-and-right-to-request-remote-working/code-of-practice-for-employers-and-employees.pdf) for detailed guidance on relevant information to include) 

Your request is your chance to explain to your employer why you are confident
you can do your job remotely and the specific reasons for the request. Some
examples could include:

  * Reducing your commute and carbon footprint 
  * Improving the quality of life outside working hours 
  * Personal or domestic circumstances 
  * Special medical needs that prefer a quiet working environment
