###  **Reasons your employer can terminate your arrangement**

Your employer may want to end the arrangement because of:

  * Seasonal changes in workload 
  * Unavailability of someone to do your job in your employer's workplace 
  * The nature of your job responsibilities 
  * Any other factors affecting the operation of their business 

Employers should ensure their reasons for termination are fair, objective, and
reasonable.
