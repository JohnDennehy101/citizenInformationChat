##  How long do penalty points stay on my licence?

Penalty points remain on your licence record for 3 years. Any period where
your licence is out of date or you are serving a court disqualification does
not count as part of the 3 years.

If you accumulate 12 points or 7 where applicable and are disqualified from
driving for 6 months, the points which led to the disqualification are removed
at the end of the 6 months.

But if you had more offences that had not been endorsed on your licence record
by the time you started your 6 month suspension, these extra points would be
added to your licence record and would remain on your licence for 3 years
(from the time your licence was reinstated).
