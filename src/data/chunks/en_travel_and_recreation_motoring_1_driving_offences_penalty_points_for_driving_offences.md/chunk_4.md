####  Fixed charge and penalty offences

Fixed notice penalties are issued for driving offences that attract penalty
points and/or just a fine.

If you receive a fixed notice penalty, you will be issued a notice by the
Department of Transport. If you pay the fixed charge fine within 56 days, you
will get a further notice from the Department of Transport confirming that the
penalty points will be added to your driving licence. The penalty points will
be added to your licence 28 days after that.

If you do not pay the fixed charge fine within 56 days, you will get a summons
to appear in the District Court. If you are convicted of a driving offence in
court, the court will notify the Department of Transport of the number of
penalty points attached to that conviction. The Department of Transport will
then issue a notification that these penalty points will be added to your
driving licence 28 days after the notification date.

You can get information on fixed charge notices and fines in our [ document on
