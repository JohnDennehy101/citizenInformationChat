###  Do penalty points apply to all Irish driving licences?

Yes. Penalty points apply to both learner permits and full Irish driving
licences. Penalty points also apply to drivers with foreign driving licences
driving in Ireland. If someone is driving in Ireland on a foreign licence, a
record will be created for penalty points. If the driver accumulates 12
penalty points in a 3-year period, they are disqualified from driving in
Ireland.
