###  **Noise from dogs**

If your neighbour’s dog is barking, you should go to your neighbour directly
to try resolve the issue. If this doesn’t work, you can complain to the
District Court.

You can do this by completing a Section 108 Form, which you can get from your
local authority or District Court. Before you do this, you must let the dog
owner know that you are making a complaint.

To deal with noise from a dog, the Court can:

  * Order the dog owner (or occupier of the house where the dog is kept) to exercise control over the dog to reduce the barking 
  * Limit the number of dogs that can be kept on a property 
  * Order that the dog warden takes the dog to the dog shelter 
  * Make the owner pay a fine for the noise and cost of taking and keeping the in the shelter. 

You can find out more about owning a dog on our page [ Dog licences and
ownership ](/en/environment/pets-and-wildlife/control-of-dogs/) .
