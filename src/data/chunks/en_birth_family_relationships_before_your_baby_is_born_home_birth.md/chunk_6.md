##  Private home birth arrangements

Alternatively, you can engage a SECM privately and your antenatal, delivery
and postnatal care will be provided by them. If you enter into a private
arrangement with a private midwife or an SECM for a home birth that has not
been approved by the HSE Designated Midwifery Officer, it is the
responsibility of your midwife to have appropriate insurance cover and you
should be sure that such cover is in place.
