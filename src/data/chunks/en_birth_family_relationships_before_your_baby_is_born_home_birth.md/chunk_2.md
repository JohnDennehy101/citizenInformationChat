##  Introduction

If you have a low-risk pregnancy, you may choose to have a home birth. The
Health Service Executive (HSE) has a [ National Home Birth Service
](http://www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/3/maternity/homebirth_services.html) for
eligible expectant mothers who wish to have a home birth under the care of a
Self-Employed Community Midwife (SECM).

In some HSE areas, the service may be available through a maternity hospital
or a HSE scheme. However, in other HSE areas, only private SECMs are available
to attend a home birth – see ‘How to apply’ below.

Since June 2022, a temporary suspension of the HSE home birth service in the
Midwest is in place pending the outcome of an external review of the service.
