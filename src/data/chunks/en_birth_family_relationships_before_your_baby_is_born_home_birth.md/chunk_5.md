##  How the National Home Birth Service works

If you want to find out more about the [ National Home Birth Service
](https://www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/3/maternity/homebirth-services.html) ,
you need to contact your [ Local Health Office
](https://www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/1/lho/) . You will be put through to
the designated official who is a qualified midwife. You will be sent an
information pack.

You will need to contact a Self-Employed Community Midwife (SECM). An SECM has
an agreement with the HSE to deliver the home birth service according to
certain terms and conditions. You and the midwife should fill out an
application form for the service. Your midwife will send the form to the HSE
Designated Midwifery Officer (DMO) who will assess your eligibility for the
service.

If your application is accepted, this entitles you to free care during your
pregnancy, during labour and birth, and for up to 14 days after your baby is
born. The HSE will provide you with a Home Birth Pack with all the information
you will need for a home delivery. You can find more detailed information
about the process in [ Appendix 4 Pathway of Care
](http://www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/3/maternity/homebirth_services.html#Appendix
4) on hse.ie.

Your eligibility for a home birth is continually assessed right up until your
baby is born. If, at any stage, you are assessed as not eligible to have your
baby at home, your midwife and the DMO can help you to find a suitable
maternity unit or hospital.
