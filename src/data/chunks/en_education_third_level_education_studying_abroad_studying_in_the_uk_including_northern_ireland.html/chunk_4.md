###  Finding a course

If you do not know the course you wish to study or you want to find out about
different courses or colleges there are useful online resources.

The [ British Council website Education UK ](https://study-
uk.britishcouncil.org/) allows you to search for undergraduate and
postgraduate courses by subject, by university or by specific area such as
Northern Ireland. It has a summary of information about each college or
university with contact details and you can make online request for brochures
about the courses. It also has general information about living in the UK
including accommodation and working while studying.

You can find [ information about UK higher education institutions and courses

website.
