##  Applying to study in the UK

**Undergraduate courses**

UCAS (University and Colleges Admissions Service) is the central applications
body for full-time undergraduate courses at UK universities and colleges.

If you need help or advice on your UCAS application, contact the Customer
Service Unit and remember to quote your UCAS Personal ID/application number.

If you are an Irish student, and applying through UCAS, they will send you an
application form for a tuition fee loan when you are offered a place on a
course.

**Postgraduate courses**

For postgraduate courses in the UK, you apply directly to the university or
college.
