###  Criminal Evidence Act 1992

The [ Criminal Evidence Act 1992
](https://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1992/act/12/enacted/en/html) makes it
easier for witnesses to give evidence in physical or sexual abuse cases by
allowing for a [ live television link ](/en/justice/witnesses/remote-hearings-
and-video-link-evidence/) with the court. In some cases, this Act forces the
spouse of the accused to give evidence for the prosecution.

The Act makes it easier for children to give evidence by getting rid of:

  * The need to give evidence on oath 
  * The need for corroboration (previously, additional evidence confirming the evidence given by the child was needed) 
  * The wearing of wigs and gowns by barristers when evidence is being given by video link
