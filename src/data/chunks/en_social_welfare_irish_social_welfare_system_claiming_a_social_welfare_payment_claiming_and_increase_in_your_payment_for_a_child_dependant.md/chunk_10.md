##  Full-rate and half-rate increases

For most social welfare payments, you get a full-rate Increase for a Qualified
Child (IQC) if you:

  * Get an Increase for a Qualified Adult for your spouse, civil partner or cohabitant, or 
  * Are parenting alone 

You get a half-rate IQC if your spouse, civil partner or cohabitant has an
income of between €310 and €400 a week. However, different rules apply to:

  * Carer’s Allowance 
  * Jobseeker's Allowance 
  * Disability Allowance 
  * Farm Assist 

Only one increase is paid for each qualified child. If you and your spouse,
civil partner, or cohabitant are both getting a social welfare payment, you
will each get a half-rate IQC for each child.

If you get an Increase for a Qualified Adult with [ Supplementary Welfare
Allowance (SWA) ](/en/social-welfare/supplementary-welfare-
schemes/supplementary-welfare-allow/) , you get a full-rate IQC. A half-rate
IQC is not payable with SWA.
