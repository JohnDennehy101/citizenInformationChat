###  Carer's Allowance

You get a full-rate IQC with [ Carer's Allowance ](/en/social-
welfare/carers/carers-allowance/) if you are parenting alone.

You get a half-rate IQC with Carer's Allowance if you are living with your
spouse, civil partner or cohabitant.

If you are getting half-rate Carer's Allowance, you do not get an IQC. This is
because the IQC is already included in yours, or your partnerâ€™s, main social
welfare payment.
