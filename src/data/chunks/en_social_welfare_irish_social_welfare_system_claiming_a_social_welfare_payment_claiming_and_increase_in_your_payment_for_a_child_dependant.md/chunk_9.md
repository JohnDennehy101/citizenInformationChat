###  If your child gets a social welfare payment

You do not get an IQC if your child is getting a social welfare payment or [
Supplementary Welfare Allowance ](/en/social-welfare/supplementary-welfare-
schemes/supplementary-welfare-allow/) in their own right (with the exception
of Disablement Benefit).

However, if you are getting an IQC during the summer holiday period between
academic years and your child becomes entitled to a social welfare payment in
their own right, you will continue to get the IQC and your child's payment is
reduced by the amount of the IQC.
