###  Children aged 18 and over

If your child is 18 or over, you can continue getting an IQC for 3 months
after they leave second level education, or finish the Leaving Certificate (if
they are not getting a social welfare payment in their own right). You can
still get an IQC if your child starts work immediately after finishing school.

If your child is in full-time education and you are getting a long-term social
welfare payment, or a [ short-term social welfare payment
](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/ed7325-operational-guidelines-increase-
for-a-qualified-child/) for at least 156 days, you will get an IQC:

  * Until your child turns 22, or 
  * Until the end of the academic year in which they turn 22 

If you are getting a short-term social welfare payment, time spent on other
social welfare payments can be combined to meet the 156 days. However, the
period between any 2 payments cannot be more than 26 weeks. In the case of [
Jobseeker's Allowance ](/en/social-welfare/unemployed-people/jobseekers-
allowance/) payments, the period between payments cannot be more than 52
weeks.
