###  For people getting jobseeker's payments

In general, VTOS participants who move from jobseeker's payments get a VTOS
training allowance at the maximum rate of the jobseeker's payment.

Generally, your entitlement to a VTOS training allowance will not be
reassessed if there is a change to your circumstances (including means).

**VTOS training allowance and work:** If you are returning to your course for
a second year, you will continue to get your VTOS allowance during the summer
months. You can also take up full-time work during the summer months and your
VTOS payment is not affected.

**VTOS training allowance and dependants:** If you want a dependent adult or
child added to your payment you must notify the Department of Social
Protection (DSP). DSP will then notify the ETB of any changes to your VTOS
training allowance.
