###  HSCL home visits

The home visit is one of the key ways the HSCL co-ordinator works with the
family to improve the child’s progress at school.

The co-ordinator visits parents in the family home or can meet them in the
child’s school, Family Resource Centre or other suitable location, if
necessary.

During the home visit the HSCL co-ordinator hears parent’s views and brings
information about the school and services in the community.
