##  How can I access the Home School Community Liaison Scheme?

The HSCL is available in all urban DEIS schools (band 1 and band 2) and in all
DEIS post-primary schools. You can see the [ list of DEIS schools
](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/7938e-list-of-schools-into-deis/) .

The school will identify children who need HSCL support.

You should contact the school principal if you need further information.

You can read more in the [ Information booklet for DEIS schools participating
the Home School Liaison Scheme ](https://www.gov.ie/pdf/39197/?page=1) and on
the [ Department of Educationâ€™s website
](https://www.gov.ie/en/service/6c72da-home-school-community-liaison-scheme-
hscl/) .
