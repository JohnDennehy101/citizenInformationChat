##  Step 1: Find weekly household income

Find your total weekly household income. For example:

**Income source** **Amount per week  
** Assessable income from part-time employment - see **Note 1**  
Social welfare payments  
FÁS training allowance  
Family Income Supplement  
Cash income (for example, maintenance)  
Capital (for example, property, savings and investments) - see **Note 2**

**Note 1**  
Assessable income from part-time employment is gross income less PRSI and
reasonable travel expenses.

How your travel expenses are assessed can depend on where you live.

**Note 2  
** The capital value of property (except your own home), investments and
savings will be assessed on a weekly basis as follows:

First €5,000 is not taken into account  
Next €10,000 is assessed at €1 per €1,000  
Next €25,000 is assessed at €2 per €1,000  
Any capital over €40,000 is assessed at €4 per €1,000.
