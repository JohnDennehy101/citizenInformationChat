##  Step 3: Deduct Supplementary Welfare Allowance rate

Subtract the basic [ Supplementary Welfare Allowance (SWA) ](/en/social-
welfare/supplementary-welfare-schemes/supplementary-welfare-allow/) weekly
rate for your household from the weekly household income after disregards that
you calculated in Step 2, unless you have applied the Additional Household
Income Disregard. If you applied the Additional Household Income Disregard in
Step 2 you will have already deducted the appropriate SWA rate for your
household.

If you are 26 years of age or over, the basic weekly SWA rate in 2014 is:

Personal rate  |  €186   
---|---  
Adult dependant  |  €124.80   
Child dependant  |  €29.80   
  
People under 26 years of age get a reduced age related rate of Supplementary
Welfare Allowance. However, there are exceptions and some people under 26 may
get a higher basic SWA rate. More information on the SWA rate for people under
26 can be found in our document on [ Supplementary Welfare Allowance
](/en/social-welfare/supplementary-welfare-schemes/supplementary-welfare-
allow/) .

**You should now have calculated your weekly assessable income.**
