##  Introduction

**From 1 January 2014, the Mortgage Interest Supplement scheme is closed to
new entrants and no new applications will be accepted from this date.** This
measure does not affect current claimants immediately (people who were getting
Mortgage Interest Supplement before 1 January 2014). The scheme will be wound
down for existing claimants over a 4-year period.

Before you start to calculate your Mortgage Interest Supplement you must check
whether you qualify. More information on the qualifying criteria is available
in our document on [ Mortgage Interest Supplement ](/en/social-
welfare/supplementary-welfare-schemes/mortgage-interest-supplement/) .

You will only get help with the interest portion of your mortgage repayments.
You will not get help with the portion that pays off the actual loan and house
insurance. Your interest is assessed as your gross monthly interest less any [
mortgage interest relief ](/en/housing/owning-a-home/buying-a-home/mortgage-
interest-relief/) and any  mortgage allowance  or [ mortgage subsidy
](/en/housing/owning-a-home/help-with-buying-a-home/first-home-scheme/)
payable towards the interest part of your mortgage by the local authority.

Calculating Mortgage Interest Supplement is very complex. The Community
Welfare Officer (CWO) will calculate your entitlement to Mortgage Interest
Supplement. If you have any questions about your entitlement to Mortgage
Interest Supplement you should contact your local CWO.

This document shows you the steps involved in calculating Mortgage Interest
Supplement. There are 5 steps:

  * **Step 1** is to find your _weekly household income_ . 
  * **Steps 2 and 3** are to find out your _weekly assessable income_ . Only a certain amount of your weekly household income is taken into account. Your _assessable income_ is the amount of household income which is taken into account when calculating your Mortgage Interest Supplement. 
  * **Step 4** is to find your _total monthly contribution to mortgage interest_ by adding your weekly assessable income and the minimum Household Contribution. 
  * **Step 5** is to find your Mortgage Interest Supplement by subtracting your _total monthly contribution to your mortgage_ interest from the monthly mortgage interest due to your lender.
