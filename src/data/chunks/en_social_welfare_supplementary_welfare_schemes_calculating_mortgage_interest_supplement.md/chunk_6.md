###  Additional Household Income Disregard

If you are working or getting maintenance or have _additional household
income*_ you should apply the Additional Household Income Disregard.

Additional Household Income Disregard is a certain amount of your household
income above the SWA rate which is not taken into account. €75 of any
_additional household income_ is not taken into account. Also, 25% of your
_additional household income_ over €75 is not taken into account. There is no
upper limit on the amount that can be disregarded – see **Note 3** .

***Additional household income** includes income from the following:

  * Part-time employment or part-time self employment 
  * Any employment or training scheme, for example, [ Community Employment ](/en/employment/unemployment-and-redundancy/employment-support-schemes/community-services-programme/) or [ Back to Work Enterprise Allowance ](/en/social-welfare/social-welfare-payments-and-work/back-to-work-enterprise-allowance/) . 
  * [ Working Family Payment ](/en/social-welfare/families-and-children/working-family-payment/)
  * Maintenance payments over €95.23 

**To calculate the Additional Household Income Disregard:**

Additional household income  
Less Supplementary Welfare Allowance rate – see **Step 3** below  
Less €75  
Less 25% of any income you have after you have subtracted €75

**For example**  
---  
Income (less SWA rate ) €200  
Less _€75_  
Total €125  Get 25% of total: €125 ÷ 4 = €31.25  Add both disregards: €75 +
€31.25 = €106.25  Household Income Disregard = €106.25  
  
**Note 3: Rehabilitative Earnings Disregard  
** If you are working and getting Disability Allowance or Blind Pension you
can either use the Rehabilitative Earnings Disregard or the Additional
Household Income Disregard (but not both). Use whichever is in your interest.

Rehabilitative Earnings Disregard is a certain amount of your income from
rehabilitative work which is not taken into account. €120 from rehabilitative
training or employment is not taken into account. In the assessment for
contribution to Mortgage Interest Supplement all earnings over €120 from
rehabilitative training or employment are taken into account and will affect
your Mortgage Interest Supplement.
