##  Step 4: Find your monthly contribution to mortgage interest

  
Find the total amount you must pay towards your mortgage interest.  
  
To do this, add your weekly assessable income (this is the total figure from
Step 3) and your minimum Household Contribution (either €30 or €40 per week –
see **Note 5** ).  
  
Then multiply this figure by 52 and divide by 12 to get your monthly
contribution to mortgage interest  
  
Weekly assessable income €  
Add Household Contribution €____  
Total weekly contribution to mortgage interest €  
x 52  
€  
÷ 12  
Monthly contribution to mortgage interest €  
**  
  
Note 5: Further information about the Household Contribution **

You must contribute at least €30 towards your mortgage interest. Couples pay
€40.

Non-dependent household members who are solely dependent on a personal social
welfare payment must also contribute at least €30. However, if [ benefit and
privilege ](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/means-test-for-
social-welfare-payments/how-parents-income-can-affect-jobseekers-allowance/)
has been assessed against your social welfare payment you will not have to
contribute €30.

The Community Welfare Officer can reduce the amount of Mortgage Interest
Supplement payable by an amount which in their opinion should be payable by
each non-dependent household member in employment. Custom and practice is that
the assessable income of the non-dependent household member (that is, gross
income less PRSI and travel costs to work) is divided by the appropriate rate
of SWA for their situation which is then multiplied by €30 to establish their
liability to contribute.

**For example**  
---  
Your 26 year old daughter is living with you and earning €700 per week:  €700
÷ €186 (SWA) = €3.76  Multiply 3.76 by €30 = €112.80  Mortgage Interest
Supplement is reduced by €112.80  
  
  
A couple over 65 with an income equal or less than the State Pension
(Contributory) for their situation will contribute €40 towards their mortgage
interest. A couple who both have State Pensions (Contributory) and no other
income will also contribute €40 towards their mortgage interest.
