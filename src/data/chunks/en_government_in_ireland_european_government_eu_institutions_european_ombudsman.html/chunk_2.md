##  Introduction

The office of the European Ombudsman was established in 1992 by the [
Maastricht Treaty ](https://europa.eu/european-union/law/treaties_en) . Its
purpose is to investigate complaints made by citizens and people living in the
[ European Union (EU) ](/en/government-in-ireland/european-
government/european-union/european-union/) of maladministration in the
institutions and bodies of the EU. They are also responsible for proactively
looking into broader systemic issues and launching their own investigations.

" _Maladministration_ " means bad administration and happens if an institution
does not respect:

  * Fundamental rights 
  * Laws or rules 
  * The principles of good administration 

Some examples of maladministration are:

  * Discrimination 
  * Abuse of power 
  * Lack or refusal of information and 
  * Unnecessary delay 

The role of the European Ombudsman is to safeguard the fundamental rights of
people living in the EU by promoting open and accountable administrations
within the EU. The role of the Ombudsman is complementary to that of the
courts. A finding of maladministration by the Ombudsman does not automatically
mean that something illegal has happened.

The European Ombudsman delivers an Annual Report to the [ European Parliament
