###  **Involuntary liquidation (insolvency)**

When a company is forcibly closed by the court, this is called an involuntary
liquidation.

This process can be started by a creditor, a member of the company, or in some
cases, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade, and Employment. In this process,
the court appoints a liquidator to oversee the winding up of the company.
