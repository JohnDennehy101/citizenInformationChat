##  Check if your passport is valid

Ideally, your passport should be valid for 6 months after the date you return
home. If it is due to expire, you should [ renew your passport
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/travel-and-
recreation/passports/renewing-an-irish-passport/) at least 6 weeks before you
travel. If your [ passport is lost or stolen
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/travel-and-
recreation/passports/replacing-a-lost-or-stolen-irish-passport/) , you should
report it missing and replace it.

If you are a dual citizen, you can travel on either of your passports.
However, we would recommend that you use your [ Irish passport
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/travel_and_recreation/passports/) when
travelling to Ireland.

You can use a [ passport card ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/travel-
and-recreation/passports/irish-passport-card/) if youâ€™re travelling from
certain European countries.

Children must have their own passport. If your child is eligible for an Irish
passport, you can [ apply for their first Irish passport
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/travel-and-
recreation/passports/passports-for-children/) before you move.
