###  **Prepare to find somewhere to live**

To help you find somewhere to live, you should gather relevant documents from
the country youâ€™re leaving, such as:

  * References from your current landlord 
  * Proof you have ended your tenancy abroad 
  * Proof you have sold property abroad. 

Before you arrive, research [ renting
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/housing/renting-a-home/looking-for-a-
flat-or-house-to-rent/) or [ buying
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/housing/owning-a-home/buying-a-
home/steps-involved-buying-a-home/) a home in Ireland. If this is not an
option, you may be able to apply for [ social housing
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/housing/local-authority-and-social-
housing/applying-for-local-authority-housing/) and get a [ Housing Assistance
Payment (HAP) ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/housing/renting-a-
home/help-with-renting/housing-assistance-payment/) , however you will need to
meet certain criteria before your application is accepted.
