###  Pensions

Most long-term contributory pensions such as old age or widowed pensions can
be paid in any country so you can have your pension from another country paid
in Ireland. You can read more about [ pensions in Ireland. ](/en/money-and-
tax/personal-finance/pensions/)

If you have worked in more than one [ EEA country
](https://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?catId=1115&langId=en&intPageId=4614) or
in a country with which Ireland has a [ Bilateral Social Security Agreement
](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/dc7910-guidelines-on-application-of-
bilateral-agreements/) then your periods of insurance can be combined with
Irish insurance to see if you would qualify for a pension from each country.
If you are getting a pension under EU Regulations or a Bilateral Agreement you
may be eligible for the [ Household Benefits Package ](/en/social-
welfare/extra-social-welfare-benefits/household-benefits-package/) .
