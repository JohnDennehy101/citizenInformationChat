##  How to claim tax relief

There is a Revenue form to [ Claim for Relief for Legally Enforceable
Maintenance Payments (pdf) ](https://www.revenue.ie/en/additional-
incomes/documents/claim-relief-legally-enforceable-maintenance-payments.pdf) .

If you are claiming for the current tax year, an amended certificate of tax
credits will be sent to you and your employer will pay any refund due to you.

If your claim is for a previous tax year or during a period of unemployment,
Revenue will pay you any refund due. Tax refunds can be paid by cheque or to
your bank account.
