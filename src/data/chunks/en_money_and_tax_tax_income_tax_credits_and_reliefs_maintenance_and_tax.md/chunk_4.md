###  Legally enforceable maintenance payments

Legally enforceable maintenance payments are payments you regularly make
(weekly, monthly or annually) to a former partner under:

  * A court order 
  * A deed of separation 
  * Any other legal commitment (such as a covenant or trust) 

It can also include payments that you are legally required to make on behalf
of your former partner, such as a mortgage payment.
