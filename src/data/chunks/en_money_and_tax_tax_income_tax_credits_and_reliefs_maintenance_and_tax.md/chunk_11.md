###  Legally enforceable maintenance payments

If you get a legally enforceable maintenance payment that is for your benefit,
you must pay:

  * [ Income Tax ](/en/money-and-tax/tax/income-tax/how-your-tax-is-calculated/)
  * [ Universal Social Charge ](/en/money-and-tax/tax/income-tax/universal-social-charge/) (USC) 
  * [ Pay Related Social Insurance ](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/social-insurance-prsi/) (PRSI) 

You do not pay tax on payments that are specifically for the benefit of your
children.

If you and your partner choose to be taxed as a married couple, you do not pay
tax on the maintenance payments you get.
