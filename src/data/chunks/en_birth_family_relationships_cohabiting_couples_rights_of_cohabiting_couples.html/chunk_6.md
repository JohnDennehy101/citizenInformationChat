###  Inheritance

In certain circumstances, if your partner dies when you are still in a
relationship together, you can apply to the court for a portion of their
estate, but it is _not_ necessary to prove that you were financially dependent
on them. You must apply within 6 months after the probate or administration is
first granted.

If your relationship ended 2 years or more before the death or your ex-
partner, you may only apply to the court for a portion of their estate if you
were financially dependent on them, for example, you had been getting a
maintenance payment from them, or had applied to the court for a maintenance,
property or pension adjustment order.

A gift or inheritance taken on foot of a court order under [ Part 15 of the
Civil Partnerships and Certain Rights and Obligations of Cohabitants Act 2010
](https://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2010/act/24/enacted/en/print#part15) is
exempt from Capital Acquisitions Tax (CAT).

Some examples to which the CAT exemption apply are:

  * Transfer of property 
  * Maintenance payments 
  * Property or pension adjustment orders 
  * A benefit from the net estate of a deceased cohabitant
