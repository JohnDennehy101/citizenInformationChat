##  What is cohabitation?

Living together with someone is also sometimes called ‘cohabitation’.

A cohabiting couple is a couple that lives together in an intimate and
committed relationship, who are not married to each other and not in a civil
partnership. Cohabiting couples can be opposite-sex or same-sex. A cohabiting
relationship can continue to be ‘intimate’ even if it is not sexual.

If you live together you may sometimes be described as common-law husband and
wife. There is no such thing as a common-law husband and wife in Irish
legislation. However, couples living together now have certain rights if the
relationship ends (through death or separation), though this depends on how
long you have lived together and if you have children together (see [ Redress
scheme for cohabiting couples ](/en/birth-family-relationships/problems-in-
marriages-and-other-relationships/redress-scheme-for-cohabiting-couples/) ).
