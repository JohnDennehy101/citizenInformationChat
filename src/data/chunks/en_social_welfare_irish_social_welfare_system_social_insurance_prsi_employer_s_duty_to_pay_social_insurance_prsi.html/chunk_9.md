##  PRSI and employees posted abroad

In some cases, the DSP uses a [ Special Collection System
](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/3df362-operational-guidelines-prsi-prsi-
special-collection-system/#special-collection-system) to collect PRSI
contributions from employees who are insurable under Irish social security
law, but who do not come within the [ PAYE system ](/en/employment/starting-
work-and-changing-job/starting-work/tax-and-starting-work/) .

If your employer sends you abroad for a short work assignment, EU Regulations
and [ bilateral social security agreements
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-
system/claiming-a-social-welfare-payment/social-insurance-contributions-from-
abroad/#766531) allow you to keep paying PRSI in Ireland, instead of
transferring to the social security system of another country.
