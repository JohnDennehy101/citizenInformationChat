####  Irish or UK parent

If either of your parents was an Irish or UK citizen at the time of your
birth, you are automatically an Irish citizen if you were born in Ireland. If
you were born in Northern Ireland to an Irish or British parent, you can
choose to be an Irish citizen.

If your Irish or UK citizen parent died before you were born, you are an Irish
citizen by birth.
