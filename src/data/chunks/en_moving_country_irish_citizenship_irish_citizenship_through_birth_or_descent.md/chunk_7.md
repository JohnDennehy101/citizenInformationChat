####  Parent from outside Ireland and UK

If you were born in Ireland on or after 1 January 2005 and neither of your
parents were Irish or UK citizens, your entitlement to Irish citizenship by
birth depends on your parentsâ€™ residence status and history.

One of your parents must have:

  * Lived in Ireland or Northern Ireland for 3 out of the 4 years before you were born or 
  * Have the right to live in Ireland or Northern Ireland without any restriction on their period of residence 

Only _reckonable residence_ is counted towards the 3 out of 4 years needed.
This does not include periods spent in Ireland on a student visa or while
waiting for a decision on an [ international protection application
](/en/moving-country/asylum-seekers-and-refugees/the-asylum-process-in-
ireland/applying-for-refugee-status-in-ireland/) .

If you were born in Ireland after 31 December 2004 and do not qualify as an
Irish citizen by birth, you can apply for [ citizenship by naturalisation
](/en/moving-country/irish-citizenship/becoming-an-irish-citizen-through-
naturalisation/) after you have completed 5 years of residence in Ireland. You
can apply for your child after they have completed 3 years of residence in
Ireland.
