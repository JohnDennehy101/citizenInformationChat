##  Irish citizenship when you are born abroad

If either of your parents was born in Ireland and was an Irish citizen at the
time of your birth, you are automatically an Irish citizen by birth.

If the parent through whom you are entitled to Irish citizenship was deceased
at the time of your birth, but would have been an Irish citizen if alive at
that time, you are also an Irish citizen.
