###  **Pension age**

Pension age is 66, but if you [ defer getting your State Pension
(Contributory) ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/social-
welfare-payments/older-and-retired-people/deferring-your-state-pension-
contributory/) to after age 66, you may qualify for Jobseeker's Benefit during

over.
