###  Secured and unsecured debts

A Debt Settlement Arrangement only covers _unsecured_ debts so it is important
to know whether your debts are secured or not.

A _secured_ debt is a loan on which property or goods are available as
security against non-payment. Mortgages and car loans are the most common
secured loans.

Some examples of _unsecured_ debts are: utility bill arrears (gas, electricity
etc.); credit card debt; bank overdrafts; credit union loans. However, if they
are rolled up into your mortgage, they become secured loans.
