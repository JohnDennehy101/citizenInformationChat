###  Pension income

If you are entitled to receive pension income or a pension lump sum, it will
be treated as an income/asset for the purposes of a Debt Settlement
Arrangement. The terms of the DSA may provide for some or all of that pension
lump sum or income to be paid to your creditors while the DSA is in effect.
