###  Formulating a DSA proposal

Once the protective certificate has been granted, your PIP must invite the
relevant creditors to make proposals about the manner in which the debts might
be dealt with as part of a DSA. The creditors must be given your Prescribed
Financial Statement.

In order to help the PIP to formulate the proposal, you will be required to
provide an honest and accurate account of your living expenses, your life
plans and any circumstances that may be relevant to how much of your debts you
can pay, now and in the future.

When formulating the proposal for a DSA, the PIP will ensure, as far as is
reasonably practicable, that you are not required to sell or move out of your
principal private residence (your home). If you wish to move out, or if the
PIP believes that the running costs of staying in your home are
disproportionately large, the DSA may provide for you to move out of it.
