###  Qualifying debts

As mentioned above, the only debts that a DSA can cover are _unsecured_ debts.
There is no limit on the total amount of debt that can be covered. However, if
your total debt is unsecured and is €35,000 or less, you can opt for a Debt
Relief Notice instead of a DSA.

If you have some _secured_ debts, you can apply for a Personal Insolvency
Arrangement, which can cover both secured and unsecured debts. However, if you
can manage to cover your secured debts, whether by making full repayments or
by agreeing an arrangement with your secured creditors (such as interest-only
repayments on your mortgage) you can apply for a Debt Settlement Arrangement
to cover your unsecured debts separately.

At least three-quarters (75%) of your unsecured debts must have built up at
least 6 months before you apply for a DSA – in other words, you can’t apply
for a DSA if any more than 25% of your unsecured debts were incurred in the
last 6 months.
