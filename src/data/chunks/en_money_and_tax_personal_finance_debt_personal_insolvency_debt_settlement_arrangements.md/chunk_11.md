###  Pension fund

Your pension fund itself will be excluded from any DSA arrangement if it is a
_relevant pension arrangement_ for the purposes of the Act. Approved
Retirement Funds (ARFs) are not _relevant pension arrangements_ and may be
included in a DSA.

You must be transparent in relation to all pension contributions that you have
made in the past. The PIP will review these and where the PIP or a creditor
considers that you have made excessive pension contributions within 3 years
prior to application for a protective certificate, either of them can apply to
the court to recover these contributions for distribution to creditors.
