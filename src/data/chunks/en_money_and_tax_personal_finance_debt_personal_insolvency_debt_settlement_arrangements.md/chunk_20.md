###  Issuing a Debt Settlement Arrangement

If there is no objection or an objection is not upheld, the court approves the
Debt Settlement Arrangement if satisfied that all the conditions have been
met. The Insolvency Service records the DSA in its Register of Debt Settlement
Arrangements and it comes into effect.
