##  Introduction

A Debt Settlement Arrangement (DSA) is one of [ 3 debt resolution mechanisms
](/en/money-and-tax/personal-finance/debt/personal-insolvency/personal-
insolvency-options/) for people who cannot afford to pay their personal debts.
These mechanisms offer different solutions to people in different situations.

The Debt Settlement Arrangement applies to the agreed settlement of unsecured
debts, for example, personal loans, overdrafts, credit card or credit union
loans. The arrangement usually applies over a period of 5 years. The limit of
5 years can increase to 6 years in some situations. When the DSA concludes
successfully, the debts that it covers will be fully discharged and the debtor
will be solvent again.

This page describes how to qualify for a DSA and how the DSA process works.
