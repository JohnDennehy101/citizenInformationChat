##  Main elements of a DSA

You must make your proposal for a Debt Settlement Arrangement through a
Personal Insolvency Practitioner (PIP) – see [ The DSA process
](debt_settlement_arrangements.en.html#l429e1) below.

The DSA proposal must be agreed by you and then approved at a creditors’
meeting. The proposed DSA will have to get the support of creditors
representing at least 65% of the total debt that it covers.

A DSA may involve you making regular payments of agreed amounts to your
Personal Insolvency Practitioner, who will distribute them to your creditors
according to the terms of the DSA.

Your creditors may not take any action against you to enforce the debt during
the lifetime of the DSA. If you keep to the terms of the DSA, the rest of your
debt to the creditors that it covered will be discharged and you will be
solvent again.
