##  The DSA process

You must make your proposal for a DSA through a Personal Insolvency
Practitioner (PIP). This is a professional who is authorised by the [
Insolvency Service of Ireland (ISI) ](https://www.isi.gov.ie/) and will act on
your behalf throughout the Debt Settlement Arrangement.

The ISI has developed a standard protocol for use by PIPs when making
straightforward proposals to creditors for a DSA.

You must disclose all details of your financial affairs to the PIP, who will
then advise you whether or not you meet the conditions for a DSA, what the
consequences will be and what fees you may have to pay. The PIP will also
advise you of any other options that are available.

The PIP will help you complete a Prescribed Financial Statement as part of
your application, giving full and honest information about your financial
circumstances.

You must also make a declaration that you have been unable to agree an
alternative repayment arrangement with your creditor(s).

You will have to give your written consent to enable:

  * The PIP to disclose your personal data to the ISI 
  * The ISI to process your application 
  * The ISI to make any necessary enquiries about you and 
  * The ISI to disclose your personal data to the creditors concerned, as required 

In general, you must act in good faith and co-operate fully with the process.
