###  When a Debt Settlement Arrangement ends

If the arrangement ends other than by successful completion, you become fully
liable for all specified debts, **including** arrears, charges and interest
that have accrued during the DSA period, **less** any payments made by you
during that time, **unless** the terms of the DSA specify, or the court has
ordered, otherwise.

If the arrangement is successfully completed, you are discharged from the
debts covered by the DSA. The successful completion is recorded on the
Register of Debt Settlement Arrangements. You are now solvent.
