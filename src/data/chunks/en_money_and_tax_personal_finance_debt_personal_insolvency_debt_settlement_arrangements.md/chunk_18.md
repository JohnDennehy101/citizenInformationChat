###  Creditors’ meeting

When you have consented to the proposal for a DSA that has been formulated by
your PIP, the PIP must call a creditors’ meeting. If there is only one
creditor, he or she may write to the PIP indicating agreement or rejection.
The creditors vote on whether or not to accept the proposed arrangement. Each
vote is proportional to the amount of debt owed to that creditor. In order for
the arrangement to be accepted, creditors representing 65% or more of the
value of your total unsecured debt must vote in favour of the proposal.

If the creditors reject the proposal, the protective certificate ceases to
have effect and the DSA process will have come to an end.

If the proposal is accepted, the PIP must inform the Insolvency Service and
tell creditors of their right to object to the relevant court - (the Circuit
Court in cases up to €2.5 million and the High Court in larger cases). The
Insolvency Service notifies the court. If there is any objection, the
protective certificate remains in place until the matter is decided.
