###  Excluded debts

The Personal Insolvency Act 2012 specifies certain types of debt that
**cannot** be written off by the new debt settlement procedures, which include
the Debt Settlement Arrangement. These are called _excluded_ debts.

The types of debt that are _excluded_ and cannot be covered by a DSA are:

  * Debts under family law orders, such as [ maintenance orders ](/en/birth-family-relationships/separation-and-divorce/maintenance-orders-and-agreements/) for spouses and children 
  * Debts due under court awards for personal injury or wrongful death 
  * Debts arising from a loan (or forbearance of a loan) obtained through fraud or similar wrongdoing 
  * Debts arising under fines imposed by the courts for criminal offences or court orders made under the Proceeds of Crime Acts
