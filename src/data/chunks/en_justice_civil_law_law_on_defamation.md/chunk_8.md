###  Honest opinion

The defence of ‘honest opinion’ may apply where you give your opinion and all
of these conditions are met:

  * The opinion is honestly held 
  * The opinion is based on allegations of facts that are set out with the statement or known to the person complaining of defamation (or that they could reasonably be expected to have known), or based on allegations of fact that are privileged (for example, based on the judgment of a court) 
  * The matter is of public interest 

The opinion is ‘honestly held’ if the person making the statement believed the
truth of the allegation at the time of making the statement. The person who
offers the defence must prove that the opinion was honestly held.

If the publisher is sued (for example, the newspaper that published a
columnist’s opinion), the publisher must prove that they believed that the
opinion was honestly held.

Defamatory statements relating to a person’s private life will generally not
apply as it is unlikely to be of “public interest”.
