###  Fair and reasonable publication

A statement made in good faith and about something that is in the public
interest may not be defamatory. The court will consider:

  * The seriousness of the allegations 
  * How much the statement was about the performance of a personâ€™s public duties 
  * If the statement made it clear that when it was discussing allegations or suspicions, rather than facts 
  * If there were exceptional circumstances that made it necessary to publish the statement 
  * If the person who was the subject of the statement was given the opportunity to give their side of events
