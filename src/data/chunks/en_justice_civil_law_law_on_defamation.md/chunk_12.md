##  How to make a defamation complaint

If you believe that a defamatory statement has been made about you that
damages your reputation, you can take a complaint to court. Defamation
hearings in the [ High Court ](/en/justice/courts-system/high-court/) are
sometimes held with a jury. You must generally make a claim within one year of
the defamatory statement being issued.

You can apply for an injunction to prevent a defamatory statement from being
published, or to have a defamatory statement removed (from a website for
example). An injunction is an order of the court that compels a person or body
to either do something or refrain from doing something.

Before taking a complaint to court, you should get legal advice. There are
other options available including:

  * [ Making a complaint ](/en/consumer/how-to-complain/complain-about-media/) to the organisation that published the statement 
  * Making a complaint to the [ Press Council ](https://www.presscouncil.ie/) or the [ Broadcasting Authority of Ireland ](https://www.bai.ie/en/) for corporations that are regulated by those organisations 

The Press Council and the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland cannot investigate
complaints where legal action has already commenced.
