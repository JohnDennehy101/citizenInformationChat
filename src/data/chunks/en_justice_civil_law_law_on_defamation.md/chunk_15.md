###  An Offer of Amends

The maker of a defamatory statement may make an “offer of amends” in writing
to the person who is alleged to have been defamed. That offer of amends will
include an offer to make a suitable correction and a sufficient apology. The
correction and apology will be published in an appropriate place. The offer of
amends may also include an offer to pay compensation or damages.

If an appropriate offer of amends is not accepted, it can be used in some
cases as a defence to any later legal proceedings.
