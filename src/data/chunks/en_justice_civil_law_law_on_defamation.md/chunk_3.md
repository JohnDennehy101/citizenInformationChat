##  What is defamation?

To take a case for defamation, you must show that the statement you are
complaining about was ‘published’ to at least one other person. The ‘one other
person’ cannot only be the person who is taking the complaint.

‘Published’ includes any type of communication, for example:

  * Conversation with another person 
  * Comments made on social media 
  * Newspaper articles 
  * Blog posts 
  * Speeches 

The ‘defamatory statement’ must also be something that a reasonable person
would think injures your reputation.

The person or organisation that made the statement can defend their actions as
described below.
