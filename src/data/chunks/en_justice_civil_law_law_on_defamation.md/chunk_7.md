###  Qualified privilege

Certain statements may be privileged, but can lose the privilege if the
statement was made maliciously, or if the person later refuses to correct an
inaccuracy.

This includes statements made by you to:

  * A person who had a duty or interest in receiving the statement or 
  * A person who you reasonably believed had a duty or interest in receiving the statement 

and

  * Where you had a duty or interest in making the statement to the person or persons. 

For example, if you believed that your work colleague was not following [
health and safety requirements ](/en/employment/employment-rights-and-
conditions/health-and-safety/health-safety-work/) and causing some risk or
danger, and you reported this to your employerâ€™s health and safety officer,
the report may be privileged. This is only if you honestly believed that what
you told the health and safety officer was true.

A common form of qualified privilege is fair and accurate reporting of court
proceedings and court decisions.
