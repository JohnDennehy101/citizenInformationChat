##  Introduction

You can take legal action against a person or corporation who makes a
‘defamatory statement’ to another person.

A defamatory statement is a statement that reasonable members of society would
think damages your reputation. A statement is not defamatory if it is true or
substantially true.

Since the [ Defamation Act 2009
](https://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2009/act/31/enacted/en/print) ,
‘defamation’ has replaced both ‘slander’ and ‘libel’.
