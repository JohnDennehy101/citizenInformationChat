###  **5\. Progression in education**

You must be progressing in your education. This means that you must be
attending a course:

  * That will give you a higher level of qualification than you already have 
  * That is a higher level than any other course you attended before 
  * Where you will be progressing your studies and will not be repeating any part of a course (except in exceptional circumstances)
