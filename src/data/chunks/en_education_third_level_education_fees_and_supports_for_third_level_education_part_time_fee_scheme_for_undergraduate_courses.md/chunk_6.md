###  **3\. Means test**

The part-time fee scheme is means-tested and a student’s total reckonable
household income must fall below specific income thresholds.

The means test for 2024-2025 is based on your and your family's gross income
for the previous full tax year (2023).

SUSI looks at all ’reckonable income’ when assessing your student grant
application. Reckonable income is gross income from all sources. Some social
welfare payments and financial support payments are excluded.

For the part-time fee scheme, up to €7,925 of your earnings during the
previous calendar year can be deducted from your reckonable income.

Your [ applicant class ](https://www.susi.ie/eligibility-
criteria/income/applicant-class/) determines whose income is included in the
income calculation for grant assessment purposes. There are 3 types of
applicant class:

  * [ Dependent student ](https://www.susi.ie/eligibility-criteria/income/applicant-class/dependent-students/)
  * [ Mature dependent student ](https://www.susi.ie/eligibility-criteria/income/applicant-class/dependent-students/#d.en.11691:~:text=Will%20Appointed\)%20Guardians-,Mature%20Dependent%20Student,-If%20you%20were)
  * [ Independent student ](https://www.susi.ie/eligibility-criteria/income/applicant-class/independent-students/)
