##  Things to think about before you switch

Before switching, you should consider:

  * **Loan-to-value (LTV) ratio** – this is how much you owe on your mortgage in relation to how much your house is worth. Lenders look at your LTV ratio when you make your application. You need an up-to-date valuation of your home to get an accurate LTV. 
  * **Outstanding balance** – if the outstanding balance on your mortgage is very low, you may find it difficult to switch your mortgage, as lenders often have a minimum loan amount. 
  * **Negative equity** – this means you owe more on your mortgage than your property is worth. Lenders may not offer you a loan if you are in negative equity. 
  * **Mortgage term** – minimum or maximum loan terms may apply when you are switching. For example, some lenders may not accept an application for a mortgage over 30 years or less than 5 years. 
  * **Repayment history** – whether you have been meeting your mortgage repayments over the previous 12 months. Lenders will also check any other financial obligations you have and your [ credit history ](/en/money-and-tax/personal-finance/loans-and-credit/your-credit-history/) . 
  * **Fixed term** – If you are on a fixed rate and want to leave it early, you may have to pay a fee, sometimes called a redemption charge. The cost of this charge should be weighed against potential savings that could be made by switching, or you can wait until you are coming to the end of your fixed term and then switch.
