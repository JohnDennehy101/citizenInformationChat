##  Is there a good time to switch?

The right time to switch depends on your reason for switching and whether you
will make a saving, taking into account any fees you may be charged. Many
people think about switching when they reach the end of a fixed term rate or
if interest rates are increasing.

Switching your mortgage is likely to take at least a couple of months. There
may be longer waiting times if things are busy. It may also take time for you
to gather the documents you need, get a valuation and arrange insurance.
