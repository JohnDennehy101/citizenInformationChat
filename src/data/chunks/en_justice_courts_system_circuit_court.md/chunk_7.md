###  Local Jurisdiction

The criminal jurisdiction is exercised by the judge of the Circuit in which:

  * The offence was committed or 
  * The defendant resides or carries on business, or 
  * The defendant was arrested 

However, the Circuit Judge may transfer a criminal trial from one part of
their Circuit to another.

On application by the [ Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP)
](https://www.dppireland.ie/) or the accused, the Circuit Judge may, if
satisfied that it would be manifestly unjust not to do so, transfer the trial
from the Circuit Court sitting outside of the Dublin Circuit to the Dublin
Circuit Court.
