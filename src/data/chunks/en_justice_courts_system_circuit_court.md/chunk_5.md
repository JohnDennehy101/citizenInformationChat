###  Limited Jurisdiction

Civil cases in the Circuit Court are tried by a judge sitting without a jury.

The Circuit Court is restricted to hearing cases where the damages or
compensation sought do not exceed a certain amount.

The Circuit Court has jurisdiction, which means it can hear and decide cases:

  * In actions for defamation where the claim does not exceed €75,000

  * In family law proceedings (including judicial separation, divorce, nullity and appeals from the District Court) where the market value of the property exceeds €3,000,000, the parties may opt to transfer the case to the High Court;
