###  Local Jurisdiction

A Circuit Court can only hear a case that has been commenced in the correct
county.

The case must be brought, heard and decided in the county:

  * In proceedings based on tort (for example, personal injuries actions), where the tort is alleged to have been committed or where the defendant or one of the defendants ordinarily resides or carries on any profession, business or occupation; 
  * In proceedings based on contract, where the contract was made or where the defendant or one of the defendants ordinarily resides or carries on any profession, business or occupation; 
  * In proceedings to eject a person from lands or property, where the lands or property in question are located; 
  * In family proceedings, where the applicant resides; 
  * Under the probate jurisdiction and for administration of estates of deceased persons, where the testator or intestate at the time of his death had a fixed place of abode; 
  * Under the lunacy jurisdiction, where the person of, or alleged to be of, unsound mind ordinarily resides.
