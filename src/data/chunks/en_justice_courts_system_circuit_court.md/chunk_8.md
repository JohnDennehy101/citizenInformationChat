###  Limited Jurisdiction

The Constitution specifies that all non-minor offences must, in general,
involve a trial with a jury.

All minor criminal cases are heard in the District Court summarily (i.e.,
without a jury). The Circuit Court has the jurisdiction to hear all non-minor
offences, except murder, rape, aggravated sexual assault, treason, piracy and
related offences.
