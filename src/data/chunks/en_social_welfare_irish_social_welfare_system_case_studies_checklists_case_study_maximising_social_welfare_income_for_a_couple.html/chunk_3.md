###  Answer

In the case of Mary and John, you must do 4 separate calculations to find out
which social welfare payment or combination of payments will maximise their
income.

You must calculate their social welfare entitlement based on the 4 following
situations:

  1. John claims JA for the whole family – see ‘Assessment 1’ below 
  2. Mary claims JB for the whole family – see ‘Assessment 2’ below 
  3. John claims JA and Mary claims Working Family Payment (WFP) – see ‘Assessment 3’ below 
  4. John and Mary claim separate social welfare payments: John claims JA and Mary claims JB – see ‘Assessment 4’ below.
