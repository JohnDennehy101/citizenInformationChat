##  Personal pensions

You may prefer not to join an occupational pension scheme, or you may not have
the option to (for example, if you are self-employed or your employer does not
offer such a scheme). In these cases, you can save for retirement by choosing
a different type of pension plan. These are usually known as personal pension
plans or private pension plans and are managed by a life assurance or
investment company.

The two main types of personal pension plan are:

  * A Personal Retirement Savings Account (PRSA) is like an investment account that you use to save for your retirement 
  * A Retirement Annuity Contract (RAC) is a type of insurance contract that provides pension benefits when you retire 

If your employer offers a PRSA rather than an occupational pension, they must
deduct contributions from your salary and send these payments to the PRSA
provider. The employer may also contribute to the PRSA but does not have to.
