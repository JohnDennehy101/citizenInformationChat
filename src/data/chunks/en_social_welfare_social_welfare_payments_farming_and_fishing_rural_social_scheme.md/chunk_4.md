###  How many hours' work is involved?

You work 19.5 hours per week. These hours are based on a farmer and fisher-
friendly schedule. This is to ensure participation does not affect your
farming/fishing activities. If you get a place on RSS, you are offered a
contract from your start date up to the following 31 March. You may be
considered for a further term following the initial contract, if you continue
to meet all the criteria for RSS.

The local management decides on your application. On 29 June 2022, the 6-year
time limit for participants on RSS was removed.

If you are eligible for RSS but donâ€™t wish to participate, your dependent
spouse, civil partner or cohabitant may take the available place. However,
this is only if neither of you are participating in any other similar scheme,
for example, the Community Employment Scheme. The Rural Social Scheme operates
independently of the [ Community Employment Scheme (CE)
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/employment/unemployment-and-
redundancy/employment-support-schemes/community-employment-scheme/) .
