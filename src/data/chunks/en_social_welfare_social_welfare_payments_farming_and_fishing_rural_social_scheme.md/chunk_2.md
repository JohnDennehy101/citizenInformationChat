##  Introduction

The Rural Social Scheme (RSS) is aimed at low-income farmers and fishermen and
fisherwomen. To qualify for RSS you must be getting a social welfare payment.
People participating in RSS provide services that benefit rural communities.

The Department of Social Protection (DSP) has overall responsibility for the
Rural Social Scheme, including eligibility criteria. The Department monitors
the implementation of RSS and supports the organisations that manage RSS
locally.

The Department may also inspect any scheme and visit projects. At a local
level, RSS is managed by implementing bodies such as local development
companies and in the Gaeltacht areas, by Údarás na Gaeltachta.
