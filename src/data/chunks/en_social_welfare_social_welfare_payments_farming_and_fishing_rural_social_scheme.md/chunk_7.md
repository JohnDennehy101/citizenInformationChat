####  **Criteria for a farmer**

You must provide proof that you are actively farming. To do this, you must
provide a copy of your application for the [ Basic Payment Scheme
](https://www.gov.ie/en/service/f16b22-basic-payment-scheme/) for the current
year, including a valid herd number. If you are actively farming and have not
applied for the Basic Payment Scheme, you should contact your local RSS
implementing body for advice.
