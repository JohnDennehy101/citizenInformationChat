####  Changes to your circumstances

The rules that apply to your original social welfare payment also apply to
your RSS payment. This means that, if your dependant gets a job, their income
will be assessed as means and your RSS payment may be reduced.

Your RSS payment cannot be reduced below the minimum rate of â‚¬259.50. To avoid
any possible overpayments, if there is any change in your circumstances, you
should inform your local RSS implementing body.
