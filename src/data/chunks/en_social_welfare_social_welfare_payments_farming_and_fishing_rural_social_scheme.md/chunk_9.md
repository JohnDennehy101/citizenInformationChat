####  **Spouse, civil partner or cohabitant of a farmer**

If you are eligible but do not wish to participate in RSS, your dependent
spouse, civil partner or cohabitant can take the available place.

Or, if your spouse, civil partner or cohabitant is getting one of the
qualifying social welfare payments and is actively farming, they can use your
herd number to qualify for RSS.

Your spouse, civil partner or cohabitant can participate in RSS, if they are
under 66 and you are getting a State Pension (Non-Contributory) which includes
an Increase for Qualified Adult for them.
