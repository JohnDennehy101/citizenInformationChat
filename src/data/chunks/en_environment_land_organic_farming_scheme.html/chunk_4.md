###  **Converting part of your farm for organic farming**

You donâ€™t have to convert your entire farm to organic farming. You can convert
part of it so long as you:

  * Use different species or varieties of crops to make sure that organic and non-organic crops can be told apart 
  * Use different species of livestock to make sure that organic and non-organic livestock can be told apart
