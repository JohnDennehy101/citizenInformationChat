##  How do I apply for the Organic Farming Scheme?

**The Organic Farming Scheme is currently closed to new applicants.**

When applications are open, you apply to the Organic Farming Scheme through
your [ Basic Income Support for Sustainability Scheme (BISS)
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/environment/land/basic-income-support-
for-sustainability-scheme-for-farmers/) application, which can be accessed on
agfood.ie.

In your BISS application, you declare the land parcels that will be part of
the OFS as either ‘in-conversion’ or ‘organic’.

Gov.ie have a useful [ step-by-step guide (pdf)

to help you complete your application.

You can also get a Farm Advisory System (FAS) approved advisor to apply for
OFS and other farming grants for you. A FAS advisor is someone who is
qualified to give farmers advice on a range of topics, including applying for
grants and schemes. You will have to pay the FAS advisor for this service. You
can find [ a farm advisor ](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/b41a6-farm-
