##  What is the Organic Farming Scheme?

**The Organic Farming Scheme is currently closed to new applicants.**

The Organic Farming Scheme (OFS) provides financial support to farmers to
encourage them to produce organic food.

Organic food is food produced using [ organic farming practices
](https://agriculture.ec.europa.eu/farming/organic-farming/organic-production-
and-products_en) , such as:

  * Not using synthetic fertilisers and pesticides 
  * Not using genetically modified organisms 
  * Following the highest standards of animal welfare 

The scheme also aims to reduce the environmental impact of farming and improve
animal welfare.

The scheme started in 2024 and runs for 5 years. It is available to farmers
who farm organic livestock or crops.

The amount you get is based on the amount of land you farm organically and
what you produce.
