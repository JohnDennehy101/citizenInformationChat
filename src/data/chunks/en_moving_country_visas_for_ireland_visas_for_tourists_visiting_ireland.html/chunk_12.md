##  Decisions and appeals

If you sent your application to Dublin, you can check [ visa decisions and
waiting times ](https://www.irishimmigration.ie/visa-decisions/) . If you sent
your application somewhere else, you can contact the embassy or consulate you
sent your documents to for updates on your application. Applications take
around 8 weeks, but may take longer.

If your visa application is successful, the visa office will post your
passport back to you with the visa attached. The visa will be valid for a
particular period. Having a visa does not guarantee that you will be allowed
to [ enter Ireland ](/en/moving-country/visas-for-ireland/permission-to-land-
in-ireland/) .
