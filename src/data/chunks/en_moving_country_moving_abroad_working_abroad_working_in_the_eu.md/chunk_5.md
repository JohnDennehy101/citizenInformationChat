###  Recognition of qualifications in the EU

The EU has set up [ systems for recognising diplomas and training
](http://europa.eu/youreurope/citizens/work/professional-
qualifications/index_en.htm) so you can use your training and skills in
another EU country. The basic principle is that if you are qualified to work
in your profession in your home country, you are qualified to work in that
profession in any other EU country.
