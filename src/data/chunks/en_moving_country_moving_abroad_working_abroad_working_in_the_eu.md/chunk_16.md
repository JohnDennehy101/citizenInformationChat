###  Health entitlements

The [ European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) ](/en/travel-and-
recreation/travel-abroad/european-health-insurance-card/) replaced forms such
as the E111 and the E128, making it easier for you to get medical care quickly
and easily. It is evidence that you are part of a health insurance scheme
administered by another state in the EEA/Switzerland.

An [ S1 portable document (formerly E106)
](http://europa.eu/youreurope/citizens/work/social-security-
forms/index_en.htm) ensures that you have the same health entitlements in the
state to which you are being posted, as are available to nationals of that
state. Before you go to another EU state, you should contact the [ HSE
Overseas Section
](https://www2.hse.ie/contact/?utm_source=internal&utm_medium=search&utm_campaign=contact_us)
to get an S1.
