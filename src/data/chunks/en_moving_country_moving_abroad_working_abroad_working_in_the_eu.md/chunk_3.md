##  EU Directives on free movement ofworkers

If you are an EU citizen moving to another EU country to take up employment or
self-employment or to provide a service, the [ EU Directives on the free
movement of workers ](/en/government-in-ireland/european-government/european-
union/freedom-of-movement-in-the-eu/) cover you. Certain members of your
family, whatever their nationality, have the right to accompany you or to join
you in your country of employment.

Your ‘qualifying’ family is:

  * Your spouse or civil partner 
  * Your child or the child of your spouse under the age of 21 
  * Your grandchild or your spouse’s grandchild under the age of 21 
  * Your dependent parent, or dependent parent of your spouse 
  * Your dependent grandparent, or the dependent grandparent of your spouse 
  * Other direct, dependent descendants or direct, dependent relatives in the ascending line (for example, great grandparents or great grandchildren) of either you or your spouse 

Children over 21 are generally considered qualifying family members if they
are in education or are dependent on you due to an illness or disability. You
will have to show that your parents or grandparents (or the parents or
grandparents of your spouse) were dependent on you before they came to
Ireland.

Other family members do not have an absolute right of residence but may be
permitted to live with you in another EU country. Permitted family members
include:

  * Your partner 
  * Any relative who is part of your household that is not a qualifying family member 
  * Any relative who needs your personal care because of illness or disability 

Your spouse, civil partner and children also have the right to work in your
country of employment. You and your family members have the right to the same
social benefits as citizens of the host member state. This includes the right
to access education and benefits.

Members of your family who come from a non-EU country may be asked for an
entry visa by the country you are working in. This visa is usually granted
quite easily and should be free of charge.
