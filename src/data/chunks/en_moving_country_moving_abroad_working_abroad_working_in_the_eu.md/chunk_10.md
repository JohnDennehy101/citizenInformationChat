###  Taxes

If you live and work in another member state, you are likely to become
_resident for tax purposes_ there. Each country has its own definition of _tax
residence_ . You must comply with the laws of the country you are resident in.
You may be liable for taxation in more than one country.

In general, you are subject to income tax in the country you live in, but this
may not be the case if you are a _posted worker_ â€“ see 'Posted worker' below.
Property is taxed in the country in which it is situated but, again, there are
variations.

Tax agreements intended to avoid double taxation (if you get income from
different countries) are in place between most of the member states of the EU.

In general, national fiscal rules must respect the fundamental principle of
non-discrimination against nationals of another EU country.
