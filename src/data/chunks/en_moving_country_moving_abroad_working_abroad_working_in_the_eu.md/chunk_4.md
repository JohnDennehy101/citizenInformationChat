##  Access to employment

You can work under the same conditions as citizens of the country where you
are looking for work. You cannot be asked to meet any additional requirements.
This means that you can apply for any job vacancy advertised in any EU
country, including public sector jobs. However, certain public service posts
may be restricted to citizens of a particular country if the job involves
safeguarding public order or the interests of the state, for example, the
armed forces and police.
