###  Social insurance

If you are posted from Ireland to work in another EU state, you will usually
continue to pay your social security contributions in Ireland. You should
apply for an A1 (formerly E101) certificate which states that you are insured
for social security purposes in Ireland. This will exempt you and your
employer from paying social insurance in the country to which you are posted.

At least 4 weeks before you leave, you, or your employer, should apply for the
AI certificate. You can download the [ application form for an A1 (pdf)
](https://assets.gov.ie/69405/aa0f059f16814282915b065bb64dfe38.pdf) and it is
also available from the [ PRSI Special Collections Section of the Department
of Social Protection (DSP)
](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/3df362-operational-guidelines-prsi-prsi-
special-collection-system/) .

When you get the A1 certificate you will continue to pay your PRSI
contributions in Ireland. There are [ further details about PRSI and posted
workers ](http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/Social-Insurance-PRSI-for-Persons-
while-Working-Abroad.aspx) on the DSP website.
