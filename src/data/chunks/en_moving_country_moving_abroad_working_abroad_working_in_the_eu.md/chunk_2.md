##  EU citizens

If you are a citizen of the [ European Union (EU) ](/en/government-in-
ireland/european-government/european-union/european-union/) , you have the
right to live and work in any other EU country. You may need a valid identity
card or passport. If your family are not citizens of the EU or EEA, they may
need a visa before travelling.

You can be refused entry or your right of residence in another member state
can be restricted on grounds of public policy, public security, or public
health.

The rights outlined here also broadly apply to non-EU States in the European
Economic Area (Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein) and Switzerland.

If you are an Irish Citizen you can live and work in the UK under the [ Common
Travel Area ](/en/government-in-ireland/ireland-and-the-uk/common-travel-area-
between-ireland-and-the-uk/) between the two countries. This is still the case
following [ the UK's exit from the EU ](/en/government-in-ireland/ireland-and-
the-uk/brexit-and-you/) .
