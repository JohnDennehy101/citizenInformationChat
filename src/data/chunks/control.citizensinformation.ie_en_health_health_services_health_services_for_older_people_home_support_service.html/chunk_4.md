###  Who can apply for the Home Support Service?

The Home Support Service is available to people aged 65 or over who may need
support to continue living at home or to return home following a hospital
stay. The services might be needed due to illness, disability or after a stay
in hospital or following rehabilitation in a nursing home.

In some cases, the service may be available to people younger than 65 who need
support. For example, people with early onset dementia or a disability.
