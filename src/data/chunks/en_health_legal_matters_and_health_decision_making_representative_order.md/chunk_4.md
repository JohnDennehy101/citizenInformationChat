##  Who can be a decision-making representative?

When choosing a decision-making representative for you, the court will
consider:

  * Your known wishes 
  * Your relationship and compatibility with the decision-making-representative 
  * If they are able to perform the role 
  * Any conflicts of interest they might have 

The person cannot be a decision-making representative if they:

  * Have been convicted of an offence against you or your child 
  * Are financially insolvent or have been convicted of an offence involving fraud or dishonesty (unless the agreement is about personal welfare decisions) 
  * Are the owner or a registered provider of a designated care or mental health facility where you live or the employee of such a person (unless they are your close relative) 

A decision-making representativeâ€™s appointment may also end if the
representative:

  * Is your spouse, civil partner or cohabitant and your relationship ends 
  * Becomes ineligible for one of the above reasons.
