###  Changing a decision-making representation order

You or your decision-making representative cannot change your decision-making
representation order. Only the court can change a decision-making
representation order. The court may change a decision-making representation
order following an application to the court by you, your decision-making
representative or any other person with a genuine interest in your welfare.
