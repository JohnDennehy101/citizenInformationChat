They will keep a [ register of all decision-making representation orders
](https://decisionsupportservice.ie/services/search-register) . Certain people
and organisations will be able to search the register if they have a good
reason to do so, for example, banks, lawyers and doctors. These people will
also be able to request a certified copy of the decision-making representation
order from the Decision Support Service.

The Decision Support Service will keep a record of anyone who searches the
register or receives a certified copy of a decision-making representation
order.
