##  Can I complete my own records?

If you (the employee) and your employer agree, you can:

  1. Complete your own [ OWT1 form (doc) ](https://www.workplacerelations.ie/en/Publications_Forms/Form_OWT1.doc) (or a similar form) each week 
  2. Give the completed form to your employer for them to sign 

Your employer must then keep the completed form so that it is available for
inspection by the Workplace Relations Commission.
