##  Records to be kept by your employer

Your employer should keep the following records:

  * Your name, address, [ PPS number ](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/personal-public-service-number/) , and a brief statement of your duties as an employee 
  * A copy of your [ contract of employment ](/en/employment/employment-rights-and-conditions/contracts-of-employment/contract-of-employment/)
  * Your total days and hours worked each week 
  * Any days and hours of [ leave ](/en/employment/employment-rights-and-conditions/leave-and-holidays/annual-leave/) you take each week (including annual leave and public holidays), and the pay you got for that leave 
  * Any additional pay for a [ public holiday ](/en/employment/employment-rights-and-conditions/leave-and-holidays/public-holidays/)
  * A copy of a ‘written record of a notification of working time’ (such as your weekly rota) 

Your employer must keep these records in a way that can be easily understood
by an inspector from the Workplace Relations Commission.
