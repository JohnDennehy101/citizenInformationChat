##  What is radon?

Radon is a naturally occurring radioactive gas that results from the decay of
uranium in rocks and soils. The gas is colourless, odourless and tasteless and
can only be measured using special equipment.

In the open air, radon is harmless. But in an enclosed space such as a house,
it may build up to an unacceptably high level. Radon from the ground enters
buildings mainly through cracks in floors or gaps around pipes or cables.

The [ Office of Radiological Protection is part of the Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA) ](http://www.epa.ie/radiation/) . It is responsible
for regulating, monitoring and advising on radiation matters. It assesses
radon levels and identifies areas likely to be radon hotspots.
