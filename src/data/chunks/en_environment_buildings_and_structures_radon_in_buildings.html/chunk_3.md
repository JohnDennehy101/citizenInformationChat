###  How is radon harmful?

in the air. When you inhale these particles, they give a radiation dose that
may damage your lungs.

Radon has been shown to be a cause of lung cancer. Remaining exposed to high
levels of radon in an enclosed area can increase your risk of lung cancer,
particularly if you smoke. You can [ find out more about the effect of radon
