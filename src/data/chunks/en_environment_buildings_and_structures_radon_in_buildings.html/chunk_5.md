##  How to fix high radon levels in my home

If the radon level in your home is over the national reference level of 200
Bq/m3, the EPA recommends taking action to [ reduce the level of radon in your
home ](https://www.epa.ie/environment-and-you/radon/fixing-a-radon-problem/) .
This is called ‘radon remediation’.

The two main methods of radon remediation are to:

  * Prevent radon entering your home from the ground underneath 
  * Remove the radon after it has entered your home 

In either case, you should have your home re-tested after the work has been
completed to ensure the radon level has dropped below 200 Bq/m3.

Radon remediation works may qualify for the [ Home Renovation Incentive scheme
](/en/housing/housing-grants-and-schemes/grants-for-home-renovations-and-
improvements/home-renovation-incentive/) .
