####  **Restricted-application courses**

Some courses are ‘restricted-application’ courses.

These courses have early assessment procedures, sometimes as early as
February. If you want to apply for such a course, you must include it in your
CAO application in time, so that the relevant higher education institution
(HEI) can arrange the early assessment.

This means you can’t make a late application. See the CAO’s [ calendar of
restricted-application tests and interviews
](http://www.cao.ie/index.php?page=testandinterviews) .
