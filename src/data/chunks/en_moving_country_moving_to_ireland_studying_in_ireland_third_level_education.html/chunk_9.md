###  The points system

Entrance to third-level education in Ireland is generally decided by
competition. At the end of their secondary school education, students sit the
[ Leaving Certificate exam ](/en/education/state-examinations/leaving-
certificate/) and their grades are converted into numerical points based on
scores in their 6 best subjects. These points are calculated and third-level
places are awarded on that basis. You can find more information in our
document on [ applications procedures and entry requirements
](/en/education/third-level-education/applying-to-college/application-
procedures-and-entry-requirements/) .
