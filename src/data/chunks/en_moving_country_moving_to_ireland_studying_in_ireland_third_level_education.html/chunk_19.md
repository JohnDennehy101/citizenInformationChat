###  Application deadlines for non-EEA nationals

If you are now, or have been in the past, resident outside the EEA, you may be
required to apply directly to the higher education institution (HEI). You need
to contact the admissions office of the HEI to enquire whether you should
apply through the CAO or directly to the HEI.

You should make your enquiries well before the closing date. If you are
applying to any other HEI you should apply through the CAO.
