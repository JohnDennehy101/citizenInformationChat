###  Mature students

A small number of places are retained for [ mature students
](/en/education/third-level-education/applying-to-college/third-level-courses-
for-mature-students/) , those over the age of 23. These places are designed to
improve access to third-level for adults who may not have sufficient points
from their Leaving Certificate to compete with school-leavers. If you are
interested in applying for one of these places, you should first contact the
college of your choice. Some colleges require you to apply through the Central
Applications Office and you must apply before 1 February of the year you start
your course.

There are a number of part-time and modular courses and distance education
options available if the full-time education option does not suit your
circumstances.
