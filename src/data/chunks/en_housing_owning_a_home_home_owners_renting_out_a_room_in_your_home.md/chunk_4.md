##  Renting out a room in your home

If the part of your home that you rent out is not self-contained, you are not
covered by landlord and tenant legislation, so the rights and responsibilties
under that legislation do not apply to you. For example, you do not have to
register as a landlord with the RTB and the accommodation does not need to
meet any [ minimum physical standards
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/housing/renting-a-home/tenants-rights-
and-responsibilities/minimum-standards-for-rented-homes/) .

A person renting a room in your home is living there under a license
agreement, not a tenancy agreement _._ This means that they are only entitled
to reasonable notice if you decide to terminate the agreement. However, they
can refer disputes under the [ Small Claims Procedure
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/justice/courts-system/small-claims-
court/) .

Your tenants can find out more about their rights in our page [ Sharing
accommodation with your landlord
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/housing/renting-a-home/tenants-rights-
and-responsibilities/sharing-accommodation-with-your-landlord/) . Threshold
also provides information and advice for people renting.
