###  Renting a room to a student

If you are renting a room to a student, there is a [ voluntary regulatory
framework ](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/be552-rent-a-room-voluntary-
regulatory-framework/) and a [ sample license agreement (pdf)
](https://assets.gov.ie/271051/4f23c2be-0953-4be0-9ce1-22e67cfa0a2b.docx) to
help set ground rules between you and the student. You should make a written
licence agreement before the student moves in.

Along with the ground rules listed above, the licence agreement also includes
the following:

  * How much the deposit will be 
  * The date the deposit will be returned to the student after the licence agreement has ended 
  * The possible reasons why you may keep part of the deposit, for example, unpaid rent or damage to property 
  * The method used to record that the rent has been paid 
  * A list of furniture, provided by the landlord, which the student has exclusive use of 
  * Any general rules about your access to the bedroom 

The licence agreement can be adjusted to suit the needs of the landlord and
the student.
