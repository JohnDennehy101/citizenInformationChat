##  Rules if you rent a room to someone getting the Housing Assistance Payment

The person renting a room in your home may qualify for the Housing Assistance
Payment (HAP). If they are applying for the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP),
you will need to provide certain information to the local authority. The local
authority will pay you HAP directly. This information includes:

  * The amount of the monthly rent 
  * Your bank account payment details 
  * An undertaking regarding the property’s compliance with standards for rental accommodation 
  * An undertaking regarding your tax compliance 
  * Proof that you own the property 

The local authority will inspect the property within 8 months of the first HAP
payment, unless the accommodation has already been inspected in the last 12
months. An inspector will check that the accommodation meets the [ minimum
physical standards for rental accommodation
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/housing/renting-a-home/tenants-rights-
and-responsibilities/minimum-standards-for-rented-homes/) .

You must show that your tax affairs are in order by producing [ evidence of
tax clearance ](https://www.revenue.ie/en/online-services/services/manage-
your-record/apply-for-tax-clearance-online-using-etc.aspx) from Revenue. Tax
compliance is checked in ‘real-time’ on [ Revenue’s electronic tax clearance
system ](https://www.revenue.ie/en/starting-a-business/tax-clearance/apply-
for-tax-clearance-certificate/index.aspx) .
