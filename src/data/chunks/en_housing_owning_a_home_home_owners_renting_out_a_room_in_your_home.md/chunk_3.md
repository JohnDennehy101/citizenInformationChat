##  Renting out a self-contained unit

If you rent out a self-contained unit in your home, such as a converted garage
attached to your home or a basement flat, the [ rights and responsibilities
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/housing/renting-a-home/landlords-
rights-and-responsibilities/landlords-rights-and-obligations/) of a landlord
under residential tenancies legislation apply. For example, you must [
register the tenancy ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/housing/renting-
a-home/landlords-rights-and-responsibilities/registering-a-tenancy/) with the
Residential Tenancies Board (RTB) every year and make sure that the
accommodation meets [ minimum physical standards
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/housing/renting-a-home/tenants-rights-
and-responsibilities/minimum-standards-for-rented-homes/) .

However, if the self-contained flat or apartment was originally part of the
main house, you can choose to opt out of **one** **requirement** of
residential tenancies legislation. This is the requirement that gives tenants
[ the right to stay in rented accommodation ](/en/housing/renting-a-
home/tenants-rights-and-responsibilities/types-of-tenancy/) for a set amount
of time. This exemption is available under [ Section 25 of the Residential
Tenancies Act 2004
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2004/act/27/section/25/enacted/en/html#sec25)
. You must give the tenant notice in writing, before the start of the tenancy,
if you want to opt out of the rules about [ security of tenure
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/housing/renting-a-home/tenants-rights-
and-responsibilities/types-of-tenancy/%22%20/l%20%22384575) .
