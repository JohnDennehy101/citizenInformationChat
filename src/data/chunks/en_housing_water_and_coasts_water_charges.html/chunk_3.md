###  When will excess use charges start?

The first bills for excess water usage will be issued after 1 January 2022\.

Irish Water has written to households that are using an excessive amount of
water and has given them information on how to conserve water and deal with
leaks. This gives people time to repair leaks and reduce their householdâ€™s
water usage before charges come in.
