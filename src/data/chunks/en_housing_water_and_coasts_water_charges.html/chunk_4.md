##  Who pays excess use charges?

The person who actually gets water and/or wastewater services from Irish Water
is liable to pay any excess use charges. This means that the occupier of the
property is liable for the excess use charge.

If you **own a property** , it is presumed that you are the occupier, unless
it is proven otherwise.

If you **rent a property** , you are the occupier.

Property owners must provide Irish Water with information on the occupiers of
the property within 20 days of the start of a tenancy.
