###  How is my water usage measured?

Your water meter measures the amount of water supplied to your home. The
amount of wastewater discharged is assumed to be the same as the amount of
water drawn from the mains supply.

If your property does not have a meter and is suspected of excess use, Irish
Water may look to install a meter or calculate your usage using alternative
technology. If excess usage is detected unmetered customers will be charged at
the cap (currently set at €500 per year for both water and wastewater
services) – unless a meter is installed.
