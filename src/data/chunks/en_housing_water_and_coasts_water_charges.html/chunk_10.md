###  Exemptions

In certain circumstances you may be allowed increased water usage, for
example, if:

  * There has been a change to the number of residents at the property (see ‘Water allowance’ above) – called an ‘additional occupancy allowance’ 
  * You have a medical need which increases your water usage – called a ‘medical need exemption’
