###  UK licences

If you hold a UK driving licence, you can drive in Ireland if you live in the
UK and are visiting Ireland. You can no longer drive on your UK licence if you
live in Ireland. A UK driving licence is regarded as a licence from a
recognised state for exchange purposes. See ‘recognised states’ below. You can
