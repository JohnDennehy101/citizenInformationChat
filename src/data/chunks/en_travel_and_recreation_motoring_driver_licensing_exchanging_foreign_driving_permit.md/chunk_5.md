##  Driving on a foreign licence in Ireland

If you have a driving licence issued by an **EU or EEA member state,** you can
drive in Ireland as long as your existing licence is valid. If you want to
exchange your driving licence for an equivalent Irish driving licence when it
expires, you must do so within 10 years of your driving licence expiring.
