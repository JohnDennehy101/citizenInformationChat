###  Research and development

Capital expenditure of €309 million is being made available to continue the
implementation of the Strategy for Science, Technology and Innovation (SSTI)
as part of the Government’s commitment to promoting a competitive, knowledge-
based economy. This provision will, among other things, continue to support
the work of Enterprise Ireland (€127 million) in driving innovation and
research and development (R& D) in companies, and will maintain the commitment
to world class research through the capital allocation of €179 million to
Science Foundation Ireland.

The R& D tax credit available to companies will increase from 20% to 25%.
