###  Families and children

There is no increase to Child Benefit. The rate payable to a child aged 18 is
reduced to half the usual rate (January 2009). From 2010, Child Benefit will
not be paid to a child aged 18.

For certain low income families affected by the change in the Child Benefit
for children aged 18, there will be a special separate compensatory payment of
€15 per week for children aged 18 years. This compensatory measure will end on
31 December 2010.

Early Childcare Supplement will be paid monthly instead of quarterly. The
period for which children qualify will be reduced from 0-6 years to 0-5 years
and 6 months.

Increase for a Qualified Child is raised to €26 (€2 increase) per week
(January 2009).

All Family Income Supplement (FIS) income thresholds increase by €10 per week
per child (January 2009).

Increase in the additional income disregard by €50 per week from €100 to €150
for Back School Clothing and Footwear Allowance (June 2009). Further
compensatory measures will be applied to the Back to School Clothing and
Footwear Allowance scheme for children aged 18 years. These arrangements will
apply until January 2011.
