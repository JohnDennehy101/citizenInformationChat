###  Secondary benefits

If you were getting Invalidity Pension and were entitled to [ Free Travel
](/en/social-welfare/extra-social-welfare-benefits/free-travel/) or [ Island
Allowance ](/en/social-welfare/extra-social-welfare-benefits/island-increase/)
, you can keep these if you qualify for Partial Capacity Benefit. You cannot
keep your Fuel Allowance.

You can also keep the [ Household Benefits Package ](/en/social-welfare/extra-
social-welfare-benefits/household-benefits-package/) but it will be means-
tested after the first 2 years and annually after that. The means test has a
weekly income limit. This limit is the maximum rate of State Pension
(Contributory) for your circumstances (this includes any dependents you may
have) plus â‚¬120. Your weekly income limit is then compared to your weekly
means in [ a means test ](http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/1103_Appendix-1.aspx)
.

If you were getting Invalidity Pension and a Living Alone Allowance (LAA) with
your Invalidity Pension (or you start to live alone while you are getting
PCB), your rate of PCB will be calculated on the basis of your Invalidity
Pension and your LAA. So, for example, if your restriction on capacity for
work is severe, your PCB payment will be 75% of your IP and LAA payment.

You should check with the [ Department of Social Protection
](https://www.gov.ie/en/collection/cb07d7-supplementary-welfare-allowance-swa-
list-of-offices-administering-swa/) to see how your [ Rent Supplement
](/en/social-welfare/supplementary-welfare-schemes/rent-supplement/) may be
affected by your participation in the Partial Capacity Scheme.
