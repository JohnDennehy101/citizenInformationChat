###  **If you are unable to work due to illness**

If you are getting Partial Capacity Benefit and you are unable to work for a
period of time due to illness, you should contact the Partial Capacity Section
– see ‘Where to apply’ below.

For short periods of illness (up to 8 weeks at a time), you can stay on
Partial Capacity Benefit, but your weekly rate can be increased to the full
Illness Benefit or Invalidity Pension personal rate.

For longer periods of illness (more than 8 weeks), DSP will reassess your
Partial Capacity Benefit claim and you may return to your Illness Benefit or
Invalidity Pension. If you become able for work again, you can contact DSP
about going back onto Partial Capacity Benefit.
