##  Who does temporary protection apply to?

The European Council Decision lists who must be granted protection, and may
also include other categories of people who member states can give protection
to, if they choose to do so.

The [ European Council Decision on 4 March 2022 ](https://eur-
lex.europa.eu/legal-
content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv%3AOJ.L_.2022.071.01.0001.01.ENG&toc=OJ%3AL%3A2022%3A071%3ATOC)
, which introduced temporary protection following Russiaâ€™s invasion of
Ukraine, applies to Ukrainian nationals living in Ukraine who were displaced
on or after 24 February 2022.

It also applies to non-Ukrainian citizens who were living in Ukraine before 24
February with their Ukrainian family.

People who were living in Ukraine before 24 February as refugees, or with
another form of international protection, or as a stateless person can also
benefit from temporary protection. Family members of these groups are included
if they lived in Ukraine before 24 February.

The Decision also says that people who were legally living in Ukraine before
24 February 2022 and who cannot safely return to their own country can benefit
from temporary protection, or some other form of protection. The Decision
gives EU member states discretion about how to do this.

People with short term residence in Ukraine (for example, people on a student
visa) may also be granted temporary protection if they are unable to return to
their country of nationality. They should be allowed enter the EU on
humanitarian grounds, without the usual documentation, to make sure that they
can travel home safely.
