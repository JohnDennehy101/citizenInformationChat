###  Family reunification

EU member states must allow immediate family members to reunite where
possible. Immediate family members are:

  * Spouses and partners 
  * Dependent children 
  * Other relatives who lived with the person before the events that led to the mass influx, as part of a family unit and were dependent on them at the time
