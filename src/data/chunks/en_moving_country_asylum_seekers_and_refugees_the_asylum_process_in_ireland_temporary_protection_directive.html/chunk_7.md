###  Refusals of temporary protection

Ireland can refuse temporary direction to a person if:

  * There are serious reasons to consider that they have committed a war crime, a crime against peace, or a crime against humanity, or they have been found guilty of acts against the principles of the United Nations 
  * There are reasonable grounds to believe they are a danger to the security of the State 
  * They were convicted of a serious crime and the Minister for Justice believes they would be a danger to the community 
  * There are reasons to believe that they have committed a serious non-political crime before coming to Ireland
