###  **Recycling centres**

Recycling centres are also staffed and have specific opening hours but accept
a smaller variety of items than civic amenity sites. In general, they do not
accept very bulky items. They are not custom-built and tend to be located on
existing sites such as local authority depots.

You can get recycling advice and information from staff at your local
recycling centre and they may also sell home composting bins.
