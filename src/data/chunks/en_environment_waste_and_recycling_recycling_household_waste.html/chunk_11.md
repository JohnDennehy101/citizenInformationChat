###  Paper coffee cups

Paper coffee cups are sometimes made of compostable material. If your paper
cup is certified as compostable, it will say this on the cup and should be
placed in your brown bin at home. Otherwise, it should be put in the general
waste bin. You should check the lid and the sleeve of the coffee cup to see if
these can be recycled.
