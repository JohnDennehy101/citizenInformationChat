###  Planning permission

If you are renting out a property, or a room in your property for short-term
lets, you may have to apply to your local authority for planning permission to
change the use of the property, so it can be used for tourism and short-term
letting purposes.

This requirement for planning permission only applies to homeowners in [ Rent
Pressure Zones (RPZs) ](https://onestopshop.rtb.ie/rent-pressure-zones) who:

  * Let out their entire home (principal private residence) for short-term lets of more than 90 days in total while they are away. (Your principal private residence is the place where you ordinarily live). 
  * Let out a second property for short-term lets. 

It is unlikely that planning permission for short-term lets will be granted in
areas of high housing demand, where there is high rent inflation, insufficient
supply and lots of applications.
