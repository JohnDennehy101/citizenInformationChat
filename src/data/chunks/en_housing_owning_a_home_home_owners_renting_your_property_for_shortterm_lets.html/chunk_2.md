##  What is a short-term let?

A short-term let is when you rent out your property or a room in your property
for people to stay there for less than 14 days at a time. For example, if you
rent out your property on a booking website such as Airbnb so people can stay
there for a weekend.

If you rent out your property to visitors for short-term lets, you may need to
get planning permission from your local authority or apply for an exemption.
This also applies if you are renting a room in your property for short-term
lets.

The short-term letting [ regulations
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2019/si/235/made/en/pdf) were introduced
in July 2019. They aim to bring properties used for short-term tourist
lettings in [ Rent Pressure Zones (RPZs) ](https://onestopshop.rtb.ie/rent-
pressure-zones) back to the long-term rental market. These regulations will
continue as long as RPZs are in place.
