###  Applying for planning permission

If you need to get planning permission you fill in a planning permission form,
which is available on your [ local authority's website
](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/942f74-local-authorities/) . Submit the
completed form and the required documents to the Planning Department of your [
local authority ](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/942f74-local-authorities/)
. For new short-term letting use you should apply for planning permission,
whereas for existing unauthorised use you must apply for retention permission.
It normally takes about 8 weeks to process an application.

When making its decision on a planning application about short-term letting
the planning authority will take a number of things into account, such as
whether the area is experiencing high housing demand, high rent inflation,
insufficient supply and lots of planning applications for short-term lets. It
should be noted that if this is the case, it is unlikely that planning
permission will be granted.

You can [ appeal a planning permission decision ](/en/housing/planning-
