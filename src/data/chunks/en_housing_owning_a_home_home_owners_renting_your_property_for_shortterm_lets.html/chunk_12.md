###  **How is income from short-term lets taxed?**

The income you make from short-term lets is not considered to be rental income
for tax purposes. This is because your visitors use your accommodation as
guests rather than tenants.

This income is taxed as:

  * Other income, if the income is occasional 
  * Trading income, if you are trading as an ongoing business, such as a bed and breakfast or a guesthouse 

The tax office can answer any queries you may have and will help if you have
any difficulties completing the form. Find more information in our document on
‘ [ How to comply with your tax obligations ](/en/money-and-tax/tax/income-
tax/tax-return-non-paye-income/) ’ or on [ revenue.ie

income/index.aspx) .
