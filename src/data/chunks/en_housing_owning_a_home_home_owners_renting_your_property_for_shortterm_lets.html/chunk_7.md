###  Exemptions from the planning permission requirements

You do not have to apply for planning permission if:

  * Your property is not in a [ Rent Pressure Zone (RPZ) ](https://onestopshop.rtb.ie/rent-pressure-zones)
  * Your property is in an RPZ, but you let rooms or the entire property out for 15 days or more at a time 
  * Your property already has planning permission to be used for tourism or short-term letting purposes 
  * Your property is used for corporate or executive lets. For example, lettings provided for people coming to Ireland under employment contracts. 
  * You rent your property out under the [ rent-a-room scheme ](/en/housing/owning-a-home/home-owners/renting-a-room-in-your-home/)
  * You are ‘home-sharing’. Home-sharing is where a homeowner rents a room or rooms in their principal private residence for short-term lets while they are also occupying it. (In this situation you can offer unlimited short-term lettings for less than 14 days at a time.) 
  * You rent out your entire principal private residence for short-term visitors for less than 90 days a year while you are temporarily away. The 90 days do not have to be consecutive. 
  * The property is purpose-built student accommodation. (This accommodation generally has the required planning permission, which means accommodation is reserved for students during the academic year, but short-stays are allowed outside of term time.) 

**Note:** If you own an apartment or house in an RPZ that is not your
principal private residence and you rent it to students during the academic
terms, but want to use it for short-term lettings during the summer holidays,
you need to apply for planning permission from your [ local authority
](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/942f74-local-authorities/) .
