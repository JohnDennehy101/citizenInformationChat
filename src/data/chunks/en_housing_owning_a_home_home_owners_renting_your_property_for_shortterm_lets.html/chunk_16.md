###  Registering with the local authority

If you are offering short-term lettings in an RPZ area, but are exempt from
the planning permission requirement, you still need to register with the local
authority to avail of this exemption.

You must complete the following forms and provide any additional documents
needed and send them to your local authority within the required time limits.

  * **Form 15 – Start of year notification form.** This form should be sent to your local authority within 4 weeks of the start of each year, and no later than 2 weeks before the first short-term let of the year for that property. 
  * **Form 17 – End of year notification form.** This should be sent to your local authority between the 1 and 28 January of the year after the lettings have taken place. 
  * **Form 16 – 90 day threshold notification form.** This should only be sent to your local authority if you are a homeowner temporarily away from your home and reach the 90 day threshold during the year. You should submit the form no more than 2 weeks after the 90 day threshold has been reached. 

You will have to provide documentation proving that the property is your
principal private residence.

These registration forms are available on your [ local authority's website
](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/942f74-local-authorities/) and they can be
sent by email or post. [ Dublin City Council also has an online application
option ](https://www.dublincity.ie/residential/planning/planning-
