##  What is a school inspection?

All State primary and post-primary schools in Ireland are inspected by the
Department of Education on a regular basis. An inspection is carried out to
ensure that educational standards in schools are maintained.

The Department has a special division called the Inspectorate that carries out
school inspections. The [ Education Act (1998)
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1998/en/act/pub/0051/index.html) sets out the
responsibilities of the Inspectorate.

The Inspectorate

  * Evaluates and reports on the quality of education provision 
  * Inspects and evaluates education provision at primary and post-primary school 
  * Advises those working in the education system 
  * Contributes to the development of education policy 

The Inspectorate also evaluates the educational services for students with
special educational needs. This is separate to the role of the [ National
Council for Special Education ](http://www.ncse.ie/) (NCSE) which helps
improve co-ordination between education and health to provide special
education.

The [ Child and Family Agency ](https://www.tusla.ie/) is responsible for
assessing [ education provision for children who are not attending school
](https://www.tusla.ie/tess/information-for-schools/) .
