##  What types of school inspection are there?

The Inspectorate carries out inspections in schools and centres for education
and reports on these school inspections.

The inspections can include:

  * Curriculum evaluations 
  * Whole School Evaluation 
  * Child protection and safeguarding 
  * Follow-through inspections look at how the school has implemented inspection recommendations 

**Whole School Evaluations (WSE)**

Whole School Evaluations (WSE) are carried out in both primary and post-
primary schools. A WSE assesses the quality of school management, teaching and
learning at a school and assesses the school’s planning and self-review. The
inspectorate may hold pre-evaluation meetings with staff and management, meet
with the parents’ association and make school and classroom visits.

The inspectorate prepares a draft report and holds meetings with staff and
management before finalising and issuing the Whole School Evaluation.
