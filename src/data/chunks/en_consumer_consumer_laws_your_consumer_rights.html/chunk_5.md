##  Types of consumer contracts

When you buy goods, services and digital content, you make a contract with the
seller. As parties to the agreement, both you and the seller have certain
legal rights and obligations.

The main types of consumer contracts are:

  * [ Sales contracts ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/consumer/shopping/rights-when-buying-in-a-shop/) and [ online sales contracts ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/consumer/shopping/shopping-online/)
  * [ Contracts for services ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/consumer/buying-services/)
  * [ Digital content services or contracts ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/consumer/buying-digital-content-and-services/)

Contracts can be made verbally, in writing, or by your conduct (for example, a
silent contract where you pay for a good at a self-service supermarket
checkout).

Certain terms can be set by the businesses (for example the price or how a
service is carried out). However, these terms must not go against your
consumer rights.
