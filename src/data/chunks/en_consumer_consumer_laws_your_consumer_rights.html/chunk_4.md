##  Who are consumers?

Consumer laws only apply to transactions between a _consumer_ and a _trader._

A consumer buys goods or services for personal use.

A trader sells goods or services as a business, trade or profession.

Consumer law does not apply when buying from:

  * A private individual who is not a trader (for example, someone selling you their car but who does not sell cars as a profession). 
  * A seller outside the EU or _European Economic Area_ (Norway, Iceland, and Liechtenstein).
