##  Right to change your mind and cancel

You have a right to change your mind and cancel when you buy online, over the
phone, by mail order or on your doorstep (known as _distance contracts_ ).

With distance contracts, you do not enter into the contract in person and you
cannot check the products or service before you buy. For this reason, you have
a ‘ _cooling off period_ ’ where you can change your mind and get a refund.

The cooling off period ends 14 days after you receive the goods or service.
For [ doorstep sales
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/consumer/shopping/buying-from-a-
doorstep-seller/) , you have 30 days from when the contract was agreed to
cancel.

Sometimes you do not have a cooling-off period and the seller must tell you
this before you buy. Read more about [ shopping online

The European Consumer Centre Ireland has a useful [ letter template for
returning products bought online within the cancellation period
