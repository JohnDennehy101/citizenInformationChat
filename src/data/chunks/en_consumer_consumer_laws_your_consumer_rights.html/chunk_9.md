##  Unfair terms

Contract [ terms and conditions
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/consumer/consumer-laws/terms-and-
conditions/) must be fair and clear. A term is unfair if you are at an unfair
disadvantage.

Consumer law sets out terms that **may be unfair** (the ‘ **grey list** ’) and
ones that are **always and automatically unfair** (the ‘ **blacklist** ’).

There are legal tests of the transparency and fairness of contract terms. It
is up to the seller to prove that terms are transparent and fair.
