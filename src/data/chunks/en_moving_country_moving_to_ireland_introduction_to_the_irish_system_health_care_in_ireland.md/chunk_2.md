##  Public health care for people coming to Ireland

If you are a national of the [ European Economic Area (EEA)
](http://www.inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/Pages/eu-eea-countries) , the UK or
Switzerland, or if you are normally resident in Ireland, you are entitled to
receive the same level of health care as Irish citizens. Depending on your
income, you may be eligible for a [ medical card ](/en/health/medical-cards-
and-gp-visit-cards/medical-card/) , which entitles you to the full range of
medical services at no cost.

If you are not from an EEA member state or Switzerland, you will be entitled
to certain services free of charge and you will have to pay for the remainder.
