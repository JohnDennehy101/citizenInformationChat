##  Private health care for people coming to Ireland

In addition to the public health system, people in Ireland can avail of a
range of private health care services. You must pay the full costs of
treatment if you opt for private health care.

There are a number of [ private health insurance ](/en/health/health-
system/private-health-insurance/) companies in Ireland. Providers include [
VHI Healthcare ](https://www.vhi.ie/) , [ Laya Healthcare
](https://www.layahealthcare.ie/) , [ Irish Life Health
](http://www.irishlifehealth.ie/) and [ HSF Health Plan ](http://www.hsf.ie/)
. As long as you are from the EEA or Switzerland or normally resident in
Ireland, you are entitled to the same benefits from your private health
insurance with any of these companies as any other Irish citizen.

Up to €1,000 for adults and €500 for children of your private health insurance
premium attracts [ tax relief ](/en/money-and-tax/tax/income-tax-credits-and-
reliefs/taxation-and-medical-expenses/) at the standard rate (20%). This tax
relief is deducted at source by the health insurance provider.
