##  Rules

To be eligible to make voluntary contributions you must:

  * Have at least **520 PRSI** contributions paid under compulsory insurance in either employment or self-employment 
  * Apply to make your voluntary contribution within 60 months (5 years) of the end of the last completed tax year (contribution year) during which you last paid compulsory insurance or you were last awarded a credited contribution. (Since February 2017, the time limit for making voluntary contributions was extended from 12 months to 60 months.) 
  * Agree to pay voluntary contributions from the start of the contribution week that follows the week in which you leave compulsory insurance 

The contribution year is the same as the income tax year so it runs from
January to December.

You cannot use contributions paid in Class J to satisfy these conditions.
However, you may pay PRSI at Class J and voluntary contributions at the same
time.

You **stop paying voluntary contributions** when you start claiming a State
Pension or reach 70 years of age or start paying PRSI again.
