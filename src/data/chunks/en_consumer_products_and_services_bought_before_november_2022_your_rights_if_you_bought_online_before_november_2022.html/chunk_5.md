###  Extra rights

When you bought goods online, you entered into a contract called a _distance
contract._ A distance contract covers sales that were done online, over the
phone, by mail order, or from a door-to-door salesperson.

With this type of contract, you did not enter into the contract in person and
you could not check the products before you bought them. Because of this, you
have extra protections under EU law.
