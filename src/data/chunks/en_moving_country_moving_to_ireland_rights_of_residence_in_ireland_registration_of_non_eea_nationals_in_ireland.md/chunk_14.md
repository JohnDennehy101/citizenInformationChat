##  Travelling abroad

Non-EEA nationals who wish to travel abroad must have a valid IRP card to re-
enter Ireland. A soft copy of your IRP card is not acceptable for travel.

If you want to travel abroad, you should contact the country that you are
travelling to and find out about their requirements, such as the required
immigration permission and documentation.
