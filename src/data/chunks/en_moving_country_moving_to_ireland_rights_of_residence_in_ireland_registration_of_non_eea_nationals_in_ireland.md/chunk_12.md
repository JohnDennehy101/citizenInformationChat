###  What happens after I register?

Following registration with immigration officials, you will be issued with an
Irish Residence Permit (IRP) by post.

You must carry your card with you at all times and show it to an immigration
officer or the Garda Síochána if requested.

If you change your address, or change your name, you should email [
immigrationsupport@justice.ie ](mailto:immigrationsupport@justice.ie) .
