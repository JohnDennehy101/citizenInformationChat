##  Immigration stamps

As well as your Irish Residence Permit (IRP), you will also receive a [ stamp
in your passport ](http://www.inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/Pages/registration-stamps) ,
which specifies the duration and the conditions of your permission to remain
in Ireland. If you are renewing online, you will not receive a stamp in your
passport.
