##  Who has to register with immigration?

You must register if you plan to stay in Ireland for over 3 months and you:

  * Are 16 or over 
  * Are a citizen of a country outside the EEA (this is the EU and Norway, Iceland and Lichtenstein), Switzerland and the UK 
  * Have received permission to remain in Ireland 

If you are living in Ireland already and are about to turn 16, you must
register with ISD.
