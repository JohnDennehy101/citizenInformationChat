###  Permission to remain

You may have already applied to ISD for permission to remain in the State and
received a letter granting your permission. This could be because you have:

  * Refugee or subsidiary protection status following an [ application for international protection ](/en/moving-country/asylum-seekers-and-refugees/the-asylum-process-in-ireland/applying-for-refugee-status-in-ireland/)
  * Leave to remain following an application for international protection 
  * Permission to remain in Ireland as the family member of an EEA national 
  * Permission to remain in Ireland as the family member of an Irish citizen 
  * Permission to remain as the parent of an Irish citizen child 
  * Any other permission to remain that was made by application while you were in Ireland 

You should bring the letter you got from ISD with you when you go to register.
