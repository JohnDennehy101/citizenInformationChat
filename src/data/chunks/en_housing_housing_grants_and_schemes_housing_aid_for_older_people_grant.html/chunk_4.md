##  Do I qualify for the grant?

This means-tested grant is paid for essential work to privately-owned homes
where the older person either:

  * Owns the home, or 
  * Has a right to live in the home where the work will be done 

Your total gross household income is assessed to find out if you qualify for
the grant and what level of assistance you can get.

Household income is the gross annual income earned by:

  * All adults living in the home aged over 23 years (or over 18 and not in full-time education) 
  * The registered property owner and their spouse. (This income is not considered if your home is rented from a landlord, provided by an approved housing body (AHB) or is a communal residence.) 

The following is not taken into account when calculating your household
income:

  * €5,000 for each member of the household aged under 18 
  * €5,000 for each member of the household aged between 18 and 23 and in full-time education 
  * €5,000 if a relative is caring full-time for the person who the grant is for
