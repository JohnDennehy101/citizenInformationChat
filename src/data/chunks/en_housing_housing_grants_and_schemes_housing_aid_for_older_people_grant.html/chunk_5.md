##  How much is the grant?

The grant covers **some** of the cost of work needed, but not all of it. The
amount of money you get depends on your gross household income for the
previous tax year after any disregards and deductions are applied. The maximum
grant available is €8,000 or 95% of the cost of the work approved by your
local authority.

This maximum grant of 95% is available to people with annual household incomes
of less than €30,000. This reduces to 30% for those with annual household
incomes of €50,001 to €60,000. The following table shows the current rates.

**Maximum yearly household income** |  **% of costs** |  **Maximum grant**  
---|---|---  
Up to €30,000  |  95%  |  €8,000   
€30,000 - €35,000  |  85%  |  €6,800   
€35,001 - €40,000  |  75%  |  €6,000   
€40,001 - €50,000  |  50%  |  €4,000   
€50,001 - €60,000  |  30%  |  €2,400   
**Over €60,000** |  |  **No grant payable**  
  
**Example**

If your gross household income for the previous tax year is €45,000 after the
disregards and deductions are applied, your grant is 50% of the costs of the
work to a maximum of €4,000. This means that if the work on the home costs
€10,000 including VAT, the grant will only be €4,000 and not €5,000.

**A grant is not available if the household income is more than €60,000, after
the disregards and deductions are applied.**
