##  Children

Married parents are automatically joint guardians of their children.
Separation or divorce does not change this. However, separation and divorce do
have implications for [ custody and access to children ](/en/birth-family-
relationships/separation-and-divorce/separation-and-divorce-children/) , and
financial matters such as [ maintenance ](/en/birth-family-
relationships/separation-and-divorce/maintenance-orders-and-agreements/) and
the [ family home ](/en/birth-family-relationships/separation-and-
divorce/family-and-shared-home/) .
