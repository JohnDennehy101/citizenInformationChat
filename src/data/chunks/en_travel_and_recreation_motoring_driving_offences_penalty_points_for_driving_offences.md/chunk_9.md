###  What happens if someone else was driving my vehicle?

If the driving offence was detected by camera, the notice is sent to the
registered owner of the vehicle. If the registered owner was not driving at
the time of the offence they should fill out the form attached to the notice,
giving details of the person who was actually driving. This should then be
returned to the Fixed Charge Processing Office with the original notice. **Do
not enclose payment** . The Garda√≠ then issue a notice to the driver.
