###  Can penalty points be cancelled?

If you have been issued with penalty points (or a fixed charge without penalty
points), you can apply to the Gardaí for the points to be cancelled. You will
have to show that there are good **procedural** or **exceptional** grounds for
cancellation.

**Procedural grounds** \- examples of this include:

  * A technical problem meant that wrong information was recorded (for example, the wrong speed limit was detected) 
  * You are exempt from the offence, for example, you have an exemption from wearing a seatbelt. See [ our document on seatbelts ](/en/travel-and-recreation/roads-and-safety/seatbelts-when-motoring-in-ireland/) ) 
  * You have been penalised for not having tax or insurance, but you can show that you had motor tax or insurance at the time of the alleged offence 
  * The car had been stolen and you have been sent a fixed charge notice and/or penalty points for offences committed after the theft of the vehicle 
  * You no longer owned the vehicle 

**Exceptional grounds** – examples of this include

  * You broke the speed limit because you were bringing someone to the hospital 
  * You broke the speed limit because you were responding to an emergency in your home (for example, a fire or gas leak)
