##  Introduction

Ireland uses penalty points to enforce the [ rules of the road
](https://www.rsa.ie/services/learner-drivers/resources/rules-of-the-road) and
improve road safety. If you commit a [ motoring offence ](/en/travel-and-
recreation/motoring/driving-offences/driving-offences/) , and the penalty for
the offence includes penalty points, your driving licence will be endorsed
with one or more penalty points.

Some traffic offences have other penalties, such as fines as well as penalty
points.

The penalty points system for driving offences has operated in Ireland since
2002. The law governing penalty points is the [ Road Traffic Act 2002
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2002/en/act/pub/0012/index.html) . This
legislation has been amended a number of times to add offences for which
penalty points can be issued.

While penalty points are endorsed on your driving licence, the points do not
physically appear on the licence. Your penalty points are recorded on your
driving licence record, which is held on the National Vehicle and Driver File
operated by the Department of Transport.

Penalty point endorsements remain on your licence record for 3 years and must
be notified to your insurance company when applying for motor insurance. Motor
insurance companies have had access to the National Vehicle and Driver File
since 2014.

Endorsements on your licence record will often lead to an increase in your
motor insurance premium.
