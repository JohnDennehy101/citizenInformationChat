Contact your [ local authority
](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/942f74-local-authorities/) to make an
appointment with the Housing Officer. They will assess if you qualify for this
scheme or for other housing supports.

rental property. The Housing Agency will work with you and your landlord to
try and buy the property.
