##  What is the Cost Rental Tenant in Situ Scheme?

This scheme allows the [ Housing Agency ](https://www.housingagency.ie/) to
buy rental properties from private landlords who are selling, so the Housing
Agency can continue to rent these properties to the tenants who are living
there.

You can access the scheme if you are a private tenant who has received a valid
[ notice of termination ](/en/housing/renting-a-home/if-your-landlord-wants-
you-to-leave#lab681) and you are at risk of homelessness because your landlord
is selling.

If the Housing Agency buys your rented home from your landlord, the Housing
Agency will become your landlord. They will work with independent
organisations, such as [ approved housing bodies ](/en/housing/local-
authority-and-social-housing/approved-housing-bodies/) to manage and maintain
these homes.

You will pay the same rent that you paid your previous landlord. However, it
is intended that the scheme will move to a [ cost rental
](/en/housing/renting-a-home/help-with-renting/cost-rental-housing/) model in
the future, where rents would be lower than market rents.

The [ government announced this scheme ](https://www.gov.ie/en/press-
release/6ab3a-government-counter-motion-on-the-private-members-business-
motion-re-eviction-ban/) as part of measures intended to help people whose
tenancies ended when the winter eviction ban ended. It began on 1 April 2023.
