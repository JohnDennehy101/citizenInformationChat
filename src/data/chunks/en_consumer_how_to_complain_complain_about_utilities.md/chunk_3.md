##  What you should know before youcomplain

Suppliers of gas and electricity, and Uisce Éireann (previously called Irish
Water), must comply with rulebooks put in place by the CRU. These are called
the Supplier Handbook and the Water Customer Handbook. These handbooks require
suppliers to produce codes of practices that cover a number of areas including
complaints handling.

Under the Codes of Practice for complaint handling, energy suppliers and Uisce
Éireann (previously called Irish Water) must:

  * Explain what went wrong, and apologise or give compensation (or both) if appropriate 
  * Have a procedure in place so complaints can be escalated 
  * Resolve complaints within 2 months 
  * Provide you with written notice that the complaint has been closed, once it has been resolved 
  * Inform you of your right to refer the complaint to the CRU if required 
  * Accept complaints from agencies or third parties acting on your behalf 

Uisce Éireann (previously called Irish Water) is also required to respond to
your complaint within 5 working days with a resolution or an outline of the
steps it will take to resolve the issue.

Every energy company (and Uisce Éireann (previously called Irish Water)) must
have a customer charter, with information about the level of service you
should expect, and what the company will do if something goes wrong. This must
be published on the company’s website.

The CRU has links to various suppliers on its [ list of energy suppliers' page
