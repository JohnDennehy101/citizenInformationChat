###  Final decision

If the CRU upholds your complaint, it may tell the energy supplier or network,
or Uisce Éireann (previously called Irish Water), to fix the problem or pay
compensation, or both. If compensation is awarded, it must be paid:

  * Within 14 days, or 
  * Within one billing period if it is in the form of credit to your account 

The CRU’s decision is binding on the supplier or network operator. However, it
is not bindng on you. If you are not happy with the decision made by the CRU,
you may consider taking court action through the [ small claims procedure
](/en/justice/courts-system/small-claims-court/) .
