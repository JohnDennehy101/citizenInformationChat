###  Make an informal complaint

If you are not happy with your energy or Uisce Ã‰ireann (previously called
Irish Water) service, you might be able to resolve the matter quickly by
talking to the company.

For energy (gas and electricity) customers, contact your:

  * **Energy supplier** for issues such as billing, account problems, marketing or advertising, changing supplier or closing your account 
  * **Network operator** for issues such as a faulty meter, connection costs, emergencies, planned outages, or connection delays 

It is a good idea to keep notes of:

  * What happened, including dates and times of conversations 
  * The name of the person you spoke to 
  * What was agreed 

Having a record of conversations will make it easier for you if you cannot
resolve your complaint informally.
