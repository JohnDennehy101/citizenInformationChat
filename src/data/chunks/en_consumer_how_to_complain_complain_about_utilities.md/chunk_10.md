###  What happens then?

When the CRU receives information from both sides, it investigates the
complaint. The time it takes to investigate will depend on how complex your
case is.

The CRU send a proposed decision to both you and the company. Both you and the
company have 10 working days to respond with final comments or information. A
final decision is issued within 90 days of the CRU receiving your complaint
form.
