###  What happens after the complaint is lodged?

When the CRU receives your complaint form, it will:

  * Contact the energy supplier or network, or Uisce Éireann (previously called Irish Water) to confirm that you have completed their complaints process first. If you haven’t, they will tell you to do so. 
  * Ask the energy supplier or network, or Uisce Éireann (previously called Irish Water), to provide them with a report on their handling of the complaint 
  * Try to acknowledge your complaint within 5 working days 
  * Give you a unique reference number – you should use this in all future communication with the CRU
