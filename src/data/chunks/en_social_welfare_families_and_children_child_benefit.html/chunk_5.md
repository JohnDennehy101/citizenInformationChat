###  **What counts as full-time education?**

Full-time education includes primary and post-primary schools, further
education and training courses, and third-level courses.

However, full-time education does not include courses:

  * That are part of an employment, apprenticeship, or work experience programme 
  * Which arise from employment 
  * Where the period of paid work experience is more than the time spent in the classroom 
  * Run by Teagasc where, in an academic year, the period of work experience is more than the time spent in the classroom
