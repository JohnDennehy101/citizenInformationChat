###  **If your child is aged 16-18 and in full-time education**

If your child is 16, 17 or 18 and in full-time education, you will get Child
Benefit until June in each academic year.

In August, the Child Benefit section will send you an application form. You
must complete it when your child returns to full-time education in September.

Once your child returns to education in September, you will get a back-payment
of Child Benefit for July and August.

If your child turns 19 in July or August and returns to full-time education in
September, you will get a back-payment of Child Benefit up until the month
they turn 19.

If you don’t get a form in the post from the Child Benefit section, you can
download and complete [ Child Benefit form CB2 (pdf)
](https://assets.gov.ie/27240/b0ecba21ca62497581edabcc313955b2.pdf) in
September. See ‘How to apply for Child Benefit’ below.
