##  What is Child Benefit?

Child Benefit is a monthly payment to the parents or guardians of children
under 16.

You can also get Child Benefit for children aged 16, 17 and 18 if they:

  * Are in full-time education or full-time training, or 
  * Have a disability and cannot support themselves. 

Full-time education includes:

  * Primary and post-primary level 
  * Further education and training courses 
  * Third-level colleges and institutions (there are some exceptions – see ‘What counts as full-time education?’ below). 

You don’t pay tax on Child Benefit.
