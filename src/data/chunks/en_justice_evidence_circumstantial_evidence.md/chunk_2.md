##  Introduction

Circumstantial evidence is evidence of facts that the court can draw
conclusions from. For example, if an assault happened on O'Connell Street at
6.15pm, you can give evidence that you saw the accused walking down O'Connell
Street at 6pm. In that situation, you are giving the court circumstantial
evidence. The court can draw conclusions from the fact that the accused was on
O'Connell Street at 6pm, but you have not given evidence about whether the
accused attacked a person.
