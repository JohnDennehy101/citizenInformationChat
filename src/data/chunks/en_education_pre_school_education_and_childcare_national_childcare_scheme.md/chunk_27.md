###  Can I use any childcare provider?

Childcare providers must be registered with Tusla and have a National
Childcare Scheme contract with DCEDIY.

You can get a list of contracted childcare providers from the [ NCS website
](https://www.ncs.gov.ie/en/childcare-search/) .

You can also get information from your local [ City and County Childcare
Committee ](https://myccc.ie/) .
