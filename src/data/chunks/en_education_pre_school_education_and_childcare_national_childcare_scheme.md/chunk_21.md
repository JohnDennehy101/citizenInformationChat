##  National Childcare Scheme Rates

Your reckonable income must be less than €60,000 per year to qualify for an
income-assessed subsidy. You are entitled to the maximum subsidy rates if your
reckonable income is €26,000 or less. If your reckonable income is over
€60,000 you can still apply for a [ universal subsidy ](/en/education/pre-
school-education-and-childcare/universal-childcare-subsidy/) .

You can use the [ subsidy calculator ](https://www.ncs.gov.ie/en/childcare-
subsidy-calculator-input/) on the NCS website to help you work out what your
entitlement will be.
