####  **Change of income**

If your income suddenly changes for reasons outside your control (for example,
if you lose your job or your hours at work are reduced), you can apply for a
sudden change assessment. You can do this online at [ on the NCS website
](https://ncs.gov.ie/en/) or by post.

This does not apply if you choose to change your income (for example, by going
on a shorter working year or term-time working arrangement).

Your new income assessment is based on the 4 weeks immediately before your
application. Any subsidies awarded under a sudden change assessment are for 6
months only. After this, you must re-apply for a new subsidy.
