##  Am I eligible for the National Childcare Scheme?

You must meet certain conditions to be eligible for the NCS.

You or your current partner must be a parent of the child or acting in _loco
parentis_ (this means acting as a parent to the child).

Your child must be over 6 months and under 15 years of age (children aged 15
do not qualify).
