###  **What is reckonable income?**

If you are applying for an income-assessed subsidy, the rate you qualify for
depends on your _reckonable income_ .

Your reckonable income is the total amount of your net family income. This is
income from all sources (including most social welfare payments) **after**
tax, PRSI and USC have been deducted.

However, some social welfare payments and other _allowable items_ or
_allowable deductions_ are excluded from reckonable income under the NCS (see
‘What are allowable deductions?’ below).
