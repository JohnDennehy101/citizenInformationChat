####  **Manual method**

You can ask for your income to be assessed manually. You must provide
documents such as payslips or DSP declarations which show your income.

These are reviewed and assessed by Pobal (the scheme administrator). You can
get a full list of the documents accepted as proof of your income ( _income
proofs_ ) in Appendix 1 of the [ NCS policy guidelines (pdf)
](https://www.ncs.gov.ie/NCS_policy_guidelines.pdf) .

You must declare additional income, such as any maintenance you pay or
receive, any income that requires a Revenue Form 12, and any foreign income.
