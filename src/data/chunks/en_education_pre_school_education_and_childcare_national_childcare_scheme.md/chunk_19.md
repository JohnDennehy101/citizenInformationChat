###  **What is counted as family income?**

If you are **parenting alone** , only your reckonable income is calculated and
assessed. If you are living with another adult who is not your partner (such
as a parent or other relative), their income is not taken into account.

If you are **living with your partner** (such as a spouse, civil partner or
co-habitant) your combined reckonable income is assessed. Your partner’s
income will be included even if they are not your child’s parent or guardian.
If your partner is living apart from you temporarily their income is still
included.
