###  **What assessment period is used?**

Your income is normally assessed based on your reckonable income from all
sources for the previous tax year.

For the 2024 programme year, the previous tax year is 2023 (1 January 2023 to
31 December 2023).

You can choose to have the current year assessed if you believe your income
from the current year will be significantly less than your income from the
previous year. You may be asked to provide information to support this. Your
application is then manually reviewed and assessed.

Read more about current year assessments in the [ NCS policy guidelines (pdf)
](https://www.ncs.gov.ie/NCS_policy_guidelines.pdf) .

Self-declarations and supporting documents may be checked on a sample basis.
