###  How are work, study and training hours assessed?

Any part-time hours, casual working, or hours in labour activation schemes
such as Gateway and SOLAS programmes, are counted as work.

If you are studying for a higher education course on the National Framework of
Qualifications (NFQ), this is counted under studying and training.

You may be asked for proof of work, study or training. Read more about what is
accepted as proof of work, study or training in the [ NCS policy guidelines
(pdf) ](https://www.ncs.gov.ie/NCS_policy_guidelines.pdf) .
