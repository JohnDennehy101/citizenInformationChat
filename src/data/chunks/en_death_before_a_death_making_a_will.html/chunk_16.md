####  Joint bank accounts

If you have a joint bank account with your spouse, civil partner or child,
usually the surviving account holder will be fully entitled to the money in
the account when you die.

If you open a joint bank account with a relative or friend so that they can
help you manage your money and do not intend that person to own the money in
the account after you die, you should make this clear when you are opening the
account.
