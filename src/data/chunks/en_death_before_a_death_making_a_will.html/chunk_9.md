###  Signing your will

You have to sign your will in the presence of 2 witnesses. They have to sign
the will to _attest_ (witness) that you have signed the will.

If you are unable to sign your will because you cannot write, you can make a
mark that should be witnessed like a signature.

If you are physically disabled and are unable to sign or mark your will, you
can direct an agent or representative to sign your will for you. Your agent
must sign the will in your presence and on your direction and your two
witnesses must be present.
