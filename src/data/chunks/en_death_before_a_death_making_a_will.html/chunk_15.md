##  Common problems and disputes about wills

When you make your will, you should consider some common problems that result
in a gift made in a will being invalid.

  * The possession that you want to leave to someone may be lost or no longer exist at the time of your death. 
  * There is confusion about the identity of a beneficiary. For example, you leave a gift to your cousin, Jim, and you have two cousins named Jim. 
  * If the gift is not clearly identified in your will or it does not conform to its description in the will. 
  * If you leave a gift to a person who is a witness to your will, that gift will be invalid.
