##  How do I make a will?

You can write a will yourself, or have a solicitor write it for you.

A solicitor can advise you about your will and can make sure that your will is
legally valid. You may also need legal advice for more complicated inheritance
matters.

If you write your own will, you should make sure that it is valid. It can only
be valid if:

  * The will is in writing 
  * You are over 18 
  * You are of sound mind 
  * You sign or mark the will (or confirm that you made the signature or mark) in the presence of two witnesses, present at the same time if possible (the witnesses do not have to see the contents of the will). 
  * Your two witnesses sign the will in your presence 
  * Your signature or mark is at the end of the will 

Gifts left to a witness or their spouse or civil partner are not valid.
