##  Reasons for making a will

You do not have to make a will. If you die without making a will, your estate
will be distributed according to the law on succession - see ‘What happens if
you die without leaving a will’ below.

If you want to have a say over who inherits all or part of your estate, you
should make a will. You can also keep an updated list of the things that you
own and information that people may need after your death. You can use a form
like our form:

  * [ Where my possessions are kept (MS Word) ](/docs/form-where-my-possessions-are-kept.doc)
  * [ Where my possessions are kept (pdf) ](/docs/form-where-my-possessions-are-kept-pdf.pdf)

It will make it easier to identify and trace your possessions after you die.
You should keep the list in a safe place.
