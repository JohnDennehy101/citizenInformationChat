###  **What does being ‘of sound mind’ mean?**

In order to make a valid will, you must have, in the eyes of the law, the
_mental capacity_ to do so. This means you must understand and be able to
decide what you are doing. If you have a medical condition that could affect
your ability to understand and make decisions about what you should put in
your will, you should ask your doctor or specialist to certify that you are
capable of making a will.

For example, if you have a history of mental illness, or if you are in the
early stages of a condition that can affect your ability to think and
understand (like dementia for instance), you should ask your doctor or
specialist to certify that you are currently mentally capable of making a
will.
