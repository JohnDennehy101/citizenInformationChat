###  Provisions for your spouse, partner and dependents

Your spouse or civil partner has a ‘l _egal right share_ ’ to your estate.
This means that they are entitled to benefit from your will, even if you do
not provide for them in your will. Your children also may have entitlements.
Partners (that you were not married to or in a civil partnership with) may
also be able to claim a share of your estate.
