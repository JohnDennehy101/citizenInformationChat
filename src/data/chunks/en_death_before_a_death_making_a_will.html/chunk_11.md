###  Property abroad

If you have property in other countries, you should make a will in each of
those countries due to possible differences in succession law.

Under [ EU Regulation 650/2012 on matters of succession (Brussels IV)
](http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-
content/EN/TXT/?uri=cellar:57d89c1a-5220-4886-b7b5-6b140ce3cc85) , if you have
property in another EU member state, apart from Denmark, you can direct in
your will that the law of your nationality should apply to the property.
