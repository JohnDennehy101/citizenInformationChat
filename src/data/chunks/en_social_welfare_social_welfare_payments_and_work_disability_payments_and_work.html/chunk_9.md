##  FET training courses

If you are getting Disability Allowance or Blind Pension and take up a place
on a [ FET training course ](/en/education/further-education-and-
training/training-allowances/) you receive [ a training allowance
](/en/education/further-education-and-training/training-allowances/) at the
same rate as your social welfare payment. Your social welfare payment is
suspended when you are on the training course. You can return to your social
welfare payment when you leave the training course.

If you were getting Invalidity Pension or Illness Benefit, and take up a place
on a FET training course you will continue to get your full social welfare
payment including any increases you get for your dependents. You do not get a
training allowance or a training bonus. You must always apply for prior
written permission from DSP before you can take up a training course.

You can read more in our document on [ training allowances
](/en/education/further-education-and-training/training-allowances/) .

You retain any [ extra benefits ](/en/social-welfare/extra-social-welfare-
benefits/extra-social-welfare-benefits/) that you had before taking up the
course. You can read about how taking part in a training course may affect
your Rent Supplement in our document on [ Rent Supplement and changes to your
circumstances ](/en/social-welfare/supplementary-welfare-schemes/changes-to-
rent-supplement/) .
