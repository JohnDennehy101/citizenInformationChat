###  Step 5 â€“ Grant is paid

If the local authority is satisfied with the work when they inspect the home
and the charge document is signed, the grant will be paid.

If you got the grant to refurbish a home to rent out, the grant will not be
paid until you give the local authority evidence that you have registered the
tenancy with the RTB.

You will also need to submit proof to your local authority every year that you
have registered the tenancy with the RTB annually.

If you have questions about the grant, contact the [ Vacant Homes Officer in
your local authority ](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/f59b3-vacant-homes-
officer-contacts/) .
