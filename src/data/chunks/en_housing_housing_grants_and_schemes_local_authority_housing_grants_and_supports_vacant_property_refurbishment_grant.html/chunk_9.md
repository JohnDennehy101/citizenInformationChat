###  Step 2 – Application reviewed and processed

  * The local authority will review your application and documents. They may ask for further information or documents in certain cases. 
  * They will arrange for a qualified person to visit the property to check that it is possible to do the work and to assess the cost. 
  * The local authority will send you a ‘letter of approval’ if your application is successful. This letter will tell you how much your grant will be. If you haven’t bought the property yet, you will get a ‘letter of approval in principle’ for the grant. You must sign and return this letter to the local authority, as it forms part of your agreement with the local authority. 
  * You have 13 months to complete the works once your application has been approved
