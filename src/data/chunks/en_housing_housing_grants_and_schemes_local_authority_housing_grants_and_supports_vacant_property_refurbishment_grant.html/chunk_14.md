##  What happens if I don't want to live in the property or rent it out?

If you got the grant to refurbish a property to live in and then you decide to
sell or rent it out within 10 years of getting the grant, you will have to pay
the local authority back. You will have to pay them back for any reason that
you are no longer living in the property as your main home within 10 years of
getting the grant.

If you got the grant to refurbish a property to rent and you decide to sell
the property, or it is no longer available to rent within 10 years of getting
the grant, you will also have to pay the local authority back.

The amount you will have to repay depends on how long you’ve lived in the
property or rented it out. If you live or rent out your property for:

  * Less than 5 years, you have to repay the full amount 
  * Over 5 years but less than 10, you have to repay 75% of the grant 
  * More than 10 years, you don’t have to pay back anything
