and send it to the [ local authority
](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/942f74-local-authorities/) with your
supporting documents.

You will need:

  * Proof that the property is vacant. Utility bills can be used to show that a property has been vacant at a particular time. If you can’t get utility bills for the property, the local authority may accept a signed [ affidavit ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/justice/witnesses/affidavit/) stating that the property has been vacant for at least 2 years. Your local authority may also accept other documents that prove the property is vacant. **Your local authority checks this paperwork to verify that your documents fully prove that the property has been vacant. In certain cases, the local authority may ask you for more information to ensure they are fully satisfied that the home has been vacant.** Contact the [ Vacant Homes Officer in your local authority ](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/f59b3-vacant-homes-officer-contacts/) for more information on this. 
  * Proof that you own the property, or you are trying to buy it. 
  * Proof of planning permission, if it is needed. 
  * Proof that the property is derelict, if you are applying for the top-up grant. If the property is not already on the Derelict Sites Register, you will need a report from a qualified professional saying the property is derelict. 
  * A quote for the work. 
  * To sign that you agree to repay the local authority all or part of the grant, if you sell the home within 10 years of getting the grant, or if you rent it out when you had agreed to live there. 
  * To sign a declaration saying that the property will meet [ minimum standards for rental accommodation ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/housing/renting-a-home/repairs-maintenance-and-minimum-physical-standards/) if you are going to rent it out. 
  * A signed affidavit confirming that you haven’t got the grant before to refurbish a property to rent out.
