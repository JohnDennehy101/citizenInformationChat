You will be able to claim a [ Rent Tax Credit ](/en/housing/renting-a-
home/tax-relief-for-tenants#lab89f) of â‚¬500 a year, if you pay rent for
private rented accommodation. The credit will be available for 2022 until
2025. You will be able to claim the credit for rent paid in 2022 in early
2023, and during the year for subsequent years.

If your landlord lives outside the State, you must deduct tax for the rent and
account for it to Revenue.
