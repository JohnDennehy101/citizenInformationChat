##  Tenants' rights, responsibilities and the law

Your main rights and responsibilities as a tenant come from landlord and
tenant law, as well as from the lease or tenancy agreement you have with your
landlord.

Residential tenancies legislation outlines most tenant’s rights and
responsibilities. You can read a [ consolidated version of the Residential
Tenancies Act 2004
](http://revisedacts.lawreform.ie/eli/2004/act/27/revised/en/pdf?annotations=true)
on the Law Reform Commission's website. This includes all the updates to the
Act.

Leases or other tenancy agreements cannot take away from your rights under the
legislation. However, you and your landlord can agree on things that are not
covered by legislation in a lease or tenancy agreement, for example, who pays
for the utility bills.

If you are renting a room in your landlord's home you are not covered by
landlord and tenant legislation, though you are covered if you rent a self-
contained flat in your landlord’s home. Read more in our page on [ sharing
