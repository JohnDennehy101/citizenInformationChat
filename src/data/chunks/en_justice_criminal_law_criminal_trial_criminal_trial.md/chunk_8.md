##  Summary trial (no jury)

If you are charged with a summary offence, a judge sitting without a jury will
decide your case. It will take place in the District Court. A summary trial
will usually take the following format:

  * The Registrar of the District Court will call your case by its name. 
  * You or your legal representative will stand up to show you are in attendance in the court. 
  * The Garda (member of the Irish police force) who has made the complaint against you will take the witness stand and give evidence about what they say happened and your involvement 
  * Your legal representation is known as the defence and may cross-examine the Garda. 
  * The prosecution may call more witnesses and will question the witnesses to allow them to [ give evidence ](/en/justice/witnesses/rules-about-giving-evidence/) about the offence. 
  * Your defence may cross-examine each of the prosecution witnesses after they have given evidence. 
  * The defence may call and question witnesses to give evidence in your defence. You yourself may give evidence although you do not have to do so. 
  * The prosecution may cross-examine each of your witnesses. Read more about [ being a witness in court ](/en/justice/witnesses/being-a-witness/) . 
  * Both the prosecution and the defence may make final submissions (statements) about the case.
