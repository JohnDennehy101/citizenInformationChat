##  Introduction

There are [ two types of criminal offences ](/en/justice/criminal-
law/criminal-offences/classification-of-crimes-in-criminal-cases/) :

  * Summary offences - less serious fences that are tried by a [ judge ](/en/justice/courtroom/judge/) sitting alone 
  * Indictable offences - more serious offences that can be tried by a judge and [ jury ](/en/justice/courtroom/jury/) or by a judge
