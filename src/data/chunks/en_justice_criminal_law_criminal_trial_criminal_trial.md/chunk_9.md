####  Judgement

  * The judge will make their decision about whether you are guilty or not guilty of the offence, based on the evidence given. 
  * To find you guilty, the judge must believe that it has been proven beyond all reasonable doubt (see below) that you have committed all elements of the offence. 
  * If the judge finds that you are guilty of the offence, they may decide the sentence. 

If the judge finds that you are not guilty, they will dismiss the charges
against you.
