##  Trial by jury

Criminal jury trials are held in the Circuit Court and the Central Criminal
Court and usually follow the same format until the judgment where there is a
judge.

  * The offence or offences which you are charged with are read out. 
  * The prosecution's legal representation makes an opening speech at the trial. They tell the jury about matters that the prosecution intends to prove. They give an outline of the facts and evidence that they intend to use. They explain the nature of the charges alleged against the accused. 
  * The prosecution then calls [ witnesses ](/en/justice/witnesses/) , usually in the order listed in the [ Book of Evidence ](/en/justice/criminal-law/criminal-trial/disclosure-in-criminal-cases/) . They ask the witnesses questions to allow them to tell their story and give their evidence in their own words. The prosecution will refer to documents and statements as evidence. Forensic evidence may be introduced as exhibits and the jury is usually given an opportunity to examine these exhibits. 
  * When the prosecuting counsel has finished asking each witness questions, your defence counsel (or legal representation) may _cross-examine_ the witness. If the defence counsel intends to challenge a prosecution witness's evidence, the defence counsel must explain the basis for the challenge to the witness. 
  * When the prosecuting counsel has finished presenting the case for the prosecution, the defence begins. The defence counsel opens the defence and calls witnesses and introduces evidence. Each witness may be cross-examined by the prosecution. As you are the accused you do not have to give evidence. 
  * At the end of the case, both the prosecution and the defence counsel summarise the facts for the jury and emphasise the merits of their own case.
