####  **Providing special education teachers to pupils**

All schools have an allocation of special education teachers which they can
use to provide additional support to children who need it. Support is provided
taking into account a child’s learning needs. It is no longer based on a
diagnosis of a particular disability.

The additional teaching may be provided in the classroom or in small separate
groups. Some pupils may need additional one-to-one teaching for a specified
period.

Schools use the [ guidelines for primary schools supporting pupils with
special educational needs (pdf) ](https://s3-eu-

to help them identify pupils who require support and to plan individualised
learning programmes.

Parents or guardians do not have to source or pay for assessments for their
child to get extra teaching support in school and schools don’t have to wait
for these assessments to give children the extra teaching support they need.
