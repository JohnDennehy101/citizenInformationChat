####  **Allocating special education teachers to schools**

Each school gets a single allocation of special education teachers. The number
of special education teachers allocated to a school is determined by the size
of the school and its educational profile.

A school’s educational profile is broadly based on the number of students with
complex special educational needs, the results of standardised tests and the
social context of the school taking account of disadvantage and gender.

The arrangement recognises that all schools need an allocation for special
needs support, but provides a graduated allocation which takes into account
the actual level of need in each school.

Schools are provided with the necessary resources in advance so that children
with special educational needs can be enrolled into schools and access the
additional teaching supports they need.
