##  Irish Sign Language (ISL) scheme

The [ Irish Sign Language (ISL) scheme
](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/3283c-irish-sign-language-isl-scheme/) is
for children who are Deaf and are attending primary school, post-primary
school or special school and whose main means of communication is using Irish
Sign Language. Children must be attending a recognised school.

The National Council for Special Education Needs (NCSE) manages the scheme
which provides:

  * An ISL Specialist Classroom Support (ISL-SCS) for individual students to help access teaching and learning. 
  * An ISL Advisor who can provide training and support for schools and staff to communicate using ISL 

The [ first phase of the scheme supports children attending mainstream schools

announce-implementation-of-the-first-phase-of-isl-scheme/) .

You apply through your childâ€™s school for the ISL Scheme. The school applies
to the NCSE.

The scheme is being introduced on a phased basis and is offered in addition to
provision already in place for the student.
