##  Special needs assistants

Special needs assistants (SNAs) are allocated to schools to work with children
who have specific care needs. They provide non-teaching care support.

SNAs support pupils who have care needs resulting from a disability,
behavioural difficulties or a significant medical issue. This might include a
significant impairment of physical or sensory function or where their
behaviour makes them a danger to themselves or other pupils.

Pupil's needs can vary. A pupil may need an assistant for a few hours each
week (for example, to help feed or change or bring them to the toilet) or they
may require a full-time assistant.

SNAs may work with more than one child and can also work on a part-time basis.
Schools allocate SNA support to ensure that students with the greatest need
get the greatest level of support.
