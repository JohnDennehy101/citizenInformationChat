###  Committees

Much of the work of the DÃ¡il and Senate is done in Committees. Each House may
form Committees for particular purposes. Select Committees have the power to
take oral and written evidence and seek documents. Joint Committees are Select
Committees of each House sitting and voting together. Special Committees do
not have the same powers as Select Committees.

Committees deal with Estimates of Expenditure, Committee Stages of Bills
relevant to their terms of reference and related reports. It is common for
Committees to invite voluntary and community organisations and/ or experts to
make submissions to them on various issues and it is also common for such
organisations to ask to make a submission.
