The [ Constitution ](/en/government-in-ireland/irish-
constitution-1/constitution-introduction/) is the fundamental legal document
that sets down how Ireland should be governed. It establishes the [ President
](/en/government-in-ireland/houses-of-the-oireachtas/president-introduction-
to-the-president-of-ireland/) as the head of State, branches of government,
the courts and it also sets out how those institutions should be run.

The Constitution also describes the [ fundamental rights ](/en/government-in-

Irish citizen is entitled to.
