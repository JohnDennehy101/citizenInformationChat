##  The Oireachtas (the Irish Parliament)

The [ D치il ](/en/government-in-ireland/houses-of-the-oireachtas/dail-eireann/)
and [ Seanad ](/en/government-in-ireland/houses-of-the-oireachtas/the-seanad/)
(Senate) are collectively known as the Houses of the Oireachtas. The [
Government ](/en/government-in-ireland/how-government-works/national-
government/government-of-ireland/) is chosen by and is collectively
responsible to the D치il. There must be a minimum of 7 and a maximum of 15
Ministers. The Taoiseach, the Tanaiste and the Minister for Finance must be
members of the D치il. It is possible to have 2 Ministers who are members of the
Senate but this rarely happens.

The Government's main functions are to propose legislation, manage the public
finances and [ administer the government departments ](/en/government-in-
ireland/how-government-works/national-government/departments-of-state/) .

The Government is responsible to the D치il. It is not responsible to the
Senate. However, Ministers have a right to attend the Senate and it is normal
practice for the relevant Minister or Minister of State to be present when the
House is dealing with their areas of responsibility.
