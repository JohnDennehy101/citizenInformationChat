###  How much rent do I pay the local authority?

The weekly rent contribution that you pay will be based on the current
‘differential rent scheme’ for your local authority. This scheme links the
rent contribution a household must pay to the household income and the ability
to pay. If your income increases so does your rent contribution, and if your
income decreases, the weekly rent contribution decreases.

You must notify the local authority of any changes in your income or household
size, so that your rent contribution can be recalculated. If you take up a job
or increase your working hours, you will still be eligible for HAP, as there
is no income limit for HAP once you have qualified for the scheme. Check with
[ your local authority ](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/942f74-local-
authorities/) for the details of their differential rent scheme.
