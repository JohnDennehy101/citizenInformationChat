##  Getting the death certificate

You can get copies of the death certificate from the registration office when
you are registering the death. To get a copy of a death certificate at a later
stage, you can go directly to any civil registration office. You do not have
to order a death certificate from a service in the area the death took place.

You can also apply for a death certificate:

  * [ In person ](https://www2.hse.ie/services/births-deaths-and-marriages/contact-a-civil-registration-service.html) at a registry office

  * [ By phone ](https://www2.hse.ie/services/births-deaths-and-marriages/contact-a-civil-registration-service.html)
