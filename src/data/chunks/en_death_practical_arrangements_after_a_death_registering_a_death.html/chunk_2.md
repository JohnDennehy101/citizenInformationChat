##  Introduction

It is a legal requirement that every death that takes place in Ireland must be
recorded and registered. Records of deaths in Ireland are held in the [
General Register Office ](https://www.gov.ie/en/campaigns/af7893-general-
register-office/) , which holds records relating to Births, Marriages and
Deaths in Ireland. You can apply for a copy of a death certificate to any
Registrar of Births, Marriages and Deaths or to the General Register Office.
