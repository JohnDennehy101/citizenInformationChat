##  Employment and training supports

If you have been unemployed for a long time, there are many employment and
training schemes to help you return to work.

The schemes are aimed at people on certain social welfare payments for a
specific period.

Each scheme has its own eligibility criteria, so it is important to check the
detailed information about each one.

Some schemes fund community and voluntary organisations to provide employment
opportunities to benefit the local community.
