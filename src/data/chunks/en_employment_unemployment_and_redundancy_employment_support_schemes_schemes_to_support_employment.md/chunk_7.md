###  **Short-Term Enterprise Allowance**

The [ Short-Term Enterprise Allowance (STEA)
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/social-welfare-
payments/social-welfare-payments-and-work/short-term-enterprise-allowance/)
supports people who have lost their jobs and want to start their own
businesses.

To qualify, you must be getting a Jobseeker’s Benefit. There is no qualifying
period to get STEA. However, if you are working part-time while getting
Jobseeker’s Benefit, you won’t be eligible for this support.

The Short-Term Enterprise Allowance replaces your Jobseeker’s Benefit. It ends
when your entitlement to Jobseeker's Benefit ends (at either 9 or 6 months).
