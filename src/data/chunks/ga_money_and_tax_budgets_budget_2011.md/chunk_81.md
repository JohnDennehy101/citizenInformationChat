###  New Four-Year National Solidarity Bond

It is proposed to introduce a new, four-year, National Solidarity Bond to
complement the ten-year National Solidarity Bond which was launched last year.

to maturity. The bond will be sold by An Post on behalf of the National
Treasury Management Agency (NTMA). Further details will be announced by the
NTMA in the New Year.
