###  Student Support Scheme

The rates of the following grants are reduced by 4% in line with the
reductions in all Department of Social Protection (DSP) working-age payments

  * Higher Education Grants Scheme 
  * Vocational Education Committees' Scholarship Scheme 
  * Third Level Maintenance Grants Scheme for Trainees 
  * Maintenance Grants Scheme for Students Attending Post-Leaving Certificate Courses 

It is expected that these reduced rates will apply to the remaining portions
of grants for the current academic year that are due to be paid in 2011.

The benefits payable to mature students will be limited to those payable to
ordinary students. Mature students will no longer be automatically eligible
for the non-adjacent rate of grant.

The proportion of students qualifying for the non-adjacent rate of grant will
be reduced by changing the qualifying distance between the studentâ€™s home and
college from 24km to 45km. It is expected that these changes will take effect
from the 2011/2012 academic year.
