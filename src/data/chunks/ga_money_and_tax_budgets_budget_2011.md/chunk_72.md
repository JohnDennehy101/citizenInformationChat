###  Labour market activation programmes

The National Employment Action Plan will be refocused to establish clearer
pathways to employment by ensuring that State agencies interact early and
often with those who have lost their jobs to provide opportunities for
education, training or work experience placements as appropriate.

An additional 15,000 activation places and supports for the unemployed will be
provided under the following programmes:

  * A new Skills Development and Internship Programme will provide up to 5,000 places in the private sector. 
  * The Work Placement Programme will provide up to 5,000 places in the public service. The scheme was recently extended in the Education sector and will be extended further within other sectors over the coming months. 
  * A new Community Work Placement Scheme will provide up to 5,000 additional places in the community and voluntary sector. Participants will work 19.5 hours a week for 12 months and their rate of payment will be the maximum rate of their social welfare payment plus a weekly â‚¬20 top up.
