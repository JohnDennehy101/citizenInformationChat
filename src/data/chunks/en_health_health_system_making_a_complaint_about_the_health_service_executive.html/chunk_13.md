###  **Taking your complaint further**

You can [ complain to the Ombudsman
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/government-in-ireland/how-government-
works/standards-and-accountability/office-of-the-ombudsman/) or the Ombudsman
for Children if you are not happy with the HSE investigation.

The Ombudsman is fair, independent and free to use.

Any actions taken by service providers under agreements with the HSE are
considered to have been taken by the HSE for the purposes of the Ombudsman
investigation.
