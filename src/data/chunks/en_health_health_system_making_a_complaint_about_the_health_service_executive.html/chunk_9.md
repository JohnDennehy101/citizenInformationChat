##  How to complain to the HSE

You should first try to resolve the problem locally by bringing it to the
attention of the person in charge of the service. For example, the ward sister
in the case of a hospital complaint, or the supervisor in charge for other
services.

If you are not happy with the outcome, you can make your complaint through the
formal HSE complaints system. You can do this by post, phone, email, online,
or through advocacy or accessibility services.

Itâ€™s best to make your formal complaint in writing, giving as much detail as
you can. You should include:

  * Who was involved 
  * Where it happened 
  * What happened and when 
  * What you are concerned about 
  * Any action you have taken to try to resolve the issue 
  * What you want to happen now 

The HSE must:

  * Acknowledge written complaints within 5 working days 
  * Investigate the complaint within 30 days 

Keep you updated about progress on your complaint every 20 working days, if
the investigation takes longer than 30 days.
