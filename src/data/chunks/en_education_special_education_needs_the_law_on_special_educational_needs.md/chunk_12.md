###  **Discrimination on grounds of disability**

The Equal Status Acts set out certain activities that do not constitute
discrimination. The following relate to discrimination on the grounds of
disability:

  * Schools can make different arrangements for sport for children based on their age, gender, or disability if these are reasonably necessary. 
  * Schools will not be considered to discriminate against a student with a disability if complying with the legislation would have a seriously detrimental effect on, or make it impossible to provide, services to other students. 
  * In certain circumstances, discrimination on the grounds of disability can happen if the school fails to do all that is reasonable to accommodate the needs of a person with a disability. If a person with a disability cannot use a service without special treatment or facilities being provided, then the service provider may need to provide such special arrangements if there is only a _nominal_ (small) cost involved.* 

* The Act clarifies that the nominal cost issue does not prejudice or dilute the various provisions in the Education Act 1998 in relation to children with a disability. As these provisions all relate to the use of public funds, private primary schools are only obliged to make special provision for children with disabilities if there is only a nominal cost involved.
