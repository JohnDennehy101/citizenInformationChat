###  **Funding**

Under the 1998 Act, the Minister for Education has responsibilities in
relation to funding, including funding support services for students with
disabilities.

Schools must:

  * Use available resources to meet the educational needs of all students, including those with disabilities 
  * Use State resources to make reasonable provisions and accommodation for students with disabilities and special educational needs (including any necessary changes to buildings, or for purchase of equipment) 

The Act also provides that the criteria for funding of schools may allow for
the payment of additional grants to schools, considering the level of
educational disadvantage.
