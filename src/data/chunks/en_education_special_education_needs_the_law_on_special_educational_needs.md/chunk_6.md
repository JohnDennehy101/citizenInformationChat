###  **Services for people with special educational needs**

The Act sets out services to be provided to people with special educational
needs. However, the relevant sections of the Act have not yet been commenced,
so the services (including personal education plans) are not yet in place.

Under the Disability Act 2005, [ assessments of need
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/health/health-services/health-
services-for-people-with-disabilities/assessment-of-need-for-people-with-
disabilites/) can be carried out by the HSE. If a child must have their
educational needs assessed, the HSE will contact the NCSE, who will nominate a
person to complete a [ Report of Education Needs ](https://ncse.ie/completing-
the-report-of-education-needs) .

The NCSE is responsible for providing services to school-going children.

The Department of Education provides supports to children with a disability.
