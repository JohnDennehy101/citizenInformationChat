##  Rights of UK citizens in Ireland after 31 December 2020

UK citizens can live and work in Ireland without restriction.

If you are a UK citizen living in Ireland, you have many of the same rights
and entitlements as an Irish citizen. UK citizens can:

  * Enter Ireland without a visa 
  * Travel between the UK and Ireland 
  * Work without an employment permit 
  * Access the public healthcare system 
  * Vote in general elections 

These rights are based on a series of bilateral agreements between Ireland and
the UK that started in 1922. You can read more about the [ Common Travel Area
between Ireland and the United Kingdom ](/en/government-in-ireland/ireland-
and-the-uk/common-travel-area-between-ireland-and-the-uk/) .

In May 2019, the Irish and British governments [ re-affirmed their commitment
to maintaining the Common Travel Area
](https://www.dfa.ie/media/dfa/eu/brexit/brexitandyou/Joint-Statement-CTA.pdf)
.

The Common Travel Area is separate from EU law, and continues to apply since
the UK left the EU on 31 January 2020.
