###  **If you disagree**

If you disagree with your employer’s proposed change to your contract, and
want to continue working on your current terms, your employer may decide to
make you [ redundant
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/employment/unemployment-and-
redundancy/redundancy/what-is-redundancy/) .

Your employer must prove there is a genuine need for redundancy and that they
have followed fair procedures. Otherwise, you may be able to claim for [
unfair dismissal
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/employment/unemployment-and-
redundancy/dismissal/unfair-dismissal/) .

If your employer insists on [ cutting your hours or pay
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/employment/employment-rights-and-
conditions/contracts-of-employment/being-asked-to-take-a-cut-in-pay-or-hours/)
, you may decide you have no choice but to leave your job. This is called [
constructive dismissal
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/employment/unemployment-and-
redundancy/dismissal/constructive-dismissal/) , where the decision to leave is
yours but the employer’s actions have forced you to resign.

Proving constructive dismissal can be difficult, so you should get
professional legal advice. Community Law and Mediation (CLM) offers [ free
legal information, advice and mediation services
