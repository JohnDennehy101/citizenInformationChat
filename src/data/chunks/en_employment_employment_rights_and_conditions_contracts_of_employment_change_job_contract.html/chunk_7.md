###  **Your contract was changed without telling you**

If your employer changes your terms of employment without telling you, speak
with your employer directly. You can also raise the issue with the HR section,
if you have one.

If you are a member of a [ trade union
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/employment/employment-rights-and-
conditions/industrial-relations-and-trade-unions/trade-unions/) , your local
representative can provide guidance and support.

If you still don’t get written notification of the changes, and you cannot
resolve the issue with your employer, you can complain to the Workplace
Relations Commission (WRC) – see 'How to make a complaint' below.
