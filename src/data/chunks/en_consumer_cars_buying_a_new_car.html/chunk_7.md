###  Shop around for the best deal

You should always shop around, compare prices and make sure you know what you
are agreeing to before signing a car finance contract. If a garage or car
dealer is offering to arrange finance, they are acting as an agent (or a
_credit intermediary_ ) for a finance company and will earn commission for
arranging the loan. Agents must be authorised by the CCPC. The CCPC keeps a [
register of credit intermediaries ](https://www.ccpc.ie/business/credit-
intermediaries/authorised-credit-intermediaries/) .

The CCPC has more information about [ paying for your car
](https://www.ccpc.ie/consumers/cars/paying-for-your-car/) and what you can do
if you have problems making the payments for [ HP or PCP agreements
](https://www.ccpc.ie/consumers/money/debt/problems-making-car-repayments/) .
