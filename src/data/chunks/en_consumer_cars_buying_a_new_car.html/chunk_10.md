##  Trade-ins

If you are replacing your old car, trading it in can help to bring down the
cost of a new one. You should shop around and see what different garages or
car dealerships will offer for your old car as a trade-in.

Find out what your car is worth before taking it to a dealer. You can get
independent expert advice on this from a qualified mechanic or by doing your
own research online on [ motorcheck.ie ](https://www.motorcheck.ie/faqs/what-
is-the-value-of-the-car/) . Note that a garage or car dealer is likely to pay
less for it than if you sell it yourself. The CCPC has more tips about [
