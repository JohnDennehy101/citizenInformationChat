###  Vehicle Registration Tax (VRT)

If you buy the car from a dealer, they will register it and pay the VRT to
Revenue. This means the total you pay for the vehicle should include the cost
of VRT. [ Value Added Tax (VAT) ](/en/money-and-tax/tax/duties-and-vat/value-
added-tax/) is also charged on the sale of most products.

After the dealer registers the car and pays the VRT, they will get:

  * A receipt for the VRT paid, showing the carâ€™s registration number 
  * An RF100 form 

When buying a car, make sure the dealer gives you the correct VRT receipt and
RF100 form. You will need this when applying to your local motor tax office.
