##  Will I have to explain why I am notgiving evidence?

If the prosecution applies to have your statement admitted in evidence, the
court will ask why you are refusing to give evidence or why you are giving
evidence which is different to your statement. If you deny having made the
statement, the court will need evidence from you about this denial. Your
answers may influence the courtâ€™s decision about whether to admit your
statement as evidence.
