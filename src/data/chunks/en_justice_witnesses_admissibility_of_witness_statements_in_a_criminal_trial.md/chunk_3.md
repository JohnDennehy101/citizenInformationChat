##  When can my statement be admitted asevidence?

Normally, a witness confirms what they said in their witness statement by
giving evidence in court. If you do not you may be declared a [ ‘hostile
witness.’ ](/en/justice/witnesses/hostile-witness/) If you refuse to give
evidence, deny making the statement or give evidence in court which is
inconsistent with the statement, your witness statement may still be admitted
as evidence if:

  * You confirm or it is proven that you made the statement 

and

  * The court is satisfied that the statement was made voluntarily and it is reliable. Your statement must have been made on oath or affirmation, or contain a statutory declaration by you to the effect that your statement is true, or the court must be otherwise satisfied that you knew you needed to tell the truth when you were making it.
