##  Introduction

Working from home is also known as remote working or e-working.

If you work from home for substantial periods, either full-time or part-time,
you may be able to claim tax relief on the extra costs, including:

  * Electricity 
  * Heating 
  * Broadband 

The cost of items you buy, such as office equipment, is not eligible for
Remote Working Relief.

You can [ apply for the tax relief ](eworking_and_tax_relief.en.html#ld1a9a)
after the end of the tax year or during the year. If you claim during the
year, you can get real-time credits and have your tax reduced during the year.

If you use only part of your home for e-working, it does not affect [
exemption from Capital Gains Tax
](../capital_taxes/capital_gains_tax.en.html#l728f0) if you sell it as your
principal private residence.
