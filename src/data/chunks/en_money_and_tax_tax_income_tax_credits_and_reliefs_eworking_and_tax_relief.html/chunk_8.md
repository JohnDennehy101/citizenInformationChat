###  Example 1

Mary worked from home for 9 months in 2021 while her office was closed due to
COVID-19. To make a claim, Mary needs to work out how many **working days**
she worked from home. She should exclude weekends, public holidays and any
annual leave taken during the 9 months she worked from home. Her total working
days are 168.

During 2021, her household bills for heating and electricity come to €1500 and
her broadband comes to €450.

To find out how much tax she can claim back, she:

  * Multiplies the amount due on the electricity and heating bills by the number of days she worked at home (€1500 x 168 = 252,000) 
  * Then, she divides her answer by 365 (252,000 / 365 = €690) 
  * Lastly, she calculates 10% of this amount to find out what she can claim for heating and electricity (10% of €689 is **€69** ) 

Mary uses the same method to see how much tax she can claim back on broadband.

  * €450 (broadband bill) x 168 (days worked) = 75,600 
  * 75,600 divided by 365 = €207 
  * Revenue will let Mary claim 30% of the cost of broadband in 2021. 30% of €207 is **€62** . 

This means, at the end of 2021, Mary can claim tax back on expenses of:

  * €69 for heating and electricity 
  * €62 for broadband 
  * **€131** in total 

The amount she gets back depends on her rate of tax. If she pays tax at the
higher tax rate of 40% she will get €52.40 back from her taxes (40% of €131).
If she pays tax at the lower rate of 20%, she will get €26.20 back (20% of
€131).
