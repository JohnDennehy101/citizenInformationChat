##  What expenses can I claim?

Tax relief on e-working covers the additional costs of working from home. This
includes:

  * Electricity 
  * Heating 
  * Broadband 

Items you buy, such as laptops, computers, office equipment and office
furniture, are not allowable costs for Remote Working Relief.

**Should I pay tax on equipment from my employer?**

If your employer gives you equipment that you need to do your work, like a
computer or printer, and you mainly use it for work, it is not considered a
benefit-in-kind. This means that you do not have to pay any tax for getting
the equipment from your employer.
