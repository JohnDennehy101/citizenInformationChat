##  How to calculate the amount you can get tax relief on

To calculate the amount of costs you can get tax relief on:

  * Add your electricity, heating and internet costs and multiply the total costs by the number of days worked at home 
  * Divide by 365 (or 366 for a leap year) 
  * Multiply by 30% (0.3) 

For the years **2020 and 2021** , the relief for internet was 30%, as above.
However, the relief for electricity and heating was 10%, so these costs would
be calculated as follows:

  * Add the costs for electricity and heating and multiply the total costs by the number of days worked at home 
  * Divide by 365 (or 366 in 2020) 
  * Multiply by 10% (0.1)
