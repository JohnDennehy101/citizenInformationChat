##  How much can I claim?

You may have extra costs when you are working from home including heating,
electricity and broadband costs. Your employer can pay you a contribution
towards these costs or you can make a claim for tax relief during the year or
after the end of the year.

**If your employer pays you a working from home allowance** towards these
expenses, you can get up to €3.20 per day without paying any tax, PRSI or USC
on it. If your employer pays more than €3.20 per day to cover expenses, you
pay tax, PRSI and USC as normal on the amount above €3.20. You should note
that employers are not legally obliged to make this payment to their
employees.

**If your employer does not pay you a working from home allowance** for your
expenses, you can make a claim for tax relief during the year or after the end
of the year. You will get money back from the taxes you paid. If you share
your bills with someone else, the cost is divided between you, based on the
amount paid by each person (see Example 2 below).

The amount of costs you can claim is based on:

  * How many days you worked from home 
  * The cost of your expenses 
  * The percentage of your costs that Revenue counts as working from home expenses 

You can claim relief on the following:

  * From 2022, 30% of electricity, heating and internet costs 
  * For 2020 and 2021, 30% of internet costs and 10% of electricity and heating costs 

You can only claim for the days that you work from home. This does not include
times you may have brought work home to do outside your normal working hours.

Your annual costs are taken into account but you only get relief for the
proportion of the days you spent working from home during the year. For
example, in 2023 the proportion would be the number of days working from home
divided by 365. For 2020, it was a leap year so you divide by 366.
