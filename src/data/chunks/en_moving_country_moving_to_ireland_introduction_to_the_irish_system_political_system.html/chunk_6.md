##  Legislation

It is almost always the Government of the day that propose new laws. A
Minister presents a _Bill_ to the D치il or Seanad for discussion and decision.
A _Bill_ is proposed [ legislation ](/en/government-in-ireland/houses-of-the-
oireachtas/legislation/) \- after it is passed and signed by the President, it
is called an _Act._ Sometimes, a TD or Senator presents a [ Private Member's
Bill ](/en/government-in-ireland/houses-of-the-oireachtas/private-members-
bills/) . It is very rare for such a Bill to get beyond the first stage - the
reasons for this are political rather than legal. However, some important
legislation in recent years has resulted from Private Members' Bills - notably
The Judicial Separation and Family Law Reform Act 1989. The procedure is the
same whether the Bill is proposed by the Government or by a Member.

Usually, a Bill is presented by a Minister to the D치il. Occasionally the
process is started in the Seanad but any Bills dealing with taxation or
related matters must start in the D치il. Each Bill has to go through a number
of _stages_ or _readings_ . It can be defeated at any of these stages and, if
this happens in the D치il, the process ends there. The Seanad can only obstruct
a Bill. In practice, Government Bills are not often defeated. You can view [
