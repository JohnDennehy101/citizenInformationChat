###  Secondary legislation

Subordinate legislation is a lesser form of legislation than Acts. The most
common is a Statutory Instrument (SI). There must be specific power laid down
in an Act in order to allow a Statutory Instrument to be effective. Usually an
Act authorises a Minister to make Regulations dealing with details. The Act
itself sets out the general law. The Statutory Instrument cannot deviate in
any way from what is laid down in the Act - if they do, they are what is
called _ultra vires_ . That means "beyond the powers" - that is, the Minister
does not have the power to do what he is purporting to do.

Statutory Instruments do not usually have to be passed by the Oireachtas.
