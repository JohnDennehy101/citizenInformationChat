###  Green Papers, White Papers and discussion documents

A Green Paper is a discussion document, usually written by civil servants, in
which an issue is outlined, various options are suggested and the advantages
and disadvantages of those options may be set out. Generally, the public is
asked for submissions on the options proposed. After this process is complete,
a White Paper is drawn up - this sets out the Government's policy on the issue
and what it intends to do. The proposals in the White Paper are then
implemented.

Sometimes this process occurs but the titles Green and White Papers are not
used; they are called discussion documents or something similar. Sometimes a
White Paper is published without a preceding Green Paper. Sometimes the
process is carried through and then nothing happens after the White Paper is
published. Sometimes papers are published which have the same effect as a
White Paper but are called strategy documents or similar. The actual public
consultation process varies as well.
