###  Controlling the public finances

Each year, the Government prepares the _Estimates of the Receipts and
Expenditure of the State_ . This is an outline of the costs of running each
Department and Office of State. The Estimates are published before the annual
Budget. The Dáil and the relevant Committees debate the Estimates in detail.
The Estimates are passed by the Dáil and are given statutory effect by the
_Appropriation Act_ . The Budget is given immediate legal effect by financial
resolutions of the Dáil on the evening of the Budget speech. The Finance Act
must be passed within 4 months of the Budget.

Budgeting is on an annual basis. You can [ view the full text of Ireland's
