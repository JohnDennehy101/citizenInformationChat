###  Special hazards or physical or mental strain

If your night work involves special hazards or heavy physical or mental
strain, you cannot work more than 8 hours in a 24-hour period. Your employer
must identify any special hazards or physical or mental strain in your work,
assess how harmful they could be and take steps to reduce any risks.
