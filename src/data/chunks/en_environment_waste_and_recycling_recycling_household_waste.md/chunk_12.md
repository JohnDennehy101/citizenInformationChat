##  What can I bring to a recycling facility?

You can bring many items to recycling facilities. But it is important to check
with your local centre, as what they accept can vary from centre to centre.

Most recycling centres accept:

  * Glass bottles and jars â€“ You can recycle the lids and caps separately in your recycling bin at home. 
  * Paper (newspapers, magazines, office paper, junk mail, comics and light cardboard) 
  * Drinks cartons, for example, milk or juice cartons 
  * Aluminium, for example, soft drink and beer cans or foil 
  * Plastic bottles and cartons 
  * Food tins, for example tins for fruit, vegetables or pet food 
  * Plastic bottle tops, metal and aluminium lids 
  * Textiles, for example, clean clothes, bed linen, towels, coats and jackets 
  * White goods, for example, washing machines, cookers, dryers, dishwashers, fridges 
  * Batteries. You can also recycle these for free in certain shops and supermarkets as part of the [ Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) ](/en/environment/waste-and-recycling/weee/) scheme. 

**All materials should be clean** , to avoid contamination. You should always
wash out bottles, cans and yogurt pots before recycling.
