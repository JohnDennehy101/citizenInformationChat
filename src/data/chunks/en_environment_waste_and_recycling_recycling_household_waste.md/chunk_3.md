##  Where can I recycle my waste?

There are different ways to recycle waste. You can take waste that can be
recycled to a recycling facility, use your recycling bin or use a kerbside
collection (when available).

For organic waste, you can use your brown bin or compost it yourself. Many
recycling facilities also accept bulky organic waste such as garden waste.

There are 4 types of permanent recycling facility:

  * Bring banks 
  * Civic amenity sites 
  * Recycling centres 
  * Deposit Return Scheme for bottle and can recycling
