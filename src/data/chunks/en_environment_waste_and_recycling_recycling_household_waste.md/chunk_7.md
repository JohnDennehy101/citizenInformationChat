###  Deposit Return Scheme for bottle and can recycling

The [ Deposit Return Scheme ](/en/environment/waste-and-recycling/deposit-
return-scheme/) started on 1 February 2024 and changed how certain drinks
containers are recycled.

The cost of the deposit is automatically added to the cost of the drink. You
can get the deposit back by returning your containers once they are empty and
undamaged.

See our page on the [ Deposit Return Scheme ](/en/environment/waste-and-
recycling/deposit-return-scheme/) for more information.
