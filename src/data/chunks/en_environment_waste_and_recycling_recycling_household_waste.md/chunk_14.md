###  Recycling hazardous waste

Many household products contain substances that are potentially harmful to the
environment. They include:

  * Medicines 
  * Aerosols 
  * Bulbs and fluorescent tubes 
  * Polishes 
  * Adhesives 
  * Household cleaners 
  * Drain cleaners 
  * Solvents 
  * Weedkillers 
  * Fertilisers 

Some of these items can be brought to a civic amenity centre, where they can
be recycled or disposed of.

Your local pharmacy can dispose of certain items safely and properly for you,
including:

  * Pharmaceutical drugs (such as painkillers) 
  * Medical waste (such as surgical gloves) 
  * Containers for pharmaceutical drugs 

If you are disposing syringes, you should get a sharps waste container from
your local GP or hospital. The HSE have [ advise on how and where to get these

Some local authorities organise mobile collections, where hazardous waste can
be left at a central point. Contact your [ local authority

information.
