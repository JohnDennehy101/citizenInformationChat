###  Part-time employees

The [ Protection of Employees (Part-Time Work) Act 2001
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2001/en/act/pub/0045/index.html) prevents
discrimination against [ part-time workers
](../../types_of_employment/part_time_workers.en.html) . It aims to improve
the quality of part-time work, to facilitate the development of part-time work
on a voluntary basis and to contribute to the flexible organisation of working
time that takes account of the needs of employers and workers. It guarantees
that part-time workers are not treated less favourably than full-time workers.
