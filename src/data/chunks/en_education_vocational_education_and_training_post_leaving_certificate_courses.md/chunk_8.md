##  How to apply for a PLC course

Use the national learners' database [ qualifax.ie
](http://www.qualifax.ie/index.php?option=com_wrapper&view=wrapper&Itemid=15)
to find the course in which you are most interested. Apply directly to the
school or college offering that course. Many PLC courses take place in your
local Education and Training Board (ETB).

You may be called for an interview before a final selection is made because
the courses are work-related. These interviews are often quite informal and
offer you the opportunity to discuss your particular interest in the course.
