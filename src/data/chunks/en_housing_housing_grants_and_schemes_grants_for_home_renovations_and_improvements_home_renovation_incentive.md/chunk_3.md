##  HRI claims and what happens to excess relief?

**The HRI scheme is closed and 2018 was the last tax year you could claim the
relief for.**

You claimed the relief on the HRI online system. In general, the tax credit
was paid over the 2 years following the year the work was carried out and paid
for. So, people who got the work done in 2018 were paid half the relief in
2019, and the other half in 2020.

However, if you didnâ€™t pay enough income tax to benefit from the relief in the
years you were due it, the relief is carried forward every year until you can
fully use it.
