###  Affordability

€89 million is provided in 2019 for a **Serviced Sites Fund** . This fund will
deliver at least 6,000 subsidised affordable homes on local authority sites
over its lifetime. The scheme will apply to new homes for single people
earning up to €50,000 and couples earning up to €75,000.

€41 million has been allocated to the **Local Infrastructure Housing
Activation Fund (LIHAF)** in 2019. This fund accelerates the provision of
public infrastructure (such as roads and bridges) to allow for the development
of land for housing, some of which will be used for social and affordable
homes.
