###  Widowed Person or Surviving Civil Partner’s Tax Credit

If you are a widowed person or a surviving civil partner, you can claim an
increased personal tax credit. The amount of the tax credit depends on whether
or not you have dependent children and when your spouse or civil partner died.

**If you do not have dependent children**

You get the Married Person or Civil Partner's Tax Credit in the year of death.
This is €3,750 in 2024 (€3,550 in 2023).

In the years following the year of death, you will get the Widowed Person or
Surviving Civil Partner's (without dependent children) Tax Credit. This is
€2,415 in 2024 (€2,315 in 2023).

**If you have dependent children**

You get the Married Person or Civil Partner's Tax Credit in the year of death.
This is €3,750 in 2024 (€3,550 in 2023).

In the years following the year of death you will get:

  * A Widowed Person or Surviving Civil Partner's (with dependent children) Tax Credit, which is €1,875 
  * A [ Single Person Child Carer Credit ](/en/money-and-tax/tax/income-tax-credits-and-reliefs/single-person-child-carer-tax-credit/) if eligible, which is €1,750 

For the first 5 years after the year of death you will also get the Widowed
Parent Tax Credit – see below.

You are not considered a widowed person with dependent children for tax
purposes if:

  * You are cohabiting with a partner or 
  * You no longer have dependent children 

In these cases you will get the Widowed Person or Surviving Civil Partner's
Tax Credit instead.
