##  Introduction

If your accommodation or your daily living costs are provided by the Health
Service Executive (HSE), or by another provider on behalf of the HSE, you may
pay a Long-Stay Contribution towards these costs. (Long-Stay Contributions
replaced long-stay charges from 1 January 2017.)

Long-Stay Contributions also apply to mental health and disability residential
support services provided by, or on behalf of, the HSE in accommodation
without a nursing or medical service. A lower rate of Contribution applies in
such accommodation.
