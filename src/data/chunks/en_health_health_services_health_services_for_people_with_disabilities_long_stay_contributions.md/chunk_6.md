###  Excluded income

Income that is not taken into account in assessing your Contribution is called
excluded or disregarded income.

Income that is not your own is excluded (for example, the income of your
partner, spouse or other family member).

The first €120 a week of earnings from a rehabilitative job is also
disregarded.

For savings up to €15,000, any interest or dividends you earn are not taken
into account.

The following payments are disregarded:

  * Family Income Supplement 
  * Child Benefit 
  * Carer's Allowance 
  * Domiciliary Care Allowance 
  * Rent supplement or accommodation subsidy 
  * Weekly supplements paid under the Supplementary Welfare Allowance scheme 
  * Increase for a Qualified Adult or Qualified Child 
  * Fuel, Island, and Living Alone Allowances 
  * Guardian's Payments 
  * Foster care allowance 
  * Mobility Allowance 
  * Third-level education maintenance grants 
  * Rehabilitation training allowance 

The following compensation payments are disregarded (along with any income
that comes from the payment):

  * Any payment under the Redress for Women Resident in Certain Institutions Act 2015 (for women who worked in, for example, Magdalen Laundries) 
  * Any ex-gratia payment under the Lourdes Hospital Redress Scheme 2007 or the Lourdes Hospital Payment Scheme 
  * Any ex-gratia payment under the Symphysiotomy Payment Scheme 
  * Certain payments for disability caused by Thalidomide 

When your assessment is finished, you will get a letter that tells you the
amount of your Long-Stay Contribution.

If your circumstances change, you should tell your service provider, who will
arrange an assessment to see if your Contribution should change.
