##  Appeals

If your circumstances change, you can ask your service provider to update your
assessment.

If you think a mistake has been made in your assessment, you can ask your
service provider to correct it.

If you are unhappy with the amount of your Long-Stay Contribution, you can
appeal the decision.

If you wish to make an appeal you can write to the HSE National Appeals
Office, An Clochar, Ballyshannon Health Campus, College Street Ballyshannon,
Co Donegal F94 TPX4, or by email to: [ nationalappeals@hse.ie
](mailto:nationalappeals@hse.ie)

Explain why you are dissatisfied with the decision and the reasons you want it
to be reconsidered. Include a copy of the decision letter and any other
relevant documents.

If you are still unhappy after you have made an appeal you can write a letter
of complaint to the [ Office of the Ombudsman ](/en/government-in-ireland/how-
government-works/standards-and-accountability/office-of-the-ombudsman/) .
