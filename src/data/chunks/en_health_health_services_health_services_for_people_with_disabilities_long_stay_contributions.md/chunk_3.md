##  Rules

You are being provided with _Residential Support Services_ if your
accommodation or your daily living costs are provided by the HSE, or on behalf
of the HSE (but the Contributions described here don't apply if you are
covered by the Nursing Home Support Scheme or are receiving acute in-patient
care).

You will generally have to pay a set amount towards these maintenance and
accommodation costs. This is called a _Long-Stay Contribution_ (also known as
the _Residential Support Services Maintenance and Accommodation Contribution_
).

The Long-Stay Contribution applies if you have been getting Residential
Support Services for more than 30 days in the last 12 months. You only pay for
days when you get Residential Support Services from your provider (a day is
counted if you receive the services overnight, that is, at midnight).

The Contribution goes towards your accommodation and maintenance costs such as
heating, electricity, groceries or meals.

If you already pay rent or pay towards groceries, for example, into a
household fund, this can continue and be taken into account as part of your
Long-Stay Contribution.

If some or all of your daily living costs – food, utility bills and so on –
are provided for by the HSE, or on behalf of the HSE, but your accommodation
is not, your Contribution will be reduced by the amount of rent you pay or by
€30 a week, whichever is more.

If you have a medical card, you pay the Long-Stay Contribution towards your
food, utilities and accommodation as these are not covered by your medical
card.
