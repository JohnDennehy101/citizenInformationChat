##  Rates

The amount you contribute depends on:

  * Your income. 
  * Your essential expenses. You may qualify for a waiver to ensure that what you pay will be within your means (see below). 
  * What type of accommodation you live in. 

There are 3 types of accommodation:

  * Category A accommodation where there is full-time (24-hour) medical or nursing care 
  * Category B accommodation where there is part-time (less than 24-hour) medical or nursing care 
  * Category C accommodation (other accommodation, such as independent living settings) 

There is a maximum rate of Contribution. If your income is over a certain
amount you pay the maximum rate. If your income is lower you pay less. The
Contribution rates for each income band are set out in the tables in [
Statutory Instrument No. 106 of 2019

income details or go through the assessment process.
