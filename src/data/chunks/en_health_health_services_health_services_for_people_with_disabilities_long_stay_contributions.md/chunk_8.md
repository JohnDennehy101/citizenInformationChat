##  Waiver

You can apply for a waiver if you have essential expenses and would find it
difficult to afford the standard Contribution rate for your income. If you
have a waiver it is an agreement that you will pay a reduced Long-Stay
Contribution or no Long-Stay Contribution. Your financial circumstances and
the needs set out in your care plan will be considered.

The waiver assessment takes into account:

  * Payments you already make for your maintenance and accommodation. 
  * Expenses to meet your medical, therapeutic, rehabilitative or health-related needs (including needs set out in your care plan). 
  * Your essential expenses. This includes the reasonable expenses of your dependants. It also includes your financial commitments such as rent or mortgage payments for the family home, maintenance payments or repayments on existing loans. 

Your service provider will tell you what documents you need to provide with
your request for a waiver, such as bills, receipts, bank statements and pay
slips. However, if you do not have all these documents with you during your
individual assessment, you can provide any outstanding documents as soon as
possible afterwards so that your service provider can finish the assessment.

When your assessment is finished, you will get a letter that tells you the
amount of the Long-Stay Contribution you have to pay, whether you have a
waiver or not, the amount of the waiver (if any), and an explanation.
