###  Your duty to cooperate

You must cooperate with the assessment of your application for international
protection. If you do not cooperate, your application will be assessed based
on the information you provided before the IPO decided you were no longer co-
operating. At the appeal stage, failure to co-operate could lead to your [
application being withdrawn ](/en/moving-country/asylum-seekers-and-
refugees/the-asylum-process-in-ireland/withdrawing-from-the-asylum-process-in-
ireland/) .

You must submit any information that you are asked to submit as soon as you
can, and you must be honest in your application. You must attend interviews
with the IPO. If you have a reason why you cannot attend, you should tell the
IPO or IPAT as soon as possible.

You must comply with Irish laws, and you must follow any instructions that you
are given by the IPO or the Minister for Justice. This may include a
requirement to stay in a particular area or to report to an immigration
officer or Garda station.
