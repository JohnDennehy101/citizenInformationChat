##  What happens at an appointment with a dietician?

Your dietician will try to find out if your diet and lifestyle are causing or
contributing to the health issue you are experiencing. Your dietician may:

  * Take measurements like your height, weight and, sometimes, your waist 
  * Ask you about your usual diet, lifestyle, medical history, experiences and feelings about food and weight issues 
  * Help you to plan changes and set goals to improve your diet and overall health. 

A dietician can help with many different health issues, for example, anaemia,
diabetes, inflammatory bowel disease, coeliac disease, irritable bowel
syndrome, an eating disorder, swallowing problems, weight issues (overweight
or underweight) and constipation.
