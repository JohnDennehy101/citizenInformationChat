###  **Higher Level Education option**

You can attend any Higher Level Education course in an approved third-level
institution (university, institute of education, or third-level college).

The course must be a full-time day course and be approved for the Student
Grant Scheme, or be approved by Quality and Qualifications Ireland (QQI). Not
all QQI courses are approved for BTEA.
