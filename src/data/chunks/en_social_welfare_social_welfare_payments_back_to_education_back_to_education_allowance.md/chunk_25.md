####  **If you were getting a jobseeker’s payment**

If you were getting a jobseeker’s payment before going back to education, you
are not paid BTEA during the summer months between academic years.

Your Intreo Centre will contact you in March or April to ask the date of last
attendance for the current academic year, and you will not be paid BTEA beyond
this date. However, you may get BTEA during the summer if you are on work
placement or work experience that is an essential part of your course.

You will get BTEA again from the start of the new academic year, if you are
still eligible.

If you can’t find work during the summer, you may be entitled to [ Jobseeker's
Benefit ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/unemployed-
people/jobseekers-benefit/) or [ Jobseeker's Allowance
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/unemployed-
people/jobseekers-allowance/) (you must [ meet all of the conditions
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/unemployed-
people/rules-for-getting-a-jobseekers-payment/) ). If you claim Jobseeker’s
Allowance and work part-time, your earnings are assessed against your
Jobseeker’s Allowance.
