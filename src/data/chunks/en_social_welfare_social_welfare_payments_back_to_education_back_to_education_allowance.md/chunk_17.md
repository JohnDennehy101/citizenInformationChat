###  **Unemployment or illness credits**

You may qualify for BTEA on a non-payment basis if you are:

  * Signing on for unemployment credits, or 
  * Submitting medical certificates for illness credits for the required period of time (either 3, 9, or 12 months, or 2 years, depending on your course) 

This means you do not get a weekly Back to Education Allowance. You continue
to be awarded [ credited contributions
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-
system/social-insurance-prsi/credited-social-insurance-contributions/) while
you are taking part in the BTEA scheme.

If you take part in the BTEA scheme on a non-payment basis, you can also apply
for a [ student grant ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/education/third-
level-education/fees-and-supports-for-third-level-education/student-grant-
scheme/) , to be assessed for both the fee and maintenance component of the
grant.
