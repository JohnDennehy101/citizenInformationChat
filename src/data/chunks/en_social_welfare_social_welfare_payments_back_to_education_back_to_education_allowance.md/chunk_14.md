####  **Meeting the qualifying period**

You don’t have to have been getting your qualifying payment continuously. Time
spent on other qualifying social welfare payments (see ‘Qualifying social
welfare payments for BTEA’ above) which is not broken by more than 12 months
can be linked to help you meet the qualifying period required.

Time spent on some education, training, work placement and activation support
schemes, which is not broken by more than 12 months, can be taken into account
to meet the qualifying period.
