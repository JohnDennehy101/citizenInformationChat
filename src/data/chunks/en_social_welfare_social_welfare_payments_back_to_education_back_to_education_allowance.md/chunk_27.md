##  How much is the BTEA?

Your weekly BTEA rate is equal to your previous social welfare payment (see
‘Qualifying social welfare payments for BTEA’ above). You may also qualify for
increases for a [ qualified adult
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-
system/claiming-a-social-welfare-payment/claiming-an-increase-in-your-social-
welfare-payment-for-an-adult-dependant/) and [ qualified children
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-
system/claiming-a-social-welfare-payment/claiming-and-increase-in-your-
payment-for-a-child-dependant/) .

You must have established an entitlement to a qualifying payment immediately
before starting BTEA, even if you were previously on an employment or training
scheme.

If you are aged under 25 and getting a [ reduced Jobseeker's Allowance payment
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/unemployed-
people/jobseekers-allowance/#28a767) because of your age, your payment will
increase to €232. Any means that you have will be deducted from this rate.

You can get your BTEA paid directly to your bank account. It is paid for the
duration of the course.
