###  If you are not getting a disability payment

If you are not getting a disability payment, you can still apply for the WSS.

To apply, you need a recent specialist’s report or doctor’s letter confirming
your disability.

Your doctor must also fill out a confidential medical report form confirming
that you have a disability which could cause a shortfall in productivity.
