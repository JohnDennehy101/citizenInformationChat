##  Payment rates

The Department of Social Protection (DSP), the employer and the employee must
agree on the productivity shortfall, if any.

The employer pays the employee the going rate for the job. The employer is
then paid a subsidy of €6.30 an hour for the hours worked. The maximum annual
subsidy to the employer is €12,776, based on a 39-hour week.

The employer may get additional funding, depending on which strand of the WSS
they fall into – read ‘the different strands of WSS’ below.

Employers are paid the grant by electronic fund transfer.

Employers may get the WSS for employees who are entitled to keep their
Disability Allowance (DA) or Blind Pension (BP). Although, generally, the
employee must give up their primary social welfare payment when they start
work under the Wage Subsidy Scheme (WSS). For example, if you are on
Jobseeker’s Allowance, you must stop claiming this payment.
