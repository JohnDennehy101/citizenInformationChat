###  Keeping your medical card and other benefits

You may be able to keep your [ medical card ](/en/health/medical-cards-and-gp-
visit-cards/medical-card/) and certain extra benefits for a number of years
after you start work on the WSS scheme.

If you were unemployed for 12 months or more before starting work on the WSS,
you can keep your medical card for 3 years from the date you started work.

You may also be able to keep any extra benefits you were getting before you
started the WSS employment scheme, such as:

  * [ Free Travel ](/en/social-welfare/extra-social-welfare-benefits/free-travel/)
  * [ Household Benefits package ](/en/social-welfare/extra-social-welfare-benefits/household-benefits-package/)
  * [ Living Alone Increase ](/en/social-welfare/extra-social-welfare-benefits/living-alone-allowance/)
  * [ Fuel Allowance ](/en/social-welfare/extra-social-welfare-benefits/fuel-allowance/)

You should tell the DSP that you have started work on the WSS scheme and ask
how your individual payments will be affected.

You can continue to get the WSS until you become eligible to apply for a [
State Pension ](/en/social-welfare/older-and-retired-people/state-pension-
contributory/) .
