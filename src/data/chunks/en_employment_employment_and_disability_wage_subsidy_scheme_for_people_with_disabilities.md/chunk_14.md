###  Frequency of payments to the employer

The Department of Social Protection (DSP) will generate a ‘wage subsidy
request’ on Welfare Partners for the workplace every 4 weeks. This will:

  * List all WSS participants who are employed at the workplace 
  * Specify the calendar dates for which the WSS payment is due for the employee(s) 

Each week, the employer should fill in the hours worked by each employee and
the total gross wage paid to them for the 4-weeks.

You should complete this online ‘wage subsidy request’ within 12 weeks of the
date of issue, or the wage subsidy may not be paid to you.

You can include periods of paid leave as hours worked, but the WSS payment may
be affected if the employee was getting a social welfare payment. Periods of
unpaid leave are not counted towards the WSS.

When no salary at all is being paid by the employer, no wage subsidy payment
will be made to the employer.
