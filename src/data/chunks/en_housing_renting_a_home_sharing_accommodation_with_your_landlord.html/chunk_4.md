##  Renting a room

If you are renting a room in your landlord's home, your situation is very
different. You do not have a standard tenancy agreement. Instead, you have a
licensee agreement with your landlord. This means that you are in the property
by the landlord’s consent or invitation. As a result, you cannot avail of the
type of protection that tenants are entitled to under the residential
tenancies legislation.

The position is the same if you are living with a spouse, child or parent of a
landlord and you do not have a tenancy agreement or written lease.

As you do not have the same rights as someone whose tenancy comes under the
landlord and tenant legislation, you should be aware of the following:

  * Your landlord is not obliged to provide you with a [ rent book ](/en/housing/renting-a-home/tenants-rights-and-responsibilities/rent-books/) or a statement of rent paid 
  * There is no legal requirement for your accommodation to meet [ minimum physical standards ](/en/housing/renting-a-home/tenants-rights-and-responsibilities/minimum-standards-for-rented-homes/) (unless you are a HAP tenant and then these minimum standards must be met) 
  * Any notice you may get of the termination of the tenancy is at your landlord's discretion (although the landlord is obliged to give reasonable notice, the specifics of this notice may vary) 
  * Your landlord is not obliged to [ register the tenancy ](/en/housing/renting-a-home/landlords-rights-and-responsibilities/registering-a-tenancy/) with the Residential Tenancies Board (RTB) 
  * You cannot use [ the RTB's dispute resolution service ](/en/housing/renting-a-home/disputes-between-landlords-and-tenants#lbc6be) if a disagreement arises between you and your landlord 
  * You are not protected by the [ Equal Status Acts 2000-2015 ](http://www.lawreform.ie/_fileupload/RevisedActs/WithAnnotations/HTML/EN_ACT_2000_0008.HTM) , which prohibits discrimination on grounds of gender, civil status, family status, age, race, religion, disability, sexual orientation and membership of the Traveller community – and also on the [ ‘housing assistance’ ground ](http://www.ihrec.ie/your-rights/housing-assistance.html)
