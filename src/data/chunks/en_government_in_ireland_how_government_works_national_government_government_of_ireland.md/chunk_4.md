###  The composition of the Government

[ Article 28 of Bunreacht na hÉireann
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/cons/en/html#part5) (the Irish
Constitution) sets out the composition of Government. The Constitution states
that the Government must not be smaller than 7 members or larger than 15
members.

The members of the Government must be members of either Dáil Éireann or [
Seanad Éireann ](/en/government-in-ireland/houses-of-the-oireachtas/the-
seanad/) . There cannot be more than 2 members of Seanad Éireann appointed to
the Government. The Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and the Minister for Finance must
be members of Dáil Éireann.

The Taoiseach may also appoint Ministers of State who are also known as Junior
Ministers. They are not actually members of the Cabinet but they help
Government ministers in their parliamentary and departmental work.

The Taoiseach also appoints an Attorney General to advise the Government on
legal issues. The Attorney General is not a member of the Government but they
traditionally attend Cabinet meetings.
