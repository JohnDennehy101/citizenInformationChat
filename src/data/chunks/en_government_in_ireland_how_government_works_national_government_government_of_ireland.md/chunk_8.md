##  The Government Chief Whip

The Government Chief Whip is the Minister of State for the Department of the
Taoiseach. They are responsible for the organisation and co-ordination of
Government business in Dáil Éireann.

The Chief Whip acts as a channel of communication between the Government and
the opposition parties.

The Chief Whip is also responsible for making sure that the Government has a
voting majority in the Dáil by making sure that TDs attend Dáil sessions when
a vote is being taken. To instruct a TD to attend to vote, he or she can issue
a whip.

If a Government TD votes against the Government, they may lose the whip. This
means that they are suspended from the party. The Taoiseach can decide to
restore a TD’s whip.

The Chief Whip has a function in monitoring the progress made by Government
departments in preparing legislation. They also arrange for the proposed
legislation to be considered and debated in the Dáil.
