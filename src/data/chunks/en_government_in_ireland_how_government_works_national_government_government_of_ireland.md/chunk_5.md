###  Coalition governments

If, after a general election, no party can get the support of the majority of
the members of the D치il, 2 or more parties may agree to work together as a
coalition government.

The coalition parties agree on who will be nominated as Taoiseach. Usually, it
is the leader of the larger party. In recent years, the leader of the smaller
party has been usually nominated as T치naiste.

The ministerial portfolios are then shared between the parties. Usually the
larger party is given a greater number of portfolios. The leader of each party
decides which elected members of the party to give those portfolios to.

The coalition government remains in power for as long as it keeps the support
of the majority of the D치il. If the coalition parties find that they cannot
agree and can no longer work together, the Taoiseach may advise the President
to dissolve the D치il.
