##  The T치naiste

The T치naiste is the deputy Taoiseach.

They act in place of the Taoiseach if the Taoiseach is abroad or ill. If the
Taoiseach dies or becomes permanently incapacitated, the Tanaiste would stand
in until a new Taoiseach was appointed.

The T치naiste may also hold a ministerial portfolio, which means that they may
also be a minister of a [ Department of State ](/en/government-in-ireland/how-
government-works/national-government/departments-of-state/) .

Like the other members of the Government, the T치naiste may be dismissed by the
Taoiseach if they consider that there is sufficient reason to do so.
