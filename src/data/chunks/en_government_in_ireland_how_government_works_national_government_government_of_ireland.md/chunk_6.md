##  The Taoiseach

The Taoiseach is the head of the Government. Taoiseach means ‘leader’ or
‘chief’ in Irish, but the Irish word is always used for referring to the head
of Government in Ireland.

The Taoiseach acts as a channel of communication between the Government and [
the President ](/en/government-in-ireland/houses-of-the-oireachtas/president-
introduction-to-the-president-of-ireland/) . They advise the President about
summoning and dissolving the Dáil. They present Bills (or proposals for
legislation) to the President for signature so that they can become Acts with
legal effect. The Taoiseach also keeps the President generally informed on
domestic and international policy matters.

As the leading public figure in the Government, the Taoiseach also acts as a
spokesperson for the Government on major policy issues and chairs Cabinet
meetings.

They take an interest in the affairs of all the Departments of State and make
sure that the plans of departments are co-ordinated. They make sure that
Cabinet decisions are carried out by the ministers and that the ministers
fully understand the implications of different Government policies.

The Taoiseach also has a major role to play in our relations with foreign
countries. They represent Ireland abroad and regularly meets with the other
heads of state of the [ European Union ](/en/government-in-ireland/european-
government/european-union/european-union/) to help shape European policy. The
Taoiseach is Ireland’s representative on the [ European Council
](/en/government-in-ireland/european-government/eu-institutions/european-
council/) .

The Taoiseach and all the ministers are answerable to Dáil Eireann. The
Taoiseach is assisted in his or her duties by the Government Chief Whip.
