##  Step 3: Prepare for Irish border control

All citizens of non-EEA countries, whether they need a visa or preclearance,
must go through immigration control when they arrive in Ireland. Your partner
should tell the immigration officer at the airport or point of entry that they
plan to apply for residency in Ireland, based on their relationship with you.

If your partner is allowed to enter Ireland, the immigration officer will
place a landing stamp in their passport. The landing stamp gives them
permission to stay in Ireland up to the date indicated or for a maximum of 3
months.

At immigration control, your partner should expect to be asked for the
following documents at a minimum:

  * Valid passport 
  * D visa (if they are from a visa-required country) 
  * Immigration preclearance letter (if they are not from a visa-required country)
