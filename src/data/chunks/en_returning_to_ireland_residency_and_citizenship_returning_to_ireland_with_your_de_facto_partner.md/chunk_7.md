####  **Partners who do not need a visa**

Citizens of many countries do not need a visa to enter Ireland (for example,
Australia, Canada, and the United States). **Even if your partner does not
need a visa, they must still apply for immigration preclearance** by
completing the [ online preclearance application form for de facto partners of
Irish nationals ](https://www.visas.inis.gov.ie/AVATS/OnlineHome.aspx) and
submitting all the [ supporting documentation
](https://www.irishimmigration.ie/coming-to-join-family-in-ireland/joining-an-
irish-national/de-facto-partner-of-an-irish-national/#documents-required) ,
along with a [ non-refundable preclearance application fee
](https://www.irishimmigration.ie/preclearance-and-entry-visas-fees/) .

In their application, they should make it clear that the purpose of the
application is to join you, their partner (an Irish national) in Ireland. The
ISD website explains how to [ complete the online application form
](https://www.irishimmigration.ie/coming-to-join-family-in-ireland/joining-an-
irish-national/de-facto-partner-of-an-irish-national/#step1) if your partner
requires preclearance.
