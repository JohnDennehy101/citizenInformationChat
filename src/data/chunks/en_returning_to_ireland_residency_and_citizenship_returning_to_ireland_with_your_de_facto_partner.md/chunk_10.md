####  **Checking the progress of the application**

Your partner can use their reference number to check the progress of the
application. [ Decisions made by the Dublin office are published on the ISD
website ](https://www.irishimmigration.ie/visa-decisions/#recent) every
Tuesday by reference number.

Visa decisions at other visa offices can be accessed through [ the links
provided on the ISD website ](https://www.irishimmigration.ie/visa-
decisions/#decisions) .

If your partner’s application is refused, under most circumstances they can
appeal this decision within 8 weeks of the date of the refusal letter. The
appeal process is free, and they can appeal once. The appeal should address
the reasons for refusal stated in the refusal letter and provide extra
supporting documents if possible. The refusal letter will say where your
appeal should be sent.

Your partner cannot travel to Ireland until their visa is granted or their
preclearance letter is received

If your partner’s application is approved, this only allows your partner to
travel to Ireland for a specific purpose. This does not give your de facto
partner [ permission to enter Ireland
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/moving-country/visas-for-
ireland/permission-to-land-in-ireland/) or to stay here. An Immigration
Officer at border control can refuse you entry even if you have a preclearance
letter or long stay visa.

The visa or preclearance letter is valid for 6 months. If your partner does
not travel to Ireland within these 6 months, they must submit a new
application.

Your partner will need their visa or preclearance letter to:

  * Cross border control into Ireland and to finalise their permission to enter the State 
  * [ Register with immigration ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/moving-country/moving-to-ireland/rights-of-residence-in-ireland/registration-of-non-eea-nationals-in-ireland/) after they arrive in Ireland
