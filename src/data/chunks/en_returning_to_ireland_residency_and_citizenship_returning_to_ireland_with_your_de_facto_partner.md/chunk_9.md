##  Step 2: Send in your application

Whether you are sending in a visa application or a preclearance application,
this part of the process is the same.

Once they have completed the online application form (for visa or
preclearance), they will be given a summary application form. This will
include:

  * The address to send the signed form and supporting documents to (usually the Irish Embassy or Consulate nearest to them) 
  * Details of the fee and how to pay 
  * The reference number for their application 

Your partner should print out and sign this summary application form.

Your partner will need to get several [ supporting documents

irish-national/de-facto-partner-of-an-irish-national/#documents-required) to
send in with the application. Your partner must submit these documents and
signed application form **within 30 days of completing the online
application** .

The address your partner needs to send the application to depends on where
they are living.
