##  Introduction

The partner of an Irish citizen does not have an automatic right to stay in
Ireland if they are not a national of the [ European Economic Area (EEA)
](https://enterprise.gov.ie/en/what-we-do/workplace-and-skills/employment-
permits/employment-permit-eligibility/who-needs-an-employment-
permit-/european-economic-area-eea-/) , UK, or Switzerland.

If you are returning to Ireland with your non-EEA de facto partner, or you
want them to join you in Ireland, your partner will need permission from [
Immigration Service Delivery (ISD) ](https://www.irishimmigration.ie/) to live
with you in Ireland.

If your partner is a citizen of Ukraine, **they do not need a visa or
preclearance** . You can read [ coming to Ireland from Ukraine
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/moving-country/asylum-seekers-and-
refugees/the-asylum-process-in-ireland/coming-to-ireland-from-ukraine/) for
more information.

Your partner should be aware of [ processing times for preclearance and visa
applications ](https://www.irishimmigration.ie/visa-decisions/#processing) .
They are advised not to make any travel arrangements until they get a decision
on their visa or preclearance.

This page provides a step-by-step guide to the immigration process for your de
facto partner who does not yet live in Ireland.

If your partner is already living in Ireland, ISD has information on [ how to
apply for a de facto immigration permission
](https://www.irishimmigration.ie/my-situation-has-changed-since-i-arrived-in-
ireland/de-facto-partner-of-an-irish-or-non-eea-national/) .
