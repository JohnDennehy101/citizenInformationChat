####  **Location your partner applies from**

Your partner must apply from their home country or a country where they are
legally resident. They must remain outside of Ireland while their application
is processed. They may also need to provide proof of residence outside of
Ireland. If your partner is already living in Ireland, they do not need to
apply for a visa. ISD has information on [ how to apply for a de facto
immigration permission if you already living in Ireland.
