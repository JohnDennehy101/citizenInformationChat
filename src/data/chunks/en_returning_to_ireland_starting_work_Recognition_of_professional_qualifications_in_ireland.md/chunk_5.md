##  Can I use my UK professional qualifications in Ireland after Brexit?

Since 1 January 2021, [ mutual recognition of professional qualifications
](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/ee9f4-further-and-higher-education-and-
brexit/#professional-qualifications) (MRPQ) between the EU (including Ireland)
and the UK no longer applies.

If you are an Irish citizen who got your professional qualification in the UK,
you now need to get that qualification recognised in Ireland or in any other
EU member state where you intend to work. UK nationals must also do this.

Qualifications from the UK were automatically recognised in Ireland during the
[ transition period ](/en/government-in-ireland/ireland-and-the-uk/what-is-
brexit#lfcaf2) (from 1 February to 31 December 2020). If your qualification
was recognised during this time, you donâ€™t have to do anything and can
continue to practice in Ireland or the EU.

If you have a query about your UK qualification being recognised in Ireland
since Brexit, you should contact the [ regulatory body for your profession
](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/d7527-professional-qualifications-
recognition/#contacts) .

The Gov.ie website will be updated with any new information about [
professional qualifications recognition
](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/869e17-studying/) .
