###  How do you get your foreign qualification recognised?

The first step to getting your foreign qualification recognised is to contact
the competent authority for that profession in Ireland. You must do this
whether or not your profession is automatically recognised in Ireland. You
must also do this if you have an EPC.

If you do not find your profession on this [ list of competent authorities
](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/d7527-professional-qualifications-
recognition/#contacts) , you can email [ qualifications@dfheris.gov.ie
](mailto:Qualifications@dfheris.gov.ie) .

See the table below for some examples of regulated professions in Ireland.
