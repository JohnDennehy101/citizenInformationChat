###  What happens if my baby is in hospital?

If your baby is in hospital you can postpone your parent’s leave and Parent’s
Benefit or the portion of it that remains. However, you must start your
parent’s leave and Parent’s Benefit within 7 days of your child’s discharge
from hospital.

If you want to change your leave dates because your baby is in hospital you
can do this through [ MyWelfare.ie ](https://www.mywelfare.ie/Account/Login) .
If you are unable to do that or your leave is due to start within the next 10
days, you can send a letter directly to the Parent’s Benefit section (see
‘Where to apply’ below) telling them of your new leave dates.
