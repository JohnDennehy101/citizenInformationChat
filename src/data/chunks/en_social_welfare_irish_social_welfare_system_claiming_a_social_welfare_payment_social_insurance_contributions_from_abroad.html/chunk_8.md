##  How your social insurance contributions under bilateral social security
agreements are calculated

You must have been in insurable employment for at least one week in Ireland
for a bilateral social security agreement to apply and (except in the case of
Guardianâ€™s Payment (Contributory)) have a minimum of 52 reckonable weeks under
Irish legislation. When calculating your entitlement to an Irish social
insurance payment under a bilateral social security agreement, your reckonable
contributions from the country with which Ireland has the agreement and your
Irish contributions are used in a pro-rata formula to find out if you qualify
for a payment.

If you have worked in more than one country with which Ireland has a bilateral
social security agreement, your entitlement to an Irish social insurance
payment will be assessed under each agreement separately. Contributions paid
under different bilateral agreements cannot be combined, each must be
calculated separately. The calculation that provides the highest amount is
paid.

If you apply for a long-term social insurance payment in Ireland and put in
your application that you have worked in a country with which Ireland has a
bilateral social security agreement, the Department of Social Protection will
do the following:

  * If you have enough Irish social insurance contributions to get an Irish payment the Department will pay it and also initiate, on your behalf, a claim in the other country you worked in 
  * If you do not have enough social insurance contributions the Department will request your social insurance record from the other country to help you qualify for an Irish social insurance payment and also initiate, on your behalf, a claim in the other country that you have worked. This means you may get more than one payment, for example, you may get an Irish payment and a payment from another country.
