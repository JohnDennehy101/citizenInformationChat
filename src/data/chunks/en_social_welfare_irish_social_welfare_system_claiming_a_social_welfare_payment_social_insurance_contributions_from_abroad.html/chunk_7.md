The bilateral social security agreements are of greatest relevance for
pensioners who retire to Ireland after working in one of the countries listed

If you have come from a country with which Ireland has a bilateral social
security agreement, your pension rights from the other country are protected
when you move to Ireland. It is possible to have a pension from Ireland and
one or all of the other countries. You may be able to use your insurance
records from Ireland and the other country to qualify for a [ State Pension
(Contributory) ](/en/social-welfare/older-and-retired-people/state-pension-
