##  How your social insurance contributions under EU Regulations are
calculated

When calculating your entitlement to an Irish social insurance payment under
EU regulations, all your reckonable contributions from countries covered by
the regulations are combined. They can be used with your Irish contributions
to help you qualify for a payment.

You should get forms U1 (formerly E301) and E104 when you leave an EU country
where you have worked. These forms are available at the relevant social
security agency in the country you are coming from and provide details of your
social insurance record. Form E104 is needed if you apply for sickness
benefits and form U1 is required for unemployment benefits.

For example, if you are applying for Illness Benefit, send a copy of your E104
with your application for Illness Benefit. It will speed up the processing of
your application. If you don’t have form E104 from the relevant EU countries
you have worked in, once you state the other countries you have worked in on
your application form, the Department of Social Protection will get the
relevant details for you.

When applying for Invalidity Pension, each EU country is classified as either
a Type A or a Type B country. Your Invalidity Pension will be calculated
differently depending on whether you have worked in a Type A or Type B country
- see ‘Invalidity Pension’ under Further Information below.

Before coming to Ireland, you should check with the local social security
office in the country you are working in about the appropriate documentation
to bring with you. For State pensions, the DSP requests your social insurance
contribution history directly from the other state.
