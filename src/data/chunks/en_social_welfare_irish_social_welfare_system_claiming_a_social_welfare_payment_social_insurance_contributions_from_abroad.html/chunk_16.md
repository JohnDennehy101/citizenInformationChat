###  Invalidity Pension

Articles 44-49 of [ Regulation EEC No. 883/2004 (pdf) ](http://eur-
lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2004:166:0001:0123:en:PDF)
outlines how social insurance contributions from abroad are calculated for
Invalidity Pension.

Each EU country is classed as either a Type A or Type B country, depending on
how it calculates pensions. Thereâ€™s a [ list of Type A and Type B countries
](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/79a358-operational-guidelines-invalidity-
pension/#special-categories) on [ gov.ie
](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/79a358-operational-guidelines-invalidity-
pension/) . Ireland is a Type A country.

If you have worked in Ireland and another Type A country, the country where
your incapacity for work and invalidity occurred pays you the full Invalidity
Pension.

If you have worked in Ireland and a Type B country, or in a country with which
Ireland has a Bi-lateral Social Welfare Agreement, your pension will be
calculated on a pro-rata basis. Each country pays you a partial pension,
depending on your contribution record there.

The rate is calculated using the following formula:

(A/B) x C

  * A = number of Irish contributions 
  * B = total contributions (number of Irish contributions + contributions outside Ireland) 
  * C = current personal Invalidity Pension rate 

Where an Increase for a Qualified Adult (IQA) is also payable, this is also
paid on a pro-rata basis.

You must have a minimum of 52 contributions or credits in Ireland with at
least 1 of these being a paid contribution.
