###  Caring for more than one person

If 2 people live together and both need full-time care and attention, you can
get carer’s leave for each of them. In this case, the total maximum amount of
carer’s leave is 208 weeks (104 for each person in your care).

When your carer’s leave has finished, you must wait 6 months before you can
take another period of carer’s leave to care for a different person.
