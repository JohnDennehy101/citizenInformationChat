###  Can I work while on carer’s leave?

You can work for up to 18.5 hours a week in employment or self-employment
while you are on carer’s leave, as long as you earn less than €450 a week.
(This is your take-home pay after deductions such as tax, PRSI and union
dues.)

Alternatively, you can attend an educational or training course or do
voluntary work for a maximum of 18.5 hours a week.

Before you start work or training you should tell the Carer’s Benefit section
– see ‘Where to apply’ below. While you are out of the house, the person you
are caring for must be well looked after. You can read more about [ Carer’s
Benefit ](/en/social-welfare/carers/carers-benefit/) .
