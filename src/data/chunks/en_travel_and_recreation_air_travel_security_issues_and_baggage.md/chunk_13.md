###  Label your luggage

Every piece of your checked baggage (the baggage or luggage that you hand over
to the airline when you check in) must be clearly labelled with your name and
destination address. It is also advisable to place a similar label inside each
piece of baggage. Sometimes, airlines provide these labels free of charge when
you check in.

You should remove all tags and labels from previous flights; they may cause
your baggage to be delayed or misplaced.
