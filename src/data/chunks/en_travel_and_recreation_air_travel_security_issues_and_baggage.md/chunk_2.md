##  Introduction

As part of air transport security measures, you are not allowed to bring
certain items into a restricted area of an Irish airport or on board a plane
leaving an EU airport. This is because these items have the potential to be
used as weapons. The rules about air transport security are in place
internationally and have become more stringent in recent years.

If you are unsure about any security issue, or if you want to bring certain
goods when flying, you should contact your airline directly for advice before
flying. Understanding which items are forbidden on board a plane will help you
plan the contents of your baggage accordingly.
