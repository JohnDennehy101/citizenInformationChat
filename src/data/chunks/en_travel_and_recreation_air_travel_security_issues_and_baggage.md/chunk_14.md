###  At the check-in desk

Before presenting your baggage at check-in, ensure it is securely closed and
if possible locked. When it is accepted at the check-in desk, each item of
checked baggage will be given a destination tag showing your flight number and
a receipt portion will be attached to your ticket. It is important to keep
this receipt as it has important information about your flight details. It
will help you track your baggage if it is delayed or misplaced.

Ensure the tag shows the correct destination and flight number and, if you are
making connections en route, that your baggage is checked to your final
destination.
