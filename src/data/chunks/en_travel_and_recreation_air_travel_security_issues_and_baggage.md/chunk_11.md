You may still pack liquids in luggage that you check in; these restrictions
only apply to hand luggage. You can also carry any medicines and dietary
requirements (including baby foods and baby milk) for use during the trip in
your hand luggage. However, you may be asked for proof of authenticity. These
can be in containers over 100 mls but you must remove them from your carry-on
bag and show them separately during screening.

You may also buy liquids (such as drinks and perfumes) either in an EU shop
beyond the point where you show your boarding pass or on board a plane
operated by an EU airline. If these items are sold in a special sealed bag -
don't open the bag before you are screened, as the contents may be confiscated
at the checkpoint. The European Commission has produced these [ Frequently
Asked Questions on the carriage of liquids as hand luggage
