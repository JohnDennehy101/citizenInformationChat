###  **Exceptions**

There are situations where employers are not considered penalising part-time
employees. For example, your employer asks you to change from full-time to
part-time work (or the opposite).

However, the following conditions apply:

  * Your employer must have substantial grounds to justify the request and to take any action after your refusal 
  * Any action taken by your employer must follow the terms in your [ contract of employment ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/employment/employment-rights-and-conditions/contracts-of-employment/contract-of-employment/) and employment rights legislation
