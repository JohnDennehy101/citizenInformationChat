###  **What are objective grounds for different treatment?**

Employers can treat you less favourably if they have _objective grounds_ .
This means the difference in treatment is appropriate and necessary for a
legitimate business purpose.

An example of objective grounds could be not providing you with health
insurance, even though full-time workers get health insurance. This could be
justified because itâ€™s more costly for your employer to provide insurance to
part-time employees.

Objective grounds for treating part-time workers less favourably than full-
time workers may be different for _casual_ part-time employees.
