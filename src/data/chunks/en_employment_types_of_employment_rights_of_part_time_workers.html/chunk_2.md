##  Introduction

If you work part-time, you have the right to be treated fairly compared to
your full-time co-workers.

The rights of part-time employees are protected in law. You cannot generally
be treated _less favourably_ – in other words, you must be treated **at least
as well as** comparable full-time employees.
