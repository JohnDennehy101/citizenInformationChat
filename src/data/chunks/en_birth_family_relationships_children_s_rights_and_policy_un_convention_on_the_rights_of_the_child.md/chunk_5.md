##  The rules for making a complaint

A complaint may be submitted to the Committee by a child (or a group of
children) claiming to be a victim of a violation of the Convention and/or the
Optional Protocols.

A complaint may also be submitted by their designated representative, or by
others acting on behalf of the alleged victim with their permission.

Where there is a concern that the victimâ€™s consent may be the result of
improper pressure or encouragement, the Committee may request additional
information to ensure that the complaint is in the best interests of the
child.

A complaint may also be submitted on behalf of the alleged victim without
their consent. However, in this case, the representative will have to justify
submitting the complaint.

The Committee will not accept a complaint if:

  * It is anonymous 
  * It is not in writing 
  * It constitutes an abuse of the right of submission of such complaints or is incompatible with the provisions of the Convention and/or the Optional Protocols 
  * The same matter has already been examined by the Committee or has been or is being examined under another procedure of international investigation or settlement 
  * All available domestic remedies have not been exhausted unless the application of the remedies is unreasonably prolonged or unlikely to bring effective relief 
  * The complaint is clearly ill-founded or not sufficiently substantiated 
  * The facts that are the subject of the complaint occurred before the Third Protocol came into force for the country concerned, unless those facts continued after that date 
  * The complaint is not submitted within one year after the exhaustion of domestic remedies, except in cases where it can be shown that it was not possible to submit the communication within that time limit
