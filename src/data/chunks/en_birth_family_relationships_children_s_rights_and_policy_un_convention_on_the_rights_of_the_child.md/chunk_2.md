##  Introduction

The [ United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child
](http://www.ohchr.org/EN/ProfessionalInterest/Pages/CRC.aspx) sets out the
basic human rights to which every child is entitled. These include:

  * Survival rights such as nutrition, shelter and access to medical services 
  * Development rights such as education, access to information and freedom of thought 
  * Protection rights such as protection from abuse, neglect and exploitation 
  * Participation rights such expression of opinions and taking part in social and cultural activities 

The Convention protects these rights by setting minimum standards that
governments must meet in providing healthcare, education and legal and social
services to children in their countries.

The Convention came into force in September 1990. Ireland ratified the
Convention on 28 September 1992.

In 2002, two Optional Protocols to the Convention came into force:

  * [ Optional Protocol on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography ](http://www.ohchr.org/EN/ProfessionalInterest/Pages/OPSCCRC.aspx) (not yet ratified by Ireland) 
  * [ Optional Protocol on the involvement of children in armed conflict ](http://www.ohchr.org/EN/ProfessionalInterest/Pages/OPACCRC.aspx) (ratified by Ireland in 2002) 

Optional Protocols complement and add to existing treaties. They are
‘optional’ because the obligations may be more demanding than those in the
original convention, so countries must independently choose whether or not to
be bound by them.
