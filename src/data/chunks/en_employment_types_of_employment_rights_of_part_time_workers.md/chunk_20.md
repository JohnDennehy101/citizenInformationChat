###  **If your request for part-time working is refused**

If your employer refuses your request for part-time work, they must give you a
reason for the refusal (for example, that the change would lead to staffing
difficulties).

If you are unhappy with your employer’s response and you believe they have
breached your employment rights, you can make a complaint to the WRC – read
‘Making a complaint’ below.
