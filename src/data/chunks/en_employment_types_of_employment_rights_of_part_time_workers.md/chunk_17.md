##  Switching to part-time

If you are a full-time worker and you want to switch to part-time, you have
the right to ask your employer. Your employer does not have to agree, but they
should think about ways to make part-time work accessible to employees. Read
the WRCâ€™s [ Code of Practice on Access to Part-Time Work
](https://www.workplacerelations.ie/en/what_you_should_know/codes_practice/cop7/)
.

Your employer should consider your request for part-time working without
discrimination, in line with [ employment equality legislation
](http://www.ihrec.ie/publications/list/ihrec-employment-equality-rights-
explained/) .
