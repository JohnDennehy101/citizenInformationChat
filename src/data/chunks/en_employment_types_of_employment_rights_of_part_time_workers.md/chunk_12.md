###  **PAYE**

PAYE is an _income tax_ , which is deducted from your wages by your employer
using Revenue’s ‘ [ Pay As You Earn
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/money-and-tax/tax/income-tax/how-your-
tax-is-calculated/) ’ system.

The rate of tax you pay depends on:

  * Your income or salary, and 
  * Your _tax credits_ (tax credits reduce the amount of income tax you must pay) 

Read about [ how your income tax is calculated
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/money-and-tax/tax/income-tax/how-your-
tax-is-calculated/) . If your tax credits are more than your _gross tax_ (your
total tax due), you do not have to pay any income tax.
