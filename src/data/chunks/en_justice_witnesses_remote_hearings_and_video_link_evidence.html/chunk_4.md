##  Video link evidence in criminal cases

If you are giving evidence by video link you donâ€™t need to go into the
courtroom. Instead you can sit in another room or venue and give your evidence
by live video link. A television monitor is placed in the court, which
transmits your image, and you have a screen in your room that transmits the
image of what is happening in the courtroom.

In criminal proceedings, there are certain situations where video link
evidence has been acceptable for a number of years. These include:

  * If the proceedings involve a sexual or violent offence, the victim and any other witness may be allowed to give their evidence by live video link, if they are under 18 years of age, or for any other reason that [ the judge ](/en/justice/courtroom/judge/) allows 
  * If the judge thinks it is necessary to protect the victim from further victimisation, the victim can give evidence by live video link 

When a child gives evidence by live video link, the judge and the barristers
do not wear wigs or gowns in court. The judge can decide to let an
intermediary (for example, a social worker) ask the witness questions. The
questions should be asked in a way that is appropriate for the age and mental
ability of the witness.

From 14 September 2020, additional uses of video link evidence were
introduced:

  * The types of hearings permitted to be conducted by video link were widened to include arraignments (where an accused is asked to enter a plea), returns for trial, sentencing hearings and certain hearings in relation to extradition. Criminal trials are still conducted physically. 
  * These hearings also cover persons not in custody, allowing any accused person to attend by video link where the court so directs. A court can also decide that some applications may be heard by video link by default. The accused must either be legally represented, have obtained legal advice or have been given the opportunity to obtain legal advice before video link can be used. 
  * If hearing the evidence using video link is prejudicial to the accused or contrary to the interests of justice, or if adequate video link facilities are not available or otherwise inappropriate, the application will be dealt with in the traditional, physical manner. 
  * A witness, other than the accused, may also be allowed to give evidence remotely over video link in these criminal applications, even if they are not in the State. 

Those taking part in such applications in criminal cases will continue to
benefit from the same protections as if they were in physical attendance in
court and the court will have the same powers.
