##  Introduction

Traditionally, almost all court hearings were conducted in courtrooms with all
participants being physically present. Witnesses were required to attend to
give oral evidence except in limited circumstances. Video link evidence was
permitted in limited circumstances in criminal cases under the [ Criminal
Evidence Act 1992
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1992/en/act/pub/0012/sec0013.html) .

The [ Civil Law and Criminal Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2020
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2020/act/13/enacted/en/html) now allows
for a much wider use of remote hearings than has been the case to date. It
also extends the use of video link evidence in a number of criminal matters.

Remote hearings involve some or all of the participants logging in to an
online platform where the case is otherwise conducted as it would physically
in court. If the judges or barristers are not in the courtroom, they will not
be wearing robes or wigs.

Remote hearings and video link evidence are not suitable for all types of case
and protections have been provided to ensure that no one will be unfairly
prejudiced by a remote hearing or video link evidence.
