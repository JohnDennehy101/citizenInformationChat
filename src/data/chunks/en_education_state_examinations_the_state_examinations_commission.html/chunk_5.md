###  Online services  

The SEC provides online services such as :

  * [ Candidate Self Service Portal ](https://www.examinations.ie/cssp/2023/) where candidates can see their results, view marks, apply to view and view scripts 
  * Online Appeals Payment Service 
  * [ Online External Candidate Application Service ](https://www.examinations.ie/?l=en&mc=ca&sc=ec)

These services are not intended to replace the service and advice provided by
schools but are intended as an alternative service for candidates who cannot
avail of the results service offered by their schools.
