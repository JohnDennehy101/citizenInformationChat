##  Summary of social housing assessments

Every year, each local authority must prepare a summary of the social housing
assessments carried out in its area. They contact all households on their
housing lists to confirm that they still qualify for social housing support.
They also request up-to-date information about income, family size and current
housing conditions.

It is important for all households to respond to the local authority with the
details requested. If your address has changed since you went on the housing
list, you should contact the local authority and give your current address.
