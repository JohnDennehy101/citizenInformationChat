###  While you are on the housing list

Each local authority draws up its own rules for deciding the order of priority
on their social housing waiting list. These are called housing allocation
schemes and are published on the local authority’s website.

Most local authorities prioritise people who have been on the waiting list the
longest. They may also operate a points system, giving each household on the
list a number of points depending on their circumstances.

Your position may go up or down on the list depending on the circumstances of
other people on the list and if your own circumstances change. In practice,
priority is generally given to families and older people rather than single
people or couples without children.

Local authorities also have specific waiting lists for:

  * Older person accommodation (generally for people over 55 years) 
  * People who are homeless 
  * Traveller-specific accommodation 

**If your circumstances change while on the waiting list**

If your circumstances change while you are on the list, you should tell the
local authority so they can update your household’s record. For example, if
you have a new baby or someone leaves your household. You should also tell
your local authority if your address changes.

**How to find out where you are on the waiting list**

If you want to know your position on the housing list, you can ask your local
authority. You can also ask your local authority to give you an estimate of
the waiting time for a home.
