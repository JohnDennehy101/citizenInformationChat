##  Funding supports for apprenticeships

There are a number of supports for apprentices and employers. You can check
for supports on the [ apprenticeship.ie ](https://apprenticeship.ie/) website
and with your local ETB.

**Apprentice supports**

There are financial supports to help young people from under-represented
groups, those leaving care and the Traveling community to access
apprenticeships.

  * The [ Access and Inclusion bursary ](https://apprenticeship.ie/news-events/news/access-and-inclusion-bursary) supports young people from under-represented groups into national apprenticeships. 
  * The [ Traveller Apprenticeship Incentivisation Programme (TAIP) ](https://www.gov.ie/en/press-release/01abc-minister-harris-announces-roll-out-of-450000-in-funding-for-travellers-in-apprenticeships/) offers a limited number of bursaries to members of the Traveller community. 
  * The [ Apprenticeship Bursary for Care Leavers ](https://www.gov.ie/en/press-release/e2a6a-minister-harris-announces-funding-of-115-million-to-support-care-leavers-and-members-of-the-traveller-and-roma-communities/) will be available to support [ care leavers ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/birth-family-relationships/services-and-supports-for-children/children-in-care/#l53210) to take up an apprenticeship in 2024. 

The bursaries can provide up to €3,000. You can request an application form

Certain employers who provide apprenticeships can get an [ apprenticeship

employer-grant-2022) of €2,000 per year for each registered apprentice.

Employers can get a [ gender-based bursary ](https://www.gov.ie/en/press-

Small and micro business employers can get financial and training supports
