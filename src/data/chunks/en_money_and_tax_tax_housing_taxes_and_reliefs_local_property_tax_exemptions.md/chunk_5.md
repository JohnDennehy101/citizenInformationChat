####  Property for someone who is permanently and totally incapacitated

If you are permanently and totally incapacitated, a property may be exempt
from LPT if it is bought, built or adapted for you as the only, or main, place
you live.

The exemption applies if the cost of the adaptations is more than 25% of the
market value of the property before adaptation.

If you do not qualify for exemption, you may qualify for a reduction in LPT if
you have a disability and the value of your home has increased because of
adaptation works.
