##  When can I register the death after a post-mortem?

In the case of a coronerâ€™s post-mortem, if the coroner decides that no inquest
needs to be held, the Registrar of Deaths will be notified, the death will be
registered and a death certificate will be issued. You will not need to
register the death yourself, but you will still need to collect the death
certificate. If the coroner decides that an inquest must be held the
registration of death will be delayed.

While waiting for the post-mortem report, the coroner may give you an Interim
Certificate of the Fact of Death. You may be able to use this instead of a
standard death certificate as acceptable evidence for banks, insurance
companies and other institutions, but you should check with each institution
that it meets their requirements.

In the case of a consent post-mortem you must register the death at any office
of the Register of Births, Deaths and Marriages by producing a medical
certificate stating the cause of death from the Doctor who attended the
patient.
