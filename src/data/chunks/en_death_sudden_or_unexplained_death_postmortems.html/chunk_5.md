###  Consent post-mortem

A doctor may ask for a post-mortem to find out more about an illness or for
medical research. This can help the family of the deceased, by identifying
inheritable issues, as well as more generally advancing medical care in the
future.

If a doctor wishes to do a post-mortem, they will ask for permission from the
next of kin. They will discuss the procedure with you and ask for your consent
to remove particular organs.
