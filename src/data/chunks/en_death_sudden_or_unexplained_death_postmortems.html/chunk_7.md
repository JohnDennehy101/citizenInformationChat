##  Will the post-mortem delay the funeral?

Generally, it will not. A post-mortem normally takes place within a few days
of death. You should not make any funeral arrangements until you have been
told the date on which the body will be released. A post-mortem examination
does not involve disfigurement of the body, which may be viewed afterwards in
the same manner as if no post-mortem had been performed.

In some cases you may have to wait several weeks to see the results of the
post-mortem.
