###  **Community Return Scheme**

Under the [ Community Return Scheme
](http://www.probation.ie/en/PB/Pages/WP16000037) , you can complete unpaid
community work as a condition of early release from your prison sentence.

Prisoners are assessed by the Probation Service and the [ Irish Prison Service
](https://www.irishprisons.ie/) to see if they are suitable for the scheme.

To be eligible, you must:

  * Be assessed as posing no threat to the community 
  * Be serving a sentence that is more than 1 year but less than 8 years 
  * Have served at least 50% of your sentence 

You must work on the days assigned for an agreed length of time. The work
usually takes place near the end of your sentence.
