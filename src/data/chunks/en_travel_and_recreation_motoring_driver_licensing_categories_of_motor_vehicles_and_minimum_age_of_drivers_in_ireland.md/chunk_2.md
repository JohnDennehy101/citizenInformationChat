##  Introduction

Motor vehicles in Ireland are divided into different categories for driver
licensing purposes. This is a standard practice throughout the [ European
Union ](/en/government-in-ireland/european-government/european-union/european-
union/) . Before you can apply for a licence to drive a vehicle in Ireland,
you must be a certain age.

The [ categories of vehicles ](https://www.ndls.ie/licence-categories.html)
you are allowed to drive and use are listed on your licence. It is a serious
offence to drive any vehicle for which you do not have a licence.

You are only allowed to drive the category of vehicle for which your licence
or permit has been issued.

If you want another category added, you may have to complete the application
process and a test. Your current licence must be in date if you want another
category added to your licence. Certain categories may be added automatically
to your licence and you do not need to do another test. For example, if you
have a licence to drive a car, you can automatically drive a tractor.
