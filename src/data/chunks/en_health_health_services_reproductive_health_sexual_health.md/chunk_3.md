##  What is a sexually transmitted infection (STI)?

A sexually transmitted infection (STI) is an infection you can get if you have
sexual activity with an infected person.

The [ HSE website sexualwellbeing.ie ](https://www.sexualwellbeing.ie/sexual-
health/sexually-transmitted-infections/types-of-stis/) has information on
sexual health and common STIs in Ireland such as chlamydia, syphilis, HIV and
others.

If you are worried about an STI, you should visit your GP, pharmacist or an [
STI clinic ](https://www.sexualwellbeing.ie/sexual-health/hse-sti-services-in-
ireland.html) for medical advice.

STIs do not always have [ symptoms ](https://www.sexualwellbeing.ie/sexual-
health/sexually-transmitted-infections/what-if-i-think-i-have-an-sti-/) .
Untreated STIs can cause serious health problems so it is important to get
tested regularly.
