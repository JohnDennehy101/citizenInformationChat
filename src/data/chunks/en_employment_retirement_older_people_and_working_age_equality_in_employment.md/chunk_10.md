##  When is it not considered discrimination?

There are certain situations where an employer may have to set age
restrictions in work.

An employer can:

  * Set a minimum age requirement (up to 18 years) when recruiting 
  * Set a maximum recruitment age where it would not be worthwhile financially for an older person to apply for the job. For example, where training is involved and there is not enough time for the employer to make back the costs of the training before the person retires 
  * Offer a fixed-term contract to a person over the compulsory retirement age once it is objectively justified 

For an occupational benefits scheme (also known as company or employersâ€™
pensions), an employer is allowed to treat employees different on the age
ground in certain circumstances.

The Pensions Authority has detailed guidance and examples of [ equal pension
treatment (pdf)
](https://www.pensionsauthority.ie/en/employers/checklists_and_guides/a_brief_guide_to_equal_pension_treatment3.pdf)
. Section 6.7 covers the age ground and allowed exceptions.
