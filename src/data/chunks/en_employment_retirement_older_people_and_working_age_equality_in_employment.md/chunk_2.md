##  Introduction

It is against the law to discriminate against anyone in employment based on
their age. This is set out in the [ Employment Equality Acts 1998-2015
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1998/en/act/pub/0021/index.html) , which
covers discrimination in the workplace.

The law on discrimination only applies to people aged 16 and over. However,
there are some exceptions to this. [ You can read more about the rights of

The law on young workers is set out in the [ Protection of Young Persons
(Employment) Act 1996
](https://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1996/act/16/enacted/en/html) .
