####  **I don’t get an IQC with my social welfare payment**

If you are getting a qualifying social welfare payment but you don’t get an
IQC, you can still claim BSCFA if:

  * The rules of your payment do not provide for a child payment (for example, [ Maternity Benefit ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/families-and-children/maternity-benefit/) and [ Adoptive Benefit ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/families-and-children/adoptive-benefit/) ), or 
  * Your spouse or partner's income is over the specified limit for your payment, but your overall household income is within the BSCFA income limits (see ‘Income limits’ below). 

You must meet the other rules for getting BSCFA.
