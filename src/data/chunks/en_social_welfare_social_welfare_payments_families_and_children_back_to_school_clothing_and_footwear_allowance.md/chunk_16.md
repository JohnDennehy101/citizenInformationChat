###  **Appealing a BSCFA decision**

If you are unhappy with the decision on your BSCFA application, you should
send a letter to the Back to School Clothing and Footwear Allowance Review
Section (see contact details under ‘More information’ below).

In your letter, you should:

  * Explain the reasons why you think the decision was incorrect 
  * Ask that your application be reviewed. 

You should ask for a review within 21 days of getting your decision.

You can’t appeal a BSCFA decision to the Social Welfare Appeals Office.
