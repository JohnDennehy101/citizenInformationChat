###  **I get the BSCFA automatically**

You don't need to apply for the Back to School Clothing and Footwear Allowance
(BSCFA) if you get the payment automatically.

The Department of Social Protection (DSP) will let you know if you are paid
automatically using your [ MyWelfare
](https://services.mywelfare.ie/en/topics/parents-children-family/) account,
or by post.

If you don’t hear from the DSP by the end of June, you must apply for BSCFA
online, even if you got the BSCFA payment last year. See ‘I don’t get the
BSCFA automatically’ below.
