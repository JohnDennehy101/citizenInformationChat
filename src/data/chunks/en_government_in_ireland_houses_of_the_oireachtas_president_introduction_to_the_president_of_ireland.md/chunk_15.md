###  Constitutional amendments

Before the Constitution can be amended, both Houses of the Oireachtas must
pass a Bill to amend it. The Irish people must then approve the Bill in a [
constitutional referendum ](/en/government-in-ireland/elections-and-
referenda/types-of-elections-and-referendums/constitutional-referendum-in-
ireland/) . If the Bill is approved in a referendum, the President must then
sign it so that the Constitution can be amended.
