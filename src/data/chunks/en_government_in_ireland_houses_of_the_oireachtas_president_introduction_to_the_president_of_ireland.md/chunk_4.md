###  Inauguration

After a [ presidential election ](/en/government-in-ireland/elections-and-
referenda/types-of-elections-and-referendums/presidential-election/) , the
candidate who has won becomes President of Ireland by publicly making the
declaration set out in Article 12(8) of the Constitution. If a former or
retiring President is re-elected unopposed, they make the declaration for a
second time. This happened when [ Mary McAleese
](https://www.president.ie/en/the-president/mary-mcaleese) became President
for a second term in 2004.

The President is inaugurated in St Patrick's Hall in [ Dublin Castle
](http://www.dublincastle.ie/) and makes the declaration in the presence of
members of both Houses of the Oireachtas, the judges of the [ Supreme Court
](/en/justice/courts-system/supreme-court/) , the [ Court of Appeal
](/en/justice/courts-system/court-of-appeal/) and the [ High Court
