###  The Presidential Commission

Article 14 of the Constitution provides for a Commission to perform the
functions of the President in certain situations – if the President is absent,
becomes incapacitated, resigns, is removed from office, dies or fails to
perform their functions.

The members of the Presidential Commission are the Chief Justice, the Ceann
Comhairle of the Dáil and the Cathaoirleach of the Seanad. If any member is
unable to act, the President of the Court of Appeal, the Leas (Deputy) Ceann
Comhairle and the Leas (Deputy) Cathaoirleach, respectively, can act as a
member instead. Any 2 of the members can carry out the President’s functions
when required.

The Commission frequently acts when the President is abroad - for example, by
signing Bills into law. It has also appointed members of the Government (on
the nomination of the Taoiseach and after approval by Dáil Éireann). It can
also dissolve Dáil Éireann on the advice of the Taoiseach – this happened in
1992, when the President was abroad.
