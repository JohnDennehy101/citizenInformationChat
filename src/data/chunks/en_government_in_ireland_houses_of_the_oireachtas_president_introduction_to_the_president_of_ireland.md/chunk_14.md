###  Referring bills to the Supreme Court

Under Article 26 of the Constitution, the President can decide to refer a Bill
to the Supreme Court (within 7 days of receiving it) to determine whether or
not the Bill conflicts with the Constitution. The President must first consult
with the Council of State, but the decision to refer the Bill is the
President's alone.

If the Supreme Court holds that the Bill is [ unconstitutional
](/en/government-in-ireland/how-government-works/standards-and-
accountability/unconstitutional-legislation-and-decisions/) , the President
cannot sign it. However, if the Court holds that the Bill is constitutional,
the President signs the Bill and it becomes law. In this situation, under [
Article 34 of the Constitution
](https://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/cons/en/html#part11) , the
constitutionality of this legislation (or of any part of it) cannot be
challenged at a later stage.

The power of referral to the Supreme Court has been used several times â€“ see [
