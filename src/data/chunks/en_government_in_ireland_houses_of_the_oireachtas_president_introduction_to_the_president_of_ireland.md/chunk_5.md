###  End of the President’s term

The President’s full term of office is 7 years and no President can serve more
than 2 terms. Under Article 12(3) of the Constitution, a presidential election
must take place by the date on which the current President's term of office
expires but may not take place more than 60 days before this.

However, the President can choose to resign at any time during their term in
office. This happened when [ Mary Robinson ](https://president.ie/en/the-
president/mary-robinson) resigned in 1997.

There are also 2 situations when the President may be removed from office:

  1. Where at least 5 Supreme Court judges decide that the President has become permanently incapacitated. 
  2. Where the President is impeached by either House of the Oireachtas for stated misbehaviour. Stated misbehaviour might include a criminal offence or a misuse of the President's powers. Article 12 (10) of the Constitution sets out the procedures for impeachment. 

If the current President resigns, becomes incapacitated, is removed or dies,
then an election must be held within the following 60 days.
