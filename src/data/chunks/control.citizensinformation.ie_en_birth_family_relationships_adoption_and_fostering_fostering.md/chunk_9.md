###  Day foster care

This involves specially trained foster parents providing foster care for a
child on a daily basis. The child is not separated from their family, as they
go home each evening, yet benefit from the additional care offered in the
foster home. This type of care gives the child's own family an opportunity to
deal with difficulties each day as they arise. The aim of day foster care is
that the child can return home on a full-time basis.
