###  General foster care

When Tusla cannot find a suitable relative, or person known to the child, to
provide relative care, they place a child in general foster care. A general
foster carer has:

  * Been approved by Tusla 
  * Completed a process of assessment 
  * Been placed on the panel of approved foster carers to care for children in care 

Many of the children living in foster care have been with their foster
families for most of their lives. Others have shorter placements.

At the end of June 2022, almost 62% of children in care were in general foster
care.
