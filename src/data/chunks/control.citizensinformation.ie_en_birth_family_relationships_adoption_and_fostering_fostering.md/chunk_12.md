##  The foster child and their own family

When a child is placed in foster care on a daily, short-term or longer-term
basis, maintaining links with his or her own family is very important. The
child's own parents are involved as much as possible and are always kept fully
informed of how the child is getting on. The child will see their own family
as much as possible and even though they may live (even for a longer-term
period) with another family, the child's identity and name is their own.
