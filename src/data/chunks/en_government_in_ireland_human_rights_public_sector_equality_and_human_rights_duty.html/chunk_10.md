##  Human rights

Human rights are the basic universal rights that apply to everyone regardless
of race, sex, nationality or any other status. They include civil and
political rights like the right to life or the right to a fair trial, and
economic and social rights, like the right to work and the right to education.

Many human rights are not absolute. This means that they can be limited in
accordance with the law.

Human rights are set out in law. In Ireland, human rights are protected by:

  * The [ Irish Constitution ](/en/government-in-ireland/irish-constitution-1/constitution-fundamental-rights/) and national laws that protect human rights 
  * The European Convention on Human Rights 
  * The [ Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union ](/en/government-in-ireland/european-government/eu-law/charter-of-fundamental-rights/)
  * United Nations treaties that Ireland has ratified
