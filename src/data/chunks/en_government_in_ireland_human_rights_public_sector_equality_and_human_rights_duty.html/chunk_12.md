###  European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR)

Ireland was a founding member of the Council of Europe and has signed the
ECHR. Ireland has also put the ECHR on a statutory footing through the [
European Convention on Human Rights Act 2003
](https://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2003/act/20/enacted/en/print.html) .

Irish courts can declare that laws are incompatible with the ECHR, but they
cannot declare that the law is in invalid for this reason.

If your ECHR rights have been breached, you can take a case to the [ European
Court of Human Rights
](https://www.coe.int/en/web/tbilisi/europeancourtofhumanrights) . You can
only do this after you have taken all the legal steps available to you in
Ireland.
