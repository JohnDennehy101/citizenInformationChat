from the Courts Service website. If you want to change the name of a child by
deed poll, contact [ deedpollquery@courts.ie ](mailto:deedpollquery@courts.ie)
to request the necessary documentation (see Changing a childâ€™s name by Deed
Poll below).

The Deed Poll must be printed on deed paper (which is available from legal
stationers), or any high-quality paper. Deed paper is recommended so the
document lasts longer and in case there are any doubts about its authenticity.

In this form, you declare that you have given up your old name and adopted a
new name for all purposes.
