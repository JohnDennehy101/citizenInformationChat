###  Passport

To change your name on your passport back to your pre-marriage name (or pre-
civil partnership name), you need to apply for a new passport. You can apply
using [ Passport Online ](https://www.dfa.ie/passportonline/) .

You must submit:

  * Your previous passport 
  * Your birth certificate 
  * A judicial separation court order, separation agreement, or divorce decree. This must be certified by a solicitor or by the court 
  * Your original marriage or civil partnership certificate 

Otherwise, you must show ‘proof of usage’. To do this, submit 2 official
documents showing you have been using your pre-marriage name for 2 years. The
Passport Service does not accept deed polls to change the name on your Irish
passport.

documents you need, on the Department of Foreign Affairs website.
