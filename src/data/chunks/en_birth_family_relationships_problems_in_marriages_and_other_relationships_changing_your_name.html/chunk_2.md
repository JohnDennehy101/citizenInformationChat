##  How do I change my name?

Irish law does not set out how to change your name. This means you can change
the name you commonly use by simply using a new name.

However, you might have difficulty proving your new name to public and private
bodies (for example, your workplace, school, Revenue or the Passport Service)
without an official document referring to the change.
