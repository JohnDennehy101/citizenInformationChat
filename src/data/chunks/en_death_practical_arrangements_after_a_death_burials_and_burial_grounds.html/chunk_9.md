##  Legislation

The main rules for burial grounds are set out in the Rules & Regulations for
the Regulation of Burial Grounds 1888 and the relevant amending regulations.
Each local authority makes bye-laws in relation to the regulation of burial
grounds in their area.

They cover various matters including the allocation, size and purchase of
burial plots, the recording of burials, the maintenance of a register of
burials, and the requirements regarding headstones and monuments, as well the
depth of burials and first interments.

The [ Burial Ground (Amendment) Regulations 2013
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2013/si/144/made/en/print) amended the
1888 Regulations to allow for uncoffined burials in an area of a burial ground
designated exclusively for that purpose.
