###  Burial where the deceased has no means

If someone dies without the means to pay for burial and if this person has no
traceable next of kin, it is the responsibility of the Department of Social
Protection or local authority to ensure that the person is buried in a
dignified manner. The Department or local authority will also be liable for
the charges and costs involved in doing so.
