##  Introduction

**Primary legislation** is law that is passed by the Oireachtas (the Irish
parliament). Under the Constitution of Ireland, the Oireachtas is the only
institution of the Irish State that can make laws.

Legislation starts as a Bill. The bill must be passed by the Dáil and the
Seanad (the two Houses of the Oireachtas – the Irish parliament) before the
President can sign the bill into law. When it is signed by the President, the
Bill becomes an Act and is added to the Statute Book.

Bills must pass through a number of stages before they are voted on by the
members of the Oireachtas.

**Secondary legislation** includes Statutory Instruments and bye-laws. An Act
of the Oireachtas may delegate the power to enact secondary legislation to
another body – for example, a Minister or a local authority. The secondary
legislation must be consistent with the delegated powers permitted by the Act.
