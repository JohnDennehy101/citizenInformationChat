###  Drafting of the Bill

Sometimes, the Government publishes a _Green Paper_ before it drafts a Bill. A
Green Paper is a discussion document setting out ideas and inviting comment
and views from individuals and relevant organisations.

The ‘general scheme’ of the Bill is often published and sometimes undergoes
pre-legislative scrutiny by an Oireachtas Committee. The Committee may invite
representatives of groups who will be affected by the Bill to meet and discuss
the Bill.

A Private Member’s Bill is only scrutinised by an Oireachtas Committee if it
passes the second stage in the Dáil (see ‘Second stage’ below).
