###  Statutory Instruments

The majority of laws that are introduced each year are Statutory Instruments,
rather than Acts of the Oireachtas. In 2020, there were 32 Acts of the
Oireachtas signed into law, and 760 Statutory Instruments.

An SI is signed by a Minister under the powers given to the Minister by the
principal Act of the Oireacthas.

For example, [ Section 17 of the Immigration Act 2004
](https://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2004/act/1/section/17/enacted/en/html)
says that the Minister for Justice can make an order requiring that citizens
of certain countries need a visa to enter Ireland. Using their power under
this Section, the Minister signed [ SI 473 of 2014
](https://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2014/si/473/made/en/print) (Immigration
Act 2004 (Visas) Order 2014) setting out the countries whose citizens need a
visa.

The Minister can sign an SI into law without needing to pass a Bill through
the Houses of the Oireacthas. But the SI cannot exceed the powers that are
granted by the governing Act of the Oireachtas. The courts may strike down a
law because the Minister has acted _ultra vires_ (beyond their legal
authority).
