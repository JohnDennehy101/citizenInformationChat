##  What are the interest rates?

The Local Authority Purchase and Renovation Loan is made up of 2 parts, a
mortgage and a bridging loan. The mortgage and the bridging loan have
different terms and interest rates.

**1\. Interest rates for the mortgage part of the loan are fixed at:**

  * 4.00% for loans up to 25 years (APR 4.07%) 
  * 4.05% for loans over 25 years and up to 30 years (APR 4.13%) 

**Note:** The interest rates for the Local Authority Purchase and Renovation
Loan can change from time to time. You will get the interest rate that is
available when you drawdown your loan and this rate is set for the term of
your loan.

A fixed interest rate means that your monthly repayments remain the same for
the term of the loan. You can pay off all or part of your mortgage, but you
may have to pay a breakage fee.

You must sign up to the local authority collective Mortgage Protection
Insurance (MPI) scheme. You pay MPI monthly in addition to your loan
repayments.

**2\. Interest rates for the bridging loan are:**

  * 3.5% interest only variable rate for 2 years 

The bridging loan is an interest only loan. You can get your bridging loan for
the amount youâ€™ve been approved for with the Vacant Property Refurbishment
Grant. The bridging loan must be repaid once the grant is paid out.
