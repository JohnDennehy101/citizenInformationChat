##  Introduction

If you are in Ireland and are a victim of a crime or witness a crime, you
should contact the Garda Síochána (Irish police force). The [ emergency
services telephone number ](https://www.gov.ie/en/service/89da6-how-to-
contact-emergency-services-in-ireland/) is **999** or **112** .

If you are deaf, hard of hearing or speech-impaired, you can report a crime by
SMS text message on 112. You can find more about the [ emergency text service

If it would make you more comfortable, you can request to speak to a male or
female Garda.

If you do not speak English fluently, the Gardaí can provide free translation
services to you.

In less urgent situations, you should contact your [ local Garda station
](https://www.garda.ie/en/contact-us/station-directory/) to report a crime.

If you are unable to go to a Garda Station, you can ask that a Garda comes to
your home to take a report.

You can report non-emergency incidents of dangerous driving and other traffic-
related incidents using the [ Garda Traffic Watch Online Reporting form
](https://www.garda.ie/en/trafficwatchreport/) .
