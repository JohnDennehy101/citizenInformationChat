##  What if nobody is prosecuted?

Sometimes the Gardaí can decide to stop investigating a crime without
identifying a suspect – a person who they think committed the crime. If this
happens and you are a victim, you have a right to ask for a summary of the
reasons for this decision.

In other cases, the Gardaí or DPP can decide not to prosecute an identified
suspect. If you are a victim, you have a right to ask for a summary of the
reasons for this decision.

If you are a victim and you are notified of a decision not to prosecute, you
must send a request for a review of the decision within 56 days of being
notified.

If you are a victim and you get a summary of reasons for the decision, you
must ask for a review of the decision within 28 days of getting the summary.
