##  Dissolution of the Dáil

The Dáil can sit for a maximum of 5 years. This means that there must be a [
general election ](/en/government-in-ireland/elections-and-referenda/types-of-
elections-and-referendums/the-general-election/) at least every 5 years. There
is no minimum period for the duration of the Dáil.

The Taoiseach can ask the President to dissolve the Dáil at any time. The
President can only refuse to do this if the government does not have the
support of a majority in the Dáil.

A general election may also be called if:

  * The Taoiseach and government have lost a vote of no confidence in the Dáil. Under the [ Constitution of Ireland ](/en/government-in-ireland/irish-constitution-1/constitution-introduction/) , the Taoiseach and government must resign once a new government is formed. 
  * A coalition partner (a smaller party that joins a larger party to form a government) has withdrawn its support for the government. 

In both situations, opposition parties may be able to form a government and
elect a new Taoiseach without a general election taking place.

Once the Dáil has been dissolved, a general election must be held within 30
days.
