##  Introduction

Dáil Éireann is one of the Houses of the _Oireachtas_ , the national
parliament. The upper house of the Oireachtas is the [ Seanad
](/en/government-in-ireland/houses-of-the-oireachtas/the-seanad/) .

The elected members of Dáil Éireann are called TDs – _Teachta Dála_ (or
Deputies). TDs are elected directly to the Dáil in a [ general election
](/en/government-in-ireland/elections-and-referenda/types-of-elections-and-
referendums/the-general-election/) . If a vacancy occurs at the Dáil, the seat
will be filled by a [ bye-election ](/en/government-in-ireland/elections-and-
referenda/types-of-elections-and-referendums/by-elections-in-ireland/) .

The [ Constitution ](/en/government-in-ireland/irish-
constitution-1/constitution-introduction/) states that the number of TDs
cannot be more than one for every 20,000 of the population and cannot be less
than one for every 30,000.

There are currently 160 TDs.

Ireland is divided into 39 _constituencies_ and each constituency must elect
at least three members to the Dáil.

The Dáil is part of the legislative (or law making) branch of the Irish State.
Its members also elect the [ Taoiseach and Government ](/en/government-in-
ireland/how-government-works/national-government/government-of-ireland/)
following a general election.
