###  The work of a TD nationally

TDs are an important part of the [ law-making function ](/en/government-in-
ireland/houses-of-the-oireachtas/legislation/) of Dáil Éireann. They can
propose new legislation, even if they are not part of the government (in
_Private Member’s Bills_ ). They debate proposed legislation, examine drafts
and suggest amendments. Finally, they vote on the legislation, which, if it
passes, will then go to the Seanad to be debated and voted on.

TDs appoint the Taoiseach and the Government following a general election.

A TD might sit on a [ specialist committee
](https://www.oireachtas.ie/en/committees/32/procedure-dail/our-role/) , which
can advise the Dáil on a broad range of legislative, social, economic and
financial issues. A TD might also sit on a committee that looks at the
Government’s spending, or examines the work of a particular government
department (for example, the Joint Committee on Health). Committees also
examine draft legislation.
