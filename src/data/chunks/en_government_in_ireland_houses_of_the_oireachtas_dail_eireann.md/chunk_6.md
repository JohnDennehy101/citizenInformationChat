###  The work of a TD locally

TDs have both national and local roles. As your local representative, a TD can
ask questions in the Dáil or raise issues that are important to you or your
local area. Most TDs have constituency clinics, where you can meet them and
discuss issues that might then be raised in the Dáil or in PQs. [ A full list
of current TDs is published on Oireachtas.ie
