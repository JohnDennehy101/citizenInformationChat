##  Rules

In general people in employment insurable at PRSI Class A, D, J or M (Class M
only where the employee is under 16 years of age) are covered in full for
Occupational Injuries Benefits.

Civil servants recruited prior to April 1995 and insured at Class B may only
qualify for limited Occupational Injuries Benefits.

Education and Training Board trainees, people on employment schemes and people
over 66 who are working are covered for Occupational Injuries Benefits.

Unlike other social insurance benefits, it is not necessary to have a set
number of PRSI contributions to qualify. It is simply necessary to be in
employment that is insurable for Occupational Injuries.
