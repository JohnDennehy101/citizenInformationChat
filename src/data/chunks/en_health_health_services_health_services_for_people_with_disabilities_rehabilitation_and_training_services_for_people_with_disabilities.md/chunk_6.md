###  **Rehabilitative Training Bonus**

If you are a trainee in foundation training or in a sheltered workshop you
will continue to get any social welfare payments you are entitled to, such as
Disability Allowance.

If you started rehabilitative training before 1 September 2019, you will get a
training bonus of â‚¬31.80 a week until you finish your placement. You cannot
get the Rehabilitative Training Bonus if you started rehabilitative training
after 1 September 2019.

If you are in training for less than 5 days a week, this will be paid on a
pro-rata basis. For example, if you attend 2 days per week, you will get 2/5
of the allowance.
