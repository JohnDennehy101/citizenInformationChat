##  How to apply for rehabilitative training

You should contact Disability Services in your [ Local Health Office
](http://www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/1/LHO/) for more information on
rehabilitative training in your area. They will put you in touch with an
advisor from the HSE Occupational Guidance service.

If you are a school leaver it is important to plan in advance and contact the
HSE at least 13 months before you leave school.
