##  What is rehabilitative training?

The purpose of rehabilitative training is to give people with disabilities an
opportunity to train and learn important life skills such as decision-making,
planning, social and basic work skills.

Rehabilitative training can help you if you have an intellectual disability,
autism, mental health difficulty or complex physical disabilities. It aims to
improve your quality of life and promote independence and participation in the
community.

Rehabilitative training can also be a stepping stone to more mainstream
education or other training options such as the [ Vocational Training
Opportunities Scheme ](/en/education/further-education-and-
training/vocational-training-opportunities-scheme/) .

Rehabilitative training is not linked to employment.
