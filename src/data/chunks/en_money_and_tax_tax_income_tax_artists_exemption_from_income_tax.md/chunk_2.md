##  Introduction

Income earned by writers, composers, visual artists and sculptors from the
sale of their work is exempt from tax in Ireland in certain circumstances.

Artistic works can qualify if they are original and creative and are generally
recognised as having cultural or artistic merit. Earnings from these works are
exempt from income tax, starting from the year in which the claim is made.

There are [ guidelines on the artistic work that qualifies for tax exemption
(pdf) ](https://www.revenue.ie/en/personal-tax-credits-reliefs-and-
exemptions/documents/artist-exemption-guidelines.pdf) and is original and
creative with cultural or artistic merit. The guidelines also set out the
categories of work that are eligible for the scheme and the types of work that
are not eligible.

To apply for the Artistsâ€™ Exemption you must only be resident (or ordinarily
resident and domiciled) in:

  * One or more countries in the EU 
  * Iceland, Lichtenstein or Norway 
  * The United Kingdom
