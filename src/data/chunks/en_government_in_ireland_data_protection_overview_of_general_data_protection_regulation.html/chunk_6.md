###  Organisations must give you information

You must be given enough information in simple and clear language to know what
an organisation is going to do with your personal data. This is often found in
privacy policies on websites or in forms which you can read or sign in person.
For instance, you should be told:

  * The identity and contact details of the data controller or their EU representative 
  * The contact details for the organisation or company’s Data Protection Officer 
  * The reason for the intended processing and its legal basis 
  * What ‘legitimate interest’ the data controller has in your personal data if they are relying on a ‘legitimate interest’ to process the data 
  * Who will have access to your personal data 
  * Whether your personal data may be transferred outside the EU and if so, the data safeguards in that country 
  * How long your personal data will be stored or how that time period will be decided 
  * Whether you are required by law or a contract to provide your personal data and the consequences of not providing it 
  * If your personal data will be subject to any automated decision-making (decisions made by computer with no human input) or profiling processes 

The organisation should also [ tell you about your rights ](/en/government-in-
ireland/data-protection/rights-under-general-data-protection-regulation/) ,
including your right to:

  * Request [ access to your data ](/en/government-in-ireland/data-protection/rights-under-general-data-protection-regulation/)
  * Ask for your data to be corrected 
  * Ask for your data to be erased 
  * Ask for your data to be restricted 
  * Object to your data being processed 
  * Right to receive the data held in a form which allows it you to transfer it to another person 
  * Withdraw consent if consent is the basis for your personal data being processed 
  * Lodge a complaint 

In general, only personal data necessary for those stated purposes for which
it is collected should be collected and processed. Your personal data should
only be kept for as long as is necessary for the purpose for which it was
collected.

While it is being stored or processed, your personal data must be kept safe,
and policies and procedures must be in place to make sure that there is no
unauthorised access.
