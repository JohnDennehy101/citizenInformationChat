##  Introduction

If you are being [ dismissed from your job or made redundant
](/en/employment/unemployment-and-redundancy/losing-your-job/losing-your-job/)
you have certain entitlements including notice and pay for annual leave built
up but not taken.

This is a checklist of what your employer must give you when you leave work:

  * [ Pay that you are owed for work ](/en/employment/employment-rights-and-conditions/pay-and-employment/leaving-work-without-being-paid/) you have done 
  * [ A payslip ](/en/employment/employment-rights-and-conditions/pay-and-employment/pay-slip/) – showing your gross pay and any deductions 
  * Pay for annual leave which you have earned but not taken 
  * Pay instead of notice if you have not worked your notice period 
  * Information about what happens to your [ pension scheme ](/en/money-and-tax/personal-finance/pensions/occupational-pensions/) (if applicable) 

You no longer get a P45 when you lose your job. Now, when you leave a job your
employer will enter your leaving date and details of your final pay and
deductions into Revenue’s online system. You can view your pay details through
the ‘Manage your tax’ link in [ Revenue’s myAccount
](https://www.revenue.ie/en/online-services/services/manage-your-
record/manage-your-tax-for-the-current-year-paye-customers.aspx) .
