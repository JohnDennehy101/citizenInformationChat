##  How much notice should I get?

You may be entitled to notice if you are being let go from your job. This
means that you are given notice that your job will end, and a date when this
will come into effect. The length of notice you are entitled to, will depend
on your contract of employment. There is also a minimum entitlement set out in
the [ Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Acts 1973â€“2005
](http://revisedacts.lawreform.ie/eli/1973/act/4/revised/en/html) .

To be entitled to the legal (or 'statutory') minimum, you must have been
working for your employer continuously for at least 13 weeks.
