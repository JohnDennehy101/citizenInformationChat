###  Minimum period of notice

The amount of notice you are entitled to by law depends on how long you have
been working for your employer.

Duration of employment  |  Minimum notice   
---|---  
13 weeks to 2 years  |  1 week   
2 years to 5 years  |  2 weeks   
5 years to 10 years  |  4 weeks   
10 years to 15 years  |  6 weeks   
15 years or more  |  8 weeks   
  
For example, if you have worked for your employer for 5 years and 3 months you
get 4 weeks' notice.

While the notice entitlements under your contract of employment can be more
than the minimum periods above, your contract cannot have a notice period less
than the above.

This means that whatever your contract says, your employer must give you at
least the statutory minimum period of notice. You cannot get less, even if
your contract says this.
