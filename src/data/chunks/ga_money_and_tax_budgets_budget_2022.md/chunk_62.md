###  Zoned Land Tax

A new **Zoned Land Tax** of 3% tax is being introduced to encourage the use of
land that is zoned residential and mixed-use to build homes. The tax will
apply to land which is zoned suitable for residential development and is
serviced, but has not been developed for housing. A lead-in time for the
general application of the Zoned Land Tax of 2 years is proposed for land
zoned before January 2022, and a 3 year lead-in time for land zoned after
January 2022. The Zoned Land Tax will replace the **vacant sites levy** when
it comes into operation.
