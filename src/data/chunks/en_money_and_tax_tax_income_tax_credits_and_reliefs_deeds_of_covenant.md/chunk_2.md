##  What is a deed of covenant?

A deed of covenant is a written legal agreement for one person to pay another
an amount without getting any benefit in return.

The person who

  * Makes the payment is called a _covenantor_
  * Gets the payment is called a _covenantee_

You can agree to pay any amount of money under the deed. However, only certain
covenants qualify for tax relief.
