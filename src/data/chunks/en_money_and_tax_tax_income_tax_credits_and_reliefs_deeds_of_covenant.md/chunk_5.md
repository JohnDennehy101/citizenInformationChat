##  How to make a payment under a deed of covenant

You must make the deed before you make any payments. You should make sure that
you are able to make all payments before the deed ends.

Payments must be paid on the dates that are set out in the deed and for the
amount specified. You cannot change the amount or frequency of payments during
the period of the deed.

If you are the covenantor, you must complete [ Form R185 - Certificate of
Income Tax Deducted ](https://www.revenue.ie/en/self-assessment-and-self-
employment/documents/form-r185.pdf) and deduct tax at the standard rate each
time you make a payment.
