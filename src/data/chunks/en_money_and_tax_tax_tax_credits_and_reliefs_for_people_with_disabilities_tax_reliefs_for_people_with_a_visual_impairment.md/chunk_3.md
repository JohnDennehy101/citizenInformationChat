##  Blind Person’s Tax Credit

The [ Blind Person’s Tax Credit ](https://revenue.ie/en/personal-tax-credits-
reliefs-and-exemptions/health-and-age/blind-tax-credit/index.aspx) is €1,650.
For a married couple or civil partners, where both are blind, the credit is
€3,300.

Parents cannot claim a Blind Person’s Tax Credit in respect of any children
who are blind, but you can claim the [ Incapacitated Child Tax Credit
](/en/money-and-tax/tax/tax-credits-and-reliefs-for-people-with-
disabilities/incapacitated-child-tax-credit/) .

To apply for the Blind Person's Tax Credit, you must have a certificate from
an ophthalmic surgeon (a doctor who performs eye surgery). The certificate
must state that either:

  * Your best vision is not better than 6/60 vision in the better eye with glasses or contact lenses or 
  * Your field of vision is limited to within an angle of 20 degrees or less 

The certificate should state whether the visual impairment is permanent or
temporary. If it is temporary, you will need a certificate for each year you
claim the credit. If it is permanent, you continue to get the tax credit
indefinitely.
