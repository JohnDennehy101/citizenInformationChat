##  Introduction

Self-employed people can become unemployed if their business has to close
down. It may also be the case, though you continue to be self-employed the
amount of work you are getting has reduced so much that it no longer provides
you with a sufficient income.

If you find yourself unemployed or you are getting less work than before you
may qualify for a jobseeker's payment. You do **not** need to de-register as
self-employed to get a payment. However you must meet [ the conditions that
apply to jobseeker's payments ](/en/social-welfare/unemployed-people/rules-
for-getting-a-jobseekers-payment/) .

If you do not qualify for a social welfare payment you may be eligible to pay
[ voluntary contributions ](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-
system/social-insurance-prsi/voluntary-prsi-contributions/) .
