###  Consular Assistance

[ Irish embassies and consulates ](https://www.ireland.ie/en/dfa/embassies/)
ensure that the rights of Irish citizens who are arrested or imprisoned abroad
are fully respected. In many cases the local authorities will only contact the
Irish embassy or consulate if requested to do so. Among other things, a
consular officer can:

  * Help with getting information about prison arrangements 
  * Provide information about local lawyers 
  * Provide families with information about the prison and legal arrangements in the country where their family member is detained 
  * Help prisoners to maintain contact with friends and family and arrange for the safe transfer of funds they provide 
  * Put the detained person in touch with relevant agencies such as ICPO
