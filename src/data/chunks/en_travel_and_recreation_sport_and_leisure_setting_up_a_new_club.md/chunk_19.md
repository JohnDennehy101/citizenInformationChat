##  Working with children and young people

If your club works with children, you should develop specific policies and
procedures on how to create a safe environment to prevent deliberate harm or
abuse to the children using your services. These policies and procedures
should cover:

  * Dealing with child protection concerns 
  * Reporting child protection concerns 
  * Working safely with children 
  * Recruiting and managing staff 
  * Child safeguarding awareness and training 
  * Involving parents and children 
  * Implementing and reviewing the safeguarding strategies
