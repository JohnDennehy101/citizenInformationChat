##  Getting started

If you are setting up a club, such as a sports club, there are a few questions
you should consider:

  * Are there enough potential members? 
  * Are there enough volunteers to run the club? 
  * Is there another club in the area that is already meeting the need for this type of club? 

If there is a national governing body (NGB) for the sport or activity you
should contact it for advice.

Once you have decided to set up a club there are a number of things you will
need to agree on.
