####  Collecting and processing personal data

When you set up a new club, you will start collecting or using personal data,
for example, to manage your club’s membership. You will need to get people’s
consent to do this. Consent must be requested whether you are using paper
membership forms, membership databases or other systems. When asking for
consent to process people’s data, for example, on membership forms or for
Gardaí vetting, you must tell them:

  * The club’s identity and contact details 
  * The reasons for collecting the data 
  * The uses it will be put to 
  * Who their data will be disclosed to (and if it will be transferred outside the EU) 
  * The [ legal basis ](http://gdprandyou.ie/gdpr-12-steps/#what-we-mean-when-we-talk-about-a-legal-basis) for processing the data 
  * How long the data will be kept 
  * That they can complain if they are unhappy with how the club is complying with data protection regulations 
  * If their data will be subject to automated decision making 
  * Their rights under GDPR, for example, in relation to accessing, rectifying and erasing data, see below. 

You must provide this information in easy to understand, clear language. You
must also be able to demonstrate that consent was given (pre-ticked boxes or
inactivity cannot be taken as consent).
