####  Reporting data breaches

Personal data must be kept securely (encrypted if using technology) and should
only be retained for as long as it is needed for the original purpose it was
collected. If your security is breached and peopleâ€™s personal data is
destroyed, lost, altered or accessed by an unauthorised person or
organisation, you must report this to the [ Data Protection Commission (DPC)
](https://dataprotection.ie/docs/Home/4.htm) .

You must report a data breach within 72 hours of becoming aware of it. Data
breaches that can harm an individual, for example, identity theft, must also
be reported to the person concerned.

Your club can be inspected and could face significant penalties if you are in
breach of GDPR.
