###  Committee meetings

The club committee is the group of members who are formally responsible for
managing the club. Establishing a committee with clearly identified roles can
help to identify who does what in the club and can help to spread the
workload. The committee should meet several times a year. Information on a
code of practice for good governance of community, voluntary and charitable
organisation's is available at the [ Charities Regulator website
](https://www.charitiesregulator.ie/en/information-for-charities/charities-
governance-code) .
