##  Finance

You will have to raise funds to run the club. Initially, these funds may come
from membership subscriptions. You should also outline the costs of running
the club for the year. This will help you create a budget of income and
expenditure for the next 12 months.

You will need a bank account in the name of the club. The bank will usually
ask for two signatories for withdrawing cash or signing cheques.

The Treasurer must maintain either:

  * A bound account book for recording details of the financial affairs of the club or 
  * A computer programme from which printouts can be made in the format of an account book. Appropriate backup arrangements should be made to avoid irretrievable loss of data. 

All monies and cheques received should be paid into the club bank account and
recorded in the account book. Receipts should be issued for any cash received.
The accounts may have to be audited each year.

There is a scheme of tax relief on income for certain eligible charities and
other approved bodies, including sporting bodies. Information on tax relief
for sporting bodies and charities is available in the [ charities and sports
bodies section of revenue.ie. ](https://www.revenue.ie/en/companies-and-
