###  PRSI and tax

When you lose your job you should register as unemployed with your [ local
Intreo centre or Social Welfare Branch Office
](http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/List-of-Social-Welfare-Local-and-Branch-
Offices-by-County.aspx) even if you do not qualify for an unemployment
payment. You may be able to sign on for [ credited PRSI contributions
](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/social-insurance-
prsi/credited-social-insurance-contributions/) so that you do not have a break
in your social insurance record.

You may be entitled to a [ tax refund ](/en/money-and-tax/tax/income-tax/tax-
refund-when-unemployed-or-out-of-work-sick/) if you have been out of work for
some time.

You will no longer receive a P45 when you lose your job. Your employer will
notify Revenue of your leaving date and details of your final pay and
deductions through Revenue’s online system. You can view these details through
[ Revenue’s myAccount ](https://www.ros.ie/myaccount-
web/sign_in.html?execution=e1s1) .
