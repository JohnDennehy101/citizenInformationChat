##  What happens if my passport is lost or stolen?

If your passport is lost or stolen, **the passport is no longer valid for
travel** and the details are reported to Interpol.

If you find your passport after reporting it as lost or stolen, do not travel
on it.

You should report it to the Garda√≠ to protect yourself from identity fraud.

Losing the passport may reduce the length of time that your next passport is
valid. If you have lost 2 or more passports, you may not get a full 10-year
passport. It will depend on how many passports you have lost or had stolen. It
may take longer to process the application for your next passport.

Your passport may need to be valid for a certain amount of time before you can
enter a country. Contact your air carrier or travel agent or the [ embassy or
consulate of the country you are travelling to
](https://www.ireland.ie/en/dfa/embassies/) . You should do this in good time
before you travel as it may affect your plans.
