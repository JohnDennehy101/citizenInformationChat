##  Losing your Irish passport abroad

Losing your passport or having it stolen while abroad can be very stressful.
But there are 2 things you must immediately do.

**1.Make a police report**

Contact the local police and request a written statement that you have
reported the loss of your passport. The Passport Service will only provide you
with a new travel document with a police report.

**2.Contact your Irish embassy or consulate**

You should contact your [ nearest Irish embassy or consulate
](https://www.ireland.ie/en/dfa/embassies/) .

They may be able to give you:

  * A replacement passport that will let you finish your trip 
  * An emergency travel document that will get you home 

If you are currently in a country without Irish representation, you may
contact an embassy or consulate of another EU member state. Sometimes, the
embassy or consulate of another EU Member State may issue you with an [ EU
Emergency Travel Document (ETD)
