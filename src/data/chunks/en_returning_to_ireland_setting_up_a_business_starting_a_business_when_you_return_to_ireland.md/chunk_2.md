##  Introduction

If you are returning to Ireland after living abroad, you may decide to work
for yourself, rather than for an employer. Your knowledge and skills gained
from life abroad can help you to succeed in the local economy.

This page has information on how to become a business-owner in Ireland,
including guidance on how to write a business plan, hire staff, and manage
your taxes.

If a non-Irish citizen is coming to Ireland to set up a business with you,
they may need to apply for permission first. Read about [ coming to set up a
business in Ireland as a non-EEA, UK or Swiss national
