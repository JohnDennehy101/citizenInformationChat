###  Children Plus Initiative

From 2013 on, €14 million per year will be allocated from the Department of
Social Protection to the Department of Children, Equality, Disability,
Integration and Youth to fund a joint initiative that will provide over 6,000
after-school childcare places for children in primary school. This will be
targeted at children from low-income families whose parents are availing of an
employment opportunity (who engage with the Department of Social Protection’s
INTREO service). It is envisaged that interested childcare providers, both
community and commercial, will be paid a subsidy where a parent is referred by
the Department of Social Protection under the initiative. The initiative will
commence with a pilot scheme in early 2013.

An additional €2 million will be allocated to the School Meals Programme.

€2.5 million in funding will be allocated to the Department of Children and
Youth Affairs for its Area-Based Child Poverty Initiative. This initiative
will be co-funded by the Department of Children, Equality, Disability,
Integration and Youth and philanthropic partners.
