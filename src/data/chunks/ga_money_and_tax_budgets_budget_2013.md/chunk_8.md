###  Local Property Tax (LPT)

The Local Property Tax (LPT) will come into force on 1 July 2013. A half year
payment will be due for the second half of 2013, with a full year payment due
in 2014.

The property owner will be liable for the LPT. This includes local authorities
and social housing organisations.

Where the property is valued at €1 million or lower, the tax will be based on
the mid-point of the relevant band at a rate of 0.18%. For properties valued
over €1 million the tax will be charged at 0.18% on the first €1 million of
value and 0.25% on any balance in excess of €1 million, with no banding
applied.

Payment can be made by credit or debit card, cash, direct debit or by
voluntary deduction at source from Irish salary or wages, occupational
pensions or certain payments from the Department of Social Protection and the
Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.

If the LPT is not paid, a charge will attach to the property which must be
paid if the property is sold or the ownership transferred.

The Revenue Commissioners will send out an explanatory booklet on the
operation of LPT, including valuation procedures, in March 2013.

Valuation will be by self-assessment in 2013 and those valuations will be used
until the end of 2016.
