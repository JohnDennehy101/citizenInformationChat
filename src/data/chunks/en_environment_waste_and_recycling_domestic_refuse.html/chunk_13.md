##  How much does bin collection cost?

There are no flat rate fees for household waste collections.

Your bin company will either calculate the cost of collecting your rubbish by
its weight or charge you for each bin collection (this is called a ’per lift
charge’). Some contracts may have a combination of the two.

Bin collection fees and [ charging structures
](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/a467a-waste-collection-charges/) will be
different depending on which private bin company you choose.

You should shop around for a service that best suits your needs.
