##  VAT on imports

This section only deals with VAT for consumers who buy goods for personal use.

In general, you have to pay VAT and import duty on any goods you are bringing
into Ireland from outside the European Union (EU). This includes goods
purchased online and by mail order. You will have to pay VAT at the same rate
as applies in Ireland for similar goods.

Within the EU, VAT is usually paid in the member state you purchased the
goods, however, there are some exceptions - see below.
