###  If you buy online

**From outside the EU**

From 1 July 2021, the VAT exemption on goods up to a value of €22 from outside
the EU no longer applies. All goods arriving into Ireland from non-EU
countries are subject to VAT.

Some online retailers are registered with the [ Import One Stop Shop (IOSS)
](https://www.revenue.ie/en/vat/vat-ecommerce/import-oss/index.aspx) so that
VAT can be included in the price you pay for the goods. Before you make a
purchase, check whether the advertised price includes tax and duty costs.

Customs duty is charged on goods with a value over €150.

Excise Duty is payable on alcohol and tobacco products and is separate from
Customs Duty.

Revenue has a guide to [ buying goods from outside the EU for personal use
](https://www.revenue.ie/en/customs/individuals/buying-online-
personal/outside-eu.aspx) including information on how to calculate what you
owe in duties and taxes.

**From another EU Member State**

If you buy goods online or by mail from another EU member state you may pay
VAT at the rate that applies in Ireland. However, if the supplier that you are
buying the goods from has not exceeded the [ Distance Sales Threshold
](http://www.revenue.ie/en/vat/goods-and-services-to-and-from-abroad/distance-
sales/index.aspx) in Ireland then you will pay VAT at the rate that would
apply in the country of purchase. You will usually be told the amount of VAT
payable at checkout.

Excisable products (for example, alcohol, tobacco and oil) purchased within
the EU via the internet or by mail are subject to [ excise duty ](/en/money-
and-tax/tax/duties-and-vat/excise-duties/) and VAT.
