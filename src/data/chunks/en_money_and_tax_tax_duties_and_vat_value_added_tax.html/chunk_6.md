###  Travelling with your purchases

**From outside the EU**

You can buy and bring your goods (other than tobacco and alcohol products)
from a non-EU State into Ireland without paying any taxes, if their value is
no more than:

  * €430 if you are aged over 15 
  * €215 if you are aged under 15 

You will have to pay VAT and customs duty on anything over these amounts.

If you bring in an item worth more than the €430 or €215 limit, you must pay
import charges on the full value. Revenue has [ information on duties and
taxes if you are arriving in Ireland from outside the EU

free/from-outside-eu/index.aspx) .

**From another EU Member State**

There are no limits on what you can buy and take with you when you travel
between EU countries, as long as the products you bought are for your own
personal use and not for resale.

VAT is included in the price of the product in the EU member state and no
further payment of taxes including VAT can be charged here in Ireland. The
exception to this is where you are [ importing a vehicle ](/en/moving-
country/moving-to-ireland/coming-to-live-in-ireland/importing-car-into-
ireland/) from the EU.

Special rules apply in the case of goods subject to excise duty, such as
alcohol and tobacco products. Revenue has [ information on duties and taxes if
