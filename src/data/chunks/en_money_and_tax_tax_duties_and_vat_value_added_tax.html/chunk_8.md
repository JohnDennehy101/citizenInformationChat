##  VAT on residential property

If you:

  * Buy a new house from a builder or developer, you will be charged VAT at 13.5% 
  * Buy or sell an ‘old’ or existing property, you do not have to pay VAT 
  * Buy a site for a house from a landowner, you do not have to pay VAT unless you have an agreement with both the landowner and a builder to develop the site   

If a new property is resold within 5 years of its completion, it is taxable
for VAT if it has not been lived in for at least 2 years. Revenue has [
detailed information about when a property is taxable for VAT (pdf)
](https://www.revenue.ie/en/tax-professionals/tdm/value-added-
tax/part11-immovable-goods/supply-of-property/supply-of-property.pdf) .

If you are a landlord, you cannot charge VAT on rent from residential
property.

If you paid VAT on your house (because you bought it from a developer or
builder) you only have to pay [ stamp duty ](/en/housing/owning-a-home/buying-
a-home/stamp-duty/) on the base price of the house – before the VAT was added.
So, for example, if you paid €227,000 (including VAT) for your new house, this
is made up of the base price of €200,000 plus 13.5% VAT (€27,000) and you only
pay stamp duty on the base price of €200,000.
