##  Protection of your employment rights

In general, you will be treated as if you are in work during leave for medical
care. This means:

  * You are entitled to return to work in the job you held immediately before you started the leave 
  * You donâ€™t count your time on leave as breaking your continuous service 
  * You must not be dismissed for taking or asking to take the leave 
  * You must not be [ victimised ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/employment/enforcement_and_redress/victimisation_at_work.en.html) for taking or asking to take leave for medical care. Your employer cannot penalise or treat you unfairly by, for example, giving you worse conditions of employment or selecting you for redundancy.
