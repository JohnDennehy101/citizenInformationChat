##  What serious medical care is covered?

The sick person must need significant care or support for a _serious medical
reason_ .

Serious medical reason is not defined in the Act.

Your employer can request relevant evidence of the medical need for the leave.

Relevant evidence is either:

  * A medical certificate signed by a doctor 
  * Other evidence the employer may reasonably require 

The medical cert does not need to state the nature of the medical condition.
It only needs to be a statement of fact that the person is, or was, in need of
significant care or support for a serious medical reason.
