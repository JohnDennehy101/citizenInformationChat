##  How to apply

You must give confirmation to your employer in writing that you want to apply
for (or have already taken) the leave. You should do this as soon as
reasonably practical. You must also sign this confirmation.

Your signed confirmation must contain:

  * The start date 
  * Length of the leave 
  * A statement of fact (explaining why you are entitled to the leave). 

Your employer must keep the confirmation document and give you a written
acknowledgment that they received the confirmation.
