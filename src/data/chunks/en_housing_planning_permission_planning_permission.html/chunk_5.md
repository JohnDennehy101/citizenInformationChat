###  Types of planning permission

There are 2 types of planning permission:

  * Permission 
  * Outline permission 

The most common type of planning permission is **permission** , which is
sometimes called full permission. This is where the local authority agrees to
your work. Permission is normally subject to conditions, some of which may
require changes to your proposals. Planning permission normally lasts for 5
years.

**Outline permission** is where you apply to see if the local authority agrees
in principle with you building a house or large extension. When applying for
outline permission, you only need certain plans and details about your
proposal. You need to produce enough for the planning authority to make a
decision about the siting, layout or other proposals for development.
Generally, outline permission last for 3 years. If you get outline permission,
you will then have to submit detailed drawings and get consequent permission
before you start building work.

**You must not start building before you get planning permission.**
