##  What happens after I submit my application?

Anyone can make a written submission or observation objecting to or supporting
your planning application. It costs â‚¬20 to make a submission. Generally, the
local planning authority must make a decision on a planning application within
8 weeks of receiving the application, but if the local authority needs more
information, or the decision is appealed, it may take much longer. The
decision will be notified in writing to you and anyone who commented on your
application.
