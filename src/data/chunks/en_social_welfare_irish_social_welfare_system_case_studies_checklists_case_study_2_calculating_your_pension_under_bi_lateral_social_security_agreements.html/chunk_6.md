####  **Step 2**

Second, you must calculate Mary’s 'notional rate of pension'. This is the rate
of State Pension Mary would be entitled to if all her contributions were
assessed as Irish contributions.

You can calculate this by dividing the total number of contributions, both
Irish and foreign (1,800), by the total number of years worked since entering
insurable employment (34).

**Yearly average number of contributions calculation** Total assessable contributions  |  600 Irish contributions + 1,200 US contributions = 1,800   
---|---  
Total number of years worked*  |  34   
Yearly average number of contributions  |  1,800 ÷ 34 = **52.9**  
  
*since entering insurable employment to the end of the last complete tax year before reaching pension age 

Mary’s yearly average number of contributions is 52.9. You need a yearly
average of 48 contributions to get the maximum State Pension (Contributory).

As Mary has more than enough contributions, her notional rate of pension is
the same as the maximum rate of State Pension (Contributory), which is €277.30
(in 2024).

**Step 3**

Third, you calculate what pension Mary would get under bilateral security
agreements. You do this by applying the following formula:

  * (A x B) ÷ C = rate of State Pension 

**Figures for pension calculation** A = Notional rate of pension (calculated in step 2)  |  €277.30   
---|---  
B = Number of Irish contributions  |  600   
C = Total number of contributions (Irish and foreign)  |  1,800   
  
First, you multiply the notional rate of pension (A) by the total number of
Irish contributions (B):

  * €277.30 x 600 = €166,380 

Then, you divide €166,380 by the total number of Irish and foreign
contributions (C):

  * €166,380 ÷ 1,800 = €92.43 

Mary’s rate of State Pension (Contributory), calculated under bilateral
security agreements, is €92.43.

**In this case Mary would be better off claiming a State Pension based on her
Irish contributions alone rather than one calculated under bilateral social
security agreements.**
