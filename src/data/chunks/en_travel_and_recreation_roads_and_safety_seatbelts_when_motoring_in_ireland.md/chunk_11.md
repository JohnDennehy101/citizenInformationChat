##  Pre-1992 registered vehicles

All cars first registered in Ireland since 1 June 1971 must have seat belts
fitted on front seats. All cars first registered since 1992 must have seat
belts fitted on rear seats. In a pre-1992 registered car without fitted seat
belts, passengers are exempted from the law requiring them to use a safety
belt (or child restraint) when travelling in the back of the car. However, it
is strongly recommended you have seat belts or child restraints fitted.
