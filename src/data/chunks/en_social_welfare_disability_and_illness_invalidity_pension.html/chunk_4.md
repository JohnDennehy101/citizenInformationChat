###  Social insurance (PRSI) rules

Only PRSI contributions at Class A, E, H and S count for an Invalidity
Pension. Most employees are covered by Class A.

You must also have a certain number of PRSI contributions to get an Invalidity
Pension.

To get Invalidity Pension you must have at least:

  * 260 (5 years) paid PRSI contributions 
  * 48 weeks of paid or credited PRSI contributions in the last or second last completed year before the **start date of your permanent incapacity for work.** The start date is decided by the Department of Social Protection (DSP). It is usually after you have been unable to work for one year. But it can be less than one year if you are permanently incapable of work for life. 

If you need your social insurance contributions paid in another EU/EEA member
state to help you qualify, then your last contribution must have been in
Ireland. Read more about [ combining social insurance contributions from
abroad ](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/claiming-a-social-
welfare-payment/social-insurance-contributions-from-abroad/) .

You cannot use voluntary contributions to meet the PRSI rules.
