###  Medical rules

To get Invalidity Pension you must meet the PRSI rules and be unable to work
because of an illness or disability.

To meet the medical rules, you must:

  * Have been incapable of work for at least 12 months and be likely to be incapable of work for at least another 12 months (you may have been getting Illness Benefit or Disability Allowance during that time) 

**Or**

  * Be permanently incapable of work (in certain cases of very serious illness or disability, you can transfer directly from another social welfare payment or from your job to Invalidity Pension). 

A Deciding Officer in the DSP will decide if you meet the medical and PRSI
rules for Invalidity Pension.
