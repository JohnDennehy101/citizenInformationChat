##  Defence

When a respondent receives a claim notice they must choose whether or not to
defend the case.

If you are the respondent and you wish to admit that you were wrong and
prevent the case from going to court, you must contact the claimant or the
claimant’s solicitor within 10 days of receiving the claim notice to agree
payment of the claim and any costs.

If you believe that the claimant is not entitled to the damages being sought
and you wish to defend the case in court, you must:

  * Serve an appearance and defence on the claimant or the claimant’s solicitor and 
  * File a copy of the appearance with the District Court clerk
