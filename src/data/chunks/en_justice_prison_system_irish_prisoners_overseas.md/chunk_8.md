###  Irish Council for Prisoners Overseas

The [ Irish Council for Prisoners Overseas (ICPO) ](http://www.icpo.ie/) is a
charitable organisation that works to provide information and support to Irish
people imprisoned overseas and their families.

ICPO services include:

  * Providing information and support to prisoners and their families on a wide range of issues, including repatriation, deportation, health, legal matters, discrimination and ill-treatment 
  * Representing prisonersâ€™ interests to relevant parties (Irish embassies and consulates, welfare agencies, probation and legal officers) 
  * Monitoring repatriation applications with the Department of Justice 
  * Providing help to prisoners in preparation for their release 
  * Visiting prisoners and helping families with travel and accommodation for prison visits 

The ICPO holds a Family Information Day each year to provide families with
information and support and to give them the opportunity to meet other people
who have a relative in prison overseas.
