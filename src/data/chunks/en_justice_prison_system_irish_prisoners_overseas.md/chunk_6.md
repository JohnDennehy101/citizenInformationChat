###  Entitlement to social welfare

To be entitled to certain social welfare payments, a returning ex-prisoner
must satisfy the [ habitual residence condition ](/en/social-welfare/irish-
social-welfare-system/social-assistance-payments/habitual-residence-
condition/) . This means that they must have a close link to Ireland.

However, people who have been deported generally do not have to satisfy the
habitual residence condition.
