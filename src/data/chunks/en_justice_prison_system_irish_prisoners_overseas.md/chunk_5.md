###  Deportation

Upon completion of their sentence, an Irish national may automatically be
returned to Ireland by the authorities of the country in which they were
imprisoned. This is referred to as deportation.

Some countries automatically deport an overseas prisoner if they have served a
certain amount of time in prison or if they have any previous convictions.

If deported, it is important that a prisoner keeps whatever documentation they
are given about their imprisonment and subsequent deportation. This material
may be helpful in obtaining benefits in Ireland.

Irish prisoners are, with limited exceptions, [ exempt from compulsory
deportation ](https://www.icpo.ie/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Deportation-

their sentence.
