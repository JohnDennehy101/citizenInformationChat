###  Repatriation

Ireland is a signatory to the [ Council of Europe Convention on the Transfer
of Sentenced Persons
](http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Treaties/Html/112.htm) . This is a
legal agreement that allows prisoners to apply to be transferred home to serve
their prison sentence in their own country.

For a transfer to take place, there must be agreement among:

  * The prisoner 
  * The sentencing country; and 
  * The prisonerâ€™s home country 

The following 4 conditions must also be met for a prisoner to be eligible to
apply for a transfer:

  1. The prisoner must be regarded as a national of the country they wish to be transferred to. 
  2. The sentence must be final. A prisoner cannot apply for transfer before they face trial or until after all appeals have been heard. 
  3. There must be at least 6 months left to serve on the sentence. 
  4. The crime that the prisoner is convicted of must also be a crime in their home country. 

An application for a transfer usually begins with the prisoner informing the
prison authorities that they wish to be transferred back to Ireland to serve
their sentence.

Alternatively, the prisoner [ can communicate this wish directly to the
Minister for Justice ](https://www.gov.ie/en/organisation/department-of-
justice/) . However, it is likely that this will add a number of weeks to the
process.
