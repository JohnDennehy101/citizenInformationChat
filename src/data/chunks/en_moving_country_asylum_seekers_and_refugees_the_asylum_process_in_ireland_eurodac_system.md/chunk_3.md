##  What information is stored by Eurodac?

In addition to fingerprints, data sent by member states include the member
state of origin (the state sending the data), the place and date of the
international protection application (if applicable), the personâ€™s gender and
a reference number. Data is collected for anyone over 14 years of age and is
encoded directly into the database, either by the Central Unit or by the
member state of origin.

In the case of asylum seekers, data is kept for 10 years unless the individual
obtains the citizenship of one of the member states, when their particulars
are immediately erased. Data relating to foreign nationals apprehended when
attempting to cross an external border irregularly is kept for 2 years from
the date on which the fingerprints were taken. Data is immediately erased
before the end of 2 years if the foreign national either:

  * Receives a residence permit or 
  * Has left the territory of the member states 

In the case of foreign nationals found illegally present within a member
state, Eurodac makes it possible to check their fingerprints against those in
the central database to determine whether the individual had previously lodged
an international protection application in another member state. After the
fingerprints have been transmitted for comparison purposes, they are not
stored by Eurodac.
