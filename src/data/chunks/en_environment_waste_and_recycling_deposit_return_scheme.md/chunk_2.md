##  What is the Deposit Return Scheme?

When you buy a drink in a container with the [ Re-turn logo ](https://re-
turn.ie) , you are charged a small refundable deposit. You can then claim back
the levy by returning the empty container.

This bottle and can recycling system is known as the Deposit Return Scheme.
The scheme began on 1 February 2024.

The cost of the deposit is automatically added to the cost of the drink.

You can get your deposit by returning your containers as long as they are
empty and undamaged.
