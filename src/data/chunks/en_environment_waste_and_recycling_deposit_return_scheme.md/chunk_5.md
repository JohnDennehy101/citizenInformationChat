###  **Should I leave the bottle cap on when returning my bottle?**

You should leave the bottle cap on your bottle when you return it. This will
ensure that:

  * The bottle cap is properly recycled 
  * The bottle holds its shape, making it easier for the machine to read the barcode 

Since 3 July 2024, all plastic drink containers of up to 3 litre in size must
have their caps attached to them. This helps make sure that bottle caps are
properly recycled with bottles. This rule was introduced as part of the [ EUâ€™s
Directive on single-use plastics ](https://eur-
lex.europa.eu/eli/dir/2019/904/oj) . The European Commission has more
information on their [ plans to tackle single-use plastics
](https://environment.ec.europa.eu/topics/plastics/single-use-plastics_en) .
