##  Where can I return my containers?

You can return your containers to shops that sell drink containers with the
Re-turn logo. You don't need to return your containers to the same shop that
you bought them from.

At the shops you can either return the containers:

  * Using a Reverse Vending Machine (RVM) 
  * Manually in the shop 

Not all shops have a Reverse Vending Machine.

If a shop does not have a RVM but they sell containers with the Re-turn logo,
the shop may allow you to manually return containers in store, unless they
have a take back exemption, see below.

[ Re-turn.ie ](https://re-turn.ie/) has an interactive map, which shows you
all the locations where you can return your containers. You can also search by
entering an address or Eircode.

Find the [ map and other information about where to return your containers on
the Re-turn website ](https://re-turn.ie/#WhereToReturn) .
