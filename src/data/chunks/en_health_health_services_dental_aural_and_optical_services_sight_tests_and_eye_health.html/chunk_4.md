##  Eye tests covered by the Treatment Benefit Scheme

If you do not qualify for free optical services from the HSE, the [ Treatment
Benefit Scheme ](/en/social-welfare/disability-and-illness/treatment-benefit-
scheme/) may cover you and your dependent spouse or partner for certain free
optical services.

The scheme is based on your social insurance [ (PRSI) contributions
](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/social-insurance-prsi/paying-
social-insurance/) . If you do not have enough PRSI contributions, you may
have to pay for the eye tests.

This scheme is run by the Department of Social Protection (DSP) and is also
called the Optical Benefit Scheme. The DSP has a [ list of available opticians
under the Treatment Benefits Scheme.
