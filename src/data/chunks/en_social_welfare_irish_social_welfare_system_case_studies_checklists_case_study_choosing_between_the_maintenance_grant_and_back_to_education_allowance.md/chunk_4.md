###  Peter has been getting a One-Parent Family Payment for 3 years and is
starting a full-time course in higher education at third level:

Peter is getting a One-Parent Family Payment which means he has two options
and will need to work out which will give him the higher income.

  1. Peter can stay on his One-Parent Family Payment and get a student grant (both maintenance and fee components). If he chooses this option he will continue to get his One-Parent Family Payment at his current rate as well as the grant. However, he will lose any secondary benefits such as Rent Supplement. If he is getting a Housing Assistance Payment (HAP), he must notify the local authority and the maintenance component of his grant may be assessed as income. 

If he is nearing the end of his entitlement to One-Parent Family Payment, the
Back to Education Allowance may be of greater benefit to him because it is
paid for the duration of his course.

  1. Peter can transfer from One-Parent Family Payment (OFP) to the Back to Education Allowance (BTEA). If he chooses this option, he will not get the maintenance component of the student grant. His rate of payment on BTEA will be the same as the rate of One-Parent Family Payment he was getting and he can keep any secondary benefits he is currently getting. 

He must still apply to SUSI to be assessed for the fee component of the
student grant, covering the student contribution and any tuition
fees/essential field trip costs.
