###  Maria has been getting a Disability Allowance for a number of years and
is starting a full-time course in higher education at third level:

Maria is getting a Disability Allowance which means she has two options and
will need to work out which will give her the higher income.

  1. Maria can stay on Disability Allowance and get a student grant (both maintenance and fee components). If she chooses this option she will continue to get Disability Allowance at her current rate. However, she will lose any secondary benefits she is already getting such as Rent Supplement. If she is getting a Housing Assistance Payment (HAP), she must notify the local authority and the maintenance component of her grant may be assessed as income. 

If she is living at home, her parentsâ€™ income may affect the amount of
maintenance grant she will get. It may mean she will get a reduced amount of
maintenance grant, or just the fee component of the student grant, or neither.
She must notify the Disability Allowance Section in the Department of Social
Protection that she is starting a course of study.  
  
2\. Maria can transfer from Disability Allowance (DA) to the Back to Education
Allowance (BTEA). If she chooses this option and qualifies for BTEA she will
not get the maintenance component of the student grant. Her rate of payment on
BTEA will be the same as her rate of Disability Allowance and she can keep any
secondary benefits she is currently getting.

She must still apply to SUSI to be assessed for the fee component of the
student grant, covering the student contribution and any tuition
fees/essential field trip costs.
