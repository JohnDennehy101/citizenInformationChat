##  Tax credits

Tax credits reduce the amount of tax that you have to pay. After your tax has
been calculated, the amount of the tax credit is deducted from the tax you
owe. This means that a tax credit has the same value whether you pay the
standard or higher rate of tax.

You may be entitled to various tax credits depending on your personal
circumstances. You can get more information about the [ different types of tax
