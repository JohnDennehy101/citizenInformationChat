###  Temporary basis

You may be taxed on a temporary basis called emergency tax if you are changing
job or starting work for the first time. You can check Revenueâ€™s current [
emergency tax and USC rates (pdf) ](https://www.revenue.ie/en/jobs-and-
pensions/documents/emergency-rates.pdf) . To avoid paying emergency tax you
should register the details of the new job with [ Revenue's Jobs and Pensions
online service in myAccount ](https://www.revenue.ie/en/online-
services/services/paye-services/add-job-pension.aspx) . You can get more
information about [ tax and starting work ](/en/employment/starting-work-and-
changing-job/starting-work/tax-and-starting-work/) or [ changing job
