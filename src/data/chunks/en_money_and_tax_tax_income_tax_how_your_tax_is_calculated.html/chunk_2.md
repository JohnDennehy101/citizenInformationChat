##  Introduction

Nearly all income is taxable, also known as being _liable_ to tax. Tax is
charged as a percentage of your income, which is called the rate of tax.

However, there are [ income tax reliefs ](/en/money-and-tax/tax/income-tax-
credits-and-reliefs/introduction-to-income-tax-credits-and-reliefs/) that
reduce the amount of tax you have to pay.

This page explains how tax rates and tax reliefs are used to calculate the tax
you pay.
