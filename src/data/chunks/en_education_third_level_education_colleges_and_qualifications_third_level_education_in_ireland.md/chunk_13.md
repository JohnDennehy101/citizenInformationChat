####  Listed awarding bodies

There are some awarding bodies whose qualifications are not included on the
National Framework of Qualifications (NFQ), for example, professional bodies
in areas of law and accountancy.

QQI has created a new category for these bodies called ‘listed awarding bodies
(LABs)’.

Under a new scheme, these bodies can apply for voluntary, regulated access to
the NFQ. The LABs scheme is expected to open in 2024 on a phased basis.
