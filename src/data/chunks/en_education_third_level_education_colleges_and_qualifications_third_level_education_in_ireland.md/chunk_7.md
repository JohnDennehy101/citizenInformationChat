##  Third-level qualifications

The [ National Framework of Qualifications (NFQ) ](https://www.qqi.ie/what-we-
do/the-qualifications-system/national-framework-of-qualifications) is a system
of 10 levels which allows the different standards and levels qualifications to
be compared. The NFQ is aligned to the [ European Framework of Qualifications.
](https://www.cedefop.europa.eu/en/events-and-projects/projects/european-
qualifications-framework-eqf) The NFQ can also help you to compare a foreign
qualification with its Irish equivalent and can help with the recognition of
Irish qualifications abroad.

You can see a [ diagram of the NFQ ](https://www.qqi.ie/what-we-do/the-
