delays where:

  * It was caused by weather that would make it unsafe to sail, or by extraordinary circumstances (for example, a natural disaster) 
  * You are travelling on an open ticket that does not state the time of departure 
  * You were told about the delay or cancellation before you bought the ticket, or your own actions caused the delay or cancellation
