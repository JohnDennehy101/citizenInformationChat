###  Making a claim for lost or damaged luggage or vehicle

You must give written notice to the travel operator if your luggage is lost or
damaged, and you find this out before, or at the time:

  * You left the ship (for cabin luggage) 
  * It is delivered to you (for all other luggage) 

If you do not find out about the damage or loss until later, you must write to
tell the company within 15 days of leaving the ship. If you don't do this you
can lose the right to compensation.
