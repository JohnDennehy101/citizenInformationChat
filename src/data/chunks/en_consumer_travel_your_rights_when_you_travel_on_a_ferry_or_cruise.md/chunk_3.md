##  Travel services covered

Companies operating ships must follow [ EU rules ](https://eur-
lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex:32010R1177) that protect
passengers. These rules apply to most ferries and cruise ships on the sea and
on _inland waterways_ (rivers, lakes and canals). They cover you if you:

  * Sail from an EU port 
  * Sail to an EU port from outside the EU on a service run by an EU transport company 
  * Sail from an EU port on a pleasure or recreational cruise if accommodation of 2 or more nights is offered, together with other facilities 

The rules do not cover you for travel on:

  * Ships that carry up to 12 passengers 
  * Ships with a crew of 3 or less 
  * Excursion and sightseeing tours (except for cruises) 
  * Journeys of up to 500 metres one way 
  * Non-mechanical propelled ships 
  * Historical passenger ships that carry up to 36 passengers 

Cruise holidays booked under a [ package holiday
](/en/consumer/travel/package-holidays/) are not covered by these rules,
unless the package is cancelled or delayed because of issues with the cruise
itself.
