###  Reductions in funding

The main area where reductions have been applied is in payments under the
Scheme of Compensatory Allowances in Disadvantaged Areas. Adjustments are also
being introduced to the Breeding and Welfare Scheme for Suckler Cows while
entry to the Early Retirement and Young Farmer Installation Scheme is
suspended. There are also reductions in Grants-in-Aid of between 8% and 9% for
Teagasc, An Bord Bia, the Marine Institute, Bord Iascaigh Mhara and the Sea
Fisheries Protection Authority and a reduced provision for certain capital
investment schemes.
