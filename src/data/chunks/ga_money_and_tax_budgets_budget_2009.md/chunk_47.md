###  Air travel tax

An air travel tax applying to all departures from Irish airports will come
into force on Monday 30 March 2009. The general rate will be €10 per
passenger. A lower rate of €2 will apply for air journeys under 300 km.

An indicative schedule listing the destinations from particular Irish airports
to which the lower rate will apply is set out below. Other destinations from
Irish airports in excess of 300km will attract the €10 rate.

The Finance Bill will provide that the tax will be payable by the appropriate
airport authority to the Revenue Commissioners for passengers departing from
Irish airports on and from 30 March 2009. In effect the airport authority will
collect the tax from the airlines.

The air travel tax will not apply to:

  * passengers under two years 
  * passengers with disabilities and people assisting them 
  * aircraft with less than 20 passenger seats 
  * transit passengers 
  * crew members 
  * air services to and from Irish offshore islands 
  * aircraft departing airports that had fewer than 10,000 departing passengers in the previous calendar year.
