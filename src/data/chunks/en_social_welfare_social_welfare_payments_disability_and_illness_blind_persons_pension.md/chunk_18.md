###  **One-Parent Family Payment**

If you qualify for [ One-Parent Family Payment (OFP)
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/social-welfare-
payments/families-and-children/one-parent-family-payment/) and Blind Pension,
you can get both payments at the full rate.

People who qualify for Blind Pension do not need to meet the child age
conditions for OFP. This means you can claim both Blind Pension and OFP
together until your youngest child is 16, including any increases for a
qualified child.

If you get Blind Pension and OFP, you [ cannot claim certain other benefits
](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/1cedd4-operational-guidelines-one-parent-
family-payment/#:~:text=Where%20a%20person%20is,Parents%20Benefit) .
