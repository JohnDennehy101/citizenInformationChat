####  **If you get a job, but stop working within 12 months**

If you get a job while getting Blind Pension, your rate of payment may be
reduced or stopped (depending on your new weekly means).

If your Blind Pension is stopped, you can be fast-tracked back onto the
payment if you stop work within 12 months.
