###  **How income from work is assessed for Blind Pension**

You can earn €165 per week from work (including self-employed work) without it
affecting your payment. This is called an ‘income disregard’.

If you earn more than €165 per week from work, half of your earnings from €165
and €375 are not taken into account in the Blind Pension means test.

The DSP assesses all your earnings over €375 in full.

There are no ‘disregards’ for your spouse, civil partner, or cohabitant's
earnings. This means their income from work is assessed in full.
