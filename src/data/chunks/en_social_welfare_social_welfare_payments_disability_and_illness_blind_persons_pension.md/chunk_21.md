###  **If you are over 18**

If you become blind or develop low vision after you turn 18, you should apply
as soon as possible. This is important, as the Department of Social Protection
will only pay Blind Pension from the date they get your application.

You cannot get Blind Pension after your 66th birthday. Instead, you will be
invited to apply for a [ State Pension (Contributory)
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/older-and-retired-
people/state-pension-contributory/) or [ State Pension (Non-contributory)
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/older-and-retired-
people/state-pension-non-contributory/) .
