###  Serving the notice

The District Court clerk will issue the claim notice to the solicitor for
service on the respondent. There are 2 ways to serve the claim notice:

  1. By hand (also known as personal service) 
  2. By registered prepaid post 

A copy of the notice should be given to the respondent personally. If attempts
to serve the respondent personally have been unsuccessful, a copy of the
notice can be given to the respondent’s spouse, civil partner, child (if they
live with the respondent), employee or agent at the respondent’s last known
residence or workplace, as long as that person is not under 16 years of age.

A copy of the notice may be sent by registered prepaid post to the
respondent's last known residence or place of business.
