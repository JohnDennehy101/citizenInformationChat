####  **How to apply for tax and duty relief when coming from a non-EU
country**

To apply, complete a [ Transfer of Residence from Non-EU Country Form (pdf)
](https://www.revenue.ie/en/customs/individuals/customs/c-and-e-1076.pdf) and
email it to Revenue at least 2 weeks before your vehicle arrives in Ireland.
You must include documents to support your application such as:

  * The carâ€™s logbook 
  * Proof of ownership 
  * Certificate of insurance and 
  * Evidence it was previously used abroad 

If you are bringing your vehicle by ferry from the UK, you should also ask for
a Pre-Boarding Notification ID.

Email the completed form to one of the following addresses, depending on the
area your vehicle is arriving:

**Port of entry** |  **Email**

Cork Port  |  [ TORSCorkPort@revenue.ie ](mailto:TORSCorkPort@revenue.ie)
