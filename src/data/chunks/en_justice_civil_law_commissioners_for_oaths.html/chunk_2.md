##  Introduction

A Commissioner for Oaths is a person who is authorised to witness the signing
of important legal documents, including [ affidavits
](/en/justice/witnesses/affidavit/) and statutory declarations. They are
appointed by the Chief Justice and are usually, though not always, a
solicitor. All practicing solicitors can also administer oaths. Unlike a [
Peace Commissioner ](/en/justice/civil-law/peace-commissioners/) , a
Commissioner for Oaths charges a fee for their services.
