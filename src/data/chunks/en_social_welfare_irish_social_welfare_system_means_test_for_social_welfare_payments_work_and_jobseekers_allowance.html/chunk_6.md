####  What if my partner is on an employment scheme?

You can claim an increase for your spouse, civil partner or cohabitant if they
started a [ Community Employment (CE) ](/en/employment/unemployment-and-
redundancy/employment-support-schemes/community-employment-scheme/) scheme
before 1 January 2023 or they are taking part in a TÃºs or Gateway scheme.
Their earnings from the scheme are assessed in the same way as earnings from
work (and your combined means are **not** halved) - see 'Spouse, civil
partner's, cohabitant's income from work' below.

If your spouse, civil partner or cohabitant **start CE in 2023** your means
will be halved, you can find more about [ how CE earnings are assessed in the
means test for Jobseeker's Allowance ](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-
welfare-system/means-test-for-social-welfare-payments/means-test-for-
jobseekers-allowance/) .
