##  Calculating means from work

Here we show you how to calculate your means from employment (not self-
employment). You can find out how income from self-employment is assessed in
our document [ Self-employment and unemployment ](/en/social-
welfare/unemployed-people/self-employed-and-unemployment/) .

**Assessable earnings from work**

The following items are always deducted from your gross earnings to get your
assessable earnings from work:

  * [ PRSI (social insurance contributions) ](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/social-insurance-prsi/social-insurance/)
  * Union dues 
  * Superannuation (pension) 
  * PRSAs (Personal Retirement Savings Accounts) 
  * AVCs (Additional Voluntary Contributions). 

You cannot deduct income tax or Universal Social Charge.

There are 2 stages to calculating how work will affect your Jobseekerâ€™s
Allowance.
