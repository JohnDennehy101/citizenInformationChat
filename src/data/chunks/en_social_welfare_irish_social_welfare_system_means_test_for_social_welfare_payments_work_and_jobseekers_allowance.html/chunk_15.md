###  Getting JA before 20 November 1996  

If you were getting JA on 20 November 1996 and have continued to get JA
continuously, you can continue to be assessed using the method of calculating
means from employment in place at that time to find out if you would get a
greater amount of JA.

If your means have changed, for any reason since the 20 November 1996, you
cannot apply this method of calculating means from employment.

**Before 20 November 1996 your spouse's, civil partner's or cohabitant's
income from employment affected your JA payment as follows:**

The following method of assessing means from insurable employment applies if
you were getting JA on the 20th November 1996 and have continued to get JA
continuously and if this method of assessment is of greater benefit than that
under the current method of assessment of earnings from work. If your means
have changed, for any reason since the 20th November 1996, the saver rate will
not apply.

The following is how your means are assessed using the Saver Clause:

  * Your pattern of employment is established (that is, your average number of days worked each week) 
  * Average net weekly earnings are established (i.e. gross earnings less income tax, PRSI, VHI, BUPA, HSF, superannuation and union dues) 
  * A certain amount of your average net weekly earnings are not taken into account, this is called an earnings disregard. One-sixth of the maximum weekly rate of Job Seeker's Allowance plus €19.05 for each day worked. If you work Sunday only €19.05 is not taken into account. 
  * The total amount disregarded is deducted from the net earnings and the balance is taken as your weekly means.
