##  Spouse’s, civil partner’s or cohabitant's income from work

Your spouse's, civil partner's or cohabitant's income from employment is
assessed in the means test for Jobseeker’s Allowance.

Their income from work is assessed in the same way as your income from work
(if any). To work out what your spouse's, civil partner's or cohabitant's
means from work is:

  * Deduct €20 per day from your spouse's, civil partner's or cohabitant's assessable earnings for each day worked up to a maximum of €60 (including Sunday) 
  * Next get 60% of the balance. This is assessed as his or her weekly means from work. 

Assessable weekly earnings - €20 per day (maximum €60 for 3 days work) = total
x 60% = weekly means from work.

Your spouse's, civil partner's or cohabitant's income from self-employment is
fully assessed in the means test for Jobseeker’s Allowance and there are no
disregards.

Earnings are assessed as gross income less work related expenses over 12
months. The expected annual earnings from self-employment is divided by 52 to
find your spouse's, civil partner's or cohabitant's weekly means from self-
employment.
