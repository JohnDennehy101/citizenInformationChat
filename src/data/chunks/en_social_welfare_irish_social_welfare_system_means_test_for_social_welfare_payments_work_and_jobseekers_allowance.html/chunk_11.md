###  Seasonal earnings

The definition of seasonal employment is that:

  * It is created annually as a result of a particular seasonal variation in the amount of work, and terminates at the end of that season. 
  * The start and end dates may vary from season to season and from worker to worker, but overall there should be a clearly discernible beginning and end to the season. 
  * The length of the season should not generally exceed six months. 

In determining whether a person is involved in seasonal employment the nature
of the business is investigated, as well as the nature of the person's
employment.

Some of the typical areas where seasonal employments exist are turf harvesting
with Bord na Mona, fish processing and hotels, restaurants and shops in areas
where there is a limited tourist season.

Once the season is over, the means from seasonal employment are excluded from
the assessment until the commencement of the next season.
