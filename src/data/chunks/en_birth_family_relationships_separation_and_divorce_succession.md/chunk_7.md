##  What if I have a will?

A [ will ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/death/before-a-death/making-
a-will/) is a written document explaining what you would like to happen to
your possessions after you die.

Your spouse or civil partner is still legally entitled to a share in your
estate, even if your will does not mention them.
