##  What are succession rights?

Succession is when a person dies and their property is inherited by their
spouse, civil partner, or children.

Succession rights are set out in law. This means that if your spouse or civil
partner dies, you are automatically entitled to a share of their _estate_ .
Their estate is all their possessions, including money, belongings, and
property.
