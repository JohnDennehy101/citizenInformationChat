##  Succession rights after a divorce

If you are divorced, you do not have automatic succession rights to your ex-
spouse's estate. This is because succession rights end when the court grants a
‘ [ decree of divorce ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/birth-family-
relationships/separation-and-divorce/divorce-decrees/) ’.

However, your ex-spouse may leave something to you in their will.

In certain circumstances, you can apply to the court for a share of your
former spouse’s estate. Read ‘applying for a share of your former spouse’s
estate’ below.
