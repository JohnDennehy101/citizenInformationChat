###  **What if I am not legally separated?**

If you and your spouse were living apart, but you did not have a formal [
separation agreement ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/birth-family-
relationships/separation-and-divorce/judicial-separation/) or [ divorce
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/birth-family-relationships/separation-
and-divorce/divorce-decrees/) , you are still viewed as spouses by the law.
This means you are still entitled to the appropriate share of your deceased
spouseâ€™s estate (possessions).
