##  Introduction

The sale of alcoholic drinks is controlled by law, and only licensed
businesses can serve or sell alcohol. It is an offence to serve alcohol to a
person under 18, and pubs, hotels and restaurants that serve alcohol can do so
only during specified hours.

This page describes the law on alcohol in Ireland, the penalties for breaking
those laws and the powers the Garda√≠ have to enforce them.
