##  Drinks promotions and ‘happy hours’

It is against the law to reduce the price of alcohol at specific times of the
day. This means that ‘ [ happy hours’ are against the law

in Ireland.

Other drinks promotions and special offers are illegal including:

  * Loyalty card programmes that reward customers for buying alcohol 
  * Promotions that allow for alcoholic drinks to be sold at a reduced price or given away for free when bought alongside other products 
  * Short term price promotions where the price of an alcoholic drink is reduced for a period of less than 3 days
