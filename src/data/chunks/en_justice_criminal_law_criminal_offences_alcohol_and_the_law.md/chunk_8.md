###  Children in pubs

You can bring your child (under 18) to a pub with you with some restrictions:

  * Children under 15 must be supervised at all times 
  * Children under 15 can only be on the premises between the hours of 10:30 am and 9:00 pm (10:00 pm from May to September) 
  * Children aged 15 and over, who are accompanied by their parent or guardian, can stay on the premises after 9:00 (10:00 pm from May to September) if they are attending a private function where a substantial meal is being served 

The licence holder (normally the pub owner) can also refuse to allow a child
or children on the premises if they believe that doing so would be harmful to
the childâ€™s health, safety or welfare.
