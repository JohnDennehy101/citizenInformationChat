###  Qualifying and permitted family members

In EU law, there are 2 types of family member who can apply for a residence
card based on EU law: qualifying family members and permitted family members.

The following are **qualifying family members** :

  * Your spouse or civil partner 
  * Your child or the child of your spouse under the age of 21 
  * Your grandchild or your spouse’s grandchild under the age of 21 
  * Your dependent parent 
  * Your dependent grandparent 
  * Your direct, dependent descendants or direct, dependent relatives in the ascending line (for example, great grandparents or great grandchildren) 

Children over 21 are generally considered qualifying family members if they
are in education, or are dependent on you due to an illness or disability. You
will have to show that your parents or grandparents were dependent on you
before they came to Ireland.
