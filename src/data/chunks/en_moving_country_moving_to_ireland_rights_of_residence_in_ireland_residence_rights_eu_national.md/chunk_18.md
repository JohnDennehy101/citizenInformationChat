###  Changes in circumstances

Your family memberâ€™s residence is based on your right to reside as an EEA or
Swiss citizen. If the relationship between you and the non-EEA citizen changes
and they want to stay in Ireland, they may be able to apply to retain their
status. This applies if:

  * The EEA or Swiss citizen dies 
  * The EEA or Swiss citizen leaves Ireland and the non-EEA citizen is caring for children in Ireland 
  * The relationship ends through divorce, annulment or dissolution of a civil partnership 

Applications for retention of a residence card are made on [ Form EUTR 5
](https://www.irishimmigration.ie/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Form-EUTR5.pdf) .
