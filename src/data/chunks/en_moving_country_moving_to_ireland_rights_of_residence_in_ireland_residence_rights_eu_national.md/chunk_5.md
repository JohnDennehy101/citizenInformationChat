##  Worker status and former worker status

If you are an EEA or Swiss citizen, you can stay in Ireland for up to 6 months
if you have moved here and are [ looking for work ](/en/moving-
country/working-in-ireland/migrant-workers/coming-from-eu-to-work/) . You can
transfer your unemployment benefit from your country of origin and it will be
paid to you in Ireland for up to 3 months (can be up to 6 months in some
cases).

You have a right to live in Ireland if you are working.

In EU law, a worker is any person who undertakes ‘genuine and effective’ work
for which they are paid under the direction of someone else. You do not have
to be earning over a particular amount, or working a particular number of
hours per week, to be an EU worker.

You are also legally resident in Ireland if you are self-employed and your
work is ‘genuine and effective’.

If you have lived in Ireland as an EU worker or self-employed person for 5
years, you have a permanent right of residence in Ireland.
