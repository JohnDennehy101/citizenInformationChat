##  Right to enter Ireland

You do not need a visa or preclearance to come to Ireland if you are a citizen
of the EEA or Switzerland.

Ireland is not part of the [ Schengen Area ](/en/government-in-
ireland/european-government/european-union/schengen-area/) .

Because of [ free movement rules in the EU ](/en/government-in-
ireland/european-government/european-union/freedom-of-movement-in-the-eu/) ,
you can only be refused entry to Ireland in very limited situations:

  * You are suffering from a serious contagious disease which poses a serious threat to the population 
  * Your past behaviour, including any criminal convictions you may have, is deemed to pose a substantial risk to public security or public policy
