###  Your family

Your family can travel with you. If members of your family are not citizens of
the EEA, Switzerland or the UK, they may [ need a visa to enter Ireland
](/en/moving-country/visas-for-ireland/visa-requirements-for-entering-
ireland/) .

If your family member has a residence card under EU regulations issued by
another EEA country or Switzerland, they do not need a visa to enter Ireland.
You should note that a family member normally gets this type of residence card
if you are residing in a country that is not your country of nationality.

If you are not sure about the type of residence card your family members have,
you should check with the immigration authorities in the country where you
live.
