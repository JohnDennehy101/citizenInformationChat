##  Introduction

If you are an EU citizen, you have certain residency rights in Ireland. You
also have residency rights if you are a citizen of the European Economic Area
(EEA) and Switzerland. The **EEA** is made up of the member states of the EU,
plus Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein.

Your right to reside depends on what you are doing in Ireland. Your residence
rights also apply to certain family members, even if they are not EEA or Swiss
citizens themselves.

You can enter Ireland and stay here for up to 3 months (6 months if you are
looking for a job) without restriction. If you plan to stay more than 3
months, you must either:

  * Be working (either employed or self-employed) 
  * Have enough money and sickness insurance to support yourself and your family 
  * Be enrolled as a student or vocational trainee or 
  * Be a family member of an EEA or Swiss citizen in one of the previous categories. 

When you come to Ireland, you do not need to register with the local
immigration office and you do not need a residence card to live here. If you
have family members from outside the UK, EEA or Switzerland, they must:

  * Apply for residence 
  * Register and get an Irish Residence Permit 

They may also need to [ apply for a visa ](/en/moving-country/visas-for-
