##  People with ‘sufficient resources’

You can live in Ireland for as long as you have enough money to support
yourself and your family, and you have comprehensive health insurance.

There is no fixed amount of money needed to show that you have enough money to
support yourself and your family.

This category often applies to pensioners who decide to live in Ireland and
who get a pension from another country that is enough for them to live on.
