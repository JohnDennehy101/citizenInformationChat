##  Residence based on ‘derivative’rights (parents of EEA or Swiss dependent
children)

The [ Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU)
](https://curia.europa.eu/jcms/jcms/j_6/en/) has made some important decisions
about the right to reside of parents of a child with EEA or Swiss citizenship.
These rights are called ‘derivative rights’ of residence. They are important
in situations where an EEA or Swiss parent does not have a legal right to
reside based on their own activities, or a Non-EEA citizen cannot apply for a
residence card based on the activities of their EEA or Swiss spouse or
partner.

A Non-EEA citizen can apply for residence based on a derivative right, or an
EEA or Swiss citizen can derive a legal right of residence in the State, which
could be important for claiming a social welfare payment or access to local
authority housing.

A person with derivative rights does not automatically qualify for permanent
residence.

This table has examples of cases where a derivative right of residence was
granted by the CJEU, and explains who can claim residence based on the CJEU
decision.
