##  Students

You have the right to live in Ireland if you are:

  * Enrolled in an approved college 
  * Have enough income to live without needing support from the social welfare system in Ireland 
  * Have comprehensive health insurance 

Your right to live in Ireland ends when your studies end, unless you have a
legal right to live on another basis (for example, you get a job, or you have
sufficient resources).
