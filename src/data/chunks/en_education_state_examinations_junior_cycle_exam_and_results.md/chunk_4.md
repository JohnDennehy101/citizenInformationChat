##  Junior Cycle awards and grades

In 2022, the [ Junior Cycle Profile of Achievement (JCPA)
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/education/primary-and-post-primary-
education/going-to-post-primary-school/junior-cycle/#2bbc81) fully replaced
the Junior Certificate. It adds a classroom-based assessment to the exam which
is based on work completed by the student during second and third year.

Read about the changes to the Junior Cycle on the [ National Council for
Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA) ](https://www.curriculumonline.ie/Junior-
Cycle/Junior-Cycle-is-changing/) website.
