##  Dial to Stop Drug Dealing

Dial to Stop Drug Dealing is an initiative to tackle drug dealing in local
communities around Ireland. It provides a confidential and completely
anonymous way for individuals to pass on information on drug dealing in their
local community. When people are reporting drug dealing activity, they are
never asked for their names or addresses, or any other information which might
identify them.
