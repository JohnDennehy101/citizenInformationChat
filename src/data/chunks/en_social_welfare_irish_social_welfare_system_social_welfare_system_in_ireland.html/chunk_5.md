####  **Who decides if I can receive a payment?**

For most social insurance and social assistance payments, Deciding Officers
decide if you are entitled to the payment. Deciding Officers are social
welfare officials appointed under the social welfare legislation.

Other payments such as those under the [ Supplementary Welfare Allowance
Scheme ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/social-welfare-
payments/supplementary-welfare-schemes/supplementary-welfare-allow/) and
certain administrative schemes are made by other officials within the
Department of Social Protection.

Some payments are not based in legislation but are based on government
decisions and administrative guidelines. For example:

  * [ Christmas Bonus ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/christmas-bonus/)
  * [ Fuel Allowance ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/social-welfare-payments/extra-social-welfare-benefits/fuel-allowance/)

**Can I appeal a decision to not award me a payment?**

If you are not happy with a decision, [ you can appeal decisions for payments
that are based in legislation ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-
welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/social-welfare-appeals/) .

**If a claim is fraudulent**

If a person makes a false or misleading statement to get a social welfare
payment for themselves or for any other person, they may face large fines or
prison for up to 3 years.

The Department of Social Protection has a [ Compliance and Fraud Strategy
](http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/Compliance-and-Anti-Fraud-
Strategy-2014-2018-.aspx) that aims to reduce social welfare fraud.
