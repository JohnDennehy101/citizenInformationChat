##  Types of social welfare payment

The social welfare system in Ireland is divided into 3 main types of payments.
These are:

  * Social insurance payments 
  * Social assistance payments (also knowns as means-tested payments) 
  * Universal payments 

You can find an explanation for each type below.

With all social welfare payments, you must meet specific circumstances to
qualify for the payment. For example, to claim the [ One-Parent Family Payment
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/social-welfare-
payments/families-and-children/one-parent-family-payment/) , you must be
parenting alone and not cohabiting with your spouse or partner.

There is also a range of [ employment schemes and other supports

redundancy/employment-support-schemes/schemes-to-support-employment/) which
support long-term unemployed people to return to work.

You must be [ habitually resident to qualify for social assistance payments

Social insurance payments  |  You can claim a social insurance payment if you:  · Have enough insurance contributions (PRSI conditions)  · Meet the specific conditions  These conditions vary, depending on the payment you apply for.

Means-tested payments  (also known as social assistance payments)  |  You will get a means-tested payment if you do not have enough PRSI contributions to qualify for the equivalent social insurance-based payments.  A means test is where the Department of Social Protection examines all your income to see if it is below a certain level.  How your means are tested depends on the payment.  You may be allowed some income or savings before your entitlement to a payment is affected. This is known as an income disregard.  |  If you do not have enough social insurance contributions to apply for [ Jobseeker's Benefit ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/social-welfare-payments/unemployed-people/jobseekers-benefit/) , you can apply for [ Jobseeker's Allowance ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/social-welfare-payments/unemployed-people/jobseekers-allowance/) .   
Universal payments  |  You can get a universal payment regardless of your income or social insurance record.  To qualify, you must meet specific personal circumstances.  |  [ Child Benefit ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/social-welfare-payments/families-and-children/child-benefit/)
