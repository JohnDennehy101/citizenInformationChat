##  How to apply

If your employer does not operate an occupational pension scheme, or if
certain restrictions apply to the scheme it does offer, your employer must
provide access to at least one Standard PRSA. T

This rule applies to all employers, regardless of the number of employees and
whether they are full-time, part-time, fixed-term or contract.

Contact the HR manager or Payroll Section at your employment to find out more
about the Standard PRSA(s) they provide.
