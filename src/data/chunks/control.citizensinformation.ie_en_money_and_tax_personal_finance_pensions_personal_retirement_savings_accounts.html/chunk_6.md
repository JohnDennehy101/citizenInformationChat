##  Do you need a PRSA?

If you are considering whether to invest in a PRSA, you should ask yourself
the following questions.

**Is there an existing pension scheme available to me in my job?**

If not, you should consider making provision for your retirement and a PRSA
may be the option for you. If you already have a good pension arrangement, you
may not need to make any additional provision, or you may be able to top up
your benefits by making Additional Voluntary Contributions (AVCs). If there is
no AVC facility, your employer must provide access to a PRSA.

**Should I start a PRSA if I already have a personal pension plan?**

You should seek professional advice based on your circumstances. Contact a
broker or your pension provider for more information.

**Do I need a PRSA if I already have a defined benefit scheme?**

Defined benefit pension schemes promise a pension related to your salary (for
example, two-thirds of final salary on retirement). You may not need to make
any further pension provisions if you have this type of pension. Transferring
from a defined benefit scheme into a PRSA involves a risk so you will need to
assess your financial position and weigh up the advantages and disadvantages.

**Do I need a PRSA if I have a defined contribution scheme?**

A defined contribution scheme is also based on investment and has an
investment risk - your pension will depend on the contributions you make,
together with the investment performance of your fund, less any charges. If
your employer is making a contribution to your existing scheme, you should
find out whether this will continue if you transfer to a PRSA.
