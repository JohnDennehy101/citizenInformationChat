###  Positive action

Positive action is where an employer takes specific steps to improve equality
in a workplace by employing a person from an underrepresented group.

The law also allows for positive action on a number of grounds including age.
For example, a company could use positive action statement in recruitment ads
to say they welcome applications from people over a certain age.
