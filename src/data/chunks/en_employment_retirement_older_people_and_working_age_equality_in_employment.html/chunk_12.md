##  If you think you've been discriminated against

If you feel that you have been discriminated against on the grounds of age,
there are several steps you can follow.

  1. Talk to your employer to try and resolve the problem. 
  2. If this doesnâ€™t work, make a complaint to the WRC using the [ online complaint form ](https://www.workplacerelations.ie/en/Complaints_Disputes/Refer_a_Dispute_Make_a_Complaint/) . You must make your complaint **within 6 months** of the last act of discrimination. The time limit can be extended by a further 6 months, but only if there is valid reason why you could not make the complaint sooner.
