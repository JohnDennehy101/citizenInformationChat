###  Compensation and refunds

If your service is seriously delayed for any reason within the control of
Iarnród Éireann, you could be [ entitled to a discount voucher
](http://www.irishrail.ie/travel-information/irish-domestic-rail-
travel#compensation) . The value of discount voucher is based on the length of
delay and the fare you have paid for your single journey (that is,
approximately half the value of a return fare).

Refunds in discount vouchers are also given if your seat reservation is not
honoured and no seat of the same standard is available to you.

If the train you planned to catch is delayed or cancelled and you decide not
to travel, you will be given a full cash refund if you return your unused
ticket immediately to the ticket office where you bought it.

If you decide for some other reason not to use a rail ticket you have bought,
you can [ apply for a refund ](http://www.irishrail.ie/travel-
information/irish-domestic-rail-travel#refunds) at any main InterCity station,
the Dart office in Pearse Station or any Travel Centre. There may be an
administration fee. If you did not buy your ticket from Iarnród Éireann, you
should return it to the place where you bought it. The ticket issuer will
arrange any refund due and may make a reasonable administration charge.
