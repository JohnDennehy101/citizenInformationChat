##  Introduction

Ireland's Parliament (Oireachtas) has the power to establish tribunals of
inquiry to investigate certain matters of public importance. If the Government
considers that a particular issue of controversy or dispute is of such public
importance that a [ public inquiry ](/en/government-in-ireland/how-government-
works/tribunals-and-investigations/tribunals-introduction/) is necessary, it
can propose propose a resolution to set up a tribunal of inquiry.

These tribunals are not permanent tribunals. Instead, they are set up with
powers to investigate specific matters. They are usually chaired by judges or
senior lawyers.

At the end of the investigation, the tribunal submits a report to the
Oireachtas, which may contain recommendations.
