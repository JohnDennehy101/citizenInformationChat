###  What are 'qualified' cohabitants?

To apply for court orders under the redress scheme, you must be a _qualified
cohabitant_ . This means you must have been:

  * A cohabitant (living together in an intimate and committed relationship) for at least 5 years, or 
  * A cohabitant (living together in an intimate and committed relationship) for 2 years if you have had a child with your partner
