##  Application for provision from the estate of a deceased partner

If you are in cohabitating relationship and your partner dies, you can apply
for provisions to be made for you from their estate. The court may grant a
share of the estate to you if proper provision was not made for you in your
deceased partner’s lifetime or in a bequest in their will. It is not necessary
to prove that you were financially dependent on them.

You must notify the personal representative of the deceased of your
application for provision from the deceased’s estate within 6 months of [ an
application for a grant of probate

with-the-deceaseds-estate/) .

In general, if your cohabiting relationship ended two years or more before
your ex-partner died, you cannot apply for provision from the estate unless
you were getting regular or periodic payments from the deceased.
