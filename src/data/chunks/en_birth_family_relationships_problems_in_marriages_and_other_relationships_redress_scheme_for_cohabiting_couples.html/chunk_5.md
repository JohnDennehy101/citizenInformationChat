##  Applying for redress from the court

If you are a qualified cohabitant and you were financially dependent on your
former partner, you can apply to the court for court orders, such as:

  * A maintenance order 
  * Property adjustment order 
  * Pension adjustment order 

You do not have an automatic right to get these orders granted. Instead, the
court must be satisfied that you were financially dependent on your cohabitant
partner.
