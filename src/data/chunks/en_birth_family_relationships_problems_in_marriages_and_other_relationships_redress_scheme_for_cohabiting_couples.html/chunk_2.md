##  Introduction

Living together with someone is also sometimes called ‘cohabitation’. If you
have been living in an intimate and committed relationship with your partner
and your relationship ends, you may qualify for the ‘redress scheme for
cohabiting couples’. The aim of the redress scheme is to provide a legal
safety net for a financially dependent member of the couple if the long-term
cohabiting relationship ends (either through death or separation).

Under the redress scheme, cohabiting couples can get similar types of orders
from the court as are available to married couples when they separate or
divorce (for example, a ‘maintenance order’ or ‘property adjustment order’).

The rules of the scheme are set out in the [ Civil Partnership and Certain
Rights and Obligations of Cohabitants Act 2010
