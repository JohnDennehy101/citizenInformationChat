####  If you are unfit for work for 3 days or less

If you are unfit for work for 3 days or less, and you would otherwise qualify
for Injury Benefit, you can still register a claim for Injury Benefit (see
‘How to apply for Injury Benefit’ below).

This creates a record of the workplace-related injury, which you can use to
benefit under the [ Occupational Injuries Benefit Scheme ](/en/social-
welfare/disability-and-illness/occupational-injuries-benefit-overview/) , if
illness or disablement develops at a later date.
