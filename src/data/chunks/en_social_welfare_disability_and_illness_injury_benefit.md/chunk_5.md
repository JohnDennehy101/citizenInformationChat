###  Social insurance (PRSI) contributions

To get Injury Benefit, you must be in employment [ insurable at PRSI Class A,
D, J or M ](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/social-insurance-
prsi/social-insurance-classes/) . At class M, only employees aged under 16 are
covered.

You do not need a certain number of PRSI contributions to qualify for Injury
Benefit.

You will qualify if you are unfit for work because of an occupational disease
or an accident at work or an accident while travelling to or from work.

Civil servants who started work before April 1995 and are insured at Class B
do not qualify for Injury Benefit. But you can get a declaration that an
occupational accident occurred and you may qualify for other benefits under
the Occupational Injuries Benefits Scheme.
