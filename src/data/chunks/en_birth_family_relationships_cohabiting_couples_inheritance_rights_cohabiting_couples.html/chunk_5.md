##  If your partner has not made a willor has not provided for you

A financially dependent cohabitant may be able to apply to the courts for
provision to be made for you from the estate of your deceased partner if the
relationship ends as the result of death or otherwise. This is known as the [
redress scheme for cohabiting couples ](/en/birth-family-
relationships/problems-in-marriages-and-other-relationships/redress-scheme-
for-cohabiting-couples/) . If you get redress by a court under this scheme,
you may be exempt from paying Capital Acquisition Tax.
