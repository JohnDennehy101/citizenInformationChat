##  Introduction

If you are at least 18 years old and of sound mind, you may [ make a will
](/en/death/before-a-death/making-a-will/) . If you later get married or if
you entered a civil partnership, that will is automatically cancelled unless
it was made with that marriage or civil partnership in mind. However, if you
enter into cohabitation (that is, move in to live with a partner), it has no
effect on your pre-existing will.
