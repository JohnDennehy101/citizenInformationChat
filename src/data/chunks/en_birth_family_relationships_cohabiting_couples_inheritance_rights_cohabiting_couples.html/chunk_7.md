##  Cohabitants' agreement

Cohabitants can enter into a “cohabitants’ agreement” which will govern your
financial responsibilities to one another. To be valid, the cohabitants’
agreement must be in writing and signed by both cohabitants. Both of you must
have received legal advice before entering into the agreement. Preferably,
each cohabitant will have received separate legal advice.

A cohabitant’s agreement can specify that either party cannot make an
application under the redress scheme. However, a court can override this in
exceptional circumstances where it would cause serious injustice.

It is very important to discuss the matter of inheritance during your
relationship with your partner and seek legal advice.
