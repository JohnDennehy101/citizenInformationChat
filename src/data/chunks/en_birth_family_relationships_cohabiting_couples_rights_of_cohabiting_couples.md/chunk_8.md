##  Preparing for the future with a cohabitation agreement

If you live with your partner and you do not intend to marry, you can protect
your financial interests by entering into a ‘cohabitation agreement’ (also
called a cohabitant’s agreement). This is a voluntary, signed agreement, which
allows you to specify the day-to-day joint financial arrangements of your
relationship.

You can also specify how you plan to separate your assets, such as shared
property, should the relationship come to an end. You both need to get
independent legal advice for the agreement to be valid. The advantage of a
cohabitation agreement is that you prepare for future events while your
relationship is still amicable. This should mean the plans you make are fair
and reasonable to both of you.
