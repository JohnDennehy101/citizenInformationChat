##  What rights does a cohabiting partner have?

While couples living together now have certain rights in the event of the
death of either partner, or the breakup of your relationship, cohabiting
couples do not have the same legal rights and obligations as [ married couples
](/en/birth-family-relationships/married-couples/how-marriage-changes-your-
legal-status/) or [ civil partnerships ](/en/birth-family-relationships/civil-
partnerships/civil-partnerships/) . This has a bearing on important life
events, including buying property, having children and inheritance.

For example, if you are living with your partner and you die without a will,
your partner has no automatic right to any share of your estate (property,
money and possessions) no matter how long you have been together.

Even if your partner has provided for you in their will, cohabiting partners
pay [ Capital Acquisitions Tax (CAT) ](/en/money-and-tax/tax/capital-
taxes/capital-acquisitions-tax/) at 33% on gifts/inheritance over â‚¬16,250.
However, if you receive a gift or inheritance from your spouse (your husband
or your wife) or your civil partner, you are exempt from Capital Acquisitions
Tax (CAT).

Given the legal differences between being married and living together, this
page signposts you to some of the issues you should consider if you are living
with your partner:
