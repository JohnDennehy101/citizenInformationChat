##  Redress scheme for cohabiting couples

If you have been living with your partner and your relationship ends, you may
be able to avail of the [ Redress scheme for cohabiting couples ](/en/birth-
family-relationships/problems-in-marriages-and-other-relationships/redress-
scheme-for-cohabiting-couples/) . The aim of the redress scheme is to protect
a financially dependent member of the couple if the long-term cohabiting
relationship ends (either through death or separation).

Under the redress scheme, cohabiting couples can get similar orders from the
court as are available to married couples when they separate or divorce if the
court is satisfied that one of you was financially dependent on the other. The
types of orders you may apply for under the redress scheme include property
adjustment orders, maintenance orders and pension adjustment orders.

To apply for court orders under the redress scheme, you must be a qualified
cohabitant. This means you must have been:

  * Living together in an intimate and committed relationship for at least 5 years, or 
  * Living together in an intimate and committed relationship for 2 years if you have had a child with your partner 

You must apply for these orders within two years of your relationship ending,
unless there are exceptional circumstances. The rules of the scheme are set
out in the Cohabitants are defined in the [ Civil Partnership and Certain
Rights and Obligations of Cohabitants Act 2010
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2010/en/act/pub/0024/index.html) .
