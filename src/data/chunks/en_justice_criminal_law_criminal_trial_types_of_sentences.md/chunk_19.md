###  Compensation

The [ Criminal Justice Act 1993
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1993/en/act/pub/0006/index.html) means judges
can order you to pay compensation. This may be in addition to or instead of
any other punishment. The amount of compensation which a court can order is
limited to the amount it could award in damages in a civil case.

**Court compensation limits** **Court** |  **Maximum Compensation**  
---|---  
District Court  |  €15,000   
Circuit Court  |  €75,000   
  
The court must take your means and your financial commitments into account
when making a compensation order. Compensation orders may be enforced. For
example, the court can order an attachment of earnings.
