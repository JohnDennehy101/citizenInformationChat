###  Orders for sex offenders

As well as the general sentencing options available for all offences, a judge
can make a number of specific orders when dealing with sexual offences. This
is provided for by the [ Sex Offenders Act 2001
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2001/act/18/enacted/en/html) .

A judge can make the following orders if you are a convicted sex offender:

**Notification order** : Obliges you to notify the Gardaí of your name and
address.

**Certificate** : States that you have been convicted of the sexual offence,
your sentence and that there is a notification requirement.

**Obligation to notify employers** : If you are applying for employment which
involves unsupervised access to or contact with a child or mentally impaired
person, you are ordered to notify the employer or potential employer of your
conviction for sex offences.

**Sex offender order** : If the Court believes it is necessary to protect the
public from you, it can make such an order prohibiting you from carrying out
certain activities.

**Post-release supervision order** : If the Court considers it necessary it
can impose conditions on you for when you are released from prison. These
conditions will be supervised by the Probation Service and the Gardaí.
