###  Minimum sentences

Generally, sentencing is left to the discretion of the judge. However, there
are a number of laws which take this discretion away from the judge and they
must impose **at least** a minimum sentence.

For example, the [ Criminal Justice Act 2006
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2006/act/26/enacted/en/print) sets out a
number offences in relation to firearms which carry a minimum sentence if you
are [ convicted on indictment ](/en/justice/criminal-law/criminal-
trial/criminal-trial/) . If it is your first offence, the judge has the
discretion to impose a lesser sentence. In these cases the judge will take
certain things into account, such as if you plead guilty or assisted the
Gardaí. However, if it is your second or subsequent firearms offence, then the
minimum sentence applies.
