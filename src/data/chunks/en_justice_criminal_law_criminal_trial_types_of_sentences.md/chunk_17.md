###  Court poor box

The court poor box is another way judges can deal with less serious offences
in the District Court. If you agree, you may be required to pay a sum of money
into the court poor box. Usually this is as an alternative to having a
conviction recorded against you. Judges only really consider this option if
you are a first-time offender who has committed a minor offence, such as,
littering or parking offences. This option is only available if you plead
guilty or where there are special circumstances explaining your behaviour.
