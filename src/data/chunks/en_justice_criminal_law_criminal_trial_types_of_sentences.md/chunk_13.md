###  Curfews and exclusion orders

Judges sometimes use curfews and/or exclusion orders as a sentencing option.
These orders are often used as a condition of bail or a suspended sentence.

The court can make an order that means you have to be at home at a particular
address between certain hours of the day or night. Similarly, the judge might
ban you from a certain street or premises, for example, a pub or licensed
premises.
