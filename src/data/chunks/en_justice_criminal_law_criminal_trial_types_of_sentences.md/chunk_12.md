###  Fines

Many offences provide for a fine to be imposed. Often, offences will provide
for a fine and/or another punishment (usually a prison sentence), while other
offences attract only a fine. If a fine exceeds a certain amount ( [ class A
fine ](/en/justice/criminal-law/criminal-trial/fines-for-criminal-offences/) )
the offence may be outside the jurisdiction of the [ District Court
](/en/justice/courts-system/district-court/) which can only deal with minor
offences.

When a fine is imposed, the judge normally specifies when the fine must be
paid by. If the fine is not paid within the time period provided by the judge,
you can be sent to prison. In the District Court, the imprisonment default
periods are:

**Default periods in prison for not paying fines** **Amount of Fine** |  **Imprisonment in default**  
---|---  
Less than €500  |  5 days   
Between €500 and €1,500  |  10 days   
Between €1,500 and €3,000  |  20 days   
Greater than €3,000  |  30 days   
  
Under the [ Fines (Payment and Recovery) Act 2014
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2014/act/7/enacted/en/html) judges can
give you community service instead of sending you to prison for failing to pay
a fine.
