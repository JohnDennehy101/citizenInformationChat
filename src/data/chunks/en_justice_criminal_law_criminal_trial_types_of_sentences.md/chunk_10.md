###  Suspended sentences

A suspended sentence means the judge imposes a prison sentence but suspends it
on certain conditions. This means that you do not go to prison if you keep the
conditions. A suspended sentence contains 3 elements:

  * The term of imprisonment (for example, 4 years) 
  * The conditions on which it is suspended (for example, to keep the peace and be of good behaviour or to undergo certain treatment) 
  * The period for which the sentence is suspended 

If you break a condition when the sentence is suspended, you will have to
serve the prison term that was originally imposed.
