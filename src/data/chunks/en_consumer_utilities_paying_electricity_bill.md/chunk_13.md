###  Smart meters

Since 2019, ESB Networks has been fitting homes and businesses with _smart
meters_ . Smart meters are the next generation of electricity meters and it is
planned that all homes in Ireland will be fitted with smart meters by the end
of 2024.

Smart meters will automatically communicate your electricity usage to your
supplier, so there will be no more estimated bills. You will also have more
information on your electricity usage than is available from current meters.

It is planned to replace the oldest meters with the new smart meters. You can
contact your electricity supplier or ESBN to apply for a prioritised
installation. There is no upfront charge to have a smart meter installed.
