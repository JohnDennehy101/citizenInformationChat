##  Understanding your bill

It can sometimes be difficult to understand the bill, particularly how the
amount you owe is calculated.

Your supplier must include information about how it has calculated your bill.
This includes the meter reading the bill is based on, the tariff category that
applies and any levies that are being applied to the bill.

A bill is usually sent by your electricity supplier every 2 months. It must be
clearly marked whether the meter read used to calculate your bill amount was:

  * A – an actual meter read by ESBN 
  * C – a read submitted by you the customer 
  * E – an estimated meter reading 

Check your bill to make sure you are not getting too many estimated bills in a
row as this could result in a large bill when an actual reading is taken. You
can check your meter and submit your own reading at any time to make sure you
are getting accurate bills.

Suppliers must give you a range of options for paying your bills (for example,
by direct debit, paying online with your card or pay at shops displaying the
Payzone logo). Contact your supplier to find out what option suits you.
