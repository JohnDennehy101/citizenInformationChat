###  Complaints

Prisoners have the right to make a complaint to any prison staff member either
verbally or in writing at any time. Under the [ Irish Prison Service
Complaints System ](http://www.irishprisons.ie/index.php/services-for-
prisoners/prisoner-complaints) there are 6 categories of complaints depending
on the seriousness of the complaint.

The most serious is Category A which covers complaints alleging assault, use
of excessive force, ill treatment, racial abuse, discrimination, intimidation
or threats. Category A complaints are investigated by people from outside the
Prison Service.
