###  Visiting committees

A visiting committee for a prison is an independent statutory watchdog on
behalf of the public to supervise the treatment of prisoners.

While in prison, prisoners have free access to the visiting committees and may
make complaints about how they are being treated to them. Each committee [
makes an annual report ](http://www.justice.ie/en/JELR/Pages/PB15000153) to
the Minister.
