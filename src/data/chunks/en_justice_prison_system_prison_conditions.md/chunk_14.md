##  Vocational training

The Irish Prison Service places a strong emphasis on the provision of
vocational training activities for prisoners. Training activities are chosen
to give as much employment as possible in prison and to enable prisoners to
acquire skills which help them to secure employment on release.

A wide range of training workshops operate within the institutions, including:
printing, computers, braille, woodwork, metalwork, construction, craft and
horticulture. In addition, essential services for the prisons, such as
catering, laundry services and industrial cleaning are provided through work
training.
