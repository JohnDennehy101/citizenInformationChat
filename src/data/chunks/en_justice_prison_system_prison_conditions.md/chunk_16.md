###  Remission

Remission is the complete ending of a sentence at a reduced point.

The vast majority of persons serving sentences are entitled to remission at a
rate of one quarter, providing that they are of good behaviour for the
duration of their sentence. In practice, this means that a person sentenced to
4 yearsâ€™ imprisonment will be expected to serve 3 years in custody. Prisoners
who cannot benefit from remission include those serving life sentences.

The Minister for Justice can grant remission of up to one third where a
prisoner has shown further good conduct by engaging in authorised structured
activities and the Minister is satisfied that, as a result, the prisoner is
less likely to re-offend and will be better able to reintegrate into the
community.
