###  Chaplaincy service

A [ chaplaincy service ](http://www.irishprisons.ie/index.php/chaplaincy) is
available in each prison. Full-time Roman Catholic chaplains are attached to
most prisons and places of detention. Chaplains of other denominations come to
the prisons on a part-time or visiting basis. Local Muslim religious leaders
attend to the needs of Muslim prisoners.

The primary function of the chaplaincy service is to make religious services
available to prisoners and to offer support and assistance in their human and
spiritual development.
