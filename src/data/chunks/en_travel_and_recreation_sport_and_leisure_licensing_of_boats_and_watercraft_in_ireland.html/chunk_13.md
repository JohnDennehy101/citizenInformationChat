###  Inland waterways

You do not need a licence if you are sailing your boat on an inland waterway,
but some waterways require you to be registered and/or to have a permit if
your boat is over a certain size.

[ Waterways Ireland ](https://www.waterwaysireland.org/things-to-do/boating;
/53/boat-registration-and-permits) is responsible for the enforcement of the
rules applying to the waterways under its remit.
