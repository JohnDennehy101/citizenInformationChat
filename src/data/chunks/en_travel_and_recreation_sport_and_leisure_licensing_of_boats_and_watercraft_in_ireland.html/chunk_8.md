###  Safety rules for boats

All boats, regardless of size, must carry lifejackets (or personal flotation
devices) for everyone on board.

All passengers on board a boat or watercraft of less than 23 feet (7 metres)
in length must wear a lifejacket (or personal flotation device).

If your passenger ship is licensed to carry more than 12 people, it must pass
an annual safety inspection carried out by the Department of Transport.
