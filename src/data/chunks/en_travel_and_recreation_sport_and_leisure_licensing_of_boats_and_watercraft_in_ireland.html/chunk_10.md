###  Safety rules for fishing boats

The use of safety equipment on fishing boats is regulated by the [ Fishing
Vessel (Personal Flotation Devices) Regulations, 2001
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2001/en/si/0586.html) as amended by [ S.I.
No. 401 of 2018 ](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2018/si/401/made/en/pdf)
.

Under these regulations, a lifejacket (or personal flotation device) must be
provided for every crew member on any fishing vessel registered and licensed
in Ireland.

The crew members must wear a lifejacket (or personal flotation device) at all
times when on an exposed deck or at all times on open vessels that do not have
internal accommodation. This applies equally whether the boat is at sea, in
harbour or coming to and from moorings.

Each lifejacket (or personal flotation device) should be marked with the
initials "CE". You can get more information on [ lifejackets and personal
