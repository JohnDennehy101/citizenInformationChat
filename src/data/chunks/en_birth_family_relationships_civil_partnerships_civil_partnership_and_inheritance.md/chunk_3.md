##  Rules

If you are not married or in a civil partnership, you may only inherit from
your partner if you are left a bequest in a valid will. However, a civil
partner is entitled to what is called a "legal right share" of their deceased
civil partner's estate even if:

  * There is no will 
  * The will is invalid 
  * There is a valid will, but it leaves little or nothing to the surviving civil partner. 

The civil status of the deceased person may also indirectly affect the
inheritance rights of their children.
