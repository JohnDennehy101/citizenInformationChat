##  Children's inheritance rights

Children have a right to inherit from their biological parents. As the
surviving civil partner's children are not the biological children of the
deceased, they do not have a right to inherit from the deceased civil partner.

Children's inheritance rights may be affected by their deceased parent's civil
status.

The children (minor and adult) are entitled to the entire estate divided
equally between them if:

  * There is no will or the will is invalid, and 
  * The deceased parent is not in a civil partnership or their civil partner is already dead. 

But the children are only entitled to one-third of the estate divided equally
between them if:

  * There is no valid will or the will is invalid, and 
  * The deceased parent is in a civil partnership and is survived by their civil partner. 

Children have no absolute right to inherit their parent's estate if the
deceased parent has made a valid will. However, if a child considers that they
have not been adequately provided for, they may make an application to court.
The child need not be a minor or be dependent to do this. The court has to
decide if the parent has "failed in their moral duty to make proper provision
for the child in accordance with their means".

Each case is decided on its merits and the court looks at the situation from
the point of view of a "prudent and just" parent. If the court orders that
some provision be made for a child or children from the estate of the
deceased, this order can reduce the entitlement of the surviving civil partner
to a legal right share.

Anyone considering challenging a will on these grounds should get legal advice
before applying to the court.
