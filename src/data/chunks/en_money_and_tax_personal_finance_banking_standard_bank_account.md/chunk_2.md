##  Introduction

If you do not have a current account, you can open a type of account called a
basic bank account. A basic bank account is a current account that is free of
charge for everyday banking for at least the first year.

You can open a basic bank account with one of the main Irish banks if you are
resident in the EU and you do not already have another payment or current
account in Ireland.
