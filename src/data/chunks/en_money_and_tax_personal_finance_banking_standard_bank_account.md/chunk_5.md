##  How can I get a basic bank account?

To get a basic bank account, you must:

  * Be at least 16 years of age (or at least 18 for PTSB) 
  * Be legally resident in the EU 
  * Not have another current account with a bank in Ireland 

To open an account contact the bank of your choice. The following basic bank
accounts are available:

**Bank** |  **Account name**  
---|---  
AIB  |  Basic Bank Account   
PTSB  |  Basic Payment Account   
Bank of Ireland  |  Basic Bank Account   
  
The EBS Money Manager account is similar to a basic bank account but you can
open it if you have another bank account. It does not have fees for everyday
banking and does not provide overdrafts or chequebooks.
