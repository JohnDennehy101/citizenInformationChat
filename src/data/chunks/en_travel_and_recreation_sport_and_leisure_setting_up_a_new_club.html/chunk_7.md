###  Club officials

A club needs a number of officials to run the club. The minimum requirement
is:

  * Chairperson 
  * Secretary 
  * Treasurer 

These are elected posts and the holders are members of the club committee.
There can be other members on the committee as laid out in the clubâ€™s
constitution, for example, a Fundraising Officer. A club can also have other
roles outside of the formal club positions and club members may volunteer to
carry out these roles.
