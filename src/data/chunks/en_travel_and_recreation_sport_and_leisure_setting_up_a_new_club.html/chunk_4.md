###  Club structure

One of the first things you will have to decide is what legal structure to use
for the club. The most common and simplest structure for a club is an
_unincorporated association_ . This is the structure we cover in this page.

It involves drawing up a set of rules to regulate the relationship between the
members of the club. This is known as the clubâ€™s constitution. It also usually
provides for a committee to run the club's affairs. Under this structure, the
club has no separate legal personality, and the club members are personally
liable for the actions or debts of the club. If the club wants to employ staff
or lease property, it may find that an unincorporated association is too
limited a structure for this.

Sport Ireland provides information on the various types of legal structures,
along with the advantages and disadvantages of each type, in the [ NGB Support
Kit ](https://www.sportireland.ie/news/better-boards-stronger-sport-toolkit)
on its website.

You may wish to register the club as a charity. You can find out more
information in our page [ What is a charity? ](/en/government-in-
ireland/charities/what-is-a-charity/) Also see 'More information' below for
details on setting up a charity.
