##  Insurance

As an unincorporated association, the club members are personally liable for
the actions or debts of the club. Therefore, the club should get adequate
insurance to cover its members. It should have suitable public liability
insurance and professional indemnity insurance for its activities. You may be
able to get insurance advice from the clubâ€™s national governing body, if there
is one.
