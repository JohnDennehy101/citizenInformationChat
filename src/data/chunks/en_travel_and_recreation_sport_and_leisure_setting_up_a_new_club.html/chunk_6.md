###  Club constitution

The club constitution is a written document that states the rules and
structures that govern the club. It outlines the functions of the club and the
procedures for membership, meetings, and committees. A club constitution is
usually required for funding and if applying for tax relief.

If there is a national governing body, it may be able to provide you with a
model constitution which you could adapt. Sports clubs often have copies of
their constitutions on their websites. You can find [ guidance on
