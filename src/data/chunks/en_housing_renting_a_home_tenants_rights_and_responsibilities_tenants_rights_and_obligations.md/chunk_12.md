##  How to resolve a dispute with your landlord

If you feel your rights as a tenant have been broken, you have a number of
ways to correct this. Our page on [ resolving disputes between landlords and
tenants ](/en/housing/renting-a-home/resolving-disputes/disputes-between-
landlords-and-tenants/) describes several options. These include taking your
case to the [ Residential Tenancies Board ](/en/housing/renting-a-
home/resolving-disputes/residential-tenancies-board/) , which provides a
dispute resolution service for private, AHB and student-specific tenancies. Or
contacting the [ RTBâ€™s investigations and sanctions unit
](https://www.rtb.ie/registration-and-compliance/investigations-sanctions) to
make a complaint about a landlord breaking residential tenancies legislation.

[ Threshold ](https://www.threshold.ie/advice/) provides a [ free advice
](https://threshold.ie/faq/) and information service to tenants.

If your landlord is not maintaining the property to the [ proper standards
](/en/housing/renting-a-home/tenants-rights-and-responsibilities/minimum-
standards-for-rented-homes/) you can contact your [ local authority
](http://www.housing.gov.ie/local-government/administration/local-
authorities/local-authorities) , which is responsible for enforcing standards
in rented housing.
