##  Documents you need

If the Department of Social Protection needs more information to decide
whether you are habitually resident in the Republic of Ireland you may be
asked to fill out the [ HRC1 form (pdf)
](https://assets.gov.ie/27484/305a54e8a062459ab0b394e8f2031ce9.pdf) .

Regardless of what country you are coming from you may be asked to provide
documentary evidence that shows your 'centre of interest' is now in Ireland.
This evidence should show that you have moved to Ireland, you intend to settle
in Ireland permanently and you do not intend to go back to live in the country
you came from.

Where possible, you should provide the following documentary evidence:

  * Proof to show you have given up accommodation abroad 
  * Proof that you have cancelled or applied to cancel any non-transferable benefits 
  * Proof you have transferred or applied to transfer any transferable income 
  * Proof to show measures you have put in place to open a bank account here 
  * Proof to show you have a tenancy in your own name (in Ireland) 
  * Proof of travel documents including, where relevant, excess baggage fees and removal/shipping receipts 

All evidence presented will be authenticated, as far as is possible, by the
relevant Officer. In some cases you may be asked to submit further documentary
evidence. In certain cases, a Social Welfare Inspector may investigate your
application.
