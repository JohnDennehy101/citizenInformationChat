##  Introduction

The social welfare system in Ireland is divided into three main types of
payments. These are:

  * Social insurance payments: (for example, [ Jobseeker's Benefit ](/en/social-welfare/unemployed-people/jobseekers-benefit/) ) 
  * Means-tested payments or social assistance payments: (for example, [ Jobseeker's Allowance ](/en/social-welfare/unemployed-people/jobseekers-allowance/) ) 
  * Universal payments: (for example, [ Child Benefit ](/en/social-welfare/families-and-children/child-benefit/) ) 

With all social welfare payments in Ireland, you must satisfy the rules for
each scheme to qualify. You must also be _habitually resident_ in Ireland to
qualify for the following payments:
