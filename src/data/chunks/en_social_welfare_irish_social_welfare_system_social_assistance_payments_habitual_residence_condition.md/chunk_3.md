###  UK citizens

Residence in the [ Common Travel Area ](/en/government-in-ireland/ireland-and-
the-uk/common-travel-area-between-ireland-and-the-uk/) is treated the same way
as residence in Ireland for the purposes of the habitual residence condition
(HRC). However, UK citizens who have recently moved to Ireland may find it
more difficult to establish that their main centre of interest is in Ireland.
