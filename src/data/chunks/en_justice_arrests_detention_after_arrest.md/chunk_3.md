##  Detention before being charged

If you are arrested for an offence which does not allow for your detention,
then you must be charged with that offence and brought before a judge of the
District Court as soon as possible. If you are arrested after 5pm on any
evening and the [ District Court ](/en/justice/courts-system/district-court/)
is sitting before noon the following day, it is acceptable to bring you before
the District Court at the beginning of that sitting.

If, on the other hand, you are arrested for an offence which allows for your
detention in a Garda station to assist with a Garda investigation, then you
will normally be detained for the period allowed by law.

The main pieces of legislation that govern detention after arrest are:

  * Section 4 of the [ Criminal Justice Act 1984 ](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1984/en/act/pub/0022/index.html)
  * Section 42 of the [ Criminal Justice Act 1999 ](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1999/en/act/pub/0010/index.html)
  * Section 30 of the [ Offences Against the State Act 1939 ](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1939/en/act/pub/0013/index.html)
  * Section 2 of the [ Criminal Justice (Drug Trafficking) Act 1996 ](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1996/en/act/pub/0029/index.html)
  * Section 50 of the [ Criminal Justice Act 2007 ](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2007/en/act/pub/0029/index.html)
  * Sections 16 and 17 of the [ Criminal Procedure Act 2010 ](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2010/en/act/pub/0027/index.html)

These pieces of legislation recognise the concept of detention after arrest by
the Gardaí to assist with their investigations. The Gardaí must have
reasonable grounds for believing your detention is necessary to properly
investigate the offence.

See "Further information" below on the offences to which detention applies.
