###  Can children be detained?

Apart from detention under Section 30, the detention of suspects who are under
12 years of age is not allowed. If, however, the member in charge of the Garda
station has reasonable grounds for believing that the suspect is not below the
age of 12 years, this prohibition does not apply. It will be necessary for the
member in charge to justify these grounds if it transpires subsequently that
the suspect was in fact under 12 years of age. [ More information on the
treatment of children in Garda custody is available here
