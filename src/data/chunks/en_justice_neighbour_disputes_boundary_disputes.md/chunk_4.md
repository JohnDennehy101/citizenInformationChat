##  Carrying out works to a party structure

You should always get your neighbour’s consent before carrying out works to a
party structure. If you carry out works without your neighbour’s permission,
your neighbour could take a claim for trespass and nuisance.

You must pay your neighbour’s reasonable costs for getting professional advice
to assess the likely consequences of the work. You must also pay reasonable
compensation for the inconvenience caused by the works and reimburse your
neighbour for any damage done to their property.

You are entitled to take into account your neighbour’s use and enjoyment of
the party structure when assessing the compensation they are due. If you fail
to compensate your neighbour, they can apply to the District Court for an
order to compel you to make good any damage, or to pay them for the costs and
expenses.

Works include any of the following:

  * Adjustment, alteration, cutting into or away, decoration, demolition, improvement, lowering, maintenance, raising, renewal, repair, replacement, strengthening or taking down 
  * Finding out the course of cables, drains, pipes, sewers, wires or other conduits and clearing, renewing, repairing or replacing them 
  * Cutting, treating or replacing any hedge, tree or shrub 
  * Clearing or filling in ditches 
  * Carrying out inspections, drawing up plans and performing other tasks required for, incidental to, or consequential on any of the works above 

You are entitled to carry out works on a party structure in the following
circumstances:

  * Works that are required in order to comply with any statutory provision, for example, the requirements of the Building Regulations 
  * Exempted developments under the Planning Acts (developments for which planning permission is not needed), or developments for which you have planning permission or which are required in order to comply with the conditions of a planning permission 
  * Works required for the preservation of the party structure or of any building or unbuilt-on land of which it forms a part 
  * Any other works that will not cause substantial damage or inconvenience to your neighbour, or that even if they will cause damage or inconvenience, it is nevertheless reasonable to carry them out 

You should be careful not to leave a party structure in a dangerous condition
as a result of your actions.
