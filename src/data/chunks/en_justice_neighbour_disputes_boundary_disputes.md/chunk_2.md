##  Who owns the boundary between your property and your neighbour's?

The general rule is that any boundaries between your land and your neighbour’s
land are jointly owned by both you and your neighbour. But you may be able to
prove that you own a boundary structure outright. Even if you can show that
you have outright ownership of a boundary structure, your neighbour may have
certain rights over that structure.

If you do not know where the precise boundary between your property and your
neighbour’s property is, or how the boundary is owned, you should start by
investigating your title. Your title documents are the [ deeds and related
papers ](/en/housing/owning-a-home/buying-a-home/property-deeds/) that
describe your land. Your property may be registered in the Land Registry. You
should get legal advice if there is a dispute about the ownership of any part
of your property or land.
