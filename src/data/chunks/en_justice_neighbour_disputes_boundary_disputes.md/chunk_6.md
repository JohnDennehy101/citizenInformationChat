##  Trees and hedges

A tree or hedge on a boundary is generally the property of both landowners.
You are not allowed to cut down the tree or hedge without your neighbourâ€™s
permission. Overhanging branches or roots that are encroaching on your land
can be cut back without permission, but only as far as the boundary line. You
should still discuss this with your neighbour to avoid disagreements.

You should make sure that the tree is not the subject of a tree preservation
order. Tree preservation orders are made by the local authority. You should
check with the local authority before cutting back or taking any action
against a tree that is subject to a tree preservation order.
