###  Equal access to websites throughout the EU

Under rules on geo-blocking, you have the right to equal access to the digital
market throughout the EU regardless of where you are living.

The [ Geo-blocking Regulation (EU Regulation 2018/302) (pdf) ](https://eur-
lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32018R0302&from=EN) has
applied across the EU since December 2018 and aims to stop the practices of
geo-blocking and geo-discrimination.

As a result of the Geo-blocking Regulation, businesses within the EU are not
allowed to:

  * Restrict your access to a website that was intended for consumers within a particular geographic area 
  * Force you to buy from a particular website intended for that country or group of countries alone 
  * Limit you to a particular website, even if you consent to being redirected to that website 
  * Automatically redirect you to another website set up for that location 
  * Treat payment methods differently based on your location 

‘Geo-discrimination’ can also happen off-line. For example, if you are
physically present in a trader’s premises and you are prevented from buying a
product or offered different conditions, such as higher price, because of your
nationality or place of residence.
