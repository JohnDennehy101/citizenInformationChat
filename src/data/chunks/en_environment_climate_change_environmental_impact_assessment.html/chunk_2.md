##  Introduction

The environmental impact of certain projects, plans and programmes must be
assessed before they can go ahead. EU legislation requires that EU member
states complete an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIR) or a Strategic
Environmental Assessment (SEA) for certain projects, plans and programmes. An
EIA is used to identify the environmental and social impacts of a proposed
project before a decision is made about the project. An SEA is used to assess
the environmental effect of a plan at public policy and planning levels.
