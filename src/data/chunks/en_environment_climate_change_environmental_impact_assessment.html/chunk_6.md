##  What is a Strategic Environmental Assessment?

Public plans and programmes that are likely to have significant effects on the
environment must have a Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA). The SEA
ensures that these plans and programmes are assessed for their environmental
effect before they are adopted. The SEA Directive applies to a number of
sectors including:

  * Agriculture 
  * Forestry 
  * Fisheries 
  * Energy 
  * Industry 
  * Transport 
  * Waste management 
  * Water management 
  * Telecommunications 
  * Tourism 
  * Land use planning 

The SEA Directive (2001/42/EC) is implemented in Ireland by the [ European
Communities (Environmental Assessment of Certain Plans and Programmes)
Regulations 2004 ](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2004/en/si/0435.html) (SI
435/2004) and the [ Planning and Development (Strategic Environmental
Assessment) Regulations 2004
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2004/en/si/0436.html) (SI 436/ 2004) as
amended by SI 200/2011 and SI 201/2011.

This legislation implements the following aspects of the SEA Directive:

  * The review, preparation and variation of a development plan 
  * The preparation or amendment of a local area plan 
  * The review or making of regional planning guidelines 
  * The making of a planning scheme in respect of part or all of a Strategic Development Zone (SDZ). 

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) must be consulted on all plans and
programmes that need an SEA, and at each stage of the SEA process. The EPA has
published [ SEA resource and guidance documents
](https://www.epa.ie/monitoringassessment/assessment/sea/process/) , as well
as detailed information about the [ SEA process
](https://www.epa.ie/monitoringassessment/assessment/sea/process/) .
