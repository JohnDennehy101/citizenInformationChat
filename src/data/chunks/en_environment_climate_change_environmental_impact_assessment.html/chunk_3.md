##  What is an Environmental Impact Assessment?

EU member states must carry out assessments of the environmental impact of
certain public and private projects before they are allowed to progress. The
Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) process ensures that projects that are
likely to have a significant effect on the environment, are assessed in
advance, so that people are aware of what those effects are likely to be. The
assessment **must** be carried out for certain projects including:

  * Motorways 
  * Large scale developments in agriculture 
  * Food industry developments 
  * Chemical industry developments 
  * Infrastructure and urban development 

The full list of projects that need an EIA are listed in Annex I of the [
Environmental Impact Assessment Directive
](https://ec.europa.eu/environment/eia/pdf/EIA_Directive_informal.pdf) , as
amended. Each Member State decides on a case-by-case basis, whether Annex II
projects need an EIA. The Environmental Impact Assessment Directive [ has been
amended and revised a number of times
](https://ec.europa.eu/environment/eia/eia-legalcontext.htm) to bring it in
line with subsequent European environmental policy. This EU legislation was
implemented in Ireland by the Planning and Development Acts 2000-2020, as well
as a number of Planning and Development Regulations and European Communities
(Environmental Impact Assessment) Regulations.
