You may use [ hospital services as an out-patient or an in-patient

introduction/) .

**Out-patient services**

You may be referred by your family doctor (GP) to the out-patient department
of a public hospital - for example, to be seen by a specialist consultant or
for diagnostic tests like x-rays.

Accident and emergency services are outpatient services and if you are
referred by a GP there is no charge. If you visit an accident and emergency
department without being referred by a GP there is a set charge.

To visit a consultant (medical specialist) you must be referred by a GP. As a
public patient, you do not have to pay for the consultant’s services and you
do not get to choose your consultant. In many areas, there are waiting lists
for non-emergency services.

If you choose to be referred to a consultant as a private patient, you pay for
the consultant’s services. Private hospitals set their own charges. If you
have [ private health insurance ](/en/health/health-system/private-health-
insurance/) , it may cover some or all of the charges.

**In-patient services**

You may be admitted to hospital as an in-patient under the care of a
consultant.

If you are in a public hospital as a public patient, and you do not have a
medical card, there is a set daily in-patient charge. There is maximum limit
to how much you will be charged over a 12-month period.

If you are admitted to a public hospital as a private patient of a consultant,
you pay a different daily in-patient hospital charge.
