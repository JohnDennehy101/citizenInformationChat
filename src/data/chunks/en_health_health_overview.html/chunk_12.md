##  How to make a complaint about a healthcare provider

There is a [ complaints system for public health services ](/en/health/health-
system/making-a-complaint-about-the-health-service-executive/) that are
provided by or on behalf of the HSE.

If you are making a complaint about a private health service, you can complain
directly to the private service provider or contact the regulating body. You
do not have the option of complaining to the HSE or to the Ombudsman or the
Ombudsman for Children.
