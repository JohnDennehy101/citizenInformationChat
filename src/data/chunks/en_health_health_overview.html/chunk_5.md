###  Medical card

If your income is below a certain level you may get a [ medical card
](/en/health/medical-cards-and-gp-visit-cards/medical-card/) (Some people can
get a card without an income test, for example, people who are entitled to a
card under EU regulations).

With a medical card you can get public health services free of charge,
including [ doctor visits ](/en/health/health-services/gp-and-hospital-
services/gp-services-to-medical-card-holders/) and [ public hospital services
](/en/health/health-services/gp-and-hospital-services/hospital-services-
introduction/) .

The medical card covers the cost of prescription medicines but you pay a set
charge when you get the medicines â€“ this [ prescription charge
](/en/health/drugs-and-medicines/prescription-charges-for-medical-card-
holders/) is the same for each item.
