###  What do I need to register to vote?

To register, you will need to provide:

  * Your name 
  * Your date of birth 
  * Your PPS number 
  * An address - when you register, you can state that you have ‘no fixed address’. But you will need to tell your local authority the area where you live and spend most of your time. This will affect where you vote. 

If you are in [ Dublin and want to register online ](https://www.voter.ie/) ,
you will need to provide an address or Eircode – see ‘How to get an address
for voting’ below.
