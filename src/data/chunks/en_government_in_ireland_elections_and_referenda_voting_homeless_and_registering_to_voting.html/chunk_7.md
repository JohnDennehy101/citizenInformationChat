##  How to get your polling card

You do not need a polling card to vote.

You need to [ bring ID to vote
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/government-in-ireland/elections-and-
referenda/voting/voting-procedure-in-a-general-election/#35fb3c) **even if**
you have a polling card.

If you have no address where you can receive post, your local authority will
contact you to arrange for you to collect your polling card at one of their
offices.

If you used an address or Eircode to register then your polling card will be
sent to that address.

If you did not get a polling card, you can find your polling station on your [
local authorityâ€™s website ](https://www.housing.gov.ie/local-
government/administration/local-authorities/local-authorities) .
