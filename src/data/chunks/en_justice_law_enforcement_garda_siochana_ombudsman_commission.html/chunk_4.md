##  Who can make a complaint?

Anyone can make a complaint to the Garda Ombudsman about the behaviour of a
Garda.

However, you must have either:

  * Witnessed the incident in question 
  * Been directly affected by the incident 

You can make a complaint on behalf of someone else if:

  * They have signed a [ consent form (pdf) ](https://gardaombudsman.ie/app/uploads/2017/05/gsoc-consent-form-2017.pdf)
  * They cannot give consent due to incapacity or age (you will need to provide other documents which explain this)
