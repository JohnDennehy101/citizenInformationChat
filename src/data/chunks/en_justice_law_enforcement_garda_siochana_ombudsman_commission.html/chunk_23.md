####  **Non-criminal investigation**

If the Garda Ombudsman or Garda investigation finds that there may have been a
breach of discipline, this is reported to the Gardaí who review the complaint
and decide if a breach has occurred.

If there has been a breach, the Gardaí can impose a sanction, or set up a
Board of Inquiry to recommend a sanction if the breach is more serious.

The range of sanctions vary and can include:

  * Advising the Garda on what they should have done in the situation 
  * A reduction in pay 
  * Dismissal of the Garda, in very serious circumstances 

It is important to note that the Garda Ombudsman cannot decide that a breach
of discipline has occurred, and so has no powers to impose penalties or
sanctions itself.
