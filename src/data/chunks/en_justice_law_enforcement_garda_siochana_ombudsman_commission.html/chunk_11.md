###  **How do I know if my case is admissible?**

To be admissible, a complaint must be:

  * Made by someone who is entitled to complain 
  * About conduct by a Garda that could be considered misbehaviour 
  * Made within the acceptable time limit 

A complaint is not considered admissible if it is false or misleading. You
will be informed by writing if your complaint is not admissible and the
reasons why. If your complaint is not admissible, no further action will be
taken.

You can read more about how the Garda Ombudsman [ decides if they can deal
with complaints ](https://www.gardaombudsman.ie/make-a-complaint/before-you-
complain/) .
