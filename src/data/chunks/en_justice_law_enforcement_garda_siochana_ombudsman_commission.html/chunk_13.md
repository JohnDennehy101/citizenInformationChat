###  **Informal resolution or mediation**

Depending on the complaint, you and the Garda may be offered informal
resolution or mediation. Both parties must agree in writing for the complaint
to be dealt with this way.

Once written consent is received, a case officer who has been trained in
mediation will call both you and the Garda separately to discuss the
complaint. You will not need to meet the Garda or case officer face-to-face.

All information shared during mediation or informal resolution is
confidential. It cannot be used in civil or criminal proceedings, including
disciplinary procedures.
