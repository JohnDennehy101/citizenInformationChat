###  **Complaints from children**

It is generally expected that a parent, guardian, or responsible adult would
make a complaint on behalf of a child or young person.

However, no lower age limit applies, so children can make complaints
themselves. A child can make an appointment to verbally give their complaint
in person at the Garda Ombudsman’s office.

You can read the Garda Ombudsman’s [ child safeguarding statement
](https://www.gardaombudsman.ie/make-a-complaint/before-you-complain/how-we-
deal-with-complaints/child-safeguarding-statement/) which explains how they
protect children who use their service.
