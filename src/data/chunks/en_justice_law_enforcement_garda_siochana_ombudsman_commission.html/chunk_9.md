##  How does the complaints process work?

On receiving your complaint, the Garda Ombudsman must decide whether your
complaint is admissible and should either be referred for informal resolution
or investigated.

However, before deciding whether your complaint is admissible, the Garda
Ombudsman may seek your consent to have the complaint resolved through local
intervention.
