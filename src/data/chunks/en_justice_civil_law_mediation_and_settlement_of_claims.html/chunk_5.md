##  Lodgements

If an offer is made in settlement of your claim and you refuse that offer, the
defendant may _lodge_ that amount in court.

If at the end of the case the judge awards an amount that is less than the
lodgement, you will generally be obliged to pay all of the legal costs of both
sides since the date of the lodgement.
