##  Mediation

Before you can begin legal proceedings in a court, your solicitor must advise
you to consider mediation as possible means of resolving the underlying
dispute involving an independent mediator. The solicitor will also set out the
advantages of mediation and discuss its suitability for the dispute at hand.
Solicitors are also obliged to provide details of possible mediators. Whether
or not you decide to enter into mediation with the other side is your own
choice.

Parties may also agree to enter mediation at any stage after legal proceedings
have begun.

A court may also suggest that the matter may be better resolved through
mediation. If such a recommendation is made by a court, any failure to explore
mediation may be reflected in the costs order made by the court at the
conclusion of the proceedings.
