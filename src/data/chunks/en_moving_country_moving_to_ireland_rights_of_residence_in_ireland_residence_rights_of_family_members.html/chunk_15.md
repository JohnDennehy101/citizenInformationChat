###  Employment permit holders and Stamp 4 holders

If you have an [ employment permit ](/en/moving-country/working-in-
ireland/employment-permits/overview-employment-permits/) (other than a
Critical Skills Employment Permit) or a Stamp 4, then your family can apply to
join you in Ireland after 12 months. The [ policy of Immigration Service
Delivery (ISD) (pdf) ](http://www.inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/Family Reunification
Policy Document.pdf/Files/Family Reunification Policy Document.pdf) is to
assess each application on its own merits, and you do not have a right to be
joined by your family.

You should have enough income to support your family. If your spouse or
partner wants to join you in Ireland, you should have earned at least â‚¬30,000
per year in the 2 years before the application.

For children, the amount you should earn is based on the weekly [ Working
Family Payment income limits ](/en/social-welfare/social-welfare-
payments/social-welfare-payments-to-families-and-children/family-income-
supplement#l2b73a) for your family size.
