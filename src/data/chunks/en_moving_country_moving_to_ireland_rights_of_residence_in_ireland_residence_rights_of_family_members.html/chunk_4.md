###  Spouses from outside the EEA, UK and Switzerland

If you are [ returning to Ireland with your spouse ](/en/returning-to-
ireland/residency-and-citizenship/returning-to-ireland-with-your-non-eea-
spouse/) , they may [ need an entry visa ](/en/moving-country/visas-for-
ireland/visa-requirements-for-entering-ireland/) . They should apply for a
long stay (D) visa. Your income in the 3 years before the application should
be more than â‚¬40,000 in total, not including any social welfare payments you
received during that period.

After they arrive on a long stay visa, or if they are from a country that
allows them to travel to Ireland without a visa, you should both go to your
immigration registration office to apply for [ permission to reside
](/en/moving-country/moving-to-ireland/rights-of-residence-in-
ireland/registration-of-non-eea-nationals-in-ireland/) in Ireland.

If your spouse is already resident in Ireland (for example, if they have a
student visa), they should make an appointment to go to their immigration
registration office to apply for residence as the spouse of an Irish citizen.

But if your spouse lives in Ireland but does not have permission to live here,
they must make an application by [ filling in a form
](https://www.irishimmigration.ie/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Application-for-
permission-to-remain-in-the-State-on-the-basis-of-marriage-civil-
partnership.pdf) and sending supporting documents to Immigration Service
Delivery (ISD). This also applies if your spouse is an international
protection applicant.
