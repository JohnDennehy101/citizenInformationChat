##  How do I make an observation on an application?

You can make an observation on applications for planning permission for
strategic infrastructure developments. You can do this [ online
](https://online.pleanala.ie/en-ie/sid/observation) or in writing.

If you are making an observation in writing, you can post or deliver it to An
Bord Pleanála. If you are delivering the observation in person, you should
give it to a member of staff at An Bord Pleanála. Do not leave your
observation in the letterbox, or email it, as these observations will be
invalid.

An Bord Pleanála has an [ observation form (docx)
