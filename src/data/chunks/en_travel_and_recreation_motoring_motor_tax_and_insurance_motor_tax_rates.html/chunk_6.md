###  Apply in-person

If you are applying to your local motor tax office in-person, you will need
the appropriate form and fee.

If you are **applying for motor tax for the first time** , you need a 'First
Motor Tax Application' Form RF100. This is available from the motor dealer or
the person you bought your vehicle from.

If you are **renewing your motor tax where there is no change in owner or
vehicle details** , two forms are available to renew your motor tax:

  * [ Motor Tax Renewal Form RF100A (pdf) ](https://www.motortax.ie/OMT/pdf/RF100A_en.pdf)
  * Motor Tax Renewal Form RF100B. 

The RF100A is available from:

  * Motor tax offices 
  * Public libraries 
  * Garda stations. 

The only difference between these two forms is that the RF100B is a computer-
printed form. It is automatically posted to you about a month before your tax
is due to expire.

Not everyone receives a form in the post, so it is up to you to keep a check
on when your tax expires. Return your completed form to your local motor tax
office in person or by post.

If you apply in person, you will receive your new tax disc at that time.

If you make a postal application, allow up to 3 weeks to receive your new
disc.

The appropriate fee must be submitted with your renewal form. A certificate of
approval from Revenue for a disabled driver or passenger is also required if
the vehicle is exempted from motor tax.
