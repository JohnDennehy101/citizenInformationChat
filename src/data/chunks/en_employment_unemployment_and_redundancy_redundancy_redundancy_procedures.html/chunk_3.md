##  Methods of selection

If a method for deciding redundancies has been agreed with a trade union, your
employer should follow it.

It is up to your employer which selection criteria they use, as long as they
can show that they are fair and reasonable.

The most commonly used selection methods are:

  * The ‘last in, first out’ method, where the newest member of staff is the first one to go 
  * Asking if employees want to volunteer for redundancy, known as _voluntary redundancy_
  * A points system, where all employees doing the same job are ranked by objective criteria (could include attendance record, standard of work, skills and qualifications).
