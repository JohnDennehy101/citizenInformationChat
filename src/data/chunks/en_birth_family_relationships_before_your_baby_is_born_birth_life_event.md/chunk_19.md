##  Childcare

There is a wide range of [ childcare options, ](/en/education/pre-school-
education-and-childcare/your-childcare-options/) including crèches,
childminders, and playgroups. Your choice will depend on what your needs are
and what is available to you.

The [ Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) Scheme ](/en/education/pre-
school-education-and-childcare/early-childhood-care-and-education-scheme/)
provides free early childhood care and education for children of pre-school
age during the school year.

The [ National Childcare Scheme (NCS) ](/en/education/pre-school-education-
and-childcare/national-childcare-scheme/) gives financial support towards the
cost of childcare for hours spent outside of pre-school. Children must be
attending a childcare provider (including childminders and school-age
childcare services) registered with [ Tusla – the Child and Family Agency
](/en/birth-family-relationships/services-and-supports-for-children/tusla-the-
child-and-family-agency/) .

The scheme provides 2 types of childcare subsidy for children aged over 6
months (24 weeks) and up to 15 years old:

  * A [ universal subsidy ](/en/education/pre-school-education-and-childcare/universal-childcare-subsidy/) which is not means tested. The subsidy is deducted from the overall bill that you receive from your childcare service. 
  * An income-assessed subsidy which is means tested. 

The Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth has
published information on the supports available at the different stages [ your
