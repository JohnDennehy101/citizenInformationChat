you and arrange tests if necessary. There are a [ wide range of fertility
treatments ](/en/birth-family-relationships/before-your-baby-is-
born/fertility-treatments-and-dahr/) available to help you become a parent.
From 25 September 2023, you can get free assisted conception treatment from a
HSE-approved private clinic of your choice. Read more about [ getting IVF and
other specialist treatment through the HSE ](https://www2.hse.ie/pregnancy-
birth/trying-for-a-baby/your-fertility/using-fertility-services/) .

Some people choose [ surrogacy ](/en/birth-family-relationships/adoption-and-
fostering/surrogacy/) to help them become a parent. Surrogacy is when a woman
carries and gives birth to a baby for another person or couple.
