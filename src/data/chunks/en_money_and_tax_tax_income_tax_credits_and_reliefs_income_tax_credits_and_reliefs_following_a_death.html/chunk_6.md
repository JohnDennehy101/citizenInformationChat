###  Joint assessment

If a married couple is jointly assessed for tax, the spouse or civil partner
responsible for making tax returns is known as the _assessable spouse_ or
_nominated civil partner_ .

You can decide which of you is to be the assessable spouse or nominated civil
partner. If no one has been nominated, the assessable person is the spouse or
civil partner with the higher income and remains the assessable spouse or
nominated civil partner until you change this.
