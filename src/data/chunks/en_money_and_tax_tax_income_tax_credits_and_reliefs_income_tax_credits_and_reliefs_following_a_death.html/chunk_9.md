###  Separate assessment

If you and your spouse or civil partner were taxed under separate assessment,
the Widowed Person's or Surviving Civil Partner's Tax Credit will replace your
personal tax credit. You may also be entitled to unused tax credits that were
allocated to your spouse or civil partner.
