##  Tax in the year of death if you are not married or in a civil partnership

In the year of your death, your normal tax credits for the whole of that year
apply. If a refund of tax is due, it can be claimed by the person responsible
for finalising your financial affairs.

[ Unmarried couples ](/en/birth-family-relationships/cohabiting-couples/) are
treated as single for tax purposes.
