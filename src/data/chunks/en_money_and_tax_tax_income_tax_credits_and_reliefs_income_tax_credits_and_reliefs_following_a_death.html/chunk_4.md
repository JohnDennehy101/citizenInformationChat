##  Tax in the year of death if you are married or in a civil partnership

If your spouse or civil partner dies, the way you are taxed in that year
depends on how you were taxed as a couple. You may have been taxed through
single assessment, separate assessment or joint assessment. There is more
information on these options in [ taxation of married people and civil
partners ](/en/money-and-tax/tax/income-tax/taxation-of-married-people/) .
