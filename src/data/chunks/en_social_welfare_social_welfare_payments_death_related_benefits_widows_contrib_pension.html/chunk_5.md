###  Contributions paid in other EU member states

If you were previously insurably employed in a country covered by EU
Regulations or in a country with which Ireland has a bilateral social security
agreement and you have paid at least one full rate PRSI contribution in
Ireland, you may combine your insurance record in that country with your Irish
PRSI contributions to help you qualify for Widow's, Widower's or Surviving
Civil Partner's (Contributory) Pension.

More information is available in our document about [ combining your social
insurance contributions from abroad ](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-
system/claiming-a-social-welfare-payment/social-insurance-contributions-from-
abroad/) .
