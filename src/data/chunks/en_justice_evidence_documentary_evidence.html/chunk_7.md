##  Documentary evidence in civil cases

Documentary evidence can also be used as evidence in civil proceedings.
Traditionally, though, a witness familiar with the document has to attend
court or [ swear an affidavit ](/en/justice/witnesses/affidavit/) for the
document to be used.

Part 3 of the [ Civil Law and Criminal Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2020
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2020/act/13/enacted/en/pdf) sets out new
rules on how most business records can be used as evidence in civil
proceedings without a witness familiar with the document attending court or
swearing an affidavit.

Business records include records compiled in the course of any trade,
profession of occupation or by charities, State bodies or international
organisations.
