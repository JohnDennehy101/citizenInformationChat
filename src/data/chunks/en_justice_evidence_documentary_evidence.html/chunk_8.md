###  Procedure

To be used, a copy of the business record must be given to all parties within
21 days of the start of hearing along with a notice of intention to give the
information in evidence.

If a party wishes to object to the use of the document in this manner, that
objection must be made within 7 days of the start of the hearing. A court
waive or shorten these timelines.

If an objection is made, the court will then decide whether to allow or
exclude the business record without an appropriate person attending to verify
the record. The factors which a court must consider in deciding what is in the
interests of justice include:

  * Whether the information is sufficiently reliable based on its content, source and the manner in which it was compiled 
  * The potential unfairness to the other party and its ability to challenge the information if an appropriate person does not attend court 
  * Any other circumstances affecting the accuracy of the information in the document 

A court can also allow a copy of that document to be used rather than the
original.
