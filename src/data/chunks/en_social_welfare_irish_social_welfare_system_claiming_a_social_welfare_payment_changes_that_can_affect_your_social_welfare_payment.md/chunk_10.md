##  Further information

In some cases, if you qualify for more than one payment you will have to
choose the one that is of most benefit to you. For example, though you may
qualify for Illness Benefit it may be of greater benefit for you to claim
Disability Allowance because of the additional benefits, such as Fuel
Allowance, the Living Alone Increase and the Household Benefits Package. You
can get help and advice on which social welfare payment you qualify for and
which is of most benefit to you from your [ Intreo centre or social welfare
local office ](https://www.gov.ie/en/directory/category/e1f4b5-intreo-
offices/) and your [ local Citizens Information Service
](http://centres.citizensinformation.ie/) .
