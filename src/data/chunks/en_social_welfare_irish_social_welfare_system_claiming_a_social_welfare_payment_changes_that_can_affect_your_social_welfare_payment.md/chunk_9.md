###  Changes automatically made to your social welfare payment

In some cases, the Department of Social Protection will automatically change
your social welfare payment to reflect changes in your personal circumstances.
For example, if you are getting a social welfare payment, you will
automatically get an increase in your payment when you are 80 years of age.
However, in most cases you must contact the Department of Social Protection
when your circumstances change.
