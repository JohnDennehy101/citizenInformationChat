###  Changes meaning you qualify for additional social welfare payments

A change in your personal circumstances may mean you qualify for an additional
social welfare payment. For example, if you are getting a One-Parent Family
Payment and get a job for at least 19 hours a week, you may be able to claim [
Working Family Payment (WFP) ](/en/social-welfare/families-and-
children/working-family-payment/) .
