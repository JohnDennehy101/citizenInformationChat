##  Data protection and cybersecurity when working from home

The Data Protection Commission has given guidance on protecting personal data
when working remotely.

Both employers and employees should ensure that:

  * Any device used has the necessary updates, such as operating system, software and antivirus updates 
  * Any device is used in a safe location, and that nobody else can view the screen, particularly if working with sensitive personal data 
  * Devices are locked if they are left unattended for any reason and stored carefully when not in use 
  * Effective access controls, such as strong passwords, and, where available, encryption are used to restrict access to the device, and to reduce the risk if a device is stolen or lost 
  * Work email accounts rather than personal ones are used for work-related emails involving personal data. If a personal email has to be used, any contents and attachments should be encrypted and personal or confidential data should be avoided in subject lines 
  * Where possible only the organisationâ€™s trusted networks or cloud services are used 
  * Steps are taken to ensure the security and confidentiality of paper records, such as by keeping them locked in a filing cabinet or drawer when not in use and making sure they are not left somewhere where they could be read by others, lost or stolen

There are certain privacy rules that your employer must follow when monitoring
you in the workplace and these rules also apply when you are working from
home. You can get information in our document on [ surveillance in the
