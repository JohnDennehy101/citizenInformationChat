##  Introduction

In the past, you had no legal right to ask for remote working but this changed
on 7 March 2024 under the Work Life Balance and Miscellaneous Provisions Act
2023 â€“ see more below.

Employers must ensure the safety, health, and welfare at work of all their
employees. Your employer has the same duty of care for your health and safety
when you are working from home (also called _remote working_ ). Employees also
have responsibilities when they are working from home.
