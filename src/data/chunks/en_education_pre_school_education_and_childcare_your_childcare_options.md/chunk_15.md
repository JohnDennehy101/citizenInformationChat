###  **Drop-in centres**

A drop-in centre offers a service for short periods during the day. These
centres are often provided in shopping centres, leisure centres and
accommodation facilities.

The service is provided as part of a customer or client service and children
are looked after while the parent is availing of a service or attending an
event.
