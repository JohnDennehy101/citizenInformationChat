##  How much does childcare cost?

Childcare costs depend on:

  * The type of childcare you choose 
  * The number of hours your child is cared for 
  * The level of staff training in that facility. 

Pre-school education provided under the [ Early Childhood Care and Education
Scheme (ECCE) ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/education/pre-school-
education-and-childcare/early-childhood-care-and-education-scheme/) is free
for 3 hours a day, 5 days a week, 38 weeks of the year. If your child attends
for more than 3 hours, you will be charged for the extra time.
