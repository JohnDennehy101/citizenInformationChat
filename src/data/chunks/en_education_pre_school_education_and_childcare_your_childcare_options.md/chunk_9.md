###  **Part-time day care**

Part-time day care is a structured service for children attending more than
3.5 hours and less than 5 hours per day. The childcare provider must offer the
same rest, play, and sanitary facilities as it does for children attending
full day care.

Part-time day care services may include Montessori groups, pre-schools,
cr√®ches, and playgroups.
