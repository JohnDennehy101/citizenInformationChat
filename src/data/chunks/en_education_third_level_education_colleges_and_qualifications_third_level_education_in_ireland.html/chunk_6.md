###  Other colleges

In addition to State-funded colleges, a number of fee-paying third-level
educational institutions offer courses, mainly in professional vocational
training and business.

Some of these colleges are linked to universities or professional associations
and their qualifications may be accredited accordingly (see 'Third-level
qualifications' below).
