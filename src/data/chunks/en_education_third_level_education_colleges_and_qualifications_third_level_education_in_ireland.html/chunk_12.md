####  Progression in education

Progression is a feature of the National Framework of Qualifications (NFQ).
Often a Level 6 certificate awarded by QQI can offer the opportunity to
continue on to a NFQ Level 7 or Level 8 degree.

The [ Higher Education Links Scheme ](https://www.qqi.ie/what-we-do/qqi-
awards/going-to-higher-education-using-my-qqi-award-learner) allows people
with a QQI Level 5 and Level 6 (NFQ) qualification to progress to higher
education.
