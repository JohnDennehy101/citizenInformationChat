###  Composting

Composting is the process of recycling organic matter, such as food waste or
leaves, naturally. Over time, the organic matter turns into a material called
compost which is full of nutrients and can be added to soil in the garden or
indoor plants.

You should [ compost your food waste ](/en/environment/waste-and-
recycling/composting-domestic-waste/) whenever possible, by using a brown bin
service or by [ composting at home ](https://www.mywaste.ie/what-to-do-with-
