##  Unfair selection

Your employer cannot select you for redundancy unless they can prove they
followed a fair process.

Your employer cannot select you for redundancy for personal or non-job-related
reasons.

They must be able to show the objective reasons (unbiased and factual reasons)
why you were selected and other employees were not selected.
