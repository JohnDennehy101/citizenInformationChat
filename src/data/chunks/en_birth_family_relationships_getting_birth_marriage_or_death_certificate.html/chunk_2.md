##  Introduction

It is a legal requirement in Ireland that a record is kept of each birth,
marriage and death that occurs in the State. When a birth, death, marriage or
adoption is recorded in Ireland, a certificate is issued to the people
concerned (for example, the parents if it is a birth, the couple if it is a
marriage and the next-of-kin if it is a death). This record is a very
important legal document and should be kept in a safe place. For example, a
birth certificate is required if you want to enrol your child in school or [
apply for an Irish passport ](/en/travel-and-recreation/passports/applying-
for-or-renewing-an-irish-passport/) . A death certificate is required if you
are [ dealing with the deceased person's estate ](/en/death/the-deceaseds-
estate/dealing-with-the-deceaseds-estate/) .

The [ General Register Office ](https://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/General-
Register-Office.aspx/) is where records relating to births, stillbirths,
deaths, marriages, civil partnerships and adoptions in Ireland are kept.

The General Register Office is responsible for the overall administration of
the civil registration service in Ireland. The HSE is responsible for the day-
to-day delivery of the service through local [ Civil Registration Service
offices ](https://www2.hse.ie/services/births-deaths-and-marriages/contact-a-
