##  Types of certificates

Birth, marriage, adoption, civil partnership and death certificates are public
records, meaning anybody can access or apply for them.

There are different types of certificates available from the General Register
Office.

**Type of certificate** |  **Purpose**  
---|---  
Full standard long form certificate  |  This is a certified copy of an entry in the register. It is the certificate used for legal and administrative purposes.   
Photocopy  |  Photocopies contain the same information as the certificate but you can only use them for research purposes.   
Authenticated  |  This is needed in certain circumstances only (in addition to the certified copy).   
Multilingual Standard Form (MSF)  |  An MSF provides a translation of a birth, death, marriage or civil partnership certificate so it can be used in another EU member state. The MSF itself has no legal effect. You must indicate which EU language you need and request it when applying for the certificate from the General Register Office or any Civil Registration Service.   
  
From 2019, [ public documents
](https://beta.e-justice.europa.eu/551/EN/public_documents) such as birth,
marriage, adoption, civil partnership or death certificates issued in an EU
country must be accepted as authentic by the authorities in another EU member
state without the need to carry an ‘Apostille’ or authenticity stamp.

If your certificate is required for use outside the EU, you can apply to the
General Register Office in Roscommon to have a new certificate issued with an
authentication stamp applied at the same time. Alternatively, if you already
have your certificate you can send it to the General Register Office to have
an authentication applied.
