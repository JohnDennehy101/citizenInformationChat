###  Main ways a creditor can enforce a judgment

There are 4 main ways a creditor can enforce a judgment which we explain
below:

  * Execution against goods 
  * Instalment orders, followed by committal orders (if necessary) 
  * Attachment of earnings 
  * Judgment mortgage (see more [ about home repossession ](/en/housing/losing-your-home-and-homelessness/home-repossession/) ) 

Other ways of enforcing judgments include attachment of debts, appointment of
a receiver and bankruptcy proceedings. These are rarely used for consumer
debts. They are briefly explained in ‘Other methods of enforcing judgments’
below.
