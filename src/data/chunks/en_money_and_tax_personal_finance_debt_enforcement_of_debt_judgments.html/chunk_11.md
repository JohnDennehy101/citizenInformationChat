####  What a Sheriff or Country Registrar cannot do

By law, the Sheriff or County Registrar cannot seize certain goods. They
cannot take your necessary clothes and bedding and the tools of your trade, if
the total value of such items is less than â‚¬19. In practice, goods with a low
resale value are unlikely to be seized. They are likely to take electrical
items, jewellery or your car (if you do not need it for work).
