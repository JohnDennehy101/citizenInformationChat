###  Attachment of a debt, or _garnishee order_

If you owe money to a creditor and another person owes money to you, then your
creditor can get a court order directing that person to pay the money directly
to the creditor. This is known as a _garnishee order_ .

Generally, it is used only where there are no goods to be seized to be offset
against the judgment. It is relatively rarely used in cases of consumer debt.

court order.
