##  Instalment orders

An instalment order is when you are ordered to repay the money you owe over a
period of time in instalments that are judged affordable based on your
circumstances.

Your creditor can apply to the District Court in the district in which you
live to have you attend the court to assess your financial situation and
ability to pay. The judge may then order payment in full or payment in
instalments, taking account of your financial situation.

The instalment order procedure is mainly used by small creditors such as shops
and credit unions. It can be used for judgments given in the District, Circuit
or High Court.

It is also used by creditors in family law proceedings, mainly for the
enforcement of [ maintenance orders ](/en/birth-family-
relationships/separation-and-divorce/maintenance-orders-and-agreements/) . If
you are a family law debtor, your creditor can get an  attachment of earnings
order  . An example of a family law debtor is if you have a maintenance order
against you which has not been met.

Instalment orders are governed by the Enforcement of Court Orders Acts
1926â€“2009.
