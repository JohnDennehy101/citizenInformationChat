##  What happens when the creditor has a judgment order?

When the creditor has a judgment order from a court, the judgment can be
enforced through an enforcement order. Enforcement orders can be issued by
court offices – the creditor does not have to go back to court for the order.

Creditors have 12 years from the date of the judgment order to look for
enforcement orders. Enforcement orders are usually valid for one year and can
then be renewed.

If more than 6 years have passed since the judgment order was issued, **a
Leave of the court** (the court’s permission) is needed to continue.
