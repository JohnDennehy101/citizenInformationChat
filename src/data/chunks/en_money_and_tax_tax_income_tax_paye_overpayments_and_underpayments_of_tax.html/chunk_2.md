##  Introduction

You can check whether you paid the right amount of tax for previous years and
whether the right information is being used to make your tax deductions this
year.

If you have paid too much tax, you can get a tax refund. You must claim a tax
refund within the 4 years following the year you paid the tax. To claim tax
back you must make a tax return.

If you have paid too little tax, you will owe Revenue the difference between
what you paid and what you should have paid. There are different options to
repay the tax depending on the amount you owe.
