###  How to repay tax you owe

If your Statement of Liability shows that you owe tax of less than €6,000, you
have the option to:

  * Pay all or part of it through myAccount 
  * Pay all or the remaining part of it by having your tax credits reduced for up to 4 years 

If the amount you owe is over €6,000, you can pay the amount through myAccount
or contact Revenue to discuss repayment options.

An underpayment will remain on your tax record with Revenue until it is paid.
You may have to pay interest and penalties if you owe tax to Revenue. If you
refuse to repay tax that is due, Revenue can take you to court.
