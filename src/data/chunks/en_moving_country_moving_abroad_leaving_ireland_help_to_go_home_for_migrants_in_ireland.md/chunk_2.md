##  What help can I get to leave Ireland?

You can get help to return to your home country if you do not have permission
to remain in Ireland. This is known as ‘voluntary return’.

The [ voluntary return programme ](https://www.irishimmigration.ie/my-
situation-has-changed-since-i-arrived-in-ireland/voluntary-returns/) can give
you financial and other support.

It can help you to return to your home country or another country where you
can legally stay.

This programme may be for you, if any of the following apply to you:

  * You are in Ireland illegally 
  * You have withdrawn your application for international protection 
  * You have been refused [ international protection ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/moving-country/asylum-seekers-and-refugees/the-asylum-process-in-ireland/if-your-application-for-refugee-status-is-refused/)
  * You have been notified that you will get a deportation order
