##  Who is a dependent relative?

The relative you claim for can be related to you or to your spouse or civil
partner if they are:

  * A parent who is widowed or is a surviving civil partner 
  * A son or daughter who lives with you and who you depend on because of your ill health or old age 
  * A relative who cannot maintain themselves due to age or illness 

Your dependant relative does not have to live in Ireland.

A child under the age of 18 will not qualify as a dependent relative unless
they live with and care for you. A child under 18 may qualify for the [
Incapacitated Child Tax Credit ](/en/money-and-tax/tax/tax-credits-and-
reliefs-for-people-with-disabilities/incapacitated-child-tax-credit/) .
