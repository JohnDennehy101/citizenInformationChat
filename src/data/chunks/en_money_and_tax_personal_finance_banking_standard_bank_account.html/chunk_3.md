##  Services and charges

When you open a basic bank account there are no charges for everyday banking
or maintenance fees for the first year.

After a year, the bank will review your account. You can continue to get free
banking for up to 5 years in total if the amount paid into your account each
year is less than the minimum wage.

Services that are free include:

Card services

  * Taking out money at an ATM (cash machine) 
  * Using a debit card in a shop to pay for something and for getting cash-back in a shop 
  * Using a debit card to pay for something online 

Transfers

  * Transferring money to another bank account 
  * Transferring money to pay a bill and other payments (like your electricity or heating or topping up your mobile) 
  * Putting money into the account (making a lodgement) 

Managing your account

  * Setting up and changing a standing order (this is where you have a regular amount coming out of your account and going into a savings account or to pay bills) 
  * Setting up a direct debit to automatically make regular payments where the amount can change, for example, for bills 
  * Getting a regular statement that tells you what is in your account, what you have taken out and your transaction history 
  * Using phone banking and online banking (there are no bank charges but there may be phone call or data charges) 

Ask the bank for a list of charges that do apply. These may include, for
example, charges for replacing a lost card or for using a card abroad.
