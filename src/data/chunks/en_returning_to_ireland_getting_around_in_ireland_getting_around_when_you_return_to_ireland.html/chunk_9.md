###  **Driving licences**

You must have a valid driving licence to drive in Ireland.

If you have a valid full foreign driving licence, you can drive on this for up
to 12 months while visiting Ireland.

If you have returned to live in Ireland permanently, you should [ exchange
your foreign driving licence to an Irish driving licence
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/travel-and-recreation/motoring/driver-
licensing/exchanging-foreign-driving-permit/) or start the [ driving test
process ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/travel-and-
recreation/motoring/driver-licensing/learning-to-drive/) here in Ireland.

Only driving licences issued by [ EU/EEA countries
](https://www.ndls.ie/holders-of-foreign-licences.html#to-apply-to-exchange-a-
foreign-driving-licence-issued-by-a-member-state-of-the-european-union-
european-economic-area) , the UK, and certain [ recognised states
](https://www.ndls.ie/holders-of-foreign-licences.html#to-apply-to-exchange-a-
foreign-driving-licence-issued-by-a-recognised-state) can be exchanged for an
Irish driving licence.

of expiry to renew your licence. If you have a learner permit, you have up to
5 years from the date of expiry.

**Motor Insurance, National Car Test (NCT) and Tax**

You must [ insure ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/returning-to-
ireland/getting-around-in-ireland/getting-motor-insurance-on-return-to-
ireland/) and [ tax ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/travel-and-
recreation/motoring/motor-tax-and-insurance/motor-tax-rates/) your vehicle

also have a valid [ National Car Test (NCT)
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/travel-and-recreation/vehicle-
standards/national-car-test/) .

Insurers will take [ overseas driving experience
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/returning_to_ireland/getting_around_in_ireland/Getting_motor_insurance_on_return_to_Ireland.html#lbc52a)
into account if you can prove that you have driven without any accidents or
claims abroad. In general, motor insurers will consider your no claims history
from the EEA and Switzerland, the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand,
Japan, Canada, South Africa, and the United States.

Many insurers will not give you a [ no claims discount
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/returning_to_ireland/getting_around_in_ireland/Getting_motor_insurance_on_return_to_Ireland.html#lf23f2)

abroad.

[ Renting a car in Ireland
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/consumer_affairs/motoring/renting_a_car.en.html)

years. This is where you rent vehicles from car rental companies on a pay-as-
