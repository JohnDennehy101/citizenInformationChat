##  Importing a vehicle

To [ import a car or any other type of vehicle to Ireland ](/en/moving-
country/moving-to-ireland/coming-to-live-in-ireland/importing-car-into-
ireland/) , you will need to meet certain legal requirements.

If you bring your vehicle to Ireland, you have to register the vehicle at a [
National Car Testing Service (NCTS) ](https://www.ncts.ie/1195/) centre within
30 days of the car arriving in Ireland and you may have to pay [ Vehicle
Registration Tax (VRT) ](https://www.revenue.ie/en/importing-vehicles-duty-
free-allowances/guide-to-vrt/vehicle-registration-tax/index.aspx) . You must
make an appointment with the NCTS within 7 days of the vehicle's arrival in
Ireland.

You can [ claim a relief from VRT ](https://www.revenue.ie/en/importing-
vehicles-duty-free-allowances/guide-to-vrt/reliefs-and-exemptions/transfer-of-
residence.aspx) if you are returning to Ireland permanently and you were using
the vehicle for more than 6 months before you moved to Ireland. In this case,
you must still register your vehicle, but you will not have to pay VRT.
