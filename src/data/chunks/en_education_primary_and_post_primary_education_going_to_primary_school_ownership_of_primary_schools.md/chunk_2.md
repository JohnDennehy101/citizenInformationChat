##  Introduction

Many primary schools in Ireland are owned and supported by the different
churches. The State pays the bulk of the building and running costs. Also, a
local contribution is often made towards the running costs.

In the case of Catholic and Church of Ireland schools, the owners are usually
the diocesan trustees. Other denominational schools usually have a board of
trustees nominated by the church authorities. Multi-denominational schools are
usually owned by a limited company or board of trustees.

Where primary schools are owned by the religious denominations. There are
deeds of trust signed by the owners, which ensure that the school will
continue to be used as such.

Gaelscoileanna may be denominational and come under the same patronage as
Catholic schools, but some have their own limited company. You can get more
information in our document about different [ types of primary schools.

The special schools have a range of different owners - some are owned by the [
Department of Education, ](https://www.gov.ie/en/organisation/department-of-
education/) some by the Commissioners of Public Works, some by the [ Health
Service Executive ](/en/health/health-system/health-service-executive/) and
some by religious orders.

There are a small number of 'model schools', which are owned by the State.

multidenominational schools with the transfer of patronage from certain
Catholic schools. The Department has published [ information about the
transfer of patronage and the change of ethos in schools
