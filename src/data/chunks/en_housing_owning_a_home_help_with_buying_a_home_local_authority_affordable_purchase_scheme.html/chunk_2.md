##  What is the Local Authority Affordable Purchase Scheme?

The Local Authority Affordable Purchase Scheme helps people on moderate
incomes to buy new homes at reduced prices. New homes under this scheme are
located in areas with the greatest housing need and where affordability is an
issue. The local authority takes a percentage stake in your home that covers
the reduction in price. So, if you buy the home at a 20% discount, the local
authority will have a 20% stake in your home.

You must buy back the local authorityâ€™s stake after 40 years or if you sell
your home, but you can repay it any time before this. This scheme is aimed at
first-time buyers, but there are some exceptions.

There is also the [ First Home Scheme ](/en/housing/owning-a-home/help-with-
buying-a-home/first-home-scheme/) , where the State and participating banks
pay up to 30% of the cost of your new home in return for a stake in your home.
