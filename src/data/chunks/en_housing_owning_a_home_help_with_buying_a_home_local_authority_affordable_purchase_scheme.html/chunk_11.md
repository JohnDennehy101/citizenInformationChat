###  How are applications prioritised?

If there are more applications than homes available, applications will be
prioritised based on the local authorities Scheme of Priority. The Scheme of
Priority must prioritise at least 70% of the units based on:

  1. How suitable the property is for the size of your household. For example, households with at least 3 people will be given priority for a 4-bedroom home. 
  2. When eligible applications are received. 

The remaining 30% of units are prioritised based on how suitable the property
is for the household and then on any additional requirements that the local
authority decide in their Scheme of Priority. For example, they may prioritise
applications from people living in their own local authority area.
