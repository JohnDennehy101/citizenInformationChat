##  What if I bought a home under a previousaffordable housing scheme?

There were a number of similar affordable housing schemes before this one, but
they were discontinued in 2011. However, there are still people living in
houses they bought under these schemes. This section describes what happens if
you want to sell a home you bought under one of these schemes.

If you sell your house within 20 years, you will have to pay the local
authority a percentage of the proceeds of the sale - known as clawback. This
percentage is the percentage difference between the sale price and the market
value of the house. This amount will be reduced by 10% each year after you
have owned your home for 10 years. So, if you sell your home after 20 years,
you will not have to pay any clawback to the local authority.

The market value at the time of selling your affordable home is used to
calculate the amount of clawback due to the local authority. If the gap
between the original sale price and market value has narrowed, the amount due
to the local authority will also reduce. If the proceeds of the sale of your
affordable home are below the initial price actually paid, you will not have
to pay the local authority a percentage of the proceeds of the sale.
