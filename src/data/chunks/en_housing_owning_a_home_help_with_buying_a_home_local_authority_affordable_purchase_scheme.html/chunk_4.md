To qualify for the scheme:

  * Your income must be below a certain level. This is calculated by multiplying your gross annual income by 4. This figure is known as your 'purchasing power' and it must then be less than 85.5% of the open market value of the affordable home. 

**OR**

  * You must have proof from a bank or financial institution that you cannot get a mortgage for 85.5% of the market value of the home. The applicant may not be able to get a mortgage for [ a number of reasons ](https://affordablehomes.ie/uploads/files/Affordable%20Purchase%20Scheme%20-%20Exceptions%20to%20Income%20Limits\(1\).pdf) , for example, because of their age.
