###  Deposit and savings

You must have a minimum deposit of 10% of the purchase price of the home.
However, if you have savings above a certain amount, you may not qualify for
the scheme.

You can have the money to cover the deposit for the home and an additional
â‚¬30,000. Anything above this is added to your purchasing power. And, if this
goes above 95% of the market value of the home you are not eligible for the
scheme.
