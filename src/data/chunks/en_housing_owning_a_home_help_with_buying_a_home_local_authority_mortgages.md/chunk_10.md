##  Where to apply for the Local Authority Home Loan

You should make an appointment with [ your local authority
](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/942f74-local-authorities/) to submit your
application form and supporting documents **in person** . If you post your
application, it may be sent back to you if it is not completed correctly.

The Local Authority Home Loan website has an [ FAQ page
](https://localauthorityhomeloan.ie/faq/) with answers to most questions about
the loan. If you need further help or have a question about an existing Local
Authority Home Loan, you should contact your local authority directly. You can
also email the Local Authority Home Loan with general queries using their [
online form ](https://localauthorityhomeloan.ie/contactus/) .

**Note:** The Local Authority Home Loan replaces the Rebuilding Ireland Home
Loan, the old local authority mortgages and the Home Choice Loan, which are
all no longer available.
