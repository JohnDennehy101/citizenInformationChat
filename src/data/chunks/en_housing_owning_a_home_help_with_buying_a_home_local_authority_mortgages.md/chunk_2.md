##  What is the Local Authority Home Loan?

The [ Local Authority Home Loan ](https://localauthorityhomeloan.ie/) is a
government-backed mortgage for first-time buyers and certain other applicants.

Loans are offered at reduced interest rates and can be used to buy new and
second-hand properties, or to build a home.

The interest rates are fixed for the full term of the mortgage, so you have
the same repayments for the lifetime of the loan.
