##  What are the interest rates?

Interest rates for the Local Authority Home Loan are:

  * 4.00% fixed interest rate for loans up to 25 years ( [ APR ](/en/money-and-tax/personal-finance/savings-and-investments/interest-on-loans-and-savings/) 4.07%) 
  * 4.05% fixed interest rate for loans over 25 years and up to 30 years (APR 4.13%) 

**Note:** Interest rates can change from time to time, but are set on the date
you drawdown your loan.

A fixed interest rate means that your monthly repayments remain the same for
the term of the loan. You can pay off all or part of your mortgage, but you
may have to pay a breakage fee.

You must sign up to the local authority collective Mortgage Protection
Insurance (MPI) scheme. You pay MPI monthly in addition to your loan
repayments.
