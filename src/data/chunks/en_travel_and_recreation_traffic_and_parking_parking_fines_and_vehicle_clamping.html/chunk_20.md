###  If you want to appeal a parking ticket

You can also appeal a parking ticket issued in a local authority area, if you
feel you have been fined unfairly. Take as much detail of the scene as you can
(photographs, details of road markings, etc.) and send them to the local
authority traffic division with your parking ticket and a letter outlining
your complaint.

Note that the NTA has no role in parking fine appeals, and these should be
addressed to the local authority.
