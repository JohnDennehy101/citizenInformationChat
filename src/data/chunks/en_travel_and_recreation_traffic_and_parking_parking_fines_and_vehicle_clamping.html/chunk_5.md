###  Permit parking

If there is on-street parking in operation on the street where you live, you
can get a resident's permit from the traffic division of your [ local
authority
](http://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/government_in_ireland/local_and_regional_government/local_authorities.html)
to park there. Your permit identifies the name of your street and varies in
price depending on your location. Each car owner can be issued with one
permit, and no more than four permits are issued to applicants of any one
household. If you live in a house that has been divided up into more than one
unit of accommodation, you are only entitled to one parking permit per unit.
Residents of purpose built apartment blocks are not eligible for residents'
permits.
