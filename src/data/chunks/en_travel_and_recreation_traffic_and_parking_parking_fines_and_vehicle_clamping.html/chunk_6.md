###  Private car parks

Private car parks are not regulated by the Government and revenue earned from
parking there goes directly to the owners of the car parks. The prices charged
in private car parks vary. Prices are determined by the car park owner. You
will usually be issued a ticket when you go into the car park and pay for
parking when you leave.
