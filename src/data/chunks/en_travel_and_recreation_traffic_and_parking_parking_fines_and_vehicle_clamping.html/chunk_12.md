###  A motorist from other countries

Under a cross-border project with Northern Ireland, motorists from Northern
Ireland who fail to pay parking fees or toll charges here can be pursued. The
Driver and Vehicle Agency in Northern Ireland will forward the motorist's
details to the appropriate local authority for parking offences or [ Transport
Infrastructure Ireland (TII) ](http://www.tii.ie/) for tolls. Similarly, if
you fail to pay a parking fee or toll in Northern Ireland, your details can be
passed to the authorities in Northern Ireland.

Motorists from other countries such as Poland, France or Germany can be
pursued for non-payment of tolls through a separate arrangement which
Transport Infrastructure Ireland has with these countries. It uses the
services of a specialist parking and tolling enforcement agency.
