##  What is human trafficking?

Human trafficking involves the use of deception, threats or physical force to
move a victim from one place to another in order to exploit them. In the case
of children, no force is required - the very act of transporting a child into
exploitative conditions constitutes trafficking.

Exploitation is a definitive element of human trafficking and distinguishes it
from immigration-related offenses such as ‘people smuggling’, for example,
where a migrant pays a third-party (a ‘smuggler’) to facilitate their illegal
entry into the state. You can read more about the relation between [ human
trafficking and people smuggling ](https://www.garda.ie/en/crime/human-
trafficking/what-s-the-difference-between-trafficking-and-smuggling-.html) on

Exploitation can take many forms, but includes:

  * **Sexual exploitation** , such as the prostitution of the victim or the production of pornography depicting the victim 
  * **Labour exploitation** , such as forcing the victim to perform manual labour, carry out domestic services, or participate in criminality or begging 
  * **Organ removal** , performed without the free, informed and specific consent of the donor
