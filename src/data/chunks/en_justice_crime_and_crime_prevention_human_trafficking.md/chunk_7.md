###  National Referral Mechanism

On 11 May 2021, the Government approved plans for a [ revised National
Referral Mechanism (NRM) ](https://www.gov.ie/en/press-
release/27823-government-approves-proposal-for-a-revised-national-referral-
mechanism-to-make-it-easier-for-human-trafficking-victims-to-come-forward-and-
receive-supports/) that is intended to make it easier for victims of human
trafficking to get support from state and civil society organisations.

Under the new scheme, several state and non-governmental organisations are to
join with An Garda Síochána in identifying victims of human trafficking and
providing them with access to the range of support services available through
the NRM.

These changes are set out in the [ Criminal Law (Sexual Offences and Human
Trafficking) Bill 2023 ](https://www.oireachtas.ie/en/bills/bill/2023/62/)
which is expected to become law in 2024.

You can read more about these changes in the Department of Justice’s [
National Action Plan to prevent and combat Human Trafficking 2023-2027 (pdf)
