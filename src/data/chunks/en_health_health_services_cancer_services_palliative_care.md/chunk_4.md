###  Hospice care

A hospice is a unit where the main activity is providing specialist palliative
care. Other services are developed around these units such as in-patient care,
day care, community palliative care, out-patient care and bereavement
services.

You may be referred for specialist palliative care in a hospice if you have a
progressive, life-limiting condition and your needs become, or are expected to
become, more difficult to manage (see ‘How to get a referral for palliative
care’ below).

There are 13 hospice units in Ireland. They are located in:

  * Cork 
  * Donegal 
  * Dublin (4 hospice units) 
  * Galway
