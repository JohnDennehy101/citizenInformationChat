##  Children's palliative care

Palliative care for children is delivered differently from the palliative care
services for adults.

Palliative care for children is usually provided at home. In the home, the
family is supported by their family doctor, public health nurse and the
specialist palliative care team (where available).

In hospitals, paediatric-trained staff provide medical and nursing care, with
support from the specialist palliative care service.

There is more information on palliative care for children on [ The Palliative
Hub for Children and Young People ](http://www.childrenspalliativehub.com/) .
