##  What is palliative care?

Palliative care helps people with a life-limiting illness to improve their
quality of life and manage symptoms. Life-limiting illness means a condition,
illness or disease that is progressive and cannot be cured.

Palliative care is available to people of all ages and at any stage of their
illness.

Palliative care includes psychological, social and spiritual support for the
patient and their family or carers, and includes support in bereavement.

You may be referred to palliative care services if you have been diagnosed
with a life-limiting condition such as cancer, heart failure or motor neuron
disease. The Health Service Executive (HSE) is responsible for providing
palliative care services.
