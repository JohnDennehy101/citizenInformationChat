##  Is there a charge for ECCE?

There is no charge to parents for the playschool or daycare hours provided
under the ECCE scheme. The Department pays the playschool or daycare service
to provide these ECCE hours. However, if your child attends for extra hours,
you will have to pay for these extra hours in the normal way.

A service may charge parents for extra activities. However, these must be
optional and the service must provide other appropriate activities to children
who donâ€™t take part in the optional activity being charged for.

**Booking deposits**

The service may ask you for a booking deposit, which cannot be more than 4
weeks of ECCE capitation payments. Any deposit you pay must be repaid to you
by the end of October of the year your child starts.

**Rates for service providers**

For providers of daycare and sessional services, the Department pays a weekly
fee for each child over the school year. Daycare and sessional playschools
with more highly qualified staff may be able to qualify for a higher fee.
