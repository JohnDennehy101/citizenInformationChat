##  Change of vehicle ownership and motor tax

If you sell your vehicle or trade it in for a replacement, you must register
the change of ownership. You cannot tax your new vehicle until the [ change of
ownership has been registered ](/en/travel-and-recreation/motoring/buying-or-
selling-a-vehicle/change-of-ownership/) . You can [ check the status of the
vehicle on motortax.ie ](https://www.motortax.ie/OMT/changeOwnership.do) .

You then renew the motor tax on the vehicle using Form RF100A or online as
described in ‘How to apply’. If the motor tax on your new vehicle has already
expired, you do not have to pay the arrears due from the expiry of the last
tax disc to the end of the month immediately before the date you bought it.

It is an offence to drive without paying motor tax, so you should not drive
until you have received confirmation that the registration has occurred and
you have paid the motor tax.
