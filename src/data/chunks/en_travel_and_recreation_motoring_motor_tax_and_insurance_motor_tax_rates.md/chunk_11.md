##  Vehicle off the road

If your vehicle is temporarily off the road, you do not have to pay motor tax
for that period. You must declare in advance that your vehicle will be off the
road and not in use for a period of between 3 and 12 months.

To do this, you must:

  * Complete a [ Declaration of Non-Use of a Motor Vehicle Form RF150 (pdf) ](https://www.motortax.ie/OMT/pdf/RF150_en.pdf)
  * Submit it to your motor tax office. 

The declaration of non-use must be made in the same month that your current
motor tax disc expires. If arrears in motor tax are due, these must be paid in
full and you must also pay a minimum of 3 months of motor tax before a
declaration of non-use can be made.
