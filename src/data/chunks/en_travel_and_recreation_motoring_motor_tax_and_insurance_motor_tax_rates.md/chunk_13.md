###  Island vehicles

If your vehicle is kept and used exclusively on an offshore island, you can
tax it at a reduced rate. However, island vehicles cannot be taxed online,
they can only be taxed by your local motor tax office. Contact your local
authority for more information including details of the documents you need.
