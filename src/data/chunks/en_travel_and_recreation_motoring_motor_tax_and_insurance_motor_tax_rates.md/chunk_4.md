##  How to apply for motor tax

You can pay motor tax:

  * Online at [ motortax.ie ](https://www.motortax.ie/OMT/)
  * In person at your [ local motor tax office ](https://www.gov.ie/en/service/1fc151-find-your-local-motor-tax-office/)
  * By post 

There are some differences if you are taxing a vehicle for the first time or
if you are renewing your motor tax.

You will also need additional documentation if you are taxing a goods or
commercial vehicle, see the section on ‘Commercial vehicles’ below.
