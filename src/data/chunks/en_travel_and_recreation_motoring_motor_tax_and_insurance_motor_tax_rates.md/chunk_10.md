##  How to apply for a refund for motor tax

It is possible in certain circumstances to claim a refund of motor tax. [
Apply for a refund directly to your local motor tax office on Form RF120 (pdf)
](https://www.motortax.ie/OMT/pdf/RF120_en.pdf) , along with supporting
documents. The form must be witnessed and stamped by a member of the Garda
Síochána.

You can claim a refund of motor tax if the vehicle:

  * Has been scrapped, destroyed or sent permanently out of the State 
  * Has been stolen and has not been recovered by the owner 
  * Has not been taken out or used in a public place at any time since the issue of the current disc 

As the owner, you can claim a refund if you have stopped using the vehicle:

  * Due to illness, injury or other physical disability 
  * As you are absent from the country for business or educational purposes 
  * As you are serving overseas with the Defence Forces 

You must return your tax discs immediately as refunds are generally calculated
from the first of the month after the disc is surrendered. A minimum of 3
unexpired whole calendar months must be left on the disc.

If the vehicle has been scrapped, you need a certificate of destruction from
an [ End-of-Life Vehicle (ELV) Authorised Treatment Facility ](/en/travel-and-
recreation/motoring/buying-or-selling-a-vehicle/how-to-dispose-of-an-end-of-
