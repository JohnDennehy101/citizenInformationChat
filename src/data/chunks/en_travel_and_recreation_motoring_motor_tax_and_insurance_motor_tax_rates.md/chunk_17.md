###  Vintage vehicles

A 'vintage' vehicle for motor tax purposes is a vehicle that is 30 or more
years old. In determining whether or not the vehicle qualifies for 'vintage'
status, the chassis number of the vehicle and the vehicle registration book or
vehicle registration certificate must clearly display the age of the vehicle.
