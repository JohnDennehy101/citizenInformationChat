###  Cognitive behavioural therapist

Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) aims to reduce mental health problems, and
behaviour by changing your behaviour and thinking patterns.

CBT professionals believe that changes in thinking can reduce distress and
bring about a change in symptoms and behaviour. This change can happen by

  * Practicing new behaviours, and 
  * Analysing thinking patterns. 

Cognitive behavioural therapists may not all be psychologists or
psychiatrists. You should check with your [ HSE Local Health Office
](https://www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/1/lho/) to see if the service is
available in your area.
