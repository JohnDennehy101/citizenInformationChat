###  Psychologist

A psychologist is trained in the study of human behaviour and tries to explain
feelings, thoughts and behaviour.

Psychologists can assess and treat a wide range of psychological problems such
as anxiety and depression. They can also help you examine the effects your
illness is having on your life and ways you can cope with those effects. A
psychologist will try to bring you closer to understanding your illness.

Within mental health, the psychologist usually works as a clinical, community
or counselling psychologist. They do not prescribe medication unless they are
also medically qualified.

The psychologist works in different ways such as group work, telephone
consultations or one-to-one consultations.
