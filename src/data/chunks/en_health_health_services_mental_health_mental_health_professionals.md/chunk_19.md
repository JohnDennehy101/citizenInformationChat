###  Psychiatric nurse

A psychiatric nurse plays a central role in the care of the psychiatric
patient, both in a hospital setting and in the community.

They work within a psychiatric service as part of a health care team. They
provide you with physical and psychological care and can also provide
essential support and encouragement to your family. The psychiatric nurse's
activities can include:

  * Providing day patient care 
  * Organising detoxification programmes 
  * Educating student nurses and community groups 
  * Supporting and educating your family 
  * Providing group therapies, individual counselling 
  * Liaising with in-patient services, GPs, strategy and voluntary organisations 
  * Organising admissions to hospital and reception 
  * Making initial assessment of referrals from GPs 

The community psychiatric nurse usually keeps contact with patients after they
are discharged from hospital by calling to their homes and attending out-
patients' clinics and day care centres.
