###  Addiction counsellor

Addiction counsellors provide assessment, counselling, information and [
addiction treatment services
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/health/health-services/alcohol-and-
drug-treatment-services/alcohol-addiction-services/) for people suffering from
alcohol, drugs and gambling addictions.

Before getting counselling for addiction, you must go through a detoxification
programme, if necessary. You are then referred to the community-based
addiction treatment service.

Individual and group counselling is often used, focusing on the consequences
of your behaviour caused by the addiction. The main part of the treatment
examines the triggering factors that lead to the development of the addiction.

Target goals are set to try and establish new patterns of healthy behaviour.
An important part of the treatment is to involve a family member, who can help
you achieve these targets. Addiction counselling lasts for an average of 6 to
8 weeks and is followed by an after-care service.
