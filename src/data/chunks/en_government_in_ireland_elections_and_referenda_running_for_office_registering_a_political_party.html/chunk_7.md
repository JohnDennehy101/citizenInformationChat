###  Party emblems

An application to register a political party emblem will not be granted if the
emblem:

  * Is likely to be confused by voters with a registered emblem used by another party 
  * Is obscene or offensive 
  * Is of such a character that its publication would be likely to amount to the commission of an offence 
  * Includes a word or expression, which if it was or was part of the party's name, would prevent the party from being registered.
