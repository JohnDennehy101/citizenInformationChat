###  Pharmacist extension of prescriptions

If your prescription was issued **before 1 March 2024** , the maximum legal
validity of your prescription is 6 months. Pharmacists may extend
prescriptions for up to 3 months if they think it safe and appropriate

If your 6-month prescription is dated **1 March 2024 or later,** a pharmacist
may extend this prescription to 12 months in total.

This means that from 1 September 2024, if you have a 6-month prescription you
can request an extension to if from your pharmacist if it is dated from 1
March 2024.

Prescriptions written after 1 March 2024 for other periods cannot be extended
by a pharmacist.

So, when your 6-month prescription is due to end you can ask your pharmacist
to extend it. This means that you may not need to visit your doctor for a
repeat prescription.

However, extensions will not be automatically granted. Your pharmacist will
use their clinical judgement to decide if it is safe to extend your
prescription.

Certain medications will not be eligible for prescription extension.
