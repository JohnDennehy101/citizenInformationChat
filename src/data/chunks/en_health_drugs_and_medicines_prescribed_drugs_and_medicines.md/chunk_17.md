##  Generic drugs and reference pricing

Sometimes the pharmacist may give you a different brand name of the medicine
you are prescribed. This is because there is a less expensive version of the
brand name medicine called a generic version. The pharmacist is allowed do
this if the medicines are included in the [ list of interchangeable drugs
published by the HPRA ](http://www.hpra.ie/homepage/medicines/special-
topics/generic-and-interchangeable-medicines/list-of-interchangeable-
medicines) . The list includes all medicines which can be substituted for one
another.

The HPRA has published an [ information leaflet about generic medicines (pdf)
](http://www.hpra.ie/docs/default-source/publications-forms/information-
leaflets/generic-medicines_web.pdf?sfvrsn=4) .
