##  Getting a prescription

If you need specific drugs and medicines, certain healthcare professionals can
give you a prescription for them, such as a GP, a consultant, a dentist or a
nurse.

A nurse must be employed by a health service provider to be able to give you a
prescription. Nurses can only prescribe drugs and medicines relevant to the
area they work in. There are specific restrictions on certain controlled
drugs.

GPs and specialists can email prescriptions to pharmacists.
