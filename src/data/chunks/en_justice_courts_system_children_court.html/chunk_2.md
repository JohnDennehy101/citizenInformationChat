##  Introduction

The Children Court deals with criminal charges involving children under the
age of 18.

[ The Children Act 2001
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2001/en/act/pub/0024/index.html) is the main
piece of legislation that deals with youth justice. The Act aims to ensure
that the work of the Children Court considers the best interests of the child
concerned.

This page describes the rules of the Children Court, including the types of
cases it hears, privacy and in-camera rules, and the age of criminal
responsibility for children.
