###  **Age of children dealt with by the Children Court**

The Children Court deals with criminal proceedings for children under the age
of 18. Generally, children under 12 will not be charged with an offence.

However, if a child is aged 10 or 11, their case may be heard in the Central
Criminal Court if they are charged with these offences:

  * Murder, 
  * Manslaughter 
  * Rape, or 
  * Aggravated sexual assault
