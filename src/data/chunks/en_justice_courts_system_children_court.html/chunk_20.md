###  **Court proceedings are held in private**

The [ in-camera rule ](/en/justice/legal-terms-explained/) applies to the
Children Court, and means that the court proceedings cannot be held in public.
However, the decisions and orders of the Children Court are made available to
the public.

However, as proceedings are held in private, if a report reveals the name,
address, or school of the child, or includes information likely to identify
the child, it cannot be published or broadcast unless the court orders
specific details to be revealed for a specified reason. It is a criminal
offence to break this privacy rule.
