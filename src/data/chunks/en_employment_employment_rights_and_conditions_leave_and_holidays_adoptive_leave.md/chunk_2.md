##  What is adoptive leave?

If you are a parent who is adopting alone or as part of an adopting couple,
you can get 24 weeks’ leave off work with adoptive leave. Only one parent in
the couple can qualify for adoptive leave.

The 24 weeks start from the date the child is placed in your care.

Your employer does not have to pay you during adoptive leave, unless it is
included in your contract. You can get [ Adoptive Benefit ](/en/social-
welfare/families-and-children/adoptive-benefit/) , if you have enough PRSI
contributions.

You can take up to 16 additional weeks’ unpaid adoptive leave, but you cannot
claim Adoptive Benefit for these extra weeks.

You must give your employer 4 weeks’ notice **in writing** if you plan to take
adoptive leave – see ‘Applying for adoptive leave’ below.
