##  Applying for adoptive leave

You must give your employer **4 weeks’ notice** **in writing** that you plan
to take adoptive leave. The 4-week rule applies whether you are adopting a
child in Ireland or from another country. In your letter, tell your employer
the date when you expect to start your leave.

If you want to take the additional 16 weeks’ adoptive leave, you must also
give your employer at least 4 weeks’ written notice. You can give notice about
the adoptive leave and the additional adoptive leave at the same time.

If you do not give notice, you may lose your rights to adoptive leave.
