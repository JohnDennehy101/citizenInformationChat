##  Who can take adoptive leave?

_Qualifying adopters_ can take adoptive leave. A qualified adopter is either:

  * The sole adopter, in the case of a parent who is adopting a child on their own 
  * The _nominated parent_ in the case of an adopting couple 

The adopting couple can choose who should take the adoptive leave (they must
decide who will be the nominated parent).

An adopting couple means:

  * A married couple 
  * A couple who are civil partners 
  * A [ cohabiting couple ](/en/birth-family-relationships/cohabiting-couples/rights-of-cohabiting-couples/) adopting a child 

The parent who does not take adoptive leave is entitled to [ paternity leave
