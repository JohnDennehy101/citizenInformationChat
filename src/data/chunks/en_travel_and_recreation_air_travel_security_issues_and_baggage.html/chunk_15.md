###  Security check before boarding your flight

Before boarding your flight, your hand baggage will be scanned and checked by
security staff.

Have your laptop and any other electrical devices ready to place in trays at
the airport security point. It is also advisable to have all your devices
fully charged before you travel. If youâ€™re not sure what you can bring, check
with your airline to see which electronic devices and electrical equipment are
allowed on board.

Never carry packages with unidentified contents on behalf of other people. If
you are asked to do so, you should contact the airport police, customs or
member of staff immediately.

Your checked baggage will be screened by security prior to loading. Airline
liability can be reduced for both checked and unchecked baggage if your
baggage was:

  * Packed in an unsuitable way. 
  * Packed in a damaged bag or case. 
  * Presented after the recommended check-in time.
