###  Capital Gains Tax

The **property purchase incentive relief** from CGT (for the first 7 years of
ownership) for properties purchased between 7 December 2011 and 31 December
2014 is not being extended beyond 31 December 2014. Where property purchased
in this period is held for seven years the gains accrued in that period will
not attract CGT.

**Windfall tax provisions** introduced in 2009 which apply an 80% rate of tax
to certain profits or gains from land disposals or land development, where
those profits or gains are attributable to a relevant planning decision by a
planning authority, are being abolished from 1 January 2015\.
