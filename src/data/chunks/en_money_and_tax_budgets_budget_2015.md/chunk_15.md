####  JobsPlus

There will be a doubling of JobsPlus places from 3,000 to 6,000 to incentivise
employers to hire long-term unemployed people from the Live Register.
Employers can receive up to â‚¬10,000 in monthly cash grants over 2 years for
each eligible employee.

A new JobsPlus strand for young people will be launched in 2015 under the
Youth Guarantee.
