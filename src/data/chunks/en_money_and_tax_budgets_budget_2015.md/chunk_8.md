###  Excise Duties

The excise duty on a **packet of 20 cigarettes** is being increased by 40 cent
(including VAT) with a pro-rata increase on the other tobacco products, with
effect from midnight on 14 October 2014.

The excise duty on **roll-your-own tobacco** is being increased by an
additional 20 cent (including VAT) per 25g pouch with effect from midnight on
14 October 2014.

The enactment of the Betting (Amendment) Bill 2013 will allow for the
extension of **Betting Duty** to remote operators and betting exchanges in
2015.

The **Vehicle Registration Tax (VRT)** reliefs available for the purchase of
hybrid electric vehicles, plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, plug-in electric
vehicles, and electric motorcycles are being extended to 31 December 2016.

The special relief reducing the standard rate of Alcohol Products Tax by 50%
on **beers produced in microbreweries** which produce not more than 20,000
hectolitres per year is being extended to apply to microbreweries which
produce not more than 30,000 hectolitres per year.

A 30 day deferral of **excise duty on mineral oil** is provided for. To allow
for Revenue to revise the collection system, this measure will be subject to a
commencement order. This has an Exchequer cash-flow cost but does not impact
general government deficit.

The excise rate for **Natural Gas and BioGas as a propellant** will be set at
the current EU Minimum rate and this rate will be held for a period of 8
years.
