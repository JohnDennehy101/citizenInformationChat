####  Corporation Tax and international tax planning

The 12.5% **Corporation Tax** will not change. This rate will continue to be a
key element of Ireland’s Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) strategy.

Changes to our **residency rules** to require all companies registered in
Ireland to also be tax resident. This will eliminate the ‘Double Irish’ tax
scheme. This legal change will take effect from 1 January 2015 for new
companies. For existing companies there will be a transition period until the
end of 2020.

A ‘ **Knowledge Development Box** ’ (also known as a patent box) with tax and
other incentives will be put in place to encourage foreign direct investment
in the intellectual property and new technology areas.
