###  **One-Parent Family Payment**

If you get half-rate Carerâ€™s Allowance, you may also get [ One-Parent Family
Payment ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/families-and-
children/one-parent-family-payment/) until your youngest child turns 16 (as
long as you continue to meet the conditions for both schemes).
