###  **Change of circumstances**

If your circumstances change, you must tell the Department of Social
Protection (DSP), as it may affect your entitlement to Carer’s Allowance.

You may be able to update your details online using [ MyWelfare
](https://services.mywelfare.ie/) .

If you can’t update your details on MyWelfare, you can tell the DSP about your
changed circumstance by phone, email, or post (see contact details under ‘More
information’ below).
