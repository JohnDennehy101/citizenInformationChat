###  **How your means are assessed**

To get your total weekly means, the DSP adds your sources of assessable income
(such as cash and capital) together.

  * If you are single, €450 of your total weekly income is not taken into account in the means test for Carer’s Allowance. 
  * If you are married, in a civil partnership, or [ cohabiting ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/birth-family-relationships/cohabiting-couples/rights-of-cohabiting-couples/#e6e823) , the first €900 of your combined total weekly income is not taken into account. 

For a couple, your means are taken to be half of the total means of yourself
and your spouse, civil partner, or cohabitant. Read our page about [ assessing
the means of a couple for Carer’s Allowance
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-
system/means-test-for-social-welfare-payments/assessing-the-means-of-a-
couple/#8e6b86) .

The DSP will calculate your weekly means. If your weekly means is over a
certain amount, you will get a reduced rate of Carer’s Allowance. You can find
the reduced Carer’s Allowance rates based on weekly means in [ DSP’s rates of
payment booklet
