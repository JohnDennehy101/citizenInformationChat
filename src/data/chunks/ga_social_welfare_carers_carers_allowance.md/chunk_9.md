####  **Baby kept in hospital after birth**

If your baby is kept in hospital, or in another institution to get medical
treatment immediately after their birth, you can get Carer’s Allowance for up
to 18 months while they are in hospital. This applies to babies born on or
after 1 January 2023 only.

To get Carer’s Allowance, your baby must meet the criteria for [ Domiciliary
Care Allowance ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/social-
welfare-payments/disability-and-illness/domiciliary-care-allowance/) .
However, you do not need to be getting Domiciliary Care Allowance to get [
Carer’s Benefit ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-
welfare/carers/carers-benefit/) .
