###  **Care-sharing**

You can share your caring responsibilities with another carer, where you each
care for the person on a part-time basis.

You both must provide care from Monday to Sunday, but on alternate weeks. By
law, anyone providing full-time care on a part-time basis must do so for a
complete week (Monday to Sunday).

You must meet all the usual qualifying conditions for Carer’s Allowance.

In this case, you and the second carer share:

  * A single Carer’s Allowance payment, and 
  * The annual Carer's Support Grant. 

You each get [ Free Travel ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-
