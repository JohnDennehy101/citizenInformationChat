##  Management and staffing of pre-school childcare services

The [ Childcare Regulations of 2016
](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/1a6d67-child-care-act-1991-early-years-
services-regulations-2016/) also set out rules for how pre-school childcare
services are managed and staffed. There must be enough suitable and competent
adults working directly with children at all times.

Anyone working with pre-school children must have appropriate qualifications.

If you donâ€™t yet have a qualification, you can [ apply for a Letter of
Temporary Permission to Practice
](https://www.gov.ie/en/service/000073-recognition-of-an-early-years-
qualification/#temporary-student-recruitment-in-early-learning-and-care) , so
long as you:

  * Have completed the first year of an approved course, and 
  * Have completed a practice placement where you worked with children as part of your studies 

DCEDIY has published a [ list of recognised qualifications (pdf)
](https://www.gov.ie/pdf/239042/?page=null) for the purposes of the
Department's childcare programmes.

All staff, students and volunteers who have access to any child in a child
care service must be [ Garda vetted
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/employment/employment-rights-and-
conditions/data-protection-at-work/garda-vetting/) . Garda vetting is a
process to check if a person working with children and vulnerable adults, or
providing services involving access to them, has a criminal record, or any
history that might pose a threat to vulnerable people.
