###  **Behaviour management**

Anyone providing a pre-school childcare service must ensure that no corporal
punishment is inflicted on any child attending the service.

The provider should have written policies and procedures to manage a childâ€™s
challenging behaviour and to assist the child to manage their behaviour.
