Tusla has published a [ Quality and Regulatory Framework (QRF)
](https://www.tusla.ie/services/preschool-services/early-years-
providers/early-years-provider-resources/early-years-quality-and-regulatory-
framework/) , to help childcare services to comply with the 2016 regulations.

](https://www.tusla.ie/services/preschool-services/early-years-
providers/early-years-inspections-2/) to check services meet the standards
required.
