####  **State Pension (Contributory)**

The [ State Pension (Contributory) ](/en/social-welfare/older-and-retired-
people/state-pension-contributory/) is payable from the age of 66. You are
allowed to have income from any other source while you receive this pension,
but both the income and the pension are taxable.

There are a number of pro-rata State Pensions (Contributory) which are paid at
a lower rate. These were introduced to deal with issues that arose as a result
of people paying different types of social insurance contributions or not
paying contributions for various reasons.

Under the [ National Pensions Framework
](http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/234_National-Pensions-Framework.aspx) , a
number of other changes are planned to the qualifying conditions for the State
Pension (Contributory). These changes do not affect the State Pension (Non-
Contributory).
