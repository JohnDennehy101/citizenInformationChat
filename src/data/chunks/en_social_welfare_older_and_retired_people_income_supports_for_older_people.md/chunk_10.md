####  **Occupational and personal pensions**

[ Occupational pensions ](/en/money-and-tax/personal-
finance/pensions/occupational-pensions/) are organised by employers to provide
pensions to employees on retirement or to surviving dependants on the death of
an employee. Personal pensions or [ Personal Retirement Savings Accounts
(PRSAs) ](/en/money-and-tax/personal-finance/pensions/personal-retirement-
savings-accounts/) are organised individually by self-employed people or
employed people who do not have an occupational pension scheme.

You need to deal directly with the pension provider to find out exactly what
benefits your pension gives you. The Pensions Authority is the regulatory body
for occupational pensions and PRSAs. If you have a complaint, the Authority
will advise you about your rights. The Pensions Ombudsman investigates and
decides on complaints relating to occupational pensions and PRSAs. Generally,
you may have income from other sources, for example, from work, if you are
receiving a pension. There are some restrictions on people getting both a
pension and employment income from the public sector â€“ you should check with
the pension provider.
