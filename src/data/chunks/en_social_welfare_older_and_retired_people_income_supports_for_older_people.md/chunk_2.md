##  Information

A range of payments are made to older people by the Department of Social
Protection (DSP) and the Health Service Executive. If you are unsure whether
or not you would qualify for a payment, you should apply anyway.

Generally payments are made up of a personal payment for yourself and extra
amounts for your dependent spouse, civil partner or cohabitant and any
dependent children. A cohabitant is a person living in an intimate and
committed relationship with a person of the same or opposite sex who is not
that personâ€™s spouse, civil partner, or a close relative.

You should apply to the Department of Social Protection for your pension at
least **3 months in advance** .
