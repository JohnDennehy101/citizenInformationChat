####  **Working in retirement**

If you are getting a means-tested payment, working or being self-employed
affects the amount of that payment. You should check with the Department of
Social Protection before taking up work to see what the effect will be. You
can have up to â‚¬200 earnings from insurable employment without affecting your
State Pension (Non-Contributory).

See [ moving from work to retirement ](/en/employment/retirement/older-people-
and-working/working-in-retirement/) for more information on working in
retirement, income tax etc.

Further information and application forms are available from [ your local
Citizen Information Centre ](http://centres.citizensinformation.ie/) and the
Citizens Information Phone Service at 0818 07 4000.
