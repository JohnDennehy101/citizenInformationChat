Employers must inform and consult employees on any decisions likely to lead to
substantial changes to work organisation or contractual relations.

Employers with at least 50 employees must engage in this process and consult
with employeesâ€™ union or, if no union exists, with chosen employee
representatives.

**Information you must get**

You or your union must get the following details of the transfer:

  * The reasons for the transfer 
  * The date or proposed date of the transfer 
  * An assessment of the legal, economic, and social implications for the employees 

If you are part of a union, the union must get this information no later than
30 days before the transfer.

If you are not part of a union, you must get the information in writing from
your employer no later than 30 days before the transfer.

This requirement also applies to employers with less than 50 employees.
