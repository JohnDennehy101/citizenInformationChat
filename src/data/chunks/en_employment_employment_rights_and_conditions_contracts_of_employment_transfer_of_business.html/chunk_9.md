###  **Contract of employment**

Your new employer is legally obligated to take on the existing employees of
the business. They must maintain the same terms and conditions, except
pensions (explained below).

This means that the terms and conditions in your [ employment contract
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/employment/employment-rights-and-
conditions/contracts-of-employment/contract-of-employment/) and your
employerâ€™s obligations, automatically transfer to your new employer.

If there is a collective agreement in place, for example, on shift
arrangements or overtime) your new employer must continue to keep to its terms
and conditions until it either expires or is replaced.

A transfer of business does not break your continuity of service for [
redundancy legislation
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/employment/unemployment-and-
redundancy/redundancy/) purposes. Instead, it carries over to your new
employment.
