##  What is a transfer of undertakings?

A transfer of undertakings (also known as TUPE) is when employees are moved to
a new employer as part of a legal merger or the sale of a business.

For a transfer of undertaking to take place, the following conditions must be
met:

  * There must be a change in the entity (either an individual or a company) responsible for managing the business. 
  * The new employer must continue the previous economic activities of the business. 
  * The business must be transferred as a "going concern".
