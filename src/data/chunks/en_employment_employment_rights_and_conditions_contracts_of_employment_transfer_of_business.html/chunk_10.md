###  **Pension rights**

Employee pension rights in relation to old age, invalidity, or survivor
benefits generally do not transfer to the new employer.

If you have an existing occupational pension, it may not continue in the same
way. This means the new employer is not obligated to make the same pension
contributions on your behalf. However, any entitlements you have built up
before the transfer must be protected by the new employer.

If your previous employer offered entitlements similar to pension schemes,
such as a lump sum entitlement on dismissal before retirement, the new
employer must ensure that those rights are protected and continue.

Itâ€™s important to note that pensions under TUPE law can be complex, and you
may need to contact the trustees of your pension scheme or get legal advice
for more guidance.
