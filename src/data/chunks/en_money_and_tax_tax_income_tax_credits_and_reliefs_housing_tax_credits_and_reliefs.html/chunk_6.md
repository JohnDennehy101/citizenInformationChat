##  Tax when providing short-term guest accommodation

If you have income from providing accommodation to occasional visitors for
short periods, for example through an online accommodation booking site, this
income is not considered to be rental income. This is because the visitors use
the accommodation as guests rather than tenants. Revenue have published [ a
guidance manual on how such income is treated for tax purposes (pdf)
](https://www.revenue.ie/en/tax-professionals/tdm/income-tax-capital-gains-
