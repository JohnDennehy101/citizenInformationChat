##  Rent-a-room relief

If you rent out a room or flat in your home, you are exempt from income tax on
the amount that your tenant pays you for rent and other services, up to
â‚¬14,000 in a tax year.

[ Rent-a-room relief ](/en/housing/owning-a-home/home-owners/renting-a-room-
in-your-home/) applies only to residential tenancies, not to short-term guest
arrangements. The relief can also apply to a self-contained unit (such as a
basement flat) if it is part of your home or is directly attached to it.

You are not eligible for Rent-a-room relief if you are renting the room to
your son or daughter.
