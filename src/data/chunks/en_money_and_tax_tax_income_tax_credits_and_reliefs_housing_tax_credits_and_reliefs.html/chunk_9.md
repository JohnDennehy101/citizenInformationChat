##  Tax when transferring ownership

When ownership of a property is transferred, the financial gains are usually
liable to tax but some exemptions and reliefs apply.

For instance, when you sell a property, any profit you make over the amount
that you paid for it would usually be liable for Capital Gains Tax. There is
however an exemption if the property is the main residence where you live. [

If you get property as a gift or inheritance, you may have to pay Capital
Acquisitions Tax. A number of reliefs and exemptions apply including if the
transfer is between spouses or civil partners or, in certain circumstances, if
you get a house that has been your main residence. [ Read more about Capital

You may also have to pay stamp duty when ownership of a property is
transferred but there are some exemptions. [ Read more about stamp duty
