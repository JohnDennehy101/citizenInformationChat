##  Partial Capacity Benefit rates

Partial Capacity Benefit is made up of a personal rate for you and may include
increases for your qualified adult and qualified child(ren). The personal rate
of payment is based on the assessment of your restriction on capacity for
work, whether you were in receipt of Illness Benefit or Invalidity Pension and
your current rate of payment.
