##  How long can I get Partial Capacity Benefit?

If you are coming from Invalidity Pension, your Partial Capacity Benefit (PCB)
will continue for up to 3 years (156 weeks), or until you turn 66. You can
apply for PCB again at the end of the 3 years. You will be reassessed to find
out if you qualify.

If you are coming from Illness Benefit, your PCB payment will continue to the
end of your entitlement to Illness Benefit.
