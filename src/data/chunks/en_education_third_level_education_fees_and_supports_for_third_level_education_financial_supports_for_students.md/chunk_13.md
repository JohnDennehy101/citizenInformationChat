###  How to apply for the Fund for Students with Disabilities

You cannot apply directly for the FSD. Applications should be made on your
behalf by your college.

You will need to:

  * Register with the disability or access office in your college 
  * Provide medical verification of your disability (for example, a consultantâ€™s report) 

The college will then carry out a needs assessment to identify the appropriate
supports required.

Funding is allocated to the college, not the student. The college is
responsible for managing the funding and has full discretion on how the FSD is
allocated.

The college uses the funding to support your needs as decided by a needs
assessment. Generally, you will not need to organise services, supports or
equipment yourself as this will by done by the college in consultation with
you.

You should contact the disability or access office in your college for more
information on how to apply for FSD and read about [ the FSD on the HEA
website ](https://hea.ie/funding-governance-performance/funding/student-
finance/fund-for-students-with-disabilities/) .
