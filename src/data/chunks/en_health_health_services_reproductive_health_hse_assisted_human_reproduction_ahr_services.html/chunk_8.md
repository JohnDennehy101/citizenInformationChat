###  **Step 3: Appointment with a consultant**

The reproductive medicine consultant at the Regional Fertility Hub will review
your medical test results, all your medical history and discuss your treatment
options.

If you are applying as a couple, you must both attend this appointment.

Depending on the results of your tests, your consultant may recommend:

  * Medical treatments such as timed intercourse or ovulation induction 
  * Surgery (for women or for men) 
  * Assisted conception treatment, including IUI, ICSI and IVF
