##  Introduction

Getting pregnant can be a challenge for some people. You can read our overview
page about [ fertility treatments and assisted human reproduction
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/birth-family-relationships/before-
your-baby-is-born/fertility-treatments-and-dahr/) in Ireland.

[ Since 25 September 2023 ](https://www.gov.ie/en/press-
release/c2e96-minister-for-health-announces-full-funding-for-assisted-human-
reproduction-treatment-from-september/) , you can access free assisted human
reproduction services (including IVF) from the Health Service Executive (HSE)
at a HSE-approved private fertility clinic of your choice. Free fertility
treatment through the HSE is not means tested.

To access the publicly funded treatment, you must first consult with your GP.

If eligible, they may refer you for fertility assessment at a Regional
Fertility Hub. After assessment, they may refer you to the publicly funded
assisted human reproductive treatment (see steps below).

If you are not eligible for this service, your family doctor (GP) may refer
you to a private specialist or clinic, or you may be able to contact a clinic
directly for an appointment.
