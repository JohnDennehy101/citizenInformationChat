###  **Step 1: Referral to Regional Fertility Hub**

If you have fertility difficulties, you must meet certain criteria to get a
referral from your GP or consultant to a Regional Fertility Hub. You cannot
refer yourself.

Regional Fertility Hubs are based in certain public maternity hospital
networks across the country ( [ Regional Fertility Hub locations
](https://www2.hse.ie/pregnancy-birth/trying-for-a-baby/your-fertility/using-
fertility-services/) ). Regional Fertility Hubs provide tests and treatments
for both males and females (see below).

To get a referral from your GP or consultant to a Regional Fertility Hub, you
must:

  * Have problems getting pregnant or a health problem that affects fertility 
  * Be aged under 43 if you are a woman or aged under 60 if you are a man 
  * Have a BMI (body mass index) of 18.5 to 35 if you are a woman
