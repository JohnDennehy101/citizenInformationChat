###  **Step 5: Referral to a HSE approved private AHR clinic**

The Regional Fertility Hub will send your medical history and test results to
the private AHR clinic.

Your private AHR clinic will prescribe you medicine as part of your fertility
treatment plan. You will not have to pay for this medicine if you have a [
medical card ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/health/medical-cards-and-
gp-visit-cards/medical-card/) . If you do not have a medical card, you may be
able to get some of your medicine covered by the [ Drugs Payment Scheme
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/health/drugs-and-medicines/drugs-
payment-scheme/) card.

You can read more about the processes of IVF, ICSI and IUI on our page about [
fertility treatments and assisted human reproduction in Ireland.
