###  Subsequent application

If you have been refused international protection but you want to apply again,
you may be able to make a subsequent application. You must first apply for the
Ministerâ€™s permission to make a subsequent application.

To qualify, there must be new information since your previous application,
making it more likely that you will qualify for international protection. You
must have been unable to present this information in your previous
application.

If the Minister allows you to make a subsequent application, you should do
this within 10 working days.

If the Minister does not allow you to make a subsequent application, you can
appeal this refusal within 10 working days from the date you were notified.
The decision in this appeal will be made without an oral hearing.
