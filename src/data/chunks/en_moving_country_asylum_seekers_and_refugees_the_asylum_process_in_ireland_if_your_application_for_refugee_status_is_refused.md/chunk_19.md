##  Outcome of your appeal

You and your solicitor will be notified in writing of the decision of the
International Protection Appeals Tribunal. A copy of the decision will be
forwarded to the Minister for Justice.

If the Tribunal decides you should be granted international protection, the
Minister will usually give you a refugee or a subsidiary protection.

If you appeal is not allowed, you may be able to apply to the High Court for a
[ judicial review ](/en/government-in-ireland/how-government-works/standards-
and-accountability/judicial-review-public-decisions/) of how the decision was
made. You should get legal advice about this.
