###  Late appeals

If your appeal is late, you should include a request for an extension and
explain the reasons why your appeal is late. If IPAT gets a late appeal
without a request for an extension, it will write to you to tell you that your
appeal is late. You can request an extension (setting out the reasons why your
appeal is late) within 3 days of getting this notification.

IPAT will only grant the extension if you have shown that there were special
circumstances that prevented you from appealing on time, and it would be in
the interests of justice to allow the extension.

If IPAT does not grant you an extension, it will reject your appeal.
