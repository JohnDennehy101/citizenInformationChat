##  If you are a recent graduate

Only one-year full-time and 2-year part-time ICT skills conversion courses are
open to recent graduates.

However, to participate on a NFQ level 9 (post-graduate) course, it must be at
least one year since you completed your full-time undergraduate degree course
(level 8).
