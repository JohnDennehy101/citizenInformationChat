##  What is Springboard+?

Springboard+ provides free higher education courses if:

  * You are unemployed 
  * You are looking to return to work 

You can also apply for a Springboard+ course if you are working, but you must
pay a 10% contribution towards the course fee (level 6 courses are free).
