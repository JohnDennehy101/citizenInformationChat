##  Introduction

To qualify for [ Jobseeker’s Allowance (JA)
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/social-welfare-
payments/unemployed-people/jobseekers-allowance/) you must satisfy a mean
test. In a means test, the Department of Social Protection (DSP) examines all
your sources of income to test if they are under a certain amount. If they are
under that amount, you will get Jobseeker’s Allowance. The amount of
Jobseeker’s Allowance you get depends on your income level.

In the means test for Jobseeker’s Allowance, your **household income** is
assessed. If you are married, in a civil partnership or cohabiting, the DSP
also assesses your spouse, civil partner or cohabitant’s income. Sometimes a
certain amount of income, or income from certain sources, are not taken into
account. This is called an ‘income disregard’.

The means test examines the following types of income:

  * Cash income (including income from work) 
  * Property that you personally use 
  * Capital (savings and investments) and property that you don’t personally use 
  * Benefit and privilege from living with your parents
