##  Living with your parents

If you are under **25** and live with a parent or a step-parent in the family
home, some of your parents' income will also be taken into account in the
assessment for Jobseeker's Allowance.

This is called an assessment of the _benefit and privilege_ you get from
living with your parents. Find more information on [ how benefit and privilege
is assessed in the means test ](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-

jobseekers-allowance/) .
