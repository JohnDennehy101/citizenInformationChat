##  Capital and property not personally used

Capital includes property, savings and investments. It does **not** include
the home you live in.

If you own property, or have investments, or any other form of capital, the
value is assessed using a standard formula (see below), whether or not you are
getting an income from the property or investment.

If you rent out your property, your rental income will not be assessed. Any
outstanding mortgage registered against the property is deducted from the
market value to find the capital value.

The property and investments that may be assessed include:

  * Savings in a bank account (or anywhere else) 
  * A pension lump sum payment 
  * A house that you rent out 
  * Stocks and shares 

If you or your spouse, civil partner or cohabitant saves a portion of your
social welfare payment each week, these savings (as well as savings from most
other sources) will be taken into account for the means test.

The formula for assessing the value of capital including property (but not
your own home), savings and investments is as follows:

**Capital** |  **Weekly means assessed**  
---|---  
First €20,000  |  Nil   
Next €10,000  |  €1 per €1,000   
Next €10,000  |  €2 per €1,000   
Over €40,000  |  €4 per €1,000   
  
If you have a **joint account** with your spouse, civil partner or cohabitant,
legally the total amount in the account is owned by each of you. So, it can be
assessed in full against each of you. However, if you are both getting means-
tested payments, your joint account will be assessed on a shared basis or
against only one of you.

**For example**  
---  
If you have €55,000 savings:  The first €20,000 is assessed as nil, €20,000 to
€30,000 is assessed as €10, €30,000 to €40,000 is assessed as €20, €40,000 and
€55,000 is assessed as €60.  €10 + €20 + €60 = €90  Savings of €55,000 gives a
means of €90 per week.
