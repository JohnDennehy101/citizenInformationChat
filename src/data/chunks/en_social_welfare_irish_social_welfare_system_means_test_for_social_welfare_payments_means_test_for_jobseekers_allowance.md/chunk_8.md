####  **Maximum payment for your situation**

The maximum payment you can get is [ the maximum personal rate of Jobseeker's
Allowance ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/social-
welfare-payments/unemployed-people/jobseekers-allowance/#28a767) , including
any increases for adult and child dependants. However, if you are married, in
a civil partnership or cohabiting and your spouse, civil partner or cohabitant
is getting their own social welfare payment, your joint means are halved.

If they are getting their own social welfare payment, your maximum payment
will **not** include an increase for an adult dependant and will only include
half-rate increases for your child dependants - see 'Couples' below.
