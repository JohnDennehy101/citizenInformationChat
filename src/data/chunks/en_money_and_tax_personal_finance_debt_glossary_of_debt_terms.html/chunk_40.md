###  Simple contract debt

If you have a debt because you have not paid for goods or services that are
not covered by any special rules, this is called a simple contract debt. For
example, if you buy goods using a cheque and the cheque is not honoured, there
is a simple contract debt to the seller. If you use the services of a plumber
and do not pay him, there is a simple contract debt to the plumber. The seller
or the plumber can go to court to get judgment against you and then enforce
that judgment.

A range of legislation provides that various fees and levies which have not
been paid may be dealt with in court in the same way as simple contract debts.
