###  Excluded and excludable debts

The Personal Insolvency Act 2012 sets out certain types of debt that
**cannot** be written off by a **Debt Relief Notice** , a **Debt Settlement
Arrangement** or a **Personal Insolvency Arrangement** . These are called
_excluded_ debts and are debts due:

  * Under family law orders, such as maintenance orders for spouses and children 
  * Under court awards for personal injury or death 
  * From a loan (or forbearance of a loan) got by fraud 
  * Under court orders made under the Proceeds of Crime Acts or fines imposed by the courts for criminal offences 

The types of debt that **may** be written off are called _excludable_ debts
and are:

  * Taxes, duties or levies owed to the State, such as income tax, the Local Property Tax, VAT, capital taxes 
  * Service charges owed to local authorities 
  * Rates 
  * Money owed under the [ Nursing Homes Loan ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/health/health-services/health-services-for-older-people/fair-deal-scheme/#5ed1d3)
  * Money owed to the Department of Social Protection 
  * Debts due to ownersâ€™ management companies in respect of annual service charges or contributions due for multi-unit developments (this is the only non-State debt in this category)
