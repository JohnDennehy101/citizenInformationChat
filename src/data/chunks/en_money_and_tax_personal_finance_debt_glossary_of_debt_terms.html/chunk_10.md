###  Consumer credit agreements

A consumer credit agreement is a document that records the terms and
conditions of an agreement between a **creditor** and a **debtor** , where the
borrower is a consumer.

The rules on consumer credit agreements apply to almost all credit agreements,
hire-purchase agreements and consumer-hire agreements. They apply to
agreements to borrow money which you make with banks, building societies,
moneylenders and certain other finance companies. They do not apply to
agreements to borrow money from credit unions, pawnbrokers and utility service
providers or to agreements entered into by businesses.

Agreements covered by the [ consumer credit legislation
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1995/en/act/pub/0024/index.html) must be in
writing. If they are not in writing, they are not [ enforceable ](/en/money-
and-tax/personal-finance/debt/enforcement-of-debt-judgments/) . The
legislation provides that it is an offence for a **creditor** to demand
payment if the agreement is not enforceable.

The Central Bankâ€™s [ Consumer Protection Code
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/housing/owning-a-home/mortgage-
arrears/consumer-protection-codes-and-mortgages/#dcd924) applies to most
consumer credit agreements.
