###  Debt forbearance and forgiveness

_Debt forbearance_ is the term that is sometimes used by **creditors** when
they agree to change how your debt will be repaid, for example, by postponing
some payments or by changing the plan for repayments. You continue to owe all
the money and you will eventually have to repay it all.

_Debt forgiveness_ or cancellation occurs when your **creditor** decides not
to collect the debt.
