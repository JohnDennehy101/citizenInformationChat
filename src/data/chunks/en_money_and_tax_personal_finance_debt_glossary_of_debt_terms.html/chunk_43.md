###  Time limits (Statute of Limitations)

There are time limits (limitation periods) for taking most types of court
action.

The law in relation to time limits is complex but, in general, there is a time
limit of 6 years for taking actions for:

  * Breach of contract (for example, failure to pay for goods or services provided) 
  * Debt judgments 
  * Non-payment of charges such as rent 

If your **creditor** does not start the court action within 6 years of the
debt being due, the action can be held to be _statute-barred_ by the court.
However, you must raise the fact that the creditorâ€™s action is statute barred
and win. If you win, this effectively means that you cannot be forced by the
court to pay the debt even though the debt still exists.

If your **creditor** gets a judgment, then, in general, they have 12 years to
[ enforce that judgment ](/en/money-and-tax/personal-finance/debt/enforcement-
