###  Sheriff

Sheriffs are self-employed people who [ enforce debt judgments. ](/en/money-
and-tax/personal-finance/debt/enforcement-of-debt-judgments/) Sheriffs can
collect outstanding debts from you by seizing your property or goods. Sheriffs
operate in counties Cork and Dublin. County Registrars enforce debt judgments
in all other places. Sheriffs are paid for their enforcement work on a
commission basis.

As well as County Sheriffs in Cork and Dublin, Revenue Sheriffs enforce debts
owed to the Revenue Commissioners. They have the power to collect tax debts.
They can do this on the basis of a certificate of liability issued by the
Collector General and do not need a court order. Revenue debts can also be
collected in the normal way if there is a court order.
