###  Secured loan

If a loan is secured it means that property or goods are provided as security
against non-payment. Mortgages are the most common secured loans. Sometimes,
business loans and other loans are also secured against property.

In general, debts such as bank loans and credit card debt are **unsecured** .
However, if you decide to roll up such loans into your mortgage, they become
**secured loans** .

If the property or goods on which the security is based are subsequently sold,
the secured loan must be paid off before the proceeds can be used for any
other purposes.
