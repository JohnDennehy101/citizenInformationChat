###  Repayment arrangement

A repayment arrangement is a voluntary agreement between a **debtor** and one
or more of their **creditors** , about how they will repay their debt. It is
sometimes called an alternative repayment arrangement (ARA) or a debt
repayment plan.

You should get all arrangements in writing and keep copies for your records.
Let your **creditors** know if you cannot keep up the repayments as agreed, as
you may be able to renegotiate the terms of your arrangement.
