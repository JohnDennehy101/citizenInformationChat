###  Unsecured loan

This is a loan that is not attached to any asset, for example credit card debt
or a personal loan.

If a person does not repay their loan, the lender is not allowed take any of
their assets without taking the person to court to get an enforcement order
for the **Sheriff** . However, the lender still has a legal right to recover
the debt and can do so by taking the **debtor** to court.
