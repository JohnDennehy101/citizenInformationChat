###  Developmental checks

The public health nurse will arrange to check your baby's development at
different stages against a series of "norms" for that age group. For example,
at 9 months, they will check your baby's eyesight and hearing, motor
development, vocalisation and general growth.

Developmental checks are generally carried out at:

  * 3 months 
  * 9-11 months 
  * 18-24 months 
  * 3–3.5 years 
  * 4-5 years (Your child will get this check at school when they are in junior infants) 

You will be contacted by your public health nurse before each check to arrange
a date and time. If you have not heard from the public health nurse, [ call
your local health centre
](https://www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/2/healthcentres/) to make an
appointment. If you are concerned about your baby's development between
checks, contact your public health nurse for advice.

These checks are not mandatory. Examinations of your baby's development by
your public health nurse are provided free of charge.
