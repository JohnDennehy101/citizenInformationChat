##  What does the public health nurse do after you've had your baby?

After you have had your baby, your public health nurse will arrange to visit
you at home and:

  * Carry out a neonatal examination (examination of your newborn baby) and also a maternal health assessment (a check-up for you) 
  * Provide you with information and answer any questions you may have about looking after your newborn baby 
  * Provide information on breastfeeding support groups, ‘well baby’ clinics and postnatal support groups in your area. You can have your baby weighed and discuss their progress at these clinics with your public health nurse and with other mums. 

During the visit, the public health nurse will give advice on feeding,
parenting and safe sleep for your baby. They will also give you general tips
about child safety.
