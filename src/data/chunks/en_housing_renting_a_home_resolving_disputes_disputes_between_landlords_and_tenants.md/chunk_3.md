##  Dealing with disputes

If there is a dispute between you and your landlord, you should first try to
resolve it yourselves. If your landlord is an approved housing body, you
should use its complaints procedure.

Make sure that you are aware of your [ rights and responsibilities
](/en/housing/renting-a-home/tenants-rights-and-responsibilities/tenants-
rights-and-obligations/) and that your facts are correct. It may be useful to
write to your landlord giving details of your complaints and providing any
evidence needed, such as photographs or receipts for repairs. Keep a record of
all contact between you and your landlord, including copies of all
correspondence and documents.

If you cannot resolve the dispute in this way, you may need outside help.

  * If your dispute is about the landlordâ€™s failure to give you a [ rent book ](/en/housing/renting-a-home/tenants-rights-and-responsibilities/rent-books/) , receipts or statements of rent paid, you can complain to the housing department of your [ local authority ](http://www.housing.gov.ie/node/19) , which is responsible for enforcing the [ regulations on rent books ](https://threshold.ie/faq/how-can-i-get-a-rent-book/)
