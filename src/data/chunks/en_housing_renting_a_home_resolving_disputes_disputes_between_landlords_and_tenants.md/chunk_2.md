##  Introduction

Disputes between landlords and tenants can often be resolved informally
between the people involved. However, sometimes a third party is needed to
hear both sides and recommend a resolution. This page outlines how to deal
with disputes in residential tenancies, and where to get help.

Most [ private residential tenancies ](/en/housing/renting-a-home/tenants-
rights-and-responsibilities/types-of-tenancy/) are covered by residential
tenancies legislation. [ Approved housing bodies ](/en/housing/local-
authority-and-social-housing/approved-housing-bodies/) and [ student specific
accommodation ](https://www.rtb.ie/registration-and-
compliance/registrations/student-specific-accommodation) are covered by the
legislation and come under the remit of the Residential Tenancies Board (RTB).
All private residential tenancies, housing association tenancies and student
accommodation tenancies should be [ registered ](/en/housing/renting-a-
home/landlords-rights-and-responsibilities/registering-a-tenancy/) every year
with the [ RTB ](/en/housing/renting-a-home/resolving-disputes/residential-
tenancies-board/) . The RTB provides a [ dispute resolution service
](/en/housing/renting-a-home/disputes-between-landlords-and-tenants#l13c85) .

Residential tenancies legislation does not apply to [ tenants who rent a room
in their landlordâ€™s home ](/en/housing/renting-a-home/tenants-rights-and-
responsibilities/sharing-accommodation-with-your-landlord/) or to tenants of [
local authorities ](/en/housing/local-authority-and-social-housing/) .
