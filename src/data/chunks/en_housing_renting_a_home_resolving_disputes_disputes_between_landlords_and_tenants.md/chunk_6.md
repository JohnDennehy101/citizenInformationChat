##  How the process works

There are 2 stages to the [ RTB’s dispute resolution process
](https://www.rtb.ie/dispute-resolution) :

  * **Stage 1** is confidential mediation or adjudication. The landlord and tenant can decide which method they prefer. If either side does not accept the mediator’s or adjudicator’s decision, the dispute can be appealed to Stage 2. 
  * **Stage 2** is a public hearing by a 3-person Tenancy Tribunal. This appeal must be made within 10 days of the mediator’s or adjudicator’s decision.
