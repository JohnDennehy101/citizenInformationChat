##  Introduction

If you have a mental illness, your entitlement to care and treatment is the
same as if you are suffering from another illness. You have the same [
entitlement to general health services ](/en/health/health-system/entitlement-
to-public-health-services/) and to [ community care services
](/en/health/health-services/care-in-your-community/) .
