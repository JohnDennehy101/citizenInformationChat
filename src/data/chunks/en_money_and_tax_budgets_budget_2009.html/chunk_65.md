###  Staffing of schools

The mechanism used to allocate classroom teachers to primary schools is the
staffing schedule and, with effect from September 2009, the enrolment bands
will be based on an average of 28 pupils per class rather than the current 27
pupils per class. In the case of post-primary schools, the allocation basis
will be altered by one point with effect from September 2009 from the current
18 to 1 basis to a revised basis of 19 to 1. In the case of fee-charging post-
primary schools, there will be an additional one-point adjustment.

The ceiling of 2 on the number of language support teachers per school is
being re-imposed, with some alleviation for the position of those schools
where there is a significant concentration of newcomer pupils as a proportion
of the overall pupil enrolment.
