###  Cycle to work scheme

From 1 January 2009, the provision of bicycles and associated safety equipment
by employers to employees who agree to use the bicycles to cycle to work will
be treated as a tax exempt benefit-in-kind. The exemption may only apply once
in any 5 year period in respect of any employee. There will be a limit on the
value of such purchases of â‚¬1,000 for each employee. The scheme may also be
implemented through their salary sacrifice arrangements, whereby an employee
agrees to forego part of their salary to cover the costs associated with the
purchase of the bicycle and associated safety equipment. Where such salary
sacrifice arrangements are implemented, they must be completed over a maximum
period of twelve months.
