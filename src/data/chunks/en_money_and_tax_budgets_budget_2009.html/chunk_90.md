##  Arts, Sports and Tourism

There are reductions in funding for a range of cultural and sporting projects.
In particular, a reduction is being made in the allocation for the Horse and
Greyhound Racing Fund to €69.7 million in 2009, from €76.3 million in 2008.
The arrangements are being ended whereby the annual payment to the Fund is
automatically calculated by reference to the previous year’s betting duty or
the contribution to the Fund in the year 2000 as adjusted for inflation.

The Irish Museum of Modern Art, the Crawford Art Gallery and the National
Gallery of Ireland are to be combined while retaining separate identities.

The National Archives and the Irish Manuscripts Commission are to be merged
into the National Library.

Culture Ireland is to remain a part of the Department of Arts, Sports and
Tourism, rather than be established as a statutory agency.
