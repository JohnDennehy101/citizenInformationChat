###  FÁS

Over €1 billion in current expenditure has been provided for FÁS in 2009. In
particular, resources will be deployed within the FÁS allocation to assist
those who have recently become unemployed. Within FÁS’s budget:

  * Funding for Community Employment and Job Initiative schemes will be increased by 2%, from €439 million to €450 million. This will enable FAS to continue to support a minimum of 22,500 participants on these programmes next year. 
  * Funding for FAS’s services to people with disabilities is also being increased by 2% on the projected 2008 outturn. A total of €77.7 million in FAS’s 2009 budget is ringfenced for specific employment and training programmes for people with disabilities. 
  * The allocation from the National Training Fund for training the unemployed has been increased by €9.5 million, or 5% in 2009, to €208.3 million. This allocation will, in particular, help workers who have recently lost their jobs, including redundant apprentices, through training and re-skilling. 

Funding for upskilling those in employment in 2009 will still amount to €168.5
million and will be delivered primarily by FÁS and Skillnets.
