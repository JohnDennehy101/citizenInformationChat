###  Reserves, requests, and renewals

If the book you want is already out on loan, you can reserve it in your local
library. The library will notify you when the book is available. You can also
reserve books online using the [ national library catalogue
](https://catalogue.nli.ie/) . You need your library card number and Personal
Identification Number (PIN) to do this. If you don't know your PIN, contact
your [ local library ](http://www.askaboutireland.ie/libraries/public-
libraries/your-library-service/) .

If the library does not have the book you want, you can request it online or
at your local library. The library may buy the book or look for a copy through
the inter-library loan system. This system lets libraries in Ireland, the UK,
and around the world, loan items to each other for their members.

Most libraries have a mobile app. You can use this to borrow e-books, access
the library catalogue, reserve, and renew books and manage your library
account. You can check with your local library if this service is available in
your area.

You will receive a reminder 3 days before your item is due back at the
library. If you would like to keep the item for longer than the length of your
loan, you can renew it online, by telephone or in person at the library.
