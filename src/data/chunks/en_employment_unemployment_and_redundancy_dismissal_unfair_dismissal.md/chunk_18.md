###  Re-engagement

Re-engagement means you get your job back from a particular date, such as the
date of the WRC decision. This means you do not have a right to compensation
for any loss of earnings.

Re-engagement is used when the adjudicator feels the employee contributed to
the dismissal, even though the actual dismissal was unfair.
