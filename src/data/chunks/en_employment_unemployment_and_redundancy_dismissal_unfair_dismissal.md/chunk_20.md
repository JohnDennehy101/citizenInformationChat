####  Your current loss of earnings

This is your loss of earnings from the date of the dismissal to the hearing of
your claim. Any money you earn during this period is deducted from the
compensation amount, and any payment you got _in lieu of notice_ (instead of
notice) when you were dismissed.

By law, you must try to lessen your losses during the period from your
dismissal to the hearing. You do this by being available for work and seeking
alternative employment.

If you have no actual loss because, for example, you took up other employment
immediately after your dismissal, you have a right to get a token compensation
of 4 weeksâ€™ pay.
