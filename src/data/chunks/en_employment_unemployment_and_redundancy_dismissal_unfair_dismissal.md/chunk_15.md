###  What happens next?

At the WRC, an adjudication officer (also called an _adjudicator_ ) will
arrange a hearing to decide whether your dismissal was fair.

The adjudicator can make witnesses attend the hearing and give evidence in
your case.

If the adjudicator finds you have been unfairly dismissed, you may either:

  * Get your job back 
  * Get compensation for the loss of earnings caused by the dismissal – see ‘If your claim is successful’ below 

If you are unhappy with the adjudicator’s decision, you can [ appeal it to the
Labour Court ](/en/employment/enforcement-and-redress/employment-appeals/) .
