##  What is unfair dismissal?

If you are dismissed from work, the dismissal is automatically considered to
be ‘unfair’ if you are dismissed for:

  * Membership (or proposed membership) of a trade union, or for engaging in trade union activities 
  * Religious or political opinions 
  * Legal proceedings against an employer where you are a party or a witness 
  * Race, colour, sexual orientation, age, or membership of the Traveller community 
  * Pregnancy, giving birth, breastfeeding, or any other matters connected with pregnancy or birth (such as attending antenatal classes) 
  * Availing of rights under legislation to maternity leave, adoptive leave, paternity leave, carer’s leave, parent’s leave, parental leave or force majeure leave 
  * Unfair selection for redundancy 
  * Making a protected disclosure (that is, where you raise concerns about possible wrongdoing at work) under the Protected Disclosures Act 2014 

Unfair dismissal happens where:

  * Your employer ends your contract of employment, with or without notice 
  * You end your contract of employment, with or without notice, due to the conduct of your employer. This is known as constructive dismissal.
