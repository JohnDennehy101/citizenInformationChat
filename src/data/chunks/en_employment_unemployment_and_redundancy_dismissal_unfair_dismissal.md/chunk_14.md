###  How to make a claim for unfair dismissal

Bring a claim for unfair dismissal using the WRC’s [ online complaint form
](https://www.workplacerelations.ie/en/complaints_disputes/refer_a_dispute_make_a_complaint/)
.

You must make your complaint **within 6 months** of the dismissal happening
(that is 6 months from the date [ your notice ](/en/employment/starting-work-
and-changing-job/changing-job/giving-notice/) ends). The time limit may be
extended for a further 6 months, but only if you have a ‘reasonable cause’ for
the delay.
