###  The fact of dismissal

You must have been dismissed in order to bring a claim for unfair dismissal.
The only exception is in cases of [ constructive dismissal
](/en/employment/unemployment-and-redundancy/dismissal/constructive-
dismissal/) , where you claim your employerâ€™s actions towards you forced you
to resign from the job.

If your employer disputes that a dismissal actually took place, you must prove
that it did. Once you prove the dismissal happened, your claim for unfair
dismissal can continue to the WRC.
