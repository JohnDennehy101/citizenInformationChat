###  Reinstatement

Reinstatement means you are treated as if you had never been dismissed.

If you are reinstated, you have a right to repayment for earnings lost between
the date of the dismissal and the date of the hearing. You also have a right
to any favourable changes in the terms of employment during that period, such
as a pay rise.
