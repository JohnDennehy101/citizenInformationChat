###  Employment status

To be considered an ‘employee’, you must work for an employer under a
‘contract **of** service’. This is different from a ‘contract **for**
services’, where a contractor or self-employed worker performs a service in
return for payment. Read more about [ understanding your employment status
](/en/employment/types-of-employment/understanding-your-employment-status/) .

If you work for an agency, you can generally bring a claim under the Unfair
Dismissals Acts against the employer who hired you from the agency. Read about
[ agency employees ](/en/employment/types-of-employment/agency-workers/) .
