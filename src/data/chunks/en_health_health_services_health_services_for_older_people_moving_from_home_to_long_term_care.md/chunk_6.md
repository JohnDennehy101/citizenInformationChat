##  Supports to improve your home

You may be eligible for schemes to improve the condition of your home.

For example, if your home needs to be adapted so you can continue living
there, you may qualify for a [ Housing Adaptation Grant for People with a
Disability ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/housing/housing-grants-and-
schemes/housing-supports-for-older-people-and-people-with-
disabilities/housing-adaptation-grant-for-people-with-disability/) .

You can also apply to [ your local authority
](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/942f74-local-authorities/) for [ Housing
Aid for Older Persons Scheme
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/housing/housing-grants-and-
schemes/housing-supports-for-older-people-and-people-with-
disabilities/housing-aid-for-older-people-grant/) to improve the condition of
your home.

If your own home is not suitable for you to continue living there, you may be
able to get a specially adapted home for older people and people with
disabilities from your local authority, or from a [ voluntary housing
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/housing/local-authority-and-social-
housing/approved-housing-bodies/) organisation.
