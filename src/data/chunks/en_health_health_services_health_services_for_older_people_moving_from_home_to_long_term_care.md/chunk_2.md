##  Introduction

As you become older, you may need or want to move from your home to long-stay
institutional care. Sometimes, if you are a younger person with a disability
or chronic illness, you may also face the problem of being unable to live at
home.

However, you may be able to stay at home with some additional supports. You
can read about [ housing options, supports and grants for older people
](/en/housing/housing-grants-and-schemes/housing-supports-for-older-people-
and-people-with-disabilities/older-people-housing/) .

This page gives an overview of services, supports and entitlements that may
help you to continue living at home, or make the move to long stay care. Find
more detailed information through the links below.
