##  What to do before you leave

The following is a checklist of what you should consider before going:

  * What are the visa and work permit requirements? 
  * What employment protection measures are in force (for example, unfair dismissals, maternity leave)? 
  * What healthcare facilities are available to me? 
  * Am I required to have any vaccinations before I can travel? 
  * What accommodation or tenancy rights are in force? 
  * What is the tax situation? Does Ireland have a tax agreement with the country? 
  * What is the social security position? Does Ireland have a bilateral agreement with the country that will allow you to combine contributions paid in both countries towards certain pension rights, including disability? There is more information in our document about [ leaving Ireland and your social security entitlements. ](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/claiming-a-social-welfare-payment/social-insurance-contributions-from-abroad/)
  * Money – you should bring enough to support you and your family until you find a job, including some months’ rent and deposit. Check if you can access your Irish bank account. 
  * Travel insurance and medical insurance 
  * Leave your contact details with someone at home who can pass them to the [ Consular Section of the Department of Foreign Affairs ](https://www.ireland.ie/en/dfa/overseas-travel/consular-services/) in the event of an emergency. You can also [ register your contact details with the Department of Foreign Affairs ](https://www.ireland.ie/en/dfa/overseas-travel/citizens-registration/) .
