###  What you need to know before you go

You may decide to look for a job in a country outside the EU, or the job you
currently hold may decide to post you to another country. In either case you
may need a working visa or work permit before you can start working in your
chosen country.

You should also bear in mind other differences, such as language, culture and
climate. There may also be significant differences in work practices, working
hours and job application methods.
