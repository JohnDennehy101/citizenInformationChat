##  If you lived together but were notmarried or in a civil partnership

Pension adjustment orders can also apply to cohabitants, but the rules are
slightly different.

A court can make a pension adjustment order if a _cohabitation_ ends (this
means a cohabiting couple are no longer in a relationship). However, unlike in
the case of separation, divorce or dissolution, the pension adjustment order
can only be made in respect of [ a qualified cohabitant
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/birth-family-relationships/problems-
in-marriages-and-other-relationships/redress-scheme-for-cohabiting-
couples/#28565c) , not any dependent children. In addition, the rules of the
pension scheme must expressly allow for a non-member qualified cohabitant to
apply for a pension adjustment order in respect of a contingent benefit.

A _cohabiting couple_ is a couple that lives together in an intimate and
committed relationship, who are not married to each other and not in a civil
partnership. [ Cohabiting couples have certain rights ](/ga/birth-family-
relationships/cohabiting-couples/rights-of-cohabiting-couples/) in relation to
property, custody of children, maintenance and inheritance. To qualify for
these rights, you must have been cohabiting **for at least 5 years** (or **2
years** if you have dependent children together).

Cohabiting couples can be opposite-sex or same-sex. A cohabiting relationship
can continue to be ‘intimate’ even if it is not sexual.
