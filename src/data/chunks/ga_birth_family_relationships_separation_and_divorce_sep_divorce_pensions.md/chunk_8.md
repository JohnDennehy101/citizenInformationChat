##  After the order is granted

When a pension adjustment order is granted by a court, it is served on the
trustees of the spouse's pension scheme. The trustees will then make the
necessary adjustments to the provisions of the scheme.

Pension schemes are administered by trustees who must follow the terms set out
in the trust deed and rules without a court order. The trustees cannot change
the terms of the trust and make provision for a person who is outside the
scope of the scheme, even if the member requests them to do so.

For example, the terms of a trust could make provision for a member's spouse
(such as a survivor's pension), and this will be payable to the member's
lawful spouse, even though the member may have been separated for many years
and have a new partner.

The terms in a separation agreement in relation to pensions may not be
enforceable against the trustees or legally binding.

Pensions are particularly complex, so you should seek specialist advice in
relation to the value of a pension. Find [ more information on pensions
