##  Pension adjustment order

A _pension adjustment order_ is when the court orders your pension be shared
with your former spouse or civil partner or qualified cohabitant.

For example, if one person has a substantial pension, and the other person who
worked in the home has no pension, the court can order that part of the
pension be paid to the other person (or for the benefit of a dependent child).

The pension adjustment order directs the pension scheme trustees or
administrator to pay a portion of pension benefits to the non-member spouse or
to another person for the benefit of a dependant. The Court decides the level
of benefit to be made to the non-member spouse and this is worked out by
calculating a ‘relevant period’ and the ‘relevant percentage’.

  * Relevant period - this is the period during which the benefits were earned, that is the start date to end date (it cannot extend beyond the date of the decree of divorce or separation). 
  * Relevant percentage - this is the percentage of the benefit to be taken into account that is earned during the relevant period. The court can also order that part of the pension fund is split and placed into another pension fund in the name of the other spouse or civil partner so that the non-member has benefits that are completely separate. 

If there are multiple private pension arrangements, the court will make
separate pension adjustment orders, as required.
