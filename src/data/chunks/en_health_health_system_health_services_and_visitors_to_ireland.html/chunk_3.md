##  Irish citizens who are living outside Ireland

If you have been living and working in another EU/EEA country or Switzerland,
your entitlement to health services when you return is decided under the [
rules that apply to EU nationals ](/en/travel-and-recreation/travel-
abroad/european-health-insurance-card/) , (see ‘Visitors from the EU/EEA and
Switzerland’ below).

If you are an Irish citizen living in the UK and visiting Ireland, you can get
medical care if you become ill or have an accident during your visit. You may
need to show proof of your UK residency such as a passport or driver's
licence.

If you have been abroad on a short-term contract, you are still considered
ordinarily resident in Ireland.

If you have been resident abroad for up to three years but your [ Local Health
Office ](https://www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/1/lho/) is satisfied that you
did not establish an entitlement to health services in any other country, the
HSE may regard you as ordinarily resident in Ireland if you need treatment
when you return. This is so that people who emigrate from Ireland do not lose
their health service eligibility on residence grounds before they establish
eligibility elsewhere.

This provision does not apply if you are covered by EU regulations in another
country. This provision does not entitle a person temporarily resident in
another EU country to have the HSE extend the European Health Insurance Card
beyond the normal period.
