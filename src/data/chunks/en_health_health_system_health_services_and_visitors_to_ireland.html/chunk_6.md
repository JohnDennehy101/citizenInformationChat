##  Visitors from countries outside the EU, EEA, Switzerland or UK

If you are visiting from outside the EU, EEA, Switzerland or UK, you do not
have any entitlement to free or subsidised health services. You may wish to
consider taking out travel insurance.

If you can show the HSE that you intend to live in Ireland for at least a
year, you will be regarded as [ ordinarily resident ](/en/health/health-
system/entitlement-to-public-health-services#l2b820) and will be eligible for
either free or subsidised health services. The HSE may look for evidence that
you are legally entitled to live here for at least a year.

Your dependents must show that they also intend to live here for at least a
year to be regarded as ordinarily resident in Ireland. They are not
automatically regarded as ordinarily resident based on your eligibility.
