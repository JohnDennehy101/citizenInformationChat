##  Introduction

If you are visiting Ireland, you may be entitled to health services that are
free or subsidised, depending on your circumstances. This page explains what
public health services you can access in Ireland as a visitor.

Your [ entitlement to health services ](/en/health/health-system/entitlement-
to-public-health-services/) is mainly based on residency and means, rather
than on your payment of tax or [ Pay Related Social Insurance (PRSI)
](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/social-insurance-prsi/social-
insurance/) . There are some exceptions and these are described below.

If you come to live, work or study in Ireland and intend to stay for at least
one year or retire to Ireland, you are likely to be regarded as living here (
_ordinarily resident_ is the legal term) and to come under the rules as
described in [ Entitlement to health services ](/en/health/health-
system/entitlement-to-public-health-services/) .

Some visitors to Ireland are not entitled to free or subsidised public health
services except in cases of hardship. For example, visitors from outside the
EU/EEA, Switzerland and the United Kingdom (UK). In general, if they have to
use health services, they must pay the full cost of those services.

You can access [ videos in 17 different languages from the Health Service
Executive ](https://www.hse.ie/eng/services/mhml/) that give information on
health topics such as how the Irish health system works, accessing different
types of health care, free health services, and information on pregnancy, new-
born and maternal health.
