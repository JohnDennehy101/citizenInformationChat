##  Can I postpone it or end it early?

The agreement you sign with your employer about taking carer’s leave is
flexible. This means you can change your arrangements to take carer’s leave.
Even if you have already started your leave, you can postpone all or some of
it until later, cut it short or change the arrangements.

You and your employer must both agree to the change. Then you can add the
changes to the carer’s leave agreement and sign it again. Your employer should
keep the amended agreement and give you a copy.

Carer’s leave can end in the following circumstances:

  * The person being cared for no longer needs full-time care and attention 
  * You are no longer able to provide full-time care and attention 
  * The person being cared for dies. If this happens, your carer’s leave will end 6 weeks after the death or on the date specified in the agreement with your employer – whichever is earlier 
  * Your employer thinks that you, or the person receiving the care, no longer meet the conditions for carer’s leave. In this case, the employer can ask the DSP to decide on the issue 
  * At a date agreed between you and your employer
