##  How long is carer’s leave?

You can apply to take carer’s leave in one continuous period of up to 104
weeks or for a number of shorter periods that add up to a maximum of 104
weeks.

If you do not take carer’s leave in one continuous period, there must be a gap
of at least 6 weeks between each period of carer’s leave.

The minimum period of carer’s leave you can take is 13 weeks. If you apply for
a period of less than 13 weeks, your employer can refuse (if they have good
reason). If your employer refuses this leave, they must explain why in
writing.

However, you and your employer may agree arrangements for carer’s leave which
suit you better.

You must give your employer at least 6 weeks’ notice that you plan to take
carer’s leave – see ‘How to apply’ below.
