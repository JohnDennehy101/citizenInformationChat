###  What happens to my PRSI record?

If you are getting Carer’s Benefit or Carer’s Allowance, you will get [
credited social insurance contributions (called credits) ](/en/social-
welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/social-insurance-prsi/credited-social-
insurance-contributions/) . If you are on carer’s leave but do not get Carer’s
Benefit or Carer’s Allowance, you can apply to get [ PRSI credits
](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/social-insurance-
prsi/credited-social-insurance-contributions/) . Getting PRSI credits means
you will continue to qualify for social welfare benefits.
