##  How to apply for carer's leave

**1\. Apply to the DSP**

The DSP must confirm that the person you will be caring for needs that care.
The first step to getting carer’s leave is to complete the [ application form
for Carer's Benefit (pdf)
](https://assets.gov.ie/19923/2847745f86944188b90be0e885bf4a01.pdf) .

The GP of the person you will be caring for must complete part of the form. If
the person is under 16 and Domiciliary Carer’s Allowance is being paid for
them, the GP does not need to complete part of the form.

Your employer must also fill in part of this form to confirm that you are an
employee.

If you are applying for Carer's Benefit for a second person you should use the
[ application form CARB2 (pdf)
](https://assets.gov.ie/73468/4c7792255472461b87e546dc5bfd5a56.pdf) .

Send the completed application form to the Carer’s Benefit Section at the DSP.
See ‘Where to apply’ below.

The DSP will decide whether or not the person needs full-time care and
attention, following the advice of the GP. They will also decide whether you
qualify for Carer’s Benefit.

If you are unhappy about the DSP’s decision, you can [ appeal this decision

**2\. Apply to your employer**

At least 6 weeks before you plan to take carer’s leave from employment, you
must apply formally in writing to your employer for this leave. In exceptional
or emergency situations where you cannot give 6 weeks’ notice, you should give
notice as soon as possible.

In your letter you must state:

  * You want to take carer’s leave under the Carer’s Leave Act 2001 
  * The date you want to start the carer’s leave 
  * The way in which you intend to take this leave (that is, in one block, or in a series of shorter blocks) 
  * You have asked the DSP to confirm that the person you will be caring for needs this care
