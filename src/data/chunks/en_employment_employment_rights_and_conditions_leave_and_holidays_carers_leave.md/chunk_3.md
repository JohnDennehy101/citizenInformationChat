##  Who can get carer's leave?

To get carerâ€™s leave, you must have worked for your employer for 12 months
without a break in employment.

The person you will be caring for must need full-time care and attention. A
deciding officer of the DSP will decide whether they need this care after
checking with their GP.

The person must need someone with them at all times to either:

  * Keep them safe and help them throughout the day with their normal personal needs, such as eating, drinking, washing and dressing 
  * Protect them from being a danger to themselves 

The person you care for does not have to be a family member or spouse, but can
be a friend or colleague.
