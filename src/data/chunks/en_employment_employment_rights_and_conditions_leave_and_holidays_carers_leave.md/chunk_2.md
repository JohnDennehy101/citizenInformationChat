##  What is carer's leave?

Carer’s leave allows employees to leave work temporarily to provide full-time
care and attention for someone who needs it.

You can take carer’s leave for a minimum of 13 weeks and up to a maximum of
104 weeks. If you ask to take less than 13 weeks’ carer’s leave, your employer
can refuse your request. See ‘How long is carer’s leave?’ below.

Carer’s leave from employment is unpaid but your job will be kept open until
your return.

If you have enough PRSI contributions, you may qualify for [ Carer's Benefit
](/en/social-welfare/carers/carers-benefit/) . If you cannot get Carer’s
Benefit, you may qualify for [ Carer's Allowance ](/en/social-
welfare/carers/carers-allowance/) which is a means-tested payment. You can
take carer's leave even if you do not qualify for these payments.
