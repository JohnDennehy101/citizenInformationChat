##  How much will I be paid during carer’s leave?

Your employer does not pay you while you are on carer’s leave. However, if you
have enough PRSI contributions, you can apply for [ Carer’s Benefit
](/en/social-welfare/carers/carers-benefit/) . If you do not have enough PRSI
contributions, you can apply for a means-tested [ Carer’s Allowance
](/en/social-welfare/carers/carers-allowance/) .
