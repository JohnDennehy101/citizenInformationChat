###  Confirming carer’s leave

You and your employer must sign a document confirming the arrangement for
carer’s leave at least 2 weeks before you begin the leave. This agreement
(called the confirmation document) must include:

  * The date when you wish to start your carer’s leave 
  * How long it will last 
  * How you will take it (in one block or in more than one block) 

Your employer keeps this document and must give you a copy of it.
