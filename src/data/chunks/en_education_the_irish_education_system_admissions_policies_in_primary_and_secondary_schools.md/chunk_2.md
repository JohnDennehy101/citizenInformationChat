##  Introduction

In Ireland, students usually attend their local school but you can apply for
your child to attend any school in the country.

You can send your child to the school of your choice, provided there is a
place available for them.

Where there is a shortage of places, the school must give priority based on
their admissions policy and Annual Admission Notice. These must be approved by
the school’s [ board of management ](/en/education/primary-and-post-primary-
education/going-to-primary-school/boards-of-management/) . They should be
published on the school’s website and available in writing to you when you ask
for them.
