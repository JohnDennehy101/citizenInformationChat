##  How schools select and prioritise students who apply

In general, schools must accept all students who apply to them unless they get
more applications than there are places (in other words, if the school is
over-subscribed).

All schools must have an admissions policy. This outlines the rules that are
applied if the school is over-subscribed. These selection rules help the
school decide which students to accept and in what order.

Schools cannot discriminate on any of the following grounds:

  * Gender 
  * Civil status 
  * Family status 
  * Sexual orientation 
  * Religion 
  * Disability 
  * Race 
  * Membership of the Traveller community 
  * Special educational needs 

There are some exceptions to these rules:

**Gender**

If a school admits only students of one gender (such as an all-girls or all-
boys school), it does not have to accept a student of a different gender.

**Religious ethos**

Many schools in Ireland promote certain religious values. These schools are
not allowed to discriminate by admitting students of a particular religion in
preference to others, except in the following circumstances:

  * If a school aims to promote certain religious values, it can refuse to admit a student who is not of that religious denomination if it can prove that the refusal is essential to maintain the ethos of the school. 
  * If a school provides religious instruction or education in a minority religion, it can prioritise a student of that religion who wants to attend a school that provides religious instruction or education consistent with, or similar to, their religious beliefs 

Students have the right to attend a religious school without getting any
religious instruction.
