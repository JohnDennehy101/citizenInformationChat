##  What happens if my child is not acceptedinto a school?

If your child is not accepted into a school you have applied to, the school
should write to you and give you the reason or reasons for the refusal. It
should also give you information about your child’s place on the waiting list
and explain your child’s ranking against the school’s selection criteria.

The school may recommend another suitable school for you to apply to if they
cannot accept your child.

If you have difficulty finding a place for your child in a local school,
contact the [ Educational Welfare Service of Tusla – the Child and Family
Agency ](http://www.tusla.ie/services/educational-welfare-services) on
01-7718500.
