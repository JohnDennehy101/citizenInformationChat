###  Driving in the EU

In general, if you buy a motor insurance policy from an EU-based insurance
company you will have the [ minimum compulsory level of insurance
](https://ec.europa.eu/info/business-economy-euro/banking-and-
finance/insurance-and-pensions/motor-insurance_en) required to drive in any EU
country. However, you should always tell your insurance company if you plan to
take your vehicle abroad and check with them what exactly is covered on your
policy.

You can usually take your car for up to 31 days to another EU member state for
no extra charge. Your existing cover can be extended for stays of up to 60 or
90 days duration but you may have to pay an additional fee for this cover. You
can pay for additional forms cover while driving abroad, such as break down
assistance.
