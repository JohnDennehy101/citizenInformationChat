##  Introduction

You [ must have motor insurance
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1961/act/24/section/56/enacted/en/html#sec56)
to drive your vehicle on Irish roads.

Motor insurance is meant to protect you against liability [ in an accident
](/en/travel-and-recreation/motoring/motor-accidents/) . It will cover the
costs of the other driver's property and injuries if you are found at fault
for an accident. If you are involved in an accident and found not to be at
fault, the insurance of the responsible party will cover your costs.

When you buy a motor insurance policy from an insurance company, you will get
an insurance disc and a certificate of insurance. You [ must clearly display a
current insurance disc
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1984/si/355/made/en/print) on your
vehicle at all times when driving.

You don't need to provide your car insurance details anymore. The Motor
Insurers' Bureau of Ireland manages the Irish Motor Insurance Database (IMID).
The database contains policy holder and vehicle registration details provided
by insurers, brokers, fleet owners, and traders. An Garda Síochána uses this
database to enforce motor insurance requirements.

This page aims to provide practical guidance and advice on how motor insurance
works in Ireland.

It includes information on:

  * Types of insurance cover 
  * Cost of insurance cover 
  * How to shop for insurance 
  * Motor insurance and driving abroad
