###  Accidents involving an uninsured driver

In the case of accidents with uninsured or untraced drivers, the [ Motor
Insurersâ€™ Bureau of Ireland (MIBI) ](https://www.mibi.ie/) is the body which
compensates the victims.

At the same time, any claim for personal injury must be sent to the [ Injuries
Resolution Board ](https://www.piab.ie/) . This is the statutory body which
provides independent assessment of personal injury compensation for victims of
workplace, motor and public liability accidents.
