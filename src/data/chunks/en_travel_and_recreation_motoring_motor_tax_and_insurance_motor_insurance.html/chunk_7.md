###  Driving without insurance

Failure to have motor insurance or driving without insurance in Ireland is
generally punishable by:

  * A fine of up to €5,000 
  * 5 penalty points; and 
  * At the discretion of the court, a term of imprisonment not exceeding 6 months. 

The court may decide that you will be disqualified from driving instead of
incurring penalty points. In that case, you will be disqualified for 2 years
or more for a first offence and 4 years or more in the case of a second
offence committed within 3 years of the first.

You should note that where a member of An Garda Síochána believes that a
vehicle registered in Ireland (or outside Ireland) is being used in a public
place without insurance, the vehicle may be impounded.
