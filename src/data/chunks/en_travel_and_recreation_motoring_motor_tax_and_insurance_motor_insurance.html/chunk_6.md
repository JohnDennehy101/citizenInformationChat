###  Comprehensive

Comprehensive insurance is, in most cases, the most expensive coverage on the
market. It provides the same cover as third party fire and theft; however, it
also allows you to claim for accidental damage to your own vehicle, no matter
who is to blame in the case of a collision.

Although comprehensive insurance generally provides you with the most cover in
the event of an accident, such policies typically only cover the cost of
damage to the vehicle and do not compensate drivers for injuries to their
person.
