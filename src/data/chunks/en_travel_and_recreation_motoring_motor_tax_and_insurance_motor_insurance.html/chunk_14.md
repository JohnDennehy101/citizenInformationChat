###  Young Drivers

If you are a young driver, you should consider joining a parent's insurance
policy as a named driver. This will enable you to establish a safety record
and may reduce the cost of your premium in the future. Some companies offer
discounts to young people seeking insurance in their own name if they have
been a named driver.

However, you must not engage in the practice of ‘fronting’; that is, where the
main driver of a vehicle (typically a son or daughter) declares a more
experienced driver as the main driver (usually a parent) to reduce the cost of
their insurance premium. Fronting is illegal and can result in the
cancellation of your motor insurance policy or a fraud conviction.
