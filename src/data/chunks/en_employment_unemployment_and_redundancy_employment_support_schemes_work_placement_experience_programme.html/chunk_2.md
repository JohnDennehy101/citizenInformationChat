##  What is the Work Placement Experience Programme (WPEP)?

The [ Work Placement Experience Programme (WPEP)
](https://www.gov.ie/en/service/95fe1-work-placement-experience-programme/)
gives people who have never had a job or who have lost their job a chance to
get work experience.

WPEP aims to give you the opportunity to re-train and get experience in a new
role, while on a work placement in a host organisation.

You must be aged 18 to 65, unemployed for at least 4 months (if you are under
30) or 6 months (if you are over 30) and currently getting a qualifying social
welfare payment â€“ see 'Rules' below.

Participation is voluntary. There will be no financial penalties if you do not
wish to participate in the scheme or if you drop out.

The scheme is open to host organisations in the private, public, civil
service, community and voluntary sectors.

WPEP is a scheme under the [ Pathways to Work Strategy 2021-2025
](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/1feaf-pathways-to-
work-2021/?referrer=http://www.gov.ie/pathways/) . A previous placement
scheme, [ Youth Employment Support Scheme (YESS)
](/en/employment/unemployment-and-redundancy/employment-support-schemes/youth-
employment-support-scheme/) , which was similar to WPEP, finished in July
2021.
