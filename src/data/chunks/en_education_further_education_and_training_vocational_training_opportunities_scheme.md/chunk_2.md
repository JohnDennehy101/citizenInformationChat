##  What is the Vocational Training Opportunities Scheme (VTOS)?

The Vocational Training and Opportunities Scheme (VTOS) provides courses to
improve your general level of education.

VTOS courses can help you to develop your skills and prepare you for
employment, self-employment or further education and training.

You can apply for VTOS if you are over 21 years of age, unemployed and have
been getting certain social welfare payments for at least 6 months.

You may keep your social welfare payment or get a VTOS Allowance.

VTOS is run by the local [ Education and Training Boards
](https://www.etbi.ie/etbs/directory-of-etbs/) and is aimed in particular at
unemployed people who are early school-leavers.
