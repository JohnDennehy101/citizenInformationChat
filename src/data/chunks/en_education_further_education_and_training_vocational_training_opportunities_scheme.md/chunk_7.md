###  Other supports

People on [ Post-Leaving Certificate courses (PLCs) ](/en/education/further-
education-and-training/post-leaving-certificate-courses/) who are getting VTOS
allowances are not eligible for student support grants. However, this does not
affect any entitlement they may have to exemption from college fees or student
contributions.

There are no fees for VTOS courses and you will get free books and materials
at the start of the course. Depending on your individual circumstances you may
be eligible for the following:

  * Meal allowance 
  * Travel allowance 
  * Childcare supports for your child under the [ National Childcare Scheme ](/en/education/pre-school-education-and-childcare/national-childcare-scheme/)

You can get more [ information about VTOS

VTOS training allowances are not taxable.
