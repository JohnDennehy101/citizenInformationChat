##  Decision on the constitutionality of new laws

The President can [ refer a proposed Bill to the Supreme Court
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/government_in_ireland/the_president/president_introduction_to_the_president_of_ireland.html#l86c0f)
. It must then be heard before at least 5 judges.

A [ barrister
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/justice/courtroom/barristers/) or team
of barristers represents the [ Office of the Attorney General
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/government-in-ireland/how-government-
works/national-government/the-attorney-general/) , arguing the Bill is
constitutional and should remain as it is. The Court appoints another
barrister or team of barristers to set out the reasons why the Bill is
unconstitutional and should not be enacted.

In cases examining whether or not a Bill is constitutional, the Supreme Court
makes one decision, and this decision is final. If the Court finds that the
Bill is contrary to the Constitution, it cannot be enacted into law in its
current form.
