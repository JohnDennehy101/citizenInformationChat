##  Do I qualify for the grants?

The scheme is available to homeowners, private landlords and [ approved
housing bodies ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/housing/local-
authority-and-social-housing/approved-housing-bodies/) . To qualify for a
grant you must:

  * Be the owner of a property built and occupied before 2011 for insulation, heating control systems and renewable systems grants 
  * Have a home with a BER of B3 or lower before the work 
  * Reach a BER of at least B2 after the work and have a BER improvement of 100kWh/m2 per year 
  * Not have already used grants for the same energy upgrades 
  * Use an SEAI registered company ( [ One Stop Shop ](https://www.seai.ie/grants/home-energy-grants/one-stop-shop/registered-providers/) ) to manage the process, work and applications 

**Note:** If your property was built before 1940, you may need to ask a
conservation architect for advice before applying. This is because modern
insulation methods covered by the grant may not be appropriate for your older
building. The SEAI has [ useful information about insulating older homes
](https://www.seai.ie/documents/Energy_Efficiency_in_Traditional_Buildings.pdf)
