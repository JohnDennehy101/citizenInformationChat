###  Rent arrears

If you fall behind in your local authority rent, you should contact the local
authority to discuss the arrears. Some local authority rent schemes may allow
for a rent reduction in cases of hardship.

If you do not contact your local authority about the arrears, the local
authority may start the process to evict you. It must warn you before it
starts the process.
