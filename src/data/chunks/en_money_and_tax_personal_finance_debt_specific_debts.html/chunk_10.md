##  Maintenance

If a parent, spouse or civil partner falls behind with maintenance payments
due under a maintenance order, you can apply to the court for an attachment of
earnings order. If the person is in employment, their employer will deduct the
maintenance amount from their wage or salary. If the person is self-employed,
you can apply for an enforcement order.

If the person lives abroad, you can contact the Central Authority for
Maintenance Recovery. You will need to provide the personâ€™s address.
