##  Utility charges

Suppliers of electricity and gas must have codes of practice for dealing with
customers who have difficulty paying their bills and build up arrears. Each
supplier must publish these codes of practice â€“ you can check on the website
of your electricity or gas supplier.

If you are having difficulty paying your utility bills, it is important to
contact your supplier as soon as possible. Your supplier may agree to:

  * Set up a budget plan 
  * Spread your payments across the year 
  * Install a pre-paid meter or using a pre-paid card
