##  What is the Back to Education Initiative?

The Back to Education Initiative (BTEI) provides part-time further education
courses mainly for young people and adults who have not completed the Leaving
Certificate or an equivalent qualification. The courses are free from some
participants - see 'Free courses' below.

It gives you the opportunity to combine learning with family, work and other
responsibilities. Anyone who has left full-time education can take part in a
course, but priority will be given to those without a Leaving Certificate.

BTEI courses are usually level 3 and 4 on the [ National Qualification
Framework (NFQ) ](http://www.nfq.ie/nfq/en/FanDiagram/nqai_nfq_08.html) . The
[ BTEI ](https://www.gov.ie/en/service/24e75-back-to-education-initiative/)
allows you to study part-time (up to 400 hours per year). It is possible to
get a major award at NFQ levels 1-6 when part-time courses are combined to
complete a major award.
