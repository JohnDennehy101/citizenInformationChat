##  How to apply

To apply for a payment after a death, you should contact the section
responsible for the payment within the Department of Social Protection, as
soon as possible following the death. (For example, if the person who died was
getting a State Pension, you need to get in touch with the Pension Section of
the Department). Staff in your [ local Intreo Centre or Social Welfare Branch
Office ](https://www.gov.ie/en/directory/category/e1f4b5-intreo-offices/) can
advise if you are not sure where to contact.

Enclose the death certificate (if available) or a death notice from a
newspaper with your application. A cheque will be sent to you. Keep your own
record of the pension claim/reference number for future reference.
