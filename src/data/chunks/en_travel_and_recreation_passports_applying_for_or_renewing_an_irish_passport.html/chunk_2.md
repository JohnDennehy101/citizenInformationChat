##  Introduction

This page explains how to apply for your first [ Irish passport ](/en/travel-
and-recreation/passports/irish-passports-an-overview/) if you are over 18.

If your previous passport was issued when you were a child and has not yet
expired (or has only recently expired), your application is considered a [
renewal application ](/en/travel-and-recreation/passports/renewing-an-irish-
passport/) and not a first-time application.

Adult passports are valid for 10 years. If your last passport was issued over
15 years ago, you will have to apply as if you were a first-time applicant.

The Passport Service strongly recommends that you apply for your passport at
least 8 weeks before your travel date if you are applying by post and at least
20 days if you apply online.

The [ latest turnaround times
](https://www.ireland.ie/en/dfa/passports/turnaround-times/) are available on
the Passport Service's website. If you need to send documents, the processing
time will only start when the Passport Office receives them. **Applying online
is the quickest way** to get a new passport.

You can apply for your first Irish passport:

  * Online, through Passport Online 
  * By post, through Post Passport
