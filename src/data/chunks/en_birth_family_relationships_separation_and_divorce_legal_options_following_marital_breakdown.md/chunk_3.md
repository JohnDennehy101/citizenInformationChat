##  Legal options following marriagebreakdown

There are 3 different ways to do this in Ireland:

  * If a married couple or civil partners can agree the terms on which they will live separately, they may enter into a [ separation agreement ](/en/birth-family-relationships/separation-and-divorce/separation-agreement/) . 
  * When a couple cannot agree the terms by which they will live separately, either party can apply to the courts for a decree of [ judicial separation ](/en/birth-family-relationships/separation-and-divorce/judicial-separation/) . 
  * If a court is satisfied that certain conditions are met, the court will grant a decree of [ divorce ](/en/birth-family-relationships/separation-and-divorce/divorce-decrees/) dissolving the marriage. A decree of divorce dissolves a marriage and allows both parties to remarry. 

In specific circumstances, a court can grant a [ nullity decree ](/en/birth-
family-relationships/problems-in-marriages-and-other-relationships/nullity-of-
marriage/) . The effect of a nullity decree is that the court determines that
no marriage ever existed. The law in relation to nullity is complex, and you
should always seek legal advice to assess whether the circumstances exist for
a nullity application. A Roman Catholic Church annulment has no legal effect.
