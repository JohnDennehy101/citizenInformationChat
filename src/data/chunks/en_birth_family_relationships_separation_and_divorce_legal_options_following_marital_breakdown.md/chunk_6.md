##  Mediation

Mediation is a process to help couples who have decided to separate or
divorce, or who have already separated, to negotiate their own agreement,
while addressing the needs and interests of all involved. Mediation helps you
to make decisions to suit your circumstances. If you decide to go to court
instead, these decisions will be made by a judge. Mediation is not marriage
counselling or a legal advice service.

The [ Mediation Act 2017
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2017/act/27/enacted/en/html) makes it a
requirement that any couple must be offered mediation as an alternative to
court proceedings. If you are legally represented, any court application must
be accompanied by a declaration from a solicitor confirming that you have been
informed about mediation as an alternative to going to court.
