##  What is the Back to School Clothing and Footwear Allowance?

The Back to School Clothing and Footwear Allowance (BSCFA) is a payment to
help families with the cost of school uniforms and shoes.

Many families get the BSCFA automatically. If you are paid automatically, you
don't need to apply for the BSCFA.

Automatic BSCFA payments were paid the week starting 8 July 2024.

If you don’t get an automatic payment, you can apply for the payment online at
MyWelfare (see ‘how to apply’ below).

Applications for the Back to School Clothing and Footwear Allowance opened on
**12 June 2024** and will close on **30 September 2024** .
