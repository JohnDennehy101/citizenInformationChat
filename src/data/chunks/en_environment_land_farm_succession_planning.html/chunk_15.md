###  Making a will

As part of the process of farm succession, you should [ make a will
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/death/before-a-death/making-a-will/) .
This will set out how you want your assets to be shared when you die.

It is important to make a will and update it if there are changes in your or
your family circumstances.

If you don’t make a will, your assets will be shared out following the
standard rules. These rules state:

  * Your spouse gets two thirds of your assets 
  * Your children get a third 

This may not suit you if for example, you are planning to transfer your farm
to a child.
