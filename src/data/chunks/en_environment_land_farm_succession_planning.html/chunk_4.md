###  **Talk to your family**

You should also make sure you include the whole family in the process. It can
be helpful to have an open discussion about who wants what before you make a
plan. More than one child may want to inherit the farm while in certain
situations, none of your children may want it.

If you are transferring the farm to one child, you may want to make other
arrangements for your other children to make sure they all benefit. For
example, giving a child who is not getting the farm a site or financial help.
