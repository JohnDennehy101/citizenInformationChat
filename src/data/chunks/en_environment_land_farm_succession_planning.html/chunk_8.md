###  **Transferring to someone else using a Succession Farm Partnership**

If there is no one in your family who is interested in taking over your farm,
you may choose to enter a Succession Farm Partnership with someone else.

You must be part of a registered farm partnership before you can set up a
Succession Farm Partnership. This process involves transferring ownership of
the farm to another person over a certain period.

There are a number of tax incentives if you transfer your farm to a younger
person. These incentives apply whether the successor is part of your family or
not. Read more about this in [ Farm transfers and taxes
](https://control.citizensinformation.ie/en/environment/land/farm-succession-
planning/#96dc34) .
