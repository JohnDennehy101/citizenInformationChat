##  What is farm succession planning?

Farm succession planning involves planning how you will transfer your farm to
another person when you retire or step back from farming.

The plan covers how you will transfer ownership of the farm, but can also
include transferring skills, knowledge, and labour.

This can be a complex process, so you need to plan it carefully to avoid
family disputes and ensure you make the most of any available supports or tax
incentives.

You should also give yourself plenty of time to make the plan, as issues such
as paying into a pension for your retirement need to begin well before
transferring your farm.
