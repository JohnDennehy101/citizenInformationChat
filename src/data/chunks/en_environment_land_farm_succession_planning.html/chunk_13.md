###  Discussing your plans with family and resolving disputes

It is important to discuss your future plans for the farm with your family to
avoid any disputes. For example, more than one of your children might want to
take over the farm, or they might not want you to sell it even if they don’t
want to work it themselves.

If there are issues you can’t resolve between yourselves, you can consider
using mediation. This is a way of resolving disputes between 2 people (or
groups of people) by using a mediator, who is an impartial third-party. This
means you can resolve your issue without going to court.

The Irish Farmers Association (IFA) has a useful [ document on farming and
mediation (pdf) ](https://www.ifa.ie/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/IPAV-IFA-MII-
