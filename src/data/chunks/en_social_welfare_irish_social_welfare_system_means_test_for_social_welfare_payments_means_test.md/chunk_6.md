###  **Who decides if I qualify for a payment?**

Staff at the Department of Social Protection (DSP) will decide on your
application. They will look at all your sources of income and decide what
income, if any, can be disregarded (not taken into account).

You will be told how your means were assessed.

The means test for a social assistance payment can be a complex calculation,
and it can differ from payment to payment. You can find information below
about what the DSP looks at in the means test.
