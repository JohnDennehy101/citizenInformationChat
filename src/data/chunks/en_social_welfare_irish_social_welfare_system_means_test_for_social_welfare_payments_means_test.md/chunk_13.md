####  **Other income disregards**

Depending on the payment youâ€™re applying for, the DSP may disregard (not take
into account) certain income.

For example, a certain amount of your earnings from work is not taken into
account for [ Disability Allowance
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/social-welfare-
payments/disability-and-illness/disability-allowance/) and [ Blind Pension
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/social-welfare-
payments/disability-and-illness/blind-persons-pension/) .

There are also additional income disregards for:

  * [ Carer's Allowance ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/social-welfare-payments/carers/carers-allowance/)
  * [ Rent Supplement ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/social-welfare-payments/supplementary-welfare-schemes/rent-supplement/)
  * [ State Pension (Non-Contributory) ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/social-welfare-payments/older-and-retired-people/state-pension-non-contributory/)
  * [ One-Parent Family Payment ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/social-welfare-payments/families-and-children/one-parent-family-payment/) . 

The assessment of income from employment for Jobseeker's Allowance is a little
more complex. Find more information in our page, [ Work and Jobseeker's
Allowance ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/irish-social-
welfare-system/means-test-for-social-welfare-payments/work-and-jobseekers-
allowance/) .
