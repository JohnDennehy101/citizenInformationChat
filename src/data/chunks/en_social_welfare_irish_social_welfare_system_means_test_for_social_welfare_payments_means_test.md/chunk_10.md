##  How cash income is assessed

In the means test, the Department of Social Protection (DSP) assesses all cash
income that you expect to get in the coming year. In practice, this is usually
assessed by calculating the income you got in the previous year.

Cash income includes:

  * Any income from employment or self-employment 
  * Farm income 
  * Income from a social security pension from another country 
  * [ Maintenance payments ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/means-test-for-social-welfare-payments/maintenance-and-social-welfare-payments/) for you (maintenance for a child is not included in the means test for social welfare payments). 

Payments made to you by the DSP are not taken into account.
