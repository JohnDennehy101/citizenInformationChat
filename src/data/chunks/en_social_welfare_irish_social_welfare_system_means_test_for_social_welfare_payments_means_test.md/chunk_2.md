##  What is the means test?

To qualify for a [ social assistance payment
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-
system/social-assistance-payments/social-assistance-in-ireland/) , you must be
habitually resident in Ireland and pass a ‘means test’.

In the means test, the Department of Social Protection (DSP) checks:

  * If you have enough financial resources to support yourself, and 
  * What amount of social assistance payment, if any, you may qualify for. 

To do this, the DSP looks at all your sources of income. Depending on the
payment you’re applying for, the DSP may disregard (not take into account):

  * A certain amount of your income, or 
  * Income from certain sources. 

This page gives a general overview of the means test. However, the way your
weekly means is calculated, and the amount you can have, varies from payment
to payment.
