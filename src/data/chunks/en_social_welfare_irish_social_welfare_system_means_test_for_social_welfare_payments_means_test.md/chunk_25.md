##  Calculating your total weekly means

Your means from cash income, employment, and capital are added together to
find your total weekly means. Depending on the payment you’re applying for,
the DSP will disregard certain income (not take certain income into account).

For most means-tested payments, the [ rate of social welfare payment
](https://assets.gov.ie/11117/6beb1ad2f51346f4ad6f27db1c473e59.pdf) you can
get, if any, is reduced on a sliding scale according to your weekly means.

If you are under 25 and applying for [ Jobseeker’s Allowance
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/social-welfare-
payments/unemployed-people/jobseekers-allowance/) or for [ Supplementary
Welfare Allowance ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-
welfare/social-welfare-payments/supplementary-welfare-schemes/supplementary-
welfare-allow/) , your age can also determine the maximum payment.
