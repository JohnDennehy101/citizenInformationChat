###  **How the DSP assesses your capital**

The DSP uses the following standard formula to assess the value of capital for
all social welfare payments (except [ Disability Allowance
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/social-welfare-
payments/disability-and-illness/disability-allowance/) , [ Carer’s Allowance
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/social-welfare-
payments/carers/carers-allowance/) , and [ Supplementary Welfare Allowance
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/social-welfare-
payments/supplementary-welfare-schemes/supplementary-welfare-allow/) ):

**Capital** |  **Weekly means assessed**  
---|---  
First €20,000  |  Nil   
Next €10,000  |  €1 per €1,000   
Next €10,000  |  €2 per €1,000   
Balance  |  €4 per €1,000   
  
For Disability Allowance and Carer's Allowance, the first €50,000 of capital
is not taken into account.

For Supplementary Welfare Allowance, the first €5,000 of capital is not taken
into account.
