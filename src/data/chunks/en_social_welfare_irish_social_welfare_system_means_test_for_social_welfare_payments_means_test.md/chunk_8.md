###  **Changes in your circumstances**

When you have been awarded a social welfare payment, you must tell the DSP
about any changes in your circumstances. If you do not, you may be fined or
asked to [ repay any overpayment
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-

may have occurred.
