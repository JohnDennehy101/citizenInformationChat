###  **Income from rent**

If you rent out a room in your home, the DSP assesses any rental income over
â‚¬14,000 per year.

This income disregard also applies if you:

  * Move out of your home under the [ Fair Deal Scheme ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/health/health-services/health-services-for-older-people/fair-deal-scheme/) , or 
  * Live in a Local Authority home and rent a room to a student under the [ Room for a Student Local Authority Scheme ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/housing/owning-a-home/home-owners/renting-out-a-room-in-your-home/#1e7720)

You should check if renting a room in your home will affect any other payments
you are getting, such as [ Fuel Allowance
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/social-welfare-
payments/extra-social-welfare-benefits/fuel-allowance/) .
