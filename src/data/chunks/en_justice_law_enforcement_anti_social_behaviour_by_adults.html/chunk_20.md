###  **Are there any criminal offences relating to ASBOs?**

Unless you have a reasonable excuse, you must comply with an ASBO issued by a
court. For instance, if your ABSO bans you from being in a particular area at
certain times, you may be excused if you are unexpectedly there for a valid
reason, e.g. it is connected with your job.

If you do not comply, then you are committing a criminal offence and you are
liable on conviction to a class B fine or imprisonment for up to 6 months, or
both.

You may also be arrested without a warrant for failure to comply with an ASBO.
