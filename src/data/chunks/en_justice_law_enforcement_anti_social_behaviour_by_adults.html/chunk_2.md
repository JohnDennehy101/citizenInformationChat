##  Introduction

In Ireland, Gardaí can deal with anti-social behaviour by adults through a
civil process using behaviour warnings and anti-social behaviour orders.
Gardaí issue warnings and apply for orders under Part 11 of the [ Criminal
Justice Act 2006
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2006/en/act/pub/0026/index.html) .

If you do not comply with an anti-social behaviour order it is a criminal
matter.  

The [ rules for anti-social behaviour orders for children
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/justice/children-and-young-
offenders/anti-social-behaviour-by-children/) are different to those for
adults.
