###  **Are there any criminal offences relating to behaviour warnings?**

A Garda can ask you for your name and address when issuing a behaviour
warning. If you fail to give your name and address, or you give a false or
misleading name and address, then you are committing a criminal offence and
are liable on conviction to a [ class E fine
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/justice/criminal-law/criminal-
