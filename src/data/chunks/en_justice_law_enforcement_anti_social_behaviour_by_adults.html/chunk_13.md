##  Can I appeal against an ASBO?

Yes, you can appeal against an anti-social behaviour order to the [ Circuit
Court ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/justice/courts-system/circuit-
court/) . You must appeal within 21 days of the order being made and the Garda
Superintendent must be notified. The Circuit Court may extend the appeal
period but only in exceptional circumstances.

The ASBO remains in force until the outcome of the appeal unless the District
Court or the Circuit Court puts a stay (suspension) on the order.

During the appeal, the court will re-hear the application for an order. The
Circuit Court can decide to:

  * Make the same order 
  * Make a different order 

or

  * Refuse to make an order.
