##  What is an anti-social behaviour order (ASBO)?

An anti-social behaviour order or ASBO is a court order against a person who
has been shown to behave in an anti-social manner. An ASBO bans you from doing
anything specified in the order.

The District Court can make an ASBO if a Superintendent or higher ranking
officer of the Garda Síochána applies for an order to the court.

Before the court issues the ASBO, it must be satisfied that:

  * You have behaved in an anti-social manner 
  * The order is necessary to prevent you from continuing to behave in that manner 
  * The order is reasonable and proportionate in the circumstances, having regard to the effect or likely effect of that behaviour on other people
