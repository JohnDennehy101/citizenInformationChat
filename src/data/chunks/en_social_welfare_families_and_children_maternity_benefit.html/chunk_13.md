###  Hospitalisation of baby

You can postpone the last 12 weeks of your Maternity Benefit for up to 6
months if your child is in hospital. Your Maternity Benefit must have been in
payment for at least 14 weeks and you must have taken at least 4 weeks of
maternity leave after your baby was born.

You should apply in writing to the Maternity Benefit Section if you want to
have your Maternity Benefit postponed. If your baby qualifies for [
Domiciliary Care Allowance ](/en/social-welfare/disability-and-
illness/domiciliary-care-allowance/) , you may get a carer’s payment – see
below.

Your Maternity Benefit will restart when the Maternity Benefit Section gets
written confirmation from you that your child has been discharged from
hospital and your employer certifies that you are entitled to restart your
postponed maternity leave.

Your payment will continue until your entitlement to Maternity Benefit
finishes.

**Carer’s payments**

If you are getting Maternity Benefit and your baby qualifies for Domiciliary
Care Allowance (DCA), you may also get [ half-rate Carer’s Allowance
](/en/social-welfare/carers/half-rate-carers-allowance/) .

If you are not getting Maternity Benefit, you may qualify for [ Carer’s
Benefit ](/en/social-welfare/carers/carers-benefit/) or [ Carer’s Allowance
](/en/social-welfare/carers/carers-allowance/) .

If your baby is getting DCA, you may be eligible for a [ Carer’s Support Grant
](/en/social-welfare/carers/carers-support-grant/) .
