##  Community Car Schemes

Community Car schemes offer free transport for people in areas throughout
Ireland without other public transport. The cars are driven by volunteer
Garda-vetted drivers.

These are run by charities or community groups organised by your local Local
Link office.

[ Contact your Local Link office
](https://uat.transportforireland.ie/support/your-tfi-local-link-office/) to
ask about existing schemes or to set up a new one in your area.
