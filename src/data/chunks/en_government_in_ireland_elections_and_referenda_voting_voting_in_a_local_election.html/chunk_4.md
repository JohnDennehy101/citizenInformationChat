##  What do I need to bring with me?

You do **not** need your polling card to vote.

If you have a polling card, you can bring it with you.

You must bring identification with you **even if** you have a polling card.

You can bring any one of the following with you to prove your identity:

  * A passport (either a passport card or passport book) 
  * A driving licence 
  * A Public Services Card 
  * A workplace identity card (it must have a photograph) 
  * A student identity card (it must have a photograph) 
  * A travel document (it must have a photograph) 
  * A bank or credit union account book with your name and address in the constituency (voting area) 
  * Irish Residence Permit 

If you do not have any of the above, you can use one of the following, along
with evidence of your address:

  * A cheque book 
  * A credit card or debit card 
  * A birth or marriage certificate 

If you use one of the above, you must also have proof of your address in the
constituency such as a utility bill (electric, gas, internet).

If you are asked to prove your identity and you cannot, you may not be allowed
to vote.
