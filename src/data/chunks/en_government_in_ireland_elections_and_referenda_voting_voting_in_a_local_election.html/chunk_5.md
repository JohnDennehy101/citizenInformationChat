##  What happens at the polling station?

When you arrive at the polling station, you will be asked for your name and
address. You should also have your identification ready.

The polling staff will check that your name is on the [ Register of Electors
](https://www.checktheregister.ie/en-IE/) and your identity document. Next,
they will **stamp a ballot paper** and give it to you.

You can then go into a voting compartment with your ballot paper and cast your
vote.
