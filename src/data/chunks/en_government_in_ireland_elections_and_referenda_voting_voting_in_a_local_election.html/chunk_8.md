###  How to mark your ballot paper

You vote by writing ‘1’ in the box beside the photograph of your first choice
of candidate. If you wish, you can write ‘2’ beside the photograph of your
second choice of candidate, ‘3’ beside the photograph of your third choice and
so on.

You [ vote for people in order of preference
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/government-in-ireland/elections-and-
referenda/voting/proportional-representation/) .

  * With a ‘1’, you are saying ‘I am voting for this candidate.’ 
  * With ‘2’, you are saying ‘If my first-choice candidate does not need my vote, I want my vote to go to this second candidate.’ 
  * With ‘3’, you are saying ‘If my first and second choices do not need my vote, I want my vote to go to this third candidate’. 

If you want to vote for one candidate only, you should mark the number ‘1’ in
the box next to the candidate’s name.

If you have more than one ballot paper, you must start **each ballot paper**
with ‘1', then '2’ and so on. For example, you will get two ballot papers, if
local and European elections are on the same day.

Do **not** tick or mark any box with an ‘x’ – this will spoil your vote. This
means your vote does not count. See ‘spoiled votes’ below.
