###  Recovery of personal injury-related benefits and assistance

Under the [ Recovery of Certain Benefits and Assistance (RBA) Scheme
](http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/Recovery-of-Benefits-and-Assistance.aspx) the
Department of Social Protection can recover the value of certain illness-
related social welfare payments from compensation awards made following non-
fatal personal injuries claims. The value of the social welfare payments are
recovered from the compensator and not from the injured person who is getting
a social welfare payment.

The payments that can be recovered under the RBA Scheme are:

  * [ Illness Benefit ](/en/social-welfare/disability-and-illness/illness-benefit/)
  * [ Partial Capacity Benefit ](/en/social-welfare/disability-and-illness/partial-capacity-benefit/)
  * [ Injury Benefit ](/en/social-welfare/disability-and-illness/injury-benefit/)
  * [ Incapacity Supplement ](/en/social-welfare/disability-and-illness/occupational-injuries-benefit-overview/)
  * [ Invalidity Pension ](/en/social-welfare/disability-and-illness/invalidity-pension/)
  * [ Disability Allowance ](/en/social-welfare/disability-and-illness/disability-allowance/)

Compensation payments may be made as a result of a court or Personal Injuries
Assessment Board (PIAB) order or as a result of an agreement between the 2
parties. In both cases [ a statement of recoverable benefits and assistance
](http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/Recovery-of-Benefits-and-Assistance-
scheme.aspx#_Toc393459075) must be requested by a compensator or the PIAB from
the RBA Section in the Department of Social Protection using the [ RBA01 form
