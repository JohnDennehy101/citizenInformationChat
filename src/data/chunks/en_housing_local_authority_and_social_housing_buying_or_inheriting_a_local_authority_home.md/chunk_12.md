###  Incremental Purchase Scheme 2010

The [ Incremental Purchase Scheme for newly built houses
](https://www.gov.ie/en/service/d888b-incremental-tenant-purchase-scheme-for-
newly-built-houses/) allows people who qualify for social housing (including
existing social housing tenants) to buy designated newly built houses from a
local authority or approved housing body at a discount. It does not apply to
apartments, flats or existing local authority houses.

Local authorities will advertise if and when newly built units are available
for sale under this scheme. Application forms will be available from your
local authority.
