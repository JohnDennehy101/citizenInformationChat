####  How much will my apartment cost under the Tenant Purchase of Apartments
Scheme?

The sale of an apartment follows the same incremental purchase model as the
Incremental Tenant Purchase Scheme 2016. There are discounts of 40%, 50% or
60% off the purchase price, depending on household income. There is also an
incremental purchase charge applied by the local authority, which reduces by a
set amount each year.

This table shows the percentage discount you can get on the price of your
apartment depending on your income and the number of years until the
incremental charge ends.

**Your income** |  **The % discount on the purchase price** |  **Number of years until the charge is complete**  
---|---|---  
€20,000 or less  |  60%  |  30 years   
Between €20,001 and €29,999  |  50%  |  25 years   
€30,000 or more  |  40%  |  20 years
