###  **General rules for inheriting a local authority tenancy**

Each local authority sets its own rules for how someone can inherit a local
authority tenancy.

These rules **may** include that:

  * You have lived in the home for a minimum number of years immediately before the tenant’s death and have declared this to the local authority 
  * You have been assessed by the local authority for rent purposes for a minimum number of years immediately before the tenant’s death 
  * You have a housing need and no alternative suitable accommodation 
  * The home is suitable for your needs 

The number of years that you must have lived in the home may differ depending
on whether you are an immediate family member of the tenant, or someone else
who has lived there.

So, for example, a son or daughter of the tenant may need to have lived in the
home for 2 years before the tenant’s death in order to inherit the tenancy,
but someone else may need to have lived there for at least 5 years.

You may also need to meet some general criteria set out by your local
authority. For example, you may need to show that you have not broken your
local authority’s anti-social behaviour policy or a tenancy agreement.

In most cases, you will not be able to inherit the tenancy if the home is
either:

  * Adapted for someone with a disability 
  * Designated for older people
