##  Exemption from the habitual residence condition

Under EU law, in certain circumstances, the habitual residence condition does
not have to be satisfied. These circumstances apply to:

  1. **Family Benefits** and 
  2. **Supplementary Welfare Allowance**

The following Irish social welfare payments are classified as [ Family
Benefits under EU Regulations (pdf)
](http://www.welfare.ie/en/downloads/part9.pdf) :

  * [ Back to Work Family Dividend ](/en/social-welfare/families-and-children/back-to-work-family-dividend/)
  * [ Child Benefit ](/en/social-welfare/families-and-children/child-benefit/)
  * [ Domiciliary Care Allowance ](https://www.gov.ie/en/service/30fac9-domiciliary-care-allowance/)
  * [ Guardian's Payment (Non-Contributory) ](/en/social-welfare/death-related-benefits/guardian-and-orphan-payments/)
  * [ Working Family Payment ](/en/social-welfare/families-and-children/working-family-payment/) (HRC does not apply to WFP - formerly known as Family Income Supplement or FIS) 
  * [ One-Parent Family Payment ](/en/social-welfare/families-and-children/one-parent-family-payment/)

This means that they are payable to a person who qualifies for EU migrant
worker status for dependants who are resident in Ireland or in another EEA
state. People who do not have to satisfy the habitual residence condition for
Family Benefits include:

  * EEA/EU citizens who are currently employed or self-employed here (or who are getting Jobseeker's Benefit or any other benefit which derives from their employment such as Maternity Benefit, Illness Benefit or Occupational Injuries Benefit) 
  * Non-EEA nationals, who have previously worked in another EEA State, and are currently legally employed or self-employed here 

You can read more about [ Exemption from the HRC for Family Benefits on gov.ie
](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/fc9c5e-operational-guidelines-for-
deciding-officers-on-the-determination-of/) . People who move to Ireland to
look for employment are subject to the habitual residence condition in the
normal way while looking for work.

If you are an EEA national and can be considered an EU migrant worker, you may
be entitled to [ Supplementary Welfare Allowance (SWA) ](/en/social-
welfare/supplementary-welfare-schemes/supplementary-welfare-allowance-scheme/)
. To be considered an EU migrant worker you must have been in genuine
employment (not casual work) since coming to Ireland. This means that people
who have been employed since arriving in Ireland may be entitled to SWA if
they have involuntarily lost some or all of their work even if they do not
satisfy the habitual residence condition for Jobseeker's Allowance.
