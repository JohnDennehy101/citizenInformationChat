##  Returning Irish emigrants

EU rules prevent discrimination on nationality grounds in relation to social
security, so it is not possible to exempt a particular category of Irish
citizens (such as returning Irish emigrants) from the habitual residence
condition (either in general or for Carerâ€™s Allowance) without extending the
same treatment to all EU nationals. However, the guidelines on determination
of habitual residence address the issue of returning emigrants very
specifically. The [ guidelines state
](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/fc9c5e-operational-guidelines-for-
deciding-officers-on-the-determination-of/#five-factors) that a returning
Irish emigrant who had previously been habitually resident in the State and
who moved to work in another country may be regarded as being habitually
resident immediately on his/her return to the State, if resuming his/her long-
term residence in the State.

When determining the main centre of interest for returning emigrants, Deciding
Officers take account of:

  * The purpose of your return, for example, because your foreign residence permit has expired 
  * Your stated intentions 
  * Verified arrangements which you have made in regard to returning on a long-term basis, for example, transfer of financial accounts and any other assets, termination of residence-based entitlements in the other country, or assistance from [ Safe-Home ](http://www.safehomeireland.com/) or a similar programme to enable Irish emigrants to return permanently 
  * Length and continuity of your previous residence in the State 
  * Your record of employment or self employment in another state and 
  * Whether you have maintained links with your previous residence and can be regarded as resuming your previous residence rather than starting a new period of residence.
