##  What does habitually resident mean?

The term _habitually resident_ is not defined in Irish law. In practice it
means that you have a proven close link to Ireland. The term also conveys
permanence - that a person has been here for some time and intends to stay
here for the foreseeable future. Proving you are habitually resident relies
heavily on fact. If you have lived in Ireland all your life, you will probably
have no difficulty showing that you satisfy the factors which indicate
habitual residence â€“ see list below.

Your [ spouse, civil partner or cohabitant ](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-
welfare-system/claiming-a-social-welfare-payment/claiming-an-increase-in-your-
social-welfare-payment-for-an-adult-dependant/) and any [ dependent children
](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/claiming-a-social-welfare-
payment/claiming-and-increase-in-your-payment-for-a-child-dependant/) you have
are not required to satisfy the habitual residence condition in their own
right. So if you apply for a social welfare payment only you, the applicant,
have to satisfy the habitual residence condition.

The Department of Social Protection has published comprehensive [ Operational
Guidelines on the habitual residence condition
](http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/Habitual-Residence-Condition--Guidelines-for-
Deciding-Offic.aspx) . It is sometimes referred to as the HRC.

You must be habitually resident in the State on the date you make the
application and you must remain habitually resident in the State after you
apply. This provision was added by the Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2014,
which came into force on 17 July 2014. Before this, the habitual residence
condition could only be examined on the date of application.

Since 17 July 2014, the HRC decision on your case may be reviewed if any
relevant circumstances change (for example, if you lose the right to reside)
or if you were absent from the State for a significant period of time.
