###  Protecting your tenancy

You can contact Thresholdâ€™s [ Tenancy Protection Service
](http://www.threshold.ie/housing-supports/dublin.html) on 1800 454 454 for
general support, advice and advocacy around protecting your tenancy.

If you are getting (or applying for) [ Rent Supplement ](/en/social-
welfare/supplementary-welfare-schemes/rent-supplement/) , there may be
flexibility in cases where landlords seek rents that are above the Rent
Supplement limits. This applies to existing tenants and to new Rent Supplement
applicants. The circumstances of tenants are considered on a case-by-case
basis and rents increased above the set limits as appropriate. Contact [ the
local office that administers your Rent Supplement
](https://www.gov.ie/en/directory/category/e1f4b5-intreo-
offices/?referrer=http://www.gov.ie/en/service/40cf48-find-your-local-intreo-
office/) . The Tenancy Protection Service can help you in making an
application.

The Department of Social Protection, in conjunction with Threshold, operates a
special protocol for tenants on Rent Supplement in areas where supply issues
are particularly acute - Dublin, Kildare, Meath, Wicklow, Cork city and
environs, Galway, Mayo and Roscommon. Contact the [ Tenancy Protection Service
