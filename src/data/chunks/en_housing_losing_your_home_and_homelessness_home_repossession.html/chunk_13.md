###  **High Court procedure for home repossession**

The procedure for home repossession in the [ High Court ](/en/justice/courts-
system/high-court/) is similar to that in the Circuit Court. The Master of the
High Court has a similar role to the County Registrar in the Circuit Court.

The lender applies to the High Court for a possession order and, if necessary,
a well-charging order. They issue a special summons, which is first dealt with
by the Master of the High Court.

The Master of the High Court sets a return date which cannot be less than 7
days after the summons is issued. The summons must then be served on you at
least 4 days before the return date.

The lender must file an affidavit setting out the facts of the claim in the
Central Office of the High Court. The hearing may be on affidavit only or oral
evidence may be given.

The Master may grant or refuse the orders requested, or may forward the case
for hearing by a High Court judge.

The procedure is set out in [ Order 38 of the Rules of the Superior Courts
](https://www.courts.ie/rules/hearing-proceedings-commenced-special-
