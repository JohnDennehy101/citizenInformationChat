####  **Fi fa order**

The execution order most commonly used to enforce a High Court judgment for a
specific amount of money is an order of _fieri facias._ They are generally
called orders of _fi fa._ These orders are issued by the Central Office of the
High Court.

This order entitles the creditor to direct the sheriff or County Registrar to
seize and sell property belonging to the debtor.

If this fails because there is no property to seize, then the sheriff or
County Registrar reports that no goods could be found to be seized.
