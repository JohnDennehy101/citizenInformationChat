###  **Judgment order**

The creditor must first get a court to decide that you owe them money. This is
called a judgment order.

To get a judgment order, the creditor will take their case to the [ District
Court
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/justice/courts_system/district_court.en.html)
, the [ Circuit Court ](/en/justice/courts-system/circuit-court/) or the [
High Court ](/en/justice/courts-system/high-court/) .

The court they apply to depends on the amount of money involved. You can
contest the case. If it is established that you owe the money in question, a
judgement order is made.

The person who is owed the money is known as the judgement creditor. They have
12 years to enforce the judgment order.
