###  **Court procedure for forcing the sale of a property to recover a debt**

A [ _mortgage suit_ ](https://www.courts.ie/examiner-high-court-mortgage-
suits) is a court procedure which is taken by your mortgage lender, to recover
a debt by forcing the sale of the property. If a mortgage suit is successful,
the court issues a well-charging order. A well-charging order usually
includes:

  * A declaration by the court that the debt owing to the person or institution taking the case is “well charged” on the property in question. This debt includes any interest and costs. 
  * A direction that the property be sold. Usually the court gives you time to pay the amount due before the order for sale becomes effective. 
  * A direction that the [ Examiner’s Office ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/justice/court_offices/examiners_office.en.html) take an account of all claims on the property and make an inquiry into their respective priorities. For example, this can happen if you have more than one mortgage on a property, or there is an arrangement that some of the proceeds of sale of the house must be used for other purposes. 

The arrangements for the sale are also generally agreed through the Examiner’s
Office. The sale is usually by public auction.

If the sale price is greater than the amount you owe, then the excess is paid
over to you. If it is less, you are still liable to repay the shortfall.

If you manage to make a settlement with the lender and agree repayment terms,
then the lender may apply to the court to discharge the well-charging order.
