##  The standards

The [ National Standards for Residential Care Settings for Older People in
Ireland (pdf) ](https://www.hiqa.ie/reports-and-
publications/standard/national-standards-residential-care-settings-older-
people-ireland) aim to make sure the needs of people living in residential
services are met and that there is a high quality of care.

The standards aim to help residents participate in, and contribute to, daily
life.

These include:

  * Promoting your rights and respecting your autonomy, privacy and dignity 
  * Supporting you to be as independent as possible and to exercise personal choice in your daily life 
  * Safeguarding and protecting you from abuse 
  * Providing you with information and assessment so you can get the appropriate supports to meet your needs
