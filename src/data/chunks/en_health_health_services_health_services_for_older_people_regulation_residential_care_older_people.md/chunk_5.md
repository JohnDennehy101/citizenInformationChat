##  How to complain about a residential service

If you, a member of your family or someone acting on your behalf have concerns
about your care, you should first try to resolve these with the management of
the residential service.

By law, all care providers must have a process for handling complaints and
must tell you how you can make a complaint. If you complain to your care
service provider and you are not happy with the response, [ contact the Office
of the Ombudsman ](https://www.ombudsman.ie/making-a-complaint/make-a-
complaint/) .

The Ombudsman investigate all complaints about public and private residential
care. It doesn't matter if you're paying for the care yourself or it's funded
by the HSE.

You can also [ share this information with HIQA ](http://www.hiqa.ie/social-
care/using-care-services/reporting-concern) .

HIQA do not have the power to investigate individual complaints but they can
use the information to decide whether the service is meeting the needs of the
people who live there. If HIQA find they are not, they can take action to make
sure that care services are improved.
