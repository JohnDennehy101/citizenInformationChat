##  Who pays for a psychological assessment?

NEPS makes a payment directly to the psychologist. NEPS does not reimburse
schools or parents for assessments.

NEPS cannot reimburse you if you are a parent who has commissioned a private
psychological assessment. In this case, you can claim [ tax relief on medical
expenses ](/en/money-and-tax/tax/income-tax-credits-and-reliefs/taxation-and-
medical-expenses/) after the year has ended. You can get more information on [
Revenueâ€™s website ](https://www.revenue.ie/en/Home.aspx) .
