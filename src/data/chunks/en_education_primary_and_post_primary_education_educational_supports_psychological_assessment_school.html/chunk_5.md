##  Who does the psychological assessment?

The [ National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS)
](https://www.gov.ie/en/service/5ef45c-neps/) provides psychological services
in public and private primary and post-primary schools and in related
educational centres.

You can read more about NEPS services in the booklet [ Working Together to
Make a Difference to Children (pdf)
](https://assets.gov.ie/41219/9407bf80d6f54e4c85732884fb535490.pdf) on gov.ie.

NEPS is located in 8 regions. It works with schools to:

  * Engage in individual casework with children and young people 
  * Provide a consultation service for teachers and parents 
  * Participate in school-based projects relevant to educational psychology 
  * Promote mental health in schools 

If your school does not have a service from NEPS they can use the Scheme for
Commissioning Psychological Assessment (SCPA).
