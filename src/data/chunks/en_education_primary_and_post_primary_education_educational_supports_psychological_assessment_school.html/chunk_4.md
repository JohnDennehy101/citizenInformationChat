If a teacher thinks that your child has difficulty coping with the normal
curriculum, you should be made aware of this.

Before getting a psychological assessment for a child, school staff should
consider supplementary teaching.

If the school decides that an assessment is needed for your child, the
principal or teacher should arrange a meeting with you as the parent or legal
guardian.

The reasons for the assessment should be discussed and each section of the
consent form for [ psychological assessment - form 1 (pdf)
](https://assets.gov.ie/41788/9f0a90d1dbdf426bad660fee65c7981e.pdf) explained
before you are asked to sign the form.

Psychologists who carry out assessments must meet with you, explain their
findings and give you a copy of the psychological report.

Psychological assessments in schools are provided by the [ National
Educational Psychological Service (NEPS)
](https://www.gov.ie/en/service/5ef45c-neps/) .

You can get a [ NEPS information leaflet for parents (pdf).
