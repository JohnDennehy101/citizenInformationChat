##  Arrests without a warrant

The Gardaí usually need a warrant for your arrest. However, there are
exceptions to this.

If you are arrested for an offence that is punishable by a prison sentence of
5 years or more, the Gardaí do not need a warrant. They just need reasonable
cause to suspect that you are guilty of an offence. This is provided for under
[ Section 4 of the Criminal Law Act 1997
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1997/en/act/pub/0014/sec0004.html#sec4) .

Other laws also give the Gardaí specific powers of arrest. For example, you
can be arrested under the Road Traffic Acts without a warrant if a Garda
suspects that you are committing a drink driving offence.
