###  **If your home was entered unlawfully**

The Constitution (Article 40.5) states that the dwelling of a citizen shall
not be entered forcibly except in accordance with the law. This means that no
one, including the Garda√≠, may enter the place where you live without a
warrant or other legal authority to enter.

If you are arrested as a result of an unlawful entry into your home, your
arrest is illegal. [ Evidence

evidence/) obtained as a result of an unlawful entry onto your dwelling may be
inadmissible in court.
