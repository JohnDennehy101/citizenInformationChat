###  **After your detention ends**

If your detention period has expired and has not been extended, the Garda√≠
must either charge you with the offence or release you from custody.
Otherwise, any order that extends the detention after it has ended is invalid
and the subsequent detention is unlawful.

The exception to this is if the detention expired while a court application to
extend it is pending. In this instance, the detention is deemed not to have
ended until the application has been determined.
