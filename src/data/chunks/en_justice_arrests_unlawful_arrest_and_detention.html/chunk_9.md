##  Evidence and unlawful arrest or detention

If you have been unlawfully arrested, evidence obtained as a result of that
arrest may be inadmissible (not accepted as valid). In the examples below,
whether the evidence is admissible or not depends on whether the prosecution
can prove the mistake was not intentional.

**Arrest under the wrong provision**

If you were mistakenly told by a Garda that you were being arrested under the
wrong provision, the arrest and any blood sample taken may be unlawful. As a
result, it may not be possible to use that blood sample as evidence.

**Evidence gathered while you are unlawfully detained**

If the Gardaí gathers evidence while you are unlawfully detained, this may be
inadmissible. For example, if you have been in custody for longer than the
maximum period allowed and you make a confession, that confession may not be
admissible in evidence against you.

**Access to a solicitor**

If the Gardaí obtains evidence while in breach of your right to reasonable
access to a solicitor, this may also be inadmissible.

For example, if you request a solicitor and your request is refused, any
statements you make to the police will generally be inadmissible as evidence
against you.
