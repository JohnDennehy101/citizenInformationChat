###  **Making a submission about a** licence **application**

After the EPA gets a licence application, anyone can submit comments or
observations about it for free. You must submit your comments before the EPA
decides on whether to grant the licence. [ Find out how to make a submission
on the EPA website. ](https://www.epa.ie/our-services/licensing/waste/waste-
