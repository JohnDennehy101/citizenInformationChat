###  How does it work?

If you apply to your local authority for [ planning permission,
](/en/housing/planning-permission/planning-permission/) the local authority
reviews the application and any submissions or observations on it before they
make a decision.

When they make a decision, you or anyone who has made a submission on the
application can appeal the local authority's decision to An Bord Pleanála.

For more on making an appeal, see our page ‘ [ Appealing a planning permission
decision ](/en/housing/planning-permission/appealing-planning-permission-
decision/) ’.
