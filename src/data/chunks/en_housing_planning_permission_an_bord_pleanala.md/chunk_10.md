###  Can a decision be appealed?

Once a decision is reached in a planning appeal, An Bord Pleanála will not
discuss the pros and cons of the decision.

All decisions are final and can only be challenged by judicial review in the
High Court on a point of law. In these situations, the High Court will judge
if An Bord Pleanála followed due process in reaching its decision, but will
not look at the planning merits of an appeal.

It is an offence to try and influence a board member’s decision about a
planning appeal.
