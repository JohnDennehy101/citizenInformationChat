###  What do they consider when deciding?

An Bord Plean√°la only makes their decision after they have considered all the
relevant material. This includes:

  * Submissions from the public 
  * The planning inspector's report and recommendation 

If their decision differs from the inspector's recommendation, they must give
reasons for this in their decision order.

The Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage can make decisions
about general planning and development policy and the board must take them
into account when making their decisions. However, the Minister cannot
influence the board about a particular appeal.
