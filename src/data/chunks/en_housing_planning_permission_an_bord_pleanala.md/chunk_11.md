###  Local authority development plans

An Bord Pleanála must make sure that all planning decisions stick to
principles of proper planning and sustainable development. If they feel that a
planning authority has not taken these principles into consideration, the
Board can go against the [ development plan ](/en/housing/planning-
permission/development-plans/) . Generally, this would only happen where the
proposed development is of local or national importance.

An Bord Pleanála tries to strike a balance between environmental and economic
considerations when they are determining appeals. In exceptional cases, they
will take issues of economic development and job creation into account when
making a decision.
