##  What happens when you are declared bankrupt?

A Bankruptcy Inspector from the ISI will serve you with a copy of the Order of
Adjudication (Bankruptcy Order) and Warrant of Seizure.

The Inspector will also give you a Statement of Personal Information Form to
complete, requesting various details, which the ISI will use to contact you
and process your bankruptcy.

Your bank accounts will be frozen, except for one current account in which you
can keep a balance of up to â‚¬1,000 for general living expenses.

The ISI will contact all financial institutions and inform them that you have
been made bankrupt.

As soon as your bankruptcy starts, you are free of debt. The Official Assignee
now owns your assets and administers your estate. Your creditors can no longer
seek repayment directly from you. They must deal directly with the Official
Assignee and all correspondence should be forwarded to him.

You must give any surplus income to the Official Assignee.

Your name will appear in the Bankruptcy Register, which is kept in the [
Office of the Examiner of the High Court ](https://www.courts.ie/office-
examiner-high-court) . Anyone can check this register.
