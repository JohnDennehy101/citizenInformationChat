###  Assets

All of your assets, with the exception of necessities up to a value of €6,000,
are transferred to the Official Assignee, who will sell them.

You can keep essential assets up to a value of €6,000, but you can apply to
the court to increase that figure. The assets may include:

  * Clothes 
  * Vehicles 
  * Furniture and tools or equipment relating to trade 
  * Necessities for your family and any dependent relatives living with you 

Once your assets are sold, the Official Assignee will pay costs, expenses,
fees and certain priority debts, such as taxes, and distribute the remainder
among your creditors.

If you acquire assets after the date when you are made bankrupt (for example,
through inheritance) the Official Assignee can claim them and sell them for
the benefit of your creditors.

If you own a family home, by yourself or with another person, the Official
Assignee may only sell it with the prior permission of the court. Where this
permission is sought, the court will balance the interests of your creditors
against the interests of your family and may decide to postpone the sale of
your home.

If you hold property jointly (for example, with your spouse) your bankruptcy
will cause the joint ownership to be split between the Official Assignee and
your non-bankrupt co-owner.

If the Official Assignee has not sold your home within 3 years, ownership may
automatically transfer back to you, unless otherwise agreed.
