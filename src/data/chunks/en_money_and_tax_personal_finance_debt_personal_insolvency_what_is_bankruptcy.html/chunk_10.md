##  How long does bankruptcy last?

You are automatically discharged from bankruptcy 1 year after the order of
adjudication. Your name will remain on the register, as a discharged bankrupt.
If there is an Income Payment Agreement or an Income Payment Order in place,
you will still have to comply with it until it expires. These arrangements can
last up to 3 years.

This period could be shorter if you can come to a settlement with your
creditors or could be longer if you do not fully co-operate or if you fail to
disclose all of your property.
