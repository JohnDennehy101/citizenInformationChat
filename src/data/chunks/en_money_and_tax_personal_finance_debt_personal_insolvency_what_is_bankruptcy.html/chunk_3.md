If none of these are suitable, you may decide that declaring bankruptcy is the
best solution for you.

In some circumstances, the High Court can make you bankrupt at the request of
a creditor. This request is made in a document called a petition. A creditor
can petition for bankruptcy against you if you have committed an _act of
bankruptcy_ within the previous 3 months. This is known as a _creditor’s
petition_ .

Examples of acts of bankruptcy are if:

  * You are served with a bankruptcy summons requesting payment of a specific sum and you fail to comply within 14 days 
  * The sheriff or county registrar makes a return of 'no goods' when they are authorised to seize your belongings but find no goods to seize 
  * You have been subject to a [ Debt Settlement Arrangement ](/en/money-and-tax/personal-finance/debt/personal-insolvency/debt-settlement-arrangements/) which has been terminated or has failed 
  * You have been subject to a [ Personal Insolvency Arrangement ](/en/money-and-tax/personal-finance/debt/personal-insolvency/personal-insolvency-arrangements/) which has been terminated or has failed
