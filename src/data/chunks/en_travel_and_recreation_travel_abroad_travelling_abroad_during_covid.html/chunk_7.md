##  Do you have travel insurance?

You should get travel insurance for yourself and your family. If you have a
travel insurance policy already, or travel insurance is included in your
health insurance policy, you should check that you are covered for hospital
treatment for COVID-19.

You should bring your [ European Health Insurance Card ](/en/travel-and-
recreation/travel-abroad/european-health-insurance-card/) with you if you are
travelling to the EEA or Switzerland. You cannot use your EHIC in the UK. But
you can still get the healthcare you need. You will need to show your Irish
passport to the GP or hospital. Make sure that it is in date, it must be
renewed every 4 years and each family member needs their own. An EHIC does not
replace travel insurance.

[ Ireland and Australia have a reciprocal health agreement
](http://health.gov.ie/blog/press-release/reciprocal-agreement-on-medical-
treatment-for-temporary-visitors-between-ireland-and-australia/) . This means
that Irish visitors to Australia will receive emergency services and
assistance towards the cost of prescribed drugs and medicines on the same
basis as persons ordinarily resident in Australia.

Irish citizens travelling in the UK are entitled to access healthcare through
the [ Common Travel Area ](/en/government-in-ireland/ireland-and-the-
uk/common-travel-area-between-ireland-and-the-uk/) .
