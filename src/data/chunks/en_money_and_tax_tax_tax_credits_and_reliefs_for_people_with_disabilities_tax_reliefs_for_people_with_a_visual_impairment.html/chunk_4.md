##  Guide Dog Allowance

Guide dogs are especially trained to lead people who are blind or vision
impaired around obstacles.

You can get a tax allowance if you, or your spouse, have a trained guide dog.

The [ Guide Dog Allowance ](https://www.revenue.ie/en/personal-tax-credits-
reliefs-and-exemptions/health-and-age/guide-dog-allowance/index.aspx) is €825.
The relief is given at the standard income tax rate of 20%, so it reduces your
tax by €165 (20% of €825).

To claim the allowance you must have a letter from Irish Guide Dogs for the
Blind confirming that you are a registered owner.
