##  Introduction

It is generally only possible to claim one personal social assistance or
social insurance payment at a time in Ireland. However, in some circumstances,
you can keep your personal payment and get half of another social welfare
payment.

If you are getting certain social welfare payments and you are providing full-
time care and attention to another person, you can keep your main social
welfare payment and get half-rate Carerâ€™s Allowance as well. More information
can be found in our document about [ qualifying for half-rate Carer's
Allowance ](/en/social-welfare/carers/half-rate-carers-allowance/) .

[ Blind Pension ](/en/social-welfare/disability-and-illness/blind-persons-
pension/) can be paid with certain other social welfare payments provided you
meet the conditions for both payments.

You can get a half-rate Maternity, Paternity, Adoptive, Parent's or Health and
Safety Benefit payment if you are claiming one of the following social welfare
payments:

  * [ One-Parent Family Payment ](/en/social-welfare/families-and-children/one-parent-family-payment/)
  * [ Widow's, Widower's or Surviving Civil Partner's (Contributory) Pension ](/en/social-welfare/death-related-benefits/widowed-persons-contrib-pension/)
  * [ Widow's, Widower's or Surviving Civil Partner's (Non-Contributory) Pension ](/en/social-welfare/death-related-benefits/widowed-persons-non-contrib-pension/)
  * Death benefits or survivor's benefits under the [ Occupational Injuries Benefit Scheme ](/en/social-welfare/disability-and-illness/occupational-injuries-benefit-overview/) , such as Widow's, Widower's or Surviving Civil Partner's Pension and Dependant Parent Pension. 

In addition, you must satisfy the social insurance contribution and other
conditions for [ Maternity Benefit ](/en/social-welfare/families-and-
children/maternity-benefit/) , [ Paternity Benefit ](/en/social-
welfare/families-and-children/paternity-benefit/) , [ Adoptive Benefit
](/en/social-welfare/families-and-children/adoptive-benefit/) , [ Parent's
Benefit ](/en/social-welfare/families-and-children/parents-benefit/) , or [
Health and Safety Benefit ](/en/social-welfare/families-and-children/health-
safety-benefit/) . If you meet these conditions you will get half the personal
rate of payment, with no additional increases for children.
