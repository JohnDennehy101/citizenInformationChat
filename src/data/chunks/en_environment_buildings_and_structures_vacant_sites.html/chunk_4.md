##  Vacant sites register

This is a register of lands in the local authorityâ€™s area that are suitable
for housing but have not been put forward for development.

A site can be added to the vacant sites register when the local authority
decides that the property **has been vacant for 12 months or more** . The
local authority must give written notice to the owner, of their intention to
include a site on the register.

The register must contain the:

  * Location of each site including a map 
  * Name and address of the owner 
  * Current market value 

If you own a site on the vacant site register you may have to pay the vacant
sites levy (below).

The register is available at the offices of the local authority and on their
website for public viewing. Since 2017, local authorities must maintain a
_vacant sites register_ . This was introduced by the [ Urban Regeneration and
Housing Act 2015
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2015/act/33/enacted/en/html) .
