##  Introduction

When you apply for a social assistance or means-tested payment your income is
assessed to see whether you qualify. If you are 24 years of age or under and
are living with a parent or a step-parent in the family home your parents'
income will also be taken into account. The Department of Social Protection
call this an assessment of the _benefit and privilege_ you get from living
with your parents.

This means that though you may have no income, your parents' income can affect
your social welfare payment. Some people may still refer to _benefit and
privilege_ as 'board and lodgings'.
