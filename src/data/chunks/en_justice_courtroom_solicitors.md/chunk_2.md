##  Introduction

A solicitor is a type of lawyer who is qualified to offer legal advice and
services.

Unlike barristers, solicitors are allowed to join together to form [
partnerships ](https://www.lsra.ie/for-law-professionals/limited-liability-
partnerships/) and they are allowed to advertise their services.

Experienced and/or specialist solicitors can also [ apply to become a senior
counsel ](https://www.lsra.ie/for-law-professionals/applications-for-senior-
counsel/) and use the letters SC after their name. Solicitors who are
appointed senior counsel remain solicitors.
