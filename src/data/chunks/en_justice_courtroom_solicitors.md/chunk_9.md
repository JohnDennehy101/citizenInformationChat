###  No foal, no fee

Many solicitors take on cases on a "no foal, no fee" basis. This means that
you will not be charged a fee by your solicitor if you do not win the case.
This is most common in personal injuries cases (where you have been injured in
an accident).

You can read more about legal fees on the websites of [ the Law Society
](https://www.lawsociety.ie/public/Legal-guides/you--your-solicitor/legal-
charges) and [ the Legal Services Regulatory Authority (LSRA)
](https://www.lsra.ie/for-consumers/your-legal-bill-explained/) .
