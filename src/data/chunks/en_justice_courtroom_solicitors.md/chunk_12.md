##  How do I complain about a solicitor?

The Law Society sets down rules and regulations about how solicitors may
conduct their business. Before 7 October 2019, complaints about solicitors
were [ made to the Law Society ](https://www.lawsociety.ie/Public/Complaints-
against-solicitors/) .

Since 7 October 2019, if you have a complaint about inadequate services,
excessive costs or alleged misconduct against solicitors, you can make a
complaint to the [ Legal Services Regulatory Authority (LSRA)
](/en/justice/courts-system/legal-services-regulatory-authority/) .

Complaints about solicitors provided by the [ Legal Aid Board
](/en/justice/legal-aid-and-advice/legal-aid-board/) should be made as per the
[ Legal Aid Board's complaints procedure
](http://www.legalaidboard.ie/en/About-the-Board/Customer-Charter/Complaints-
Procedure/) .
