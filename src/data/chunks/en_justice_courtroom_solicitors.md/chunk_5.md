###  Solicitors in court

If you are involved in a court case, your solicitor will manage the case and
represent you when dealing with the other party.

Your solicitor will:

  * Send letters to the other party on your behalf 
  * File all necessary court documents 
  * Contact any [ witnesses ](/en/justice/witnesses/being-a-witness/) called to give [ evidence ](/en/justice/evidence/evidence-introduction/) in the case 

If it is necessary to involve a [ barrister
](/en/justice/courtroom/barristers/) in the case, your solicitor will brief
the barrister by sending them all of the necessary documents and information.

Your solicitor may also actually represent you in court, although in the [
High Court ](/en/justice/courts-system/high-court/) and the [ Supreme Court
](/en/justice/courts-system/supreme-court/) , a barrister will usually be
engaged. Solicitors do not have to wear any special clothes when in court.

If there is a barrister involved in the case, the solicitor will usually sit
facing the barrister in the bench under the [ judge
](/en/justice/courtroom/judge/) . If the barrister needs a matter to be
clarified, he or she can then lean over to ask the solicitor.
