##  Tax credits

Joan is single and earns €28,000 a year. She gets her [ tax credit certificate
](https://www.revenue.ie/en/jobs-and-pensions/calculating-your-income-tax/tax-
credit-certificate.aspx) from Revenue.

Joan’s tax credits are listed as:

  * Single Person Tax Credit = €1,875 
  * Employee (PAYE) Tax Credit = €1,875   
**Tax credit total** = €3,750

The standard rate cut-off point for a single person is €42,000. Because Joan’s
income is below the cut-off point, all of her income is taxed at the standard
rate, (20%), to give her gross tax.  
28,000 x 20% = €5,600 gross tax.

All her tax credits are deducted from the gross tax to give the **tax that is
payable** :  
€5,600 - €3,750 = €1,850

Joan is also liable to pay the [ Universal Social Charge ](/en/money-and-
tax/tax/income-tax/universal-social-charge/) (USC).

**USC** = €424.62. This is calculated as follows:

  * A rate of 0.5% on the first €12,012 (which comes to €60.06) 
  * 2% on the next €13,748 (which comes to €274.96) 
  * 4% on the balance of €2,240 (which comes to €89.60) 

The **total** amount deducted from her annual income is:

€1,850 (income tax) + €424.62 (USC) = **€2,274.62**

You can get the monthly amount of the total tax that should be deducted from
wages by dividing this annual figure by 12.

Or, you can get the weekly amount of the total tax that should be deducted
from wages by dividing the annual figure by 52.
