##  Tax rates and the standard rate cut-off point

A single taxpayer who earns €43,200 a year will have their tax calculated as
follows:

The [ **standard rate band** ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/money-
and-tax/tax/income-tax/how-your-tax-is-calculated/#354b71) for a single
taxpayer is €42,000.

This means that the first €42,000 is taxed at the standard rate of tax, 20%,
and the remainder (€1,200) is taxed at the higher rate of tax, 40%.  
€42,000 x 20% = €8,400  
€1,200 x 40% = €480  
**Total gross tax** = €8,880

**Tax credits** are deducted from this amount to give the tax due. A single
PAYE (Pay As You Earn) taxpayer is entitled to

  * Single Person Tax Credit = €1,875 
  * Employee (PAYE) Tax Credit = €1,875   
**Total tax credits** = €3,750

In this example, the taxpayer is not entitled to any [ other tax credits
](/en/money-and-tax/tax/income-tax-credits-and-reliefs/) .

Subtract the total tax credits to get the **income tax due** :

**Gross tax** of €8,880

**Minus tax credits** of €3,750  
**Tax due** = €5,130

The [ Universal Social Charge ](/en/money-and-tax/tax/income-tax/universal-
social-charge/) (USC) is also payable on the gross income.

USC is calculated as follows:

  * A rate of 0.5% on the first €12,012 (which comes to €60.06) 
  * 2% on the next €13,748 (which comes to €274.96) 
  * 4% on the balance of €17,440 (which comes to €697.60) 

**USC** = €1,032.62

The **total amount deducted from income** in the year is:

€5,130 ( **income tax** ) **+** €1,032.62 ( **USC** ) = **€6,162.62**
