##  Reasons for your arrest

You must be told the reason for your arrest, and this must be explained to you
in an understandable way.

For example, if you are arrested for drink-driving, the Garda is not obliged
to cite the specific provision ("I am arresting you under the provisions of
Section 49 (8) of the Road Traffic Act, 1961").

The Garda just needs to make sure that the provision is explained to you
clearly (“I am arresting you for drink-driving”).
