##  When is an arrest or detention unlawful?

Your arrest is unlawful if the Garda fails to inform you in ordinary language
the reason for your arrest. If this happens the detention which follows is
unlawful.

However, if the reasons for your arrest are given to you at any time during
your detention, your custody becomes lawful from that point on.
