###  EU regulation of harmful or illegal online content

Measures to tackle illegal content online at EU level include:

  * **Combating sexual abuse of children** – It is illegal to access child sexual abuse material online under the [ Directive on combating sexual abuse and sexual exploitation of children and child pornography ](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex%3A32011L0093) . The EU works with governments, technology companies and organisations worldwide through the [ WEPROTECT Global Alliance ](https://www.weprotect.org/) . 
  * **Eliminating terrorist content** – Since 2015, EU law has been strengthened to criminalise online incitement, promotion or glorification of terrorism. The [ EU Internet Forum ](https://www.internetforum.eu/) was set up in 2015 to stop the misuse of the internet by international terrorist organisations, working together with the internet industry to remove illegal content. Ireland is a member of the forum. 
  * **Fighting racist or hate speech** – In 2016, Facebook, YouTube, Twitter and Microsoft committed to the [ Code of conduct on countering illegal hate speech online ](https://ec.europa.eu/info/policies/justice-and-fundamental-rights/combatting-discrimination/racism-and-xenophobia/countering-illegal-hate-speech-online_en) . Instagram, Snapchat and others joined in 2018. Under the Code, platforms have committed to reviewing illegal content within 24 hours of it being reported, and removing it if necessary. The Code is monitored by the European Commission. 

The European Commission website has more information on countering illegal
content online.
