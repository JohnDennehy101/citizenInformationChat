##  Introduction

Under the Irish Constitution, you have a right to freedom of expression. This
is the right to freely express your convictions and opinions. However, Ireland
also has censorship laws, which restrict freedom of expression in certain
circumstances.

Books, films, magazines, newspapers, online content and other forms of mass
communication may be restricted or banned if they are considered:

  * Unacceptable 
  * Offensive 
  * Obscene 
  * Likely to [ incite hatred ](/en/justice/criminal-law/criminal-offences/law-on-hate-speech/) or violence 

Magazines and newspapers may also be banned (prohibited) if they give too much
space to matters relating to crime.

Censorship laws set out rules about standards. The law also regulates bodies
that monitor and approve content that is distributed to the public.
