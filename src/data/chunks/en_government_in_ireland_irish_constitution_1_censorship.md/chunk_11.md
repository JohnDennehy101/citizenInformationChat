###  How are video games certified?

IFCO works to ensure that video games that have been certified by the [ Pan
European Games Information (PEGI) ](https://www.isfe.eu/responsible-
gameplay/pegi-the-european-content-rating-system/) comply with the Irish Video
Recordings Act. Although video games are exempt from classification under the
law, the Director of Film Classification can ban a game if it is judged to be
unfit for viewing.
