###  What happens if a publication is banned?

If the Censorship of Publications Board decides on a prohibition (a ban), it
is illegal for that publication to be bought, sold or distributed in Ireland.
The Board can ban the sale and distribution of books for a maximum of 12
years. It can ban periodicals for 3 months.

If a prohibition is passed, it begins as soon as it is announced in Iris
Oifigúil (the official State gazette). Banned publications are also listed in
the Register of Prohibited Publications.

A ban can be appealed to the Censorship of Publications Appeal Board. However,
the only people who can appeal are the author, editor or publisher of the
publication or any 5 members of the Oireachtas (the Seanad or the Dáil) who
are acting jointly.

The Censorship of Publications Appeal Board may uphold or cancel the ban. It
can also change the prohibition order to exclude a particular edition.
