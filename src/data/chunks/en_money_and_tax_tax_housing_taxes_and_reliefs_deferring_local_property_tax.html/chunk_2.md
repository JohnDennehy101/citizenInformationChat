##  Introduction

In certain circumstances, you can delay paying some or all of your Local
Property Tax (LPT) until a later date. This is known as a deferral.

You may qualify for a deferral if:

  * Your income is below a certain amount 
  * You are the personal representative of a deceased person who was liable for LPT 
  * You have a [ Debt Settlement Arrangement or Personal Insolvency Arrangement ](/en/money-and-tax/personal-finance/debt/personal-insolvency/personal-insolvency-options/)
  * Paying would cause you too much financial hardship 

If you meet the deferral requirements, you can choose to defer the LPT until
your financial circumstances improve or the property is sold. However, this
does not mean that you are [ exempt from the LPT ](/en/money-and-
tax/tax/housing-taxes-and-reliefs/local-property-tax-exemptions/) . Interest
is charged on the deferred amount and the deferred amount remains a charge on
the property.

If you qualify for partial deferral, you can defer 50% of your LPT and pay the
other 50%.
