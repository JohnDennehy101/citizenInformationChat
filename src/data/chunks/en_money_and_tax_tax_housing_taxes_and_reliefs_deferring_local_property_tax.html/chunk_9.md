##  How to apply

You can apply for a deferral or partial deferral **on the basis of your**
**income** when you [ make your LPT return
](https://www.revenue.ie/en/property/local-property-tax/submitting-your-local-
property-tax-return/index.aspx) .

If you have already submitted an LPT return, you can apply to Revenue in
writing by post or through [ myEnquiries ](https://www.ros.ie/myaccount-
web/sign_in.html) .

If you are applying for a deferral **under any of the other categories** , you
must submit the [ LPT2 form (pdf)
](https://www.revenue.ie/en/property/documents/lpt/form-lpt2.pdf) .

If you have been allowed a deferral, at any time you can make a payment of
all, or some, of the deferred amount. Revenue will credit a partial payment to
the oldest period of deferred LPT first.
