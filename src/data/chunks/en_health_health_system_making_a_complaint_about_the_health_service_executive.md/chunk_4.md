##  What can you complain about?

You can make a complaint about an action of the HSE or service provider that
affects you and that you do not think is fair or reliable _administrative
practice_ .

Administrative practice means the way that decisions are made and how services
operate.

For example, administrative practice is not considered fair or reliable if it
is:

  * Taken without proper authority 
  * Taken on irrelevant grounds 
  * The result of negligence or carelessness 
  * Based on wrong or incomplete information 
  * Improperly discriminatory
