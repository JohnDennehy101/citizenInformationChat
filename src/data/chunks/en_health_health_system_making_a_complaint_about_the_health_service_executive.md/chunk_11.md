##  What happens once I make the complaint?

The complaints officer will get a copy of all written complaints. The
complaints officer will be told if you made a verbal complaint that is not
resolved at the first point of contact.

Depending on the complaint, the complaints officer can suggest an informal
resolution, if both parties agree. The complaints officer may arrange a
meeting between the parties or use mediation services. If informal resolution
is not appropriate or does not work, the complaints officer will start a
formal investigation of the complaint.
