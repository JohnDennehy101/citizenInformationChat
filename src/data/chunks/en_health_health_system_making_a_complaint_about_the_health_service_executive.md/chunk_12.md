###  **HSE decision on your complaint**

Following the investigation of the complaint, the complaints officer will make
a recommendation.

You will get a written response to your complaint. You will be told of your
right to have an internal review and of your right to go to the Ombudsman.

You can ask for a review of that recommendation and there will be an internal
review.
