##  Complaints system for service providers

Service providers can put their own complaints procedures in place once the
HSE agrees to this.

The agreement is subject to these conditions:

  * Service providers must comply with the HSE complaints procedure, or have their own complaints procedures 
  * Service providers must cooperate with the HSE in any review of a complaints officerâ€™s recommendation following the investigation of a complaint against the service provider
