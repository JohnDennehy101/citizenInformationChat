###  **If you need help to make a complaint**

If you have a disability and need help to make a complaint, you may be
eligible for support from the [ National Advocacy Service for People with
Disabilities ](https://advocacy.ie/) .

You can use the [ complaints and appeals procedure under the Disability Act
2005
](http://www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/4/disability/Disability_Assessment/) if
you are unhappy with your child's assessment or service statement or delivery
of related services.

If your complaint is about an experience in a public acute hospital, the [
Patient Advocacy Service (PAS) ](https://www.patientadvocacyservice.ie/)
provides a free, independent and confidential service to help you make your
complaint and to respond to the outcome.
