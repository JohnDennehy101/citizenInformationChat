illness or disability, someone else can make a complaint on your behalf.

The people who can make a complaint on your behalf include:

  * A close relative or carer. 
  * Anyone appointed by law or the courts to take care of your affairs. 
  * A legal representative. 
  * Anyone else with your consent. 
  * Anyone who is appointed, as set out in the Regulations.
