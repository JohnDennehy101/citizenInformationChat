##  Complaints system for public health services

There is a HSE complaints system for anyone using:

  * Public health or social care services provided by the HSE 
  * Service providers who provide health or social care services on behalf of the HSE 

If you want to make a complaint about your experience in a **public hospital**
, the [ Patient Advocacy Service (PAS)
](https://www.patientadvocacyservice.ie/) can provide information and support.
The service is independent, free and confidential and it applies to public
acute hospitals that are funded by the HSE.
