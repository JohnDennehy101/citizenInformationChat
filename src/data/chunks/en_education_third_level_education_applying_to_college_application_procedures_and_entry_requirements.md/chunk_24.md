###  Resident outside the EU

If you are (or have been) resident outside the EU, you may have to apply
directly to some HEIs.

Contact the admissions office of the HEI to ask whether you should apply
through the CAO or directly to the HEI.

**Always check the application procedures for your preferred course, as errors
may be difficult or impossible to rectify.**

You should make your enquiries well before the closing date of 1 February,
preferably not later than early December.
