###  Leaving Cert points

Students who have taken the [ Leaving Certificate examination
](/en/education/state-examinations/leaving-certificate/) get points for the
results they get in their 6 best subjects at a single sitting of the Leaving
Certificate.

The points awarded depend on the level of achievement in the subject. You can
use the [ points calculator ](https://www.qualifax.ie/points-calculator) on
qualifax.ie to work out what points you get for any set of results.

The [ State Certificate ](/en/education/state-examinations/leaving-cert-
accredited-grades/) offered to students for Leaving Certificate 2021 has the
same status as the Leaving Certificates awarded to students in previous years.

The number of entry-level points you need for a course depends on:

  * The number of places available, and 
  * The number of applicants for those places. 

The entry level varies from year to year. You get higher points for Higher-
Level exam papers than for Ordinary-Level papers.

Some universities may allocate [ extra bonus points for Higher-Level
mathematics ](https://www.cao.ie/index.php?page=scoring&s=lcepointsgrid) .

The CAO publishes the [ minimum points required for admission to courses
](http://www.cao.ie/index.php?page=points) as each round of offers is made.
You can also check the points required in previous years.
