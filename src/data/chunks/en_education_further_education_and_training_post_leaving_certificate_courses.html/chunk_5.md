##  Who can apply for a PLC course?

In general, you should have finished your secondary education and completed
your Leaving Certificate to be eligible for a PLC course.

However, you may be able to apply for a PLC course if you have not completed
your Leaving Certificate. If you have work experience relevant to the course
or think you can show an ability in that area, you should contact the college
where the course will take place. Explain your circumstances and ask to meet
the co-ordinator of the course.
