##  What is a PLC course?

Post Leaving Certificate (PLC) courses are full-time courses for people who
have finished post-primary school (second-level education) and adults
returning to education. PLC courses usually last one to 2 years.

If you have finished secondary school and want to get further education and
training or skills for work, a Post Leaving Certificate (PLC) course may be
the course for you.

PLC courses take place in your local Education and Training Board (ETB)
schools, colleges and education centres. The course may also provide work-
based experience.

**Courses leading to a degree**

PLC courses develop your technical and practical skills for an industry-
recognised qualification. They can also offer you a way into higher education
and can give you the opportunity to try out a subject of interest to you. You
can discuss your options with the PLC course provider.

From 7 July 2023, you can apply for one of 23 [ courses that will guarantee

The new programme allows you to start your degree at an Education Training
Board and complete it in a university.

**Leaving school**

The Citizens Information Board booklet, [ Information for school leavers

you may have when you leave school.
