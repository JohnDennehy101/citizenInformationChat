###  Rectification outside of the appeal process

If you have viewed your script and believe there is a clear discrepancy
between the mark awarded and the subsequent grade awarded, you also have means
of redress. You should ask the Organising Superintendent at the viewing
session for a _Rectification Outside of the Appeal Process Form_ .

This rectification service applies **only** where it is clear that the total
mark is inconsistent with the grade awarded and where this matter can be
resolved administratively.
