###  PRSI (social insurance) contributions

To get Maternity you must have a certain number of paid PRSI contributions and
be in insurable employment up to the first day of your maternity leave.

Your PRSI contributions can be from employment or self-employment. The PRSI
classes that count for Maternity Benefit are A, E, H and S.

If you are a members of the Defence Force and you pay PRSI at Class H, you are
insured for Maternity Benefit but it is not paid while you are in service.
This is because you will get military pay during your maternity leave.

Time spent on the [ COVID-19 Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP) ](/en/social-
welfare/unemployed-people/covid19-pandemic-unemployment-payment/) and the [
COVID-19 Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) ](/en/employment/unemployment-
and-redundancy/employment-wage-subsidy-scheme/) are treated as if you
continued to make insurance contributions at your normal social insurance
class.
