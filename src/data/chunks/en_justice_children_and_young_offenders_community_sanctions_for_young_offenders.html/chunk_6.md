###  **2\. Day centre order**

The child must attend a day centre and participate in a programme of
activities if given a day centre order. They must attend the centre for up to
90 days. The days do not need to be consecutive, but attendance cannot exceed
a period of 6 months.

Generally, the programme is available in the evenings and on weekends so as
not to interfere with school, training or employment.
