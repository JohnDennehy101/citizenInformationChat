##  **7\. Suitable person (care and supervision) order**

Under a suitable person order the court places a child into the care of a
suitable adult, other than the child’s parents or guardians.

The suitable person can be a relative but doesn’t have to be. The suitable
person takes on the role of the child’s parent or guardian.

The child’s parents must give their consent in writing before a suitable
person order can be made. This order must be for less than 2 years. The child
also remains under the supervision of a probation officer for the duration of
the order.
