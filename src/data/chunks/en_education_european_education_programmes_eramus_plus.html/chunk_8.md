If you are in a school, applications for Erasmus+ must be made through your
school. The school must be fair, inclusive and transparent when selecting
candidates for Erasmus+.

Your school can apply to Erasmus+ directly or through a [ consortium of
schools ](https://erasmus-plus.ec.europa.eu/opportunities/individuals/staff-
training/school-education-staff-training) .

Your school can explore Erasmus+ opportunities through the [ eTwinning
platform ](https://school-education.ec.europa.eu/en/etwinning) and the [
School Education Gateway ](https://www.erasmustrainingcourses.com/school-
