##  What is Erasmus+?

Erasmus+ is an EU programme that can help you travel to experience work, study
or train in another country. Your time abroad on Erasmus+ can be from 2 days
to 30 days or from 2 weeks to a year depending on the type of project you are
on.

Erasmus+ is open to many people including:

  * Pupils in school 
  * Students in higher education 
  * Students in vocational education and training 
  * Young people in youth organisations 
  * Adult learners 

Staff in educational settings and youth workers can also access Erasmus+.

You cannot apply directly to Erasmus+. You must apply through a participating
organisation such as your school or college or place of work.

If the application is successful, you will get funding that usually covers
your travel costs and the cost of living abroad. You may get funding to cover
other costs too.

You can also get [ Online Linguistic Support
](https://ec.europa.eu/programmes/erasmus-plus/resources/online-linguistic-
support_en) to help you learn the language you will use when you are abroad
with Erasmus+.

The year you turn 18 years old you can apply for a [ DiscoverEU rail pass
](https://europa.eu/youth/discovereu_en) as part of Erasmus+, if you are an EU
citizen.

You can find out more about Erasmus+ on the website, [ erasmusplus.ie
