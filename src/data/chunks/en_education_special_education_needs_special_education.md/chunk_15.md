####  **Assessment of Need**

An [ Assessment of Need (AON)
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/health/health-services/health-
services-for-people-with-disabilities/assessment-of-need-for-people-with-
disabilites/) identifies your childâ€™s health needs and which health services
are needed to meet these needs. The assessment is carried out by the HSE for
children or young people with a disability.

If your child has special educational needs, the NCSE nominates an appropriate
person to help the HSE assess these needs.

Under the [ EPSEN Act 2004
](https://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2004/act/30/section/5/enacted/en/html) ,
a nominated person can be:

  * A psychologist 
  * A medical practitioner 
  * The principal of the school that the child attends, or a teacher nominated by that principal 
  * An appropriately qualified social worker 
  * A therapist qualified to provide support services to children with special educational needs 

The nominated person must complete a [ Report of Education Needs (pdf)
](https://ncse.ie/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/NCSE-Guidance-Note-for-
Schools.pdf) , which is sent back to the HSE. It will be considered as part of
the wider AON. Read more about the assessment of educational needs in [
