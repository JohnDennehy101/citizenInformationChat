##  What are special educational needs?

You are a person with special educational needs if your ability to take part
in, and benefit from, education is restricted, due to an ongoing physical,
sensory, mental health or learning disability.

Not all children with disabilities have special educational needs.

Some schools use the term ‘additional educational needs (AEN)’ instead of
special educational needs.
