###  **Educational Therapy Support Service**

The [ Educational Therapy Support Service (ETSS)
](https://www.gov.ie/en/press-release/7e9c4-ministers-foley-and-naughton-
announce-the-establishment-of-an-educational-therapy-support-service-etss/) is
a new service provided by the NCSE. It is expected to be operational in some
regions from September 2024.

The ETSS will provide occupational therapists, speech and language therapists,
and behaviour practitioners to schools. Therapists will work with teachers in
a classroom to identify any educational needs a student may have, and provide
support.

Schools will apply to the NCSE for access to the ETTS. The application process
is currently being developed.
