###  **National Council for Special Education**

The [ National Council for Special Education (NCSE) ](http://ncse.ie/) works
to improve the delivery of education services to people with special
educational needs. The NCSE is an independent statutory body established by
the Department of Education.

The NCSE gives information to parents and educational institutions on:

  * Best practice for educating children with special educational needs, and 
  * The entitlements of children with special educational needs 

The NCSE also:

  * Plans and co-ordinates the provision of education and support services to children with special educational needs (with schools and the [ Health Service Executive ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/health/health-system/health-service-executive/) ) 
  * Assesses and reviews resources for children with special educational needs 
  * Makes sure that the progress of students with special educational needs is monitored and reviewed 
  * Reviews education provision for adults with disabilities 
  * Consults with voluntary bodies 
  * Advises the Minister for Education on special education matters 
  * Carries out research and publishes findings 
  * Nominates a person to carry out an assessment of education need on behalf of the HSE (see ‘Assessment of Need’ below) 

The Special Education Support Service, the National Behaviour Support Service
and the [ Visiting Teacher Service ](https://ncse.ie/visiting-teacher-support)
moved to the NCSE in 2017. The NCSE support service was set up to provide a
more integrated service to children and their families, as well as to teachers
and schools.
