##  Cohabitation agreements

The [ Civil Partnership and Certain Rights and Obligations of Cohabitants Act
2010 ](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2010/act/24/enacted/en/print) allows
cohabitants to enter into a cohabitants’ agreement to provide for financial
matters during the relationship or when the relationship ends, whether through
death or otherwise. However, the Act sets out that the agreement will only be
valid if each person has had independent legal advice or the couple obtained
legal advice together and have waived (in writing) the right to independent
legal advice. The agreement must be in writing, signed by both parties and
must comply with the general law of contract.

The Court can change or ignore such an agreement if its enforceability would
cause serious injustice.

For further information on cohabitation, see ‘ [ Rights of cohabiting couples
