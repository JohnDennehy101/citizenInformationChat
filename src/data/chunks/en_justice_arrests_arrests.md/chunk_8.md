###  Procedure after arrest

Once you are charged and cautioned, you must be

  * released on bail by the member in charge of the station (a form of bail known as station bail) 
  * transferred from the Garda Station to the District Court as soon as reasonably possible. If you are arrested after 5 pm you may be brought to the District Court as early as possible before noon the following day. At the District Court, you may be released on [ bail ](/en/justice/arrests/bail-and-surety/) or [ remanded in custody ](/en/justice/arrests/detention-after-arrest/) by the judge. 

Only in certain specific circumstances may you be detained in a Garda station
for a length of time before being brought to court. Under the Criminal Justice
Act 1984, you may be detained in a Garda station for up to 24 hours. The
offence of which you are suspected must be one that may be punished by
imprisonment for at least 5 years. The 24-hour period runs from the time of
your arrest but you may agree to a rest period between 12 midnight and 8 am
and this will not be included in the 24 hours.

Under Section 30 of the Offences Against the State Act you may be detained for
up to 48 hours before being brought to Court.

In general, if you are arrested you do not have to say anything. However, if
you are detained under the [ Criminal Justice Act 1984
](http://revisedacts.lawreform.ie/eli/1984/act/22/revised/en/html) you must
tell the Gardaí your name and address. The Gardaí have no general power to
take fingerprints or make forensic tests. They may do these things if you
consent or if they have specific power under specific laws, for example, under
the Offences Against the State Act, [ Criminal Justice Act 1984
](http://revisedacts.lawreform.ie/eli/1984/act/22/revised/en/html) or the [
Criminal Law (Jurisdiction) Act of 1976
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1976/en/act/pub/0014/index.html) .

If you are detained you must be informed of your right to consult a solicitor.
