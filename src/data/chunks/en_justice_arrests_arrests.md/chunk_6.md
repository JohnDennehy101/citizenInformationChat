###  Manner of arrest

Force can only be used to make an arrest if it is reasonably necessary. Once
an arrest is made, a member of An Garda Síochána may use such force as is
necessary to ensure the arrest is maintained.

However, if excessive force or physicality is used, you can take a case to the
Garda Ombudsman. You can also sue the arresting Garda/An Garda Síochána for
assault where the force used was excessive.

When a Garda arrests you, they will actually touch your body or otherwise
restrain your liberty. If you are arrested on a criminal charge, you must be
informed at the time you are arrested of the charge unless this is very clear
(for example, if you are arrested while committing an offence).

If you are brought to the Garda station, you must be cautioned in the
following words:

"You are not obliged to say anything unless you wish to do so, but whatever
you say will be taken down in writing and may be given in evidence."

If it is then decided to charge you, details of the offence must be set out in
a 'charge sheet'. A copy of the details must be given to you. The Garda will
formally charge you by reading each charge over to you and you will be
cautioned after each charge is read out. The Garda must keep a note of any
reply you make.

After you have been charged, the Garda must again caution you using the same
words.
