###  Arrest without a warrant

You may be arrested without a warrant when a Garda, with reasonable cause,
suspects that an arrestable offence has been committed and that you are guilty
of the offence ( [ Section 4 of the Criminal Law Act 1997
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1997/en/act/pub/0014/sec0004.html#sec4) ). An
'arrestable offence' is an offence for which the penalty, for a person who has
no previous convictions, can be 5 years imprisonment or more. Specific laws
give the Garda√≠ specific powers of arrest as well. For example, a Garda can
arrest you under the Road Traffic Acts without a warrant if he/she suspects
that you are committing an offence in relation to drinking and driving
