###  MMR catch-up program

Your child will usually be offered the MMR (measles, mumps and rubella)
vaccine when they are 12 months old, followed by a second dose when they are
aged 4-5 years old in junior infants.

Usually, children can get the MMR until they are aged under 10 years, but
currently you can book an appointment for an MMR vaccine at any age if you or
your child has missed the MMR vaccine. This is known as the [ MMR catch-up
program
](https://www.hse.ie/eng/health/immunisation/news/mmrcatchupprogramme.html) .

Adults born in Ireland before 1978 are likely to have had measles infection
and so would not need to get the MMR vaccination.
