##  Where to get your child vaccinated in Ireland

You are usually offered your child's vaccinations by:

  * The hospital where your baby was born 
  * The HSE 
  * Your GP 
  * The School Immunisation Programme or 
  * The HSE catch-up program 

You can also contact your [ Local Health Office
](http://www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/1/LHO/) or your GP directly.

**Vaccines for babies**

You will usually be offered vaccines for your baby from your GP (family
doctor) until they are 13 months, as part of the [ Primary Childhood
Immunisation Schedule
](https://www.hse.ie/eng/health/immunisation/pubinfo/pcischedule/) . You can
also get your baby vaccinated in hospitals and health clinics.

You should make sure your baby gets their vaccinations on time, or as soon as
possible after they are due. If your baby is due to have a routine
vaccination, you should phone your GP to arrange it.
