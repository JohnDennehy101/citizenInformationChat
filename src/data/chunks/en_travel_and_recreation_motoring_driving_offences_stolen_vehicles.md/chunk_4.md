##  How to prevent your car from being stolen

It's important to be aware of the potential risks when you leave your vehicle
unattended (for even a few moments) in a public place. It's also important to
be mindful of parking, particularly when you park in daylight but return much
later in darkness.

These are some general safety tips and way to prevent your car from being
stolen:

  * Park in a well-lit area if possible 
  * Make sure your car is locked and your car alarm is switched on, or use a steering lock 
  * Do not leave valuables inside the car 
  * Never leave your car running and unattended 
  * Store your keys safely, away from windows and letterboxes in your home
