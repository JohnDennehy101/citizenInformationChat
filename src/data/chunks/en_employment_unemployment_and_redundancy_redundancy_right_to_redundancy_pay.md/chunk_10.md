##  If you are on a fixed-term contract

If you are on a [ fixed-term contract ](/en/employment/employment-rights-and-
conditions/contracts-of-employment/rights-of-fixed-term-workers/) you may be
entitled to statutory redundancy if your employer does not renew your fixed-
term contract under the same or a similar contract before the term expires.

You must still meet the requirement for 2 years' continuous service described
above. A series of shorter contracts that followed on from each other and
added up to 2 years can also meet the 2 yearsâ€™ continuous service requirement.
