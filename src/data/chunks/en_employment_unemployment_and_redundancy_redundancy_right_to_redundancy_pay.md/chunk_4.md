###  You must have been dismissed from your job

To show you were dismissed, your employment must have been terminated (with or
without notice).

There will also be a dismissal if you have ended your contract of employment
because you were forced to leave your job because of your employerâ€™s conduct.
This is known as [ constructive dismissal ](/en/employment/unemployment-and-
redundancy/dismissal/constructive-dismissal/) .
