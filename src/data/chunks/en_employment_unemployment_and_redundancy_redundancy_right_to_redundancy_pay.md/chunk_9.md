##  If you are an apprentice

If you are an apprentice and are made redundant during the apprenticeship, you
may qualify for a redundancy payment. You must meet the conditions of having 2
years' service (104 weeks) over the age of 16.

If you are dismissed within one month of the end of the apprenticeship, you
will not qualify for a redundancy payment.

If you are kept on as an employee for more than a month after the
apprenticeship ended and are subsequently made redundant, the time spent as an
apprentice aged over 16 will count in the redundancy payment calculation.
