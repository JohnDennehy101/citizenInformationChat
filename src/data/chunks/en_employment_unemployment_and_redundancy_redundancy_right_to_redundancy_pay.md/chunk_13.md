##  If you are over 66

In the past, you had to be between 16 and 66 to qualify for statutory
redundancy pay. The upper age limit of 66 was removed by the Protection of
Employment Act 2007.

Employees who are over 16 and in employment which is insurable for all
benefits under the Social Welfare Acts are entitled to statutory redundancy
pay. This includes employees who are over 66 and who would be insurable, **but
for their age** .

The time spent in employment aged over 66 will count in the redundancy payment
calculation.
