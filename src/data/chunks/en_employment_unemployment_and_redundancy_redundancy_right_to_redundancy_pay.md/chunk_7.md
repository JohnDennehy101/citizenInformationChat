##  If you work part-time

By law, [ part-time workers ](/en/employment/types-of-employment/rights-of-
part-time-workers/) cannot have less favourable conditions of employment than
comparable full-time workers.

This means that part-time workers (including casual workers) have a right to
statutory redundancy. You must still meet the requirement for 2 years'
continuous service described above.
