Applications for judicial review in respect of the Environmental Protection
Agency in relation to Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control (IPPC)
licence applications are regulated by statute. Section 87(10) of the [
Environmental Protection Agency Act 1992
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1992/en/act/pub/0007/index.html) (as amended)
provides for judicial review or other legal proceedings to be initiated by any
person, seeking to question the validity of a decision of the Agency to grant
or refuse a licence or a revised licence, within a period of 8 weeks. This
period may be extended, on application, by the High Court, where it considers
that there is good and sufficient reason for doing so. There is no requirement
on the person initiating these proceedings to demonstrate an interest or
indicate a potential personal impact or having a sufficient interest.
