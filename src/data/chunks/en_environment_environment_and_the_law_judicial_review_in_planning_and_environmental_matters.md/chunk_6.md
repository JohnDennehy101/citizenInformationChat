###  Planning and Development Act consents

A specific statutory procedure applies to applications for judicial review of
decisions made by the planning authorities or An Bord Plean√°la. Sections 50
and 50A of the [ Planning and Development Act 2000
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2000/en/act/pub/0030/index.html) (as amended)
set out this procedure, which differs from that provided for in Order 84 of
the Rules of the Superior Courts. In particular the time limit for instituting
a judicial review in respect of a decision under the Planning and Development
Act is 8 weeks from the date of the decision or the doing of an act by a
planning authority or the Board. This time may be extended by the Court if it
is satisfied there is good and sufficient reason for doing so, and the
circumstances that resulted in the failure to make the application for leave
within the 8 weeks were outside the control of, the applicant for such
extension.
