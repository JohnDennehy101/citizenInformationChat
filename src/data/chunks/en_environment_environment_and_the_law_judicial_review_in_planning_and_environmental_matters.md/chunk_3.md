###  Conventional and statutory review

Judicial review is divided into two main categories:

  * **Judicial review in the ordinary or conventional sense:** This is the traditional type of judicial review developed over time by the judges and case law. The procedure governing conventional judicial review can be found in [ Order 84 of the Rules of the Superior Courts ](http://www.courts.ie/rules.nsf/8652fb610b0b37a980256db700399507/a53b0f76ffc6c5b780256d2b0046b3dc?OpenDocument) . Further information on the procedure is available in [ Judicial review of public decisions ](/en/government-in-ireland/how-government-works/standards-and-accountability/judicial-review-public-decisions/) . 
  * **Statutory judicial review:** Specialised statutory schemes of judicial review relating to specific areas of public decision-making which have been singled out by the Oireachtas as warranting specialised schemes because of the policy concerns involved. Statutory schemes and the procedure involved are covered by legislation specific to that area. Statutory schemes apply to such areas as asylum, pollution control, planning and the takeover of companies. 

Statutory judicial review schemes supplement Order 84 of the Rules of the
Superior Courts with their own specific procedural rules. These statutory
schemes narrow the availability of judicial review through such features as:

  * Time limits for an application for leave to bring judicial review proceedings are shorter 
  * Requirements to notify the decision-maker of the leave application 
  * Higher thresholds applied by the High Court when considering whether to allow leave, for example, substantial grounds rather than an arguable case
