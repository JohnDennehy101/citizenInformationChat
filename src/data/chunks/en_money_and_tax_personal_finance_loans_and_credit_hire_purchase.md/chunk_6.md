##  What must be in a hire purchase agreement contract?

A hire purchase agreement is signed by both you (the hirer) and on behalf of
the owner (the finance company). If there is a retailer involved, for example,
a garage, it also signs the agreement and supplies the items.

The hire purchase must include the following details:

**The agreement**

  * The words "Hire Purchase Agreement" which must be stated clearly and in a prominent place on the agreement form. 
  * The names and addresses of all the parties to the agreement. 
  * A statement that you have the right to withdraw from the agreement within 10 days of receiving a copy of the agreement. This is known as a cooling off period. Often you are asked to give away this right by signing a waiver. You do not have to sign this waiver. 

**The goods**

  * Details of the item covered, for example, a car or computer. 
  * The cash price of the item. 
  * A statement that you must tell the owner (finance company) of the location of the item. 

**The costs**

  * The hire purchase price. This is the total amount you will pay over the life of the loan. The hire purchase price is the monthly payment or instalment multiplied by the number of instalments which you have to make. 
  * The amount of each instalment you must pay. Sometimes the final instalment is much larger than all the others (a _balloon payment_ ). 
  * The date you must pay each instalment. 
  * The fees, charges, and penalties that apply. 
  * The Annual Percentage Rate (APR) charged (for agreements made since 16 May 2022). 

Unless all of these requirements are contained in the agreement, the agreement
may not be legally enforceable.

You should try to take some time to read all the terms of the agreement and
make sure you understand them fully before you sign up.
