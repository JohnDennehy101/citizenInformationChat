##  What happens if the item is faulty or damaged?

Your [ consumer rights
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/consumer/consumer-laws/your-consumer-
rights/) are the same whether you buy something outright or through a hire
purchase agreement. Anything you buy on hire purchase must be ‘in conformity’
with the contract, meaning it must meet certain conditions of quality,
performance and durability.

You are entitled to certain remedies, when something you buy under hire
purchase does not meet the conditions or standards. A remedy could be a [
repair, replacement, refund
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/consumer/shopping/problems-with-
faulty-goods/) or a price reduction.

A guarantee under a hire purchase agreement applies in the same way as if
items were bought outright. The manufacturer makes the guarantee.

Under a hire purchase agreement, you must take reasonable care of the hired
item. If you damage the item and return it to the owner or finance company,
they may charge you for the repairs.
