##  The cost of hire purchase

To calculate the real cost of a hire purchase agreement:

  1. Find the total hire purchase price 
  2. Find the price of a cash purchase of the same item 
  3. Deduct the cash price (2) from the total hire purchase price (1) 

**Example** : A garage offers two prices for the same car. The car will cost
you €12,000 if you pay in full with cash. Alternatively, the car will cost you
€17,000 if you want to pay in instalments through a hire purchase agreement.

In this example, the hire purchase cost is €5,000 (€17,000 - €12,000). That
is, it will cost you €5,000 extra to hire the car for a period of time (and
eventually to own it), rather than to buy it outright for cash.

Different lenders have different hire purchase costs. Some will quote an APR
(Annual Percentage Rate). This can help you to compare hire purchase costs. It
may be misleading to compare a hire purchase APR with that of a normal bank or
credit union loan. This is because you are paying for the hire of the goods.
Unlike a loan, you do not own them until the last instalment of the HP
agreement has been paid.

There is a maximum interest rate of 23% APR for hire purchase agreements since
16 May 2022.
