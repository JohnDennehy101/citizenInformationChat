##  What costs are covered by criminal legal aid?

Criminal legal aid covers any fees, costs or expenses for preparing and
conducting your defence. This includes the fees of a [ solicitor
](/en/justice/courtroom/solicitors/) and, in certain circumstances, up to [ 2
counsel or barristers ](/en/justice/courtroom/barristers/) .

Criminal legal aid can also cover the cost of going to trial, appealing a
conviction, or getting a case stated (where the judge refers a question of law
to a higher court).

If your solicitor or barrister thinks the services of non-legal professionals
or experts are necessary to help prepare your defence, legal aid also covers
these fees.

Examples of non-legal professionals or experts include:

  * Doctors 
  * Psychiatrists 
  * Engineers 
  * Forensic scientists 
  * Language experts
