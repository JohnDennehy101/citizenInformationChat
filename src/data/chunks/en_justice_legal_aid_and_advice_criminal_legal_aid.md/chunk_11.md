###  **Can I choose my solicitor?**

If you are granted criminal legal aid, you are assigned a solicitor from the
criminal legal aid panel.

If you tell the court that you wish to be represented by a particular
solicitor, the judge will assign that person to you so long as they are on the
legal aid panel and are available.

If the judge refuses to assign your nominated solicitor, they must give a
reason why and they should ask if you wish to nominate a different solicitor.
