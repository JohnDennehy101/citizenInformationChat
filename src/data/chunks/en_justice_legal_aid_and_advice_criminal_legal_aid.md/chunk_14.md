##  Can I appeal if I am refused legal aid?

You cannot appeal if you are refused criminal legal aid.

However, if the matter is sent forward for hearing to a higher court, you can
make a new application in the higher court. The judge will consider the
application in the same way as your original application (see ‘Do I qualify
for criminal legal aid?’ above).
