###  **Telling the court about your means**

You will need to explain your financial situation to the judge so they can
assess your means.

You may be asked to complete a statement of means that sets out your income,
family circumstances and other relevant details. The District Court clerk at
the District Court offices can give you this form.

If you are a young person, the court will look at the means of your parents or
guardian to see if they can afford to pay for legal advice.

The judge may ask the prosecuting Garda if [ the Garda√≠ ](/en/justice/law-
enforcement/garda-siochana-national-police-force/) object to legal aid being
granted. They rarely object unless they have proof that you are being
untruthful to the court about your means.
