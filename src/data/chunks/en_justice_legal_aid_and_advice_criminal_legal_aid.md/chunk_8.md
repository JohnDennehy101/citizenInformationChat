###  **Fales statements to the court**

When applying for legal aid, it is an offence for you to knowingly:

  * Make a false statement or representation to the judge, either verbally or in writing 
  * Conceal any important fact from the judge 

If you are found guilty of this offence, you could be fined â‚¬2,500 (a [ class
C fine ](/en/justice/criminal-law/criminal-trial/fines-for-criminal-offences/)
) or be sent to prison for up to 6 months (or both).

For example, if you tell a judge that you are unemployed and you are then
given legal aid, but it transpires that you were employed at the time, you are
guilty of an offence.

If you have a query about the granting of criminal legal aid, you should [
contact the Court Clerk or Court Registrar

for the court you are appearing in.
