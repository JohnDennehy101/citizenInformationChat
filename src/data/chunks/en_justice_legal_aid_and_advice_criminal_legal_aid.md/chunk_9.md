##  Do I qualify for criminal legal aid?

There are no eligibility guidelines for criminal legal aid. Instead, the judge
must decide if you qualify.

When deciding if you qualify, the judge considers:

  * Whether you can afford to pay for your own legal advice 
  * How serious the charge is 

If you have been charged with murder, or if your appeal is from the [ Court of
Criminal Appeal to the Supreme Court
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/justice/courts-system/court-of-
appeal/#5d81b4) , the judge only considers whether you can afford to pay for
your own legal advice.

If the charge is not serious, the judge may still grant legal aid in
exceptional circumstances. This includes circumstances where you:

  * Are very ill 
  * Are immature 
  * Lack any formal education 
  * Are emotionally disturbed or lack the mental capacity to understand the process of the court case
