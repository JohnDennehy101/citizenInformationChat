###  **Legal Aid – Custody Issues Scheme**

The Legal Aid – Custody Issues Scheme covers fees for a solicitor and
barrister to represent you in certain criminal matters if you cannot afford to
pay the fees yourself.

The scheme covers:

  * Applications for bail in the [ High Cour ](/en/justice/courts-system/high-court/) t, [ Court of Appeal ](/en/justice/courts-system/court-of-appeal/) or the [ Supreme Court ](/en/justice/courts-system/supreme-court/)
  * Judicial review proceedings about criminal matters or matters where the liberty of the person is at issue 
  * Applications under the [ Extradition Act 1965 ](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1965/en/act/pub/0017/index.html) and the [ European Arrest Warrant Act 2003 ](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2003/act/45/enacted/en/html)
  * Habeas Corpus applications (where a person claims that they are being unlawfully detained by the State) 

To qualify for the scheme, you must demonstrate to the court that you cannot
afford legal representation, and the court must recommend your case to the
Legal Aid Board for the scheme.

The scheme is not an alternative to costs, so you or your legal representative
must apply to the court at the start of the proceedings. You should get legal
advice to see if you are eligible for the scheme.
