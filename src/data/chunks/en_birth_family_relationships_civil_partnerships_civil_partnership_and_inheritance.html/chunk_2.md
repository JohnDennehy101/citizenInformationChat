##  Introduction

Your civil status affects your right to inherit from your spouse or partner.
'Civil statusâ€™ is defined as being one of the following:

  * Single 
  * Married 
  * Separated or divorced 
  * Widowed 
  * In a civil partnership or being a former civil partner in a civil partnership that has ended by death or been dissolved 

Civil partners have the same legal right to inherit as spouses and the same
rights on intestacy. Intestacy is when someone dies without making a valid
will. An existing will is automatically cancelled when you register a civil
partnership unless the registration was considered when making the will.
Bequests (gifts) left to a witness of a will or their spouse or civil partner
are not valid.

**Since the enactment of the Marriage Act 2015, no new civil partnerships can
be registered in Ireland.**

Couples in a civil partnership can apply to marry or remain in a civil
partnership. Partnerships registered abroad since 16 May 2016 are not
recognised as civil partnerships in Ireland.
