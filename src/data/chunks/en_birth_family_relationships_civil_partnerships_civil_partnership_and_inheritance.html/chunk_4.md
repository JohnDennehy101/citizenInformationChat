##  Civil partner's inheritancerights

The amount of the surviving civil partner's legal right share depends on two
factors:

  * If there is a valid will 
  * If the deceased civil partner has any children. 

You are entitled to the whole estate if:

  * There is no will or the will is invalid, and 
  * The deceased civil partner has no children or grandchildren. 

You are entitled to two-thirds of the estate if:

  * There is no valid will, and 
  * The deceased civil partner has children or grandchildren. 

You are entitled to one-half of the estate if:

  * There is a valid will, and 
  * The deceased civil partner has no children or grandchildren. 

You are entitled to one-third of the estate if:

  * There is a valid will, and 
  * The deceased civil partner has children or grandchildren 

If you are the surviving civil partner, you must be informed of this right and
you should apply for your legal right share as soon as possible. You may want
the [ shared home ](/en/birth-family-relationships/separation-and-
divorce/family-and-shared-home/) be given to you instead of your legal right
share, even if the home was left to another person in the will. If the shared
home is worth more than the legal right share, you will normally have to pay
the difference into the deceased's estate. However, in cases of hardship, you
may apply to the court to have the home given to you either without having to
pay the difference, or by paying an amount that the court thinks is
reasonable.
