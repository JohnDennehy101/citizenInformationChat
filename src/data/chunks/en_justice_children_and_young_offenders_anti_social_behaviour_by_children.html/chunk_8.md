###  **What is an anti-social behaviour warning?**

A Garda can issue an anti-social behaviour warning to any child who has
behaved in an anti-social manner.

The Garda may issue the behaviour warning verbally to the child. It must also
be served in writing on the child and their parents or guardian. The written
notice must include the following:

  * A statement that the child has behaved in an anti-social manner 
  * The type of behaviour and when and where it took place 
  * A demand that the child cease the behaviour 
  * A notice that, if the child does not cease the behaviour, an application may be made to the court for an anti-social behaviour order (ASBO) 

The Garda Síochána must give the behaviour warning within 1 month of the
behaviour taking place.

In the case of persistent anti-social behaviour, the warning must be issued
within 1 month of the most recent known instance of that behaviour taking
place.
