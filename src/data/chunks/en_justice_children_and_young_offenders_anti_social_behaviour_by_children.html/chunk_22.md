An anti-social behaviour order or ASBO is an order which stops a child 12
years or older from doing anything specified in the order.

An ASBO is issued by the Children Court when a member of the Garda Síochána
(not below the rank of superintendent) applies to the court.

Before the Court makes such a behaviour order it must be satisfied that:

  * Even though the child has signed the good behaviour contract or participated in the meeting with the Gardaí, the child has continued to behave in an anti-social way and is likely to continue to do so 
  * An order is necessary to prevent the child from continuing to behave in that way 
  * The order is reasonable in the circumstances, taking into account the effect or likely effect of that behaviour on other people 

It is open to the court to impose whatever terms or conditions it considers
appropriate in the order.
