###  Are there any offences relating to behaviour orders?

If a child, without reasonable excuse, does not comply with the behaviour
order, they are guilty of an offence and can be convicted.

If the child is convicted, they can receive a [ class D fine
](mailto:http://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/justice/criminal_law/criminal_trial/maximum_fines_on_summary_conviction.html)
or be [ sentenced to detention ](/en/justice/children-and-young-
offenders/detention-of-children/) in Oberstown Children Detention Campus for
up to 3 months, or both.

If a child is convicted of breaching a behaviour order and is ordered to pay a
fine and the costs of the proceedings, the total of the fine and the costs
must not be more than â‚¬1,500.
