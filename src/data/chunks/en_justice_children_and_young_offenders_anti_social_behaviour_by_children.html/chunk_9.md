###  **How long does a behaviour warning stay in force?**

A behaviour warning will remain in force against a child for 3 months from the
date it is issued. If the child persists in the type of behaviour specified in
the warning during the 3 months, an application may be made to the court for
an ASBO (read more about ASBOs below).
