###  **What conditions can be included in a behaviour order?**

For example, the court might include a condition that the child must not come
within 50 metres of a certain house where they had been causing annoyance or
it may order the child to stay away from a certain shopping centre.

The court may also require the child to comply with certain requirements
relating to attending school or, indeed, reporting to a garda, teacher or
other person in authority.
