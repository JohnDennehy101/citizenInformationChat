###  **What happens at the meeting?**

At the meeting, the superintendent explains to the child and the parents or
guardian in simple language what the offending behaviour is and the effect it
is having on anyone else.

The child is asked to acknowledge that their behaviour took place and to
undertake to stop it. The parents or guardian are also asked to acknowledge
the childâ€™s behaviour and to undertake to take steps to prevent the behaviour
from continuing.

If the child and the parents or guardian agree to give these undertakings, the
superintendent prepares a document known as a _good behaviour contract_ .
