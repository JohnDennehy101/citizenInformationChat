The child may be granted a certificate for free legal aid, which is known as a
[ Legal Aid (Behaviour Order) Certificate ](/en/justice/legal-aid-and-

If a child is brought to the Children Court and is not eligible for free legal
aid, then the child or the childâ€™s parents or guardian must pay for any legal
representation on behalf of the child.
