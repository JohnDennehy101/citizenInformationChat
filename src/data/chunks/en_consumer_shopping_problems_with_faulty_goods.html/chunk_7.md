###  What you must do to end the contract

You must tell the seller you are ending the contract. You can do this verbally
or in writing. You must return the goods to the seller. The seller must cover
the cost of the return. They can ask you to cover the costs of the return
upfront and refund you once they receive your return.

Where the content or service contract is terminated, any ancillary contract is
also automatically terminated. For example, if you return a printer and you
also bought ink from the same seller, you will automatically be entitled to
return the ink and get a refund.
