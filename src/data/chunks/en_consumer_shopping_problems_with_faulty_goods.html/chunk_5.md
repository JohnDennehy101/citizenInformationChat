##  Right to a repair or replacement

If something you bought turns out to be faulty, you can decide to get a repair
or a replacement.

The seller must repair or replace the product for free, within a reasonable
time and without significant inconvenience to you. A reasonable time means the
shortest possible time to fix the issue. For a replacement, you must get the
same or a similar product.

The seller must cover any extra installation costs for the replacement.

If it is not possible or too expensive for the seller to resolve the issue,
you have the right to either a price reduction or refund.
