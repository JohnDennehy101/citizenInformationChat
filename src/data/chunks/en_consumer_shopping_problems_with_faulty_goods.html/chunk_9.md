##  Right to a price reduction

If you prefer, you can ask for a proportionate reduction in price instead of a
refund. A proportionate reduction in price must reflect the reduced value of
the goods to you.

If the fault is minor, you can only ask for a price reduction. If there is a
dispute, it is up to the trader to prove that the fault is minor.
