##  Short term right to cancel

You have a legal right to return something faulty if the issue occurs within
30 days. You can return the product and get a full refund.

You must tell the seller you are ending the contract. You can do this verbally
or in writing. You must return the goods to the seller. The seller must cover
the cost of the return. They can ask you to cover the costs of the return
upfront and refund you once they receive your return.

The seller must give you your refund within 14 days. The refund must be in the
same form as the original payment, unless you agree some other method.

The 30-day period is shorter for goods with a short shelf life.

If the issue occurs after 30 days, you can ask for the goods to be repaired or
replaced, ask for a refund or withhold a proportionate amount of any
outstanding payment that you owe.
