##  Right to a refund

You have the right to end the contract and get a refund where:

  * The seller has not offered a repair or replacement 
  * The fault is serious 
  * The seller cannot fix the issue within a reasonable time 
  * You told the seller you needed the product for a specific date and the seller agreed to this 
  * The same or another issue happens again after the seller repaired or replaced the product 

You also have a legal right to return something faulty if the issue occurs
within 30 days. You can return the product and get a full refund – see ‘short
term right to cancel’ above.
