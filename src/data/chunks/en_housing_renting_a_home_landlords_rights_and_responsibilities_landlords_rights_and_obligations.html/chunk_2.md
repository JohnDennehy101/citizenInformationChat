##  Landlords' rights, responsibilities and the law

If you own land or a building and lease it to a tenant, you are considered a
landlord. Your main rights and responsibilities as a landlord come from
landlord and tenant law, as well as from any lease or tenancy agreement
(written or spoken) between you and your tenant.

Residential tenancies legislation outlines most landlordâ€™s rights and
obligations. You can read a [ consolidated version of the Residential
Tenancies Act 2004
](http://revisedacts.lawreform.ie/eli/2004/act/27/front/revised/en/html) on
the Law Reform Commission's website. This includes all the updates to the Act.

Leases or other tenancy agreements cannot take away from landlords' or
tenants' rights and obligations under the legislation. However, you and your
tenant can agree on matters that are not covered by legislation in a lease or
tenancy agreement, for example, who pays for the utility bills.

If you are renting a **room** in your home, the tenancy does not come under
the residential tenancies legislation (though renting out a **self-contained
flat** in your home is covered). Read more in our page [ Renting out a room in
your home ](/en/housing/owning-a-home/home-owners/renting-a-room-in-your-
home/) .

The [ Residential Tenancies Board (RTB) ](/en/housing/renting-a-
home/resolving-disputes/residential-tenancies-board/) has a [ Good
Landlord/Tenant Guide (pdf)
