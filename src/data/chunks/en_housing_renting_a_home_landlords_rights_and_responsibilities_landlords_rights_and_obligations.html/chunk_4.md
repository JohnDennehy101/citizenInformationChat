###  Student-specific accommodation

Student-specific accommodation is housing that is:

  * Built or designated for students 
  * Used solely to provide residential accommodation to students during the academic term 

Tenants in student-specific accommodation are protected in residential
tenancies legislation. This means that they have most of the same rights as
private tenants. However, there are some differences:

  * Tenants in student-specific accommodation do not have [ security of tenure ](http://staging.citizensinformation.ie/en/housing/renting-a-home/tenants-rights-and-responsibilities/types-of-tenancy/#384575)
  * Landlords may be able to access communal areas without the permission of the tenants 
  * Tenancy or licence arrangements in student-specific accommodation should not be more than 41 weeks, This is so students do not have to pay for accommodation during the summer when you don’t need it. The RTB can sanction you, if you do not comply with the 41-week rule, This rule came in under the [ Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2024 ](http://residential%20tenancies%20\(amendment\)%20act%202024/) and applies to tenancies and licence arrangements in student-specific accommodation created from 20 July 2024. 
  * Tenants in student-specific accommodation only need to give you 28 days’ notice when they end their tenancy. This came in under the [ Residential Tenancies (No.2) Act 2021 ](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2021/act/17/enacted/en/html) . [ You must give them more notice when ending their tenancy ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/housing/renting-a-home/tenants-rights-and-responsibilities/if-your-landlord-wants-you-to-leave/#6a8d36) . 
  * Your tenant can terminate a fixed-term tenancy any time between 1 May and 1 October each year for any reason. But, outside of these dates, the existing rules about ending a fixed-term tenancy apply and they can only end the tenancy for specific reasons. This rule came in under the [ Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2024 ](http://residential%20tenancies%20\(amendment\)%20act%202024/) .
