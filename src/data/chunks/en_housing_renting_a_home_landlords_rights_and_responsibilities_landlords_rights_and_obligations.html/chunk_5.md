##  Your rights as a landlord

You have the right to:

  * Set the rent 
  * Get the correct rent on the date it is due 
  * Get any charges associated with the property (this means taxes and duties or payments) 
  * Terminate a tenancy during the first 6 months without giving a reason 
  * In certain circumstances – [ terminate a tenancy ](/en/housing/renting-a-home/tenants-rights-and-responsibilities/if-your-landlord-wants-you-to-leave/) at a later stage 
  * Be informed about who is ordinarily living in the property (this does not include overnight visitors or short stays) 
  * Be informed about any repairs needed 
  * Be given reasonable access to the property to carry out repairs 
  * Carry out routine inspections at a mutually agreed time 
  * [ Refer disputes ](/en/housing/renting-a-home/resolving-disputes/disputes-between-landlords-and-tenants/) to the RTB – but only if you have registered the tenancy 
  * Review the rent. There are rules about how often you can [ review the rent ](/en/housing/renting-a-home/landlords-rights-and-responsibilities/rent-increases-in-private-rented-housing/) in a private tenancy. These timeframes depend on when the tenancy started and if the property is in a Rent Pressure Zone or not. AHB rents are reviewed every 12 months, or according to the tenancy agreement. 
  * For private tenancies only – decide whether the tenant can sub-let or assign a tenancy. However, if you refuse to allow a tenant to assign or sublet a tenancy, this can give the tenant the right to terminate a fixed-term tenancy before it expires 

You do **not** have the right to:

  * Enter your tenant's home without permission 
  * Take or keep your tenant’s property – even if they haven’t paid the rent 
  * Charge more than the market rate for the property 
  * Penalise your tenant for bringing a dispute to the RTB
