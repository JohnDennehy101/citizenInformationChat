##  What can I not appeal?

Some social welfare payments are not covered by the appeals process. This is
because they are not set out on a statutory basis, for example, [ Fuel
Allowance ](/ga/social-welfare/extra-social-welfare-benefits/fuel-allowance/)
or the [ Back to School Clothing and Footwear Allowance ](/ga/social-
welfare/families-and-children/liuntas-eadai-agus-coisbhirt-don-scoilbhliain-
nua/) .

There is no formal appeals process for these payments, but if you are unhappy
with a decision on a payment [ not covered by the Social Welfare Appeals
Process ](https://www.gov.ie/en/service/ce66b1-how-to-appeal-a-decision-about-
your-social-welfare-claim/#list-of-schemes-you-cannot-appeal) , you can ask
for the decision to be reviewed by the section in the Department of Social
Protection that dealt with your application.
