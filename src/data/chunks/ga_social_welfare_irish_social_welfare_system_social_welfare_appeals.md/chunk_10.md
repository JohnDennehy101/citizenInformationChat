####  **What to include**

In your appeal you must:

  * Say why you think the decision was not correct 
  * Include copies of any evidence and documents you want to be considered (you should keep your original documents) 
  * Enclose a copy of the letter you got from the Deciding Officer or Designated Person that informed you of the decision 

The Deciding Officer must always give you the reasons for the decision in
writing and the letter should be easy to understand.

You can request an oral hearing at this stage (see ‘What is an oral hearing?’
below).
