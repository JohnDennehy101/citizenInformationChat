####  **When the SWAO receives your appeal**

The Social Welfare Appeals Office (SWAO) will:

  * Let you know that they got your appeal. You will be notified on your MyWelfare account if you submitted your appeal online, otherwise you will be notified by post. 
  * Let the Department of Social Protection know of the appeal. The Department must then send any relevant documents to the SWAO. 

When the Department receives notice of an appeal, it reviews the original
decision to decide whether it should be revised in your favour.
