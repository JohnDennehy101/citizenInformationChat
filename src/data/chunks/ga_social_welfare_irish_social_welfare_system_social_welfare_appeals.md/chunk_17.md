##  What is an oral hearing?

Your appeal may be heard at an oral hearing. This can be arranged either
because you have requested one or because the Appeals Officer decided that
this is appropriate for your appeal. Hearings are held in private.

You will be invited to attend this hearing. It is informal and you can bring a
representative to the hearing with you for support or assistance.

A representative may include:

  * A friend 
  * A colleague 
  * A public representative 
  * A trade union official 

You can also bring legal representation.

If you live in Dublin or the surrounding areas, hearings are held at the
Social Welfare Appeals Office (see address in ‘Contact details’ below).

If you live outside Dublin, hearings are held at a venue as near as possible
to where you live.
