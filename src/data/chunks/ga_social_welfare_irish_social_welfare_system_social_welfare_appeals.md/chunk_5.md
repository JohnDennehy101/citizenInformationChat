##  Who investigates my appeal?

The [ Social Welfare Appeals Office (SWAO)
](http://www.socialwelfareappeals.ie/) operates independently of the
Department of Social Protection. It provides an independent, accessible and
fair appeals service in relation to entitlement to social welfare payments.

The Office is headed by a Chief Appeals Officer and has its own Appeals
Officers who make decisions on appeals.
