##  Appealing a decision

If you think you have been wrongly refused a social welfare payment, you can
appeal this decision to the Social Welfare Appeals Office.

You must appeal within 21 days of the date of the decision letter. There is no
fee for making an appeal.

Some social welfare payments are not covered by the appeals process (see ‘What
can I not appeal?’ below).
