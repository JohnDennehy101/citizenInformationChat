###  Reviews

Your entitlement to a GP visit card is reviewed periodically by the HSE. This
is because your circumstances may change. If you don’t return your review
form, your GP visit card may not be re-issued.

If you return your review form by the given date but the review process
continues past the expiry date of your card, the HSE may extend your card’s
validity so that you can continue to use it while the review is taking place.
The extension is on a month-by-month basis, so it is advisable to contact the
HSE Client Registration Unit (contact details below) to confirm that your card
has been extended and continues to be valid.
