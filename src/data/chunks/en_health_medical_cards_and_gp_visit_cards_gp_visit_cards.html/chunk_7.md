###  **Allowable expenses**

Some living expenses are allowable. This means they increase your weekly basic
rate of income.

Allowable expenses include:

  * Childcare costs 
  * Rent (not including any amounts paid by [ Housing Assistance Payment ](/en/housing/renting-a-home/help-with-renting/housing-assistance-payment/) or [ Rent Supplement ](/en/social-welfare/supplementary-welfare-schemes/rent-supplement/) ) 
  * Reasonable mortgage payments on your family home and other land or property. 
  * Mortgage protection insurance and associated life assurance. 
  * Home insurance. 
  * Maintenance payments you make. 
  * Nursing home, private nursing or home care costs for you or your spouse. 
  * Costs of travelling to work including: 
    * The cost of public transport. 
    * Driving expenses if a car is required, at a rate of 30 cent per mile/18 cent per km. If a couple needs two cars to travel to work, a double allowance applies. The cost of parking can be taken into account. 
    * Reasonable contributions towards carpooling costs.
