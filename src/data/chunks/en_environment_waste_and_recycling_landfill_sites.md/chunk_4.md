##  What are the fees for using a landfill site?

When you send waste to a landfill, there are charges of:

  * A government levy of €85 per tonne 
  * A gate fee is charged by the owner – check prices with the local authority or private company that runs the site 

[ From 1 September 2023 ](https://www.gov.ie/en/press-
release/75262-introduction-of-new-environment-levies-will-incentivise-
recycling-and-help-ireland-meet-our-eu-waste-targets/) , the waste recovery
levy is €10 per tonne (or 1,000kg) when using a landfill site. The existing
government levy has also increased by €10, to €85 per tonne. Check with your
waste company to see if there is an increase in the cost of collecting your
bins.
