##  What can I dispose of at a landfill site?

Landfill sites usually accept most household rubbish but you should contact
your local landfill site to ask if it will accept your items. [ Your local
authority ](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/942f74-local-authorities/) will
have details of landfill sites in your area.
