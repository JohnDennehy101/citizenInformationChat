###  **Tax reliefs and allowances for farmers**

There are many tax reliefs and allowances for farmers which may help to reduce
the amount of tax you pay.

**Income from long-term leasing**

If you lease land on a long-term lease, the income you get from this may be
exempt from tax up to a certain threshold. To qualify, the lease must be in
writing and for 5 years or more. Leases between close relatives do not qualify
for the relief. For more information, see [ leasing farm land on revenue.ie
](https://www.revenue.ie/en/personal-tax-credits-reliefs-and-exemptions/land-
and-property/leasing-farm-land/index.aspx) .

**The Succession Farm Partnership Scheme**

The [ Succession Farm Partnership Scheme
](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/2d52c-guidance-for-farmers-on-succession-
farm-partnerships/) is a tax incentive for entering an approved partnership
with your successor which involves transferring of at least 80% of the farm
assets to them.

**Capital Acquisitions Tax Agricultural relief**

Agricultural property that is given as a gift or inherited can have its market
value reduced by 90% for tax calculation purposes. The person getting the
property must either be an active farmer or someone who is leasing out the
property on a long-term basis for agricultural use to active farmers.
