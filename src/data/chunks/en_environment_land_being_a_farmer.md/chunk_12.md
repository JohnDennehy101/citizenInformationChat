###  **PRSI for farmers**

If you are a self-employed farmer, you pay [ **Class S PRSI**
](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social_welfare/irish_social_welfare_system/social_insurance_prsi/class_S_prsi.html&sa=U&ved=0ahUKEwiWmtKYqpncAhWIyKQKHZyZB-

When you pay PRSI, you build up entitlements to social insurance benefits.

[ **Class S contributions**
](http://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social_welfare/irish_social_welfare_system/social_insurance_prsi/class_S_prsi.html)
cover you for a limited number of payments. In general, they do not cover you
for any short-term payments including illness and disability payments.

If you satisfy all the other conditions, Class S contributions mean you can
get:

  * [ Maternity Benefit ](http://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/social_welfare_payments_to_families_and_children/maternity_benefit.html)
  * [ Adoptive Benefit ](http://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/social_welfare_payments_to_families_and_children/adoptive_benefit.html)
  * [ Paternity Benefit ](http://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/social_welfare_payments_to_families_and_children/paternity_benefit.html)
  * [ Widow’s, Widower’s or Surviving Civil Partner’s (Contributory) Pension ](http://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/death_related_benefits/widows_contrib_pension.html)
  * [ State Pension (Contributory) ](http://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/older_and_retired_people/state_pension_contributory.html)
  * [ Treatment Benefit Scheme ](http://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/disability_and_illness/treatment_benefit_scheme.html)
  * [ Invalidity Pension ](http://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/disability_and_illness/invalidity_pension.html)

When you are self-employed, you register for self-assessment with Revenue and
you are automatically registered for PRSI. When you submit your annual tax
return, Revenue will let you know if you have to pay PRSI.

If you do not have to pay PRSI, you may be able to pay voluntary contributions
to maintain your social insurance record.
