##  Introduction

There are different roles involved in owning or working on a farm.

If you’re just getting into farming, there are grants and courses to get you
started.

If you’re already working in farming, there are a variety of supports
available, including farming grants and payments and social welfare supports.

You have a number of responsibilities if you own and run a farm, like paying
taxes. You also have specific responsibilities if you employ people on your
farm.

If you want to retire from farming, you should consider all your options, such
as planning for farm inheritance so you can pass your farm on to your
successor.

This page has information about the supports you can get at the different
stages of your farming life, as well as your responsibilities, especially if
you are employing people on your farm.
