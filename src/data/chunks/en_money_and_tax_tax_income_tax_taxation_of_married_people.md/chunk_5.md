##  Assessment as a single person

Under assessment as a single person, also known as separate treatment, each
spouse or civil partner is treated as a single person for tax reasons. With
this option:

  * Both spouses or civil partners are taxed on their own income 
  * Both spouses or civil partners get tax credits and the same standard rate cut-off point due to a single person 
  * Both spouses or civil partners pay their own tax 
  * Both spouses or civil partners complete their own return of income form and claim their own tax credits. One spouse or civil partner cannot claim relief for payments made by the other. There is no right to transfer tax credits or standard rate cut-off point to each other. 

You can request separate treatment in [ myAccount
](https://www.ros.ie/myaccount-web/home.html) or by writing to Revenue. Either
spouse or civil partner can make the claim and the option remains until the
person who claims it changes their mind. If you want to claim assessment as a
single person, you must apply within the tax year (preferably at the start of
the year).

Choosing to be assessed as a single person when you are married or in a civil
partnership is unfavourable in some circumstances. This is mainly because you
cannot transfer any unused tax credits or standard rate cut-off point. You
cannot claim [ Home Carer's Tax Credit ](/en/money-and-tax/tax/income-tax-
credits-and-reliefs/home-carers-tax-credit/) if your spouse or civil partner
is caring for a dependent person and would otherwise qualify for the relief.
