###  If you are already getting a social welfare payment

Half-rate Parent's Benefit may be payable if you are getting any one of the
following payments:

  * [ One-Parent Family Payment ](/en/social-welfare/families-and-children/one-parent-family-payment/)
  * [ Widower's and Surviving Civil Partner's (Contributory) Pension ](/en/social-welfare/death-related-benefits/widowed-persons-contrib-pension/)
  * [ Widower's and Surviving Civil Partner's (Non-Contributory) Pension ](/en/social-welfare/death-related-benefits/widowed-persons-non-contrib-pension/)
  * Death Benefit by way of Widow's/Widower's/Surviving Civil Partner's or Dependent Parents' Pension (under the Occupational Injuries Scheme) 

If you are providing full-time care to another person, you may qualify for [
half-rate Carer's Allowance ](/en/social-welfare/carers/half-rate-carers-
allowance/) with your Parent's Benefit.

If you are getting a [ Working Family Payment (WFP) ](/en/social-
welfare/families-and-children/working-family-payment/) , you can continue to
get your WFP with your Parent's Benefit as long as you meet the qualifying
criteria for both.
