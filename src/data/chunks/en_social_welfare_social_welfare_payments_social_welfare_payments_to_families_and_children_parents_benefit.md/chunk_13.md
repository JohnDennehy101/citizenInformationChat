###  Online applications

You apply for Parent's Benefit online at [ MyWelfare.ie
](https://www.mywelfare.ie/Account/Login) . You have to fill in the questions
asked in the online form. You also need:

  * Your baby’s PPS number 
  * Your employer’s ERN (Employer’s Registration Number) and the name and address of your employer 

You must declare that your parent’s leave dates have been approved by your
employer (you don’t need documentation to prove this). If you are applying for
increases for dependants (spouse or partner and/or children) you need their
PPS numbers and information about their income.

You must have a [ Public Services Card ](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-
welfare-system/public-services-card/) (linked to your mobile phone number) and
a verified [ MyGovID ](https://www.mygovid.ie/en-IE/GettingStarted) account to
apply online.

To find out if your mobile phone number is linked to your Public Services
Card, contact your local [ Intreo Centre or Social Welfare Branch Office
](http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/SAFE-Registration-PSC-Location.aspx) . If you
do not already have a Public Services Card, you can make an appointment to get
one at mywelfare.ie. You will first need to register with the site. To do this
you need a mobile phone number and an e-mail address. When you have made your
appointment, print the notification and bring it to your appointment along
with the required documents (listed in the notification).
