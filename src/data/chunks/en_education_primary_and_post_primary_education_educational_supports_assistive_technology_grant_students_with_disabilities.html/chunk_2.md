##  What is assistive technology?

Assistive technology helps students with a disability who have difficulty
communicating through speech and writing to fully participate in education.

Some examples of assistive technology include laptops or tablets with modified
software, joysticks, keyboards, touch pads, tapes, braille equipment and
audiology equipment.

Schools can get an Assistive Technology Grant from the Department of Education
to buy computers and specialist equipment for students with a disability.
