##  How to appeal if you are refused the Assistive Technology Grant

A school can appeal the decision where:

  * Assistive technology has not been granted, or 
  * Assistive technology has been granted but the school wants to appeal the amount of the grant, or the specific equipment provided. 

A school must complete and submit the [ appeal form
](https://www.gov.ie/pdf/38628/?page=1) .

When submitting the [ appeal form ](https://www.gov.ie/pdf/38628/?page=1) the
school should not re-submit the original application or professional reports
supplied to the SENO.

If there are new or updated reports – different to the original application –
then these can be submitted to the SENO in support of a new application.
