###  Holidays and social welfare payments

In general you can take up to 2 weeks holidays each year and have your social
welfare payment paid. However, you must always notify your local Intreo Centre
or Social Welfare Branch Office before you leave and to check your
entitlements. If you plan to take longer holidays or to be abroad for a longer
period your social welfare payment may not be paid.
