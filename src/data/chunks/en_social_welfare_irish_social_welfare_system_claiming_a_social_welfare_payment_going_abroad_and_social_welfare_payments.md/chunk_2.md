##  Introduction

You can get certain Irish social welfare payments and live in another country.
You can also continue to get certain social welfare payments if you are on
holiday abroad for a specific period of time or if you are getting medical
treatment abroad.

Most [ social insurance payments ](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-
system/social-insurance-prsi/social-insurance/) can be paid to you outside of
this state, though the duration can depend on the payment and your
circumstances. However, to get a [ social assistance payment ](/en/social-
welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/social-assistance-payments/social-
assistance-in-ireland/) you must live in the State.
