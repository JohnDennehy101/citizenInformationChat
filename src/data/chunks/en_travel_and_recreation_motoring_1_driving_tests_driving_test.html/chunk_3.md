###  NCT Update

You must have a valid NCT disc to sit your driving test, because one of the
requirements of a driving test is to have a roadworthy vehicle. If you have an
upcoming driving test appointment but you do not have a valid NCT, you need to
cancel your driving test through the [ MyRoadSafety portal
](https://www.rsa.ie/myroadsafety-login) . You can reschedule your test twice
without losing your fee, once you give at least 10 daysâ€™ notice.

If you're not able to get an appointment at your chosen NCT centre, you can
add your vehicle to a priority list through the [ NCT website
](https://www.ncts.ie/1230/) or phone 01 4135992. The NCT will do their best
to accommodate you with a time and date that's convenient. Your car can be
tested up to 90 days in advance of its test due date without affecting the
expiry date of the cert.
