##  I am not getting my public holiday entitlements

If you are not getting your public holiday entitlement, you should discuss
this with your employer.

You can also complain to the WRC under the Organisation of Working Time Act.
You must make your complaint using the WRCâ€™s [ online complaint form
](https://www.workplacerelations.ie/en/Complaints_Disputes/Refer_a_Dispute_Make_a_Complaint/)
**within 6 months** of the dispute or complaint occurring.

This time limit may be extended for a further 6 months if there was reasonable
cause for the delay.

redress/adjudication-employment-rights-disputes-and-complaints/) , including
details of the WRC adjudication process.
