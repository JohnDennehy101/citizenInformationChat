###  If you lose your job

If your employment finishes during the week, ending on the day before a public
holiday, and you have worked for your employer for the previous 4 weeks, you
should get an additional day's pay for the public holiday. This also applies
to part-time employees who have worked at least 40 hours in the previous 5
weeks.

**For example:**

In the case of [ Gazboro Ltd. -v- BATU (DWT9916)
](http://www.workplacerelations.ie/en/Cases/1999/July/DWT9916.html) , the
claimants finished their employment on 18 December 1998. They claimed an
entitlement to be paid for the public holidayâ€™s on 25 and 26 December.

As the Court interpreted the wording of [ Section 23(2)(a)
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1997/en/act/pub/0020/sec0023.html#sec23) of
the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997, the week ending at midnight on 24
December began at midnight on 18 December. Since the claimants worked for the
employer during the 4 weeks before that week, they were entitled to an
additional day's pay for 25 December.

The week ending on 25 December began at midnight on 19 December. Since the
claimants ceased to be employed on 18 December, they had no entitlement to be
paid for 26 December.
