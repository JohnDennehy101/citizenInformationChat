###  Older people

If you are aged 65 or over, you are liable to pay income tax in the normal
way. However, there are tax exemption limits for people aged 65 or over and
there are some extra tax credits. It is possible to get tax relief for
covenants to people aged 65 and over. You may be exempt from [ DIRT (Deposit
Interest Retention Tax) ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/money-and-
