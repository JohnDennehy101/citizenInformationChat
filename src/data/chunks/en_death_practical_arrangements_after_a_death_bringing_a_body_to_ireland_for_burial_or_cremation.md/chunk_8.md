##  Bringing ashes home

Instead of bringing the deceasedâ€™s body home for burial or cremation you may
cremate it abroad and transport the ashes home. The transport of human ashes
will normally require a death certificate and a cremation certificate to be
presented at the place of departure. There may be additional requirements
depending on the country you are departing from. You should [ contact the
relevant Irish embassy or consulate
](https://www.ireland.ie/en/dfa/embassies/) to check for any local
requirements.

You should also contact you transport carrier to find out if the ashes should
be carried as hand luggage or as checked-in luggage. You may be asked to carry
the ashes in a non-metallic container so they can be x-rayed by security.
