##  Formal identification of the remains

Before any arrangements can be made to return a body to Ireland, the remains
must be formally identified. The rules on who may formally identify a deceased
person can vary by country, but usually identification may be carried out by a
travelling companion or business colleague of the deceased. In some countries
it may be necessary for a family member to travel there to confirm the
identity.

Further information on the local arrangements for formal identification of
Irish citizens abroad is available from the [ Irish embassy
](https://www.ireland.ie/en/dfa/embassies/) for the country where the death
occurred.
