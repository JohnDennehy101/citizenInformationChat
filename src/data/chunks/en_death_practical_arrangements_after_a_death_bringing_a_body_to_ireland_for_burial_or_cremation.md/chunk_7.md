##  Registering the death

If the death is registered in the country where the person died, it is not
normally registered in Ireland. Where a system of registration does not exist
in that country or where it is not possible to obtain copies of the relevant
civil registration record (death certificate), you should contact the [
General Register Office in Ireland ](/en/birth-family-relationships/getting-
birth-marriage-or-death-certificate/) to see if the death can be registered in
Ireland.

A death certificate is an important legal document, evidence of which is
frequently required in Ireland in order to deal with the deceased's estate.

deceaseds-estate/dealing-with-the-deceaseds-estate/) .

If an Irish citizen who has been ordinarily resident in Ireland within the
past 5 years dies abroad their death can be recorded on the [ Record of Deaths
Abroad ](https://www.gov.ie/en/service/b9b43-record-a-death-abroad/) . Doing
this is voluntary but it allows the relatives of the deceased to notify the
Civil Registration Service of the death, to have the death recorded and to
obtain a certified copy of the record.
