##  Introduction

Every country has its own rules about the formalities to be followed when
someone dies. The purpose of the following information is to set out the
general process and rules involved when bringing a body to Ireland for burial
or cremation.

The information is primarily for families of Irish citizens. Families of non-
Irish nationals should contact the relevant embassy for their own country for
advice, if they wish to bring a body to Ireland. You can find [ a list of
foreign embassies and consulates ](https://www.ireland.ie/en/dfa/embassies/)
responsible for Ireland. You can [ read about sending a body out of Ireland
](/en/death/practical-arrangements-after-a-death/sending-a-body-from-ireland-
for-burial-or-cremation-abroad/) .

Repatriation of the remains of a deceased person to Ireland can be an
expensive process. If the person had travel insurance or private medical cover
that may help cover the costs. You may wish to consider having the body
cremated abroad and the ashes returned to Ireland. Financial assistance with
the cost of repatriation of a dead body is not available from the Irish
embassy.
