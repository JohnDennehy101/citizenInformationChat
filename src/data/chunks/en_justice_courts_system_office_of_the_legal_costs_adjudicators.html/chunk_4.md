###  1\. Party and party costs

These are essentially all the costs, charges and expenses that are necessary
and appropriate for the purpose of the case. It's important to remember that
all the costs may not be allowable and if you are claiming party and party
costs - you must be able to justify why each cost was incurred and why those
costs should be allowed.

In the past, the courts have held that when you are conducting your case you
must remember that your adversary may have to pay your costs (or you may have
to pay theirs). It is important, therefore, that you are careful about any
costs you incur.
