###  **Apply directly**

If your solicitor does not apply for adjudication, you can do so yourself. You
must:

  * Complete and lodge the Notice of Application for Adjudication of Costs form (in duplicate form) 
  * Lodge the Bill of Costs and all supporting documentation with the Office of the Legal Costs Adjudicators. 

The Office of the Legal Costs Adjudicators will then inform you when you
should attend the hearing.

You must then serve on the other side:

  * All the documents above 
  * A copy of the issued Notice of Application for Adjudication of Costs. 
  * Tell them the date when the matter will next come before the Legal Costs Adjudicator.
