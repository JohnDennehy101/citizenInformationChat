##  Rules

To register the stillbirth, you will need a signed medical certificate
including:

  * The baby's weight and gestational age 
  * The name and address of where the stillbirth took place 

You can get the signed medical certificate from the doctor, midwife or medical
practitioner who attended the birth or examined the baby.

If a stillbirth is not registered within 12 months, the hospital, midwife or
medical practitioner who attended the birth may be asked to register it.
