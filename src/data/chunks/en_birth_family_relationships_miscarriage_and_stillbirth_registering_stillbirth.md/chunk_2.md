##  Introduction

A stillbirth is the death or loss of a baby before or during delivery. The
baby must have had a gestational age of at least 24 weeks or weighed at least
500 grams (1lb 1.6oz).

Experiencing the loss of your baby is extremely difficult and a very emotional
time for you, your family and friends. The [ HSE provides information on
stillbirth ](https://www2.hse.ie/conditions/child-health/stillbirth/when-
stillbirth-happens.html) , including possible causes and what happens after
the diagnosis of a stillbirth. The Pregnancy and Infant Loss Ireland website
has [ information, advice and details of supports available for parents that
experience a stillbirth ](https://pregnancyandinfantloss.ie/) .

Stillbirth is different to miscarriage. A miscarriage can occur at any stage
of a pregnancy, up until 24 weeks. When a baby lives for only a few hours or
days after birth their death is referred to as a neonatal death.

In Ireland, all stillbirths can be registered but it is not mandatory. A
stillbirth is registered by signing the Stillbirths Register. A stillbirth may
be registered in any HSE [ Civil Registration Service
](https://www2.hse.ie/services/births-deaths-and-marriages/contact-a-civil-
registration-service.html) .

This document outlines the process for registering a stillbirth in Ireland.
