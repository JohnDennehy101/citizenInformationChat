###  If the stillbirth happened before 1995

If you wish to register a stillbirth that happened before 1 January 1995, you
will need specific evidence that the stillbirth occurred. This evidence could
be a written statement from your hospital, nursing home, medical practitioner
or midwife, but the registrar may accept other forms of evidence.

Again, the stillbirth can only be registered if the baby weighed at least 500
grams (1lb 1.6oz) or had a gestational age of at least 24 weeks.
