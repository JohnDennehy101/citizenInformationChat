###  Casual workers

There is no exact definition for _casual workers_ in employment law. Casual
workers are usually on standby for work without set hours. Casual workers are
considered employees and are entitled to certain rights and protections.

Some legislation will apply, for example, the right to a payslip. For another
right, a set period of employment is needed. It will be unlikely that a casual
worker will have enough service to qualify. For example, you need 2 years of
service to be eligible for [ statutory redundancy
