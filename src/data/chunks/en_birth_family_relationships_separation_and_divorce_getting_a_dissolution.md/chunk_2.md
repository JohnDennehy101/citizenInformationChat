##  What is a decree of dissolution?

A decree of dissolution formally ends a civil partnership. If a court is
satisfied that the required conditions (see 'Rules' below) are met, the court
will grant the decree of dissolution, dissolving the civil partnership. When
it grants the decree of dissolution, the court may also make orders in
relation to the payment of [ maintenance ](/en/birth-family-
relationships/separation-and-divorce/maintenance-orders-and-agreements/) and
lump sums, the transfer of property, the extinguishment of succession rights,
[ pension ](/en/birth-family-relationships/separation-and-divorce/sep-divorce-
pensions/) rights etc.

Both of you must be living separate lives (see 'Living apart' below) for 2
years before an application for a dissolution can be made. You may decide to
enter into a [ separation agreement ](/en/birth-family-
relationships/separation-and-divorce/separation-agreement/) to regulate
matters between you before you seek a dissolution.

In any application for a decree of dissolution, the court can review any
previous arrangements made by you both such as a separation agreement,
particularly if the circumstances of either of you have changed.

When a decree of dissolution is granted, it cannot be reversed.

Either of you can apply to court to have any orders made under the decree -
such as a maintenance order - reviewed by the court.
