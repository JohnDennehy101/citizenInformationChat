##  How to apply for a dissolution

You are not legally required to use a [ solicitor
](/en/justice/courtroom/solicitors/) or a [ barrister
](/en/justice/courtroom/barristers/) . If you wish, you can choose to
represent yourself. However, there may be complex issues which may make it
very difficult to apply for a dissolution without some professional help.

When applying for a dissolution in the [ Circuit Court ](/en/justice/courts-
system/circuit-court/) , you will be required to submit 3 documents initially:

  * An application form (known as a civil partnership civil bill). This document describes both you and your civil partner, your occupations and where you live. It also sets out when you registered your civil partnership, for how long you have been living apart and the names and birth dates of your children. 
  * A sworn statement of means (Form 51). This document sets out your assets, your income, your debts, your liabilities and your outgoings. 
  * A sworn statement relating to the welfare of any dependent children (Form 37B). This document sets out the personal details of the children. It describes where they live and with whom. It also describes their education and training, their health, childcare arrangements and maintenance and access arrangements. 

There is no requirement to submit a document certifying that you have been
advised of the alternatives to dissolution, unlike in divorce applications.

When all of the necessary documents have been filed, you will be given a date
for the court hearing. The hearing will be held in private and you will need
to show the court that you meet the requirements of the [ Civil Partnership
and Certain Rights and Obligations of Cohabitants Act 2010
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2010/en/act/pub/0024/index.html) . If the
court is satisfied that you have grounds for a dissolution, it will grant a
decree of dissolution.
