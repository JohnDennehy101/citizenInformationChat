##  Selling sexual services

It is not an offence to receive money (or any other form of payment) in
exchange for sexual services. However, it is against the law to advertise this
service.

Sex workers are also not allowed to work together in the same premises. For
example, two sex workers who share an apartment and provide sexual services
there are operating a brothel under the law.
