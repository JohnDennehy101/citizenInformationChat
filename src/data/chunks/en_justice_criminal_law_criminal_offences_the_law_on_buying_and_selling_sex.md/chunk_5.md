##  Profiting from people who sell sexual services

It is against the law to profit from another person who provides sexual
services, or to control or direct their activities for profit. This is
commonly referred to as ‘pimping’, but may also include keeping a brothel.

It is a criminal offence to coerce a person to provide sexual services for
your own financial benefit.

If found guilty of an offence under these laws, you could be fined up to €5000
and/or sentenced to up to 12 months in prison. For more serious charges, you
could be sentenced to up to 10 years imprisonment and an unlimited fine.
