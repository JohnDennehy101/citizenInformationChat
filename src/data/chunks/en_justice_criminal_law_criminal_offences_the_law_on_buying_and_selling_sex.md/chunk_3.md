##  Buying sexual services

It is an offence to pay, promise to pay, or give any other remuneration or
compensation, to another person in exchange for “sexual activity”. If
convicted, you could be fined €500 for a first offence, or €1000 for a second
or subsequent offence. In addition, if the person is trafficked, higher
penalties apply. If convicted by the Circuit Court, the maximum penalties are
5 years in prison, an unlimited fine or both. It is a defence to any charge to
prove that you did not know and had no reasonable grounds for believing that
the person was trafficked.

Sexual activity means any activity that a reasonable person would consider
sexual. The law applies equally to men and women.

It is also an offence to request sexual services from another person in a
public place in exchange for money. If found guilty, an offender could be
fined up to €500 for a first offence, and up to €1,000 for a second or
subsequent offence. In addition, you could be sent to prison for up to 4 weeks
for a third or subsequent offence.

Offering to pay for sexual services from a person under 17 is a far more
serious offence and a court can sentence an offender to up to 5 years
imprisonment for making the request.
