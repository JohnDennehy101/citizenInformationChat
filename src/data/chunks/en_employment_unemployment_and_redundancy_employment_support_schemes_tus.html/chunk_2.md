##  What is Tús?

The Tús initiative is a community work placement scheme providing short-term
working opportunities for unemployed people. The work opportunities are to
benefit the community and are provided by community and voluntary
organisations in both urban and rural areas. The Tús initiative is managed by
local development companies and Údarás na Gaeltachta for the Department of
Social Protection (DSP), which has overall responsibility for the scheme.

Unemployed people who are eligible to participate in the scheme are selected
and contacted by the DSP – see 'Selection process' below.
