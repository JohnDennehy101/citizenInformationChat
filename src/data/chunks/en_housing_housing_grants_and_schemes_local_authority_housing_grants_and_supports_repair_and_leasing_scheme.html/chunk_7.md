##  What arrangement will I have with my local authority?

Under the Repair and Leasing Scheme you can agree to make your property
available to the local authority or AHB for social housing through:

  * A direct lease arrangement, or 
  * A rental availability agreement (RAA) 

The main difference between the two options is that under a lease agreement
the local authority or AHB is the landlord and looks after the tenant and the
maintenance of the property. With an RAA the owner is the landlord and has
these responsibilities.

The two options also have different maximum terms and rents available. Below
see a table outlining the main differences between the options:

|  **Direct lease agreement** |  **Rental availability agreement (RAA)**  
---|---|---  
**Term** |  5 – 25 years  |  5 – 10 years   
**Rent** |  80% of current open market rate less RLS offset for the repairs  (85% for apartments with a significant service charge and 70% for properties under the pilot scheme)  |  92% of current market rate less RLS offset for the repairs  (95% for apartments with a significant service charge)   
**Cost savings** |  • No rent loss due to vacant periods  • No rent arrears  • No letting fees  • No advertising costs  • No RTB tenancy registration charge  • No day to day maintenance costs  |  • No rent loss due to vacant periods  • No rent arrears  • No letting fees  • No advertising costs   
**Tenant management** |  Local authority or AHB is responsible and they are the landlord  |  Property owner is responsible and is the landlord   
**Property maintenance** |  Local authority or AHB is responsible  |  Property owner is responsible   
  
To agree to either of these arrangements, you will have to prove that you own
the property and that you are tax compliant. You should consult with your
finance or mortgage provider and get their consent before entering into the
scheme (if applicable).
