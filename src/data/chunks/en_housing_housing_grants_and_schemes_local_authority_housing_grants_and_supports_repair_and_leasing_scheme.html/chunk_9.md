####  Agreeing a rental availability agreement

If you decide to make your property available using an RAA, you will sign an
availability agreement with the local authority or AHB. This states that you
have agreed to make your property available for a specific period, to people
nominated by the local authority to be your tenants. And that you will
maintain the property in a lettable condition.
