###  Landlord and tenant arrangements

When the repairs are completed, your property will be offered to households
who have been approved by the local authority for [ social housing
](/en/housing/local-authority-and-social-housing/applying-for-local-authority-
housing/) . If you have agreed a direct lease for your property, tenants will
sign a tenancy agreement with the local authority or AHB. The local authority
or AHB (acting as the landlord) will manage the property and provide support
to its tenants. These properties will not be available to tenants on the [
Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) ](/en/housing/renting-a-home/help-with-
renting/housing-assistance-payment/) or the [ Rental Accommodation Scheme
(RAS) ](/en/housing/local-authority-and-social-housing/rental-accommodation-
scheme/) .

If you have made an RAA with the local authority or AHB, the tenancy agreement
is between you, (the property owner) and the nominated tenant. You are the
landlord, and you have [ landlordâ€™s rights and responsibilities
](/en/housing/renting-a-home/landlords-rights-and-responsibilities/landlords-
rights-and-obligations/) .
