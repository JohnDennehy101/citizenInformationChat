##  Introduction

You can wear a face mask to help stop the spread of COVID-19 and other
infections, but it is no longer mandatory to wear one on public transport,
shops, schools or any other indoor public areas.

If you are wearing a face mask you may be asked to remove your face mask to
verify your age or identity to staff.

Staff in restaurants, pubs, hotels and other hospitality settings do not need
to wear a face mask.
