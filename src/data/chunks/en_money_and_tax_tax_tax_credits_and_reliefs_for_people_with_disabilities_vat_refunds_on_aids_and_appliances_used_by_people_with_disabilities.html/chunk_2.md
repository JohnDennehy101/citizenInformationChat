##  Introduction

If you live in Ireland and you have a physical or mental disability, you may
get a refund of [ Value-Added Tax (VAT) ](/en/money-and-tax/tax/duties-and-
vat/value-added-tax/) on certain aids and appliances that you need.

A refund may also be available to someone who pays for aids and appliances
that are for the exclusive use of someone else who has a disability.

This scheme of VAT refunds on aids and appliances can apply to adaptation and
installation work being carried out to make a home more suitable for an older
person or for a person with a disability – see ‘Housing adaptations’ below.

The scheme does not apply if you have not been charged VAT on your purchase.
For example, wheelchairs are zero-rated for VAT.
