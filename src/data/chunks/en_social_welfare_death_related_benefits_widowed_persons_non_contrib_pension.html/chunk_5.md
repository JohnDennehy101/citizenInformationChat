###  Cash income and income from work

Any cash income you have is assessed in the means test. This includes income
from a social security pension from another country. However, certain items of
cash income are not taken into account in the means test. For example,
earnings of up to €100 per week from employment (but not self-employment) are
not taken into account. Any income from work above €100 is assessed as means.

More information is available in our document about [ cash income not taken
into account in the means test ](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-
system/means-test-for-social-welfare-payments/cash-income-not-included-in-the-
social-welfare-means-test/) .

Any income you get from working as a home help for the HSE is taken into
account in the means test.
