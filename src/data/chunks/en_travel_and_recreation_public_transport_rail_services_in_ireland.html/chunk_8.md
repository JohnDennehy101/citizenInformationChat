##  Services for passengers with disabilities

Special arrangements can be made for passengers with disabilities, but it is
recommended that you contact the relevant station or Iarnród Éireann's
Mobility Impaired Liaison Office at least 24 hours before your journey and
give them some details of your travel plans.

DART trains can be accessed directly from platforms and the trains have wide
doors and a large area to accommodate wheelchairs.

Most mainline and suburban and all DART stations have public address systems
giving details of trains and services for people with visual impairments. You
can read more in our page about [ travelling on public transport with a
disability or reduced mobility ](/en/travel-and-recreation/public-
transport/travelling-publictransport-with-disability/) .
