education-teacher-set-allocation-model-and-the-calculation-of-the-set-
allocation-for-each-school-from-the-202425-school-year/) . This enables a
school to be inclusive and put in place additional teaching support for
students who need it.

The Department of Education provides [ information for parents and guardians
on how your child can get additional teaching support in school (pdf)

If you have concerns with the level of support being given to your child you
should discuss this first with your child’s class teacher or special education
teacher. You could also discuss these issues with the school principal and if
necessary at a later point if you continue to have concerns with the
Chairperson of your Board of Management.

The allocation of special education teachers are being provided on the basis
that no child will be refused enrolment on the grounds that school does not
have sufficient teaching resources to meet that child’s needs. If your child
is refused enrolment to a school you may [ appeal this decision to a Section
29 Appeal Committee ](https://www.gov.ie/en/service/90de23-appeal-against-
permanent-exclusion-suspension-or-refusal-to-enrol/) .
