##  Choosing a post-primary school

When choosing a school, you can consider factors such as:

  * **The admissions policy** : This should be described in the school plan, which the school must publish 
  * **The curriculum:** the range of subjects offered by the school 
  * **School discipline:** Under the [ Education (Welfare) Act 2000 ](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/pdf/2000/en.act.2000.0022.pdf) (pdf) the board of management must draw up a code of behaviour for students 
  * **Programmes and subjects offered** : Junior Cycle programme, Junior Certificate School Programme, Transition Year, established Leaving Certificate, Leaving Certificate Applied, the Leaving Certificate Vocational and other programmes to support personal and social development 
  * **Streaming of students:** Streaming students means dividing them into different classes for all subjects from the time they start secondary school, based on the school's assessment of their ability. 
  * **Assessment of students' progress and feedback to parents and students:** Checking students' progress, feedback to parents, arrangements for parent-teacher meetings 
  * **Facilities:** What student facilities are provided, for example, a library, access to computers, a language laboratory and facilities for lunch, PE and recreation. 
  * **Support services:** guidance counsellor, remedial support for students, pastoral care 
  * **Extra-curricular activities** : such as sports, clubs or debating 
  * **Other factors** include the school ethos (details should be in the school plan); student and parental involvement in the life of the school; whether it has a student council or a parents' association.
