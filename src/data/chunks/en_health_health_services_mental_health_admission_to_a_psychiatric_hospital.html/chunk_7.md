###  **Decision after 24 hours**

After 24 hours, the consultant psychiatrist must then discharge you or arrange
for an examination by another consultant psychiatrist. The second consultant
must issue a certificate stating that you should be detained because of a
mental disorder or they must discharge you.

If you are detained, you are then an involuntary patient and all the
procedures relating to information, review and appeal apply in the usual way.
