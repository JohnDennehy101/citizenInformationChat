###  Leaving a psychiatric hospital

Unlike patients in general hospitals, you are not always completely free to
leave psychiatric care when you want to.

If you are a voluntary patient and want to leave a psychiatric centre and the
consultant psychiatrist or a staff doctor or nurse considers that you are
suffering from a mental health disorder, they may detain you for a maximum of
24 hours.
