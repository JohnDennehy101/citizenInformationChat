##  3\. Examination by a consultant psychiatrist

When you arrive as a patient at an approved psychiatric centre, you must be
examined again by a consultant psychiatrist. You can be detained for up to 24
hours in the centre for this examination.

If the psychiatrist is not satisfied that you are suffering from a mental
disorder, you must be released immediately.
