###  How much does in-patient psychiatric care cost?

If you are ordinarily resident in Ireland, you are entitled to a range of
public health services either free of charge or at reduced cost.

Your [ entitlement to in-patient services
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/health/health-system/entitlement-to-
public-health-services/) and the rules about [ hospital charges
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/health/health-services/gp-and-
hospital-services/hospital-charges/) for psychiatric services are the same as
for general hospitals.
