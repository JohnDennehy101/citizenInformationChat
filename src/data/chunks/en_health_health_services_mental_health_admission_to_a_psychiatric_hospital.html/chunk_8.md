##  Involuntary admission

You may be admitted involuntarily – against your will – and detained in an
approved psychiatric centre if you are suffering from a mental disorder (see
above). This is allowed under the [ Mental Health Act 2001
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/health/health-services/mental-
health/mental-health-act-2001/) .

You cannot be admitted against your will purely because:

  * You have a personality disorder, or 
  * You are socially deviant, or 
  * You are addicted to drugs or intoxicants.
