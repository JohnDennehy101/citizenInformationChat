###  **Renewal order**

A renewal order may extend your admission for a further 3 months. Your
consultant psychiatrist must make the renewal order and they must have
examined you in the week before making the order.

A [ mental health tribunal ](https://www.mhcirl.ie/what-we-do/mental-health-
tribunals) will review your case every time a renewal order is made.

A further renewal order may be made by the same psychiatrist for a further 6
months and after that, for 12 months at a time.

You can read more in our document on the [ rights of psychiatric patients
