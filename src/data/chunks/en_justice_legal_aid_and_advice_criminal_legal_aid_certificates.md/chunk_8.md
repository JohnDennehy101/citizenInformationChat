###  Legal aid (Supreme Court) certificate

If you are appealing a finding of the Court of Appeal to the Supreme Court you
can apply for a legal aid (Supreme Court) certificate. Similarly, if you are
charged with an offence, you can apply for a certificate if you make an appeal
to the Supreme Court about a finding of the High Court on a case stated by a
District Court judge. Where you are appealing a finding of the High Court the
offence must be of a serious nature or exceptional circumstances must apply.

If the application for a legal aid (Supreme Court) certificate is refused, you
can apply to the Supreme Court for a certificate by writing to the registrar
or applying directly to the court.

This certificate entitles you to both a solicitor and barrister.
