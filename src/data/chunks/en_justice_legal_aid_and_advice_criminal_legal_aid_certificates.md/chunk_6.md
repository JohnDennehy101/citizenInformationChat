###  Legal aid (appeal) certificate

If you have been convicted of a criminal offence and you want to appeal that
conviction or the penalty imposed, you can apply for a legal aid (appeal)
certificate. The application is usually made to the court before which you
have been convicted. If the application is refused in that court you can still
get the certificate by applying to the court in which your appeal is to be
heard.

There are two ways of applying to the appeal court:

  * By sending a letter to the registrar of the court stating the facts of the case and the grounds for your appeal 
  * By applying directly to the court itself 

To be eligible for the certificate, the conviction must be for murder, or the
court must be satisfied that due to the serious nature of the offence it is
necessary, in the interests of justice, that you should have legal aid.

The certificate entitles you to a solicitor. If the appeal is to the [ Court
of Appeal ](/en/justice/courts-system/court-of-appeal/) , however, you are
also entitled to a barrister.
