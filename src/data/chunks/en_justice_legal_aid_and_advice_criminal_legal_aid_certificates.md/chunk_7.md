###  Legal aid (case stated) certificate

If you are charged with an offence before the District Court or Circuit Court,
or you are appealing to the Circuit Court against a conviction by the District
Court, the judge who is hearing the case may refer a question of law which
arises from the hearing to the [ High Court ](/en/justice/courts-system/high-
court/) , the [ Court of Appeal ](/en/justice/courts-system/court-of-appeal/)
or the [ Supreme Court ](/en/justice/courts-system/supreme-court/) . This is
known as a case stated. Similarly, the District Court judge hearing the case
may state a case for the opinion of the High Court. In these situations you
can apply for a legal aid (case stated) certificate.

If the application to the District Court or Circuit Court is refused, you can
apply to the court that will hear the case stated. This can be done by:

  * Sending a letter to the registrar of the court setting out the facts of the case and the reason for the application or 
  * Applying directly to the court 

To be eligible the offence must be of a serious nature or exceptional
circumstances must apply. This certificate entitles you to both a solicitor
and barrister.
