###  **Get a BER assessment with an SEAI approved surveyor**

If your home doesn't already have a BER and you want to get one, you can hire
an assessor to do a BER assessment. They will inspect and survey your home
using specialist software which measures:

  * The energy performance and carbon dioxide emissions of your home's heating source such as your gas or oil boiler 
  * Ventilation 
  * Lighting 
  * Water heating source 

SEAI has a [ national register of BER assessors
](https://ndber.seai.ie/PASS/Assessors/Search.aspx) to help you find a BER
assessor in your area.

**What does a BER assessment involve?**

The inspection normally takes between 30 minutes and 1 hour depending on the
size of your home. As part of the inspection, your assessor completes a survey
of each room in the home, including the attic and garage, if you have them.
They also take photographs of different areas of your home as part of the
assessment.

The type of information they record includes:

  * The year the property was built and when any extensions were added 
  * The insulation levels in the walls, roof and floor 
  * The type of building (for example, detached, semi-detached) 
  * The dimensions of your rooms, windows and doors 
  * Details about your baths and showers 
  * Details about your water heating system, ventilation system and lighting 
  * Details about any renewable energy sources 

They will then be able to calculate the annual energy use for heating,
lighting and ventilating your home. When the assessment is complete, your
assessor will give you a BER certificate and an advisory report.

The BER certificate tells you the BER rating of your home and the advisory
report gives you recommendations on how to improve your BER.

**How much does a BER assessment cost?**

The price of a BER assessment can vary depending on the supplier and the size
of your home. The cost for an apartment is around €150, while the cost for a
standard house is between €200 and €300.

You should get at least 3 quotes from different assessors before deciding on
which one to choose.

See SEAI for the [ national register of BER assessors

BER assessors working in Ireland.
