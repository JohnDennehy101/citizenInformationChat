##  What does BER exempt mean?

Some buildings do not need a BER certificate when they are being sold or
rented. These buildings are called BER exempt and include:

  * Stand-alone buildings with floor space of less than 50 square metres 
  * [ Protected structures ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/housing/building-or-altering-a-home/protected-structures/)
  * National monuments 
  * Places of worship or buildings used for religious activities 
  * Non-residential agricultural buildings 
  * Certain temporary buildings 
  * Industrial buildings that are not meant for human occupancy and have an installed heat capacity of less than 10W/m2 

If your house is a protected structure, such as a Georgian house, it will be
BER exempt. However, you can still get a BER assessment if you want one.
