##  How can I improve my BER?

As part of your BER assessment, you will receive an advisory report. This will
give you recommendations on how you can improve energy efficiency in your
home.

You can improve your BER by upgrading the insulation in your home and making
other changes. You may be able to get a grant to help with these.

For more information on these grants, see our pages on [ Grants for a home
energy upgrade ](/en/housing/housing-grants-and-schemes/grants-for-home-
renovations-and-improvements/grants-for-a-home-energy-upgrade/) and [
Individual home energy upgrade grants (Better Energy Homes)
](/en/housing/housing-grants-and-schemes/grants-for-home-renovations-and-
improvements/better-energy-homes-scheme/) .
