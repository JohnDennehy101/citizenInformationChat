###  If you need urgent ongoing care

You can get a temporary medical card for 6 months if you need urgent ongoing
care and need a medical card sooner than the normal processing time.

Your social worker, consultant or GP will send a medical report and a
completed [ application form (pdf) ](https://www2.hse.ie/file-library/medical-
cards/end-of-life-care-medical-card-application-form-mc1e.pdf) to the HSE.

If your application is approved, it can take 10 days to get your emergency
medical card in the post. However, your medical card number will be active
within 24 hours of your application being processed, so you can get the care
you need.

You will need to [ apply for a standard means-tested medical card
](https://www2.hse.ie/services/medical-cards/medical-card-application-
process/how-to-apply-for-a-medical-card.html) before your emergency medical
card expires. The HSE will write to you to remind you to do this.
