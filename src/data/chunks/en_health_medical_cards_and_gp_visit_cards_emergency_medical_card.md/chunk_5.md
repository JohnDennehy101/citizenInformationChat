###  If you are receiving end-of-life treatment

You will get a medical card if you have a terminal illness and you are
receiving end-of-life treatment. End-of-life treatment means you have been
told you have less than 12 months left to live.

Your social worker, consultant or GP will send the HSE a medical report and an
[ End-of-life treatment medical card application form (pdf)
](https://www2.hse.ie/file-library/medical-cards/end-of-life-care-medical-
card-application-form-mc1e.pdf) . A medical officer will process the
application straight away.

Your medical card number will be active on the system within 24 hours of your
application being processed. You can access medical card services while you
wait for your card in the post.

Your medical card will never be reviewed and it will not expire.
