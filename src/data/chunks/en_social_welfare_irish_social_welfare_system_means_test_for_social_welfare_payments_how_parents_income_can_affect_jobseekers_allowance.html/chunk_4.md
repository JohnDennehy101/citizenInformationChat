##  How to calculate benefit and privilege

**Step 1** , add together your parents' net income from all sources. (Net
income is your gross income less income tax, PRSI, [ Universal Social Charge
](/en/money-and-tax/tax/income-tax/universal-social-charge/) , private health
insurance contribution, superannuation and union dues).

For example, your parents' net income includes income from:

  * Insurable employment 
  * Self-employment 
  * Community Employment (CE) schemes and [ Further Education and Training (FET) training allowances ](/en/education/further-education-and-training/training-allowances/)
  * Maintenance payments 
  * An occupational pension 
  * All social welfare payments with the exception of the following: Fuel Allowance, Child Benefit, Guardian's Payment, Domiciliary Care Allowance and Carer's Support Grant. 
  * All Health Service Executive Payments with the exception of the following: Blind Welfare Allowance and Foster Care Allowance. 
  * Net income from property other than the family home. So, for example, rental income (less expenses such as mortgage repayments, insurance costs and repairs) is taken into account. The capital value of property is not taken into account. 

Capital assessment: Capital usually includes saving, investments and property
(other than your home). Capital which belongs to your parents is not taken
into account in the assessment of benefit and privilege.

**Step 2** , deduct the following from your parent’s net income to get their
assessable income:

  * Rent or mortgage repayments 
  * Standard weekly allowance of €600 for a two-parent family or €470 for a one-parent family 
  * €30 for each child up to 18 years of age and for all children over 18 years in full-time education. However, you cannot deduct €30 for a child who is getting a social welfare payment in his/her own right. For example, if there is a child 17 years of age and getting Disability Allowance in the household, you cannot deduct €30 from parental weekly income for this child. The child's social welfare payment is **not** included as income. 

**Step 3** , after you have calculated your parents' assessable income, get
34% of this income. Only **34%** of your parents' assessable income is taken
into account and assessed as benefit and privilege. You subtract this amount
from the standard rate of Jobseeker's Allowance for your circumstances to find
out how much, if any, you qualify for.
