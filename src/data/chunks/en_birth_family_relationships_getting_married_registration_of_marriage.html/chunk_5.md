##  Registering your marriage

If you get married by civil ceremony, the Registrar who solemnised the
marriage will register the marriage with the information on the MRF as soon as
possible after the ceremony.

If you get married by religious or secular ceremony, you should give the MRF
to a Registrar at a [ Civil Registration Service
](https://www2.hse.ie/services/births-deaths-and-marriages/contact-a-civil-
registration-service.html) within 1 month for the marriage to be registered.
It does not have to be returned to the same Registrar who gave it to you.

You cannot get your marriage certificate until your marriage is registered.
