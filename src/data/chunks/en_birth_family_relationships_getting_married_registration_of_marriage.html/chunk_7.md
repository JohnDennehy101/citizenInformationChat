##  Rates

There is no fee charged for the registration of a marriage, or for the
correction of errors on a marriage certificate. Fees are charged for copies of
certificates.

The fees charged for a certificate are as follows:

  * €20 for a full standard certificate 
  * €5 for an uncertified copy of an entry in the Register 
  * €10 to have a certificate authenticated (only available from the General Register Office) 
  * €0 for a Multilingual Standard Form (MSF) 

A Multilingual Standard Form (MSF) can be requested for birth, death, marriage
and civil partnership certificates. A MSF is a translation of the certificate
that you can present to authorities in other EU member states. You must choose
which EU language you want for the MSF, and it must be requested at the same
time as when you apply for the certificate.
