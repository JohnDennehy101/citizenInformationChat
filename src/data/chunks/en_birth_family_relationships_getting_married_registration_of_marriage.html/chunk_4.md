##  What is a Marriage Notification Form?

When you give _notification of your intention to marry_ , and if there is no
impediment (barrier) to your marriage, the Registrar will issue you with a
Marriage Registration Form (MRF) which gives you permission to marry. You need
an MRF in order to get married in Ireland. The MRF is also needed to register
your marriage, so it is an important document.

You should give the MRF to the person who will be solemnising your marriage
before the marriage ceremony. Immediately after the marriage ceremony the MRF
should be signed by you and your spouse, the two witnesses and the person
solemnising the marriage.
