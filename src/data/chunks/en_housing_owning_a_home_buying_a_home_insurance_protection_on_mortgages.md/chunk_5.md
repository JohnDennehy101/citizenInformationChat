##  Types of mortgage protection insurance

There are different types of mortgage protection cover. For example, you can
get:

  * **Reducing term cover** : The amount that this policy covers reduces as you pay off your mortgage and the policy ends when the mortgage is paid off. Your premium does not change, even though the level of cover reduces. This is the most common and cheapest form of mortgage protection. 
  * **Level term cover** : The amount you are insured for remains the same for the term of the mortgage. So, if you die before your mortgage is paid off, the insurance company will pay out the original amount you were insured for. This will pay off the mortgage and any remaining balance will go to your estate. 
  * [ **Serious illness cover** ](https://www.ccpc.ie/consumers/money/insurance/serious-illness-insurance/) : You can add serious illness cover to your mortgage insurance policy. This means your mortgage will be paid off if you are diagnosed with and recover from a serious illness that is covered by your policy. It will also be paid off if you die. This is more expensive than other types of cover. 
  * **Life insurance cover** : You can use an existing life insurance policy as mortgage protection insurance. You can only do this if the life insurance policy provides enough cover and is not assigned to cover another loan or mortgage.
