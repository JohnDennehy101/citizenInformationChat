####  **Calculating fines set before 1997**

If the maximum fine was set before 1997, the value it was set at then is
multiplied by the multiplier for that decade listed in the table below, to
find the current value of the maximum fine.

For example, if the maximum fine was set at €5,000 in 1984, you multiply by 2
to get the current value of €10,000.
