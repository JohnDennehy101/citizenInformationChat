##  What is a domestic worker?

A _domestic worker_ is someone who is employed to carry out duties in a
private home, such as cleaning, cooking, childminding, driving and gardening.
Other duties can include the care of older people or people with disabilities.
Care assistants and [ home helps ](/en/health/health-services/health-services-
for-older-people/home-support-service/) are types of domestic workers.

Domestic workers can work part-time or full-time. Generally, they are hired
directly by the homeowners. Some domestic workers also live with their
employer, for example, _au pairs_ .

People working in other peopleâ€™s home have broadly the same employment rights
as other workers, including the right to a contract, minimum wage, holidays,
and a payslip. This page explains the rights of domestic workers, including
tax obligations.
