###  Deductions from wages

If you get _board and lodgings_ (food and accommodation) as part of your
employment, the employer can deduct this from your wages. However the
deduction must be fair and reasonable, and it must be stated in your contract
of employment. You must be given written notice of the deduction.

The following amounts are included in the minimum wage calculation:

  * **For board (food) only:** €1.14 per hour worked (calculation at hourly rate) 
  * **For lodgings (accommodation) only:** €30 a week or €4.28 a day 

Deductions for other reasons, such as breakages or loss to the employer, must
meet similar criteria. For example, your contract must state that these
deductions can be made. The deduction must be fair, and the employer must give
you written notice of the deduction.
