##  Discrimination at the interview and selection stage

People working in other people’s home have broadly the same employment rights
as other workers. However, ‘access to employment’ is the only area where the
rights of domestic workers differ from those of other workers.

While it is usually illegal to discriminate against prospective employees when
hiring them (for example, at the interview and selection stage), there is an
exception when the job is to be carried out in someone’s home. In this case,
it is not illegal to discriminate against a prospective domestic employee at
the interview and selection stage.

For example, an employer could state that they are looking for a woman to look
after children without being considered ‘discriminatory’. However, once the
employee has taken up the job, they are fully protected by [ employment
equality legislation ](/en/employment/equality-in-work/equality-in-the-
workplace/) .
