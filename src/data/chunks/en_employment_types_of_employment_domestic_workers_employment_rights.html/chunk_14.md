##  An employer’s tax and PRSI obligations

Domestic workers should pay tax, USC and PRSI in the same way as other
employees. If you, the employer, are employing someone to do domestic work
such as housekeeping, care of children or older people, and you are paying
them €40 a week or more, you must [ register as an employer
](https://www.revenue.ie/en/employing-people/becoming-an-employer-and-ongoing-
obligations/registration-of-employers-for-paye-purposes/index.aspx) with
Revenue.

As an employer, you are responsible for deducting the PAYE (tax), PRSI and USC
from your employee’s wages. You also must [ pay employer's PRSI contributions
for your employee ](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/social-
insurance-prsi/paying-social-insurance/) to the Social Insurance Fund. You
must give the employee a [ pay slip ](/en/employment/employment-rights-and-
conditions/pay-and-employment/pay-slip/) with details of the PAYE, PRSI and
USC that has been deducted.
