###  **How to access my medical records using Freedom of Information**

If you want to [ access records under the FOI Act ](/en/government-in-
ireland/how-government-works/standards-and-accountability/freedom-of-
information/) , you should apply to the public body that holds them.

If you have a medical card, the HSE holds the records of medical card holders.

If the head of the public body believes that giving you the information may be
harmful to your health or emotional well-being, they can instead give the
medical records to a health professional that you choose.

If you have a dispute about access to records under the FOI Act, you should
contact the [ Office of the Information Commissioner ](http://www.oic.ie/) .
