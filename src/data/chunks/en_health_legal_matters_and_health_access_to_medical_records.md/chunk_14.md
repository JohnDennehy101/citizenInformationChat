##  Open disclosure and your right to patient safety information

If certain serious patient safety incidents happen during your care, you and
your family must be told by the healthcare body. This is known as the
mandatory open disclosure policy and was introduced by the [ Patient Safety
(Notifiable Incidents and Open Disclosure) Act 2023
](https://www.oireachtas.ie/en/bills/bill/2019/100/) on 26 September 2024.

The act contains a list of the specific patient safety incidents you must be
told about such as serious injury or death.

Your right to patient safety information applies to private and public health
providers. These include:

  * The HSE 
  * Private Hospitals 
  * Private health and social care providers such as GPs, Dentists and Pharmacists 
  * Other HSE funded organisations 

They must also notify the appropriate regulatory body such as the [ Health
Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) ](https://www.hiqa.ie/) , or the [
Mental Health Commission (MHC)
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/health/health-services/mental-
