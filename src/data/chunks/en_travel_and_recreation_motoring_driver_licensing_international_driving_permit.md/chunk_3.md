##  Where can I use my International Driving Permit?

You can use your international driving permit in any of the countries that
have signed the 1926 or 1949 UN Convention on road traffic. See the [
application form (pdf) ](https://www.theaa.ie/wp-
content/uploads/2023/11/AA_IDP-Application202310-1.pdf) for a list of
countries that recognise the permit.

Many other countries that are not signatories to the 1949 convention recognise
the international driving permit and accept it. You should contact your
embassy or consulate in advance of travelling to confirm if it is recognized
by them.
