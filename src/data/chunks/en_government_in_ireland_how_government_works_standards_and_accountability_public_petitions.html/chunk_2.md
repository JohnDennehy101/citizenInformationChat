raise issues of general public interest with the [ Houses of the Oireachtas
(parliament)
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/government_in_ireland/houses_of_the_oireachtas/)

Decisions about petitions are made by the [ Joint Committee on Public
Petitions ](https://www.oireachtas.ie/en/committees/33/petitions/) , which is
a parliamentary committee consisting of TDs and Senators.
