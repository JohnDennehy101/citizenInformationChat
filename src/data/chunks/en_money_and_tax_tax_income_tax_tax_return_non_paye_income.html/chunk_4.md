###  When do I have to self-assess my tax if I am a PAYE taxpayer?

If you only have PAYE income, you do not need to self-assess your tax.

If you have PAYE income but you also have income from non-PAYE sources, you
must make a tax return under self-assessment if the non-PAYE income amounts
to:

  * Taxable net income (after losses, capital allowances and other reliefs) of €5,000 or more in a year. 

_or_

  * Total gross income of €30,000 or more in a year. This applies even if you do not owe any tax on this income because it is reduced by losses, capital allowances or other tax reliefs. 

If you have to self-assess your tax, this is known as being a _chargeable
person_ .
