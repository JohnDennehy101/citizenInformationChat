##  Signing on for credits only and the student grant

If you are signing on for credits only, and you meet the qualifying period,
you can take part in the BTEA. You continue to get your credits. You can also
apply for both the fee and maintenance components of the student grant and a
postgraduate fee contribution (if relevant).
