###  Maintenance grant and BTEA

**You cannot get a maintenance grant and a BTEA or a VTOS allowance
together.**

If you have completed a course and now wish to progress to a course at a
higher level, you can continue to retain your BTEA payment (generally up to
and including level 8 on the National Framework of Qualifications). However,
you will no longer be entitled to the maintenance component of the student
grant. You can apply under the grant scheme to have the student contribution
and any tuition fees/field trip costs paid on your behalf under the fee
component of the student grant (if you qualify) and for a postgraduate fee
contribution (if relevant).
