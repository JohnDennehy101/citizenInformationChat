##  Introduction

If you are returning to education and have been getting a social welfare
payment you may qualify for the Back to Education Allowance or the student
grant depending on your circumstances. You cannot get the Back to Education
Allowance (BTEA) and a full student grant at the same time.

If you are getting One-Parent Family Payment (OFP), Jobseeker's Transitional
payment, Disability Allowance, Invalidity Pension or Illness Benefit, you will
need to assess whether it is more beneficial for you to transfer to the BTEA
when you go back to education or to remain on your current payment and apply
for a student grant. If you are receiving Jobseeker’s Benefit or Jobseeker’s
Allowance, you must transfer to the BTEA if you wish to keep a social welfare
payment when you go back to education. People who have transferred from OFP to
the Jobseeker's Transitional payment can attend a full-time course.

Since 2015, if you are a new BTEA applicant and you were getting a jobseeker’s
payment, Farm Assist, a One-Parent Family Payment or a Jobseeker's
Transitional payment, you must re-establish your entitlement to a primary
payment to continue to be entitled to BTEA for the second or subsequent years
of study.

This document outlines your options.
