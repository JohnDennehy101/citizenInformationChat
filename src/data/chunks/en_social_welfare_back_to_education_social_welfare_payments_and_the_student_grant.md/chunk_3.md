##  Back to Education Allowance

The [ Back to Education Allowance (BTEA) ](/en/social-welfare/back-to-
education/back-to-education-allowance/) allows people getting certain social
welfare payments to get a social welfare payment while participating in
approved full-time courses in further and higher education. People taking part
in the BTEA scheme are paid a weekly allowance equivalent to the social
welfare payment they were getting before starting their course.
