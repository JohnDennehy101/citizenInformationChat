##  Workplace mediation

When you make a complaint under equality legislation, you may be offered [
workplace mediation ](/en/employment/enforcement-and-redress/workplace-
mediation/) . Mediation is a voluntary, private and confidential process,
unlike adjudication hearings which are usually held in public – see
‘Adjudication’ below.

Mediation can be carried out by phone, video, or face-to-face meetings.

During mediation, a mediator helps you and your employer come to an agreement.
At the end of mediation, both sides sign an agreement which is legally
binding. This means both sides must keep to the terms of the decision. The
agreement is not published.

If you do not reach an agreement through mediation, you can ask for your case
to be brought to adjudication - see 'Adjudication' below.
