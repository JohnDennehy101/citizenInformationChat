##  Introduction

The [ Workplace Relations Commission (WRC) ](/en/employment/enforcement-and-
redress/workplace-relations-commission/) deals with all complaints of
discrimination in employment and access to goods and services.

If you complain to the WRC about an equality or discrimination dispute, your
complaint will either be handled using _mediation_ or _adjudication_ – see
more below.

These complaints come under the following equality legislation:

**The legislation** |  **What the legislation does**  
---|---  
The Employment Equality Acts 1998–2015  |  These Acts ban discrimination at work.  They cover discrimination about:  Recruitment and promotion  Equal pay  Working conditions  Training or experience  Dismissal  Harassment, including sexual harassment.  Read more about [ Equality in the workplace ](../equality_in_work/equality_in_the_workplace.en.html) .   
The Equal Status Acts 2000–2015  |  These Acts ban discrimination outside the workplace, in particular in:  The provision of goods and services  Selling, renting or leasing property (including the " [ housing assistance ground ](https://www.ihrec.ie/your-rights/advertising/housing-assistance-payment/) ")  Certain aspects of education.   
  
_Victimisation_ is also covered by equality legislation. Victimisation occurs
when a person is treated less favourably than another person because they
opposed discrimination, or were involved in a complaint of unlawful
discrimination. Read more about [ victimisation at work
](/en/employment/enforcement-and-redress/victimisation-at-work/) .

The Workplace Relations Commission also deals with complaints of
discrimination on the grounds of gender under the [ Pensions Acts 1990–2015
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1990/en/act/pub/0025/index.html) in relation
to occupational benefit or pensions schemes.
