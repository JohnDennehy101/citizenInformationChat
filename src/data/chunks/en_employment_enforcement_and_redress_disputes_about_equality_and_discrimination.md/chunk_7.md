####  Complaint under the Equal Status Acts 2000–2015

You must first tell the person or organisation you are making the complaint
against **within 2 months** of the last act of discrimination.

To do this, you complete [ ES.1 form (pdf)
](https://www.workplacerelations.ie/en/Publications_Forms/Form-ES-1-Equal-
Status-Complaint-Notification1.pdf) and send it to the person or organisation
you are making the complaint against. The time limit for notification can be
extended to 4 months by the Director General of the Workplace Relations
Commission.

If you are not happy with the person's or organisation’s response, or if they
have not responded within 1 month from the date you notified them, you can
take your complaint to the WRC using [ the online complaint form
](https://www.workplacerelations.ie/en/complaints_disputes/refer_a_dispute_make_a_complaint/)
. Read about [ how to make a complaint ](/en/employment/enforcement-and-
