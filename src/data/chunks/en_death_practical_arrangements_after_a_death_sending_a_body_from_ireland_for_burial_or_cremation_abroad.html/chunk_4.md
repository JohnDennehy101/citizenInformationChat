##  Registration and other formalities

The death must be registered in Ireland. To [ register a death
](/en/death/practical-arrangements-after-a-death/registering-a-death/) , you
need a Death Notification Form signed by a doctor. When you have this signed
form, you must register the death as soon as possible with the local Registrar
of Births, Marriages and Deaths. The registrar will issue a death certificate.

However, if a coroner has asked for a [ post-mortem ](/en/death/sudden-or-
unexplained-death/postmortems/) (a medical examination to determine the cause
of death), the coroner will arrange for the death to be registered. Getting
the death certificate may be delayed until the post-mortem has established the
cause of death.
