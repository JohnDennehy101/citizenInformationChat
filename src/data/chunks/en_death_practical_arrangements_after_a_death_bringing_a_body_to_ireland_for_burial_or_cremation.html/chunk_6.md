##  Unexplained deaths

If the death was sudden or unexplained the coroner in Ireland for the district
where the body is being taken must be notified of the repatriation. If you
have appointed a funeral director in Ireland, the funeral director will
contact the appropriate coroner with the required documentation. If the
remains are being flown into Dublin airport, it is the [ Dublin District
Coroner ](https://www.dublincoronerscourt.ie/) who must be notified.

If there are concerns about how the death happened, the coroner may direct
that a post-mortem or an additional examination of the body be carried out. [
