##  Appointing a funeral director

If you appoint a [ funeral director ](/en/death/after-a-death/funerals#l47eff)
in Ireland they can find a suitable funeral director in the other country and
make the appropriate arrangements. Alternatively, the [ Irish embassy for the
country ](https://www.ireland.ie/en/dfa/embassies/) can provide help to Irish
citizens in appointing a local funeral director. If the death occurred on a [
package holiday ](/en/consumer/travel/package-holidays/) , the tour operator
should be able to help with arrangements. A funeral director is someone whose
business is to prepare the dead for burial and to arrange and manage funerals.
Services of funeral directors are not free so you should check fees and costs
associated prior to engaging these services.

The local funeral director can prepare the body for repatriation. The funeral
director can also prepare the appropriate documentation and obtain the death
certificate if possible. Assistance is also available from the Irish embassy
in obtaining documents such as the death certificate or medical reports. The
local funeral director can also make all the necessary flight arrangements.
