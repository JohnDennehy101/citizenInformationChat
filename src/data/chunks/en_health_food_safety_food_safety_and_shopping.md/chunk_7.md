When packing your food into shopping bags, you should keep:

  * Frozen foods together 
  * Refrigerated foods together 
  * Hot foods separated from cold foods 
  * Delicate foods, such as bread and eggs, at the top of the bag 
  * Heavy items at the bottom of the bag 

You will not be subject to the [ Plastic Bag Environmental Levy
](/en/environment/waste-and-recycling/littering-and-dumping/) if you use a
smaller plastic bag to store meat, fish and poultry products, regardless of
whether they are packaged or unpackaged. In addition, you will not be subject
to the levy if you use smaller plastic bags to store non-packaged food.
