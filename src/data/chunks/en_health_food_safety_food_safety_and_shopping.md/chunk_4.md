##  'Best before' and use-by dates

Always check your food’s _best before_ and _use-by_ dates before buying and
eating it.

The **best before** date (sometimes written as ‘BBE’) tells you when the
quality of the food will start to get worse, for example, the colour or
texture might change. It may still be safe to eat. The best before date only
applies if you have stored the food according to the instructions on the
packaging.

Food that has passed its **use-by date** is not safe to eat and should be
thrown out.

**Why are there no ‘best before’ or ‘use-by’ date on my food?**

These dates do not have to be declared on foods that are not pre-packed.

Some food shops do not have 'best before' dates on foods such as fresh bread,
fruit and vegetables to help reduce food waste. You are encouraged to use your
own judgement. [ Read more on Safe Food Ireland.
