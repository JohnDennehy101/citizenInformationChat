##  Self-service bars

Never touch the food with your hands and do not sneeze or cough near the food.
If you see anyone mishandling the food, report it to a member of staff.

Each food should have its own utensil, such as a spoon or tongs.

Self-service salads should be in a chilled unit to keep them fresh.

You should also follow the supermarket's instructions carefully. For example,
some food may need to be eaten within a certain time.
