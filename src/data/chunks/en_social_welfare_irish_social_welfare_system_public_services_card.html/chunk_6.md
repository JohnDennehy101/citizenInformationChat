##  What is SAFE and SAFE registration?

SAFE stands for Standard Authentication Framework Environment. SAFE
registration is the process the Department of Social Protection uses to check
and confirm a personâ€™s identity. Once your identity has been verified, you can
be issued with a Public Services Card (PSC).

Contact your local [ PSC/SAFE Registration Centre
](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/be29c7-psc-online-registration-centres/)
to make an appointment to get registered. Your local registration centre is
usually your [ local Intreo Centre
](https://www.gov.ie/en/directory/category/e1f4b5-intreo-offices/) . Some [
PSC Centres ](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/be29c7-psc-online-
registration-centres/) have a walk-in service and no appointment is necessary.
Check before you go.
