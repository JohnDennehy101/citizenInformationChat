###  Moving to a nursing home

The vast majority of older people are able to live in their own homes with
some support from their families, neighbours and the health and community care
services. But, if you can no longer manage at home even with this support, you
may need to consider [ moving to long-term care ](/en/health/health-
services/health-services-for-older-people/moving-from-home-to-long-term-care/)
. Long-term care includes public and private nursing homes as well geriatric
hospitals and community nursing units.

You can apply for financial support to help pay for the cost of nursing home
care through the [ Fair Deal Scheme ](/en/health/health-services/health-
services-for-older-people/fair-deal-scheme/) . This is where you pay a certain
amount towards the cost of your care and the HSE pays the rest.
