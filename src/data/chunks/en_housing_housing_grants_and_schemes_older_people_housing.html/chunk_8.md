###  Adapting your home so it’s more accessible

As you get older you may need to [ adapt your home ](/en/housing/building-or-
altering-a-home/adapting-a-home-for-an-older-or-disabled-person/) so you can
continue to live there independently. There are many alterations that can make
your home more suitable, if your mobility has become limited. For example, you
can move your bathroom or bedroom downstairs or install grab rails, a stair
lift or level access shower. If you want to adapt your home you should contact
an [ occupational therapist ](/en/health/health-services/care-in-your-
community/occupational-therapy-services/) who will assess your needs and
advise you about equipment and adaptations. You may be able to get grants
towards the cost of these adaptations, see ‘What grants can I get to adapt my
home’ below.
