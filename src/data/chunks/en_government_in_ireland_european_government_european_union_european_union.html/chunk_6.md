##  EU citizenship and rights

Citizens of EU member states are also automatically citizens of the European
Union. EU citizens have certain rights, including:

  * The right to move freely and to live within the EU. This right also applies to the EU citizenâ€™s family. 
  * The right to equal treatment. 
  * The right to have their affairs handled fairly and impartially by EU institutions and bodies, and the right to refer maladministration to the European Ombudsman. 
  * The right to access documents held on them by EU institutions. 
  * The right to diplomatic or consular assistance when traveling outside the EU in a country where their own country does not operate an embassy or consulate. 
  * The presumption of innocence until found guilty by a court of law, the right not to be tried twice for the same offence, and the protection of other general principals of the rule of law.
