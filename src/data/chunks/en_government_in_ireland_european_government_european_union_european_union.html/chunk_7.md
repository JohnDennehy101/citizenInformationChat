##  Economic governance

The EU, through the European Commission, tries to prevent economic shocks by
monitoring the economies of member states. The Commission publishes two annual
reports that try to address any economic problems it may have noticed during
the year. They are:

  * The [ Annual Growth Survey ](https://commission.europa.eu/publications/2023-european-semester-annual-sustainable-growth-survey_en)
  * [ Alert Mechanism Report ](https://ec.europa.eu/info/business-economy-euro/economic-and-fiscal-policy-coordination/eu-economic-governance-monitoring-prevention-correction/macroeconomic-imbalances-procedure/alert-mechanism-report_en)

EU member states must present their draft budgets each year to the Commission
and member states can be asked to change their budgets if the Commission
thought they were in breach of the Stability and Growth Pact.

The Stability and Growth Pact also has rules on the level of debt that member
states can have, and introduced procedures for member states to follow if
their government deficit increases above 3% of the member stateâ€™s gross
domestic product.
