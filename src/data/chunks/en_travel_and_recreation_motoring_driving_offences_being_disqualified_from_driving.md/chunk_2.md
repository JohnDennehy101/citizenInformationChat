##  Introduction

Driving offences in Ireland are set out in the [ Road Traffic Acts 1961 (as
amended)
](https://revisedacts.lawreform.ie/eli/1961/act/24/front/revised/en/html) .

Penalties on conviction for a driving offence vary and are determined
principally by the severity of the offence and the number of offences you have
committed in the past. They can include monetary fines, endorsement of your
driving licence [ with penalty points ](https://www.rsa.ie/en/RSA/Licensed-
Drivers/Penalty-points/How-it-works-why-it-matters/) , disqualification from
driving and, in the most severe cases, [ imprisonment ](/en/justice/criminal-
law/criminal-trial/types-of-sentences/) .

This page outlines the rules governing the disqualification of driving licence
holders in Ireland.

It includes information on:

  * The operation of disqualification orders 
  * The various types of disqualification orders; and 
  * How to apply for the restoration of your licence after being disqualified 

The disqualification of drivers and the enforcement of the various provisions
is a [ shared responsibility
](http://www.justice.ie/en/JELR/Pages/RoadTrafficMatters) of the [ Road Safety
Authority (RSA) ](https://www.rsa.ie/) , the [ Department of Transport
](https://www.gov.ie/en/organisation/department-of-transport-tourism-and-
sport/) , the [ Courts Service ](https://www.courts.ie/) and [ An Garda
