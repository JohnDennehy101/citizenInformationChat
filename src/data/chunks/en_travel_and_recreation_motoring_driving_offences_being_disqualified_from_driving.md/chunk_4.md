###  Disqualification through penalty points

A [ penalty point ](/en/travel-and-recreation/motoring/driving-
offences/penalty-points-for-driving-offences/) is essentially a formal
reprimand by the Gardaí endorsed on your driving licence record that shows you
are guilty of a specific driving offence.

Penalty points are recorded on your driving licence when:

  * You are convicted in court of a driving offence that attracts penalty points; or 
  * You pay [ a fixed charge notice ](/en/travel-and-recreation/motoring/driving-offences/driving-offences/) that was issued to you for an offence that also carries penalty points 

If you get 12 penalty points in any 3 year period, you are automatically
disqualified from driving for 6 months.

Similarly, [ learner permit drivers ](/en/travel-and-
recreation/motoring/driver-licensing/learner-driving-permits-for-cars-and-
work-vehicles/) and new drivers who are within two years of receiving their
first full licence are disqualified if they get 7 penalty points.

If you exceed your penalty point threshold, you will receive a letter from
either the Courts Service or the RSA indicating the date on which your period
of disqualification will begin and requesting that you surrender your licence
within 14 days of that date (for more see, ‘Surrendering your licence’ below).
