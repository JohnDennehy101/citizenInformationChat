###  2\. Ancillary Disqualification

An ancillary disqualification is within the discretion of the court to apply
and can be imposed as a penalty for any offence under the Road Traffic Act
1961 which does not mandate consequential disqualification. The court will
decide how long the disqualification order will last based on the severity of
the offence and the perceived likelihood of the perpetrator re-offending.

For example, if you are convicted of driving without due care and attention,
the law does not require that you be disqualified from driving (a
consequential disqualification). But if you have a record of driving offences,
the court may determine it proportional to impose an ancillary
disqualification order.

If an ancillary disqualification order is made by a court, the driver
generally has 10 days to surrender their licence.
