###  Marketing and advertising

Marketing or advertising sales practices are misleading if it causes you to
confuse:

  * A competitor's product with the trader's product 
  * A competitor's trade name or trademark, or some other distinguishing feature or mark, with that of the trader 
  * A branded product as being identical to products in another EU Member State, when it has significantly different composition or characteristics
