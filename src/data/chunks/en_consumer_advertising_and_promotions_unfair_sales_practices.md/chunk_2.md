##  What are unfair sales practices?

When you buy goods, services and digital content and services in Ireland or
the EU, consumer law protects you against unfair sales practices.

Many unfair, misleading and aggressive sales practices are banned (prohibited)
if they harm or are likely to harm you.

A sales practice is considered ‘unfair’ if it meets these conditions:

  * It is misleading (giving false information or leaving out important information) or aggressive (putting pressure on you to buy) 
  * It is likely to distort your buying decision
