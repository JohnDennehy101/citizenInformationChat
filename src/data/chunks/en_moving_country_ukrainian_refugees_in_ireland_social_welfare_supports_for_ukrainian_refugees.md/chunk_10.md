##  Collecting your social welfare payment

You collect your first social welfare payment at [ your nearest Post Office
](https://www.anpost.com/#storelocator) , called An Post.

The Department of Social Protection will send you a letter to let you know
when your payment will be at the Post Office for you to collect.

You need to bring your ‘PPS number award letter’ and your ID with you to
collect your payment at the Post Office.

You can [ use MyWelfare to change the Post Office
](https://services.mywelfare.ie/en/topics/ukraine-emergency-supports/ukraine-
change-of-post-office/) where you are being paid. You can only use this
service if you are covered by the EU Temporary Protection Directive.
