##  Introduction

The [ Gambling Regulatory Authority of Ireland (GRAI)
](https://www.gov.ie/en/campaigns/5693a-gambling-regulatory-authority-of-
ireland/) is a new statutory body that will be responsible for the licensing
and regulation of gambling services in Ireland. The GRAI will be independent
in the performance of its functions.

The GRAI has not been established yet. The new regulator will focus on public
safety and wellbeing, will cover gambling online and in person, and will have
powers to regulate advertising, gambling, websites, and apps.

Licensing and regulation of gambling in Ireland is currently based on several
pieces of legislation. The new legislation, which will establish the GRAI,
will repeal existing laws and will streamline the approach to licensing and
regulation of gambling in Ireland.

The National Lottery will not be covered by the new legislation and will
remain separately regulated.
