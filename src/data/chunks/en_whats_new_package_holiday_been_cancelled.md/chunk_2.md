Has your package holiday been cancelled? 🤯

If the travel organiser cancels the package holiday or changes the terms of
the contract, they must give you one of these options:

  * A replacement holiday of the same or better quality ⛱️ 
  * A lower grade holiday, with a refund of the price difference 🌦️ 
  * A full refund within 14 days 💸
