###  Changes meaning you qualify for extra payments

Some extra payments, such as the [ Fuel Allowance ](/en/social-welfare/extra-
social-welfare-benefits/fuel-allowance/) , the [ Living Alone Allowance
](/en/social-welfare/extra-social-welfare-benefits/living-alone-allowance/) or
the [ Household Benefits Package ](/en/social-welfare/extra-social-welfare-
benefits/household-benefits-package/) as it applies to people under age 70,
require you to either live alone or with certain qualified people. If you do
not qualify because of this rule and your circumstances change, you should
contact the Department of Social Protection.

You may also lose the payment if an 'unqualified' person comes to live with
you.
