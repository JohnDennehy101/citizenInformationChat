###  Changes meaning you qualify for a reduced social welfare payment

If you or your spouse, civil partner or cohabitant take up employment or get
income or capital from any other source, it may reduce your payment.

If you or your spouse, civil partner or cohabitant save a portion of your
State Pension (Non-Contributory) each week, these savings will be taken into
account as means. It is important to notify the Department of Social
Protection of these savings to avoid [ an overpayment ](/en/social-
