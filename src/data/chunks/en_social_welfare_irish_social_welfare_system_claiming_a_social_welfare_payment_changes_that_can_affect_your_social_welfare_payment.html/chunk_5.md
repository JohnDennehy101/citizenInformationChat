###  Changes meaning you qualify for a different social welfare payment

A change in your circumstances may mean you no longer qualify for the payment
you are currently getting but qualify for a different payment. In some cases,
you may be financially better off on the different payment. For example,
Domiciliary Care Allowance is no longer paid when the person being cared for
reaches 16 years of age. However, the person with the disability can apply for
[ Disability Allowance ](/en/social-welfare/disability-and-illness/disability-
allowance/) , which is paid at a higher rate than [ Domiciliary Care Allowance
](/en/social-welfare/disability-and-illness/domiciliary-care-allowance/) .
