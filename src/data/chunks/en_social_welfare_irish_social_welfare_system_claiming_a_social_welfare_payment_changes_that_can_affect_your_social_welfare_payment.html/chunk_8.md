###  Changes meaning you no longer qualify for a social welfare payment

A change in your circumstances may mean you no longer qualify for a social
welfare payment. For example, you are not entitled to Widow's, Widower's or
Surviving Civil Partner's Pension if you remarry or enter into a new civil
partnership or cohabit with someone else.

It is a criminal offence to claim a social welfare payment, if you know you
are not entitled to it. You [ can be prosecuted for claiming a social welfare
payment that you are no longer entitled to ](https://www.gov.ie/en/press-
