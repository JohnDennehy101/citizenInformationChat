###  New stamp duty exemption for sporting bodies

A new exemption from stamp duty is being introduced for those sporting bodies
covered by Section 235 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, which are already
entitled to relief from income tax and capital gains tax, subject to certain
conditions. The exemption will relate to purchases of land for the purposes of
promoting games or sports.
