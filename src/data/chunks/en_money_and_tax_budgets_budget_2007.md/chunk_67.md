###  Employment  

As announced in Budget 2006, in March 2007 the duration of paid maternity
leave will increase by 4 weeks to 26 weeks and additional unpaid maternity
leave will increase by 4 weeks to 16 weeks. This brings the total of paid and
unpaid maternity leave to 42 weeks. This increase will apply to women starting
maternity leave on or after 1 March 2007.  
  
The maximum earnings limit for Maternity Benefit is increased to €350 a week
and the minimum rate of payment is increased to €207.80 a week.  
  
As a result of the increase in tax credits and tax bands the entry point at
which people start paying tax is €17,600. This means that employees who are
paid the national minimum wage rate will be below the thresholds for paying
tax.  
  
The employee tax credit will increase by €270 to €1,760.
