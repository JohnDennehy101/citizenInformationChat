###  Vehicle Registration Tax (VRT) - Public Consultation

It is planned to change the current VRT system to take greater account of
environmental issues, in particular carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. A public
consultation will be undertaken in this regard with a view to making such a
move with effect from a target date of 1 January 2008. Submissions are invited
from interested parties by 1 March 2007.  
  
Submissions are also being invited from interested parties, by 1 March 2007,
in relation to the rebalancing of annual motor tax to provide an incentive for
the motoring public to drive cleaner cars and to impose penalties in respect
of cars with higher (CO2) emission levels.
