###  Increase in threshold for CGT retirement relief

An exemption from CGT applies in the case of individuals aged 55 and over who
dispose of qualifying business or farming assets subject to certain
conditions. Disposals made to a child or favourite niece/nephew are relieved
in full. All other disposals are relieved up to the threshold of €500,000.
This threshold is being increased from €500,000 to €750,000 from 1 January
2007.
