###  DIRT administration change

DIRT can currently be refunded to an individual who is exempt from income tax
if the person or the personâ€™s spouse is over 65 years of age or permanently
incapacitated. The rules relating to such individuals are now being changed so
that in future they may notify their financial institution of their status and
receive the interest without deduction of DIRT. These changes will be included
in the 2007 Finance Bill.
