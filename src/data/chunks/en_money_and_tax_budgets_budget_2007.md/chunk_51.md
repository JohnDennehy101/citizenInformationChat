###  Capital Acquisitions Tax agricultural relief – off-farm principal private
residences

CAT agricultural relief provides relief from CAT on 90% of the value of a gift
or inheritance. In order to qualify for the relief, 80% of a farmer’s total
assets (after receipt of the gift/inheritance) must consist of qualifying
agricultural assets. Off-farm principal private residences are not considered
such assets for the purposes of this relief. This provision is now being
amended so that an individual may off-set borrowings on an off-farm principal
private residence against the property’s value, for the purpose of the 80%
test.
