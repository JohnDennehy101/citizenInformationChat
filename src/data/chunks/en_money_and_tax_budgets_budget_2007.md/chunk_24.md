###  Childminding relief

Budget 2006 introduced an exemption of up to €10,000 per annum on income from
childminding where an individual minds up to three children, who are not their
own, in the minder’s own home. If childminding income exceeds this the total
amount is taxable, as normal, under self-assessment. The €10,000 limit is
being increased to €15,000.
