###  Review of VAT on property transactions - public consultation

The Revenue Commissioners, over the last two years, have carried out a review
of the current system of applying VAT on property transactions. The review
recommends significant changes to the system. It is planned to engage in a
wide consultation process with interested parties before deciding on any
changes which might appropriately be implemented in the 2008 Finance Act.
