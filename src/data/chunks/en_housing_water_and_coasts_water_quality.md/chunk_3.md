##  Lead and drinking water

Lead is a danger to your health, and especially dangerous for young children,
pregnant women and babies fed on formula, so water for drinking and cooking
should contain as little lead as possible. Sometimes, lead can be in drinking
water, as lead piping, lead solder and lead-lined water tanks were often used
in plumbing in the past and your water may travel through these older plumbing
systems. The legal level of lead in drinking water is **10 micrograms per
litre** .

If you think there might be lead in your drinking water, you can [ contact
Uisce Éireann ](https://www.water.ie/contact/) for advice. If you do not get
your water from Uisce Éireann, contact your group scheme or your local
authority.

If you are from a low-income household you may be able to get a [ grant scheme
](https://www.gov.ie/en/service/6e885-domestic-lead-remediation-grant-scheme/)
help with the cost of remediating domestic lead piping.
