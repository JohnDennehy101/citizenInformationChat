###  Monitoring of small water schemes and wells

As noted above, for group water schemes that do not supply more than 50 people
or produce more than 10 cubic metres of water per day, the same standards
apply but the quality is not monitored under the Regulations. Whoever is
responsible for the scheme is responsible for monitoring the water quality.

Similarly, if your water supply comes from a private well, you are responsible
for monitoring the quality of your own supply. You must bear the cost of the
testing yourself and if your supply is contaminated, you must organise and pay
for any treatment that is needed.

The HSE publishes [ detailed information on the risk of illness from well
water (pdf) ](http://www.lenus.ie/hse/bitstream/10147/294332/2/A4_Precautions
and advice for reducing risk of illness from well water.pdf) . It recommends
that wells should be tested at least once a year for microbial contamination,
and at least once every 3 years for chemical contamination. It also publishes
information on the [ risks of switching from a public to a private water
supply (pdf)
](http://www.lenus.ie/hse/bitstream/10147/281381/7/SwitchingfromPublictoPrivateDrinkingWaterSuppliesHSEDGroupFeb2011.pdf)
.

To get your water supply checked, contact the local authority or HSE
Environmental Health Officer in the first instance. Alternatively, you can
arrange to have a sample tested using a private laboratory. It is not
recommended that you take a water sample yourself as equipment has to be
sterile.

The EPA has published [ extensive information for householders
](http://www.epa.ie/water/dw/hhinfo/) on protecting private wells.
