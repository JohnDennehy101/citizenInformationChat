###  Health Service Executive (HSE)

Under the Regulations, the HSE must be informed whenever poor water quality
poses a potential danger to human health. The local authority then prepares an
action programme in consultation with and with the agreement of the HSE.

In some areas, the Environmental Health section in the Local Health Office
monitors water supplies on behalf of the local authority to make sure that all
water sources meet the required public health standards. The HSE is also
responsible for monitoring the fluoride content of public water supplies.

The HSE can also (for a fee) analyse water from a private source, such as a
well. The fee cannot be more than the cost of the monitoring.

As noted above, the HSE also publishes [ advice and guidance
](http://www.hse.ie/eng/health/hl/water/drinkingwater/) on the dangers to
human health caused by poor water quality.
