###  Private water supplies

Private water supplies include private group water schemes, public group water
schemes and other private supplies such as a water supply owned by a
developer. This category also includes small supplies that provide water to
the public.

A **private** group water scheme is one where the entire water supply
(including the source, treatment plant and distribution network) is owned by a
group of community trustees. These are commonly members of the [ National
Federation of Group Water Schemes ](http://www.nfgws.ie/Home) .

A **public** group water scheme is where the water comes from a public
drinking water supply but the distribution system is owned by a group water
scheme.

Local authorities often monitor private supplies on behalf of their owners or
trustees. Some of them employ the HSE to test the water quality and some do it
themselves. The trustees or owners of the supply pay the local authority for
this service.

The local authority is the supervisory authority over private water supplies.
They have the same role that the EPA has for public supplies. If a private
water supply falls below the EC standards, the local authority notifies the
trustees of the scheme or the owners. The trustees or owners must submit an
action programme to the local authority which will address the problem within
a certain timescale. The local authority has legal enforcement powers if
appropriate action is not taken.

The HSE is informed if there is a potential danger to human health from all
regulated water supplies (public and private) The HSE agrees remedial actions
with the local authority for the protection of public health.
