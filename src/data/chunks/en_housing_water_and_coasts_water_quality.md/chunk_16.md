###  Rural Water Programme and monitoring committees

The local authorities administer the [ Rural Water Programme
](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/a524a-group-water-schemes-and-rural-water-
issues/#rural-water-programme) , which aims to improve the quality and
efficiency of group water schemes, small public water and sewerage schemes,
and private supplies where no alternative group or public supply is available.

Each county has a strategic rural water plan, pinpointing areas needing
improvement and deciding how to make the most of grants and subsidies
available for improving and maintaining water supply systems. Local
authorities have compiled an inventory of group schemes and take note of the
quality of their water supply. The overall aim of the plan must be to deliver
water as efficiently and effectively as possible.

[ An Fóram Uisce ](https://www.thewaterforum.ie/) monitors and advises on the
development and implementation of policy on the Rural Water Programme. There
are local committees in each county to enable water consumers to have a say in
how the Programme is implemented. Each local authority has a County Liaison
Officer to deal with day-to-day issues brought up by the Programme’s
implementation.
