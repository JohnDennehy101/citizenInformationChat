###  Public water supplies

The EPA is the supervisory authority for public water supplies. Uisce Éireann
is responsible for monitoring such supplies and for informing the EPA of non-
compliant water monitoring results. Your local authority prepares short-term
and long-term plans to address the problem, for approval by the EPA. The EPA
has legal enforcement powers if appropriate action is not taken.
