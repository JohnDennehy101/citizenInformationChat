##  Standards and monitoring

All water that is for humans to consume must be free from micro-organisms and
any substances that would endanger public health. These standards are
contained in the [ European Union (Drinking Water) Regulations 2014
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2014/si/122/made/en/print) and the the EU
Drinking Water Directive of 1988 Irish law.

These laws create strict quality standards for water used for human
consumption and set out the level of different physical, bacteriological and
chemical contaminants allowed in water. Not all of these are monitored at the
same frequency.

The EPA has published detailed handbooks on the implementation of the
Regulations in [ private water supplies
](https://search.epa.ie/s/search.html?collection=epa-2021-search&query=private+water&f.Tabs%7Cepa-2021-publications=Publications)
and [ public water supplies
](http://www.epa.ie/pubs/advice/drinkingwater/publicwatersupplieshandbook/) .
