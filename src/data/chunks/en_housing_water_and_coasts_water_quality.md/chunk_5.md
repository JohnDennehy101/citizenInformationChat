###  Contaminated water

Infectious diseases caused by bacteria (like E Coli - also known as VTEC) and
parasites (like [ Cryptosporidium (pdf)
](http://www.hpsc.ie/A-Z/Gastroenteric/Cryptosporidiosis/Publications/File,14628,en.pdf)
) are the most significant health risks associated with contaminated drinking
water. These infectious diseases are very dangerous to children, older people,
pregnant women and people whose immune systems are compromised. If your water
changes in the colour, taste or smell it may be contaminated. However,
sometimes the water can be contaminated without these changes.
