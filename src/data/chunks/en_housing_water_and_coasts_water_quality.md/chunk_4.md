##  Other factors affecting water quality

Factors that can affect the quality of your drinking water sources (raw water)
include:

  * The type of soil 
  * The underlying ground 
  * Agricultural practices 
  * High rainfall (for example, extra organic material can wash into rivers and streams) 
  * Low rainfall can dry up water sources 

Factors that can affect treated drinking water (finished water) include:

  * Breakdown in the treatment process 
  * Lack of disinfection and filtration (or problems with them) 
  * Problems with equipment 
  * Power outages or dirt in distribution pipes 

Sometimes, poor quality water is caused by the water being drawn from an
unsuitable source and the best solution is finding an alternative source.
