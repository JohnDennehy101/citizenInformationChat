##  Enforcement of standards

The EPA is the supervisory authority for **public** water supplies and the
local authority is the supervisory authority for **private** supplies. This
means that they can legally enforce the standards set out in the Regulations
if agreed actions on a regulated water supply have not been taken within the
agreed timescale.

A notice (or Direction) can be served (by the EPA on Uisce Éireann or by the
local authority on private owners or trustees) to prepare a programme to
improve the water supply to the necessary standard as soon as possible.

Owners and trustees of private supplies must prepare their action programme in
consultation with the local authority.

If you are part of a group water scheme, it must fit in with the county’s
strategic rural water plan under the Rural Water Programme, outlined below.
Advice can be obtained from the [ National Federation of Group Water Schemes
](http://www.nfgws.ie/Home) .

The owners or trustees must submit the programme to the local authority within
2 months of receiving the notice. It should contain the following information:

  * A description of the quality issues to be dealt with 
  * Details of the changes put forward to bring the water supply up to drinking water standards 
  * Whether a capital grant under the Rural Water Scheme is needed 
  * A timeframe for the achievement of drinking water standards 
  * Details of the management or operational changes that may have been made to bring the scheme into compliance with drinking water standards. 

If the programme is not produced within 2 months, the person on whom the
notice was served is guilty of an offence under the Regulations. On summary
conviction in a District Court, they could be liable to a fine and/or a prison
sentence.
