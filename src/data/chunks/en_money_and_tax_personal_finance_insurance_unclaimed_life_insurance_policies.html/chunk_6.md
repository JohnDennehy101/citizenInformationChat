##  The Dormant Account Fund

Unclaimed life assurance policies must be transferred to the [ Dormant
Accounts Fund ](/en/money-and-tax/personal-finance/banking/dormant-bank-
accounts-in-ireland/) in April of each year. This fund is managed by the [
National Treasury Management Agency ](http://www.ntma.ie/) (NTMA).

The insurance companies must calculate the cash value of unclaimed life
insurance policies on the date that they are transferred to the Dormant
Accounts Fund.

The NTMA invests Dormant Accounts Fund and distributes its earnings to
programmes or projects helping people with disabilities and people who are
disadvantaged economically, socially, or educationally. This distribution is
organised by the [ Dormant Accounts Disbursement Fund
](https://www.gov.ie/en/collection/8f02c3-dormant-accounts-disbursement-
scheme/) .
