##  What are fair grounds for dismissal?

If you are dismissed from your job, it is automatically presumed to be an
_unfair dismissal_ , unless your employer can prove there are _fair grounds_
to justify it. Examples of fair grounds are redundancy or qualification
issues.

This means the employer must show evidence that the dismissal was fair and
that they followed _fair procedures_ before dismissing you.

This page explains fair grounds for dismissal, as well as the fair procedures
your employer must follow before you can be fairly dismissed.
