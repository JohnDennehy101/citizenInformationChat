###  Your competence to do the job

Competence refers to your ability to do your job. Firstly, your employer needs
to tell you about the standards that are expected of you, to do the job you
were hired for. This may be set out in your [ contract of employment
](/en/employment/employment-rights-and-conditions/contracts-of-
employment/contract-of-employment/) or employee handbook.

If you do not meet the required standard, your employer must clearly explain
this to you, using a formal procedure. Your employer should also tell you what
improvements you need to make. These improvements should be achievable, and
you must be given a reasonable timeframe to improve.

If problems with your competence continue, your employer should give you a
‘final warning’, setting out the likelihood of dismissal.
