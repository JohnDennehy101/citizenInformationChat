###  Your conduct (behaviour)

As a ground for fair dismissal, the term _conduct_ covers a very large area of
behaviour. Your employer needs to distinguish between:

  * Ordinary instances of misconduct 
  * Gross misconduct, which can lead to instant dismissal – read ‘What are grounds for instant dismissal’ below. 

_Ordinary instances of misconduct_ can be a series of minor incidents which,
when taken together, are enough to justify your dismissal. Your employer must
give you notice, or pay in lieu of notice.

Your employer needs to:

  * Investigate each situation to get all the facts of the case 
  * Give you appropriate warnings about your conduct 
  * Make you aware that, if the problems continue, you might be dismissed 

If your employer follows these steps, the dismissal is fair, because you have
been given a chance to improve your conduct.
