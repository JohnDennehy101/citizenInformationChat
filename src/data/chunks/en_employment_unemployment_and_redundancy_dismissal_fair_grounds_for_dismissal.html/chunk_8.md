###  Redundancy

Your employer needs to show that there is a genuine [ redundancy situation
](/en/employment/unemployment-and-redundancy/redundancy/what-is-redundancy/) ,
and that therefore, the dismissal is fair. If this is not the case, you will
need to show one (or more) of the following:

  * That there is no economic justification for the redundancy 
  * You have been replaced 
  * You were unfairly selected for redundancy
