##  Fair procedures

Your employer should have _disciplinary procedures_ in place, which must be
followed when considering dismissal.

Disciplinary procedures explain the process the employer should follow in
relation to the alleged shortcomings of an employee. Generally, the procedure
allows for informal warnings, which lead to written warnings, and ultimately
to dismissal.

Your employer must give you details about the disciplinary procedures, in
writing, **within 28 days** of your contract coming into effect.

Your employer must:

  * Follow fair procedures 
  * Give you appropriate warnings 
  * Make you fully aware of the allegations against you 
  * Give you an opportunity to present your side 
  * Allow you the right to be represented in any disciplinary procedures by, for example, your trade union official
