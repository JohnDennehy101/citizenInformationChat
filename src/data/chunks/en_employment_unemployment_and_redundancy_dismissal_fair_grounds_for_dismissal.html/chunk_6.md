###  Your qualifications for the job

Fair dismissal on grounds of qualifications can happen in 2 ways:

  1. You misled your employer about qualifications you had when applying for the job. 
  2. Your employer made your continued employment _conditional on_ (subject to) you getting further qualifications and you did not do this. You must have been given a reasonable opportunity to get the qualifications.
