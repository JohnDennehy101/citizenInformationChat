###  Long-term absences

In a case of a _long-term absence_ , your employer will need to get detailed
medical evidence that an early return to work is unlikely.

There is no ‘set period’ of absence to say a dismissal will, or will not, be
considered ‘reasonable’. However, the longer the absence, the easier it is for
your employer to show it is causing genuine difficulty for the business.

In terms of medical evidence, you may need to attend your employer's medical
expert. If there is a conflict of medical evidence between you and your
employer (in relation to the possible return-to-work date), your employer will
be expected to get a second opinion before dismissing you.

However, if your illness is considered a disability under [ employment
equality legislation ](http://www.ihrec.ie/publications/list/ihrec-employment-
equality-rights-explained/) , your rights under that particular legislation
need to be taken into consideration.
