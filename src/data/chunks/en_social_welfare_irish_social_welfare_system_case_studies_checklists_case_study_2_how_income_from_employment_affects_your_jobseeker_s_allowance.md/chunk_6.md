###  Note 1

Firstly, assess Frank's income from work using the following formula:

€20 per day from casual work (up to a maximum of €60) will be deducted from
his average assessable weekly earnings and then 60% of the balance will be
assessed as his weekly means.

€140 - €40 (2 days work) = €100 x 60% = €60

The following allowances are always deducted from your gross earnings to get
your assessable earnings:

  * PRSI contributions 
  * Union dues 
  * Superannuation 
  * PRSA (Personal Retirement Savings Account 
  * AVCs (Additional Voluntary Contributions) 

Frank's weekly means from employment of €60 is less than the maximum amount he
would be entitled to for his circumstances (€409.70). Because we now know he
is entitled to a certain amount of Jobseeker's Allowance the next step is to
calculate the actual amount of Jobseeker's Allowance he is entitled to. To do
this you must calculate his 'assessable daily earnings'.

He is entitled to JA only for periods of unemployment. The minimum period a
person must be unemployed in order to receive JA is 4 days in a period of 7
consecutive days. Frank has 5 consecutive days of unemployment. He is employed
for 2 days out of 7. (Sunday is counted as a day of work.)

Frank's average assessable daily earnings are €140

**Less** disregard for days worked €140 - €40 = €100 (No disregard for Sunday)

60 % of his assessable daily earnings of €100= €60

Frank's assessable income from employment is €60
