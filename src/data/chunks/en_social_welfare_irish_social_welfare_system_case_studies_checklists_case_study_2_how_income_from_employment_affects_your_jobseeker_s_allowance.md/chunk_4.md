###  Case study

Frank is living with his partner Joanne and their two children. He recently
lost his job and has applied for Jobseeker's Allowance. He has some temporary
work driving a minibus for a local disability service every Saturday and
Sunday. His assessable average weekly earnings are €140.

Joanne is working part-time for 3 days a week and earns €85 per week. She is
also getting Child Benefit for the two children aged under 12.

They recently sold their old family home and bought a newer house. They made a
profit of €15,000 on the sale of their house and have an additional €5,000
savings.
