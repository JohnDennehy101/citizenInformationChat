###  Note 2

Joanne's income from employment is €85.

€20 per day from casual work (up to a maximum of €60) will be deducted from
her average assessable weekly earnings and then 60% of the balance will be
assessed as her weekly means.

€85 - €60 (3 days worked) = €25 x 60% = €15

Child Benefit is not taken into account in the assessment of means.
