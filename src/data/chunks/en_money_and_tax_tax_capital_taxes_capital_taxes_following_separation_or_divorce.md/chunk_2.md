##  Introduction

When spouses or civil partners decide to separate and the separation is likely
to be permanent, it can affect the way they are taxed.

Here we explain the implications on capital taxes for separating married
couples or civil partners. You can also read about [ how income tax is
affected by separation or divorce ](/en/money-and-tax/tax/income-tax-credits-
and-reliefs/separation-divorce-and-tax-reliefs/) .

For cohabiting couples who are separating, read about [ Taxation of cohabiting
couples ](/en/money-and-tax/tax/income-tax/tax-and-cohabiting-couples/) .
