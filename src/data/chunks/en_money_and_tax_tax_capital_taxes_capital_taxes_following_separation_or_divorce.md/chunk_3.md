##  Capital Gains Tax

You dispose of an asset when you:

  * Sell it 
  * Give it as a gift 
  * Exchange it 
  * Get compensation or insurance for it 

If you dispose of an asset that has increased in value since you got it, the
increase is taxable under [ Capital Gains Tax (CGT)
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/money-and-tax/tax/capital-
taxes/capital-gains-tax/) .

Transfers of assets between spouses or civil partners are exempt from CGT.

Transfers of assets between spouses or civil partners who are separated are
also exempt from CGT if the transfer is made under a  deed of separation  or a
court order.

Transfers of assets between spouses or civil partners following a court order
in a [ decree of divorce ](/en/birth-family-relationships/separation-and-
divorce/divorce-decrees/) or [ decree of dissolution ](/en/birth-family-
relationships/separation-and-divorce/getting-a-dissolution/) are also exempt
from CGT. Transfers after the granting of a decree are not exempt if they are
not ordered by the court.

Separating couples should seek specialist tax advice before entering into
arrangements that have Capital Gains Tax implications.
