###  Who must I tell about the co-decision-making agreement?

After you make your co-decision-making agreement, you must tell:

  * Your spouse, civil partner or your partner 
  * Any children who are over 18 
  * Any decision supporters that were appointed under a different support arrangement (for example, a decision-making assistance agreement) 

The above people are known as notice parties.

After you have completed these steps, you can upload the documents and submit
your application.
