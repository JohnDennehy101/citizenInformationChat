##  Introduction

If you are not sure whether you can make certain decisions by yourself or
think you may soon be unable to do so, you can make a co-decision-making
agreement. This agreement allows you choose someone you know and trust as a
co-decision-maker to make certain decisions jointly with you.

These decisions could be about your personal care, property, or money matters.
For example your chosen person may jointly make decisions with you about your
home or assist you in making decisions about employment, training, or social
activities.

You can have more than one co-decision-making agreement. However, you can only
have one co-decision-maker for each agreement.

Co-decision-making agreements are one of the agreements that can be made under
the [ Assisted Decision Making (Capacity) Act ](/en/health/legal-matters-and-
health/assisted-decision-making-act/) .
