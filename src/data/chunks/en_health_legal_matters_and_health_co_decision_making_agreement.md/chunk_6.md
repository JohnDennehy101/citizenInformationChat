##  The role of the Decision Support Service

A co-decision-making agreement does not come into effect until it is
registered with the Decision Support Service.

Every year your co-decision-maker will have to send a written report to the
Decision Support Service. You must approve these reports, and they must
include details of:

  * Big decisions made together as part of the agreement 
  * The financial matters related to the agreement, including any costs or expenses claimed by the co-decision-maker 

The Decision Support Service can also send someone to talk to you, or your co-
decision-maker and ask them for a report. For example, the Decision Support
Service may send a general visitor or special visitor to talk to your co-
decision-maker if they have received a complaint or to make sure the agreement
is working the way that it should.
