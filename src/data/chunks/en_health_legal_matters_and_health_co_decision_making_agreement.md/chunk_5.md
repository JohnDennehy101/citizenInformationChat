##  Who can be a co-decision-maker?

Your co-decision-maker must be an adult (18 years and over) who you must know
and trust for a reasonable period of time.

The person cannot be a co-decision-maker if they:

  * Have been convicted of an offence against you or your child 
  * Are financially insolvent or have been convicted of an offence involving fraud or dishonesty (unless the agreement is about personal welfare decisions) 
  * Are the owner or a registered provider of a designated care or mental health facility where you live or the employee of such a person (unless they are your close relative) 
  * Were removed from the role of co-decision-maker for you 

A co-decision-making agreement may also end if:

  * The assistant is your spouse, civil partner and/or cohabitant and your relationship ends 
  * They become ineligible to be a co-decision-maker for one of the reasons above.
