###  Changing a co-decision-making agreement

You can change a co-decision-making agreement if it has been registered with
the Decision Support Service for more than 6 months, unless the Decision
Support Service agrees to a shorter period. You can generally only make
changes once in any 12-month period.

Both you and your co-decision maker must agree to changing the agreement.

You can make minor changes, by letting the Decision Support Service know of
the changes. If you are planning to make a major changes to the agreement,
this will go through most of the same steps as registering a new one.
