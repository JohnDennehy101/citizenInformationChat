##  Further information

A lawyer's fee must not be excessive for the work done. If you think your
lawyer's bill is excessive you should contact your solicitor to seek
clarification and try to come to an agreement.

You could also have your legal costs independently and impartially assessed by
the [ Office of Legal Costs Adjudicators ](/en/justice/courts-system/office-
of-the-legal-costs-adjudicators/) . This process is now known as the
adjudication of costs. It was previously known as the taxation of costs and
was carried out by Taxing Masters. The Courts Service has [ information on the
process ](https://www.courts.ie/general-information-legal-costs-adjudication)
on its website.

If you are still not happy you can make a complaint about excessive costs to
the [ Legal Services Regulatory Authority ](/en/justice/courts-system/legal-
services-regulatory-authority/) . The Legal Services Regulatory Authority is
independent in the performance of its functions. Read more about [ making a
complaint here ](https://www.lsra.ie/make-a-complaint/how-to-make-a-
complaint/) .
