##  Rules

The fee can consist of the professional fee, miscellaneous charges (for
example, phone calls) and charges from third parties, (for example, government
agencies).

Lawyer's charges are based on the following:

  * the complexity and novelty of the matter 
  * the skill or specialised knowledge needed to deal with the matter 
  * the time spent on the matter 
  * the urgency of the matter and whether priority was given to the matter over other matters 
  * circumstances in which the matter was dealt 
  * the number, importance and complexity of the documents prepared or examined 
  * the amount or value of any transaction involved 
  * whether there is any limitation on a lawyer’s liability 
  * the time reasonably spent researching the matter 
  * the reasonable costs of any expert witnesses used 

At the conclusion of the case, the solicitor and any barrister should give you
a detailed statement of all the legal costs associated with your case (“Bill
of Costs”). The Bill of Costs you receive, must contain certain things:

  * Summary of the legal services you were provided with 
  * Details of all the charges that were incurred and the nature of these charges 
  * The amount of VAT charged 
  * Where costs are calculated based on time, the amount of time spent on a matter 
  * The financial outcome of the case, i.e. any damages or other money recovered or payable to the client 
  * Whether any costs have been paid or are payable by another party 

The Bill of Costs must be accompanied by an explanation in writing of how any
aspect Bill of Costs can be challenged by a client.

Lawyers are generally not allowed to charge you on the basis of a percentage
of any award or settlement of your case.

If you are unhappy with your solicitor's or barrister’s bill you have a number
of options, see 'Further Information' below.

Usually if you win your case, most or all of your costs (including legal fees)
will be paid for by the other party.

However, you may be obliged to pay all the costs and fees of your own legal
team and that of the other party in the following situations:

  * if you lose your case 
  * agree to accept an amount less than your full claim 
  * a court fails to award you your costs or a proportion of them 
  * the court awards costs against you 

It is important to note that InjuriesBoard.ie doesn't award costs for or
against either party.
