###  Consumer protection organisations

Many of [ your rights as a consumer ](/en/consumer/consumer-laws/your-
consumer-rights/) in Ireland come from EU law. These rights are enforced by [
consumer protection bodies ](/en/consumer/how-to-complain/consumer-protection-
organisations/) in Ireland.

If you have a consumer complaint about a company that is based in another EU
country, you can contact the [ European Consumer Centre
](https://www.eccireland.ie/) .
