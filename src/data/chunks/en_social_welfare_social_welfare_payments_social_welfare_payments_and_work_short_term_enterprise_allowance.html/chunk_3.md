##  Rules

To qualify for the Short-Term Enterprise Allowance you must be getting, or
have an entitlement to, [ Jobseeker’s Benefit ](/en/social-welfare/unemployed-
people/jobseekers-benefit/) or [ Jobseeker's Benefit Self-Employed
](/en/social-welfare/unemployed-people/jobseekers-benefit-self-employed/) .

Your business plan must be approved in advance in writing by a Case Officer
based in an Intreo Centre or Social Welfare Branch Office - see 'How to apply'
below.

Seasonal, temporary or part time self-employment does not qualify for the
STEA.

You must contact the Department of Social Protection (DSP) immediately if your
self-employment ends or you take up employment.

If you are unemployed when your entitlement to STEA ends you will not
immediately re-qualify for JB or JBSE. However, you can apply for [
Jobseeker’s Allowance ](/en/social-welfare/unemployed-people/jobseekers-
allowance/) , which is a means-tested payment.
