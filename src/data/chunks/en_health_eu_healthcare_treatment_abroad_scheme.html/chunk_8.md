##  Costs covered by the Treatment Abroad Scheme

The amount that the HSE can cover can be different depending on the country
where you get treatment and the treatment that you need. You can ask the
hospital abroad how much you will need to pay.

You must provide confirmation of every appointment you are due to attend so
that the Health Service Executive (HSE) can approve your E112 form to cover
the cost of your visit. If you do not have the document at your appointment,
you may be charged and not be refunded by the HSE TAS office.

If you get additional healthcare treatments, associated examinations or
consultations, while you are abroad that have not been pre-approved by the HSE
TAS office, these will not be covered by the scheme.

If you donâ€™t bring your approved E112 form to your appointment abroad, you
might have to pay for your hospital visit. In this case, these costs will not
be refunded by HSE TAS office.

You may be able to get the Treatment Abroad Scheme to pay for some of the
fares for air or sea travel for you and a travelling companion. For more
