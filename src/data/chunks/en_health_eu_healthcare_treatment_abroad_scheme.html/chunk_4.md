##  How to apply for the Treatment Abroad Scheme

You, and your referring consultant, must complete an [ E112 application form
(pdf) ](https://assets.hse.ie/media/documents/treatment-abroad-scheme-
application-form-s2-e112-ie_12-22.pdf) .

You must send this to the HSE TAS office with a copy of your referral letter
from your consultant when applying.

You should apply early, as you will have to wait for the HSE to approve your
treatment abroad before you travel.

In the E112 form, your consultant must confirm that:

  * They are the consultant that is currently treating you. 
  * They assessed you within a 2-week period before making an application to the HSE. 
  * The application is based on their own medical opinion. A consultant cannot fill in a form at the request of another person. 

The E112 form will ask your consultant to confirm that the treatment abroad
is:

  * Medically necessary and will meet your needs 
  * Recognised by Irish law (unproven, experimental or test treatments are not covered) 
  * Available abroad in a public healthcare setting run by a registered medical practitioner 
  * Performed in a recognised hospital or other institution that accepts the E112 form
