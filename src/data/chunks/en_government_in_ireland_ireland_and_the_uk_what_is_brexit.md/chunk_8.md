##  The transition period

In January 2018, the European Council agreed negotiating directives for [
transitional arrangements ](http://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-
releases/2018/01/29/brexit-council-article-50-adopts-negotiating-directives-
on-the-transition-period/) after the UK leaves the EU. The period after UK
withdrawal was known as the transition period.

During the transition period, the UK was treated as if it was still a member
of the EU. The transition period ended on 31 December 2020.

This meant that during the transition period:

  * The UK remained part of the single market and customs union 
  * UK and EU citizens could [ move freely in each otherâ€™s territories ](/en/government-in-ireland/european-government/european-union/freedom-of-movement-in-the-eu/) and have the same rights as before 
  * The UK could make trade agreements with other countries but they could come into force until after the transition period 
  * The UK remained under the jurisdiction of [ Court of Justice of the European Union ](https://europa.eu/european-union/about-eu/institutions-bodies/court-justice_en)
  * The UK had no voting rights in EU institutions, including the [ European Parliament ](/en/government-in-ireland/european-government/eu-institutions/european-parliament/)
  * [ EU consumer law ](/en/consumer/consumer-laws/your-consumer-rights/) continued to apply to goods and services bought from the UK
