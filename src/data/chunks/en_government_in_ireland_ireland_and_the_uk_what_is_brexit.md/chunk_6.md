###  First withdrawal agreement

In November 2018, the European Commission and UK [ reached an agreement at
negotiator level ](http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_MEMO-18-6422_en.htm)
on a withdrawal agreement.

This document included a [ Protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland
](http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_MEMO-18-6423_en.htm) , setting out a
backstop arrangement to be used to avoid a hard border between Ireland and
Northern Ireland. This would see Northern Ireland keep full regulatory
alignment with the rules of the [ European Single Market
](https://ec.europa.eu/growth/single-market_en) and [ customs union
](https://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/facts-figures/eu-customs-union-unique-
world_en) .

An [ outline of the Political Declaration on the future EU UK relationship
](https://commission.europa.eu/publications/outline-political-declaration-
setting-out-framework-future-relationship-between-european-union-and_en) was
also agreed.

A withdrawal agreement can only come into effect if it is ratified by both the
EU and the UK. The first withdrawal agreement was not ratified by the UK.
