##  Negotiations on the UK’s withdrawal fromthe EU

Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union requires the EU to negotiate an
agreement with the member state that is withdrawing, setting out the
arrangements for withdrawal and taking account of the framework for the member
state’s future relationship with the EU. In April 2017, the European Council
adopted a [ set of political guidelines
](http://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2017/04/29/euco-
brexit-guidelines/) which defined the framework for the negotiations and set
out the EU's overall positions and principles. These guidelines stated that
the EU wishes to have the UK as a close partner after it withdraws from the
EU.

The UK was a member of the European Union throughout the negotiations and it
continued to be a member until the end of the Article 50 period. The European
Commission represented the EU27 as a whole in negotiating the UK’s withdrawal
agreement. There were no separate negotiations between individual EU member
states and the UK.

The Commission set up a [ Task Force for the Preparation and Conduct of the
Negotiations with the United Kingdom
](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_16_3016) .
