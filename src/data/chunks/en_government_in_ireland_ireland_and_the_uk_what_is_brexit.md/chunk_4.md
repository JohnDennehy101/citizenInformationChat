###  How Brexit negotiations progressed

The first phase of negotiations focused on the most immediate issues. The 3
priority issues were:

  * The rights of EU citizens in the UK and of UK citizens in the EU 
  * The framework for addressing the unique circumstances in Northern Ireland 
  * The financial settlement needed for the UK to honour past financial commitments 

In December 2017, the EU and UK agreed in principle how these 3 issues would
be progressed. This agreement included a commitment to avoiding a hard border
between Ireland and Northern Ireland. You can read the [ joint report

union-and-united-kingdom-government-progress-during-phase-1_en) from these
negotiations.

In February 2018, the European Commission published a [ draft withdrawal
agreement ](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/publications/draft-withdrawal-
agreement-withdrawal-united-kingdom-great-britain-and-northern-ireland-
european-union-and-european-atomic-energy-community_en) , which translated the
joint report from December 2017 into legal terms. This included protocols on
citizens' rights, transitional arrangements, Ireland and Northern Ireland and
institutional provisions, such as the Court of Justice of the European Union.

An [ amended version of the draft withdrawal agreement

atomic-energy-community-0_en) , showing areas of agreement and disagreement
using a colour-coding system, was published in March 2018.
