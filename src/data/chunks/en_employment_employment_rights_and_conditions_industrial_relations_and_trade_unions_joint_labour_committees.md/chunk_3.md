##  What does a Joint Labour Committee do?

Joint Labour Committees can draft up an [ Employment Regulation Order (ERO)
](/en/employment/employment-rights-and-conditions/industrial-relations-and-
trade-unions/employment-agreements-and-orders/) , setting out the employment
conditions and minimum rates of pay for the sector they represent. They send
the draft ERO to the Labour Court for review.

If the Labour Court agrees with the terms set out in the draft ERO, the ERO
will be sent to the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment. When the
Minister signs the ERO, it is given _statutory effect_ , which means it
becomes law.

There are currently 3 EROs in force, for the contract cleaning, security and
early learning and childcare sector.
