Your organisation must meet specific requirements to be considered a
charitable organisation. The Charities Regulator describes these requirements
as [ ‘the charity test’ ](https://www.charitiesregulator.ie/media/1544/what-
is-a-charity-rev-001.pdf) and your organisation must meet allthe criteria to
qualify. Your organisation must:

  * Exclusively promote this charitable purpose(s) 
  * Carry out all activities to further this charitable purpose(s) 
  * Exist to benefit the public or a section of the public in Ireland, or elsewhere, through its charitable purpose(s)
