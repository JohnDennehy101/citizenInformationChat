##  What is a charitable purpose?

Your organisation must have a charitable purpose to become a registered
charity. A ‘purpose’ is the reason your organisation was set up. It includes
what your organisation aims to achieve, how it will achieve these aims, who
will benefit and where the benefits extend. To be charitable, your
organisation’s purpose must be of public benefit.

Your purpose is usually set out in your organisation’s governing document. The
type of governing document your organisation has depends on how it is
structured, so if your organisation is:

  * A charitable trust - this document is the deed of trust that establishes the trust. 
  * A company - this document is the constitution (formerly known as the memorandum and articles of association). 
  * An unincorporated association - this document is a written set of rules.
