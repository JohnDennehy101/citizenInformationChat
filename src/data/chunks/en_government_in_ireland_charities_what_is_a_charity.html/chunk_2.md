##  Introduction

An organisation must meet specific criteria to be legally recognised as a
charity in Ireland. These criteria and a charityâ€™s legal obligations are set
out in the [ Charities Act 2009
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2009/act/6/enacted/en/html) .

Under the Act, a charitable organisation is defined as a body:

  * That exclusively promotes a charitable purpose (a charitable purpose is a goal that is of public benefit) 
  * That states in its constitution or governing documents that it must use all of its property to further its charitable purpose (except for money used in its operation and maintenance, for example, staff wages) 
  * Does not use its property to pay or provide benefits in kind to its members, except in specific circumstances 

A charity must be set up in one of 3 ways. The people who control and are
legally responsible for its management are its trustees. [ Read more about the

The [ Charities Regulatory Authority
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/government_in_ireland/national_government/standards_and_accountability/charities_regulatory_authority.en.html)
(Charities Regulator) is an independent statutory body that regulates
charities in Ireland. It maintains a public register of charities active in
Ireland and monitors their compliance with the Charities Act 2009.

In November 2018 the Charities Regulator published a new [ Charities
Governance Code ](https://www.charitiesregulator.ie/en/information-for-the-
public/our-news/2018/november/charities-governance-code-launched) , which sets
out minimum standards for the governance of charities. Charities should be
ready to comply with the Code and report on their compliance in 2021.
