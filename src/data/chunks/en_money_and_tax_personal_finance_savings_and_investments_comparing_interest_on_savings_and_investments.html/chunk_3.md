##  Interest on loans and overdrafts – APR

The Annual Percentage Rate (APR) is a calculation of the overall cost of your
loan. It is an annual rate that represents the actual yearly cost of the funds
borrowed. It takes into account all the costs during the term of the loan
including any set up charges and the interest rate. This means that fees and
charges are added to the loan amount before interest is calculated.

APR is calculated each year on the reducing amount of the loan you still owe
as you pay it back. The higher the APR the more it will cost you to borrow.

All lenders must quote the interest rate on a loan or credit card as an APR.
This requirement is in [ Section 21 of the Consumer Credit Act 1995
](https://revisedacts.lawreform.ie/eli/1995/act/24/section/21/revised/en/html)
.

You can use the APR to compare loans once they are for the same amount and the
same term. For example, a loan with an APR of 15% is more expensive than one
with an APR of 11%. You cannot use APR to compare loans of different terms –
if the terms are different you should look at the cost of credit. The cost of
credit is the real cost of borrowing. It is the difference between the amount
you borrow and the total you repay.

The CCPC has a [ loan comparison ](https://www.ccpc.ie/consumers/money-
tools/loan-comparison/) tool that shows you the total cost and monthly
repayments for personal loans that are available.
