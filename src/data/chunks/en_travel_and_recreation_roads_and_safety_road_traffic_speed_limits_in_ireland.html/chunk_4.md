###  Safety cameras

An Garda Síochána has contracted the GoSafe consortium to operate safety
cameras on their behalf. The safety cameras, operated by GoSafe staff have
been on roads with a history of collisions occurring where speed was a
contributory factor. The cameras operate from vans which are marked with high
visibility reflective material and display a safety camera symbol.

Average speed detection is also used in Ireland. On certain roads in Ireland,
the average speed you travel can be detected by average speed cameras. These
cameras measure your average speed while driving between 2 points, unlike
traditional speed cameras that only check your speed at one specific point
along a road. The average speed camera tracks how long it takes you to travel
between 2 points and uses this information to calculate your average speed.

There are average speed cameras on the M7 motorway and the Dublin Port Tunnel.
By the end of 2024, other locations are expected to have them. More
information is available on [ garda.ie ](https://www.garda.ie/en/roads-
