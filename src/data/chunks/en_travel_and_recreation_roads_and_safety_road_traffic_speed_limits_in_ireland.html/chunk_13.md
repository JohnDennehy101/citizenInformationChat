##  Fines and penalties

If you drive over the speed limit, you will get 3 penalty points and a fixed
charge fine of €160. If you do not pay the fine within 28 days, it increases
to €240. If you do not pay this within 28 days (56 days from the original fine
notification date), you will be summonsed to court where, if convicted, you
could be fined up to €1000 and receive up to 5 penalty points.

If you were not the driver of the vehicle, you must complete the relevant
section on the notice and return it within 28 days of its issue.

Further information on fixed-charge notices is available in our [ page on
driving offences ](/en/travel-and-recreation/motoring/driving-
offences/driving-offences/) .
