###  **If you are involved in an industrial dispute**

If you are refused [ Jobseeker's Benefit ](/en/social-welfare/unemployed-
people/jobseekers-benefit/) or [ Jobseeker's Allowance ](/en/social-
welfare/unemployed-people/jobseekers-allowance/) because of an industrial
dispute at your place of employment, you can contact The Social Welfare
Tribunal.

[ The Social Welfare Tribunal ](https://www.gov.ie/en/organisation-
information/72c24-how-the-social-welfare-tribunal-works/) provides a second
level of appeal after an appeal to the Social Welfare Appeals Office. However,
you can also appeal directly to the Tribunal without first going through the
Social Welfare Appeals Office.
