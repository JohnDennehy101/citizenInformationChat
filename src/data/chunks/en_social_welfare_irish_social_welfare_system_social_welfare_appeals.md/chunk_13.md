####  **A decision is made**

In some cases, new evidence is reviewed by a social welfare inspector, or by a
medical assessor if the appeal is about a sickness or disability-related
payment.

If the decision is changed by the Department at this stage, you will be
informed. The Department can only change the decision at this stage if the
change is in your favour.

If the decision is not changed by the Department, your case will be examined
by an Appeals Officer.

The Appeals Officer may decide your appeal based on written evidence. This is
called deciding the appeal _summarily_ .

Generally, the decision of an Appeals Officer is final. However, an Appeals
Officer may revise their decision if new evidence, new facts or any relevant
change of circumstances come to light after a decision is made.
