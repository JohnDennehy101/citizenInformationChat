##  Powers of tribunals of inquiry

To carry out the investigation, the tribunal has certain powers, including the
power to hold public or private hearings. The Oireachtas may decide that any
tribunal that it sets up shall be invested with the powers set out in the
Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Acts 1921 to 2011.

This Act provides that a tribunal can make orders to force witnesses to attend
and give evidence. It also allows the tribunal to apply to the [ High Court
](/en/justice/courts-system/high-court/) if a person refuses to give evidence
or is in contempt of the tribunal.

The High Court may order a witness to give evidence. If he or she continues to
fail to co-operate with the tribunal, the High Court may hold the witness in
contempt of court and have the witness imprisoned until he or she has co-
operated with the tribunal. It is also a criminal offence to refuse to give
evidence or to co-operate with a tribunal.

Any statement or admission made at a tribunal cannot be used in evidence
against a person in criminal proceedings. However, sometimes the findings of
tribunals can give rise to an investigation leading to independent criminal or
civil proceedings.

This means that strict procedures are applied in the course of the tribunals.
Interested parties usually have legal representation, including a solicitor,
and both junior and senior counsel barristers. Witnesses are usually cross-
examined.
