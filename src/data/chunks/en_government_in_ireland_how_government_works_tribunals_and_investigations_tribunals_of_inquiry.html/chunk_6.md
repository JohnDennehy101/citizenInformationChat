##  Recommendations and findings

At the end of the tribunal's investigation, it will submit a report to the
Oireachtas setting out the findings it has made. In many cases, a tribunal of
inquiry will also be given the power to make recommendations with a view to
preventing the same problem happening again. These recommendations may include
suggestions for law reform.

The tribunal's function is purely fact-finding and investigative. Although it
may make recommendations, it does not make a binding judgement on the rights
or liabilities of individuals. It simply states, in its report, the results of
its investigations and the findings of fact it has made.
