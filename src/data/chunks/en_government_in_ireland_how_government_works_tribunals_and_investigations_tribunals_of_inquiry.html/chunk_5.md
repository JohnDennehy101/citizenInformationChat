##  Costs of tribunals of inquiry

The cost of tribunals of inquiry, including the cost of legal representation
of all interested parties, is usually paid by the State. If the tribunal
considers that there is sufficient reason to do so, it can order any person to
pay the costs of another person appearing before the tribunal or the costs of
the tribunal itself. This may happen if a person fails to co-operate with the
tribunal or gives false or misleading evidence.
