##  Introduction

The [ Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015
](https://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2015/act/64/enacted/en/html) is a law
that establishes a new legal framework for [ supported decision-making
](/en/health/legal-matters-and-health/decision-support-arrangements/) in
Ireland. It allows people to make legal agreements on how they can be
supported to make decisions about their personal welfare, property and
affairs.

These new regulations may help you, if you donâ€™t have the capacity to make
decisions, now or in the future, without help.

People who may have difficulty making decisions include (for example) people
with intellectual disabilities, acquired brain injury, mental health
difficulty or dementia.

The Act also allows you to plan for a time when you might lose your capacity
in 2 types of future planning arrangements, known as [ Advance healthcare
directives ](/en/health/legal-matters-and-health/advance-care-directives/) and
[ Enduring power of attorney ](/en/death/before-a-death/power-of-attorney/) .

Decision support arrangements only apply to people aged over 18.

The Act came into effect on 26 April 2023.
