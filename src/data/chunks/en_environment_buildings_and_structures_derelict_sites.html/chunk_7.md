###  Compulsory purchase

The local authority can buy a derelict site in its area, either by agreement
with the owner or by compulsory purchase. It must advertise the details of any
proposed compulsory purchase in the local newspaper and send a notice to the
owner or occupier of the land, giving information about how and where to
object to the purchase. If an objection is made, the local authority cannot
buy the land without the consent of [ An Bord Pleanála ](/en/housing/planning-
permission/an-bord-pleanala/) .

If An Bord Pleanála approves the compulsory purchase and the local authority
has dealt with any objections received, the local authority can buy the land,
using a vesting order.
