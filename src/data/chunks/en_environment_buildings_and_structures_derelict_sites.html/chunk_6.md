###  Statutory notices

If you are the owner or occupier of a derelict site, you are likely to receive
several statutory notices from your local authority.

  * The first is a notice informing you that your property has been added to the Derelict Sites Register. 
  * You will then get another notice to tell you what the local authority wants you to do to clean up your site. 

In some circumstances, a local authority may decide to carry out a compulsory
purchase of a derelict site.

You have the right to respond to any notice that the local authority sends you
and to make an objection to the compulsory purchase of a site.
