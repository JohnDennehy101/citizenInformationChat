##  If you are not happy with the service

If things go wrong with the service, it is always the trader who should put
things right.

Under consumer law, the trader must resolve any issue, so the service meets
what was agreed in the contract.

The seller must correct the issue for free, within a _reasonable_ time and
without significant inconvenience to you. A reasonable time means the shortest
possible time to fix the issue.
