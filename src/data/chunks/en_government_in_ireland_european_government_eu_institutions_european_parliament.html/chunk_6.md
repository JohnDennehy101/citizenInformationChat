##  How do I raise a concern with the European Parliament?

If you have an issue that you wish to bring to the attention of the
Parliament, you can either contact your local MEP, or petition the Parliament
directly.

You can also contact the liaison office in Ireland. See ‘further information
and contacts’ below.
