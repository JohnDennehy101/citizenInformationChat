###  Residency

Successful applicants for the **Start-up Entrepreneur Programme** and their
immediate families will be granted residence permission for 2 years initially.
Their immediate family means their spouse, civil partner or partner and
dependent children aged under 18. In certain cases, children between the ages
of 18 and 24 will be considered for residence under the programme. This
permission can be renewed for a further 3 years. After these first 5 years,
the investor or entrepreneur can apply for long-term residence. If required
they will be granted multiple entry visas for the same duration.
