##  Introduction

If you are an [ EEA or Swiss national ](/en/moving-country/moving-to-
ireland/rights-of-residence-in-ireland/residence-rights-eu-national/) you are
entitled to come and work in Ireland either as an employed or a self-employed
person. EEA and Swiss nationals do not need permission to establish a business
in Ireland and they do not require a visa to visit, travel to, live or work in
Ireland.

UK citizens have the right to work within Ireland, including on a self-
employed basis. Find out more in our document on the [ Common Travel Area
between Ireland and the United Kingdom ](/en/government-in-ireland/ireland-
and-the-uk/common-travel-area-between-ireland-and-the-uk/) . You can read more
about ‘ [ Residence rights of UK citizens ](/en/government-in-ireland/ireland-
and-the-uk/residence-rules-UK-citizens/) ’.

If you are coming from outside Ireland to set up a business you will need
information on a number of topics such as tax and legal requirements – see
‘Information and supports’ below.
