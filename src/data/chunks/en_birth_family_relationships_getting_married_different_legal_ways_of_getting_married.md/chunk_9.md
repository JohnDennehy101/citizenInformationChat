##  Registered solemnisers

A solemniser is the term given to a person licensed by the State to conduct
weddings. Only a registered solemniser can perform a legally binding wedding
ceremony. The [ General Register Office
](https://www.gov.ie/en/campaigns/af7893-general-register-office/) maintains a
[ Register of Solemnisers of Marriage (pdf)
](https://www.welfare.ie/en/downloads/RegisterOfSolemnisers.pdf) and anyone
solemnising a civil, secular or religious marriage must be on the Register.
These categories are clearly outlined in the Register of Solemnisers as
civil/religious/secular.
