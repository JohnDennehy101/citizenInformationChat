##  Introduction

In Ireland, there are 3 different ways to legally marry. A marriage may be
celebrated in a civil ceremony, a religious ceremony or in a secular ceremony
and each is equally valid and binding under Irish law. For a marriage to be
legal, the ceremony must be performed by a registered solemniser (see
'Registered solemnisers' below).

To have a legally valid marriage in Ireland, both parties must:

  * Have the [ capacity to marry ](/en/birth-family-relationships/getting-married/legal-requirements-for-marriage/)
  * Freely consent to the marriage, and 
  * Meet the [ notification requirements for marriage ](/en/birth-family-relationships/getting-married/notification-requirements-for-marriage/) . 

Once you have fulfilled these conditions, you should consider how you wish to
marry.
