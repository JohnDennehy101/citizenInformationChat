###  Civil ceremony

Civil ceremonies are legally binding secular marriage ceremonies performed by
a registrar. The registrar works for the State.

Civil ceremonies can take place in a registry office, or registrars can travel
to perform civil ceremonies in an approved room or venue. In general,
registrars only perform ceremonies in the county in which they are based.

Civil ceremonies can only take place within the office working hours of the
registrar.

There can be no mention of anything religious or spiritual in your ceremony.
If you are planning to get married by civil ceremony, you should contact the [
civil registration service ](https://www2.hse.ie/services/births-deaths-and-
marriages/contact-a-civil-registration-service.html) in the district in which
you intend to marry for advice on how to proceed. There is no requirement to
live in the district where you want to get married.
