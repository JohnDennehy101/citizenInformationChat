##  Renewing your wedding vows

In Ireland, someone who is already married cannot get married again (even if
it is to the same person). This means that you cannot renew your wedding vows
in a civil ceremony in Ireland.

However, there is a long tradition of "church blessings" in Ireland. This is
where Irish people who have married in civil ceremonies abroad, marry in a
religious ceremony the next time they are home. Sometimes, people living in
Ireland have their marriage blessed in a religious ceremony, to commemorate a
special anniversary or event. If you would like to have your marriage blessed,
you should get in touch with your local member of the clergy.
