##  The Council of the European Union

The Council of the European Union shares decision-making power with the
European Parliament, particularly in the areas of law-making and budget
approval.

The Council consists of the government minister of each state who is
responsible for whichever topic the Council is discussing. For example, if
agriculture is being discussed, the Council will be made up of the ministers
with responsibility for agriculture of each member state (the council of
ministers).

The presidency of the Council rotates every 6 months.
