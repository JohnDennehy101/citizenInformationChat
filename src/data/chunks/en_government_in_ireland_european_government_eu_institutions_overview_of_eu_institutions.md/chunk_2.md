##  Introduction

[ The European Union ](/en/government-in-ireland/european-government/european-
union/european-union/) has 7 main decision-making institutions. Each
institution has functions that have been set out in the Treaty on European
Union.

The legislative, or law making, function of the EU is carried out by 3
institutions:

  * [ The Council of the European Union ](/en/government-in-ireland/european-government/eu-institutions/council-of-the-european-union/)
  * [ The European Commission ](/en/government-in-ireland/european-government/eu-institutions/european-commission/)

The overall policy direction and priorities of the EU is decided by:

  * [ The European Council ](/en/government-in-ireland/european-government/eu-institutions/european-council/)

The judicial wing of the EU, responsible for settling disputes and enforcing
EU law is:

  * [ The Court of Justice of the European Union ](/en/government-in-ireland/european-government/eu-institutions/european-court-of-justice/)

The [ Court of Auditors ](/en/government-in-ireland/european-government/eu-
institutions/court-of-auditors/) oversees budgets and represents the interests
of EU taxpayers, while the [ European Central Bank
](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/home/html/index.en.html) manages the euro and
