##  The European Council

The European Council is a separate institution to the Council of the European
Union.

The European Council consists of the heads of government of each EU member
state, the European Council President ( [ currently Charles Michel
](https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/european-council/president/) ) and the
President of the European Commission (Ursula von der Leyen).

The Council meets at least twice every 6 months in Brussels. It does not have
the power to initiate or pass laws. Instead, it decides on strategies and
policies.

The European Council appoints the president, vice-president and executive
members of the European Central Bank.
