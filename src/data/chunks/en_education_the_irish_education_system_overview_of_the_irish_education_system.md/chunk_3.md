##  Pre-school education

The [ Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) Scheme ](/en/education/pre-
school-education-and-childcare/early-childhood-care-and-education-scheme/)
provides free early childhood care and education for children of pre-school
age.

Other than the ECCE, [ pre-school education
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/education/pre_school_education_and_childcare/)
is usually provided by privately funded childcare services. However, the [
National Childcare Scheme (NCS) ](/en/education/pre-school-education-and-
childcare/national-childcare-scheme/) provides financial support to help
parents to meet the costs of private childcare.

The Department of Education also funds some [ pre-school initiatives focused
on children at risk ](/en/education/primary-and-post-primary-
education/attendance-and-discipline-in-schools/home-school-liaison/) .
