##  Third-level education

[ Third-level education ](/en/education/third-level-education/) is made up of
a number of sectors that are substantially funded by the State.

  * University sector 
  * Technological sector 
  * Colleges of education 

Universities in general are autonomous and self-governing. They offer degree
programmes at bachelor, masters and doctorate level.

The technological sector includes [ technological universities (TUs)
](https://www.gov.ie/en/press-release/69b0f-minister-harris-officially-opens-
new-atlantic-technological-university/) and institutes of technology (ITs)
which provide programmes of education and training in areas such as business,
science, engineering, linguistics and music to certificate, diploma and degree
levels.

The [ colleges of education ](http://www.teachingcouncil.ie/teacher-
education/initial-teacher-education-ite.191.html) specialise in training for
primary school teachers. Training for post-primary teachers is provided by
many third-level institutions. Qualifax provides detailed information on [
programmes for teacher training

.

In December 2022, the Government announced plans to develop joint further and
higher education degree programmes. From September 2023, students may start
some degree programmes in further education and progress to higher education.
