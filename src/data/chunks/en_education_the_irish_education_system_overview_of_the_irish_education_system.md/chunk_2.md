##  Education in Ireland

The Irish education system is made up of [ primary school
](/en/education/primary-and-post-primary-education/going-to-primary-
school/starting-primary-school/) and [ post-primary school
](/en/education/primary-and-post-primary-education/going-to-post-primary-
school/starting-post-primary-school/) (also know as secondary school). You
must ensure that your child gets a [ certain minimum education from the age of
6 to 16 ](/en/education/primary-and-post-primary-education/attendance-and-
discipline-in-schools/school-attendance/) or until they have completed 3 years
of post-primary education.

Primary and post-primary schools must provide places based on their [ school
admissions policy and admissions notice ](/en/education/the-irish-education-
system/admissions-policies-in-primary-and-secondary-schools/) .

Many people continue on after post-primary to [ further education
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/education/vocational_education_and_training/)
and [ third-level education
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/education/third_level_education/) .
State-funded education is available at all levels, unless you choose to send
your child to a private school.
