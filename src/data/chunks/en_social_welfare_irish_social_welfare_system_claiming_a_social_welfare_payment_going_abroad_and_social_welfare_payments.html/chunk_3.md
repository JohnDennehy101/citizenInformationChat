###  UK and social insurance payments

On [ 31 January 2020, the UK exited the EU
](https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2020/01/30/brexit-
council-adopts-decision-to-conclude-the-withdrawal-agreement/) . The [
Convention on Social Security between Ireland and the United Kingdom (pdf)
](http://opac.oireachtas.ie/AWData/Library3/EASPdoclaid07022019_095636.pdf)
maintains the recognition of, and access to, social insurance entitlements in
both jurisdictions. This means that the rights of Irish citizens living in
Ireland to benefit from social insurance contributions made when working in
the UK are protected and vice versa.

You can find a list of [ Irish social welfare payments covered by the
Convention ](https://www.gov.ie/en/press-release/c1896-social-protection-
