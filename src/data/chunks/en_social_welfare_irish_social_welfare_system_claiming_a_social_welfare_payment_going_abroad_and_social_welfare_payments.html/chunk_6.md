###  Irish social welfare payments paid outside the State

If you are living outside the Irish State, the following social welfare
payments can be paid abroad:

  * [ Invalidity Pension ](/en/social-welfare/disability-and-illness/invalidity-pension/)
  * [ State Pension (Contributory) ](/en/social-welfare/older-and-retired-people/state-pension-contributory/)
  * [ Disablement Benefit ](/en/social-welfare/disability-and-illness/disablement-benefit/) . The Constant Attendance Allowance increase is only paid for up to 6 months. However, if you are abroad for medical treatment you may continue to get Incapacity Supplement, such claims are assessed on a case by case basis. 
  * [ Guardian's Payment (Contributory) ](/en/social-welfare/death-related-benefits/guardian-and-orphan-payments/)
  * [ Widow's, Widower's or Surviving Civil Partner's (Contributory) Pension ](/en/social-welfare/death-related-benefits/widowed-persons-contrib-pension/)
  * [ Death Benefits under the Occupational Injury Benefit Scheme ](/en/social-welfare/death-related-benefits/death-benefits-under-oib/)

Increases may also continue to be paid where it is the qualified [ adult or
child who is absent from the State
](https://www.gov.ie/ga/foilsiuchan/66826a-operational-guidelines-absence-
from-the-state/) . The normal conditions of dependency must continue to be
fulfilled.

If you are getting one of these social welfare payments and you are going
abroad for just a few weeks, you do _not_ have to notify the Department of
Social Protection.

If you are going abroad for a long period of time or moving abroad permanently
you must notify the Department. You will be asked to produce evidence to prove
that you continue to fulfil the qualifying conditions for the payment. For
example, you must not be married or in a new civil partnership or cohabitating
with someone to continue to get a Widow's, Widower's or Surviving Civil
Partner's Contributory Pension.

To get your social welfare benefit paid to you abroad, you must contact the
section in the Department of Social Protection that pays your payment and give
your bank account details so that they can transfer your payment directly into
a bank account while you are abroad. Where payment is already made into your
bank account in the State, you can continue to have it paid as it is or change
it to a financial institution outside the country.

You must always notify the Department of a permanent or temporary absence from
the State and give your contact address abroad.
