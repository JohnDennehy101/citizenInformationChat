##  Getting married abroad

If you are an Irish citizen and are planning to marry abroad, the legal
validity of your marriage is governed, in part, by the laws of the country in
which you marry. The legal formalities abroad can be very different to those
in Ireland. You can read information for [ Irish citizens planning to marry
