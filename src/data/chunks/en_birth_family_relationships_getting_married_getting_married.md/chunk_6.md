##  Different ways of getting married

There are different [ legal ways of getting married in Ireland ](/en/birth-
family-relationships/getting-married/different-legal-ways-of-getting-married/)
. These include [ civil marriage ceremonies ](/en/birth-family-
relationships/getting-married/civil-marriage-ceremony/) and [ religious and
secular marriage ceremonies ](/en/birth-family-relationships/getting-
married/religious-and-secular-marriage-ceremonies/) . The requirements of
different faiths and secular bodies may differ, so check in advance with the
relevant member of the clergy or body for further information.

Since November 2007, no matter how you marry (that is, through a civil,
secular or religious ceremony), the registration process is the same. You are
issued with a Marriage Registration Form (MRF) by the registrar, following
notification, which gives you authorisation to get married. You give it to the
person who will be solemnising (performing) your marriage. Following the
marriage ceremony, the completed MRF should be given to a registrar within one
month of the marriage ceremony, for [ the marriage to be registered
](/en/birth-family-relationships/getting-married/registration-of-marriage/) .
Some [ civil registration services ](https://www2.hse.ie/services/births-
deaths-and-marriages/contact-a-civil-registration-service.html) have a walk-in
service. You need to phone and book an appointment for others. You cannot get
your marriage certificate until the marriage is registered.
