##  Notification requirements for marriage

If you are getting married in Ireland (whether you are an Irish citizen or a
foreign national), you must notify the registrar in the [ Civil Registration
Office ](https://www2.hse.ie/services/births-deaths-and-marriages/contact-a-
civil-registration-service.html) of your intention to marry at least 3 months
before your wedding day. You should book your appointment to give notice as
far in advance as possible as appointments fill up quickly.

Both of you must attend the marriage notification appointment.

When you meet the registrar, you will sign a declaration stating that you do
not know of [ any legal reason why the marriage cannot happen
](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/a4a0c2-impediments-to-marriage-in-
ireland/) . If everything is in order, the registrar gives you a marriage
registration form (MRF). The MRF gives you authorisation or permission to get
married. You give it to the person who will be solemnising (the person who is
authorised to perform) your marriage.

Find out [ how to notify the Registrar ](/en/birth-family-
relationships/getting-married/notification-requirements-for-marriage/) that
you will be getting married in Ireland.

The requirement to give 3-months' notice does not apply to civil partners
whose civil partnership was registered in Ireland. If civil partners choose to
marry, their civil partnership is automatically dissolved. Contact your local
[ Civil Registration Office ](https://www2.hse.ie/services/births-deaths-and-
marriages/contact-a-civil-registration-service.html) to check what
documentation you need to provide.
