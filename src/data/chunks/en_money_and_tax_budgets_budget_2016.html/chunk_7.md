####  Employee PRSI

A new **weekly tapered PRSI credit of €12** is being introduced for employees
insured at Class A whose earnings are between €352.01 and €424 in a week. A
similar PRSI credit will apply to Class E and Class H employees with weekly
earnings between €352.01 and €422 or €424, respectively.

The maximum PRSI credit of €12 per week applies to gross weekly earnings of
€352.01. A person earning €352.01 pays €14.08 PRSI (4%). After the €12 credit
is deducted they will pay PRSI of €2.08.

For people earning between €352.01 and €424, the credit of €12 is reduced by
one-sixth of earnings over €352.01. For example, a person earning €377 would
get a PRSI credit of €7.83 – this is one-sixth of the difference between €377
and €352.01 subtracted from the maximum credit of €12. There is no PRSI credit
once earnings exceed €424 (January 2016). This provision will reduce the
weekly PRSI bill for over 88,000 employees.
