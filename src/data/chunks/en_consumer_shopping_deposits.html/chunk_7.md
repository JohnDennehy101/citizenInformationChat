If you pay a deposit and the [ seller goes out of business
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/consumer/buying-services/company-gone-
out-of-business/) before your goods or service is delivered, it may be
difficult for you to get your money back or to get the item or service.

Usually, the seller will owe money to several people so your claim is just one
of many. There are rules for the priority to be given to debts when a business
goes into liquidation or receivership. Generally, you will be low in the order
of priority.

If you paid the deposit using a credit card or debit card, you can contact
your bank or credit card provider to request a [ chargeback
