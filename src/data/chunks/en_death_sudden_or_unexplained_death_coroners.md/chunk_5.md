been to see their doctor about within one month before their death.

death [ can then be registered ](/en/death/practical-arrangements-after-a-
death/registering-a-death/) and a [ death certificate
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/death/practical-arrangements-after-a-
death/registering-a-death/#eaa472) can be obtained.
