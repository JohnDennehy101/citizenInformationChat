##  Coroner's role and responsibilities

A coroner investigates the circumstances of sudden, unexplained and violent
deaths. A coroner will first establish whether or not the death was due to
natural causes. This may require a [ post-mortem examination
](/en/death/sudden-or-unexplained-death/postmortems/) , sometimes followed by
an [ inquest ](/en/death/sudden-or-unexplained-death/inquests-and-inquest-
reports/) .

If a post-mortem is required, this will be done by a pathologist on behalf of
the coroner. If the death is due to unnatural causes, a coroner can decide to
hold an inquest.

The coroner essentially establishes the "who, when, where and how" of
unexplained death. A coroner is not allowed to consider civil or criminal
liability â€“ they must simply establish [ the facts
