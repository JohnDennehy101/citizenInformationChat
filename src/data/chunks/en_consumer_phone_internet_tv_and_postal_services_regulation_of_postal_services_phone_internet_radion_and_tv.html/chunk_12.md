##  How to complain

If things do go wrong, you should check the service provider’s Code of
Practice for complaint handling. This should be available on the service
provider’s website. If you can’t find it you have a right to ask for a copy.
You should then contact the service provider to explain your problem how you
want it fixed.

If you are not happy with the response , you can contact ComReg’s Consumer
Care team for more advice. Find out more about [ how to complain about phone,
