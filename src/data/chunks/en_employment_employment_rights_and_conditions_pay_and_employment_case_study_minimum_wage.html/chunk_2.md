###  **Answer**

No, Sean's employer is incorrect. The €20 premium for working on Saturdays
should not be included for national minimum wage purposes. This means that
only €480 should be divided by 39, giving an average hourly pay of €12.30 -
below the national minimum wage of €12.70.

Sean's entitlement is a basic wage of €495.30 (€12.70 x 39) plus €20 Saturday
premium which comes to a total of €515.30.
