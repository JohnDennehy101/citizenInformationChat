###  **Interviewing a child without an adult present**

If the Gardaí propose to question a child in the absence of a parent or
guardian, they must try and arrange for another parent, relative or other
responsible person to be present during the interview.

If you are over 18, the [ Garda Síochána

siochana-national-police-force/) are entitled to interview you if you have
been arrested, charged and cautioned in Ireland. Read more about [ Garda
