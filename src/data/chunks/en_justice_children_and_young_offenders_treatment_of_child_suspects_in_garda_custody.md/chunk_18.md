###  **If a parent, guardian or adult is not present**

Where the child’s parents or guardian are not present in the Garda station
when the child is being charged, the Garda in charge must make sure that they
get the following information as soon as possible:

  * A copy of the charge sheet 
  * Details of the time, date and place of the child’s first court appearance 

They must also be informed of both the names of:

  * Any adult who attended the Garda station at the request of the child 
  * Any solicitor and their address who may have visited the child while in custody in the Garda station.
