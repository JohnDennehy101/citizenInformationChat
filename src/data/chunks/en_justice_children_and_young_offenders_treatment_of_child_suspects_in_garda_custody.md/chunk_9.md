###  Notifying the child’s solicitor

When a child who is detained has asked for a [ solicitor
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/justice/courtroom/solicitors/) , the
Garda in charge must notify that solicitor as soon as possible.

If the solicitor cannot be contacted or is unwilling or unable to attend, the
child must be told and allowed to ask for another solicitor. This solicitor
must then be notified by the Gardaí.

If the child requests a solicitor but doesn’t know one or doesn’t name one
specifically, then the Garda in charge gives the child the name of a number of
solicitors who are willing to attend the Garda station.

The parents or guardian or other relative are all also entitled to ask for a
solicitor on behalf of the child.
