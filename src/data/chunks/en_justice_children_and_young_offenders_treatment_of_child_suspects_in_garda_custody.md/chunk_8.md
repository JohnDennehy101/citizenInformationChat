###  **Contacting another adult relative**

If the parents or guardian cannot be contacted, or if they simply refuse to
attend the Garda station, then the child must be informed that they can
nominate another adult relative or other adult to be informed. Any such person
(parent, guardian or other nominated person) will be asked to attend the Garda
station without delay.

**Tusla representative**

If the Garda in charge believes the child may be in need of care or
protection, they must also request the Child and Family Agency (Tusla) to send
a representative to the station as soon as possible.
