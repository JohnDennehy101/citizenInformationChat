##  Treatment of suspects aged under 18

At all times during the investigation of an offence where a child is a
suspect, the child should be treated with dignity appropriate to their age and
capacity by Gardaí.

However, Gardaí are allowed to take necessary steps to prevent any escape from
custody and remain under a duty to properly investigate any alleged crime.
