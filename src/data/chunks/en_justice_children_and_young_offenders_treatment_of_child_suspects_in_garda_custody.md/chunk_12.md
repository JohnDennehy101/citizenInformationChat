###  **Interviewing a child without an adult present**

However, if the Garda√≠ believe a delay in questioning a child suspect would
involve:

  * A risk of death or injury 
  * Serious loss of or damage to property 
  * Destruction of or interference with evidence, or 
  * The escape of accomplices 

Then the Garda in charge of the station can authorise the questioning of the
child or the taking of a written statement in the absence of a parent or
guardian. This is not a common practice, however, and very serious
circumstances must exist before the Garda in charge would allow it.
