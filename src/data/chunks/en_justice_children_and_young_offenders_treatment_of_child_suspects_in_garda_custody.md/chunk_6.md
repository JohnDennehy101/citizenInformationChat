###  Separation of children from adults in Garda stations

When a child is detained in a Garda station it is the duty of the Garda in
charge of the station to ensure that, as far as possible, the child is not
allowed meet with or associate with adult suspects being detained in the
station at the same time.

Children are usually not kept in a cell unless there is no other safe or
secure accommodation available.
