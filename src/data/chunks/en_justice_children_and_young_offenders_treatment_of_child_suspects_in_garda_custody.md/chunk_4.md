###  **Offences a child can be arrested or detained for**

Children under 12 years of age cannot be arrested and detained in a Garda
station unless the offence is one of the following:

  * Murder 
  * Manslaughter 
  * Rape 
  * Aggravated sexual assault 

In any other situation where a Garda has reasonable grounds for believing that
a child under 12 years of age has committed an offence, the Garda must bring
the child to the childâ€™s parents or guardian.

These laws are found under [ Section 53 of the Children Act 2001
