###  **Removing an adult during Garda questioning of a child**

The Garda in charge can also remove the nominated adult during the questioning
of a child suspect or during the taking of a written statement if:

  * The parent or guardian is the victim of, or has been arrested in connection with, the offence being investigated 
  * The Garda in charge suspects the parent or guardian of being involved in the offence, or 
  * The Garda in charge believes the parent or guardian would be likely to obstruct the course of justice if they were present during the interview of the child or during the taking of a written statement from the child.
