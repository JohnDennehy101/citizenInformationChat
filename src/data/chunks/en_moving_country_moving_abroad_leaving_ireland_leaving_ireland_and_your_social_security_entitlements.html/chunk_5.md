###  **Social insurance record**

If you need to [ claim a social security benefit while living abroad
](https://www.gov.ie/en/service/cf633a-claiming-benefits-abroad/) , you will
be asked to provide information about your Irish social insurance record.

Forms U1 and E104 are needed when claiming sickness, maternity or unemployment
benefits abroad.

The U1 is called a _portable document_ and it provides details of your [ Irish
social insurance record ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-
welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/social-insurance-prsi/social-insurance-in-
ireland/) . If you don’t bring your U1 with you, the country you have moved to
will contact Irish authorities to get a record of your insurance contributions
when you apply to them.

Requests for an E104 form (used for health related benefits) can only be made
by the authority in the relevant EU member state.

A request from another EU/EEA member state for your social insurance record
will be prioritised by the Department of Social Protection (DSP) so that you
don’t lose out on any benefits due to you when abroad.
