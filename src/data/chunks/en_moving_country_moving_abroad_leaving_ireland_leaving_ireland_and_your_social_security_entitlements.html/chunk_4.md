##  Countries covered by EU Regulations

If you move to live or work in a country covered by EU Regulations, you are
entitled to be treated in the same way as the nationals in that EU/EEA member
state for social security benefits or services. This means that you and your
family are entitled to apply for any benefits or assistance available in that
country.

If you are applying for insurance-based payments, social insurance
contributions made in other EU/EEA member states can be taken into account.
