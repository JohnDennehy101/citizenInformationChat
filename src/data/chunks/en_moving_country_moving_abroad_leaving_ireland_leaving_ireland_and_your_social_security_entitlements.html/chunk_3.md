was signed by both countries on 1 February 2019. Under the terms of the
Convention, pre-existing arrangements with regard to recognition of, and
access to, social insurance entitlements will be maintained in both
jurisdictions. This means that the rights of Irish citizens living in Ireland
to benefit from social insurance contributions made when working in the UK
will be protected and vice versa.
