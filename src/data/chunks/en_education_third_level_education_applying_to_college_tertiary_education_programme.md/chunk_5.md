##  Tertiary course fees

You start your course in a further education college, usually an Education and
Training Board (ETB). There is no tuition fee or student contribution to pay
during your course in the ETB.

When you progress to a third-level college, tuition fees and the student
contribution fee will apply. You should check if you qualify for [ free fees
