##  What is the tertiary education programme?

The [ tertiary education programme ](https://www.gov.ie/en/policy-
information/fd38f-tertiary-programmes/) is a new way to get a degree at third
level.

How the programme works:

  1. You start your course in a further education college, usually an Education and Training Board (ETB). You will attend the ETB for 1 to 2 years depending on your course. There are no fees when you attend an ETB. 
  2. You then progress to third level to complete your degree in a higher education college or university. There are course fees when you move to third level, but you may qualify for [ free fees ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/education/third-level-education/fees-and-supports-for-third-level-education/fees/) and a [ student grant ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/education/third-level-education/fees-and-supports-for-third-level-education/student-grant-scheme/) . 

All courses lead to a degree at Level 7 or 8 on the [ National Framework of
Qualifications (NFQ) ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/education/third-
level-education/colleges-and-qualifications/fet-qualifications/#828dc6) .

[ Step-back awards ](https://www.gov.ie/en/policy-information/fd38f-tertiary-
programmes/) recognising the learning completed can be provided to students
who donâ€™t finish the programme.
