##  Do I need Leaving Cert or CAO points?

No. You do not apply through the [ CAO
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/education/third-level-
education/applying-to-college/application-procedures-and-entry-requirements/)
and you do not need the same [ Leaving Certificate
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/education/state-examinations/leaving-
certificate/) points. However, there are entry requirements to get on a course
with the [ Tertiary education programme ](https://www.gov.ie/en/policy-
information/fd38f-tertiary-programmes/) . Each course has its own entry
requirements.

You can find out about the course and the [ entry requirements from the course
provider or coordinator ](https://nto.hea.ie/courses/) . They can give you
more information about what you might need to include with your application.
