###  Junior Counsel

When barristers are first "called to the Bar", they act as Junior Counsel. A
Junior Counsel may have the letters BL after their name, which stand for
"Barrister at Law".

Junior Counsel tend to do most of the paperwork in cases (drafting legal
documents) and they represent clients mainly in the lower courts (the [
District Court ](/en/justice/courts-system/district-court/) and the [ Circuit
Court ](/en/justice/courts-system/circuit-court/) ).
