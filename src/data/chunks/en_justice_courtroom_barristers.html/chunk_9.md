###  Senior Counsel

After about 10 to 15 years of practising as a Junior Counsel, a barrister may
[ apply ](https://www.lsra.ie/for-law-professionals/applications-for-senior-
counsel/) to become a Senior Counsel. This is sometimes called "taking silk"
because the Senior Counsel's gown was traditionally made of silk. A Senior
Counsel may have the letters SC after their name.

Senior Counsel are very experienced advocates who represent clients in the [
High Court ](/en/justice/courts-system/high-court/) , the [ Court of Appeal
](/en/justice/courts-system/court-of-appeal/) and the [ Supreme Court
](/en/justice/courts-system/supreme-court/) . Usually, if a Senior Counsel is
involved in a case, there will also be a Junior Counsel to assist.

Experienced and/or specialist solicitors can also apply to become a Senior
Counsel and use the letters SC after their name. Solicitors appointed Senior
Counsel remain solicitors.
