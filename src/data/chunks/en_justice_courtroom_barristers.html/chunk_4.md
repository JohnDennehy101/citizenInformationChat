###  Can I hire a barrister?

Barristers are not typically “hired” directly by a member of the public – they
are generally engaged by [ solicitors ](/en/justice/courtroom/solicitors/) to
work on a case and always when a matter is contentious. However, some non-
contentious matters can be dealt with by certain barristers hired by a member
of the public. If you contact a solicitor for legal advice, your solicitor may
recommend that a barrister be engaged to provide services.

Barristers operate on a ‘taxi-system’ and must be available to take work from
any solicitor who engages them, regardless of the size and resources of the
solicitor’s firm.

If you and your solicitor decide to engage a barrister, the solicitor will
send the barrister a brief containing all the relevant information and
documents to assist the barrister in the presentation of the case.
