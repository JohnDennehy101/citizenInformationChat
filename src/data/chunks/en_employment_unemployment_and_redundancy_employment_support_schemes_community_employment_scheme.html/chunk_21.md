####  Leaving and re-entry to Community Employment

If you leave a CE scheme, you cannot participate in another CE scheme for 12
months after you leave, and you must be getting a qualifying payment for those
12 months.

If you have the opportunity of full-time work, you can take one period of
temporary unpaid leave with your sponsorâ€™s agreement for up to 26 weeks. If
the work opportunity continues beyond 26 weeks, you must leave the CE scheme.

Contact your [ local Intreo Centre or Social Welfare Branch Office
](https://www.gov.ie/en/directory/category/e1f4b5-intreo-offices/) for further
information about Community Employment.
