###  **Getting other payments and CE**

If you get a place on a CE scheme and your spouse or partner is claiming
Disability Allowance (DA) or Farm Assist in their own right, they can claim an
Increase for a Qualified Adult with their DA or Farm Assist. Your income from
the CE scheme (as a single person) is then assessed as insurable employment
against their payment.
