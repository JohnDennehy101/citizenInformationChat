###  Extra benefits of the CE scheme

You will keep your medical card when you are on CE.

You will keep your entitlement to the extra benefits you were getting
immediately before going onto CE, provided you continue to satisfy the
conditions for these benefits.

The amount of [ Rent Supplement ](/en/social-welfare/supplementary-welfare-
schemes/rent-supplement/) that you get may be reduced. You may be able to keep
part of your [ Mortgage Interest Supplement. ](/en/social-
welfare/supplementary-welfare-schemes/mortgage-interest-supplement/)

Since January 2024 the minimum weekly payment for new participants based on
19.5 hours worked is €259.50.

If the actual social welfare payment (including dependants) you were getting
was **€232 a week or less** , then you will get the minimum CE weekly rate of
€259.50 (that is €232 plus €27.50).

If your actual weekly social welfare payment (including dependants) was **€232
or more** , then you will get the same rate as your social welfare payment
plus €27.50.
