##  How long can I stay on the CE scheme?

If you are aged between 21 and 55 years, your CE placement generally lasts for
one year. However, if you are working towards a major education award, your CE
placement can be extended by up to 2 years to complete this award. You wonâ€™t
get an extension beyond 3 years (or 4 years for people on a disability-linked
social welfare payment).

If you are aged over 55, you can stay on CE for 3 consecutive years.

If you are aged 60 years and over and meet the CE eligibility requirements,
you can stay continuously on CE until you qualify for a State pension, once
you meet the terms and conditions of the scheme and providing that there are
places available.

In general, the maximum amount of time you can spend on a CE scheme over your
lifetime is 6 years (7 years if you are getting a disability-linked social
welfare payment).

Participation on a CE scheme in the 7 years before the current year will not
count towards the overall limit of 6 years in a lifetime (7 years if you are
getting a disability-linked social welfare payment).
