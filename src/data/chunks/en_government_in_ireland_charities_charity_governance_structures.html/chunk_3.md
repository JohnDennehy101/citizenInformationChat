##  Types of charity structure

**Charitable trusts**

A charitable trust is established under a deed of trust. This means that the
trustees must use all of the trust’s property to advance the charity’s purpose
(except for money used to manage the trust).

**Corporate bodies**

Charities are often established as companies. These are usually companies
limited by guarantee and governed by a constitution (formerly known as a
memorandum and articles of association). Companies are subject to company law
and must comply with rules about keeping accounts and records. Company law is
enforced by the [ Companies Registration Office ](https://www.cro.ie/) and the
[ Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement ](http://www.odce.ie/) .

**Unincorporated associations**

Smaller charitable organisations can be unincorporated associations governed
by a constitution or set of rules. These organisations are like clubs and
consist of people bound together by mutual agreement, who meet on a regular
basis to pursue a common interest.

The constitution is binding for members of the organisation, but it has no
legal effect on non-members. Therefore, anything done by the organisation is
done by all the members of the organisation, who are responsible for all the
activities of the organisation. Individual members are personally liable for
any of the organisation’s debts or obligations.

An unincorporated association is not a separate legal entity from its members,
and it does not have limited liability or a legal personality of its own. This
means that it cannot enter into contracts or own property.
