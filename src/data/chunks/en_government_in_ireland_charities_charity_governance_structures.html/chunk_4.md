##  Charity trustees

Charity trustees are the people who control and are legally responsible for
the management of a charity. Charity trustees include:

  * Trustees listed in the deed of trust of a charitable trust, if they are the ones who decide policy and control the assets 
  * The directors and other officers of a company where the charity is a company. They will have additional duties under company law and common law in their capacity as a company director. 
  * Officers, or anyone acting officially in control of the organisation such as committee members, in cases where the organisation is an unincorporated group 

You cannot profit from your duties as a charity trustee. You cannot accept a
salary or receive other benefits specifically for acting as a charity trustee.
However, your charity can reimburse you for any reasonable expenses that arise
from undertaking your duties as a trustee.

**Duties of a trustee**

Your duties as a charity trustee are set out in the governing document of your
charity, legislation and _common law_ (the body of Irish law based on
established practice and decisions of the courts). You have specific duties
under the Charities Act 2009 and are also required to ensure that your charity
complies with other relevant legislation.

Your general duties as a trustee are to:

  * Comply with your charity’s governing document 
  * Ensure that your charity is carrying out its charitable purposes for the public benefit 
  * Act in the best interests of your charity 
  * Manage the assets of your charity 
  * Make appropriate investment decisions 
  * Ensure that your charity is registered on the [ Charities Regulator’s Register of Charities ](https://www.charitiesregulator.ie/en/information-for-the-public/search-the-register-of-charities)
  * Ensure that your charity keeps proper books of account (these must include daily entries of all money your charity receives and pays out, as well as a record of your charity’s assets and liabilities) 
  * Ensure that your charity prepares and gives its financial accounts to the Charities Regulator 
  * Ensure that your charity prepares and gives its annual report to the Charities Regulator 
  * Ensure that you comply with any directions issued by the Charities Regulator 
  * Ensure that you inform the Charities Regulator if you think that a theft or fraud has taken place at the charity 

Trustees must also ensure that their charity complies with the requirements of
other relevant legislation, for example, [ data protection
](http://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/government_in_ireland/data_protection/)
, [ health and safety
](http://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/employment/employment_rights_and_conditions/health_and_safety/)
and [ employment legislation
](http://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/employment/employment_rights_and_conditions/)
.

**Who cannot be a trustee?**

You cannot be a trustee of a charitable organisation if you:

  * Are bankrupt 
  * Enter into an [ insolvency arrangement ](/en/money-and-tax/personal-finance/debt/personal-insolvency/personal-insolvency-arrangements/) under the [ Personal Insolvency Act 2012 ](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2012/act/44/enacted/en/html)
  * Are convicted of an offence 
  * Are sentenced to a term of imprisonment 
  * Are disqualified from acting as a director or auditor or from managing a company under the [ Companies Acts 2014 as amended ](http://revisedacts.lawreform.ie/eli/2014/act/38/revised/en/html)
  * Are disqualified from being a pension fund trustee under the Pensions Acts 
  * Have been removed from the position of a charity trustee by a High Court order under the Charities Act 2009 

If the trustee is a legal entity such as a company, they cannot be a trustee
if the company is being wound up.

If you cannot be a trustee because you fall into one of the categories above,
you can apply to the High Court and ask to be allowed to work as a trustee of
a particular charity or a particular class of charities. The High Court can
make an order that allows you to be a trustee if it considers that this would
be in the public interest and best interests of the charity concerned.

It is an offence to act as a trustee if you fall into one of the categories
above and have not received an order from the High Court that allows you to
work as a trustee.
