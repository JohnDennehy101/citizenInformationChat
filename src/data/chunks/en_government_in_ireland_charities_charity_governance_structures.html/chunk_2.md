##  Introduction

Charitable organisations in Ireland are usually structured in one of 3 ways:

  * As a unincorporated association 
  * As a corporate body 
  * As a charitable trust 

Charity trustees are the people who control and are legally responsible for
managing a charity. Charity trustees have specific duties set out by the [
Charities Act 2009
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2009/act/6/enacted/en/html) .

The [ Charities Regulatory Authority ](/en/government-in-
ireland/charities/charities-regulatory-authority/) (Charities Regulator) is
the statutory body that monitors charitiesâ€™ compliance with the Act.
