####  Impotence

At the time of the marriage ceremony, one of you was impotent and therefore
unable to consummate the marriage. Impotence is the inability to have sexual
intercourse. You cannot obtain a declaration of nullity because one of you is
infertile or because one of you is refusing to consummate the marriage. It
must be the case that one of you is incapable of sexual intercourse.
