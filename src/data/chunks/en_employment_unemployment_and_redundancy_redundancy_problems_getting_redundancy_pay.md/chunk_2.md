##  What to do if you have trouble getting your redundancy pay

Your employer should pay the redundancy lump sum to you when your employment
ends. For example, this could be the last day of your notice period or on your
next pay day.

Contact your employer if you donâ€™t get your statutory redundancy pay when you
are entitled to it. Do this in writing to make sure there is a record. You can
apply to your employer using form [ RP77 (pdf)
](http://www.workplacerelations.ie/en/Publications_Forms/Claim_by_an_Employee_Against_an_Employer_for_a_Lump_Sum_or_Part_of_a_Lump_Sum_RP77_.pdf)
.

You must apply to your employer for redundancy pay within one year from the
date your employment ends.

If your employer cannot pay or they are insolvent, you can apply to get the
payment from the Government under the [ Redundancy Payment Scheme
](https://www.gov.ie/en/service/78213a-redundancy-
payments/?referrer=https://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/Guide-to-the-Redundancy-
Payments-Scheme.aspx) .
