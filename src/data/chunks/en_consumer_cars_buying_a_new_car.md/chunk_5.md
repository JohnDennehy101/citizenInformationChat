###  Hire purchase (HP) agreements

HP is a type of credit that is often offered by garages and car dealers. Under
HP, you rent the car, and pay the cost in regular instalments to your lender
(who is usually a bank, a building society or finance companies). You can use
the car but cannot sell it without the lenderâ€™s permission. The lender owns
the car until you make the final payment. Read more about [ hire purchase
