##  Electric vehicle grants

You may be able to get a grant from the Sustainable Energy Authority Ireland
(SEAI) if you buy a battery-powered electric vehicle (BEV) that meets specific
standards.

Since 1 July 2023, you can get a grant of up to €3,500 for battery-powered
electric vehicles (BEV). (Previously, the grant was €5,000).

The grant for BEVs **only applies to cars with a full price of between €14,000
and €60,000** .

Your car dealer will apply for the grant for you, and then deduct the grant
amount from the total price of your car.

Since 1 January 2022, the grant of €2,500 for plug-in hybrid electric vehicles
(PHEV) has been removed.
