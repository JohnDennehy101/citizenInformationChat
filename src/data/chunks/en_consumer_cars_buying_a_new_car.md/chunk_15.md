###  Registration plates

If you buy your car from a dealer, they must register it and give you [
registration plates ](/en/travel-and-recreation/vehicle-standards/vehicle-
registration-numbers/) when you collect your car. You must display the plates
on your car **within 3 days** from the registration date.

The dealer must also have the new registration plates fitted before you take
it away.

If you register the car yourself at an NCT centre and your VRT payment has
been accepted, Revenue will give you the registration number assigned to the
vehicle. You can buy Irish number plates at the NCT centre on the day of the
inspection.

You must register the vehicle before you can pay motor tax. It is an offence
to drive an unregistered vehicle in Ireland.
