##  Your consumer rights

When you buy a new car from a garage or car dealer, you are entering into a
consumer contract. You have the same consumer rights as when you [ buy any
other products ](/en/consumer/shopping/rights-when-buying-in-a-shop/) from a
business.

You can expect the car to meet certain conditions of quality and durability
and match what was set out in the contract. You are entitled to certain
_remedies_ if something goes wrong after you buy. Remedies could be a repair,
replacement, refund or price reduction. Read more about [ your consumer rights
](/en/consumer/consumer-laws/your-consumer-rights/) and [ problems with faulty
goods ](/en/consumer/shopping/problems-with-faulty-goods/) .

Consumer rights only apply to deals between a _consumer_ (a person who buys
something for personal use or consumption) and a _trader_ (a person who sells
goods or services as part of their trade, business or profession).
