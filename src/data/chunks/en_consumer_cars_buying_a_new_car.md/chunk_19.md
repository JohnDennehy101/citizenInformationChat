##  Vehicle labelling

A colour-coded labelling system for new cars shows their carbon dioxide (CO2)
emissions. These labels are displayed on, or near, any new car for sale.

The first section of the label shows the emission band for the vehicle. The
second section of the label tells you:

  * How much fuel the vehicle will use over 18,000km 
  * The annual motor tax 
  * The rate of VRT 

Other sections give information such as the make, engine capacity, and fuel
type of the car.
