##  Motor tax

By law, you must pay motor tax for your vehicle. You can pay motor tax for a
new vehicle:

  * By post 
  * In person at your [ local motor tax office ](https://www.gov.ie/en/service/1fc151-find-your-local-motor-tax-office/)
  * Online at [ motortax.ie ](https://www.motortax.ie/OMT/) . 

The amount of tax depends on the type of car you have bought. For new cars,
motor tax is calculated on the vehicleâ€™s CO2 emissions. When taxing a new or
imported car, you will need to provide the RF100 form (from the motor dealer).
