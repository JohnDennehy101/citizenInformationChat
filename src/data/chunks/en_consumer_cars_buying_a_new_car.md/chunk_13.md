###  Registering a car yourself (without a dealer)

In all other cases (for example, where you buy a car abroad and bring it into
Ireland), you are responsible for registering the vehicle at a [ National Car
Testing Service Centre (NCTS) ](https://www.ncts.ie/) . You can book an
appointment online or over-the-phone. The following timeframes apply:

  * **Booking an appointment for vehicle testing:** this must be done within 7 days of the vehicle entering Ireland 
  * **Registering the vehicle:** this must be done within 30 days of it arriving into Ireland
