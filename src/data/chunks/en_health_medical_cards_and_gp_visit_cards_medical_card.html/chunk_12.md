###  **Selecting a doctor**

The HSE have [ a list of doctors that accept medical card patients (pdf
](https://www.sspcrs.ie/libr/html/AllGPs_GMSContract.pdf) ).

If you apply online, the HSE will contact the doctor you select and ask them
to accept you as a medical card patient.

If you apply using the printed application form, you can call the GP that you
have chosen from the [ list of participating doctors (pdf)
](https://www.sspcrs.ie/libr/html/AllGPs_GMSContract.pdf) . Usually, the GP
you select must be within 7 miles of where you live. If the GP agrees to
accept you as a patient for [ medical card GP services ](/en/health/health-
services/gp-and-hospital-services/gp-services-to-medical-card-holders/) , you
can send them the form to sign.

If you use the printed application form and you have been a medical card
patient within the last 6 months and you want to keep the same GP, you should
state this on your form.

If your preferred participating GP cannot accept you as a medical card
patient, they may not be currently accepting new patients and you should try
another [ participating GP in your area (pdf)
](https://www.sspcrs.ie/libr/html/AllGPs_GMSContract.pdf) .

If you are refused by 3 GPs, the HSE will assign a doctor to you. State this
on your application, including the 3 names of declining GPs and their clinics.
The GPs need to be based at three different clinics.
