###  **Medical card reviews and renewals**

You may be sent a letter with a PIN code from the HSE, inviting you to use the
online medical card application system to review your medical card.

If you do not provide the information they ask for, your application cannot be
re-assessed and your card may not be re-issued.

If you need a paper form, rather than the online review form, complete and
return [ MC1 Medical Card and GP Visit Card Application Form (pdf)
](https://assets.hse.ie/media/documents/Medical_Card_and_GP_Visit_Card_Application_Form.pdf)
. If you are aged over 70, the review notice you get will include a form that
you can use instead of the online review form.

If you complete the review form by the given date but the review process
continues past the expiry date of your card, the cardâ€™s validity may be
extended so that you can continue to use it while the review is taking place.
The extension is on a month-by-month basis so you should contact the Client
Registration Unit to confirm that your card has been extended and continues to
be valid.
