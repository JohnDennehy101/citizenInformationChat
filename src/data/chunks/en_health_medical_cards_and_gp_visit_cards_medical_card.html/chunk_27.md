###  **Appealing if you are refused a medical card**

If you have been refused a medical card and are not satisfied with the
decision, you may have it reviewed. Your circumstances may have changed or you
may have left out some relevant information from the original application. The
contact details will also be contained in your letter of refusal.

The Appeals Office will conduct a reassessment of your application. This will
be conducted by HSE staff who were not involved in deciding on your original
application. You can read about [ appealing a medical card decision on the HSE
website ](https://www2.hse.ie/services/schemes-allowances/medical-
cards/applying/appeal/) .
