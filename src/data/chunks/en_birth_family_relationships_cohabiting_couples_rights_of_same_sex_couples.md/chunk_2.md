##  Introduction

A statutory civil partnership registration scheme for same-sex couples was
introduced in Ireland in 2011. Following a vote in favour of marriage equality
in a [ constitutional referendum ](/en/government-in-ireland/elections-and-
referenda/voting/electoral-commission/) in November 2015, same sex couples now
have the right to marry.
