##  EU citizens and their family members

The [ European Communities (Free Movement of Persons) Regulations 2015
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2015/si/548/made/en/print) transpose [ EU
Directive 2004/38/EC
](http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/justice_freedom_security/free_movement_of_persons_asylum_immigration/l33152_en.htm)
into Irish law. The Regulations allow EU citizens and their family members the
right to ‘facilitation of entry’ and residence in Ireland.

The Regulations also widen the definition of ‘family member’, to include:

  * A partner with whom the EU citizen has a ‘valid durable relationship’ 
  * The dependent parents 
  * Children under 21 and other dependent children of that partner
