##  Same-sex cohabitants

Cohabitants are 2 adults of the same-sex or opposite-sex, who are:

  * Not married to each other or in a registered civil partnership 
  * Not related within the [ prohibited degrees of relationship ](/en/birth-family-relationships/getting-married/legal-prerequisites-for-marriage#l3b8db) (for example, certain people related by blood or marriage cannot get married) 
  * Living together in an intimate and committed relationship 

The [ Civil Partnership and Certain Rights and Obligations of Cohabitants Act
2010 ](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2010/en/act/pub/0024/index.html) changed
a number of existing laws, so that the rights available to opposite-sex
couples living together are also available to same-sex couples living
together. For example:

  * The [ Residential Tenancies Act 2004 ](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2004/en/act/pub/0027/index.html) was amended so that a same-sex cohabitant of a deceased tenant has the right to inherit a tenancy 
  * The [ Civil Liability Act 1961 ](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1961/en/act/pub/0041/index.html) now gives a same-sex cohabitant of a deceased person the right to sue for damages in the event of the cohabitantâ€™s wrongful death 
  * _Qualified cohabitants_ as defined in the 2010 Act are now entitled to be informed about the registration of an [ enduring power of attorney ](/en/death/before-a-death/power-of-attorney/) under the [ Powers of Attorney Act 1996 ](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1996/en/act/pub/0012/index.html)
