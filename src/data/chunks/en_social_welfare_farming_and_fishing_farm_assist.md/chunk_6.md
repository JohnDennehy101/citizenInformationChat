###  Income from farm schemes and direct payments

Payments from certain farm schemes, for example, the Rural Environmental
Protection Scheme (REPS), the Agri-Environmental Options Scheme (AEOS), the
Special Area of Conservation (SAC) or the [ Green Low-Carbon Agri-Environment
Scheme (GLAS) ](http://www.agriculture.gov.ie/farmerschemespayments/glas/) are
treated as follows:

  * The first €5,000 per year of payments is disregarded then 
  * 50% of the balance is also disregarded 
  * Expenses incurred in complying with these measures are deducted 

And

  * The balance is assessed as means. 

You can find a [ full list of farm schemes that qualify for the disregard on
gov.ie ](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/3c0a96-operational-guidelines-farm-
assist/#direct-payment-scheme) .

Under the Direct Payment system, a farmer’s payment can be a combination of
payments under 4 separate schemes. These are the Basic Payment Scheme (BPS),
the Greening Payment, the Young Farmer’s Scheme (YFS) and Aid for Protein
Crops. Direct payments do not get the above disregards.
