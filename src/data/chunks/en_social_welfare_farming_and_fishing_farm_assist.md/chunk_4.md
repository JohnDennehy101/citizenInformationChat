##  How your income is assessed for Farm Assist

In a means test the Department of Social Protection examines all your sources
of income. To get FA, your income must be below a certain amount.

The some of the items included in the means test are:

  * **Cash income** that you or your spouse, civil partner or cohabitant may have. There is [ some cash income not included in the means test ](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/means-test-for-social-welfare-payments/cash-income-not-included-in-the-social-welfare-means-test/) . 
  * **Capital** , for example, the value of savings, investments, shares or any property you have (but not your own home). The first â‚¬20,000 of your capital is not taken into account.
