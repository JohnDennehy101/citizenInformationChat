###  Supports for homeless people

Funding of â‚¬194 million has been made available for homeless services in
2022\. This will support local authorities providing emergency accommodation
and other services and help people to exit homelessness to tenancies as
quickly as possible. Additional health supports have been allocated to assist
with this.
