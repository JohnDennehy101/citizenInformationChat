###  Community service orders

Community service orders (CSOs) are provided for by the [ Criminal Justice
(Community Service) Act 1983
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1983/en/act/pub/0023/index.html) as amended
by the Criminal Justice (Community Service) (Amendment) (No. 2) Act 2011. A
CSO means that the person must do some work which is beneficial to the
community. CSOs are imposed by a judge instead of a prison sentence, where the
prison sentence would have been 12 months or less. A CSO can be made if you
are over 16.

A number of considerations must be met before a CSO can be made by a judge:

  * You must be suitable for community service (the judge orders a [ probation report ](/en/justice/probation-and-welfare-services/probation-service/) to decide whether you are suitable for a CSO) 
  * Suitable community work must be available for you to do 
  * You must agree to the CSO 

The amount of community service you get depends on the Court, but it cannot
exceed 240 hours. You must complete the community service within one year of
when the CSO was made.
