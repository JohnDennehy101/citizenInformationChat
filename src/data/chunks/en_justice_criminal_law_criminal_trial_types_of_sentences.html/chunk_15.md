###  Probation orders

The [ Probation of Offenders Act 1907
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1907/act/17/enacted/en/html) provides the
courts with a way of dealing with first-time offenders and offenders who are
unlikely to be in trouble again. It lets the courts give these offenders a
type of official warning without imposing a sentence on them. A probation
order requires you to be of good behaviour. It may also contain certain
conditions such as:

  * Payment of compensation 
  * Residing at a particular place 
  * Supervision 
  * Any other conditions considered necessary to prevent a repeat of the offence (for example, attending counselling) 

It will be recorded that you have benefited from the Probation Act. If you
appear before the courts again this may be taken into consideration.
