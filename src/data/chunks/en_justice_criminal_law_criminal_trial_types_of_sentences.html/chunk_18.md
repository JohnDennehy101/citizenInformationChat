###  Forfeiture and confiscation

Various laws provide judges with the power to order property, which is
connected with the offence you have been convicted of, to be forfeited or
confiscated. For example, under [ Section 10 of the Censorship of Publications
Act 1929
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1929/en/act/pub/0021/sec0010.html#zza21y1929s10)
prohibited publications may be confiscated.
