###  Maximum sentences

The law lays down maximum sentences for all crimes. For example, if you are
found guilty of violent disorder under [ Section 15 of the Criminal Justice
(Public Order) Act 1994
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1994/en/act/pub/0002/sec0015.html#zza2y1994s15)
, the maximum sentence you can receive is 10 years imprisonment.

In practice maximum sentences are reserved for only the most serious cases.
The maximum sentence is always open to a judge even if you have pleaded guilty
to an offence.
