###  Orders for drug trafficking offenders

The Criminal Justice Act 2006 introduced a system for convicted drug
traffickers similar to those mentioned for sex offenders. The court can make
an order which obliges you to notify the Garda√≠ of your name and address.

The order is only made if the court considers that it is in the interest of
the common good and that it is appropriate, given the circumstances of your
case. More information is available in the [ document on the Drug Offenders
Register ](/en/justice/criminal-law/criminal-trial/drug-offenders-register/) .
