###  Disqualification

Disqualification orders are not a punishment, but rather a finding that a
person is unfit to perform the function from which they are disqualified, for
example, to drive a car. In some cases disqualification is mandatory, and in
others cases disqualification is something the court chooses to impose.

The most common types of disqualifications are for convictions for driving
offences. However, under [ Chapter 4 of the Companies Act 2014
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2014/act/38/enacted/en/print) , a person,
convicted on indictment of a criminal offence related to a company, can be
disqualified from holding certain positions related to running a company, such
as a director.
