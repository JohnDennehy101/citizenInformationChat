###  Binding over

Courts have a long-standing power that allows them to bind you over to keep
the peace and be of good behaviour. This involves you entering into a
recognisance (or monetary bond) for a period of time. If you get into trouble
during the time stated in the order, you must pay that sum of money or face
imprisonment.
