##  What is the Household Benefits Package?

The Household Benefits Package (HBP) helps with the cost of your electricity
or gas bill and the TV licence.

You do not have to be living alone to get the Household Benefits Package.
However, only one person in a household can get the Package.

You can get the Household Benefits Package if you are **aged 70 or over** .
You do not need to be getting a State pension and the package is not means
tested.

People **under 70** can also get the HBP, but additional rules apply – see
‘How to qualify for the Household Benefits Package’ below.
