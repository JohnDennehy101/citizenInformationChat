##  Buying a vehicle with a registered owner deceased

If you buy a vehicle and the current owner (seller) is deceased, you will need
the Vehicle Registration Certificate and a letter to show you have the right
to the vehicle. This can be a letter from:

  * The executor of the deceased's will, or 
  * The solicitor dealing with the will
