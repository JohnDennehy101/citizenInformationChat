##  Financial support

The Department of Social Protection provides social welfare payments to
support families and specifically children. There are many different types of
families and social welfare payments are designed to support those most in
need of financial assistance.

[ Child Benefit ](/en/social-welfare/families-and-children/child-benefit/) is
the most common payment to families with children. It is paid for a child aged
under 16. You can get child Benefit for a child aged 16 or 17, if they are in
full-time education or full-time training or have a disability and cannot
support themselves. Child Benefit is not means-tested.

Other [ social welfare payments ](/en/social-welfare/families-and-
children/payments-to-families-and-children/) depend on your family
circumstances and other factors, such as whether you have enough PRSI
contributions or you are on a low income.
