##  Buying from a private seller

Private sellers advertise used cars through third-party auction websites,
online marketplaces or in the small ads section of newspapers and car
magazines.

If you buy from a private seller, you have very few legal rights. Consumer
laws only apply to deals between a _consumer_ (a person who buys a good or
service for personal consumption) and a _trader_ (a person acting for purposes
related to their trade, business or profession). It does not apply when you
buy from a private individual who is not a trader, for example, someone who is
selling their own car to you but who does not sell cars as a profession.
