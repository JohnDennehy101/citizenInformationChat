###  Do your research before you buy

Before you buy from a private seller, make sure to ask if the car was bought
under a hire purchase (HP) or Personal Contract Plan (PCP) agreement. If the
current owner bought the car by HP or PCP, they do not own it until they have
made the final payment to the finance company. Check that all payments have
been made so that the car now belongs to the seller (not the finance company)
and they have a right to sell it. Find out more about [ hire purchase

Before you buy from a private seller, you should:

  * Check the carâ€™s history or ownership status through official records such as [ Motorcheck ](https://www.motorcheck.ie/) , [ Cartell ](https://www.cartell.ie/) , [ MyVehicle ](https://www.myvehicle.ie/) , or [ Carhistorycheck ](https://www.carhistorycheck.ie/default.aspx)
  * Check the car, both inside and out, for any wear and tear. The Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC) has a [ car purchase checklist ](https://www.ccpc.ie/consumers/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2017/04/Car-purchase-checklist.pdf) . 
  * Get a mechanic, an auto engineer or a person with some knowledge of car mechanics to inspect the car 
  * Shop around and ask questions before deciding to buy it 
  * Make sure the car has been serviced regularly and the service book has been filled in 
  * Pay using a secure method of payment, such as a credit or debit card or PayPal. Don't send money by bank or wire transfer. If you pay securely, you may be able to use chargeback in cases of scams or other fraud. 

You should be aware of [ scams ](/en/consumer/buying-digital-content-and-
services/scams-and-fraud/) . Unlike a trader, a private seller has no legal
duty to give you information you have not asked for.
