###  Change of vehicle ownership

When a vehicle is sold or traded in, both the seller and the buyer must make
sure that procedures for change of ownership registration are completed.

Some motor dealers may be approved to provide completed change of ownership
documentation to the Department of Transport on motortrans.ie.
