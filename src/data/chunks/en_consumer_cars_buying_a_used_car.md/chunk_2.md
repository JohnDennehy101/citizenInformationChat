##  Your consumer rights

It is often much cheaper to buy a second-hand or used car. You can buy a used
car:

  * From a garage or car dealer 
  * At a car auction 
  * Through a newspaper advert or online marketplace 

If you buy a used car from a trader (a garage, car dealer, or a business
selling on an online marketplace), you have similar consumer rights as when [
buying a new car ](/en/consumer/cars/buying-a-new-car/) .

You can expect the car to meet the certain conditions of quality and
durability and match what was set out in the contract. While you canâ€™t expect
a used car to be the same standard as a new one, the quality should reflect
the price you paid.

You may be entitled to certain remedies if something goes wrong after you buy.
Remedies could be a repair, replacement, refund or price reduction. Read more
about [ your consumer rights ](/en/consumer/consumer-laws/your-consumer-
rights/) and [ problems with faulty goods ](/en/consumer/shopping/problems-
with-faulty-goods/) .

If you buy a used car from a private seller or at an auction, you have fewer
legal rights.
