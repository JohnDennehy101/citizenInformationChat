###  Vehicle Registration Tax (VRT)

You must pay VRT when you register a vehicle in Ireland. All vehicles, except
those brought into Ireland temporarily by visitors, must be registered with [
Revenue ](https://www.revenue.ie/en/vrt/index.aspx) .

If you are buying an imported car from a garage or dealer, you should check if
the correct VRT has been paid and you must get the VRT registration
certificate.

If you import a car from another country yourself, you are responsible for
registering it at an [ NCTS (National Car Testing Service) centre
](https://www.ncts.ie/) . You must book an appointment with an NCTS centre
within 7 days of the vehicle entering Ireland. You must pay VRT at the NCTS
centre within 30 days of it arriving into Ireland. Find out more about [
importing a vehicle to Ireland ](/en/moving-country/moving-to-ireland/coming-
to-live-in-ireland/importing-car-into-ireland/) .

The vehicle must be registered before it can be driven. It is an offence to
drive an unregistered vehicle in Ireland.
