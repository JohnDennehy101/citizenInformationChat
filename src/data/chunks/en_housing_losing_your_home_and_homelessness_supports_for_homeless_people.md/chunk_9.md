###  Social housing

Housing provided by local authorities or approved housing bodies is usually
referred to as _social housing_ .

Local authorities have general responsibility to provide housing for adults
who cannot afford to provide it for themselves. This is outlined under [ the
Housing Act 1988
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1988/en/act/pub/0028/index.html) . However,
they do not have a statutory obligation to house people.

They may help with accommodation by providing housing directly or through
arrangements with [ approved housing bodies ](/en/housing/local-authority-and-
social-housing/approved-housing-bodies/) . They may also provide funding to
approved housing bodies for emergency accommodation and for long-term housing
for homeless people.
