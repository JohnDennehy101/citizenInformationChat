##  Services if you are sleeping rough

Rough sleepers are people who are living and sleeping outdoors. Some community
services offer support and food to rough sleepers. For example, there are soup
runs providing sandwiches and hot drinks to rough sleepers in many urban
areas.

Street outreach teams befriend and engage with rough sleepers. They aim to
link rough sleepers with accommodation and other services to help them off the
streets and into long-term accommodation.

[ Some organisations ](/en/housing/losing-your-home-and-homelessness/agencies-
for-homeless-people/) provide medical and other services to rough sleepers,
including bathing and laundry facilities.

In Dublin, the [ Cold Weather Strategy
](https://www.homelessdublin.ie/extreme-weather-emergency-protocol) provides
additional emergency beds in the winter months for people who are sleeping
rough.
