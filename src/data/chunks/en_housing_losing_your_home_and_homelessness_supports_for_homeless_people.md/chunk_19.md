####  What if I am a migrant?

Most weekly means-tested payments require that you meet the [ habitual
residence condition ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-
welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/social-assistance-payments/habitual-
residence-condition/) , but you do not need to satisfy this condition in order
to get an Exceptional Needs Payment (see below).
