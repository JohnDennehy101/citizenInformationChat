###  What is transitional housing?

Transitional housing is for people who need time and support to prepare for
living independently. As well as providing medium-term accommodation, these
schemes generally:

  * Help people build their skills and capacity to establish themselves in a home 
  * Address any issues that the person might have that would make long-term housing challenging 

Transitional housing is always time-limited and usually ranges from 6 months
to 2 years.

Some projects focus on particular groups, such as:

  * Rough sleepers 
  * Single parents 
  * Young people leaving residential care 

The services vary from project to project but are directly linked to the needs
of residents. They can include:

  * Individual needs analysis 
  * Personal planning and support 
  * Court support 
  * Outreach 
  * Family support 
  * Counselling 
  * Advocacy 
  * Prison community links 
  * Education and employment support 
  * Life skills training programmes 

These services can only be accessed through referrals from other agencies.
Transitional housing is funded through local authorities, the Health Service
Executive (HSE) or local organisations, depending on the type of project.
Residents pay a weekly charge towards their accommodation.
