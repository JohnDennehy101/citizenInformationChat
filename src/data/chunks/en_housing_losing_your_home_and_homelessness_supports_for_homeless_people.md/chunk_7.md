###  **Hostels**

Hostels are the main form of emergency accommodation for single homeless
people. Hostel accommodation is not suitable for some people, due to the size
or make up of their household or because of the person's particular medical or
social needs.

In these situations, other emergency accommodation such as, bed and
breakfasts, hotels or family hubs are used. This will only happen if:

  * The person or household has been assessed as homeless 
  * The accommodation is provided as an emergency (short-term) response and is subject to ongoing review 
  * There should be active engagement with homeless services with a view to addressing all relevant issues 
  * All viable options for moving on are explored 
  * The person or household follows any house rules and other conditions of the accommodation 

Hostels can be short-term or long-term. Some provide dormitories or single
rooms and some include meals and other services. Some may charge for
accommodation on a nightly or weekly basis.

People who have been in emergency accommodation for a long time may be able to
access the [ Housing First ](https://www.housingagency.ie/housing-
information/housing-first) initiative.
