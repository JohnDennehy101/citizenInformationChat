###  Payments under the Supplementary Welfare Allowance scheme

The [ Supplementary Welfare Allowance (SWA)
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/social-welfare-
payments/supplementary-welfare-schemes/supplementary-welfare-allowance-
scheme/) scheme includes a [ Rent Supplement
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/social-welfare-
payments/supplementary-welfare-schemes/rent-supplement/) to help cover the
cost of rent. The [ Housing Assistance Payment (HAP)
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/housing/renting-a-home/housing-
assistance-payment/) is gradually replacing long-term Rent Supplement, but you
may be able to get Rent Supplement, depending on your situation - for example,
if you were living in accommodation for homeless people for at least 6 of the
last 12 months (183 days).

However, if you already qualify for social housing support, you will be
referred to your local authority to have your housing needs addressed (rather
than being assessed for Rent Supplement).

There may be flexibility in cases where rents are above the Rent Supplement
limits. This applies to existing tenants and to new Rent Supplement
applicants. The tenant's circumstances are considered on a case-by-case basis
and rents may be increased above the set limits as appropriate.

help tenants stay in their rented accommodation. The service operates in:
