###  **Family hubs and other supports for homeless families**

Family hubs aim to provide suitable emergency accommodation for families with
children who have lost their rented accommodation. They give families the
security of an ongoing placement, which they may not have in a hotel.

The hubs have separate bedrooms, homework and play spaces as well as laundry,
cooking and dining facilities.

Women and children who are experiencing domestic violence may be accommodated
in dedicated refuges.

**Extra supports for families in emergency accommodation**

Children under the age of 5 whose parents are homeless (or are moving from
homelessness to permanent accommodation) can get free childcare for up to 25
hours a week. This includes 15 hours of free pre-school ( [ ECCE
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/education/pre-school-education-and-
childcare/early-childhood-care-and-education-scheme/) ) where children
qualify, or school hours. It also includes a daily meal. Parents should not be
asked to pay any topâ€“up or co-payment for these part-time hours.

Free public transport is also available for families living in emergency
accommodation to cover their school journeys and family travel.
