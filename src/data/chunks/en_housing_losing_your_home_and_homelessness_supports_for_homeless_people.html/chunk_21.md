###  Other payments under the Supplementary Welfare Allowance scheme

The SWA scheme also includes a basic weekly payment and some discretionary
payments. You may qualify for the weekly payment if you do not qualify for any
other social welfare payment or if you are waiting for your claim for any
other payment to be processed.

You may qualify for a discretionary payment if you are in need. The most
relevant payment for homeless people is an [ Exceptional Needs Payment
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/social-welfare-
payments/supplementary-welfare-schemes/additional-needs-payment/) . This is a
one-off payment that you may get if you have unforeseen expenses such as:

  * Clothing 
  * Travel 
  * Rent deposit 
  * Costs relating to setting up a home that you could not reasonably be expected to meet from your weekly income 

This also includes buying furniture and appliances if you are moving into
local authority housing.
