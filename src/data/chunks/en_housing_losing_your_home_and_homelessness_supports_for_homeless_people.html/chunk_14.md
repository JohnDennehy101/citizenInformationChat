####  Housing Assistance Payment

If you are on the HAP scheme, the local authority pays your landlord directly.
You will pay a weekly HAP rent contribution to the local authority, based on
your income and your ability to pay.

In general, the rent must be within the HAP rent limits for your household
size and the area you live in. However, flexibility may be provided, on a
case-by-case basis, for households that cannot find suitable accommodation
within these limits.

The [ Homeless HAP scheme ](https://www.homelessdublin.ie/homeless-hap) ,
which is operated by the Dublin Region Homeless Executive, provides specific
flexibility for homeless households that qualify. Cork City Council is
operating a similar service for homeless households in Cork.

The [ Dublin Place Finder Service (pdf)
](https://councilmeetings.dublincity.ie/documents/s2209/HAP%20Dublin%20Place%20Finder.pdf)
supports homeless households in the Dublin region to find a tenancy using HAP.
Many local authorities in other areas now also have a Homeless HAP Place
Finder Service.

If you are in emergency homeless accommodation, your local authority may help
with any deposit or advance rental payments needed to get accommodation under
the HAP scheme. You should contact the housing section of your [ local
authority ](https://www.housing.gov.ie/local-government/administration/local-
authorities/local-authorities) for further information on this.
