##  Accessing your social welfare payment when you are homeless

Your right to social welfare payments does not change if you are homeless.
However, you may have difficulty getting your payments if you do not have a
permanent address. You can make any claims for payments such as [ Jobseekerâ€™s
Allowance ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/social-
welfare-payments/unemployed-people/jobseekers-allowance/) or [ illness and
disability payments ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-
welfare/social-welfare-payments/disability-and-illness/benefits-to-people-who-
are-sick-or-have-a-disability/) in the normal way.

For Rent Supplement and other payments under the Supplementary Welfare
Allowance Scheme (see below) you apply in the normal way, unless you are in
Dublin where you apply to the Homeless Persons Unit.
