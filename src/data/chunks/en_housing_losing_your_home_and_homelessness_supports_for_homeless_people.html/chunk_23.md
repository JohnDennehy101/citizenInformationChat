###  Address point service

An Post has set-up an [ address point service ](https://www.anpost.com/Media-
Centre/News/An-Post-launches-new-Address-Point-Service) , which gives people
without a fixed address a personal postal address and mail collection point.
You can use the address to access services that may be difficult or impossible
to get without an address, such as to:

  * Set-up a bank account 
  * Apply for jobs 
  * Register to vote 
  * Arrange medical appointments 

You can also use the address to keep in touch with family and friends. You
must register online for the free [ address point service
](https://www.anpost.com/AddressPoint) . You provide your name, your county
and select your local post office, and then your personal address is
generated. The address has no reference to the post office, but is completely
personal.

You can collect your post from your selected post office by showing photo
identification. Your post will be kept for a maximum of 20 days. After this,
it will be returned to the sender.
