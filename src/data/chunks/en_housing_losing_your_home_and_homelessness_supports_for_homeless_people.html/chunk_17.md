###  What is long-term supported housing?

Long-term supported housing is for people who would not be able to live
independently, due to problems like addiction or mental illness. They are
offered a home for as long as is needed, with support as necessary. Some
projects target people with particular care needs. Many approved housing
bodies offer long-term supported housing.

The [ Support to Live Independently (SLI)
](http://www.dubsimon.ie/Services/PreventingHomelessness/SupporttoLiveIndependently.aspx)
scheme provides long-term accommodation and supports to individuals and
families who are homeless to help them make the transition from homelessness
to independent living. It is for people who need low to moderate support and
is run by the Dublin Simon Community for the 4 Dublin Local Authorities.
