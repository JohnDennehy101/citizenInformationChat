###  What are settlement services?

Settlement services work with people who are homeless to help them to move
from homelessness and into long-term, sustainable housing. They carry out
assessments and draw up a settlement plan with each person.

They provide support to help homeless people access accommodation and prepare
for independent living. Post-settlement services provide time-limited tenancy
support to people who have moved to their own accommodation.
