##  Introduction

Capital Acquisitions Tax (CAT) is a tax on gifts and inheritances.

Some gifts and inheritances are exempt from CAT, so the tax does not apply.
For example, if they are from your spouse or civil partner.

There is an exemption for gifts of up â‚¬3,000 a year that you get from the same
person.

Some gifts and inheritances get tax relief, which reduces the amount of CAT
you have to pay. For example, there are tax reliefs if a gift or inheritance
is:

  * From your foster parent 
  * From an aunt or uncle whose business you worked in 
  * From a relative of your deceased spouse or civil partner 
  * A business or agricultural property 

This page explains the tax reliefs and exemptions for CAT.

All gifts and inheritances have a tax-free threshold, which means that you can
get a certain amount tax-free. The amount depends on your relationship to the
person you get them from.
