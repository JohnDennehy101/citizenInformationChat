###  Surviving spouse or surviving civil partner relief

This relief applies if your spouse or civil partner has died and you get a
gift or inheritance from someone who was more closely related to them than to
you. In that case, the group threshold that applies to you is based on the
relationship between the giver and your spouse or civil partner.

For example, if you get a benefit from the father of your spouse or civil
partner, the group threshold would be Group C. But if you get a benefit from
the father of your spouse or civil partner and your spouse or civil partner is
deceased, then the group threshold that applies to you would be the same as
for a child getting a benefit from a parent, Group A.
