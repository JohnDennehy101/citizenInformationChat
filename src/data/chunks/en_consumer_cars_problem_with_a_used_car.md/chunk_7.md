##  You bought from a private seller

You have very few legal rights when you buy a car from a private seller.
Consumer laws only apply to deals between a _consumer_ (a person who buys a
good or service for personal use or consumption) and a _trader_ (a person
acting for purposes related to their trade, business or profession). It does
not apply when you buy from a private individual who is not a trader (for
example, someone who is selling their own car to you but who does not sell
cars as a profession)

You should still contact the seller to try to work out a solution. If you
can't resolve the problem, you can [ take a civil case ](/en/justice/civil-
law/taking-and-appealing-a-civil-case/) or use the [ small claims procedure
](/en/justice/courts-system/small-claims-court/) .
