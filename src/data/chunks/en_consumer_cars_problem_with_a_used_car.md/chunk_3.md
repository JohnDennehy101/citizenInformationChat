##  You bought from a garage or car dealer

If a used car you bought develops a fault, you have the right to ask the
garage or car dealer to fix the problem by:

  * Repairing the faulty part(s) for free, within a reasonable time and without significant inconvenience to you 
  * Providing a replacement part or a car of similar quality or value 
  * Giving you a refund of the full price paid or a partial refund with a deduction for use (also known as recission)
