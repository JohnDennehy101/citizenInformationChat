##  You bought under a finance agreement

In all Hire Purchase and Personal Contract Plan (PCP) agreements, the car
remains the property of the finance company and ownership of the car does not
pass to you until the final instalment is paid.

If a car you bought under a Hire Purchase or PCP agreement is or becomes
faulty, both the seller and the owner (finance company) are responsible. You
can claim against either party in this situation. You cannot claim against the
car manufacturer.

If the seller agrees to give a refund, this will be provided to the finance
company who will usually:

  * End the finance agreement 
  * Pay you back your deposit plus any payments you have already made 
  * Deduct a certain amount for use of the vehicle
