##  Situations not covered by law

In some cases, you do not have a right to a repair or refund when there is a
fault with your used car.

This includes where:

  * You were told about the fault when you bought the car 
  * You (or your mechanic) inspected the car and should have spotted the problem, for example, a dent 
  * You caused the fault 
  * The fault is from normal wear and tear. This means it is normal considering how much the car has been used (for example, change of tyres or brake pads)
