###  Unresolved dispute with private seller

If you cannot resolve your dispute with a private seller, you can consider
taking legal action. If the amount involved is less than €2,000, you can take
a case to the small claims court using the [ small claims procedure
](/en/justice/courts-system/small-claims-court/) . For amounts over €2,000,
ask a solicitor about [ taking a civil case ](/en/justice/civil-law/taking-
and-appealing-a-civil-case/) .
