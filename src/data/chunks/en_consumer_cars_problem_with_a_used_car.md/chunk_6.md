##  You bought at an auction

When you buy a car at auction, it is usually ‘sold as seen’. It is up to you
to do the necessary checks by inspecting it before bidding (for example, by
getting a mechanic to examine the car before you buy).

If something goes wrong after you buy, the auction firm is not responsible.
Check the auction's conditions of sale before you buy.
