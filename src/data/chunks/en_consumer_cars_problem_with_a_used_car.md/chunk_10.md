###  Unresolved dispute with garage or car dealer

If your complaint can't be resolved and the garage or car dealer is a member
of the [ Society of the Irish Motor Industry (SIMI) ](https://www.simi.ie/en)
, you can make a formal complaint to SIMI through its [ consumer complaints
service or arbitration scheme ](https://www.simi.ie/en/consumer-
help/complaints-service) . SIMI will try to mediate between you and the trader
to resolve the issue.

SIMI deals with complaints relating to:

  * Used car you bought from SIMI members 
  * Service or repairs of cars by SIMI members 

Make your complaint to SIMI within 3 months from the date your problem
started. There is no charge for using the SIMI complaints or arbitration
services.

To check if the garage or car dealer is a member of SIMI, search the [ SIMI
directory ](https://www.simi.ie/en/find-a-member) or ring 01 6161690\. If a
dealer is a member of SIMI, they will have the current logo displayed on their
premises along with the current year of membership.

SIMI members have to follow the code of ethics and offer a high standard of
customer service. This includes doing checks on second-hand vehicles and
sorting out any issues that arise.
