##  Introduction

If you are aged 18 or over you can apply for an Age Card to prove that you
have reached the legal age when purchasing alcohol.

The Age Card includes the following information:

  * Your name 
  * Your date of birth 
  * A photograph of you 
  * Relevant security features (such as a metal hologram, embossed symbol or encoded magnetic stripe) 

The Age card is a proof of age card and is not an identity card. This card can
only be used to show you have reached the legal age for purchasing alcohol. It
should not be used for any other purpose.
