##  Changing or ending a restraining order

A court can change or end a civil restraining order after it is made if the
victim, the person under the civil restraining order, or a garda applies to
change or end the order.

If an application to change or end to a civil restraining order is made by the
victim, the person under the civil restraining order must be notified.

If an application to change or end to a civil restraining order is made by the
person under the civil restraining order, the victim must be notified.

If a garda intends to apply, they must notify both the victim and person under
the civil restraining order.

A court only varies or ends an order if it considers it necessary or
proportionate to do so.
