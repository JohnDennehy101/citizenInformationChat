##  Emergency temporary restraining orders

If you believe there is an immediate risk to your safety and welfare, you can
apply on an emergency basis for a temporary civil restraining order. An
emergency temporary restraining order application can be made without the
offending person being notified in advance.

A temporary civil restraining order lasts for a maximum of 8 days, but a court
may specify a shorter time period.
