###  **Proof of blindness or low vision**

To qualify for Blind Pension, your vision must be impaired to the point that:

  * You can’t carry out any job where eyesight is essential, or 
  * You can’t continue working in your regular occupation. 

If you're registered with [ Vision Ireland ](https://vi.ie/) , this is usually
accepted as proof of your blindness.

However, if you're not registered with Vision Ireland, you must provide the
Department of Social Protection with a medical report from an ophthalmic
surgeon or optometrist.
