###  **Partial Capacity Benefit**

If you were getting Illness Benefit and transferred to Partial Capacity
Benefit (PCB), your PCB is not taken into account in the means test for Blind
Pension. However, your earnings from employment are taken into account and may
affect the amount of Blind Pension you get.
