##  Rules

**Marriage Registration Form**

Whether you decide on a religious, secular or civil ceremony you will require
a Marriage Registration Form (MRF). You can get your MRF by giving [ 3 months’
notice of intention to marry ](/en/birth-family-relationships/getting-
married/notification-requirements-for-marriage/) to the registrar at a Civil
Registration Service. You should contact your local [ Civil Registration
Service ](https://www2.hse.ie/services/births-deaths-and-marriages/contact-a-
civil-registration-service.html) to make an appointment with the registrar.
You can also use the [ online booking system
](https://www2.hse.ie/services/births-deaths-and-marriages/getting-
married/book-appointment/) at [ crsappointments.ie
](http://www.crsappointments.ie/CeremonyPlanner.Ireland/) for some areas of
the country.

If you meet the 3 months’ notification requirements and there is no barrier to
you getting married (known as an _impediment_ to the marriage) the registrar
will issue you with an Marriage Registration Form (MRF) giving you permission
to marry. You should give the MRF to the person who will be solemnising the
marriage in advance of the marriage ceremony.
