##  Children and maintenance

Parents, whether married or not, must support their dependent children.

The [ Children and Family Relationships Act 2015
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2015/en/act/pub/0009/index.html) has amended
the [ Family Law (Maintenance of Spouses and Children) Act 1976
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1976/en/act/pub/0011/index.html) so that a
cohabitant who is a [ guardian ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/birth-
family-relationships/cohabiting-couples/guardianship-and-cohabiting-couples/)
of:

  * Their partnerâ€™s child, or 
  * The child their partner has the day-to-day care of 

has a financial responsibility to the child.

It allows for a court to order the cohabitant to pay maintenance to support a
dependent child who is under 18 years of age.

  * Is under 18 years old, or
