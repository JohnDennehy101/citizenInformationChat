##  Marital status and maintenance

If you are or have been married or in a civil partnership, you are entitled to
apply to the court for maintenance from your spouse/civil partner to cover
your own expenses.

If you are in a cohabiting relationship, you have no such right. If your
cohabiting relationship breaks down you may not apply to the court for
maintenance for yourself, unless you satisfy the eligibility criteria for the
[ Redress scheme for cohabiting couples ](/en/birth-family-
relationships/problems-in-marriages-and-other-relationships/redress-scheme-
for-cohabiting-couples/) . You will have to show that you were/are financially
dependent on your partner.
