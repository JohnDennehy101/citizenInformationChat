##  Witnesses

Witnesses are people who have been called to give [ evidence
](/en/justice/evidence/evidence-introduction/) in court. The witness's name is
called and they go into the witness box at one side of the judge. They stand
in the witness box to repeat the oath or affirmation and then sit down.

The witness is then asked a series of questions by the [ barristers
](/en/justice/courtroom/barristers/) (or [ solicitors
](/en/justice/courtroom/solicitors/) ) in the case. The witness's function is
to give evidence to the court. For example, the witness may have seen a
robbery take place and may be able to tell the court what they saw. This
evidence may help the [ judge ](/en/justice/courtroom/judge/) or the [ jury
](/en/justice/courtroom/jury/) to make its decision.
