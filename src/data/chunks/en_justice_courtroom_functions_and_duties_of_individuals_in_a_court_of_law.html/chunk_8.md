##  The court registrar

The court registrar (or court clerk) usually sits on a slightly raised
platform below the [ judge ](/en/justice/courtroom/judge/) facing the court.
They do not wear any special clothes in court, although sometimes in the High
Court if the registrar happens to also be a [ barrister
](/en/justice/courtroom/barristers/) , they will wear barrister's robes.

Court registrars are public servants and they are recruited directly from [
the civil service. ](/en/government-in-ireland/how-government-works/national-
government/the-civil-service/)

The registrar's main function is to assist the judge by:

  * Calling out each case as they start so that the parties can identify themselves to the court 
  * Swearing in the witnesses 
  * Swearing in the jury and recording the decision in the case 
  * Being in charge of court documents and exhibits 
  * Drafting the orders that the judge has made during a day in court and keeping a record of those orders 
  * Generally dealing with the administration necessary for the smooth running of the courts
