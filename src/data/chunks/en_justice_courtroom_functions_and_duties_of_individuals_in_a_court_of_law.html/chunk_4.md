##  Barristers

A barrister (also called "counsel") is a type of lawyer who specialises in
court advocacy and giving legal opinions. In court, their role is to argue
their case and examine any witnesses. They sit facing the judge and the
witnesses, and wear black gowns.

Barristers are engaged by solicitors to work on a case. When you contact a
solicitor for legal advice, your solicitor may recommend that a barrister be
engaged to provide services.
