###  PRSI refunds

If the wrong rate of PRSI is deducted from your wages you are entitled to a
refund. There are a number of reasons why you might be paying the wrong PRSI
rate.

To get a refund, either you or your employer should contact the Refunds
Section in the Department of Social Protection (DSP) - see 'Where to apply'
below. You will be sent a refund application form to fill out. If you have
paid too much PRSI, you will get a refund and the Department will correct your
social insurance record.
