###  People who cannot be sureties or bails-persons

A court should consider the suitability of a person who is proposed as a
surety, and the court can receive evidence about the financial resources of
the person, their character and previous convictions. They can be rejected if
it is clear that they could not pay the amount of money specified in the bail-
bond if it was breached.

The following people may not be accepted as bails-persons:

  * The accused's solicitor 
  * People under 18 years of age 
  * People in custody 
  * People with previous convictions 
  * People who have recently been declared bankrupt by order of the court
