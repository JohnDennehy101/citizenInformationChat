##  Introduction

If you are arrested and charged with an offence, you are presumed innocent
until proven guilty. Because you are presumed innocent, you can be released
from custody until your court date if you make a written commitment to appear
in court, this is called bail. You may have to lodge money as part of your
bail.

The court can refuse bail, if it believes that you are likely to commit an
offence while out on bail. If you are sent for trial in the [ Special Criminal
Court ](/en/justice/courts-system/special-criminal-court/) you cannot get bail
unless the Director of Public Prosecutions allows it.

If you are arrested and charged with an offence, you will be brought before a
[ District Court ](/en/justice/courts-system/district-court/) as soon as
possible. You can make an application in court to be released from custody on
_bail_ .
