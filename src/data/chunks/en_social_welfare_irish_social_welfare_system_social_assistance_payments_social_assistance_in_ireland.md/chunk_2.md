##  Introduction

Social assistance payments are for people who do not have enough [ PRSI
contributions ](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/social-
insurance-prsi/social-insurance/) to qualify for the equivalent social
insurance payments. An example would be a person who becomes unemployed,
applies for Jobseeker's Benefit but fails to qualify because he or she has
insufficient PRSI contributions. He or she can instead apply for Jobseeker's
Allowance, which is a similar payment but is not based on the number of PRSI
contributions paid. Jobseeker's Benefit is a social insurance payment but
Jobseeker's Allowance is a social assistance payment.

However, to get a social assistance payment you must be [ habitually resident
in Ireland ](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/social-assistance-
payments/habitual-residence-condition/) and you must pass a [ means test
](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/means-test-for-social-
welfare-payments/means-test/) .
