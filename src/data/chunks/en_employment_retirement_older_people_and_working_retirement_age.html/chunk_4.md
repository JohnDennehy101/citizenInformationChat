##  For jobs with a statutory retirement age

In some jobs, there is a _statutory retirement age_ . This means the
retirement age is set out in law.

For example:

  * Members of the Garda Síochána must retire by age 62. If they joined after 2004, they can choose to retire as early as age 55. 
  * Full-time members of the Fire Service and retained firefighters must retire by age 62.
