##  Retirement age for the self-employed and others

There is no set retirement age for self-employed people.

There is no general age limit for company directors, but sometimes the
company's articles of association may set an upper age limit.

General practitioners (GPs) must retire from the General Medical Services
scheme at age 72. However, they can continue in private practice if they meet
the ‘fitness to practise’ criteria set by the Medical Council.
