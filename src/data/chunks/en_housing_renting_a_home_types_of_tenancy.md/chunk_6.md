##  Tenancies of unlimited duration

You automatically get security of tenure and can stay in your rented property
indefinitely if all of the following apply:

  * Your tenancy was created after 10 June 2022 
  * You have been renting for at least 6 months 
  * You haven't been served with a valid written notice of termination 

This is known as a tenancy of unlimited duration.

If your tenancy was created before 11 June 2022, the previous security of
tenure rules apply until the current 6-year cycle of the tenancy ends. If the
landlord does not terminate the tenancy under the old rules, your tenancy will
automatically become a tenancy of unlimited duration after 6 years. See [ Part
4 and further Part 4 tenancies ](/en/housing/renting-a-home/types-of-
tenancy#l7ed96) below for details about the old rules.

If the old rules apply to your tenancy, you can switch to a tenancy of
unlimited duration if your landlord agrees.
