###  Claiming a Part 4 tenancy at the end of a fixed-term lease

If you have a fixed-term contract or lease and you want to remain in the
property under a Part 4 tenancy, you should notify your landlord of your
intention to stay in the property. You should do this between 3 months and 1
month before your fixedâ€“term tenancy or lease agreement expires.

If you do not notify your landlord, you cannot be refused coverage under Part
4, but you may have to compensate the landlord for any financial loss that
they have because you did not notify them of your intention to remain in the
tenancy.
