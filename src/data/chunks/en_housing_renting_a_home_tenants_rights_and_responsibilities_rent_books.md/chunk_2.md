##  What is a rent book?

A rent book is a document used by your landlord to keep details about your
tenancy and record all the rent payments you make.

You keep the rent book. But, you should make it available to your landlord, so
they can make changes and record your rent and other payments.

Rent books are usually small booklets, but they can come in other forms, as
long as they contain all the [ necessary information

Even if you have a rent book, you should keep your own written records of the
payments you make to your landlord as well as the receipts given to you, as
proof of payments you've made.
