If after the interview the [ IPO decides that it canâ€™t accept your application
](/en/moving-country/asylum-seekers-and-refugees/the-asylum-process-in-
ireland/how-refugee-applications-commissioner-deals-with-applications/) ,
because it is _inadmissible_ , it will write to tell you why. You could have
been granted international protection in another EU country or you could come
from a country which is deemed to pose no risk.

You can [ appeal ](/en/moving-country/asylum-seekers-and-refugees/the-asylum-
process-in-ireland/if-your-application-for-refugee-status-is-refused/) this
decision in writing to the [ International Protection Appeals Tribunal (IPAT
](http://www.protectionappeals.ie/) ) in Dublin. You need to do this within 10
working days of the date of notification of the refusal. An extension to the
10 day limit can be granted if there is good reason for the delay.
