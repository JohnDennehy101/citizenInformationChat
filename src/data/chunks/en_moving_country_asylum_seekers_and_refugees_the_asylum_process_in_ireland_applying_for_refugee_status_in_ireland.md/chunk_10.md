##  Step 3: Complete questionnaire

If the IPO accepts your application, you can stay in Ireland while it is being
processed. The International Protection Accommodation Service (IPAS) will
offer you somewhere to live. This is called [ direct provision ](/en/moving-
country/asylum-seekers-and-refugees/services-for-asylum-seekers-in-
ireland/direct-provision/) . You [ cannot work ](/en/moving-country/asylum-
seekers-and-refugees/the-asylum-process-in-ireland/rights-and-obligations-of-
asylum-seekers-in-ireland/) or open a business. But if the IPO has not made a
decision on your application within 5 months , you can apply for [ permission
to work ](https://www.irishimmigration.ie/my-situation-has-changed-since-i-
arrived-in-ireland/labour-market-access-permission/) .

The IPO will give you an Application for [ International Protection
Questionnaire ](http://ipo.gov.ie/en/IPO/Pages/IPO_Questionnaire_IPO_2) to
fill in. The questionnaire is available in a number of different languages. If
you do not know how to fill it in, you should get legal advice, or you can ask
one of the organisations listed in ‘Organisations that can help’ below.

You can [ apply for legal aid ](/en/moving-country/asylum-seekers-and-
refugees/services-for-asylum-seekers-in-ireland/legal-aid-for-asylum-seekers-
in-ireland/) through the Legal Aid Board.

You should also send documents and evidence to support your application. You
can send anything that you think will support your application. If you are not
sure what to send, you should get legal advice.

You will also get a Temporary Registration Certificate (TRC). This is proof
that you have made an application for asylum in Ireland.
