###  If you can’t go to the interview

If you can’t go to your interview on the set date, you should inform the IPO
as soon as possible after you receive your interview date. You also need to
tell them why you cannot go to the interview and send proof of this reason.

Example: If you are ill, you might send a letter from your doctor on headed
paper to say that you would not be fit enough to be interviewed on that date.
