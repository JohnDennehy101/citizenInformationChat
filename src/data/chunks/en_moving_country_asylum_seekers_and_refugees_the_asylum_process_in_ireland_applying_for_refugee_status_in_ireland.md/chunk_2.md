##  Introduction

You can apply for international protection in Ireland if you have come to
Ireland to escape persecution in your own country.

You can also apply for international protection if you cannot return to your
country because you have a well-founded fear for your safety.

Most people apply for international protection when they enter Ireland. This
is also called claiming asylum. You can also apply if you are already in
Ireland.

Some people come to Ireland as _programme refugees_ . This means that the
Irish Government has decided to allow them to live in Ireland following a
request by the [ United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees
](https://www.unhcr.org/en-ie/) .
