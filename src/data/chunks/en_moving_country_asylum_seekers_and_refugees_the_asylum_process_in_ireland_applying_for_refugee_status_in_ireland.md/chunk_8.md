##  Step 2: Take part in a preliminary interview

When you say that you want to claim international protection or asylum, an IPO
officer will interview you. This is called the _preliminary interview_ .
During this interview, you will be asked about:

  * Your identity 
  * Your country of origin 
  * How you came to Ireland 
  * The reasons why you cannot return to your country of origin 
  * Your immigration history in Ireland if you have any 

The IPO takes your photograph and fingerprints. It shares this information
with [ EURODAC ](/en/moving-country/asylum-seekers-and-refugees/the-asylum-
process-in-ireland/eurodac-system/) â€“ this is a computer database that
compares fingerprints. If you have already claimed asylum in another country
in the EU, the IPO may decide to return you to that country.
