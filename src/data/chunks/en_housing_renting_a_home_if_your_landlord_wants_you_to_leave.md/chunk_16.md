###  If your landlord is substantially refurbishing the property

A tenancy can only be ended for this reason if the proposed works are
substantial and mean that the property will have to be vacated. They must
state the nature of the works in writing, along with the notice of
termination. They must state:

  * If planning permission is needed 
  * The name of the contractor (if any) 
  * The dates the intended works are to be carried out 
  * The proposed duration of the works 

They must also include a certificate from a registered professional stating
that:

  * The works would be a health and safety risk to the occupants 
  * The property should be vacated while the works are being completed 
  * The length of time the property should be vacated in order to complete the works (this must be longer than 3 weeks)
