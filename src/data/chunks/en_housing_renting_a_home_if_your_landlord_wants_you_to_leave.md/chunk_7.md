###  Landlordsâ€™ right to end certain tenancies after 6 years

If your tenancy was created before 11 June 2022, your landlord can terminate
your tenancy for any reason when you have rented for 6 years. The landlord
must:

  * Serve a notice of termination before the end of the 6 years, and 
  * Give a notice period that expires on or after the end of the tenancy 

If the tenancy is not ended after 6 years, a new tenancy will begin. This new
tenancy will be a tenancy of unlimited duration and the above exception will
no longer apply.

By June 2028, all tenancies will be tenancies of unlimited duration and the
above exception will no longer apply. This is because all existing 6-year
cycle tenancies will have ended by then.
