###  If the property is being sold

If your landlord intends to sell the property within 9 months of the
terminating your tenancy, the notice of termination must state that:

“The reason for the termination of the tenancy is due to the fact that the
landlord intends to sell the dwelling, for full consideration, within 9 months
after the termination of the tenancy”.

The landlord must enter into a contract for sale within 9 months of the
termination date. The notice must also include a statutory declaration stating
the landlord’s intention to sell.

If the landlord is terminating a tenancy of more than 6 months based on the
‘Tyrrelstown’ amendment (see above), the statutory declaration must also state
that:

  * The market value with a sitting tenant is over 20% below the market value with vacant possession, and 
  * Preventing them from terminating the tenancy would be unduly onerous on them or would cause them undue hardship

_Landlord_intends_to_sell_0612-23.docx) contains the required information and
a sample statutory declaration.

If your landlord ends your tenancy because they are selling the property and
it becomes available for rent again, the landlord must offer it back to you
within 12 months of the expiry of your notice period.
