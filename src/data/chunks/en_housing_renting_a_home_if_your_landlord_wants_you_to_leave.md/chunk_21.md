###  Minor errors in a notice of termination

When dealing with a [ dispute ](/en/housing/renting-a-home/resolving-
disputes/disputes-between-landlords-and-tenants/) about a notice of
termination, an adjudicator (or the Tenancy Tribunal) can overlook a minor
error or omission in a notice of termination. They can do this if the error
does not prejudice the notice of termination and the notice would otherwise be
valid. This is known as the ‘slip rule’ and it is set-out in [ Section 30
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2015/act/42/enacted/en/print#sec30) of
the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2015

A ‘remedial notice’ can be issued that fixes the error with the original
notice. For more information on [ remedial notices see the RTB’s website

termination) .
