####  Student accommodation

There will be new support from the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund (ISIF)
for investment in student accommodation. Higher education Institutions will
also be able to access **low-cost loan finance** from the Housing Finance
Agency.

It is intended that the increase of â‚¬2,000 in the ceiling for **Rent-a-room
relief** will help to increase the supply of accommodation for students.
