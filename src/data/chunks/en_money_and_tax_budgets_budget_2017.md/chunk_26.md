###  Housing

A total of €1.2 billion is allocated to the Department of Housing, Planning,
Community and Local Government for Housing in 2017. This will allow for
continued implementation of the Housing Action Plan. Under the Plan, it is
intended that 47,000 new social housing units will be delivered by 2021.

The total includes an Exchequer allocation of €50 million for the €200 million
**Local Infrastructure Housing Activation Fund** , to accelerate the provision
of public infrastructure to support the development of sites for private
housing in urban areas. It is hoped that this fund will facilitate the
delivery of up to 20,000 private houses by 2019.

In addition, local authorities will use €92 million from surplus Local
Property Tax receipts to fund a range of housing services.
