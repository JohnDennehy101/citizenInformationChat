####  **Parents are living apart**

DCA may be paid where parents share the full-time care of their disabled
child, but live apart. For example, where separated parents have joint
custody, but the child doesnâ€™t live with either parent for the required 5
continuous days each week.

In this case, DCA is paid to the parent who is nominated in writing by both
parents, or to the parent who is getting Child Benefit for the child.
