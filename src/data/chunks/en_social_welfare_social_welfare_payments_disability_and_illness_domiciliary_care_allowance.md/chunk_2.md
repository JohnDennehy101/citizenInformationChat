##  What is the Domiciliary Care Allowance?

Domiciliary Care Allowance (DCA) is a monthly payment for a child aged under
16 with a _severe_ disability.

DCA is not means-tested, so you may qualify for it regardless of your income.

DCA is not based on the type of disability your child has. Instead, it is
based on their level of physical or mental impairment. Your child must need
ongoing care and attention, _substantially_ over and above what is usually
needed by a child of the same age.

You can read more about what _severe_ or _substantially_ means in the [ DCA
Medical Guidelines (pdf)
](https://assets.gov.ie/37034/fdb0f1b14efd46d894d807c136128fdc.pdf) . The
Department of Social Protection (DSP) uses these guidelines when assessing
applications for DCA.
