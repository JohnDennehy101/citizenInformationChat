###  Finding a Peace Commissioner

The Department of Justice maintains the Roll of Peace Commissioners, however,
it may not be fully up to date. The Department can usually provide the name
and address of a Peace Commissioner on request - see 'Where to apply' below.

Your [ local Garda (police) station ](https://www.garda.ie/en/contact-
us/station-directory/) may also be able to give you the name and address of a
Peace Commissioner.
