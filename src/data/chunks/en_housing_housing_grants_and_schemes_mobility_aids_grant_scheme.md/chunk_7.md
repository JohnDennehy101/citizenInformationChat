###  **Does my home qualify?**

Your home qualifies if it is:

  * Privately owned (you or your family own it) 
  * Rented from a landlord and you have the landlordâ€™s permission to make the changes. (The tenancy must also be registered with the Residential Tenancies Board). 
  * Provided by an approved housing body (AHB) 
  * A communal residence (accommodation where people live together in group homes) 

You must live in the property as your primary home when the work is completed.

Your tax affairs and Local Property Tax must also be in order to qualify for
the grant.
