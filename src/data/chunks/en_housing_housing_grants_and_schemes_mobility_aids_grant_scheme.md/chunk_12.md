the [ local authorityâ€™s ](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/942f74-local-
authorities/) decision, you can appeal the decision. You must appeal to the
local authority in writing within 3 weeks of the decision, explaining why you
are appealing. Someone in the local authority who was not involved in the
original assessment will assess your appeal and contact you with a result.
