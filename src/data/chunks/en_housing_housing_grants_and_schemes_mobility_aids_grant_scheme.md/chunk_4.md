##  How much is the grant?

The maximum grant you can get is â‚¬6,000, which may cover 100% of the cost of
the works. However, you may not get the maximum grant. This is because the
grant is paid by your [ local authority
](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/942f74-local-authorities/) , and is
dependent on what funding they have available. They will decide whether they
can pay you the full grant, or a percentage of the grant.
