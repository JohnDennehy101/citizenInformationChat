###  Serious road traffic collisions

When a serious road traffic collision occurs, causing a serious or fatal
injury, there will be an investigation by the Garda√≠ and possibly the [
coroner ](/en/death/sudden-or-unexplained-death/coroners/) . It may involve an
[ inquest ](/en/death/sudden-or-unexplained-death/inquests-and-inquest-
reports/) and even a [ criminal prosecution ](/en/justice/criminal-
law/criminal-trial/criminal-trial/) .

PARC Road Safety Group has published [ Finding Your Way (pdf)
](https://www.garda.ie/en/victim-services/where-else-can-i-get-
support-/finding-your-way-a-guide-for-families-of-victims-of-road-traffic-
collisions.pdf) . It is a guide for victims where the driver suspected of
having caused a fatal or serious injury collision has survived and may face
criminal prosecution.
