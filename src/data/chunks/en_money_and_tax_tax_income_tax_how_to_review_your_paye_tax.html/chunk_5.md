##  How do I get a final Statement of Liability?

The Statement of Liability is a final review of your tax liability for a tax
year. It was previously known as the P21â€“End of Year Statement.

You must complete an income tax return to request your Statement of Liability.

By completing an income tax return you can:

  * Change existing tax credits or declared income 
  * Declare additional income, for example rental income or income from casual work 
  * Claim additional credits or reliefs, for example [ medical expenses ](/en/money-and-tax/tax/income-tax-credits-and-reliefs/taxation-and-medical-expenses/)

You can use your Statement of Liability in the same way as the P21, for
example, as proof of income.
