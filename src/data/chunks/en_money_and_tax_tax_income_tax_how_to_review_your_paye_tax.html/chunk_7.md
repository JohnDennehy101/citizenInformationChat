####  Is there a time limit for when I can request my Statement of Liability
for a particular tax year?

You can get your Statement of Liability for the last 4 years (you can only
claim a refund of overpaid tax for the last 4 years). In 2024, you can request
a Statement of Liability for the years 2020, 2021, 2022 and 2023.
