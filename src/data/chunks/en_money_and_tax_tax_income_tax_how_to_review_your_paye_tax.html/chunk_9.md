##  What if I am not registered for myAccount?

You can get a paper version of your **Statement of Liability** if you complete
a paper [ Form 12 (pdf) ](http://www.revenue.ie/en/tax/it/forms/form12.pdf) or
[ Form 12S (pdf) ](https://www.revenue.ie/en/self-assessment-and-self-
employment/documents/form-12s.pdf) (a simplified version for routine tax
returns) and return to your local tax office.

Unless you are exempt from using Revenueâ€™s online services, you must register
with myAccount to access your **Employment Detail Summary** and **Preliminary
End of Year Statement** .

If you have been granted an exemption, you can access your documents as
follows:

  * **Employment Detail Summary:** Contact your [ local tax office ](https://www.revenue.ie/en/contact-us/index.aspx) by phone or in writing and request your Employment Detail Summary. A printout will be posted to your home address. 
  * **Preliminary End of Year Statement:** Your Preliminary End of Year Statement will not be available to you as a printout. You can contact your local tax office who can advise you of your position (for example, a tax overpayment or underpayment) over the phone.
