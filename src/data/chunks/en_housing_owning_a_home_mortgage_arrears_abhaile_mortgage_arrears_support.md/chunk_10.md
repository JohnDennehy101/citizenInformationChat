###  Personal insolvency court review service

If you have already worked with a PIP and have proposed a [ Personal
Insolvency Arrangement (PIA) ](/en/money-and-tax/personal-
finance/debt/personal-insolvency/personal-insolvency-arrangements/) to your
creditors, but the creditors have refused your proposal, you can ask the
Courts to review it.

The Legal Aid Board can provide you with legal representation when looking for
a Court review of your PIA proposal. If the Court agrees that the proposal is
overall fair and reasonable, using the criteria set out in [ section 115A of
the Personal Insolvency Act 2012
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2015/act/32/section/21/enacted/en/html#sec21)
, it can impose the proposal on your creditors.

Your PIP will apply to the Legal Aid Board for legal representation on your
behalf. The PIP must certify to the Board that you have reasonable grounds for
seeking the court review and that you satisfy the other conditions for review
laid down by the [ Personal Insolvency Acts 2012 to 2015 (pdf)
](http://www.lawreform.ie/_fileupload/RevisedActs/WithAnnotations/en_act_2012_0044.PDF)
.

If the Legal Aid Board is satisfied with the application, it will grant you a
Legal Aid Certificate. You and your PIP can then select a solicitor from the
Abhaile scheme solicitors’ panel to act on your behalf. (Under the Personal
Insolvency Acts, it is your PIP who must apply to Court on your behalf for the
review.) The Legal Aid Board will normally also cover the cost of a barrister
from the Civil Legal Aid barristers’ panel.
