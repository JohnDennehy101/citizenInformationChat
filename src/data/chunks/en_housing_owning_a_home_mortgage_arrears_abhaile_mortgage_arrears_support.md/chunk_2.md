##  What is the Abhaile scheme?

If you are in serious mortgage arrears on your home, if you are unable to pay
your debts, and if your mortgage lender has begun to take legal action, you
may be able to access the [ Abhaile scheme ](https://www.mabs.ie/en/abhaile)
for borrowers in home mortgage arrears. This scheme provides a range of
services to help you to deal with your situation, including financial advice,
legal advice and insolvency advice.

Abhaile is coordinated by the [ Department of Justice and Equality
](http://www.justice.ie/en/JELR/Pages/home) and the [ Department of Employment
Affairs and Social Protection ](http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/home.aspx) . It
is operated by the [ Money Advice and Budgeting Service (MABS)
](https://www.mabs.ie/) together with the [ Insolvency Service of Ireland
(ISI) ](http://www.isi.gov.ie/en/ISI/Pages/Home) , the [ Legal Aid Board
](http://www.legalaidboard.ie/en/) and the [ Citizens Information Board
](http://www.citizensinformationboard.ie/en/) .

Panels of qualified and regulated professionals provide services under the
