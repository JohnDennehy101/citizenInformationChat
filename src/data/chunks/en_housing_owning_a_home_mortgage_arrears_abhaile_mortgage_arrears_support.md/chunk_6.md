###  Personal Insolvency Practitioner (PIP) service

The Abhaile scheme has a [ panel of Personal Insolvency Practitioners (pdf)
](http://www.isi.gov.ie/en/ISI/Aid_and_Advice_PIP_Panel.pdf/Files/Aid_and_Advice_PIP_Panel.pdf)
. If you want to explore your [ options under personal insolvency ](/en/money-
and-tax/personal-finance/debt/personal-insolvency/personal-insolvency-
options/) , MABS can give you a voucher for free advice and help from one of
these PIPs. You can choose your PIP from the Abhaile scheme panel, subject to
availability.

The voucher gets you to a face-to-face consultation with a PIP. The PIP will:

  * Complete a full assessment of your financial situation 
  * Explain all the available options on how to deal with your mortgage arrears 
  * Advise you of the best option for how to deal with your mortgage arrears and confirm that advice in writing 
  * Prepare a Prescribed Financial Statement (PFS) with you. This is a detailed written analysis of your financial situation, as required under the personal insolvency legislation. 

If the PIP advises that your best option is personal insolvency, they will
help you with the next steps. If they advise that your best option is [
bankruptcy ](/en/money-and-tax/personal-finance/debt/personal-insolvency/what-
is-bankruptcy/) , they will give you a certificate confirming that you have
been advised about your options under personal insolvency. This certificate is
required by the bankruptcy court.

You qualify for the Personal Insolvency Court Review Service under the Abhaile
scheme if you are insolvent and in mortgage arrears and your creditors have
rejected your proposal for a [ Personal Insolvency Arrangement (PIA)
](/en/money-and-tax/personal-finance/debt/personal-insolvency/personal-
insolvency-arrangements/) that included your home. See below for more
information on the Personal Insolvency Court Review Service.
