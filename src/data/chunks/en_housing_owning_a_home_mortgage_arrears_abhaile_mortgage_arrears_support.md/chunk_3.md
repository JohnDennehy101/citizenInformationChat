##  Who qualifies for Abhaile?

You will be eligible for advice and assistance under the Abhaile scheme if:

  * You are insolvent â€“ this means that you are unable to pay your debts in full as they fall due 
  * You are in mortgage arrears on your home 
  * You are at risk of losing your home. For example, if your mortgage lender has started repossession proceedings or indicated that they plan to do so, if they have said that they consider you to be non-cooperating, or if they have asked you to consider selling or surrendering your home. 

However, even if the above conditions are satisfied, you will not qualify for
the Abhaile scheme if your home is not in proportion to your reasonable living
accommodation needs, as set out at [ section 104 of the Personal Insolvency
Act 2012
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2012/act/44/section/104/enacted/en/html#sec104)
.

If your mortgage arrears are for a buy-to-let property, you are not covered by
the Abhaile scheme. However, if you are in mortgage arrears on your home, and
you also own a buy-to-let, you will qualify if you meet the conditions above.

Eligibility is reviewed on a case-by-case basis. You should contact MABS to
check if you qualify for Abhaile.
