###  Accountant service

If your case involves complicated financial issues, but is not suited to
personal insolvency, MABS can give you a voucher for free financial advice
from an accountant. The Abhaile scheme has an [ accountancy panel
](http://www.keepingyourhome.ie/abhaile_accountants/) , listing accountants
who participate in the scheme. You can choose your accountant from this panel,
subject to availability.

You will first need to work with a MABS adviser to complete the Standard
Financial Statement (SFS) that lenders need under the [ Mortgage Arrears
Resolution Process (MARP) ](/en/housing/owning-a-home/mortgage-
arrears/mortgage-arrears-resolution-process/) . The accountant will need a
copy of this statement in order to give you financial advice.

The voucher gets you to a face-to-face consultation with the panel accountant.
The accountant will:

  * Advise you on any financial issues relating to resolution of your mortgage arrears 
  * Advise you on possible solutions 
  * Confirm that advice to you in writing
