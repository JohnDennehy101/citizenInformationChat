####  What happens to the balance in my old account?

The balance in your old account will be transferred to your new account as
part of the switching process.

You may need to leave enough money in your old account to cover any fees that
you owe, or to cover any payments that are due to be taken.

Once the switch is completed, your old bank will send you a closing statement.
