##  How do I choose a new bank?

When choosing a current account think about how you use your current account
and the features you use.

  * **Review your banking habits** . Check back over your records and count how many times you make each type of transaction: 
    * Cash withdrawals 
    * Bill payments 
    * Debit card purchases 
    * Contactless payments 
    * Money transfers 
    * In-branch cashier transactions 
    * Non-EU transactions 
  * **Know how you make your transactions** . Check whether you make most banking transactions using ATMs, online or in-branch. 
  * **Decide how you want to deal with your bank** . You might like dealing with a person in a branch, so choosing a bank you can easily get to will be important. If you prefer the convenience of internet and mobile banking, you should make sure you are happy with the online and mobile services provided. 

Make sure you understand all the terms, conditions and fees of the account
before you sign up. You can check the Competition and Consumer Protection
Commission (CCPC) [ jargon buster
](https://www.ccpc.ie/consumers/money/jargon-buster/) for terms that you do
not understand.

other details.
