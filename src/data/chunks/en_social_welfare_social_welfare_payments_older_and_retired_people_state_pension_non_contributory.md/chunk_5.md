###  **Cash income**

The DSP looks at any cash income that you and your spouse, civil partner, or
cohabitant may have. For example, pensions from another country or income from
employment.

You can earn up to €200 per week from employment, and it won’t affect your
pension. However, this does not include self-employment or farming. Your
spouse, civil partner or cohabitant can also earn up to €200 per week. If
either of you have income from employment above this amount, it is assessed in
the means test.
