####  **Farming or leasing your land**

If you are farming or leasing your land, your net income is assessed in the
means test.

Your net income is worked out by taking your gross income (your income before
tax), and deducting your expenses.

If you own land that is not productively used or leased, the DSP assesses it
on its _capital value_ instead (see ‘Capital’ below).
