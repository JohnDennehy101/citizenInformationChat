####  **How capital is assessed for State Pension (Non-Contributory)**

The Department of Social Protection (DSP) adds all your capital from different
sources together, and then uses the following formula to [ find your weekly
means from capital: ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-
welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/means-test-for-social-welfare-
payments/how-to-assess-your-means-from-capital-for-social-welfare-payments/)

**Your capital** |  **Weekly means assessed**  
---|---  
First €20,000  |  Nil   
Next €10,000  |  €1 per €1,000   
Next €10,000  |  €2 per €1,000   
Balance  |  €4 per €1,000   
  
If your property is assessed on its capital value, then income from that
property (such as rent) is not assessed in the means test.

If you or your spouse, civil partner, or cohabitant saves a portion of your
State Pension (Non-Contributory) each week, these savings will be assessed as
capital.
