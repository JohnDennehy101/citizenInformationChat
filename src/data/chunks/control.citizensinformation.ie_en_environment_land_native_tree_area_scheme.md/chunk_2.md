##  What is the Native Tree Area Scheme?

The Native Tree Area Scheme allows people to plant small areas of native
forest on their land without having to get an afforestation licence.

You can plant trees on areas of land that are between 0.1 and 1 hectare. The
maximum amount of forestry you can plant altogether on your farm for this
scheme is 2 hectares.

The scheme aims to increase areas of native forestry in Ireland. Forests
created as part of this scheme are [ legally protected
](https://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2014/act/31/enacted/en/html) from
felling. This means when the scheme is over, you can’t cut them down without a
felling licence.

You can plant the trees yourself, but you should use a registered forester to
help you with your application form. See, ‘ [ How do I apply?
](https://control.citizensinformation.ie/en/environment/land/native-tree-area-
scheme/#0b360a) ’ below.

If you are accepted on the scheme, the payments continue for 10 years.
