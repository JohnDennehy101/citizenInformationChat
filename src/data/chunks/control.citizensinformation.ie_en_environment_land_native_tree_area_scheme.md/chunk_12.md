##  Where can I plant trees?

You should get the area you want to plant assessed by a registered forester to
make sure that it is suitable for planting.

You must have a minimum tree spacing of 3x3 metres, which will give a planting
density of 1,100 trees per hectare. (This will be different if you need to
have deer shelters.)

The area you plant must be protected from grazing. This means animals must be
fenced off from the area.

You must also keep the site free of invasive species, such as rhododendron.
Areas that are heavily infested with invasive species are not suitable for the
scheme.

**Planting on previously farmed land**

If you are planting on previously farmed land under the NTA 2 option, there
more rules about where you can plant trees.

  * You must have a 10-13 metre water set-back area where less than 20% of the area is planted with trees and no tree is within 2 metres of the water 
  * You must put a fence 2 metres from the outer row of trees on the side of the forest which is facing inland. No fence is allowed on the side of the forest facing the water. 
  * You cannot use herbicides in the water set-back area
