##  What trees can I plant?

All tree species planted as part of the scheme must be native to Ireland.

The types of trees you can plant depend on the type of soil you have,
seebelow. A registered forester will help you to decide which option suits
your land best.

**Scenario** |  **Planting mixture**  
---|---  
**Scenario 1** : Dry Mineral Soil  For example, podzols, brown podzols or brown earths  |  · 30% Oak - to be planted in predominantly pure groups  · 30% Birch - scattered intimately throughout with the remainder to be planted in pure groups  · 25% Scots pine - to be planted in small pure groups, focusing on parts of the plot and away from any watercourses adjoining or crossing the plot  · 15% other native species (see list below)  Changes of + or – 25% for each species will be accepted. A maximum of 25% Scots pine may be planted.   
**Scenario 2** : Wet Mineral Soil  For example, gleys  |  · 50% Alder - to be planted in pure groups (30-40 trees), with groups of Alder and Birch interspersed alternately  · 30% Birch - to be planted in pure groups (30-40 trees), with groups of Alder and Birch interspersed alternately  · 15% Oak - to be planted in small pure groups, focusing on the dryer parts of the plot  · 5% other native species (see list below)  Changes of + or – 25% for each species will be accepted.
