###  Tax and PRSI

If you are on low pay you may not be liable to pay any tax because your [ tax
credits and reliefs ](/en/money-and-tax/tax/income-tax-credits-and-
reliefs/introduction-to-income-tax-credits-and-reliefs/) are more than or
equal to the amount of tax you are due to pay. People with an income below
€13,000 do not pay the [ Universal Social Charge (USC) ](/en/money-and-
tax/tax/income-tax/universal-social-charge/) .

People aged 65 and over are subject to the same general tax rules as everyone
else but they do get tax exemption limits below which they pay no tax and some
extra tax credits. Revenue's information leaflet [ Tax Exemption and Marginal
Relief (IT 8) (pdf) ](https://www.revenue.ie/en/tax-professionals/tdm/income-
tax-capital-gains-tax-corporation-tax/part-07/07-01-18.pdf) gives information
on available exemption limits and tax relief.

If you have overpaid income tax or Universal Social Charge, then you can [
claim a tax refund ](/en/money-and-tax/tax/income-tax/tax-refund-when-
unemployed-or-out-of-work-sick/) . Further information about tax is also
available from [ Revenue ](http://www.revenue.ie/cont_main.htm) .

If you earn between €38 and €352 you do not have to pay [ PRSI ](/en/social-
welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/social-insurance-prsi/social-insurance/) .
However, your employer pays PRSI. More information can be found in our
document about your [ employer's duty to pay social insurance ](/en/social-
welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/social-insurance-prsi/paying-social-
insurance/) .
