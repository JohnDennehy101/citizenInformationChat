###  **Firearm certificate refusal**

You may be refused a firearm certificate if:

  * Your application does not establish a good reason for having one 
  * You are considered to be a danger to public safety or security 
  * You cannot show that you will keep the firearm securely 

If your firearm certificate is refused, the Garda√≠ will give you the reasons.
You can appeal a firearm certificate refusal to the District Court.
