###  **Firearm certificates**

It is a criminal offence to possess or use a firearm without a relevant
firearm certificate.

You do not need a firearms certificate if you fall into an exempted category,
for example, if you:

  * Use a firearm in the course of duty as a member of the Defence Forces or An Garda Síochána 
  * Use a firearm for certain sporting purposes 
  * Are a registered firearms dealer 

A firearm certificate lasts for 3 years.
