###  **Imitation (fake) firearms**

A realistic imitation (fake) firearm looks like a firearm but does not have
the necessary firing ability to be considered a firearm, for example,
paintball guns may be in this category.

If you have a realistic imitation firearm in a public place without lawful
authority or reasonable excuse, it is also a criminal offence.
