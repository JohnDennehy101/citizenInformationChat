###  **Applying for a firearms certificate if you are visiting Ireland**

If you are over 16 and not living in Ireland (not ordinarily resident) you can
get a 1-year non-resident firearms certificate. This will allow you legally to
own and use a firearm in Ireland for 12 months from the date you are granted
the firearms certificate. You must apply at least 6 weeks before your arrival.

You apply by filling in a [ Firearm Certificate Application (non-resident)
application form (pdf) ](https://www.garda.ie/en/about-us/online-
services/firearms-licensing/non-resident-form-amended-16-1-13.pdf) available
on the website of the Irish police force (An Garda Síochána).

You need to include:

  * Your personal information 
  * Details of your firearm 
  * Your travel details 
  * Location of and type of shooting you are planning 

You send your application to the [ Garda Superintendent of the district
](https://www.garda.ie/en/contact-us/station-directory/) where you plan to
first use the firearm along with:

  * A €40 application fee 
  * Your valid membership card of any Irish gun club, game association, and so on, (if you have a membership) 
  * A European Firearms Pass (EFP) (for residents of EU member states) 
  * Any other permit, licence or authorisation (if you are from another state) 

If you are applying to use a restricted firearm, your application will be sent
to the Garda chief superintendent of that division.
