###  Renewing your firearm certificate

When your firearm certificate is about to expire (after 3 years), you should
get a copy of a firearm renewal form from the Garda√≠. This will usually
contain your details and the existing details of the firearm. You can amend
the form if there are any changes to these details or if any information is
incorrect. You must then send the completed form to your local garda station.

If you do not get a firearm renewal form, you should contact your local garda
station to avoid holding an unlicensed firearm.

If everything is in order, you get a grant notice letter. This confirms that
your firearm certificate will be renewed for another 3 years once you pay the
fee.
