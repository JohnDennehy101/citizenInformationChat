##  Introduction

Voluntary work is a good way to keep active, learn new skills and get involved
in your local community. You can do some unpaid work as a volunteer and keep
your social welfare payment. However, you must continue to meet all the
conditions attached to your payment.

Your Intreo Centre or Social Welfare Branch Office or the section paying your
social welfare payment will usually decide whether you can keep your social
welfare payment and work as a volunteer.
