##  Jobseeker’s payments and volunteering

To get [ Jobseeker's Allowance ](/en/social-welfare/unemployed-
people/jobseekers-allowance/) or [ Jobseeker's Benefit ](/en/social-
welfare/unemployed-people/jobseekers-benefit/) you must be available and
looking for work. If you want to do voluntary work, you must first get
permission from a Deciding Officer at your Intreo Centre or Social Welfare
Branch Office. You must continue to satisfy the [ conditions of your
jobseeker’s payment ](/en/social-welfare/unemployed-people/rules-for-getting-
a-jobseekers-payment/) .

The Deciding Officer considers a number of factors when deciding if the work
involved is voluntary.

These include:

  * The aims and standing of the voluntary organisation (they can be national or local voluntary groups) 
  * The type of work involved 
  * The weekly number of hours worked. 

Examples of unpaid voluntary work a jobseeker can do include assisting youth
clubs, care groups, sports groups, and local residents associations.

If you want to do voluntary work and continue to get Jobseeker’s Allowance or
Jobseeker’s Benefit, you must apply under the voluntary work option before you
start any voluntary work. To apply, fill in [ application form (VW1)
](https://www.gov.ie/en/form/8cae6-voluntary-work-jobseeker-application-form-
vw1/) , which is available from your [ Intreo Centre or Social Welfare Branch
Office ](https://www.gov.ie/en/directory/category/e1f4b5-intreo-offices/) .
