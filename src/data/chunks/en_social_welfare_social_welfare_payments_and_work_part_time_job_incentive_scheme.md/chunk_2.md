##  Introduction

The Part-Time Job Incentive (PTJI) Scheme allows certain people getting
Jobseeker’s Allowance (JA) to take up part-time work and get a special weekly
allowance instead of their jobseeker’s payment. It is intended to be a
stepping stone to full-time work. You must be available for and seeking full-
time work while you are on the Part-Time Job Incentive Scheme.
