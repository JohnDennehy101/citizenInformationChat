###  Appeals

The Part-Time Job Incentive scheme is a non-statutory scheme and you cannot
appeal a decision to the Social Welfare Appeals Office. If you are not happy
with a decision on the scheme you can appeal to the Officer in charge of the
Part-Time Job Incentive Scheme at your local Intreo Centre or Social Welfare
Branch Office.
