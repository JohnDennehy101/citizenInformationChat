##  How to apply

Once you have secured the part-time job, you should contact your [ Intreo
Centre or local Social Welfare Branch Office
](https://www.gov.ie/en/directory/category/e1f4b5-intreo-offices/) to apply
for the PTJI scheme.

You will be asked to complete the application form [ PTJI1 (pdf)
](https://assets.gov.ie/37574/6a9dc8037f234e24899f5034d8d85501.pdf) and give
details of your part-time employment.

Your employer has to complete form PTJI2 at the end of each 4-week period to
confirm the hours that you worked and that you are insurably employed. You
must sign a declaration (using the same form) confirming that you worked less
than 24 hours each week. You must return this form to your Intreo Centre or
Social Welfare Branch Office. If there is any delay in returning this form,
payment is suspended until the form is received. Payment is made weekly by
EFT.

If your job ends or you finish the PTJI you may re-qualify for long-term
Jobseeker’s Allowance as long as there is no change in your circumstances
(other than finishing the part-time job). Alternatively, you may qualify for
Jobseeker’s Benefit if you have enough PRSI contributions.
