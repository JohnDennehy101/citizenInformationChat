##  Introduction

At some point in your life you may want to buy a home. This page covers the
different stages involved in doing this.

There are no residency-based restrictions to buying property in Ireland. You
can buy property here if you are an Irish citizen, EU/EEA citizen, non-EEA
national or even non-resident in Ireland. However, owning property in Ireland
does not mean you have the right to live here. Your [ right to live in Ireland
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/moving_country/moving_to_ireland/rights_of_residence_in_ireland/)
depends on your personal circumstances and is separate to property ownership.
