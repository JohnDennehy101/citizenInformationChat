###  Requisitions on Title and Deed of Conveyance  

After signing the contract and before the completion date of the sale, your
solicitor raises some general queries about the property with the seller's
solicitor. _Requisitions on Title_ are a standard set of questions relating to
the sale of a property that deal with such things as whether fixtures and
fittings are included in the sale.

When your solicitor gets a satisfactory reply to Requisitions on Title, they
will draft a _Deed of Conveyance_ which is then approved by the seller's
solicitor.

Your solicitor will check that there are no judgements against the seller (for
example, bankruptcy or sheriffs' searches). Your solicitor should also find
out where the title to the property is held (either in the Land Registry or
the Registry of Deeds) to ensure that there is nothing unusual relating to the
property, for example, an outstanding mortgage.

Once the Deed of Conveyance is approved by the seller's solicitor, your
solicitor will contact your mortgage provider to request the approved loan
cheque. This is the remaining balance of the purchase price. It is paid to the
seller's solicitor and all documentation, and keys to the premises are handed
over to your solicitor.
