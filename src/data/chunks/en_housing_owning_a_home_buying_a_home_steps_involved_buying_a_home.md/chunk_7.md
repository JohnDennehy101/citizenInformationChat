###  Get a survey

A seller does not have to tell you about defects in a property. So, before you
finalise the purchase, you should get a survey of the property to find out if
there are any defects. The survey will help highlight any issues you may not
have been aware of when you made your offer. For example, if your surveyor
finds that the roof needs to be replaced, you could change your offer to
account for this, or decide not to buy. The [ Society of Chartered Surveyors
Ireland (SCSI) ](http://www.scsi.ie/) is the professional body for chartered
surveyors.
