###  Sunday work and jobseeker's payments

**Sunday working is taken into account for Jobseeker's Benefit.** You must be
unemployed for 4 out of 7 consecutive days (including Sunday). If you work on
Sunday, you are considered to be employed for 1 day and 1/5th of your normal
rate of Jobseeker's Benefit will be deducted from your weekly payment.

Even though the social welfare employment week now takes Sunday into account,
you are not considered unemployed for 7 days. You are considered to be
unemployed for 6 days out of the 7-day social welfare employment week. This
means that for each week that you are fully unemployed, 6 days are deducted
from the days remaining on your Jobseeker's Benefit claim.

In the same way a person who works 2 days a week would have 4 days deducted
from the days remaining on their JB claim.
