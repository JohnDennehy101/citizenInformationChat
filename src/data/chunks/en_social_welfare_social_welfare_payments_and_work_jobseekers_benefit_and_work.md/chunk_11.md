###  Public holidays

Your employer must pay you for the public holidays which you don’t work as
long as you have worked at least 40 hours in the 5 weeks immediately before
the week of the public holiday. You can read more about [ public holidays
](/en/employment/employment-rights-and-conditions/leave-and-holidays/public-
holidays/) .

If you work and get Jobseeker's Benefit, you get a daily rate of Jobseeker's
Benefit for the days that you don't work. You will not get Jobseeker’s Benefit
for the day you receive payment from your employer for a public holiday, but
you can continue to get Jobseeker’s Benefit for the other days you do not
work.
