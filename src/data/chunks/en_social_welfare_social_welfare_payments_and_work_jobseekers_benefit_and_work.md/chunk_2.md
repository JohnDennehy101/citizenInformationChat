##  Introduction

One of the conditions for getting Jobseeker’s Benefit is that you must be
unemployed. However, you do not have to be totally unemployed – you must have
had a substantial loss of employment and be unemployed for at least 4 days out
of the 7-day employment week. Your earnings must also have reduced because of
the loss of employment.

You must also be available for and actively seeking work and you must meet all
the other [ conditions for Jobseeker’s Benefit ](/en/social-
welfare/unemployed-people/jobseekers-benefit/) . For example, you must have
enough social insurance (PRSI) contributions.

You may work and get Jobseeker’s Benefit if:

  1. Your days at work are reduced due to lack of work (systematic short-time working) 
  2. You are a part-time worker including job-sharing week on and week off (but not if you have chosen to do so) 
  3. You get casual work or part-time work 
  4. You have _subsidiary employment_

This page also looks at how taking up temporary work affects your Jobseeker’s
Benefit.

**Is Jobseeker’s Benefit taxable?**

Jobseeker’s Benefit is taxable in addition to any income from work.

However, it is not taxable if you are getting it because your hours at work
are temporarily reduced (systematic short-time working).
