###  Job-sharing and week on/off

If you have been working full-time and then enter a job-sharing arrangement,
you are not eligible for Jobseeker's Benefit because you have voluntarily
opted to work fewer hours or days.

If you are working week on or off, your entitlement to Jobseeker's Benefit
will depend on whether you are available for work on the week off.

In these types of situations, you need to be careful to ensure that [ you have
a full PRSI record ](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/social-
insurance-prsi/part-time-work-and-social-insurance-prsi/) . Depending on your
precise working arrangements, you could end up with only 26 paid
contributions. However, if you are getting Jobseeker's Benefit, you will get a
PRSI credit for the week you are not working.
