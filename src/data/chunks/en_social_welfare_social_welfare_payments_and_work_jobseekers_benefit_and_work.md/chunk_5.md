###  2\. Part-time workers

Where a Jobseeker's Benefit recipient is working for part of a week, the
amount of JB they are paid is based on a 5-day week. This means that for each
day that a person is employed, 1/5th of the normal rate of Jobseeker's Benefit
is deducted from their payment.

If they get part-time work for 2 days, they will get 3/5ths of the normal
Jobseeker's Benefit for that week. If they get part-time work for 3 days, they
will get 2/5ths of the normal rate of Jobseekerâ€™s Benefit for the week (see
table below).

You must still be unemployed for 4 days out of 7 to claim Jobseeker's Benefit.

Part-time workers must continue to look for full-time employment. Your
Jobseeker's Benefit **is** taxable if you are working part time. You must
claim Jobseeker's Benefit for at least 3 days in any week. If you get 4 days'
work, Jobseeker's Benefit is not paid at all.
