###  Temporary work

If you are getting Jobseeker's Benefit and are offered temporary work for at
least 4 days each week, your Jobseeker's Benefit will stop. If you are
unemployed for a second time within 26 weeks, your application for Jobseeker's
Benefit is not treated as a new claim.

**Example**  
---  
Susan is unemployed and has been getting Jobseeker's Benefit for 8 months. She
has 260 paid PRSI contributions, which means she can get Jobseeker's Benefit
for a maximum of 9 months. She was offered 2 months temporary work in a
factory. When her 2-months work ends, she is entitled to claim Jobseeker's
Benefit for another month.  
  
However, if you have used up your entitlement to Jobseeker's Benefit, you may
re-qualify by working and paying the appropriate PRSI contributions for at
least 13 weeks.
