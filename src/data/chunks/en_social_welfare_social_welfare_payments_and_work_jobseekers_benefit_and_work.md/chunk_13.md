####  Short-term employment or training

The Department of Social Protection also operates a fast-tracking system for
customers who sign off for a short period of up to 12 weeks to take up work or
to go on a training course. This ensures that payment is re-instated without
delay. It is important that you inform your local office in advance that you
are taking up work or training.
