##  Cost of changing your name by Deed Poll

There is a fee to have the Affidavit of Attesting Witness sworn before a [
Commissioner for Oaths ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/justice/civil-
law/commissioners-for-oaths/) or a practising [ solicitor
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/justice/courtroom/solicitors/) . There
is no fixed rate for legal fees, so ask your solicitor for information on
their costs before you hire them.

If you are non-EEA national, you will need a Change of Name licence to change
your name by Deed Poll (see above). If your application is successful there is
a €13 fee for your Change of Name licence.

If you enrol the Deed Poll in the Central Office of the High Court, you must
pay stamp duty of €60 on the document. You can do this at the [ Dublin Courts
stamping office ](https://www.courts.ie/content/dublin-courts-stamping-office)
or [ your local Courts Service branch ](https://www.courts.ie/content/find-us)
.
