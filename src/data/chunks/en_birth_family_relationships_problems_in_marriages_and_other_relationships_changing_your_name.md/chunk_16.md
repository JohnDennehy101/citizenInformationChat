##  Changing a child's name by Deed Poll

You can change the surname of a child in the [ Register of Births
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/birth-family-relationships/after-your-
baby-is-born/registering-birth-your-baby/) , but only in certain
circumstances.

You can also change the surname of a minor (under 18) by Deed Poll or common
usage.

**Children aged 14 to** **17**

Children aged between 14 and 17 years can execute (carry out) the deed poll
themselves, but they need the consent of both parents.

**Children under 14**

If a child is under 14, one of the child's parents must execute the Deed Poll
with the consent of the other parent. Consent of both parents is needed.

If the second parent does not consent to the Deed Poll, then the first parent
must ask the District Court to make an order removing the need for the second
parent’s consent for Deed Poll.

**Forms and fees**

Currently, the form to make an application for a change of name for a minor
(under 18) is not available on the Courts Service website. If you want to
change the name of a child by deed poll, contact [ deedpollquery@courts.ie
](mailto:deedpollquery@courts.ie) to request the necessary documentation. You
will also need to confirm if both parents or legal guardians of the child
consent to the application.

There is a €60 stamp duty fee on the Change of Name by Deed Poll and a €20
stamp duty fee on the Supplemental Affidavit. This means that changing a
child’s name by Deed Poll has an €80 stamp duty fee in total.
