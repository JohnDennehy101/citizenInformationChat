##  Changing your name after marriage

You do not have to change your name when you get married. However, you may
want to change your name for traditional, cultural or practical reasons.

If you change your name when you marry, you do not need to sign a Deed Poll.
Most organisations will accept your marriage certificate as proof of your name
change.

You earn your name by 'use and repute'. This means for most purposes, if you
want to be known by your married name, then you just use this name and ask
people to call you by it.
