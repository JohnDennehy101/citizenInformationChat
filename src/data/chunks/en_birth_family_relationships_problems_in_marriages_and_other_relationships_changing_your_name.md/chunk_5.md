##  Changing your name after separation or divorce

You can change back to your pre-marriage name after separation or divorce. You
will need to contact organisations to update your personal details, for
example, your bank, your employer, the Motor Tax Office, and your healthcare
provider.

Every organisation has different requirements so check what is needed to
complete the process. You usually need a valid form of identification and
certified evidence of your previous name. You may need to show a certified
copy of your [ separation agreement
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/birth-family-relationships/separation-
and-divorce/separation-agreement/) or [ divorce decree
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/birth-family-relationships/separation-
and-divorce/divorce-decrees/) .
