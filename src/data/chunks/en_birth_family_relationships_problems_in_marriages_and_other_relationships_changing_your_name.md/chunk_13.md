###  Change of Name licence for non-EEA nationals

If you are a non-EEA national aged 18 or over, and you want to change your
name by Deed Poll, you must first get a ‘ [ Change of Name licence
](https://www.irishimmigration.ie/my-situation-has-changed-since-i-arrived-in-
ireland/change-of-name-licence/) ’ from Immigration Service Delivery (ISD) –
see ‘Contact details’ below. This rule is set out under [ Section 9 of the
Aliens Act 1935
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1935/en/act/pub/0014/index.html) .

To get an application form for a Change of Name licence, write to the [ Change
of Name section ](https://www.irishimmigration.ie/my-situation-has-changed-
since-i-arrived-in-ireland/change-of-name-licence/#submit-application) in ISD.
Once you have been granted a change of name licence you must apply to the Deed
Poll Office to legally change your name. Include the original Change of Name
licence with your Deed Poll documents. If your application is successful there
is a €13 fee for your Change of Name licence. Your Change of Name licence will
be sent to you by registered post.

British citizens and children under 18 do not need a Change of Name licence to
change their name by Deed Poll.
