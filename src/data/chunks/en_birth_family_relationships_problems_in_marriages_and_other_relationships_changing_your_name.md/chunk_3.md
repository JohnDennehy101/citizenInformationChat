###  Getting proof of a name change

If you want written proof that you have changed your name, you can sign a
_Deed Poll._ A Deed Poll is a legal document saying you will take a particular
course of action from the date you sign it. This means from the date you sign
the Deed Poll, you can legally declare you:

  * Are no longer using your old name 
  * Will always use your new name 
  * Want to be called by your new name 

You do not need to sign a Deed Poll if you are changing your name after
marriage â€“ see below.
