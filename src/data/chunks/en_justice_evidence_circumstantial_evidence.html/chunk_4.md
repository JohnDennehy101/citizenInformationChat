##  Can circumstantial evidence be admitted in court?

Generally, circumstantial evidence can be admitted in court. However, the
courts are careful when the only evidence in a case is circumstantial
evidence.

Circumstantial evidence must be examined closely and it should be looked at
together with other evidence. A court would be very slow to convict a
defendant based on one piece of circumstantial evidence, for example, if the
defendantâ€™s fingerprints were found at the scene of the crime but there was no
other evidence.

However, if there are a number of different pieces of circumstantial evidence,
they have more weight when taken together. For example, in a theft case, if
the defendant was seen in the area at the time of the theft, their
fingerprints were found at the scene of the crime and they were found with a
large sum of money that they could not explain, the court would be more likely
to convict.
