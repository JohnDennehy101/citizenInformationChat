####  **Proportionate**

Your employerâ€™s monitoring must be fair, reasonable and proportional to the
perceived threat. For example, monitoring all your emails to make sure you are
not passing on confidential information about the company would not be
proportionate. However, using an automated system to scan for viruses in your
emails would likely be seen as proportionate.
