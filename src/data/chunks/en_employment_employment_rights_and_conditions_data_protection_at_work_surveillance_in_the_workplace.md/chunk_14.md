##  Monitoring your activities when working from home

When you work from home (remote working), your employer should follow the same
rules for monitoring your work. This includes telling you about:

  * Who is monitoring you 
  * What they are monitoring 
  * How they are monitoring you 
  * When they are monitoring you 

Your employer should tell you if they use employee surveillance software, such
as tracking your mouse and keyboard activity, email usage, social media,
files, and applications. This information may be included in a policy provided
by your employer.
