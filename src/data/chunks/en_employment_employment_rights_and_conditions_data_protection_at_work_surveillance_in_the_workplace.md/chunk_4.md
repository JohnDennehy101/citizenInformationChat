###  Information your employer must give you

Your employer should give you their policy on email and internet use at work,
including the use of social media. This policy is known as an _Acceptable
Usage Policy_ (AUP). The AUP should clearly state how much you can use company
devices for personal communication.

If your employer is monitoring your email and internet use, they must tell you
their reasons for doing this.

They must tell you:

  * Who is monitoring you 
  * What they are monitoring 
  * How they are monitoring you 
  * When they are monitoring you 

They must also tell you about the procedures they will take if someone breaks
the rules for using the internet and email, and how you can respond to these
claims.
