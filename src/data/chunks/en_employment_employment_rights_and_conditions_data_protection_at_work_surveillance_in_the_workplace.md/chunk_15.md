##  Accessing your data held by your employer

You can ask your employer to give you the data they have collected about you
while monitoring your email or internet use. You can also ask to see the
images captured of you on CCTV. This is called a [ Data Subject Access Request
](https://www.dataprotection.ie/en/dpc-guidance/data-subject-access-requests-
faq) .

Your employer must respond to your request within 1 month. This can be
extended by a further 2 months if your request is complex or if you have made
numerous requests.
