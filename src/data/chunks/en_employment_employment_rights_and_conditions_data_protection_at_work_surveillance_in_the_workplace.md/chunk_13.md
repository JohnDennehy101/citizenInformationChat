##  Personal devices at work

Using your own device for work can raise data protection issues. Your personal
device has personal information that your employer would not normally access.

However, your employer may have legitimate concerns, like protecting personal
data processed using your work email settings or protecting business
information on your device.

If your employer allows you to use your personal device for work, they should:

  * Have a 'bring your own device' (BYOD) policy explaining how you can use your device at work and your responsibilities 
  * Know where data from your device is stored and implement security measures 
  * Make sure data is kept secure during transfers from your personal device 
  * Consider how to manage data on your device when you leave the company, or if the device is stolen or lost
