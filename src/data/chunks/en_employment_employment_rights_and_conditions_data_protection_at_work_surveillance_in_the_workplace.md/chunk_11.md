###  Reasonable and unreasonable use of CCTV

Your employer must have a valid reason and consider whether using CCTV is
reasonable. For example, using CCTV to detect intruders, vandals or thieves
may be reasonable. However, using CCTV to constantly monitor employees is
intrusive and only justifiable in special circumstances.

It is very difficult for an employer to justify using CCTV to monitor areas
where you expect privacy, for example, in bathrooms. If your employer wants to
do this, they must show that several security breaches have occurred in these
areas. Even if they justify using CCTV in a bathroom, the cameras should never
capture images from cubicles or urinal areas.
