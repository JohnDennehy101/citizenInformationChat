##  Types of bullying

Bullying can be direct or indirect, and can include verbal, physical or
cyberbullying. Cyberbullying is bullying that happens online. It can include
offensive and abusive messages. It also includes hacking into accounts or
spreading rumours online.

Bullying can take many different forms such as:

  * Social exclusion and isolation 
  * Verbal abuse and insults 
  * Being treated less favourably than colleagues in similar roles 
  * Belittling a person’s opinion 
  * Spreading malicious rumours, gossip or innuendo 
  * Intrusion - pestering, spying or stalking 
  * Intimidation and aggressive interactions 
  * Excessive monitoring of work 
  * Withholding information needed for the person to do their job properly 
  * Repeatedly manipulating a person’s job contents and targets 
  * Blaming a person for things beyond their control 
  * Use of aggressive or obscene language 
  * Other menacing behaviour 

An isolated incident of the above behaviour is not considered to be bullying.

Bullying can happen at all levels within an organisation and can be conducted
by customers, clients and business contacts.
