##  What is bullying?

Bullying is _repeated inappropriate behaviour_ that undermines your right to
dignity at work. An isolated incident is not considered to be bullying, it
usually takes place over a period of time. Bullying can be done by one or more
people and can be aimed at an individual or a group.

The terms bullying and harassment are different. A behaviour can be considered
to be either bullying or harassment but not both. You can get more information
about [ harassment at work ](/en/employment/equality-in-work/harassment-at-
work/) .

By law, employers must prevent improper conduct or behaviour, which includes
bullying. A summary of your employerâ€™s anti-bullying policy should be
displayed prominently within the workplace.

The Health and Safety Authority (HSA) works to ensure that workplace bullying
is not tolerated and it provides [ information and advice on bullying
](http://www.hsa.ie/eng/Workplace_Health/Bullying_at_Work/Bullying_-
_Employee_Perspective/) . The Workplace Relations Commission (WRC) offers a [
mediation service ](/en/employment/enforcement-and-redress/workplace-
mediation/) to help resolve issues informally before a formal process is
initiated.
