](https://www.workplacerelations.ie/en/what_you_should_know/codes_practice/code-
of-practice-for-employers-and-employees-on-the-prevention-and-resolution-of-
bullying-at-work.pdf) is effective since 23 December 2020. This code replaced
the HSA’s ‘Code of Practice for Employers and Employees on the Prevention and
Resolution of Bullying at Work’ and the LRC (now WRC) ‘Code of Practice
Detailing Procedures for Addressing Bullying in the Workplace’.

The Code sets out the responsibilities and the roles of the HSA and the WRC.
It gives guidance for employees, employers and trade unions on dealing with an
informal and formal bullying complaint in the workplace.
