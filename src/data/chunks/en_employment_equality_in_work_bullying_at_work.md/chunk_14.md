###  Appealing the investigation

Your employerâ€™s Anti-bullying policy should include an appeals process. It
should set out the time period for making an appeal. The person hearing the
appeal should have had no involvement in the investigation.

You should be supported during the formal complaints process. For example
through the Contact Person or advisory support services, where possible.

For more details on the formal and appeals processes, see the [ Code of
Practice for Employers and Employees on the Prevention and Resolution of
Bullying at Work (pdf)
