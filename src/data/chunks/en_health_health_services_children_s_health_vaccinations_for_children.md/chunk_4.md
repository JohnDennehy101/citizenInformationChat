###  **Parental consent for vaccines**

If you are under 16, you must get your parent or guardian's consent for
vaccinations.

Vaccination is not compulsory but is strongly advised by the Department of
Health. You should discuss any concerns you may have with your GP (family
doctor) before making a decision about your childâ€™s immunisation.
