##  Inspecting workplaces for breaches of employment rights

The Inspection Services monitor employment conditions to ensure employers
comply with employment rights legislation. The service is also responsible for
enforcement of breaches.

They also carry out inspections and gather information in relation to other
employment laws. For example, employees or interested parties may ask for an
inspection in relation to the protection of young people in employment.
