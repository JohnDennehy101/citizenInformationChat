####  Employment rights issues

The WRC may offer a mediation service to try to resolve employment rights
complaints or disputes without the use of adjudication. They may only be
referred for mediation with the agreement of both parties to the complaint or
dispute. Where a complaint or dispute is not resolved, it will be referred for
adjudication. Find out more about [ workplace mediation
](/en/employment/enforcement-and-redress/workplace-mediation/) .

If you have made a complaint about your employment rights and you have agreed
to participate in mediation you may be offered the Early Resolution Service
(ERS) which is part of the Mediation Service. The ERS contacts the parties to
the dispute by phone with the aim of mediating a resolution. If the dispute is
not resolved by the service, your complaint will be sent to the adjudication
service.

**Internal workplace issues**

The Workplace Mediation Service aims to resolve workplace disputes and
disagreements, particularly between individuals or small groups.The service is
provided by officers of the WRC Conciliation and Advisory Services. This is a
confidential service, which gives employees and employers who are in dispute
an opportunity to work with a mediator to find a mutually agreed solution.
Problems referred to this service include breakdown in a working relationship
or issues arising from a grievance and disciplinary procedure.
