##  Finding out information about other countries

You should research the work opportunities and find out whether you will need
a visa or work permit in your chosen country. You can do this by getting in
touch with the embassy or consulate of the country that interests you. There
is [ a list of foreign embassies in Ireland
](https://www.ireland.ie/en/dfa/embassies/) on the Department of Foreign
Affairs website.

You can find information about jobs and accommodation using the internet and
the local papers. If you have a further or higher education qualification, you
can find out if [ your qualifications are recognised abroad
](https://www.qqi.ie/Articles/Pages/Qualifications-Recognition.aspx) .

Contact the [ Irish embassy or consulate
](https://www.ireland.ie/en/dfa/embassies/) of the country where you will be
working to find out as much as you can in advance of travel. (This is
especially important regarding entry visa and work permit requirements). Other
useful sources of information are immigrant, expatriate or Irish organisations
in the country where you are going to live and work.
