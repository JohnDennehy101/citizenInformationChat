##  Terms and conditions

When you pay a deposit, you enter into a contract with the seller or supplier.
The contract can be verbal or written. Both you and the seller are bound by
the [ terms and conditions ](/en/consumer/consumer-laws/terms-and-conditions/)
of the contract.

The terms and conditions must be clear and fair. Terms that can be unfair
include:

  * That deposits are non-refundable in all situations 
  * That if you cancel, you must pay all the sellerâ€™s expenses. The seller can only keep an amount that covers the actual losses from your cancellation. This could include costs already paid or loss of profit (for example, where you cancel at short notice) 
  * That the seller is allowed to keep the deposit if you cancel but you are not compensated if the seller cancels
