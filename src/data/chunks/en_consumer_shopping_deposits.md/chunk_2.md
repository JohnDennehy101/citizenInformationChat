##  What is a deposit?

A deposit is a sum of money that you pay upfront as an intention to buy
something.

You may be asked to pay a deposit for products and services, for example, when
ordering something from a shop, getting home improvements or hiring equipment.

When you pay a deposit, you pay the balance of money owed on delivery of the
item or completion of the service.

You and the seller agree the amount of the deposit and other terms â€“ see
below.
