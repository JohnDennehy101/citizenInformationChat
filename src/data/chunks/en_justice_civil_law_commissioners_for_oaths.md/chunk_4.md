##  Process

When you go to a Commissioner for Oaths they will:

  * Make sure you have a document that is written down 
  * Check your identification 
  * Establish that you have read the affidavit or document and understand what it says 
  * Have you swear that the affidavit is true 
  * Verify that the affidavit was properly sworn by completing a "jurat" which records your name, the place and the date. 

In order to swear you will use a sacred text. The Commissioner for Oaths will
have a variety of sacred texts available. If you are not religious then you
may make an affirmation rather than an oath.
