###  Category F1 fireworks

Category F1 fireworks can be bought and used by the general public. These are
called very low hazard fireworks.

F1 fireworks:

  * Pose the least danger 
  * Make very little noise 
  * Are for use in a limited space (including indoors) 

Examples include party poppers, ground spinners, Christmas crackers and some
sparklers. Importers of these fireworks must have a licence (except for
Christmas crackers).

Category F1 fireworks can be dangerous and their use should be supervised. F1
fireworks cannot be sold to anyone under the age of 12.

**Bangers are not in Category F1 and it is illegal for the general public to
import, possess or use them.**
