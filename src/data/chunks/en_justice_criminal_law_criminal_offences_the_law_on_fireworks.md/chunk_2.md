##  Introduction

Fireworks include items which burn and explode to produce noise or a visual
effect for entertainment. Sparklers, bangers, fountains and rockets are all
fireworks.

Most fireworks can only be bought and used by professional, licenced
operators. Only the least dangerous fireworks can be sold to the general
public.

Fireworks are dangerous. You need a licence to import them to Ireland and the
way they are stored and sold is regulated by laws on explosives.
