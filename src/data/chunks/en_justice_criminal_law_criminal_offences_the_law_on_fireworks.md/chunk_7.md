##  Fireworks and Garda powers

The Gardaí have wide powers to investigate these offences. If the Gardaí
reasonably suspect that you have fireworks for sale or supply without a
licence they may:

  * Request your name and address 
  * Request you to go to the Garda station to verify your name and address (if they are not satisfied your details are correct) 
  * Search you without a warrant and detain you for the time required to carry out the search 
  * Enter and search any vehicle, vessel or aircraft without a warrant, if they suspect that a firework may be found there 
  * Seize and detain anything connected with fireworks found in the course of the search 

If the Gardaí suspect that you have committed an offence of sale or supply of
fireworks without a licence, they may arrest you without a warrant.
