##  Introduction

Everyone has arguments, and everyone disagrees with their partners, family
members and others close to them from time to time.

But if this becomes the norm in your relationship and you feel afraid of your
partner, then this is a sign of an abusive relationship. You can feel as if
you have no power over your life and that you are being controlled by your
partner.

Abuse can happen to anyone at any age and in any type of relationship. It can
happen to adults and it can happen to teenagers. And you don't have to be
married or living with your partner for them to act abusively towards you.
