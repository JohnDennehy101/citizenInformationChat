###  Emotional support

  * Listen, try to understand and be careful not to blame them. Nothing they do or say can justify the abuser's behaviour. 
  * Tell them they are not alone and that there are supports available if they need them. 
  * Support them as a friend. Encourage them to express their feelings, whatever they are. 
  * Don't tell them to leave the relationship if they are not ready to do this. This is their decision.
