##  Types of abuse

An abusive relationship is where one person uses abuse to control and have
power over their partner in an intimate relationship. It can be:

  * Physical abuse 
  * Emotional abuse 
  * Online abuse 
  * Sexual abuse 
  * Economic (financial) abuse 
  * Digital abuse (carried out online or using technology) 

Coercive control is another type of abusive behaviour. This is when a
boyfriend or girlfriend, partner, husband or wife, or ex uses an ongoing
pattern of controlling, coercive and threatening behaviours to trap the person
in a relationship. Coercive control can make it impossible or even dangerous
to leave an abusive relationship and can include all or some forms of abuse.

This can result in a person changing their routines and losing contact with
family and friends. Coercive control can damage a personâ€™s physical and
emotional well-being.
