###  Clawback of stamp duty reliefs

There are clawbacks for certain stamp duty reliefs. A clawback is where you
have to repay money or benefits you have received because you have not met
certain criteria or contractual obligations. For some stamp duty reliefs you
have to meet certain qualifying criteria for a number of years or the relief
will be ‘clawed back’. This can be 2 or 5 years for stamp duty reliefs. If you
fail to meet the criteria for the entire period, you must pay back the stamp
duty and any interest. There is more information about [ stamp duty clawbacks
