##  How to apply

Your [ solicitor ](/en/justice/courtroom/solicitors/) will calculate how much
stamp duty is due and request this from you before the sale is closed. The
amount is paid to the Revenue Commissioners, who place a stamp on the [
property deeds ](/en/housing/owning-a-home/buying-a-home/property-deeds/) .
Without this stamp, the deeds cannot be registered.
