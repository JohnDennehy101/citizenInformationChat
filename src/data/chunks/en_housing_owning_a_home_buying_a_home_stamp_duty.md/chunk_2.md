##  What is stamp duty?

Stamp duty is tax you pay when you transfer property. It is charged on the
written documents that transfer ownership of land and buildings. Stamp duty
applies to residential property such as houses, apartments or sites with
agreement to build. It is also applies to non-residential property, such as,
land or housing sites without residential buildings - see [ Rates
](stamp_duty.en.html#l62fd2) below.

In general, the only factor affecting the amount of stamp duty is the value of
the property. However, a higher stamp duty rate applies if you buy 10 or more
residential houses or duplexes at a time, or in a year. This [ measure
](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/a36ff-financial-resolution-stamp-duty-
measure-for-bulk-purchases/) was introduced to discourage investment funds
from buying up housing estates. See ‘How much stamp duty will I pay?’ below
for information on the increased rate, including exemptions and refunds.
