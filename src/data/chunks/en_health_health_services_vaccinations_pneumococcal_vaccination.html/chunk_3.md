##  What is pneumococcal disease?

Pneumococcal disease is caused by bacteria called ‘streptococcus pneumoniae’.

It can sometimes lead to life-threatening illnesses, including:

  * Pneumonia 
  * Meningitis 
  * Septicaemia (sepsis) 

It can also cause less serious illness, such as localised infections such as
middle ear infections, bronchitis or sinusitis.

If you are infected by the bacteria, you can spread pneumococcal disease to
other people by sneezing or coughing. You can also spread it by being in close
contact with other people.

You can get pneumococcal disease at any age. However, elderly people, young
children, and people with long-term medical conditions are most at risk.
