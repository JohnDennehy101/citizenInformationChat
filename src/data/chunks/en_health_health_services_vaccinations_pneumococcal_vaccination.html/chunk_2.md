##  Introduction

Pneumococcal disease is a serious type of bacterial illness. If it enters your
lungs or blood stream, it can be life-threatening (especially if you are old
or medically vulnerable). However, a pneumococcal vaccine (also called the
pneumonia vaccine) can help to protect you.

The HSE offers this vaccine free of charge for certain groups of people who
are at higher risk from the illness.
