###  **Noise from alarms**

All alarm installers must have licences from the [ Private Security Authority
](https://www.psa.gov.ie/) . To get a licence, they have to follow certain
standards. This includes a limit on the length of time an external alarm can
sound for â€“ the maximum under the European standard is 15 minutes.

The local authority, the EPA or an individual may take action under the EPA
Act to deal with breaches of these standards.
