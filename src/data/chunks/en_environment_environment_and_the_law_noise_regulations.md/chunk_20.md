##  Noise from entertainment venues and events

Contact your local authority if you want to complain about noise coming from:

  * Bars 
  * Restaurants 
  * Nightclubs 
  * Concerts 
  * Other out-door events 

Your local authority may serve a notice to the organisers of the entertainment
to prevent or limit noise. Then if the organisers do not stop or limit the
noise, the local authority may prosecute them.

If you want to complain about noise from outside a premise or event, for
example, anti-social behaviour, you should contact An Garda Síochánna. The
Gardaí have the power to arrest a person for breach of the peace in a public
place.
