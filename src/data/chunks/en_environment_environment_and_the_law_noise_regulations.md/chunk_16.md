###  **Noise from rented properties**

If there is noise coming from a rented home, you should approach the tenant
first and ask them to lower the noise. If this doesn’t work, you can complain
to the landlord. This may be a:

  * Private landlord 
  * Local authority 
  * Housing association 

People who are renting from private landlords or [ housing associations
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/housing/local-authority-and-social-
housing/approved-housing-bodies/) have certain [ obligations
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/housing/renting-a-home/tenants-rights-
and-responsibilities/tenants-rights-and-obligations/) . These include not
engaging in anti-social behaviour, which includes persistent noise that
affects others around them.

You can complain to the [ Residential Tenancies Board (RTB)
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/housing/renting-a-home/resolving-
disputes/residential-tenancies-board/) if a private landlord or housing
association doesn’t enforce these obligations.

If the tenant is renting from a local authority housing, they must avoid
causing any nuisance such as noise to other properties around you. If they do
make excessive and persistent noise, they are breaking the tenancy agreement
and the local authority can take steps to make sure they follow the terms of
the agreement. You can read the [ legislation on noise from rented properties
](https://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2009/act/22/enacted/en/html) .
