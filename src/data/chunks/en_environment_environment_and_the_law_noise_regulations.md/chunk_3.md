##  Who do I complain to about noise pollution?

While the law does not mention an exact level or standard of noise that is
illegal, if noise is affecting your quality of life, then you have a right to
complain. Who you complain to depends on the source of the noise.

Your first step should generally be to contact the person causing the noise to
try to fix the issue. If this doesnâ€™t work, you can take the necessary next
steps to make your complaint.

There are different bodies who deal with these complaints, but the 2 main
places to make your complaints are:

  * Local authorities 
  * The [ District Court ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/justice/courts-system/district-court/)
