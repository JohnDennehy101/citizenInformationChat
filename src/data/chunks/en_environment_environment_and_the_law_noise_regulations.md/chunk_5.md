###  **District Court**

If you are still concerned about excessive noise, you can make a formal
complaint to the District Court. This should be the last step you take to
resolving the issue. This is outlined in [ regulations made under the Act
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1994/en/si/0179.html) .

You can get a complaint form in your local district court office and will have
to pay a fee to process the complaint.
