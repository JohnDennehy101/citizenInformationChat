##  Who can apply to the courts for access?

  * A parent of the child 
  * Certain relatives of the child such as brothers, sisters, aunts, uncles, and grandparents 
  * A guardian of the child 
  * Any other adult who the child lives with, or lived with previously 

A father may apply for access whether or not he is a [ guardian ](/en/birth-
family-relationships/cohabiting-couples/guardianship-and-cohabiting-couples/)
. He can do this even if his name is not on the child's birth certificate, and
even where his application for joint guardianship has been turned down.

If both guardianship and access are being applied for, then separate
applications must be made, but both applications will be heard by the court at
the same time.

The Courts Service has an ' [ Eligibility Checker
](https://services.courts.ie/Family-Law/arrangements-for-
children/access/access-rights) ' tool you can use to see whether you are
eligible to apply for access.
