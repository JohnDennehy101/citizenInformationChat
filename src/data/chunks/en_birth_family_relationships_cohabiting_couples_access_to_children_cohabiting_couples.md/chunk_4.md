##  The role of the courts

When the parents of a child separate and they cannot agree on access rights,
the courts will decide. The welfare of the child will be the most important
factor.

In general, the courts consider that it is very important for the welfare of a
child that it should have a relationship with both of their parents, and they
are very slow to deny access rights to the natural parent of a child.

Where the child's age and level of understanding are appropriate, the voice of
the child can be taken into consideration as part of any court decisions.
