##  Registration and inspection of residential care

By law, all residential services must be inspected and registered by HIQA to
be allowed to operate. Residential services must re-register with HIQA every 3
years.

HIQA inspections ensure that services meet the requirements set out by the [
Health Act (2007)
](https://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2013/si/415/made/en/print) and the [
National Standards ](https://www.hiqa.ie/reports-and-
publications/standard/national-standards-residential-care-settings-older-
people-ireland) . If the service does not comply with the regulations or meet
the Standards, it may fail to achieve registration status or lose its
registration status.

The inspections are a mixture of both announced and unannounced visits. They
can happen at any time. This includes during the day, evenings, and weekends
or at night.

The registration and inspection process is independent and reports are
published after every inspection. The inspection reports provide information
to residents, their families and the general public about the standards of
care in individual centres.
