##  Introduction

Residential care services must meet certain standards which include the
quality of accommodation and care.

[ The Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) ](http://www.hiqa.ie/)
is responsible for inspecting and registering residential care services for
older people, such as nursing homes.

All residential care services must be registered and independently inspected.
This includes public, private and voluntary nursing homes.

Before July 2009 the Health Service Executive (HSE) was responsible for the
registration and inspection of private and voluntary residential care services
and provided [ inspection reports up to that date
](http://www.hse.ie/eng/services/publications/olderpeople/Nursing_Home_Reports/)
.
