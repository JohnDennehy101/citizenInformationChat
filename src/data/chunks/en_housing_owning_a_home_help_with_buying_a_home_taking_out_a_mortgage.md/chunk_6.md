###  How the limits work

There are 2 types of limit:

  * **Loan-to-value (LTV)** is based on the ratio of the size of the loan to the value of the home you want to buy 
  * **Loan-to-income (LTI)** is based on ratio of the size of the loan to the income(s) of the borrower(s) 

In general, you will have to meet both of these limits for your mortgage to
meet the Central Bank’s requirements. The lender must also assess each loan
application on a case-by-case basis – see ‘Assessment by the lender’ below.
The regulations do allow lenders to be flexible in some cases – see below.
