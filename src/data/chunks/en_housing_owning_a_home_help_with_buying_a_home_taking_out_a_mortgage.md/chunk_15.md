###  Do your mortgage research

You’ll need to do your research and ask some questions about the loan and its
implications over the long term, such as:

  * How does the interest rate ( [ APR ](http://www.consumerhelp.ie/jargon-buster#apr) ) [ compare to others in the market ](http://www.consumerhelp.ie/mortage-interest-rates) ? 
  * What is the lender’s policy and track record on changing interest rates. Even a small variation in interest rates can have a large effect on the overall cost of your mortgage. You can use this [ mortgage rate calculator ](http://www.consumerhelp.ie/rate-change-calculator) to assess the impact of changes in interest rates on your repayments. 
  * Can I realistically afford to keep up the monthly repayments if my income falls or my outgoings increase? You need to assess your continuing ability to repay as circumstances change over time. 
  * If I accept an introductory offer, will I be able to manage when the ‘introductory’ period is over? Again, you need to calculate your ability to repay – over the full term of the mortgage, not just the first few years. 
  * What insurance do I need on the mortgage? Read about [ insurance protection on mortgages ](/en/housing/owning-a-home/buying-a-home/insurance-protection-on-mortgages/) .
