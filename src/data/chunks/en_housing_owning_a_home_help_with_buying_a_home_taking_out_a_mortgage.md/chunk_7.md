###  Loan-to-income limit (LTI)

There are different LTI limits for different types of buyers. If you are a:

  * **First-time buyer of your primary residence** , you can borrow 4 times your gross annual income 
  * **Non-first-time home buyer** , you can borrow 3.5 times your gross annual income 

The LTI limits do not apply to buy-to-let mortgages.
