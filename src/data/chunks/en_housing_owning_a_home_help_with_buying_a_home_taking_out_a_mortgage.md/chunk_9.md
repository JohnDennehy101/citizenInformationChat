###  Loan-to-value limit (LTV)

There are different LTV limits for different categories of buyer. If you are
buying a:

  * **Property that will be your primary residence** , a 90% LTV limit applies on the full value of the property. This means you will need a 10% deposit for your house or apartment. 
  * **Property that will not be your primary residence** , including buy-to-let properties, a limit of 70% LTV applies 

The LTV limits do not apply to **borrowers in negative equity** applying for a
mortgage for a new property. However, lenders may still opt to apply stricter
lending standards, based on their assessment of each case.

The valuation of the property must have been carried out no later than 4
months before the date of the mortgage agreement.
