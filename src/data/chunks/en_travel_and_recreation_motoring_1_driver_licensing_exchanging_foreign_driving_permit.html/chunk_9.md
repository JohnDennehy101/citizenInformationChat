###  Other licenses

If your licence was issued in a country that is not in the EU, EEA or the list
of recognised states, and you hold a national driving licence and an
international driving permit from your own country, you may drive in Ireland
for the duration of your temporary visit (up to 12 months).

If your stay in Ireland will be more than 12 months, you can apply for an
Irish driving licence but you will need to go through the full driver
licensing procedure. You can read what you need to do in our page on [ Steps
learning to drive ](/en/travel-and-recreation/motoring/driver-
licensing/learning-to-drive/) .

You can only exchange a full driving licence. Foreign learner permits cannot
be used to drive in Ireland or be exchanged for an Irish learner permit.
