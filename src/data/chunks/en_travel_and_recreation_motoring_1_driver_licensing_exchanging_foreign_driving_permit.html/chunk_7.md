###  Recognised states

If your licence was issued by one of the countries or territories listed in
‘recognised states’ above, you can drive in Ireland for up to 1 year when
visiting, providing your licence is valid.

If you become normally resident in Ireland, you should exchange your driving
licence or begin the process of applying for an Irish driving licence. You are
normally a resident in Ireland if, because of personal and occupational ties,
you usually live here for at least 185 days in each calendar year.
