###  Tax conditions

The terms and conditions of employment must be changed to refer to the
Taxsaver ticket (to highlight that you are choosing a benefit instead of
salary). The change must not be retrospective and must be in writing.

Employees cannot exchange the benefit for cash.

The choice to accept benefit instead of cash cannot be made more than once a
year, and then only with the consent of the employer.
