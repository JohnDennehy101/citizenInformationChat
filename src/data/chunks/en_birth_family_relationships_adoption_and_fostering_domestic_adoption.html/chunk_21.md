###  Can the birth mother (or guardian) change their mind?

If the mother or guardian withdraws (takes back) their consent after the child
has been placed for adoption, the adopters may apply to the High Court for an
order. If the court is satisfied that it is in the best interests of the
child, it will make an order giving custody of the child to the adopting
parents for a specified period. The court can also authorise the Adoption
Authority of Ireland to dispense with the mother's (or guardian's) consent to
the making of the adoption order.

If a mother changes her mind about adoption before the adoption order is made,
but the adopting parents refuse to give up the child, she can begin legal
proceedings to have custody of her child returned to her.
