###  The birth father

If the birth father is not a guardian of the child (for example, if he and the
mother are not married), he **does not have an automatic right to give, or to
withhold, consent for adoption** . However, he is entitled to be consulted
about the adoption of his child. He can also make an application for
guardianship so that he can withhold his consent.

If you (the birth father) are concerned that your partner or former partner
plans to place your child for adoption without letting you know, you can ask
the Adoption Authority of Ireland to notify you. To do this, you must [ record
your details recorded on the Birth Father Register (pdf)
](http://aai.gov.ie/images/download/Form-F3-Natural-Father-Register-Form.pdf)
. You can do this before your child is born, if necessary. This register is
checked against all applications for adoption.
