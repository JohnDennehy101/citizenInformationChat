##  Who can adopt a child in Ireland?

To adopt a child, you must be at least 21 years of age and resident in
Ireland. If you are adopting the child as a couple, and one of you is the
childâ€™s mother or father or relative, only one of you must be at least 21.

There is **no upper age limit** for adoptive parents.

You can adopt if you are:

  * A married couple living together 
  * A couple living together in a civil partnership 
  * A couple _cohabiting_ together (living together and in a committed relationship) for at least 3 years 
  * The mother, father or relative of the child ( _relative_ meaning a grandparent, brother, sister, uncle or aunt of the child, and/or the spouse of any such person; the _relationship to the child_ being traced through the mother or the father) 

If you are a **sole applicant** (applying for adoption on your own), and you
do not fall into any of the categories listed above, you may only adopt if the
Adoption Authority of Ireland is satisfied with the particular circumstances
of the case.
