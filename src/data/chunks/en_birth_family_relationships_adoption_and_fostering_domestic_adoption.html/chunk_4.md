###  Step-parent adoption

Step-parent adoption is where you apply to adopt your partner’s child.

Your partner can consent (agree) to the adoption and still keep their own
parental rights and responsibilities. In a step-parent adoption, you and your
partner share parenting duties once the _adoption order_ is made. Read about
adoption orders in the section ‘Steps involved in adopting a child’, below.

The child must have lived with their parent and you (the prospective step-
parent) **together, for a minimum of 2 years** .
