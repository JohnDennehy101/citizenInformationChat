###  You are granted a ‘Declaration to Adopt’

The Adoption Authority of Ireland is sent:

  * Your application for assessment 
  * The social worker’s report 
  * The local adoption committee’s recommendations 

If all documents are in place and correct, the Adoption Authority of Ireland
will consider the recommendations and decide whether to grant a _Declaration
to Adopt_ (sometimes called a ‘Declaration of Eligibility and Suitability’).
The declaration is like a ‘license to adopt’, and may include the age and
health status of a child whom you are considered suitable to parent (based on
the information in the assessment report).

The Declaration of Eligibility and Suitability is granted for a period of **2
years from the date it is issued** . If your declaration is about to expire,
you can apply to have it **extended by a further 1 year** , provided there
have been no changes in your circumstances.

If your circumstances have changed (for example, you moved home or your health
status has changed), you must tell the Adoption Authority of Ireland **in
writing** . Read more about [ what to do if your situation has changed

adopters.html#sppb-modal-1550762641076) under the heading ‘Declaration of
Eligibility and Suitability’ on the Adoption Authority’s website.
