###  Why would the DPP not prosecute?

The most common reason for deciding not to prosecute is a lack of evidence.
The DPP needs to have enough evidence to convince the court beyond a
reasonable doubt that a person is guilty.

There are some circumstances where the DPP may decide it is better not to
prosecute despite having enough evidence, for example, if the offender is
under 18 or is seriously ill.
