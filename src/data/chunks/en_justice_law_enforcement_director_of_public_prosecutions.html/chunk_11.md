###  Can I request reasons for the decision?

You can request a summary of the reasons for the decision not to prosecute if
you are:

  * A victim of crime, and the decision was made after 16 November 2015 
  * A family member of a victim in a fatal case, where the death took place after 22 October 2008 
  * A solicitor acting on behalf of either of the above 

You must make your request within 28 days of the date you are told of the
decision not to prosecute.

If the decision not to prosecute was made by the Gardaí, a victim can ask the
Gardaí for a summary of the reasons for the decision.
