###  If the cause of death is not known

A doctor cannot give you the Death Notification Form if they do not know the
cause of death, or if they didn't see the deceased person in the one month
before the death occurred. In this case, they must inform a coroner who may
decide a post-mortem is necessary.

If the person died as the result of an accident, or in violent or unexplained
circumstances, the coroner must be informed.

There may be a delay in registering a death where a [ post-mortem
](/en/death/sudden-or-unexplained-death/postmortems/) is carried out. The
death is automatically registered where an [ inquest ](/en/death/sudden-or-
unexplained-death/inquests-and-inquest-reports/) or post-mortem is held at the
request of the coroner. [ The coroner ](/en/death/sudden-or-unexplained-
death/coroners/) issues a certificate to the Registrar containing all the
details to be registered.

While you are waiting for an inquest or post-mortem to be carried out, you can
get an Interim Certificate of the Fact of Death from the [ Coroner Service
](http://www.coroners.ie/en/cor/pages/coronercontactdetails) . You can use
this to inform institutions like banks, insurance companies and the Department
of Social Protection that the death has occurred.
