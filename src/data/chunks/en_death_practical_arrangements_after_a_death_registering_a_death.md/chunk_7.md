##  If the person who died had no relatives

The death must be registered by a ‘qualified informant’. This is usually a
close family member of the person who has died, but can also be:

  * A relative of the deceased person 
  * Someone who lived with the deceased person 
  * The deceased person’s personal representative 
  * A person who was present at the death 
  * An official of the hospital or institution where the person died 
  * A person who found the body or took charge of that body 
  * The person who arranged the funeral 
  * Any other person who has knowledge of the death and knows the details needed to register the death
