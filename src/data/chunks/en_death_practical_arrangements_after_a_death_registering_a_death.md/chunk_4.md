##  What you need to register the death

To register a death, you must bring a Death Notification Form stating the
cause of death to any Registrar of Births, Marriages and Deaths.

You get the Death Notification Form from the doctor who attended the person
who died. You must complete Part 2 of the Death Notification Form and take it
to the registry office. You will need to bring photo ID with you. The
registration is free.

You **should** register the death within 3 months of the date the person died.
However, you have up to 12 months to register the death. If you need to
register a death more than 12 months after the person died, you will need to
contact the [ General Register Office
](https://www.gov.ie/en/campaigns/af7893-general-register-office/) .
