##  Death certificate fees

There is no charge for registering a death. But you may have to pay for a copy
of the death certificate.

The fees charged for a certificate are as follows:

  * €20 for a full standard certificate 
  * Free if the deceased was less than 1 year old and you are getting the death certificate at the time of registering the death 
  * €5 for an uncertified copy of an entry in the Register 
  * €10 to have a certificate authenticated (only available from the General Register Office) 

You do not need to apply for a copy of a death certificate for social welfare
purposes, as the Department of Social Protection will have access to this
information once the death has been registered.
