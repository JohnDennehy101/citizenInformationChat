##  Introduction

Part-time workers over 16 years of age and earning over â‚¬38 in each _PRSI
contribution_ week are liable to pay social insurance. It is called [ Pay
Related Social Insurance (PRSI) ](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-
system/social-insurance-prsi/social-insurance/) because the amount of social
insurance you pay depends on your earnings and the type of work you do.

If you are a part-time worker you may not be making the maximum amount of PRSI
contributions each year. The tax year and the PRSI contribution week start 1
January every year. As a result, the **PRSI contribution week** can differ
from the **working week** _._ If you are in part-time work you need to be
fully aware of the possible effect this can have on your social insurance
entitlements.
