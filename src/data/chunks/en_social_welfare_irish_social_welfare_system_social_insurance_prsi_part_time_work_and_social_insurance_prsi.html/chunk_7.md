##  How much PRSI do part-time workers pay?

To determine the rate of PRSI you and your employer pay, your gross pay is
divided by the number of contribution weeks that is covered by your pattern of
work. More information can be found in our page about [ your liability to pay
PRSI ](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/social-insurance-
prsi/social-insurance/) .

  
If you earn between €38 and €352 you do not have to pay PRSI. However, your
employer pays PRSI. More information can be found in our page about [ your
employer's duty to pay social insurance ](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-
welfare-system/social-insurance-prsi/paying-social-insurance/) .
