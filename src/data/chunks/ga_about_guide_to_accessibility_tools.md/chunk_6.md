###  **JAWS**

**Description:** JAWS, Job Access With Speech, is a screen reader, developed
for computer users whose vision loss prevents them from seeing screen content
or navigating with a mouse. JAWS provides speech and Braille output for the
most popular computer applications on your PC.

  * **Activating JAWS:**
    * Install JAWS from [ Freedom Scientific ](https://www.freedomscientific.com/) . Launch the program. 
  * **Using JAWS on the site:**
    * Utilise the JAWS commands (e.g., Insert+F7 for a list of links, Insert+F6 for headings). 

JAWS is also consistent across Windows versions, with similar installation and
usage patterns. Features may vary slightly, and some advanced settings could
differ based on OS-specific capabilities.
