###  Deposits

You cannot ask for upfront payments of more than 2 month’s rent when renting
out a property. This includes a deposit of a month’s rent and one month’s rent
in advance. This came in under the [ Residential Tenancies (No.2) Act 2021
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2021/act/17/enacted/en/html) . Students
in student-specific tenancies can opt-out of this restriction and pay a larger
upfront payment if they want. However, this opt-out is only allowed if the
student is paying rent and tuition to the same provider, such as a public or
private educational provider.

You can only withhold a tenant’s deposit if:

  * The tenant has not given you proper notice when [ ending the tenancy ](http://www.threshold.ie/advice/ending-a-tenancy/ending-your-tenancy/)
  * You have been left with unpaid rent or outstanding bills, for example for electricity or gas 
  * The tenant has caused damage beyond normal [ wear and tear ](https://www.rtb.ie/during-a-tenancy/wear-and-tear)

The Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2015 provides for a [ tenancy
deposit protection scheme
](https://www.kildarestreet.com/wrans/?id=2018-06-26a.1517) , where the RTB
would manage and hold deposits for tenants and landlords. These provisions are
not yet in effect.
