##  Take your complaint further

The WRC can adjudicate on disputes, grievances and claims made by individuals
or small groups of workers under a range of employment legislation.

You can make a complaint under either the Industrial Relations Acts 1969-2015
or the Terms of Employment Acts 1994 and 2014. In either case, you start by
applying to the Workplace Relations Commission, using the [ online complaint
form
](https://www.workplacerelations.ie/en/Complaints_Disputes/Refer_a_Dispute_Make_a_Complaint/)
.

You must make the complaint while you are still employed by the employer who
is paying you late or within 6 months of leaving that employment.
