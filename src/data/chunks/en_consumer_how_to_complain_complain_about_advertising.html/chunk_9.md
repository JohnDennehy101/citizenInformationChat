###  Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC)

If you feel that an ad is misleading or false, you can report it to the CCPC.

The CCPC is responsible for enforcing the rules around business advertising in
Ireland and can take action, where appropriate.

The CCPC cannot get compensation for you where you have made a bad buying
decision because of misleading advertising. You may have a case against the
advertiser using the Small Claims Court.

The CCPC has more information about [ misleading advertising
