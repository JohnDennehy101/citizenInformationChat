###  Advertising Standards Authority investigation

The Advertising Standards Authority will review your complaint to check if it
is an issue that is under its remit and if an investigation is needed.

The Advertising Standards Authority will tell you if your complaint does not
fall under its remit, or it decides an investigation is not appropriate (and
the reason). The Advertising Standards Authority can refer you to another
organisation for help.

If the Advertising Standards Authority decides to investigate your complaint,
it will tell the advertiser (or the agency involved). The advertiser has 10
days to respond to the Advertising Standards Authority and comment on the
investigation.

When the Advertising Standards Authority gets a response, a summary of the
case and the Advertising Standards Authorityâ€™s recommendation is sent to the
Complaints Committee. The Advertising Standards Authority sends a copy of this
recommendation to you and the other party. You can give more information or
comments before the Complaints Committee decide on whether or not the advert
has breached the code rules.
