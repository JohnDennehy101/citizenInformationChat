##  What is Partial Capacity Benefit?

Partial Capacity Benefit is a social welfare scheme which allows you to return
to work or self-employment (if you have reduced capacity to work) and continue
to get a payment from the Department of Social Protection (DSP).

If you have been getting Illness Benefit (for a minimum of 6 months) or
Invalidity Pension and wish to return to work, you may qualify for Partial
Capacity Benefit if your capacity for work is reduced by your medical
condition.

You will qualify for Partial Capacity Benefit if your restriction on capacity
for work is assessed as moderate, severe, or profound. You will not qualify if
it is assessed as mild.

You can check the financial consequences of starting work and claiming Partial
Capacity Benefit by using the [ Benefit of Work Estimator
](https://www.mywelfare.ie/BenefitOfWorkDAestimator) tool on welfare.ie.

The work you do while on Partial Capacity Benefit does not have to be for
rehabilitative or therapeutic purposes.
