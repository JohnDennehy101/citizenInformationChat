###  When to apply

You must apply for Partial Capacity Benefit within the 21 days before you
start work. Your application won’t be accepted if you start work more than 21
days before you apply.

You must start work within 13 weeks of the Department of Social Protection
(DSP) getting your application. However, you should wait until you get written
confirmation of a moderate, severe, or profound medical result before you
start work. While this is not essential, the DSP recommends waiting, because a
‘mild’ medical result means you are not entitled to PCB.

If you decide to return to work before getting a medical decision, you must
tell the PCB section and the DSP section paying your [ Illness Benefit
](/en/social-welfare/disability-and-illness/illness-benefit/) or [ Invalidity
Pension ](/en/social-welfare/disability-and-illness/invalidity-pension/) .
This is to avoid any over-payments, and because you can’t work while getting
Illness Benefit or Invalidity Pension.

Partial Capacity Benefit is not paid to people over 66. You should apply for a
State Pension at least 3 months before your 66th birthday. Or, you can [ defer
your State Pension (Contributory)
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/older-and-retired-
people/deferring-your-state-pension-contributory/) up to your 70th birthday.
