##  Private privilege

You have a "privilege against self-incrimination". This means that you can
refuse to answer questions or hand over documents that may implicate you in
criminal proceedings.

You may have a "legal professional privilege". This means that a legal advisor
and their client cannot be forced to reveal communications between them.

In addition, if any communication is made when legal action is being
considered, then that communication is privileged even if it is not a
communication between lawyer and client.

Priests are allowed to refuse to answer questions relating to what was said in
the confessional. This is known as the _sacerdotal privilege_ . Similarly,
communications with a counsellor may also be privileged.
