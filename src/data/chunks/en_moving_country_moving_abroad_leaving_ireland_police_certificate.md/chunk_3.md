##  What is a Police Certificate for?

The Garda√≠ will only issue you with a [ Police Certificate in certain limited
circumstances ](https://www.garda.ie/en/about-us/online-services/data-
protection-foi-police-certificates/police-certificates.html) . This includes
if you need it to:

  1. Apply to a foreign consular authority 
  2. Apply for a foreign visa 
  3. Start a business in another EU State 

A Police Certificate is not the same as the [ Garda vetting
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/employment/employment-rights-and-
conditions/data-protection-at-work/garda-vetting/) required for anyone who
works or volunteers with children or vulnerable adults.
