###  Irish people living abroad

Generally, if you are an Irish person living abroad it is not possible to get
a Police Certificate from Ireland unless you need it for:

  * Visa purposes 
  * Applying for residency in another country 

However, if you are living abroad and require a Police Certificate from
Ireland for something like a job, you could get in touch with the local police
in the country where you now live. Explain to them what you require and they
may get in touch on your behalf with your nearest police station here in
Ireland and request this information.
