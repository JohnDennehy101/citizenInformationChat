##  Summer education programme

The [ Summer Programme ](/en/education/special-education-needs/summer-
education-programme/) (also called _July Provision_ ) provides funding for
special schools and mainstream primary schools with special classes to extend
their education services during the summer holiday period. The funding may
also cover transport for the children.

A [ home-based summer programme
](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/a0e87-summer-provision-home-based-
programme/) is available to certain children, if their school is not
participating in the Summer Programme or cannot offer them a place.
