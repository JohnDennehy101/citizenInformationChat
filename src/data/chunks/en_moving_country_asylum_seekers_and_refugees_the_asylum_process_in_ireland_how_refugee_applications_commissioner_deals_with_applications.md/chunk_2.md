##  Introduction

This page has information about how the International Protection Office (IPO)
assesses your application for international protection.

The IPO will decide if your application is admissible following the
preliminary interview.

If your application is admissible, you will be given a questionnaire to
complete. Later you will attend a personal interview. The IPO will then decide
what to recommend to the Minister for Justice regarding your application. You
