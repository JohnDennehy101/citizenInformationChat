###  Arriving from a safe third country

Your application is also inadmissible if you arrived from a [ safe third
country ](https://home-affairs.ec.europa.eu/pages/glossary/safe-third-
country_en) . For a country to be considered safe for you, the IPO should
consider the following:

  * Your connection to that country. This includes the length of time you lived there, any relatives or people you are in a relationship with who are in that country, and any cultural connections you have to that country. 
  * If you will be allowed to re-enter that country 
  * The likelihood that you will be subjected to torture, other inhuman or degrading treatment there, or the death penalty.
